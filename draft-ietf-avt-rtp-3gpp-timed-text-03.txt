   Abstract 
    
   This document specifies an RTP payload format for the transmission of 
   3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) timed text.  3GPP timed 
   text is a time-lined decorated text media format with defined storage 
   in a 3GP file.  Timed Text can be synchronized with audio/video 
   contents.  As of today, 3GP files containing timed text contents can 
   only be downloaded via HTTP.  There is no available mechanism for 
   streaming 3GPP timed text contents neither out of 3GP files nor 
   directly from live content.  In the following sections the problems 
   of streaming timed text are addressed and a payload format for 
   streaming 3GPP timed text over RTP is specified.

   Changes from draft-ietf-avt-rtp-3gpp-timed-text-02 
    
   - aggregation scheme much simplified inline with RFC 3640.  Section  
     2.3.4. 
   - headers correspondingly updated.  SDUR added to TYPE 3/4. 
   - text string length and byte order mark are pulled out of the

1. Terminology 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [5]. 
    
   Furthermore, the following terms are used and have specific meaning 
   within the context of this document: 
    
   text sample or whole text sample or text access unit: 
    
        In the 3GPP Timed Text media format [1] this refers to a unit of 
        timed text data as contained in the source file.  Its equivalent 
        in audio/video would be a frame.  A text sample contains text 
        strings followed by zero or more modifier boxes.   
         
        In MPEG a text sample is also referred as a 'text access unit'. 
         
        In this document, the definition of text sample is different 
        that in the 3GPP Timed Text media format [1].  Here, a text 
        sample does not include the text string length field and the 
        byte order mark.  These pieces of information are signaled using 
        the payload headers. 
    
   fragment or text sample fragment:  
    
        a fraction of a text sample.  A fragment may contain either text 
        strings or modifier (decoration) contents, but not both at the 
        same time. 
    
    
   sample contents:

        general term to identify timed text data transported when using 
        this payload format.   
         
    
   text strings: 
    
        text strings is the term used to denote the actual text 
        characters encoded either as UTF-8 [18] or UTF-16 [19].  This 
        text string MUST NOT contain any byte order mark (BOM).  This 
        differs from the definition in the 3GPP Timed Text media format 
        [1], where an UTF-16 text string does include a BOM.  In this 
        payload format the BOM is not needed as explained in Section 
        3.1.1.   
    
    
   decoration/modifiers:  
    
        the terms "decoration" and "modifiers" are used interchangeably 
        throughout the document to denote the contents of the text 
        sample that modify the default text formatting.  Modifiers may, 
        for example, specify different font size for a particular 
        sequence of characters or define karaoke timing for the sample. 
         
    
   sample description: 
    
        this term is used to denote information which is potentially 
        shared by more than one text sample, and in a 3GPP file is 
        stored in a place where it can be shared.  It contains setup and 
        default information such as scrolling direction, text box 
        position, delay value, default font, background color, etc.   
         
         
   units or transport units: 
    
        the payload headers specified in this document encapsulate text 
        samples, fragments thereof and sample descriptions by prepending 
        a specific payload header and so building what is here called a 
        (transport) unit. 
         
         
   aggregation / aggregate packet 
    
        An aggregate RTP packet consists of several units. 
         
 
   track / stream 
    
        3GP files contain audio/video and text tracks.  This document 
        enables to stream text tracks using RTP.  Therefore both terms 
        are exchanged in this document in the context of 3GP files.

   Media Header Box / Track Header Box / ... 
    
        the 3GP file format makes use of these structures defined in the 
        ISO Base File Format [2].  When referring to these in this 
        document, initials are capitalized for clarity. 
    
    
2. Introduction 
    
   3GPP timed text is a media format for time-lined decorated text 
   specified in [1].  3GPP Timed text contents may be stored in 3GP 
   files or may be generated in real time.  The 3GP file format itself 
   is based on the ISO Base Media File Format recommendation [2].  
   Section 12.2 gives some insight into the 3GP file structure.   
    
   The purpose of this draft is to provide a means to stream 3GPP timed 
   text contents using RTP.  This includes the streaming of timed text 
   being read out of a 3GP file as well as the streaming of timed text 
   generated in real time, a.k.a. live streaming. 
    
2.1 General Overview of the 3GPP Timed Text format 
    
   The 3GPP timed text format was developed for use in the services 
   specified in the 3GPP Transparent End-to-end Packet-switched 
   Streaming Services (3GPP PSS) [16].  Besides plain text, the 3GPP 
   timed text format allows the display of decorated text: like for 
   karaoke applications, scrolling text for newscasts or hyperlinked 
   text.  Furthermore, these contents may or may not be synchronized 
   with other media, like audio or video.   
    
   The scope of the 3GPP PSS includes both downloading and streaming of 
   multimedia content over 3G packet-switched networks.  However, due to 
   the lack of an appropriate RTP payload format, the current usage of 
   the 3GPP timed text file format is limited to downloading via HTTP. 
    
   The 3GPP PSS adopts multimedia codecs (such as MPEG-4 Visual, AMR, 
   MPEG-4 AAC, and JPEG) and protocols like SMIL [9] for presentation 
   layouts or RTP [3] for streaming.  In general, a multimedia 
   presentation might consist of several audio/video/text streams (or 
   tracks in ISO file format jargon).  Different streams may have 
   different formats.  The media may be spatially synchronized either 
   using the information within the streams or a scene description 
   language like SMIL.   
    
   An example of this would be a media session with three different 
   media streams: 1 audio, 1 video and 1 timed text that reproduces a 
   music video with karaoke subtitles.  For each stream some information 
   is needed, which defines the regions where each media is displayed, 
   how the media looks like and its synchronization, among other things.  
   In karaoke, for example, the song lyrics may be displayed below the 
   music video and the words are highlighted synchronized with the music 
   track.

   Internet Draft  RTP Payload Format for 3GPP Timed Text  July 15, 2004 
    
    
    
   Four differentiated functional components might be identified in the 
   3GPP timed text media format: 
    
        o initial spatial layout information related to the text track: 
          these are the height and width of the text region where text 
          is displayed, the position of the text region in the display 
          and the layer or proximity of the text to the user.  These 
          pieces of information are contained in the Track Header Box.  
          Sections 6.1 and 12 provide further details. 
         
        o default settings for formatting and positioning of text: 
          style (font, size, colour,...), background colour, horizontal 
          and vertical justification, line width, scrolling, etcetera.  
          Sample descriptions contain such settings.   
         
        o the actual text: encoded characters using either UTF-8 [18] 
          or UTF-16 [19] encoding and, 
         
        o the decoration inside the modifier boxes: if some characters 
          have different style, some delay, blink, etcetera... this 
          needs to be indicated by appending the modifier boxes to the 
          text strings.  Modifier boxes are only present in the text 
          samples if they are actually needed.  Otherwise, the default 
          settings in the corresponding sample description apply.  At 
          the time of writing this payload format the following 
          decorations or modifiers are specified in the 3GPP timed text 
          media format specification [1]: 
         
            - text highlight, 
            - highlight color, 
            - blinking text, 
            - karaoke feature, 
            - hyperlink, 
            - text delay, 
            - text style and, 
            - positioning of the text box and, 
            - text wrap indication. 
      
   Section 12.3 specifies where to find these values in the 3GP file and 
   how these are mapped to the payload format.  For live streaming, 
   appropriate values using the same formats and units shall be used. 
    
   For further details on the 3GPP Timed Text media format, refer to 
   [1].   
    
    
2.2 Requirements for a payload format for 3GPP timed text 
    
   In this section a set of requirements is listed.  A justification for 
   each of them is also given.  An RTP Payload Format for 3GPP timed 
   text SHALL: 
    
     
   Rey & Matsui                                               [Page 6] 
   Internet Draft  RTP Payload Format for 3GPP Timed Text  July 15, 2004 
    
    
        1.  Keep the 3GP text sample structure.  This requirement means 
   that it SHALL be possible for an RTP receiver using this payload 
   format to rebuild the text samples from the received RTP packets.  
    
        2.  Transmit the text sample size, sample duration and sample 
   description index in-band.  In RTP it is important to transmit it in-
   band because this information might change from sample to sample.   
    
        3.  Enable the transmission of the sample descriptions both by 
   out-of-band and in-band means.  Typically, a set of default 
   formatting settings is transmitted once at the initialization phase.  
   If more sample descriptions are need, these may be sent also out-of-
   band.  However, sending them in-band is easier and more efficient.  
   Sample descriptions may become large so that out-of-band transmission 
   might not be the most appropriate transport method.  Additionally, 
   out-of-band channels might not be always available.  For these 
   reasons, the payload format SHALL also enable in-band transmission of 
   sample description information.  This is especially useful for live 
   streaming, where contents are not known a priori. 
    
        4.  Enable the aggregation of units into an RTP packet.  In a 
   mobile communication environment a typical text sample size is around 
   100-200 bytes.  Transporting several units in one RTP packet makes 
   the transport more efficient. 
    
        5.  Enable the fragmentation of a text sample into several RTP 
   packets in order to cover a wide range of applications and network 
   environments.  In general, fragmentation should be a rare event given 
   the low bit rates and text sample sizes.  However, the 3GPP Timed 
   Text media format does allow for larger text samples.  The payload 
   format SHALL take this into account and provide a means for coping 
   with fragmentation.  Consequently, the reassembly of the original 
   text samples SHALL be possible. 
    
        6.  Enable the use of resilient transport mechanisms, such as 
   repetition, retransmissions [11] and FEC [7].  These mechanisms may 
   be used to protect the information.  RFC 2354 [8] discusses available 
   mechanisms for stream repair. 
    
2.3 General Remarks 
    
   Before going into the details of the payload headers, some general 
   observations are made in this section.  These should help the reader 
   in understanding the design decisions. 
    
   In order to understand the next sections a rough functional 
   description of the units is needed: 
    
        o a TYPE 1 unit contains one complete text sample, 
        o a TYPE 2 unit transports a complete text string or a fragment 
          thereof, 
        o a TYPE 3 unit contains the complete modifiers or only the 
          first fragment thereof, 
     
   Rey & Matsui                                               [Page 7] 
   Internet Draft  RTP Payload Format for 3GPP Timed Text  July 15, 2004 
    
    
        o a TYPE 4 unit contains one modifier fragment other than the  
          first and, 
        o a TYPE 5 unit contains one sample description. 
    
2.3.1 Character Counting 
    
   This payload format does not enable an RTP receiver to find out the 
   exact number of text characters lost. 
    
   The fragment size included in the payload headers does not help in 
   finding the number of lost characters, because the UTF-8/UTF-16 
   [18][19] encodings used yield a variable number of bytes per 
   character.   
    
        Informative note: for finding out the exact number of lost 
        characters, an additional field in TYPE 2 units and character 
        counting upon fragmentation would be required.  This overhead 
        does not seem reasonable given the expected low rate of 
        fragmentation. 
    
2.3.2 On the length indication in the units  
 
   Usually, RTP applications use the information on packet size from UDP 
   or lower layers to find out the length of the RTP payload.  While 
   this information can still be used, this payload format includes an 
   explicit length indication for each unit in the payload as a fixed 
   field in the payload headers.   
    
   This design choice allows easy interoperability with the RTP Payload 
   Format for Transport of MPEG-4 Elementary Streams, RFC 3640 [12], 
   which does require an explicit length indication for each unit (see 
   AU-header in RFC 3640).   
    
2.3.3 Fragmentation of Timed Text Samples 
    
   This section describes why text samples may have to be fragmented and 
   discusses some of the possible approaches to do it.  A solution is 
   proposed together with rules and recommendations for fragmenting and 
   transporting text samples using this payload format. 
    
   3GPP Timed Text applications are expected to operate at low bit rates.  
   This fact added to the small size of timed text samples (typically 
   one or two hundred bytes) makes fragmentation of text samples a rare 
   event.  Samples should usually fit into the MTU size of the used 
   network path. 
    
   Nevertheless, some text strings (e.g. ending roll in a movie) and 
   some modifier boxes (i.e. for hyperlinks, for karaoke or for styles) 
   might become large.  This may also apply for future modifier boxes.  
   In such cases, the first option to consider is whether it is possible 
   to adjust the encoding (e.g. the size of sample) in such a way that 
   fragmentation is avoided.  If so, this is preferred to fragmentation 
   and SHOULD be done.   
     
   Rey & Matsui                                               [Page 8] 
   Internet Draft  RTP Payload Format for 3GPP Timed Text  July 15, 2004 
    
    
    
   Otherwise, if this is not possible or other constraints avoid doing 
   this, fragmentation MAY be used and the basic guidelines given in 
   this document MUST be followed.   
    
   o whenever possible, whole text samples (TYPE 1) SHOULD be 
     aggregated into RTP packets, using the payload headers defined in 
     this document.  This increases transport efficiency.  Fragments of 
     a text sample (TYPEs 2, 3 and 4) SHALL NOT be aggregated in the 
     same payload.  See Section 2.3.4 for details. 
    
   o it is RECOMMENDED that text samples are fragmented as seldom as 
     possible, i.e. the least possible number of fragments are created 
     out of a text sample.  Since fragments are sent in own RTP packets 
     the overhead may be considerable if fragmentation is done too 
     often. 
    
   o if there is some bitrate and space in the payload available, 
     sample descriptions (if available) SHOULD be aggregated.  Sample 
     descriptions (TYPE 5 units) MAY be placed anywhere in an aggregate 
     payload, since the sample index (SIDX) is used to associate them 
     to their text samples (explained further in this document).   
    
   o text strings MUST split at character boundaries.  Otherwise, it is 
     not possible to display the text contents of a fragment if a 
     previous fragment was lost.  As a consequence, text string 
     fragmentation requires knowledge of the UTF-8/UTF-16 encoding 
     formats to determine character boundaries. 
    
   o unlike text strings, the modifier boxes are NOT REQUIRED to split 
     at meaningful boundaries.  As a consequence, this payload format 
     does not ensure that partially received modifiers can be applied 
     to text strings.  It is an application issue how to deal with 
     these modifiers, i.e. whether to use them or not.   
    
        Informative note: ensuring that partially received modifiers can 
        be applied to text strings in all cases (for all modifier types 
        and for all fragment loss constellation) would place additional 
        requirements on the payload format.  In particular this would 
        require that: a) senders understand the semantics of the 
        modifier boxes and b) specific fragment headers for each of the 
        modifier boxes are defined, in addition to the payload formats 
        defined below.  Given the low probability of fragmentation and 
        the desire to keep the requirements low, it does not seem 
        reasonable to include such additional headers. 
    
   o modifier and text string fragments SHOULD be protected against 
     packet losses, i.e. using FEC [7], retransmission [11], repetition 
     (Section 4) or an equivalent technique.  This minimizes the  
    
   o an additional requirement when fragmenting text samples is that 
     the start of the modifiers MUST be indicated using the payload 
     header defined for that purpose, i.e. a TYPE 3 unit MUST be used 
     
   Rey & Matsui                                               [Page 9]

     (see below).  Otherwise, if packets are lost, a client may be 
     unable to identify where the modifiers start and the text ends or 
     whether either text strings or modifiers were received completely 
     or not.  Note that the text string length included in the text 
     samples can be used to easily find the modifier start byte (see 
     [1] for details). 
    
   o finally, sample descriptions SHALL NOT be fragmented, because they 
     contain important information that may affect several text 
     samples.   
    
2.3.4 On aggregate payloads 
    
   An RTP payload using this payload format MUST contain either: 
    
   o one or more whole text samples (TYPE 1) and zero or more sample 
     descriptions (TYPE 5) or,   
   o zero or one text string fragments (TYPE 2) and zero or more sample 
     descriptions or, 
   o zero or one modifier fragments (TYPE 3 or TYPE 4) and zero or more 
     sample descriptions. 
    
     Note that payloads MAY also be empty as a special case for TYPE 1 
     units. 
    
   Different payloads that those listed above MUST NOT be used.   
    
   Note that only more that one whole text sample (TYPE 1) MAY be 
   aggregated in a payload and that TYPE 5 units MAY be placed anywhere 
   in the aggregate and they SHALL NOT be regarded for calculating the 
   timestamp of the subsequent units.  This is because they usually do 
   not belong to any text sample in particular, but are shared by 
   several.  For timestamp calculations, TYPE 5 units MUST simply be 
   ignored, i.e. by jumping to the next unit.   
    
   The reasons for explicitly disallowing the aggregation of fragments 
   are simplicity and the negligible loss of efficiency caused by 
   sending fragments in own payloads.  Filling up the remaining bits 
   with sample descriptions (where possible) shall help further minimize 
   this effect.  
    
   Some possibilities for aggregate payloads are illustrated in the 
   Figure 1 below (not scaled).

                   Figure 1. Example aggregate payloads. 
    
   Referring to the Figure 1 b) we will illustrate how the timestamp for 
   each unit is found.  Assuming rtptsy represents the standard RTP 
   timestamp for PAYLOAD y, sdurx the duration of unit x and tsx is the 
   timestamp for unit x, the tsx can be found as the sum of rtptsy plus 
   the cumulative sum of the durations of preceding units in that 
   payload: 
    
          1. for the units in the first aggregate payload, PAYLOAD 1:  
           
                        ts1= rtpts1,  
                        ts2= rtpts1 + sdur1, 
                        ts3= rtpts1 + sdur1 + sdur2,  
                         
          (Note that no sdur value is assigned to TYPE 5  
           units, and they are taken into account in the timestamp 
           calculation.) 
                         
          2. for PAYLOAD 2: 
                
                        ts3= rtpts2, 
                         
                         
          3. for PAYLOAD 3:  
                        ts4= rtpsts2= rtpts3 
    
          In this case rtpts3 must be equal to rtpts2 in order to be 
          able to assign this fragment to the correct sample.  See also 
          section below. 
 
2.3.5 Reassembling text samples at the receiver 
 
   The payload headers defined in this document allow reassembling 
   fragmented text samples.  For this purpose the standard RTP timestamp, 
   the duration indication (SDUR) and the total and subtotal counters 
   (see TOTAL, THIS) field of the payload headers are used.   
    
   The process for collecting the different fragments of a text sample 
   is as follows: 
    
     1. Fragments of the same text sample MUST resolve to the same 
        timestamp value.  Therefore, within the received units, search 
        for those having the same timestamp value.  The timestamp 
        indicates the time when the unit first becomes active (i.e. 
        shall be presented).  The duration field indicates how long the 
     
   Rey & Matsui                                              [Page 11] 
   Internet Draft  RTP Payload Format for 3GPP Timed Text  July 15, 2004 
    
    
        contents are active and, at the same time, is used to calculate 
        the timestamp of subsequent units in the payload (only for TYPE 
        1 units).  This mechanism was illustrated in the section above. 
      
     2. check whether any of the fragments of the text sample is missing.  
        This is done using the TOTAL and THIS fields; the TOTAL field 
        indicates how many fragments were created out of the text sample 
        and the THIS field indicates the position of this fragment in 
        the text sample.  As result of this operation two outcomes are 
        possible: 
      
          a. no fragment is missing.  Then the THIS field SHALL be used 
             to order the fragments and reassemble the text sample 
             before forwarding it to the decoding application.  Special 
             care SHALL be taken when reassembling the text string as 
             per 4 below. 
           
          b. one or more fragments are missing: check whether this 
             fragment belongs to the text string or to the modifiers: 
             TYPE 2 units identify text strings, TYPE 3 and 4 modifiers: 
           
              i. if the fragment or fragments missing belongs to the 
                  text string and the modifiers were received complete, 
                  then the remaining text characters MAY still be 
                  displayed as plain text or, in certain cases, applying 
                  modifiers.  Modifiers MAY only be applied as long as 
                  it is possible to identify the character numbers, e.g. 
                  if only last text string fragment is lost.  This is 
                  the case for modifiers defining specific font styles 
                  ('styl'), highlighted characters ('hlit'), karaoke 
                  feature ('krok)' and blinking characters ('blnk').  
                  Other modifiers such as 'dlay' or 'tbox' can be 
                  applied without the need of the character number.  It 
                  is an application issue to decide whether to use apply 
                  the modifiers or not.  
                 
             ii. if the fragment missing belongs to the modifiers and 
                  the text strings were received complete, then the 
                  incomplete modifiers MAY be used.  Since modifiers are 
                  split without observing meaningful boundaries, it is 
                  not possible to always ensure that partially received 
                  modifiers can be applied to the text strings in all 
                  cases.  This is, again, an application issue.  The 
                  text string SHOULD at least be displayed as plain text.   
                 
            iii. a third possibility is that it is not possible to 
                  discern whether modifiers or text strings were 
                  received complete.  E.g. if the TYPE 3 unit of a 
                  sample plus the following or preceding packet is lost, 
                  there is no way for the RTP receiver to know if one if 
                  these lost packets belong only to the modifiers or 
                  also to the text strings.  FEC [7], retransmission

                  [11] or other protection mechanisms as per section 4 
                  are RECOMMENDED to avoid this situation.   
                 
             iv. finally, if it is sure that neither text strings nor 
                  modifiers were received complete, then the text 
                  strings MAY, similarly to the case above, be displayed 
                  partially or MAY be discarded.  This is an application 
                  choice.   
                 
     3. Sample descriptions SHALL NOT be fragmented, thus they are 
        directly associated via the sample description index (SIDX) with 
        the reassembled text samples. 
      
     4. Reassembling of text strings: since the text strings MUST NOT 
        include any byte order mark (BOM), the receiver MUST prepend it 
        to the reassembled string(if needed) before handling it to the 
        decoder.  In particular, this is needed for UTF-16 encoded 
        strings (i.e. "U" bit is set to 1).  The value of the BOM is 
        0xFEFF (see [1]) and it is used by the 3GPP timed text decoder 
        to recognize the UTF encoding. 
      
2.3.6 Live streaming vs. Streaming from a 3GP file 
    
   This section addresses the differences between streaming live content 
   and streaming text tracks from a 3GP file. 
    
   For the purpose of this document, the term live streaming refers to 
   those scenarios where the timed text stream is transported without 
   necessarily storing it in a 3GP file.  The sender application SHALL 
   encapsulate these contents into RTP packets following the guidelines 
   given in this document. At the receiving side, a buffer is typically 
   used to cancel the network delay and delay jitter.  If the receiver 
   buffer is large enough and the sender uses packet loss resilience 
   (i.e. retransmission [11], packet FEC [7] or other) it may also be 
   possible to recover from packet losses.  Note that the form in which 
   the contents are actually stored in both sender and receiver and how 
   the buffers are dimensioned are implementation design choices. 
    
   Section 12.3 specifies how the 3GP file parameter values are mapped 
   to the fields of the payload header.  For live streaming, appropriate 
   values complying with the format and units described in [1] shall be 
   used.  Where needed, clarifications on appropriate values are given 
   in this document.

      |                                                               |

   Marker bit (M): the marker bit SHALL be set to 1 if the RTP packet 
   includes one or more whole text samples or the last fragment of a 
   text sample; otherwise set to 0.   
    
   Timestamp: the timestamp MUST indicate the sampling instant of the 
   earliest (or only) unit contained in the RTP packet.  The initial 
   value MUST be randomly determined.  In an aggregate payload, units 
   MUST be placed in play-out order, i.e. earliest first in the payload.  
   The timestamp of the subsequent units MUST be obtained by adding the 
   timed text sample duration of previous samples to the RTP timestamp 
   value.  An example of how to calculate the timestamp of units in an 
   aggregate payload can be found in Section 2.3.4.    
    
   Note that TYPE 5 units do not make use of the timestamp and therefore 
   the above does not apply in this particular case. 
    
   The timestamp clockrate of the samples in each text track is the 
   value of the "timescale" parameter in the Media Header Box for that 
   text track.  Note that each track in a 3GP file MAY have its own 
   clockrate as specified in the Media Header Box.   
    
   For live streaming an appropriate timestamp clockrate SHALL be used.  
   A default value of 1000 Hz is RECOMMENDED.  This value should provide 
   enough timing resolution for synchronizing text with other media and 
   expressing the duration of text samples.  Other clockrates MAY be 
   used.  Timestamp clockrates MUST be signaled by out-of-band means at 
   session setup, e.g. using the "rate" attribute in SDP.  See Section 8 
   for details.   
    
   Unlike in other media like audio or video, no default sample size or 
   sampling rate is defined for timed text.  For 3GP files the length of 
   the text samples is calculated beforehand and included in the track 
   itself and for live encoding, it is the real time encoder that SHALL 
   choose an appropriate size for each text sample.  In general, the 
   amount of text 'captured' in a sample depends on the text source (see 
   examples below).  Furthermore, samples may be tailored to match the 
   packet MTU as close as possible or to provide a given redundancy for 
   the available bit rate.  The encoding application MUST also take into 
   account the delay constraints of the real-time session and assess 
   whether FEC, retransmission or other similar techniques are 
   reasonable options for stream repair.   
    
     
   Rey & Matsui                                              [Page 14] 
   Internet Draft  RTP Payload Format for 3GPP Timed Text  July 15, 2004 
    
    
   The following examples shall illustrate how a real-time encoder may 
   choose its settings: 
    
        Imagine a news program scenario, where the news is transcribed 
        and synchronized with the image of the reporter and the 
        headlines in the background.  Assuming that a person can read an 
        average of 4-6 words per second, at an average word length of 5 
        characters plus one space per word, an available IP MTU of 576 
        bytes, characters are encoded using 2-bytes, no modifiers are 
        used and a rate of 576*8bits per second=4.6Kbps is available, a 
        text sample covering 60 seconds of text would theoretically be 
        optimum: IP/UDP/RTP+(text sample)=20+8+18 (12+6, TYPE 1 header) 
        + ~250*2= ~546 bytes < 576 bytes.  However, a delay of sixty 
        seconds might be too much and just one packet per sample too low 
        of a redundancy.  In practice, the allowed delay for real time 
        communications is typically a few seconds, e.g. 3s.  Thus, the 
        encoder could sample text every 1s (yielding RTP payloads of 
        ~14-18 bytes), encapsulate the current and last two samples in 
        every RTP packet (accounting to an IP packet size of 98 bytes) 
        and send the packet six times, thus exhausting the available bit 
        rate and increasing packet loss resilience.   
         
        Another example would be a user sending timed text from a type-
        in area in the display.  A solution here would be that as soon 
        as the user clicks the 'send' button a new text sample is 
        created. 
         
        In a video conferencing application, text is synchronized with 
        audio and video.  Thus, the text samples must meet several 
        requirements: they shall be displayed long enough to be read by 
        a human, shall fit in the video screen and shall 'capture' the 
        audio contents rendered during that time.   
         
        Therefore, it can be concluded that encoding application shall 
        adapt to the scenario constraints.   
    
   Payload Type (PT): the payload type is set dynamically and sent by 
   out-of-band means. 
    
   The usage of the remaining RTP header fields follows the rules of RTP 
   [3] and the profile in use.

   The payload headers specified in this document consist of a set of 
   common fields followed by specific fields for each header type and 
   sample contents.  See Figure 3. 
    
   In this manner, the structure of the payload headers resembles that 
   of the 'access units' (AU) in RFC 3640 [12].  This similarity is 
   intentional to improve interoperability.  The 'AU header' of that 
   document finds an equivalent in the common header fields: U, R, TYPE 
   and LEN.  Similarly, the specific fields plus the sample contents 
   would be equivalent to the 'AU data section' in RFC 3640.  This is 
   illustrated in the figure below.

3.1.1 Unit Header Format 
    
   The common fields to all headers in the unit header have the 
   following format: 
    
            0                   1                   2

   Where: 
    
   o U (1 bit) "UTF Transformation flag": indicates whether the text 
     characters are encoded using UTF-8 (U=0) or UTF-16 (U=1).  This is 
     used to inform RTP receivers whether UTF-8 or UTF-16 was used to 
     encode the text string and so enable to display text string 
     fragments.  For the payload formats defined in this document, the 
     U bit is only used in TYPE 1 and TYPE 2 headers.  Senders MUST set 
     the U bit to zero in TYPE 3, TYPE 4 and TYPE 5 headers.  Receivers 
     MUST ignore the U bit in TYPE 3, TYPE 4 and TYPE 5 headers.   
    
   o R (4 bits) "Reserved bits": for future extensions.  This field 
     MUST be set to zero (0x0) and MUST be ignored by receivers.

   Internet Draft  RTP Payload Format for 3GPP Timed Text  July 15, 2004 
    
    
   o TYPE (3 bits) "Type Field": this field specifies which specific 
     header fields follow.  The following TYPE values are defined: 
    
        - TYPE 1, for a whole text sample 
        - TYPE 2, for a text string fragment 
        - TYPE 3, for a whole modifier box or the first fragment of a 
        modifier box  
        - TYPE 4, for a modifier fragment other than first. 
        - TYPE 5, for a sample description.  One header per sample 
          description.  
        - TYPE 0, 6 and 7 are reserved. 
         
        Two TYPEs (1 & 2) are defined for units containing text strings, 
        another two (3 & 4) for units not containing text strings and a 
        final TYPE 5 for sample descriptions.  See details in 
        subsections below. 
    
   o Finally, the LEN (16 bits) "Length Field": indicates the size (in 
     bytes) of this header field and all the fields following, i.e. the 
     LEN field followed by the unit payload (text strings and 
     modifiers, if any).   
    
     In order to calculate the LEN value, information on the text 
     sample length in the Sample Size Box (see Section 12.3) in 3GP 
     files MAY used.   
      
     For live streaming, both sample length and the LEN value for the 
     current fragment MUST be calculated during the sampling process or 
     during fragmentation.   
    
     LEN may take the following values: 
    
      - TYPE = 1, LEN >= 8,  
      - TYPE = 2, LEN >= 9,  
      - TYPE = 3, LEN > 6,  
      - TYPE = 4, LEN > 6 and,  
      - TYPE = 5, LEN > 3.  
      
     In the next subsection the different payload headers for the 
     values of TYPE are specified.

   This header type is used to transport whole text samples.  If several 
   text samples are sent in an RTP packet, every sample is preceded by 
   its own header (see Figure 4). 
    
   Note that also empty text samples are considered whole text samples, 
   although they do not contain sample contents.  In this particular 
   case, TYPE 1 units MUST NOT include any sample contents and the LEN 
   field SHALL have a value of 8 (0x0008).  Otherwise, the LEN field 
   SHALL be always greater than 8 (0x0008).   
    
   The fields above have the following meaning: 
    
   o U, R and TYPE as defined above. 
    
   o SIDX (8 bits) "Text Sample Entry Index": this is an index used to 
     identify the sample descriptions.   
    
     The SIDX field is used to find the sample description 
     corresponding to the unit's payload.  There are two types of SIDX 
     values: static and dynamic. 
    
     Static SIDX values are used to identify sample descriptions that 
     MUST be sent out-of-band and MUST remain active during the whole 
     session.  The transport of sample descriptions out-of-band is a 
     MANDATORY feature.  A static SIDX value is unequivocally linked to 
     one particular sample description during the whole session.  It 
     SHOULD be avoided that many sample descriptions are carried out-
     of-band, since these may become large and, ultimately, transport 
     is not the goal of the out-of-band channel.  Thus, this feature 
     MUST be limited to those sample descriptions that provide a set of 
     minimum default format settings.  Static SIDX values MUST fall in 
     the (inclusive) interval [129,254].  The default start value MUST 
     be 129. 
      
     Dynamic SIDX values are used for sample descriptions sent in-band.  
     Sample descriptions MAY be sent in-band for several reasons: 
     because they are generated in real time, for transport resiliency 
     or both.  A dynamic SIDX value is unequivocally linked to one 
     particular sample description during the period in which this is 
     active in the session and it SHALL NOT be modified during that 
     period.  This period MAY be smaller than or equal to the session 
     duration.  A maximum of 64 dynamic active SIDX is allowed at any 
     moment.  Dynamic SIDX values MUST fall in the inclusive interval 
     [0,127].  This should be enough for both, recorded content and 
     live streaming applications.  Nevertheless, a wraparound mechanism 
     is provided in Section 12 to handle sessions where more than 64 
     SIDX values might be needed in a session.  Servers MAY make use of 
     dynamic sample descriptions.  Clients MUST be able to receive and 
     interpret dynamic sample descriptions. 
      
     SIDX values 128 and 255 are reserved for future use.

   o SDUR (24 bits) "Text Sample Duration": indicates the sample 
     duration in RTP timestamp units of the text sample.  For this 
     field, a length of 3 bytes is preferred to 2 bytes.  This is 
     because, for a typical clockrate of 1000 Hz, 16 bits would allow 
     for a maximum duration of just 65 seconds, which might be too 
     short for some streams.   
      
     Apart from defining the time period during which the text is 
     displayed, the duration field is also used to find the timestamp 
     of any subsequent units within the RTP packet. 
        
     Text samples have generally a known duration at the time of 
     transmission.  However, in some cases like live streaming, the 
     time at which a text piece shall be presented might not be known a 
     priori.  For this case, the value zero SDUR=0 (0x000000) is 
     reserved to signal unknown duration.  Upon storing a text sample 
     with SDUR=0 in a 3GP file, the SDUR value MUST be changed to the 
     effective duration of the text sample, which MUST be always 
     greater than zero (note that the ISO file format [2] explicitly 
     forbids a sample duration of zero).  The effective duration MUST 
     be calculated as the timestamp difference between the current 
     sample with unknown duration and the next text sample that is 
     displayed. 
      
     For all other cases SDUR MUST be different from zero (0x000000).   
      
     The next example illustrates how units of unknown duration MUST be 
     presented.  If no text sample following is available, it is an 
     implementation issue what should be displayed.  E.g. a server 
     could send an empty sample to clear the text box. 
      
        Example: let us revisit the previous example, imagine now you 
        are in an airport watching the latest news report while you wait 
        for your plane.  Airports are loud, so the news report is 
        transcribed in the lower area of the screen.  This area displays 
        two lines of text: the headlines and the words spoken by the 
        news speaker.  As usual, the headlines are shown for a longer 
        time than the rest.  This time is, in principle, unknown to the 
        stream server.  A headline is just replaced when the next 
        headline is displayed. 
      
     Note that samples of unknown duration SHALL NOT use features, such 
     as scrolling or karaoke, which require knowledge of the duration 
     of the sample up front.  Furthermore, only TYPE 5 MAY follow units 
     of unknown duration in the same aggregate payload.  Otherwise, for 
     other unit types it would not be possible to resolve their 
     timestamp.   
    
     For text stored in 3GP files, see Section 12.3 for details on how 
     to extract the duration value.  For live streaming, live encoders 
     SHALL assign appropriate values and units according to [1] and 
     later releases.

   o TLEN (16 bits), "Text String Length", is a byte-count of the text 
     string.  TLEN is needed by the decoder to know where the modifiers 
     in the payload start.  This field MUST precede the BOM, byte order 
     mark, (if present) in the text string handled to the decoder.  If 
     the BOM is present, then the TLEN MUST be increased in two units 
     to cover the BOM.   
      
     TLEN is not present in text string fragments (TYPE 2) since it can 
     be deductively calculated from the LEN values of each fragment.  
     Also in this case, the same measures for reassembling the text 
     string apply. 
    
   o Finally, the unit payload following the SDUR field consists of a 
     string of characters encoded using either the UTF-8 or UTF-16 
     encodings followed by zero or more modifiers.  If UTF-16 is used, 
     the text string in the unit is different from that included in the 
     original 3GP file sample in that the 16-bit byte order mark (BOM, 
     see [1]) preceding the actual characters MUST NOT be included.  
     Instead, the U bit in the unit header MUST be used to indicate 
     UTF-16 encoding.  The BOM MUST be reinserted at the receiver (if 
     needed) in order to reassemble the original text sample.  The same 
     reasoning applies to the text string length.

   This header type is used to transport text string fragments: 
    
   o The U, R, TYPE, SIDX, and SDUR fields have similar interpretation 
     as above.  The U, SIDX and SDUR fields are meaningful since 
     partial text strings can also be displayed. 
    
   o The LEN field (16 bits) has the same meaning as above.  It MUST 
     always be greater than nine (0x0009). 
    
     As mentioned in Section 2.3.3 text strings MUST be split at 
     character boundaries to allow the display of text fragments.  
     Hence, as a minimum a text fragment MUST contain one character in 
     either UTF-8 or UTF-16.  This is just a formalism, since by 
     following the fragmentation guidelines much larger fragments 
     should be created.   
      
        Note also, that TYPE 2 units do not contain an explicit text 
        string length (like TLEN in TYPE 1).  If all TYPE 2 units of a

        sample are received the original string length can be obtained 
        deductively from the LEN of the fragments.  However, the text 
        string length is not needed to find the modifiers in a 
        fragmented sample because the TYPE 3 header is explicitly used 
        to indicate the start of the modifiers. 
    
   o The SLEN field (16 bits) indicates the size (in bytes) of the 
     original (whole) text sample to which this fragment belongs.  This 
     length comprises the text string plus any modifier boxes present 
     (and does not include the byte order mark and the text string 
     length as mentioned in the Terminology section).   
    
     For stored content, see Section 12.3 for details on how to find 
     the SLEN value in a 3GP file.  For live content, the SLEN MUST be 
     obtained during the sampling process.   
    
     Clients MAY use SLEN to buffer space for the remaining fragments 
     of the text sample.   
    
   o The fields TOTAL (4 bits) and THIS (4 bits) indicate the total 
     number of fragments in which the original text sample (i.e. text 
     string and its modifiers) has been fragmented and which order 
     occupies the current fragment in that sequence, respectively.  The 
     usual "byte offset" field is not used here for two reasons: a) it 
     would take one more byte and b) it does not provide any 
     information on the character offset.  UTF-8/UTF-16 text strings 
     have, in general, a variable character length ranging from 1 to 6 
     bytes.  Therefore, the TOTAL/THIS solution is preferred.  It could 
     also be argued that the LEN and SLEN fields be used for this 
     purpose, but while they would provide information about the 
     completeness of the text sample, they do not specify the order of 
     the fragments. 
    
   o Finally, the unit payload following the SLEN field consists of the 
     fragment of the UTF-8/UTF-16 encoded character string.

   This header type is used to transport either the entire modifier 
   contents present in a text sample or just the first fragment of these.  
   This depends on whether the modifier boxes fit in the current RTP 
   payload.   
    
   If a text sample is fragmented this header MUST be used to transport 
   the first fragment or the complete modifiers.

   In detail: 
    
   o The U, R, TOTAL/THIS and LEN fields are used as above.  The LEN 
     field MUST be greater than six (0x0006). 
    
   o The TOTAL/THIS field has the same meaning as for TYPE 2.  The THIS 
     field is counting the number of units (TYPE2, TYPE 3, TYPE 4) used 
     for fragmenting a text sample.  Therefore, the last (trailing) 
     modifier fragment are transported in a unit in which TOTAL=THIS.  
     In this case, TOTAL=THIS MUST be greater than one, because TOTAL 
     indicates the total number of fragments of the text sample, which 
     is logically, always larger than one.   
      
     Otherwise, if TOTAL is different from THIS in a TYPE 3 unit, this 
     unit just contains the first fragment of the modifiers. 
      
   o The SDUR has the same definition as above.  Since the fragments 
     are always transported in own RTP packets, this field is only 
     needed to know how long this fragment is valid.  E.g. the duration 
     may be used to determine how long it should be kept in the display 
     buffer.   
    
   Note that the SLEN and SIDX fields are not present.  This is because: 
   a) these fragments do not contain text strings and b) these types of 
   fragments are applied over text string fragments, which already 
   contain this information.   
    
3.1.5 TYPE 4 Header  
    
       0                   1                   2                   3

   This header type is prepended to modifier fragments, other than the 
   first one.   
    
   The U, R, TOTAL/THIS and LEN fields are used as above.  The LEN field 
   MUST be greater than six (0x0006). 
    
   Regarding the SDUR field and the absence of the SLEN and SIDX fields, 
   the same reasons as for TYPE 3 apply.

   This header type is used to transport (dynamic) sample descriptions.  
   The LEN field MUST be greater than three (0x0003).  Every sample 
   description MUST have its own TYPE 5 header. 
    
   The SIDX value is in the inclusive interval [0,127], as this unit 
   contains a dynamic sample description. 
    
   Senders MAY make use of TYPE 5 units. All receivers MUST implement 
   support for TYPE 5 units, since it adds minimum complexity and it may 
   increase the robustness of the streaming session.   
    
   Finally, if sample descriptions for a given SIDX value are not 
   available at the receiver, it is a matter of implementation whether 
   the text sample contents are displayed.  For example, an application 
   MAY provide a static default sample description to be used for these 
   cases.  This is, however, an implementation issue and out of the 
   scope of this document. 
    
    
4. Resilient Transport 
    
   Apart from the basic fragmentation guidelines described in the 
   section above, the simplest option for packet loss resilient 
   transport is repetition.   
    
   A server MAY decide to use repetition as a measure for packet loss 
   resilience.  Thereby, a server MAY send the same RTP packet payloads 
   or just parts of it, i.e. single units.   
    
   As for the case of complete payloads, single repeated units MUST 
   match exactly the same units sent in the first transmission, i.e. if 
   fragmentation is needed it SHALL be performed only once for each text 
   sample   Only then, a receiver can use the already received and the 
   repeated units to reconstruct the original text samples.  Since the 
   RTP timestamp is used to group together the fragments of a sample, 
   care must taken to preserve the timing of units when constructing new 
   RTP packets.  
    
        E.g. if a text sample was originally sent as a single non-
        fragmented text sample (one TYPE 1 unit), a repetition of that 
        sample MUST be sent also as a single non-fragmented text sample 
        in one unit.  Likewise, if the original text sample was 
        fragmented and spread over several RTP packets, say a total of 3 
        units, then the repeated fragments SHALL also have the same byte 
        boundaries and use the same unit headers and bytes per fragment.   
         
    
   With repetition, repeated units resolve to the same timestamp as 
   their originals.  Where redundant units are available, the receiver 
   SHOULD use those units received in the RTP packet with the highest 
   sequence number.   
     
   Rey & Matsui                                              [Page 24] 
   Internet Draft  RTP Payload Format for 3GPP Timed Text  July 15, 2004 
    
    
    
   Regarding the RTP header fields: 
    
   o if the whole RTP payload is repeated, all payload-specific fields 
     in the RTP header (the M, TS and PT fields) MUST keep their 
     original values except the sequence number that MUST be 
     incremented to comply with RTP.   
    
   o in packets containing single repeated units, the general rules in 
     Section 3 for assigning values to the RTP header fields apply.  
     Particularly relevant here is to keep the value of the RTP 
     timestamp to preserve the timing of the units. 
    
   Apart from repetition other mechanisms such as FEC [7], 
   retransmission [11] or similar techniques SHOULD be used to cope with 
   packet losses.   
    
    
5. Congestion control 
    
   Applications implementing this payload format SHALL implement 
   congestion control.  Congestion control for RTP SHALL be implemented 
   in accordance with RTP [3], and the applicable RTP profile, e.g. 
   RTP/AVP [17].  The RTP profile under which this payload format is 
   used defines an appropriate congestion control mechanism in different 
   environments.  Following the rules under the profile, an RTP 
   application can determine its acceptable bitrate and packet rate in 
   order to be fair to other TCP or RTP flows. 
    
    
6. Scene Description 
    
6.1 Text rendering position and composition 
    
   In order to stream timed text, either stored in a 3GP file or live, 
   some initial layout information is needed by the client to correctly 
   display the text.  These are the width, height and position of the 
   text area in the client's display and the layer or proximity of the 
   text to the user.   
    
   These pieces of information MUST be conveyed in a reliable form 
   previous to the start of the session.  An example of a reliable 
   transport may be the out-of-band channel used for SDP.  Any SDP 
   description containing a 3GPP timed text stream MUST include the 
   parameters listed above.  Section 7 and 8 provide details on the 
   usage in SDP descriptions. 
    
   For stored content, some values contained in the Track Header Box 
   SHALL be used.  See Section 12.3 for details on finding these values 
   in a 3GP file.  For live streaming appropriate values SHALL be used. 
    
6.2 SMIL usage 
    
     
   Rey & Matsui                                              [Page 25] 
   Internet Draft  RTP Payload Format for 3GPP Timed Text  July 15, 2004 
    
    
   The attributes contained in the Track Header Boxes of a 3GP file only 
   specify the spatial relationship of the tracks within the given 3GP 
   file.  If several media streams are sent, they require spatial 
   synchronization.  For such purpose, SMIL [9] SHOULD be used.   
    
   SMIL assigns regions in the display to each of those files and places 
   the tracks within those regions.  The original track header 
   information is used for each track within its region.  Therefore, 
   even if SMIL scene description is used, the track header information 
   pieces SHOULD be sent anyway as they represent the intrinsic media 
   properties.   
    
   See [1] and the 3GPP SMIL Language Profile in [16] for details. 
    
    
7. MIME Type usage Registration 
    
7.1 3GPP Timed Text MIME Registration 
    
   MIME type: video 
    
   MIME subtype: 3gpp-tt 
    
   Required parameters: 
    
   rate: the RTP timestamp clockrate is equal to the clockrate of the 
        media.  If RTP packets are generated out of a 3GP file, the 
        clockrate of the text media MUST be copied from the 3GP file, 
        i.e. the clockrate is the value of "timescale" parameter in the 
        Media Header Box describing that text track.  Other tracks 
        (audio/video/text) in the 3GP file may have their own clockrates 
        as indicated in their corresponding Media Header Box.  For live 
        encoding, a clockrate of 1000 Hz is RECOMMENDED but other values 
        MAY be used.   
    
   sver=<Z1(x1*256+y1)>, <Z2(x2*256+y2), ..., <Zi(xi*256+yi)>,... 
        The parameter "sver" specifies the list of supported backwards-
        compatible versions of the timed text format specification (3GPP 
        TS 26.245), which the sender supports (or is willing to accept).  
        The first value is the current value used or the preferred 
        value.  This MAY be followed by a comma-separated list of 
        increasingly older versions that SHOULD be used as alternatives.  
        The order is meaningful, being first most preferred and last 
        least preferred.  Regarding the value calculation: "Zi" is the 
        number of the Release, "xi" and "yi" are taken from the 3GPP 
        specification version, i.e. vZi.xi.yi.  For example, for 3GPP TS 
        26.245 v6.0.0, Zi(xi*256+yi)=6(0), the version value is "60".  
        Note that "60" is the concatenation of the values Zi=6 and 
        (xi*256+yi)=0 and not its product.   
         
   width=<integer-value>, indicates the width in pixels of the text 
        track or area where the text is actually displayed.  This is a 
        16 bit integer.

   height=<integer-value>, indicates the height in pixels of the text 
        track.  This is a 16 bit integer. 
         
   tx=<integer-value>, indicates the horizontal translation offset in 
        pixels of the text track with respect to the origin of the video 
         track.  This is a 16 bit integer. 
        . 
   ty=<integer-value>, indicates the vertical translation offset in 
        pixels of the text track.  This is a 16 bit integer. 
         
   layer=<integer-value>, indicates the proximity of the text track to 
        the viewer.  Higher values means closer to the viewer.  This 
        parameter has no units.  This is a 16 bit integer. 
         
   Optional parameters: 
    
   spldesc=<value> indicates the way the server sends the sample 
        descriptions.  This parameter MAY not be present, this meaning 
        that the value "both" is used.  In detail: 
         
        o "out": all sample descriptions are sent out-of-band, e.g. in 
           the SDP.  This may be used when the total number of sample 
           descriptions used is low.  This is useful, e.g., for those 
           clients that want to choose a simple text stream.   
            
        o "both":, where both, in- and out-of-band, mechanisms MAY be 
           used.  Note that "spldesc=both" indicates that both in-band 
           and out-of-band sample descriptions MAY be sent for that 
           stream,  and not that both are necessarily sent during a 
           session.  This corresponds to the default case.  This is the 
           default case.   
         
   tx3g=<base64-value-1>, <base64-value-2>,...This parameter MUST be 
        used for conveying sample descriptions out-of-band.  The list of 
        sample entries MAY follow any particular order and it MAY be 
        empty.  The absence of this parameter is equivalent to an empty 
        list of sample descriptions.  The <base64-value-i> represents 
        the base64 encoding of the concatenation of the SIDX and the 
        sample description for that SIDX, in this order.  The format of 
        a sample description entry can be found in 3GPP TS 26.245 
        Release 6 and later releases.  All servers and clients MUST 
        understand this parameter and MUST be capable of using the 
        sample description(s) contained in it.  Please refer to RFC 3548 
        [6] for details on the base64 encoding. 
    
   brand=<brand-name>, where <brand-name> indicates the "best use" of 
        the original 3GP file from which the timed text contents are 
        read.   
         
   cbrand=<brand-name-1>,<brand-name-2>,..."Compatible brands" contains 
        a list of compatible brands for the 3GP file..

   mver=<version-value>, "Minor version" where <version-value> is a 
        positive integer.  It identifies the version of the 
        specification of the file brand. 
         
        Note that the parameters "brand", "cbrand", and "mver" are  
        merely informational, as they only provide information about the 
        original 3GP file being read from.  Details on these parameters 
        can be found in the 3GP file format section of 3GPP TS 26.234 
        Release 5 specification and corresponding specifications in 
        later Releases. 
         
   Encoding considerations: this type is only defined for transfer via 
   RTP. 
    
   Security considerations: please refer to Section 10 of RFCXXXX. 
    
   Interoperability considerations: the 3GPP Timed Text media format for 
   which this payload format is defined is specified in Release 6 of 
   3GPP TS 26.245 "Transparent end-to-end packet switched streaming 
   service (PSS); Timed Text Format (Release 6)".  The 3GPP file format 
   (3GP) referred to in this document and the used SMIL language profile 
   can be found in Release 5 of 3GPP TS 26.234 and in the corresponding 
   specifications for later Releases.  Note also that 3GPP may in future 
   Releases specify extensions or updates to the media format in a 
   backwards-compatible way, e.g. new modifier boxes or extensions to 
   the sample descriptions.  The payload format defined in RFCXXXX 
   allows for such extensions.  For future 3GPP Releases of the Timed 
   Text Format, the parameter "sver" is used to identify the exact 
   specification used.

8. SDP usage 
    
8.1 Mapping to SDP 
    
   The information carried in the MIME media type specification has a 
   specific mapping to fields in SDP [4].  If SDP is used to specify 
   sessions using this payload format, the mapping is done as follows: 
    
   o The MIME type ("video") goes in the SDP "m=" as the media name.  
     The "video" MIME Type is used as timed text is considered visual 
     media. 
    
       m=video <port number> RTP/<RTP profile> <dynamic payload type> 
    
   o The MIME subtype ("3gpp-tt") and the timestamp rate go in SDP 
     "a=rtpmap" line as the encoding name and (clock) rate, 
     respectively: 
    
       a=rtpmap:<payload type> 3gpp-tt/<rate> 
    
   o The MANDATORY fmtp parameters "sver", "width", "height", "tx", 
     "ty" and "layer" go in the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute by copying them 
     directly from the MIME media type string as a semicolon separated 
     list of parameter=value pairs. 
    
   o The OPTIONAL parameters "spldesc", "tx3g", "brand", "cbrand" and 
     "mver" go in the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute by copying them directly 
     from the MIME media type string as a semicolon separated list of 
     parameter=value pairs (note that some parameters MAY need to 
     specify a list of values, e.g. "tx3g"):

8.2 Parameter Usage in the SDP Offer/Answer Model 
    
   In this section the meaning of the SDP parameters defined in this 
   document within the Offer/Answer (O/A) [13] context is explained.

   In unicast, sender and receiver typically negotiate the streams, i.e. 
   which codecs and parameter values are used in the session.  This is 
   also possible in multicast to a lesser extend.  
    
   As stated in the O/A model, some "fmtp" (payload-format-specific) 
   parameters have a clear meaning and shall be included in the answer 
   as present in the offer.  Other parameters may need to be set among 
   parties, because it is not clear that offerer and answerer shall use 
   the same values.   
    
   These considerations apply to both 3GP file streaming and live 
   streaming scenarios. 
    
8.2.1 Unicast 
    
   The clock rate parameter "rate" in the offered MUST be included 
   verbatim in the answer or else the stream MUST be removed or the 
   session MUST be rejected. 
    
   The parameters "tx", "ty", "layer", "height", "width", "tx3g", 
   "brand", "cbrand" and "mver" are declarative parameters.  This means 
   that an offerer using these parameters only specifies which values 
   are going to be used for the sent stream or which values the offerer 
   prefers or is able to support for the received stream (recvonly or 
   sendrecv streams).  Offerer and answerer MAY use different values; 
   thereby an answerer MAY include these parameters in the answerer or 
   not.  If included, these values MAY be the same values or different.  
   Upon receiving the answer, an offerer MUST be prepared to receive a 
   stream with the values signalled in the answer, in the case of 
   recvonly or sendrecv streams. 
    
   The "spldesc" parameter is used to express an explicit preference (or 
   setting) of the offerer for the timed text stream to be received (or 
   sent): the text stream uses either a reduced number of out-of-band 
   sample descriptions or it MAY use both in- out-of-band.  Therefore, 
   if present, it MUST be used symmetrically, i.e. included verbatim in 
   the answer.  Otherwise the stream MUST be removed or the session 
   rejected.   
    
   The timed text media format version of the stream (3GPP 
   specification) MUST be negotiated.  This is accomplished with the 
   "sver" parameter and it is negotiated as follows:   
    
     For streams set to sendonly or sendrecv, the answerer MAY downgrade 
     the "sver" parameter list by deleting version values, starting  
     with the newer versions (first values).  An answerer MUST NOT add 
     new values to this list.  Upon receiving the answer, the offerer 
     MUST accordingly downgrade the stream, e.g. by not sending newer 
     extensions.  For sendrecv streams, the offerer MUST additionally be 
     prepared to receive a stream according to the version signalled by 
     the answerer.   
    

     
   Rey & Matsui                                              [Page 30] 
   Internet Draft  RTP Payload Format for 3GPP Timed Text  July 15, 2004 
    
    
     For streams set to recvonly, the answerer MAY similarly modify the 
     "sver" parameter.  Upon receiving the answer, the offerer MUST be 
     ready to receive the stream in the signalled version as set by the 
     answerer. 
    
   In order to avoid failed negotiations it is RECOMMENDED for the 
   offerer to include an exhaustive list of versions it supports.  On 
   the other hand, since answerers MUST NOT add new values to the "sver" 
   list, an offerer MAY intentionally restrict the version it wishes to 
   receive or send by listing only the desired versions in the offer.  
   I.e. either the answerer supports that particular version or it MUST 
   remove the stream (or reject the session). 
    
8.2.2 Multicast 
    
   In this case all parameters MUST be used symmetrically in order for 
   all participants to have the same vision of the multicast session.  
   Otherwise the stream MUST be removed or the session MUST be rejected. 
    
8.3 Parameter Usage outside of Offer/Answer 
 
   SDP may also be employed outside of the Offer/Answer context, for 
   instance for multimedia sessions that are announced through the 
   Session Announcement Protocol (SAP) [14], or streamed through the 
   Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) [15].   
    
   In this case, the receiver of a session description MUST support the 
   parameters and given values for the streams or else it MUST reject 
   the session.  It is the responsibility of the sender of the session 
   descriptions to define the session parameters so that the probability 
   of unsuccessful session setup is minimized.  This is out of the scope 
   of this document. 
    
    
9. IANA Considerations 
    
   IANA is requested to register the MIME subtype name "3gpp-tt" for the 
   media type "video" as specified in Section 7 of this document.   
    
    
10. Security considerations 
    
   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification 
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP 
   specification [3].   
    
   In particular, an attacker may invalidate the current set of valid 
   sample descriptions at the client by means of repeating a packet with 
   an old sample description, i.e. replay attack.  This would mean that 
   the display of the text would be corrupted, if displayed at all.  
   Another form of attack may consist in sending redundant fragments, 
   whose boundaries do not match the exact boundaries of the originals.  
   This may cause a decoder to crash. 
     
   Rey & Matsui                                              [Page 31] 
   Internet Draft  RTP Payload Format for 3GPP Timed Text  July 15, 2004 
    
    
    
   These types of attack may easily be avoided by using source 
   authentication and integrity protection.   
    
   Additionally, peers in a timed text session may desire to retain 
   privacy in their communication, i.e. confidentiality.   
    
   This payload format does not provide any mechanisms for achieving 
   these.  Confidentiality, integrity protection and authentication have 
   to be solved by a mechanism external to this payload format, e.g. 
   SRTP [10].

12. Annexes  
    
12.1 Dynamic SIDX wraparound mechanism 
    
   Senders using dynamic sample descriptions MUST implement this 
   mechanism.  Receivers MUST always implement it. 
    
   As mentioned in Section 3.1.2, dynamic SIDX values remain active 
   either during the entire duration of the session (if used just once) 
   or in different intervals of it (if used once or more).  Although 64 
   sample descriptions should cover the needs of most timed text 
   applications, a wraparound mechanism to handle the exception is 
   described here.  In the following, SIDX value means dynamic SIDX 
   value. 
    
   There is a sliding window of 64 active SIDX values.  Values within 
   the window are active, all others are considered inactive.  An SIDX 
   value becomes "active" if at least one sample description identified 
   by that SIDX has been received.  Since sample descriptions MAY be 
   sent redundantly, it is possible that a client receives a given SIDX 
   several times.  However, the receiver SHALL ignore redundant sample 
   descriptions and it MUST use the already cached copy.  The guard 
   range of inactive values ensures that always the correct association 
   SIDX <-> sample description is used. 
     
   Rey & Matsui                                              [Page 33] 
   Internet Draft  RTP Payload Format for 3GPP Timed Text  July 15, 2004 
    
    
    
   The following algorithm is used to maintain the dynamic SIDX values: 
    
     Let X be the SIDX of the last received sample description.  Let Y  
     be a value within the allowed range for dynamic SIDX: [0,127], and  
     different from X. 
    
        1. Initialize all dynamic SIDX values as inactive.  For stored 
          content, read the sample description index in the Sample to 
          Chunk box ("stsc") for that sample.  For live streaming, the 
          first value MAY be zero or any other value in the interval 
          above.  The initial value is SIDX=X.  Go to step 2. 
        2. First in-band sample description with SIDX=X is received. Go 
          to step 3. 
        3. Set all SIDX=Y inactive if inside the interval [X+1 
          modulo(128), X+64 modulo(128)].  Otherwise, set SIDX=Y as 
          active.  Go to step 4. 
        4. Wait for next sample description.  Upon reception of a sample 
          description with SIDX=X do:  
             a. If X is currently active, then wait for next SIDX (do 
               nothing).   
             b. Else go to step 3. 
      
   Example,  
    
        if X=4, any SIDX in the interval [5,68] is inactive.  Active 
        SIDX values are in the complementary interval [69,127] plus 
        [0,4].  Once the client is initialized, the interval of active 
        SIDX values MUST change whenever a sample description with an 
        inactive SIDX value is received.  E.g., if the client receives a 
        SIDX=6, then the active interval is now different: [0,6] plus 
        [71,127].  However, if the received SIDX is in the current valid 
        interval no change SHALL be applied.  This means that at any 
        instant a maximum of 64 SIDX values are valid, whereas the total 
        of values used might be over 64.   
    
12.2 Basics of the 3GP File Structure 
    
   This section provides a coarse overview of the 3GP file structure. 
    
   Each 3GP file consists of "Boxes".  Boxes start with a header, which 
   indicates both size and type contained.  In general, a 3GP file 
   contains the File Type Box (ftyp), the Movie Box (moov), and the 
   Media Data Box (mdat).  The Movie Box and the Media Data Box, serving 
   as containers, include own boxes for each media.  Similarly, each box 
   type may include a number of boxes.  See ISO Base Media file Format 
   [2] for a complete list of possibilities. 
    
   In the following, only those boxes are mentioned, which are useful 
   for the purposes of this payload format. 
    
   The File Type Box identifies the type and properties of a 3GP file.  
   The File Type Box contents comprise the major brand, the minor 
     
   Rey & Matsui                                              [Page 34] 
   Internet Draft  RTP Payload Format for 3GPP Timed Text  July 15, 2004 
    
    
   version and the compatible brands.  When streamed with RTP, these are 
   communicated via out-of-band means, such as SDP.   
    
   The Movie Box (moov) contains one or more Track Boxes (trak) which 
   include information about each track.  A Track Box contains, among 
   others, the Track Header Box (tkhd), the Media Header Box (mdhd) and 
   the Media Information Box (minf).   
    
   The Track Header Box specifies the characteristics of a single track, 
   where a track is, in this case, the streamed text during a session.  
   Exactly one Track Header Box is present for a track.  It contains 
   information about the track, such as the spatial layout (width and 
   height), the video transformation matrix and the layer number.  Since 
   these pieces of information are essential and static, i.e. constant 
   for the duration of the session, they MUST be sent prior to the 
   transmission of any text samples.  See the ISO base media file format 
   [2] for details about the definition of the conveyed information. 
    
   The Media Header Box contains the timescale or number of time units 
   that pass in one second, i.e. cycles per second or Hertz.  The Media 
   Information Box includes the Sample Table Box (stbl) which itself 
   contains the Sample Description Box (stsd), the Decoding Time to 
   Sample Box (stts), the Sample Size Box (stsz) and the Sample to Chunk 
   Box (stsc).  Sample descriptions for each text sample are encoded as 
   "tx3g" sample entries in the Sample Description Box (stsd).  
    
   The Sample Table Box (stbl) contains all the time and data indexing 
   of the media samples in a track.  Using the tables here, it is 
   possible to locate samples in time, determine their type, and 
   determine their size, container, and offset into that container.   
    
   Finally, the Media Data Box contains the media data itself.  In timed 
   text tracks this box contains text samples.  Its equivalent to audio 
   and video is audio and video frames, respectively.  The text sample 
   consists of the text length, the text string, and one or several 
   Modifier Boxes.  The text length is the size of the text in bytes.  
   The text string is plain text to render.  The Modifier Box is 
   information to render in addition to the text such as colour, font, 
   etc. 
    
12.3 Usage of 3GP file information for transport in RTP 
    
   For the purpose of streaming timed text contents, some values in the 
   boxes contained in a 3GP file are mapped to fields of this payload 
   header.  This section explains where to find and how to use those 
   values. 
    
   From the Track Header Box (tkhd): 
    
        o tx,ty: these values are the second but last and third but 
          last values in the unity matrix.  These values are fixed-
          point 16.16 values, restricted to be integers (the lower 16 

     
   Rey & Matsui                                              [Page 35] 
   Internet Draft  RTP Payload Format for 3GPP Timed Text  July 15, 2004 
    
    
          bits of each value shall be zero). Therefore, only the first 
          16 bits are used. 
         
        o width, height: they also have the same name in the box and 
          the payload header.  Similarly as above, only the first 16 
          bits are used, the rest is zero. 
         
        o layer: all 16 bits are used.  
    
   From the Sample Table Box (stbl) the following information is carried 
   in each RTP packet using this payload format:  
    
        o the Sample Description Box (stsd): this stsd box provides 
          information on the basic characteristics of text samples.  
          Each entry is a sample entry box of type "tx3g".  An example 
          of the information contained in a sample entry could be the 
          font size or the background color.  These pieces of 
          information are commonly used by many text samples during the 
          session.  Each sample entry "tx3g" is transported either in-
          band or out-of-band. 
         
        o the Decoding Time to Sample Box (stts): the 24 least 
          significant bits of the "sample_delta" are mapped to the 
          field SDUR (Text Sample Duration), 
         
        o the Sample Size Box (stsz): the 16 least significant bits of 
          the "sample_size" or "entry_size" (depending on whether the 
          sample size is fixed or variable) indicate the length (in 
          bytes) of the text string plus any modifier boxes that may be 
          in that text sample.  This value includes the text string 
          length and, if present, the byte order mark.  Therefore it 
          MUST be accordingly adjusted to exclude those, i.e. 2 or 4 
          units SHALL be subtracted for UTF-8 encoded samples and UTF-
          16 encoded samples, respectively.  The resulting value MUST 
          be directly mapped to the SLEN field defined in the TYPE 2 
          header.  At the receiver, the reverse operation MUST be done 
          to re-assemble the text string and obtain the length of the 
          sample as stored in the 3GP file. 
         
        o the Sample to Chunk Box (stsc): the value of the 
          "sample_description_index" for that sample in the Sample to 
          Chunk Box is mapped to the field SIDX (Text Sample Entry 
          Index).  The Sample to Chunk Box (stsc) associates the text 
          sample and its corresponding sample description entry in the 
          Sample Description Box (stsd, see below).  The Sample to 
          Chunk Box can be used to associate a text sample with a 
          sample description entry.  Since the sample description may 
          vary during the session, the association SDIX is sent 
          together with the text samples using this payload format.
