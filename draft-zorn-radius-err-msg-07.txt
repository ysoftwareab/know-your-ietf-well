Internet-Draft            RADIUS Error Messages               April 2007


1.  Introduction

   The RADIUS protocol [RFC2865] is defined to allow most errors to be
   ignored and to silently discard unrecognized or erroneous packets.
   In many cases, this behavior is beneficial or at least innocuous.
   For example, it's probably a good idea to discard messages from
   unknown clients and server messages having incorrect authenticators,
   and discarding short packets doesn't seem to hurt anything.  In some
   cases, however, this policy can cause interoperability problems and
   may result in the provision of incorrect services to users,
   particularly in roaming situations.

   Because RADIUS packets having unknown values in the Code field of the
   header are silently discarded it is difficult to ascertain whether a
   new packet type is considered invalid by the remote client/server or
   if the message was simply lost.  Similarly, RFC 2865 allows clients
   to ignore unrecognized attributes, which can lead to incorrect
   service provisioning.

   This document defines a set of messages and attributes that can be
   used to notify a RADIUS client or server of various message errors.

   Discussion of this draft may be directed to the author.


2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  RADIUS Packet Format

   Exactly one RADIUS packet is encapsulated in the UDP Data field
   [RFC0768] where the UDP Destination Port field indicates 1812
   (decimal).

   When a reply is generated, the source and destination ports are
   reversed.

   A summary of the RADIUS data format is shown below.  The fields are
   transmitted from left to right.

      Code

         The Code field is one octet, and identifies the type of RADIUS
         packet.  When a client receives a packet with an invalid Code
         field, it is silently discarded.  If a server receives a packet
         with an invalid Code field from a valid client, it SHOULD reply
         with an Error-Notification packet (section 4.1); if the server
         does not support the Error Notification packet, it MUST
         silently discard the received packet.

         The RADIUS Codes (decimal) defined in this document are as
         follows:

            <MSG1> Error-Notification

      Identifier

         The Identifier field is one octet, and aids in matching
         requests, replies and notifications.  The RADIUS server can
         detect a duplicate request if it has the same client source IP
         address, source UDP port and Identifier within a short span of
         time.

      Length

         The Length field is two octets.  It indicates the length of the
         packet including the Code, Identifier, Length, Authenticator
         and Attribute fields.  Octets outside the range of the Length
         field MUST be treated as padding and ignored on reception.  If
         the packet is shorter than the Length field indicates, it MUST
         be silently discarded.  The minimum length is 20 and maximum
         length is 4096.

      Authenticator

         The Authenticator field is sixteen (16) octets.  The most
         significant octet is transmitted first.  This value is used to
         authenticate the reply from the RADIUS server.

         Notification Authenticator

            The value of the Authenticator field in the Error-
            Notification packet is called the Notification
            Authenticator, and contains a one-way MD5 hash calculated
            over a stream of octets consisting of: the RADIUS packet,
            beginning with the Code field, including the Identifier, the
            Length, the Authenticator field from the packet to which
            this packet is a response, and the response Attributes,
            followed by the shared secret.  That is,

            Notification Auth =
                      MD5(Code+ID+Length+RequestAuth+Attributes+Secret)
            where '+' denotes concatenation.

      Administrative Note

         The secret shared between the client and the RADIUS server
         SHOULD be at least as large and unguessable as a well-chosen
         password.  It is preferred that the secret be at least 16
         octets.  This is to ensure a sufficiently large range for the
         secret to provide protection against exhaustive search attacks.
         The secret MUST NOT be empty (length 0) since this would allow
         packets to be trivially forged.

         A RADIUS server MUST use the source IP address of the RADIUS
         UDP packet to decide which shared secret to use, so that RADIUS
         requests can be proxied.

         When using a forwarding proxy, the proxy must be able to alter
         the packet as it passes through in each direction - when the
         proxy forwards the request, the proxy MAY add a Proxy-State
         Attribute, and when the proxy forwards a response, it MUST
         remove its Proxy-State Attribute if it added one.  Proxy-State
         is always added or removed after any other Proxy-States, but no
         other assumptions regarding its location within the list of
         attributes can be made.  Since Access-Accept and Access-Reject
         replies are authenticated on the entire packet contents, the
         stripping of the Proxy-State attribute invalidates the
         signature in the packet - so the proxy has to re-sign it.

         Further details of RADIUS proxy implementation are outside the

         scope of this document.


4.  Packet Types

   The RADIUS Packet type is determined by the Code field in the first
   octet of the Packet.

4.1.  Error-Notification

   Description

      Error-Notification packets are sent by a RADIUS server as an
      indication that a previous request contained one or more errors.
      A RADIUS server wishing to notify a client that one or more errors
      occurred MUST transmit a RADIUS packet with the Code field set to
      <MSG1> (Error-Notification).

      Error-Notification packets MUST contain at least one Error-Code
      Attribute.

      A summary of the Error-Notification packet format is shown below.
      The fields are transmitted from left to right.

         created.

      Notification Authenticator

         The Notification Authenticator value is calculated from the
         Error-Notification packet, as described above.

      Attributes

         The Attribute field is variable in length, and contains any
         desired optional Attributes in addition to the required
         Attributes.


5.  Attributes

5.1.  Error-Code

   Description

      This attribute contains a code identifying the class of error that
      occurred, a code signifying the error itself and an optional text
      description of the error.

      The Error-Code Attribute MUST be included in Error-Notification
      packets sent from a server.

      RADIUS Accounting [RFC2866] clients MUST include this Attribute in
      Accounting-Request packets in which the Acct-Status-Type Attribute
      has a value of Acct-Error-Notification (see below).

      A summary of the Error-Code Attribute format is shown below.  The
      fields are transmitted from left to right.

      Type

         <ATR> for Error-Code.

      Length

         >= 4

      Class

         The CLASS field contains a single ASCII character indicating
         the severity of the error.  This document defines the following
         error classes:

         F  The error was fatal and the message causing the error was
            discarded.

         W  Warning error: the message was processed, but the result may
            not be as anticipated.

      Code

         The Code field contains an unsigned integer representing the
         type of error that occurred.  This document defines the
         following decimal values for the Code field:

         1  Unrecognized Packet Type

         2  Unrecognized Vendor OUI

         3  Unrecognized Attribute

         4  Unknown Session Identifier

         5  Unknown Key Identifier

      String

         The optional String field contains a text description of the
         error.  When the Error-Code Attribute is used in Accounting-
         Request packets, the String field SHOULD contain a message
         describing the error.


6.  Attribute Values

   The following sub-sections defines a new value for the Acct-Status-
   Type Attribute [RFC2866].

6.1.  Acct-Error-Notification

   Description

      When the value <VAL> is present in the Value field of an Acct-
      Status-Type Attribute in an Accounting-Request packet, it
      signifies that one or more errors have occurred on the client
      side.


7.  IANA Considerations

   The criteria to be used by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
   (IANA) for assignment of numbers within namespaces defined within
   this document are identical to those given in [RFC3575].


8.  Security Considerations

   None.
