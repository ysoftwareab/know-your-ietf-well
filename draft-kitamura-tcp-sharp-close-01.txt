   "Sharp Close": Elimination of TIME-WAIT state of TCP connections
               <draft-kitamura-tcp-sharp-close-01.txt>

Abstract

   This document describes an idea "Sharp Close" that eliminates or
   minimizes TIME-WAIT state of TCP connections.

   In the current TCP specification ([RFC0793]), there are some
   inappropriate or not up to date functions. Here we focus and
   discuss on TCP TIME-WAIT state function.

   TIME-WAIT is the last state of TCP connection of Active Close side
   node.  After TCP connections are effectively closed, they move to
   TIME-WAIT state. After TIME-WAIT state is finished, resources of
   connections are released. This means that even if connections are
   effectively finished, resources of connections are NOT released.
   The TIME-WAIT state prevents from releasing them.

   From the viewpoints of current high-speed and high-multiplicity
   communication styles, it is thought that TIME-WAIT state is one of
   evil functions.

   In order to provide efficient communication that matches current
   styles, an idea "Sharp Close" that eliminates or minimizes TIME-
   WAIT state of TCP connections is proposed.

1. Introduction

   This document describes an idea "Sharp Close" that eliminates or
   minimizes TIME-WAIT state of TCP connections.

   In the current TCP specification ([RFC0793]), there are some
   inappropriate or not up to date functions. Here we focus and
   discuss on TCP TIME-WAIT state function.

   TIME-WAIT is the last state of TCP connection of Active Close side
   node.  After TCP connections are effectively closed, they move to
   last TIME-WAIT state. [RFC0793] defines that the connections stay
   there 2MSL(Maximum Segment Lifetime) seconds. (2MSL = 240 sec.)

Internet Draft     Sharp Close


   After TIME-WAIT state is finished, resources of connections are
   released. This means that even if connections are effectively
   finished, resources of connections are NOT released. The TIME-WAIT
   state prevents from releasing them.

   From the viewpoints of current high-speed and high-multiplicity
   communication styles that require highly resource recycling, it is
   thought that TIME-WAIT state is one of evil functions.

   In order to provide efficient communication that matches current
   styles, an idea "Sharp Close" that eliminates or minimizes TIME-
   WAIT state of TCP connections is proposed.

   In the following sections, analysis of current TIME-WAIT state and
   design of "Sharp Close" etc. are described.

   Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 show Close Sequence that is defined by current
   specification [RFC0793]. TCP connections on ACTIVE CLOSE node (that
   initiates sending FIN) side reach TIME-WAIT as a last state. They
   wait there 2MSL seconds.

Internet Draft     Sharp Close


   Table 1 shows actual 2MSL values that are surveyed by authors.

   [RFC0793] says "For this specification the MSL is taken to be 2
   minutes."

   Since 240 sec. ([RFC0793]) is long time, recent major OSes adopt
   rather shorter time.

   However, from the viewpoints of current communication styles that
   require highly resource recycling, TIME-WAIT time is still too
   long.

   Now, it is almost thought that staying at TIME-WAIT state is waste
   of time.

3. Why TIME-WAIT state is needed?

   Basically, TIME-WAIT state is designed for !fail-safe! purpose.

   If it is assumed that packets transferring order is not changed,
   all of !data! packets from a corresponding node are received when
   FIN-WAIT-2 state is finished (responding FIN packet is received)
   and no !data! packets will not be received after that.

   At TIME-WAIT state, an ACTIVE CLOSE node waits for a 'resending'
   !control! packet FIN only from the corresponding node for the case
   of the sent ACK (for the FIN) is lost. (No !data! packets are
   waited for.)

   Only when the last sent ACK from the ACTIVE CLOSE node is lost,

   It is rare case to happen this event at current stable network
   environment.

   Since all data from the corresponding node is received by the
   ACTIVE CLOSE node, it is less significant issue to wait for
   'resending' FIN packet.

   If 'resending' FIN is NOT waited at ACTIVE CLOSE node and
   'resending' FIN is issued from the corresponding node, significant
   problem will NOT be happened, only RST packet (to notify receiving
   unexpected packet) will be issued from the ACTIVE CLOSE node.

Internet Draft     Sharp Close


   It is easy to design "Sharp Close" function. "Sharp Close" function
   is achieved by eliminating or minimizing TIME-WAIT state of TCP
   connections.

   Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. show Close Sequence that is defined by "Sharp
   Close" function.


5. Eliminate TIME-WAIT state by setsockopt()

   Under current implementation, TIME-WAIT (close()) action can be
   controlled by setsockopt() function.

   SO_LINGER option of setsockopt() can eliminate TIME-WAIT state and
   close connections immediately.


    Concrete procedures how to eliminate TIME-WAIT:

   Fig. 5 shows struct socket in <sys/socket.h>

         struct linger {
                int l_onoff;    /* linger active */
                int l_linger;   /* how many seconds to linger for */
         };

   Fig. 5. struct linger

    1. makes linger active(on)
        l_onoff = on;

    2, sets linger time to 0
        l_linger = 0 ;

   With above shown procedure, TIME-WAIT state is eliminated and
   connections are closed immediately.

   It is possible to eliminate TIME-WAIT state.  However, this
   behavior is "NOT default" operation. In order to utilize this
   feature, it is necessary to modify huge number of communication
   applications.

   Furthermore, this feature is not implemented on every existing OSes
   and it is not always possible to eliminate TIME-WAIT state on every
   OSes.

6. Security Considerations

   Goals of the proposed idea ("Sharp Close") are to eliminate or
   minimize TIME-WAIT state by default on OS kernel level. From
   functional viewpoints, the same concept to eliminate TIME-WAIT
   state is already implemented by using LINGER option of setsockopt()
   function. It is not default operation, however it is already
   worked.

   So, there are no new Security Consideration issues that should be
   discussed here.

7. IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any resource assignments to IANA.
