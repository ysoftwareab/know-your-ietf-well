   encoded and multiplexed data transport over the Internet. 
   Additionally, the use of RTP makes it possible to synchronize 
   MPEG-4 data with other real-time data types. 
   This specification is a product of the Audio/Video Transport 
   working group within the Internet Engineering Task Force and 
   ISO/IEC MPEG-4 ad hoc group on MPEG-4 over Internet. Comments

Internet Draft  RTP payload for MPEG-4 FlexMux streams     November 01 
    
   1     Introduction 
 
      The MPEG-4 standard (ISO/IEC 14496) can be represented in a 
      layered architecture, where three layers can be identified as 
      follows: 
                       +---------------------------------------+ 
         media aware,  |           COMPRESSION LAYER:          | 
                       |     Elementary Streams (ES) encoding  |

                       +---------------------------------------+ 
      ================================================ ESI Interface 
                       +---------------------------------------+ 
          media and    |         SYNC LAYER (SL)               | 
       delivery unaware|      Elementary streams management    | 
            layer      |         and synchronisation           | 
                       +---------------------------------------+ 
       ================================================DAI Interface 
                       +---------------------------------------+ 
       delivery aware, |          DELIVERY LAYER (DMIF)        | 
       media  unaware  |provides Flexmultiplexing of SL streams| 
            layer      |        and transparent access         | 
                       |      to the delivery technology       | 
                       +---------------------------------------+ 
      Although the Delivery Layer mostly focuses on the control plane 
      it also encompasses  multiplexing tools, called the Flexmux 
      tools, to multiplex MPEG-4 SL streams. MPEG makes the assumption 
      that each MPEG-4 packet transmitted over the network should have 
      a nearly constant transmission delay. Under this assumption, the 
      reconstruction of the correct timing of MPEG-4 bitstreams is 
      supported both by the MPEG-4 SL stream syntax and by the MPEG-4 
      FlexMux stream syntax. The reconstruction of the correct timing  
      of an MPEG-4 Flexmux stream is possible under various QoS  
      constraints related to the reduction of network jitter.  
       
      One payload format has been defined to carry MPEG-4 Audio and 
      Video Elementary streams [7], or are under definition to carry 
      MPEG-4 SL streams [14] & [15]. 
      This document will specify a RTP payload format to enable the 
      carriage of Flexmux streams. It is inline with the MPEG-4  
      delivery Framework [9]. 
   2     MPEG-4 overview 
   2.1  Compresion layer: 
    
     The compressed content produced by this layer are the Elementary  
      Streams (ESs)that are organised in Access Units (AUs). An AU is 
      the smallest element to which timestamps can be assigned.

Internet Draft  RTP payload for MPEG-4 FlexMux streams     November 01 
      
     AUs are passed to the Synchronisation Layer (SL) together with 
     timestamps, RandomAccess, and other information through the ESI 
     interface. 
      
      The Compression Layer processes the traditional individual 
      audio/visual elementary streams (ES) and some associated 
      'systems' elementary streams (ES) such as Bifs, OD, IPMP and 
      OCI elementary streams. 
    
      The MPEG-4 audio/visual ES syntaxes are defined in[3] and[2]. 
      The 'systems' ES syntaxes are described in [1]: the Bifs ES 
      syntax allows a dynamic scene description. The OD ES syntax 
      allows the description of the hierarchical relations, location 
      and properties of different ESs through a dynamic set of Object 
      Descriptors. The 'system' ES may require to be carried with a 
      better protection than the traditional audio/visual ESs. 
    
      The compression layer is unaware of a specific delivery 
      technology, but it can react to the characteristics of a  
      particular delivery layer such as the path-MTU or packet loss or  
      bit error characteristics. 
 
   2.2     Synchronisation Layer: 
    
      The MPEG-4 SL stream syntax is defined in [1]. It provides a 
      unique and homogeneous encapsulation of any ES which is 
      organised in AUs. This the case of all the MPEG-4 ESs, but it can 
      also be the case of non MPEG-4 ESs. 
      That layer primarily provides the synchronisation between ESs. 
      Integer or fractional AUs, from the same ES, are encapsulated in  
      SL packets  that build an SL stream. 
 
     SL packets are passed to the Delivery Layer (DMIF) through the 
     DMIF Application Interface (DAI interface), which can allows 
     assigning  QoS requirements to the delivery of SL streams. 
      
      The compression layer is unaware of a specific delivery 
      technology, but it can react to the characteristics of a  
      particular delivery layer such as the path-MTU or packet loss. 
    
    
   2.3  Delivery Layer: 
    
      The MPEG-4 Delivery Layer consists of the Delivery Multimedia 
      Integration Framework defined in [4]. This layer is media 
      unaware but delivery technology aware. It provides transparent 
      access to and delivery of content irrespective of the 
      technologies used.

Internet Draft  RTP payload for MPEG-4 FlexMux streams     November 01 
    
      This interface supports content location independent protocols 
      firstly for establishing the MPEG-4 session and secondly for 
      accessing to transport channels. DMIF monitors transport 
      channels on the QoS requirements assigned to the SL streams, 
      and supports the multiplexing of the SL streams, by the means 
      of the MPEG-4 FlexMux tools. There are different possible FlexMux 
      tools. FlexMux streams delivery is defined in [4], while the 
      FlexMux stream syntax is defined within [1]. 
    
    
      MPEG makes the assumption that the carriage of MPEG-4 Flexmux 
      streams over the network should affect packets with an 'ideal' 
      constant transmission delay; the reconstruction of the correct 
      timing of a MPEG-4 Flexmux streams is based on that assumption. 
      
      This draft specifies an RTP [5] payload format for transporting 
      multiplexed MPEG-4 encoded data streams. It can be presented as 
      an instance of the MPEG-4 Delivery layer. 
 
   3     Benefits of using RTP for transport: 
    
        i. Ability to synchronize MPEG-4 streams with other RTP 
           payloads 
    
        ii. Monitoring MPEG-4 delivery performance through RTCP 
    
        iii. Combining MPEG-4 and other real-time data streams 
             received from multiple end-systems into a set of 
             consolidated streams through RTP mixers 
    
        iv. Converting data types, etc. through the use of RTP 
            translators

   5.2  RTP header fields usage streams: 
    
      Payload Type (PT): The assignment of a particular  RTP payload 
      type to this new packet format, is outside the scope of this 
      document, and is not specified here. If the dynamic payload 
      type assignment is used, it can be specified by some out of 
      band means (e.g. SDP, according to the syntax proposed in the 
      paragraph 9) that the MPEG-4 FlexMux payload format 
      is used for the corresponding RTP packets.  
    
      Marker (M) bit: The M bit is set to 1 to indicate that the RTP 
      packet payload includes the end of each Access Unit of which data 
      is contained in this RTP packet.  
      The M bit is set to 0 when the RTP packet contains one or more 
      Access Unit fragments that are not Access Unit ends.  
    
       
      Extension (X) bit: Defined by the RTP profile used. 
    
      Sequence Number: Increment by one for each RTP data packet sent. 
      It starts with a random initial value for security reasons.

      Timestamp: it represents the target transmission time for the 
      first byte of the RTP packet. Unless specified by an out of 
      band means (e.g. SDP), the resolution of the timestamp is set 
      to its default (90KHz). 
    
      SSRC, CC and CSRC fields are used as described in RFC 1889 [5]. 
 
       
      RTCP SHOULD be used as defined in RFC 1889 [5].  
        
      Timestamps in RTCP SR packets:  
      The RTP timestamp value is the RTP timestamp that would be 
      applied to an RTP packet for data that would be sent at the 
      instant the SR packet is being generated and sent. 
      The NTP timestamp value is the NPT time at which that SR packet 
      is sent.  
    
    
   5.3  The RTP packet payload 
    
      The RTP packet payload is built from an integer number of 
      complete FlexMux packets, defined in [1]. 
 
   6     Fragmentation rules 
    
     The MPEG-4 FlexMux layer does not fragment SL packets. However, 
     there are two FlexMux tools, the first tool with a packet length 
     limited to 257 bytes (255 bytes for the SL packet), the second 
     tool with a packet length limited to 268 Mbytes. 
      Fragmentation rules are needed on the SL layer.  
      These fragmentation rules for the SL layer are detailed in a 
      section of [14] and in a section of [15], where it is shown how 
      the SL layer may have to be path-MTU aware. 
     
   7     FlexMultiplexing 
    
   7.1  Some of the advantages : 
    
      1. Since a typical MPEG-4 session may involve a large number of 
      objects, that may be as many as a few hundred, transporting 
      each ES as an individual RTP session may not always be 
      practical. The use of one session per elementary stream cannot 
      be much cost effective, both on the server side and on the 
      client side in terms of performance, when the number of 
      elementary streams will increase within a scene.

Internet Draft  RTP payload for MPEG-4 FlexMux streams     November 01 
    
    
      2. The use of one single session for a multiplexed bitstream 
      enables to send a bunch of ESs that are tightly synchronized 
      together. Some of these ESs can themselves be Bifs and OD 
      ESs when a scene description is used with Audio-Visual ES, 
      and some other ESs can be OCI ES, and even IPMP ES when such 
      systems are involved. 
 
      3. The FlexMultiplexing management supports embedding multiple 
      SL packets into one FlexMux packet, by the use of FlexMux 
      codetable entries. 
    
      4. If the multiplexing policy used is smoothing at most the 
      multiplexed SL streams, mutual synchronization between these 
      SL streams can be easily preserved when packet losses occur. 
    
      5. The use of the FlexMux technology enables possible 
      interconnection between Internet network and digital television 
      network, as MPEG normatively defines the use the MPEG-4 FlexMux 
      syntax to carry MPEG-4 over MPEG-2 transport channels[1]. 
    
      6. The reconstruction of the correct timing of the FlexMux 
      stream is possible, using timing samples carried within the 
      FlexMux in-band signalling mechanism, if some QoS requirements 
      are supported. 
    
      7. The overall MPEG-4 receiver buffer size is reduced, as 
      MPEG-4 compliant Flexmultiplexed streams, by the use of the 
      MPEG-4 timestamps, respect the MPEG-4 system decoder model. 
    
      8. The FlexMux stream syntax supports an in-band signalling  
      mechanism that allows to signal dynamically, at anytime, within 
      the stream itself, the bit-rate of the stream (FlexMux streams 
      have a piecewise constant bit-rate), allowing to have an easy 
      bandwidth management. FlexMux descriptors and Ad Hoc descriptors 
      are carried within this in-band signalling mechanism. 
    
      9. Protection can be enhanced by means of repetition of vital SL 
      packets. 
    
      10. Content providers are able to bundle together a single 
      stream with assurance that associated streams will be kept 
      together and synchronized. 
 
   7.2  Disadvantages: 
    
      The major disadvantage with the packetization of the MPEG-4 
      Flexmultiplexed streams is the added packet header overhead. 
      Two FlexMux tools, with two different FlexMux packet length 
      fields are supported.

Internet Draft  RTP payload for MPEG-4 FlexMux streams     November 01 
      According to the size of the Access Units, and to the size of 
      the SL packets, the use of smaller or longer FlexMux  packets, 
      is a way to minimize the overhead, 
      MPEG-4 does not support a reduction mechanism of the carried 
      MPEG-4 Flexmultiplexed streams packet headers. This issue needs 
      certainly be resolved using a mechanism similar to what was 
      proposed with [8].  
    
   8     Handling of scene description streams  
        
      To describe virtual scenes, in addition to the two traditional 
      Audio-visual streams, MPEG-4 introduces two new 'systems' 
      Elementary Streams as described in the section 2, namely the OD 
      (Object Descriptors) and Bifs (Binary format for Scene) streams.  
    
      ODs may be seen, among other things, as a link between the scene 
      description itself and its audio and video contents. ODs allow 
      complete bi-directional independance between a scene and its 
      audiovisual contents.  
       
      This payload format offers a unique solution for downloaded and 
      real-time  applications, where the scene description can be  
      either static or dynamic.  
      If it is required by the implied network, and by the application, 
      the System Elementary streams may be Multiplexed together within 
      a first FlexMux stream, while the audio visual Elementary streams 
      may be Multiplexed within a second FlexMux stream. Each FlexMux 
      stream being assigned a different QoS. 
        
      As applications want to prevent receivers to lose access to a  
      content (in case where an OD update command would be lost, 
      breaking the link between the scene and one of its content),  
      senders must use suitable schemes to transport sensitive  
      configuration information. Such suitable schemes may involve 
      redundancy that can be added by different tools such as packet 
      based FEC, packet duplication, or similar tools.  
   9     Transport of MPEG-4 FlexMux streams 
    
      An MPEG-4 FlexMux packet is mapped directly onto the RTP 
      payload without any addition of extra header fields or removal 
      of any FlexMux packet header syntactic elements. 
      Each RTP packet will contain a timestamp derived from the 
      sender's clock reference, synchronized to the FlexMux Clock.  
      That timestamp represents the target transmission time of the  
      first byte of the RTP packet payload. 
      On the receiving side, the RTP packet timestamp will not be 
      passed to the MPEG-4 Flexdemultiplexor. 
      This use of the timestamp is slightly different from the normal 
      use in RTP, in that it is not considered to be the media 
      display  time-stamp. The first purpose of this RTP timestamp 
      will then be to take over (after estimation) the network  jitter.

Internet Draft  RTP payload for MPEG-4 FlexMux streams     November 01 
       
    
    
      When this is achieved, the FCR samples may be used, on the  
      receiver side to accurately reconstruct the original sender∆s 
      FlexMux clock. 
    
      There are packetization restrictions due to the fact that no 
      synchronization pattern is part of the FlexMux packet header: 
      An RTP packet will contain an integer number of FlexMux packets.   
      An RTP packet payload should start with the start of a FlexMux 
      packet. An RTP packet payload should end with the end of a 
      FlexMux packet.  
    
      The FlexMux descriptors (declaration descriptor, timing 
      descriptor, Channel Table descriptor, codetable entry 
      descriptor, buffersize descriptor,etc..) describing the  
      characteristics of the FlexMux stream may be provided by out 
      of band means (e.g. SDP), and (or) by the inband signalling  
      mechanism supported by the FlexMux stream syntax [1].  
      Ad Hoc (non MPEG) descriptors are also supported. 
    
      When the IP packet marking facility is needed, as it is  based on 
      the 'degradationPriority' field present in each SL packet, all  
      the FlexMux packets grouped in the same RTP packet should contain 
      SL packets where the 'degradationPriority' field should be filled 
      with the same value. 
    
      The size of the FlexMux packets should be adjusted such that 
      the resulting RTP packet (embedding one or several FlexMux 
      packets) is not larger than the path-MTU. 
    
      Protection mechanisms for FlexMux streams within RTP packets 
      are outside of the scope of this specification. 
    
    
    
   10    SDP syntax 
    
     It is assumed that one typical way to signal the FlexMux streams 
     characteristics of this payload format is via a SDP message that 
     may be transported to the client in reply to a RTSP [11] DESCRIBE 
     command, or via SAP [12].  
     The SDP protocol is decribed in [10]. 
      
   10.1 Types and Names  
        
      This section describes the MIME types and names associated with 
      this payload format. This section is intended for registration 
      with IANA [13].

     10.1.1  MIME type registration  
     
      MIME media type name:  "video" or "audio" or "application"  
        
      "video" SHOULD be used for MPEG-4 Visual streams (i.e. video as  
      defined in ISO/IEC 14496-2 [2] and/or graphics as defined in 
      ISO/IEC 14496-1 [1]) or MPEG-4 Systems streams that convey 
      information needed for an audio/visual presentation.  
        
      "audio" SHOULD be used for MPEG-4 Audio streams (ISO/IEC 14496-3) 
      or MPEG-4 Systems streams that convey information needed for an 
      audio only presentation.  
        
      "application" SHOULD be used for MPEG-4 Systems streams  
      (ISO/IEC14496-1) like MPERG-4 FlexMux streams that serve other 
      purposes than only an audio/visual presentation.   
       
      The payload names used in an RTPMAP attribute within SDP, to 
      specify the mapping of payload number to its definition, also 
      come from the MIME namespace.  Each of the RTP payload mappings 
      defined above has a distinct name.  It is recommended that 
      visual streams be identified under 'video', and audio streams 
      be identified under 'audio', and otherwise 'application' be 
      used. 
    
      When a FLexMux stream is served (e.g. over HTTP) or otherwise 
      must be identified by a MIME type, the type 'application/mpeg4- 
      flexmux' SHALL be used.  These files consist of concatenated 
      FLexMux packets in transmission order.

            MIME subtype        name:mpeg4-flexmux, 
                                    
                                       
            Required parameters: mpeg4-flexmuxinfo  
            Optional parameters: none 
            Encoding considerations:base64 generally preferred;

      new registred mpeg4-flexmux MIME  subtype 
       
       
      a = rtpmap:<payload> <name>/<time scale>/<parameters> 
      
      <payload> is the dynamic payload number. 
      <name> equal to mpeg4-flexmux indicates the encoding type 
             of the media, one MPEG-4 FlexMux stream.  
    
      <time scale> is the time scale of the RTP time stamps. 
    
      <parameters> if used, can be a way  to  specialise  <name>. 
    
      Addition of a new attribute:      
      In order to be able to define either in the clear, or in binary 
      format, or to point out to some already defined characteristics 
      (MPEG-4 FlexMux descriptors) of a FlexMux stream, the following 
      attribute is defined 
    
      a = mpeg4-flexmuxinfo: <location of descriptor list> 
    
      <location of descriptor list> is a URL enclosed in double 
             quotes, that will supply the required flexmux list of 
             MPEG-4 FlexMux descriptors.  If they are small, a 
             DATA:URL will probably suffice to carry them in-line. 
             If not, the URL should use a file-retrieval scheme 
            (e.g. HTTP). The data at the indicated URL consists of 
             some number of concatenated complete FlexMux descriptors. 
             These descriptors have an intrinsic length, so simple 
             concatenation suffices. 
       
      The MPEG-4 FlexMux descriptors related to FlexMux description  
      are defined within [1]. The list of MPEG-4 descriptors cannot be 
      empty. Ad Hoc descriptors can complete it.   
       
      Other SDP attributes should, if used, carry values consistent 
      with those carried in MPEG-4 systems (for example, bit rate). 
      
     10.1.3  Examples: 
       
      about mpeg4-flexmuxinfo: 
    
      a = mpeg4-flexmuxinfo:"http://example.com/FlexMuxdescriptor.dat" 
      a = mpeg4-flexmuxinfo:"http://example.com/FlexMuxdescriptor.xml" 
      a = mpeg4-flexmuxinfo: 
      "data:application/mpeg4-flexmuxinfo,7ab3742134bab347" 
      a = mpeg4-flexmuxinfo:"data:text/xml;<FlexMuxdescriptor.../>" 
    
      more general: 
      m = application 4444 RTP/AVP  96 
      a = rtpmap:96 mpeg4-flexmux/1000 
      a = mpeg4-flexmuxinfo:"http://example.com/FlexMuxdescriptor.dat"

   11    RTSP usage: 
    
      
     The RTSP protocol is described in [11]. 
      When RTSP is used as a session-control protocol, RTP SHOULD be 
      used as the transport protocol. 
       
    
    
      The initial DESCRIBE format SHOULD be SDP.  If the SDP 
      information reveals that an IOD is needed, and the terminal 
      does not already have it, then a second DESCRIBE accepting an  
      IOD SHOULD be performed. 
       
      Note that if an MPEG-4 FlexMux stream is closed (TEARDOWN) then 
      the RTSP session ID will be lost.  The next (re-)opened FlexMux 
      stream will supply a new session ID. New DESCRIBEs may be 
      needed. 
    
    
    
   12    Security Considerations 
    
    
      RTP packets transporting information with the proposed payload 
      format are subject to the security considerations discussed in 
      the RTP specification [5]. This implies that confidentiality of 
      the media streams is achieved by encryption.  
    
      If the entire stream (extension data and AU data) is to be 
      secured and all the participants are expected to have the keys 
      to decode the entire stream, then the encryption is performed  
      in the usual manner, and there is no conflict between the two 
      operations (encapsulation and encryption). 
    
      The need for a portion of stream (e.g. extension data) to be 
      encrypted with a different key, or not to be encrypted, would 
      require application level signalling protocols to be aware of  
      the usage of the XT field, and to exchange keys and negotiate  
      their usage on the media and extension data separately.
