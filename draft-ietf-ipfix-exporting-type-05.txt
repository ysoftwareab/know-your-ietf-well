Abstract

   This document describes an extension to the IP Flow Information
   Export (IPFIX) protocol, which is used to represent and transmit data
   from IP flow measurement devices for collection, storage and
   analysis, to allow the encoding of IPFIX Information Model properties
   within an IPFIX Message stream.  This enables the export of extended
   type information for enterprise-specific Information Elements, and
   the storage of such information within IPFIX Files, facilitating
   interoperability and reusability among a wide variety of applications
   and tools.

Internet-Draft           IPFIX Type Information                June 2009


1.  Introduction

   IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) provides a template mechanism for
   the flexible description of Data Records, by defining a record as a
   collection of Information Elements defined in an IANA registry,
   However, these Templates provide limited information about the type
   of described data; indeed, they encode only the size of the fields
   defined by these Information Elements.  There presently exists no
   mechanism to provide full type information for these Information
   Elements, as is defined for the Information Elements in the IPFIX
   Information Model.

   This especially limits the interoperability of enterprise-specific
   Information Elements.  It is not possible to use analysis tools on
   IPFIX records containing these partially defined Information Elements
   that have not been developed with a priori knowledge of their types,
   since such tools will not be able to decode them; these tools can
   only treat and store them as opaque octet arrays.  However, if richer
   information is available, additional operations such as efficient
   storage, display, and limited analysis of records containing
   enterprise-specific Information Elements become possible, even for
   Collecting Processes that had not been specifically developed to
   understand them.

   This document defines a general mechanism to encode the full set of
   properties available for the definition of Information Elements
   within the IPFIX Information Model inline within an IPFIX Message
   stream using IPFIX Options.  This mechanism may be used to fully
   define type information for Information Elements used within a
   message stream, without resort to an external reference or reliance
   on out-of-band configuration, thereby improving the interoperability
   of enterprise-specific Information Elements.

   Note that the solution described in this draft is not intended as a
   replacement for registration with IANA of generally useful
   Information Elements.  It introduces overhead and does not lead to
   real interoperability as provided by standardization.  Therefore we
   highly recommend to standardize all new generally useful Information
   Elements by registering them with IANA.  Standardization is
   straightforward, and the type information that needs to be specified
   in order to support the proposed solution provides a perfect basis
   for the description required for standardizing the Information
   Element.

   It might happen that an Information Element previously described by
   the mechanism in this document later becomes an IANA-registered,
   standard Information Element.  In such environments old and new
   versions of the Information Element can coexist.  A translation

   between Information Elements expressed by the described solution and
   standardized Information Elements is therefore not necessary, and is
   out of scope for this document.

1.1.  IPFIX Documents Overview

   "Specification of the IPFIX Protocol for the Exchange of IP Traffic
   Flow Information" [RFC5101] (informally, the IPFIX Protocol document)
   and its associated documents define the IPFIX Protocol, which
   provides network engineers and administrators with access to IP
   traffic flow information.

   "Architecture for IP Flow Information Export" [RFC5470] (the IPFIX
   Architecture document) defines the architecture for the export of
   measured IP flow information out of an IPFIX Exporting Process to an
   IPFIX Collecting Process, and the basic terminology used to describe
   the elements of this architecture, per the requirements defined in
   "Requirements for IP Flow Information Export" [RFC3917].  The IPFIX
   Protocol document [RFC5101] then covers the details of the method for
   transporting IPFIX Data Records and Templates via a congestion-aware
   transport protocol from an IPFIX Exporting Process to an IPFIX
   Collecting Process.

   "Information Model for IP Flow Information Export" [RFC5102]
   (informally, the IPFIX Information Model document) describes the
   Information Elements used by IPFIX, including details on Information
   Element naming, numbering, and data type encoding.

   This document references the Protocol and Architecture documents for
   terminology and extends the IPFIX Information Model to provide new
   Information Elements for the representation of Information Element
   properties.  It draws data type definitions and data type semantics
   definitions from the Information Model; the encodings of these data
   types are defined in [RFC5101].


2.  Terminology

   Terms used in this document that are defined in the Terminology
   section of the IPFIX Protocol [RFC5101] document are to be
   interpreted as defined there.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Type Information Export

   This section describes the mechanism used to encode Information
   Element type information within an IPFIX Message stream.  This
   mechanism consists of an Options Template Record used to define
   Information Element type records, and a set of Information Elements
   required by these type records.  We first specify the necessary
   Information Elements, followed by the structure of the Options
   Template describing the type records.

   Note that Information Element type records require one Information
   Element, informationElementId, that is defined in the PSAMP
   Information Model [RFC5477].  This Information Element supports
   references only to IANA-defined Information Elements; the
   privateEnterpriseNumber Information Element is required alongside
   informationElementId to describe enterprise-specific Information
   Elements.

3.1.  informationElementDataType

   Description:   A description of the abstract data type of an IPFIX
      information element.  These are taken from the abstract data types
      defined in section 3.1 of the IPFIX Information Model [RFC5102];
      see that section for more information on the types described
      below.  This field may take the values defined in Table 1 below.

      the privateEnterpriseNumber to 0, or do not export the
      privateEnterpriseNumber in the type record.  To export type
      information about an enterprise-specific Information Element,
      export the enterprise number in privateEnterpriseNumber, and
      export the Information Element number with the Enterprise bit
      cleared in informationElementId.  The Enterprise bit in the
      associated informationElementId Information Element MUST be
      ignored by the Collecting Process.

3.9.  Information Element Type Options Template

   The Information Element Type Options Template attaches type
   information to Information Elements used within Template Records, as
   scoped to an Observation Domain within a Transport Session.  This
   provides a mechanism for representing an IPFIX Information Model
   inline within an IPFIX Message stream.  Data Records described by
   this template are referred to as Information Element type records.

   In deployments in which interoperability across vendor
   implementations of IPFIX is important, an Exporting Process exporting
   data using Templates containing enterprise-specific Information
   Elements SHOULD export an Information Element type record for each
   enterprise-specific Information Element it exports.  Collecting
   Processes MAY use these type records to improve handling of unknown
   enterprise-specific Information Elements.  Exporting Processes using
   enterprise-specific Information Elements to implement proprietary
   features MAY omit type records for those Information Elements.

   Information Element type records MUST be handled by Collecting
   Processes as scoped to the Transport Session in which they are sent;
   this facility is not intended to provide a method for the permanent
   definition of Information Elements.

   Similarly, for security reasons, type information for a given
   Information Element MUST NOT be re-defined by Information Element
   type records, and a Collecting Process MUST NOT allow an Information

   Element type record to replace its own internal definition of an
   Information Element.  Information Element type records SHOULD NOT be
   duplicated in a given Observation Domain within a Transport Session.
   Once an Information Element type record has been exported for a given
   Information Element within a given Transport Session, all subsequent
   type records for that Information Element MUST be identical.
   Information Elements for which a Collecting Process receives
   conflicting semantic or type information MUST be ignored.

   Note that while this template MAY be used to export information about
   any Information Element, including those registered with IANA,
   Exporting Processes SHOULD NOT export any type records that could be
   reasonably assumed to duplicate type information available at the
   Collecting Process.  This mechanism is not intended as a replacement
   for Exporting and Collecting Processes keeping up to date with
   changes to the IANA registry; such an update mechanism is out of
   scope for this document.

   The template SHOULD contain the Information Elements in Table 4,
   below, as defined in the PSAMP Information Model [RFC5477] and in
   this document, above.

3.10.  Data Type and Semantics Restrictions

   Note that the informationElementSemantics values defined in section
   3.2 of [RFC5102] are primarily intended to differentiate semantic
   interpretation of numeric values, and that not all combinations of
   the informationElementDataType and informationElementSemantics
   Information Elements are valid; e.g., a counter cannot be encoded as
   an IPv4 address.  The following are acceptable values of
   informationElementSemantics:

   o  Any value is valid for unsigned informationElementDataType values
      ("unsigned8", "unsigned16", "unsigned32", or "unsigned64").

   o  Any value except "flags" is valid for signed
      informationElementDataType values ("signed8", "signed16",
      "signed32", or "signed64").

   o  Any value except "identifier" or "flags" is valid for floating-
      point informationElementDataType values ("float32" or "float64").

   o  Only "default" is valid for all other other
      informationElementDataType values ("octetArray", "boolean",
      "macAddress", "string", "dateTimeSeconds", "dateTimeMilliseconds",

      "dateTimeMicroseconds", "dateTimeNanoseconds", "ipv4Address", or
      "ipv6Address").

   Information Element type records containing invalid combinations of
   informationElementSemantics and informationElementDataType MUST NOT
   be sent by Exporting Processes, and MUST be ignored by Collecting
   Processes.

   Future standards actions that modify the Information Element Data
   Type subregistry or the Information Element Semantics subregistry
   should contain a Data Type and Semantics Restrictions sections such
   as this one to define allowable combinations of type and semantics
   information.


4.  Security Considerations

   The same security considerations as for the IPFIX Protocol [RFC5101]
   apply.

   Attention must be paid to the handling of Information Element type
   records at the Collecting Process.  Type information precedence rules
   defined above (a Collecting Process' current knowledge overrides type
   records; types are not redefinable during a session) are designed to
   minimize the opportunity for an attacker to maliciously redefine the
   data model.

   Note that Information Element type records may contain two strings
   describing Information Elements: informationElementName and
   informationElementDescription.  IPFIX strings on the wire are length-
   prefixed and UTF-8 [RFC3629] encoded, most often within an IPFIX
   variable-length Information Element, which mitigates the risk of
   unterminated-string attacks against IPFIX Collecting Processes.
   However, care should still be taken when handling strings within the
   type system of the Collecting Process.

   First, Collecting Processes should pay particular attention to buffer
   sizes converting between length-prefixed and null-terminated strings.
   Exporting Processes MUST NOT export, and Collecting Processes MUST
   ignore, any informationElementName or informationElementDescription
   content which contains null characters (U+0000) in order to ensure
   buffer and string lengths are consistent.

   Also, note that there is no limit to IPFIX string length beyond that
   inherent in the protocol.  The maximum IPFIX string length is 65512
   octets (maximum message length (65535), minus message header (16),
   minus set header (4), minus long variable length field (3)).
   Specifically, although the informationElementName of all IANA



Boschi, et al.          Expires December 11, 2009              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft           IPFIX Type Information                June 2009


   Information Elements at the time of this writing is less than about
   40 octets, and the informationElementDescription is less than 4096
   octets, either of these Information Elements may contain strings up
   to 65512 octets long.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document specifies the creation of several new IPFIX Information
   Elements in the IPFIX Information Element registry as defined in
   section 3 above.  IANA has assigned the following Information Element
   numbers for their respective Information Elements as specified below:

   o  Information Element Number TBD1 for the informationElementDataType
      Information Element

   o  Information Element Number TBD2 for the
      informationElementDescription Information Element

   o  Information Element Number TBD3 for the informationElementName
      Information Element

   o  Information Element Number TBD4 for the
      informationElementRangeBegin Information Element

   o  Information Element Number TBD5 for the informationElementRangeEnd
      Information Element

   o  Information Element Number TBD6 for the
      informationElementSemantics Information Element

   o  Information Element Number TBD7 for the informationElementUnits
      Information Element

   o  Information Element Number TBD8 for the privateEnterpriseNumber
      Information Element

   o  [NOTE for IANA: The text TBD1, TBD2, TBD3, TBD4, TBD5, TBD6, TBD7,
      and TBD8 should be replaced with the respective assigned
      Information Element numbers where they appear in this document.]

   IANA has created an Information Element Data Type subregistry for the
   values defined for the informationElementSemantics Information
   Element.  Entries may be added to this subregistry subject to a
   Standards Action [RFC5226].

   [NOTE for IANA: Please create a new Information Element Data Type
   subregistry as specified in the paragraph above, with values taken

   subregistry as specified in the paragraph above, with values taken

   IANA has created an Information Element Units subregistry for the
   values defined for the informationElementUnits Information Element.
   Entries may be added to this subregistry on an Expert Review
   [RFC5226] basis.

Appendix A.  Examples

   The following example illustrates how the type information extension
   mechanism defined in this document may be used to describe the
   semantics of enterprise-specific Information Elements.  The
   Information Elements used in this example are as follows:

   o  initialTCPFlags, an example private IE 14, 1 octet, the TCP flags
      on the first TCP packet in the flow.

   o  unionTCPFlags, an example private IE 15, 1 octet, the union of the
      TCP flags on all packets after the first TCP packet in the flow.

   An Exporting Process exporting flows containing these Information
   Elements might use a Template like the following:

   However, a Collecting Process receiving Data Sets described by this
   Template can only treat the enterprise-specific Information Elements
   as opaque octets; specifically, there is no hint to the collector
   that they contain flag information.  To use the type information
   extension mechanism to address this problem, the Exporting Process
   would first export the Information Element Type Options Template
   described in section 3.9 above:
