1. Introduction 
 
The document "SMIng Objectives", that has been circulating for 
several months as an Internet Draft [SMING-OBJ], "describes the 
objectives for a new data definition language, suitable for the 
modeling of network management constructs, that can be directly 
mapped into SNMP and COPS-PR protocol operations" ([SMING-OBJ], 
Abstract). It is assumed that the contents and the purposes of that 
document are already well-known and understood by the readers of 
this memo, therefore they will not be illustrated here.  
 
This proposal recognizes all those objectives as valid and addresses 
most of them, and by doing so, provides a more expressive and 
complete representation of management information than is currently 
possible with SMIv2 and SPPI. 
 
Several proposals have been submitted so far (see [SMING-NMRG], 
[SMI-DS]), and this document acknowledges their value. However, it 
is believed that a different solution, based on an existing formal 
notation rather than on a completely new language, may be more 
viable. 
 
This proposal is based on the ASN.1 language, and provides an ASN.1 
module that defines a set of constructs which allow to specify 
management information structures.

A later section of this document lists all the SMIng requirements 
from [SMING-OBJ] and contains a statement of compliance for each 
item.   
  
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 
 
 
2. ASN.1 
 
The ASN.1 language has evolved considerably during the last decade, 
and is very lively today (see http://asn1.elibel.tm.fr). Among the 
most important achievements in the development of the language, that 
are relevant to this document, have been: 
 
    - the establishment of a rich set of elementary types, with a 
well-defined syntax and semantics; 
 
    - the introduction of "information object classes", 
"information objects" and "information object sets", that enable the 
language to describe complex relationships between types, values and 
other elements defined in the specification, such as other 
"information objects" and "information object sets"; 
 
    - the ability to specify a "user-defined syntax" for defining 
these information objects; 
 
    - the ability to specify sophisticated constraints on the 
validity of values, such as the "table constraints" and "component 
relation constraints" between the components of a SEQUENCE type, and 
the "content" constraint on values of type OCTET STRING and BIT 
STRING; 
 
    - the introduction of the types RELATIVE-OID and UTF8String. 
     
The standard documents where the ASN.1 language is specified 
([X.680], [X.681], [X.682], [X.683], [X.690] and [X.691]) are 
available on the ITU-T website 
(http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/languages) and can be 
downloaded free of charge. 
 
Two electronic publications that fully cover the ASN.1 language can 
also be downloaded free of charge from the Web ([ASN1-DUB] and 
[ASN1-LAR]). 
 
Although the primary purpose of ASN.1 is the specification of the 
data structures exchanged in protocols, the ability to specify 
complex structures of meta-information (which is not meant to be 
transmitted) in a completely formal way makes ASN.1 an ideal 
candidate as a language for specifying structures of management 
information.

3. The ASN.1 SMIng module 
 
This document presents an ASN.1 module (ASN1-SMIng) that defines a 
set of basic types and a set of constructs which allow an expressive 
and complete representation of structures of management information. 
 
These constructs are specified in terms of "information object 
classes" and their associated "user-defined syntax", and are fully 
defined by means of the standard ASN.1 grammar. These facilities, 
that replaced the "macros" existing in earlier versions of ASN.1, 
are suitable to represent structured information in a formal manner. 
In the context of this document, the constructs defined in the ASN.1 
SMIng module will be referred to as "ASN.1 SMIng statements" or just 
"statements".  
 
The following basic types are defined in the module: 
 
       Integer32 
       Integer64  
       Unsigned32  
       Unsigned64  
       Float32 
       Float64  
       Float128 
       Counter32  
       Counter64  
       TimeTicks  
       IpAddress  
       Opaque 
       SMICharacterString  
       SMIOctetString 
       Status  
       MaxAccess  
       NamingScheme  
       EntityInstanceRelationship 
       MaxOperation 
 
 
The following statements are defined in the module: 
 
       MODULE-INFO 
       ENTITY-CLASS 
       EVENT 
       ENTITY-INSTANCE 
       NOTIFICATION 
       NODE 
       NODE-GROUP 
       COMPLIANCE-STATEMENT

Internet Draft           ASN.1 for SMIng        November 13, 2001 
The statements are presented in the following subsections. See 
appendix A for the definitions of the basic types. 
 
 
3.1 MODULE-INFO 
 
Allows the specification of information related to the SMIng MIB 
module itself, such as ORGANIZATION, CONTACT, REVISIONS (DATE and 
DESCRIPTION), STATUS and DESCRIPTION.  
 
A MODULE-INFO statement MUST be included somewhere in the SMIng MIB 
module. 
 
The parameters ORGANIZATION, CONTACT and DESCRIPTION have the same 
format and meaning of the corresponding parameters in [SMING-NMRG]. 
 
The STATUS parameter MUST be a value of type Status: 
 
    Status ::= ENUMERATED { current, deprecated, obsolete } 
 
It has the same meaning as the corresponding parameter in [SMING-
NMRG], apart from the different format. 
 
The DATE parameter is of type GeneralizedTime. 
 
The MODULE-INFO statement has the following ASN.1 definition: 
 
 
    MODULE-INFO ::= CLASS { 
        &organization SMICharacterString, 
        &contact      SMICharacterString, 
        &Revisions    MODULE-REVISION, 
        &status      Status DEFAULT current, 
        &description  SMICharacterString }  
 
    WITH SYNTAX   {  
        ORGANIZATION &organization  
        CONTACT &contact 
        REVISIONS &Revisions  
        [STATUS &status]  
        DESCRIPTION &description } 
 
 
    MODULE-REVISION ::= CLASS { 
        &date        GeneralizedTime, 
        &description  SMICharacterString } 
 
    WITH SYNTAX   {  
        DATE &date  
        DESCRIPTION &description }

    module-info MODULE-INFO ::= { 
        ORGANIZATION "Name of the Organization" 
        CONTACT "Contact person" 
 
        REVISIONS { 
            { DATE "20010714130000Z"  
              DESCRIPTION  
                "Description of the initial version" } | 
            { DATE "20010903220000Z" 
              DESCRIPTION  
                "Description of the first revision" } } 
 
        STATUS current 
        DESCRIPTION "Description of module and Reference" } 
 
 
3.2 ENTITY-CLASS 
 
Allows the definition of an "entity class".  
 
An entity class is an ASN.1 type together with essential information 
about the type. The entity class will be subsequently referenced by 
ENTITY-INSTANCE statements (in the same module or in another module 
that imports the entity class), which will declare instances of the 
entity class (see subsection 3.4). 
 
The type can be either a simple type (such as an Integer32 or an 
OBJECT IDENTIFIER), or an aggregate type (SEQUENCE), or an array 
type (SEQUENCE OF). 
 
For simple types, the parameters UNITS and DISPLAY-FORMAT MAY be 
specified (both are optional). These parameters have the same format 
and meaning as in [SMING-NMRG]. 
 
For SEQUENCE types, the parameters ASSIGNED-ATTRIBUTE-IDS and 
ATTRIBUTE-INFO apply. 
 
The parameter ASSIGNED-ATTRIBUTE-IDS (optional) specifies an ordered 
list of "attribute identifiers" (of the ASN.1 type RELATIVE-OID) 
that are assigned to the components of the SEQUENCE, in order. If 
this parameter is absent, the attribute identifiers  
     
    {1} {2} {3} ... 
 
are assigned by default to the components. 
 
The parameter ATTRIBUTE-INFO specifies the properties of the 
attributes of the entity class (components of the SEQUENCE that have 
been assigned attribute identifiers). These properties are MAX-
ACCESS, STATUS and DESCRIPTION.  
 
The MAX-ACCESS parameter MUST be a value of type MaxAccess: 
Expires May 13, 2002                                      [Page 6] 
Internet Draft           ASN.1 for SMIng        November 13, 2001 
 
    MaxAccess ::= ENUMERATED { none,  
        notificationsOnly, readOnly, readWrite } 
   
The STATUS parameter MUST be a value of type Status: 
 
    Status ::= ENUMERATED { current, deprecated, obsolete } 
 
These parameters have the same meaning as the corresponding 
parameters in [SMING-NMRG], apart from the different format. 
 
For SEQUENCE OF types, the parameters INDEXING-ATTRIBUTES and 
NAMING-SCHEME apply. 
 
INDEXING-ATTRIBUTES (optional) is a list of the attribute 
identifiers (RELATIVE-OID) that make up the index of the array type. 
Any instances of this entity class that are subsequently declared 
will be indexed by these attributes. If this parameter is absent, 
the array type is not indexed (this is useful for defining tables 
that have an AUGMENTS or EXTENDS relationship with another table: 
see 3.4).  
 
NAMING-SCHEME (optional) indicates which mechanism is to be used to 
form the complete OBJECT IDENTIFIERS that identify the data items of 
a table (entity instance) of this array type. This parameter MUST be 
a value of type NamingScheme:  
 
    NamingScheme ::= ENUMERATED { tabular, hierarchical,  
        extensible }  
 
"tabular" means that the attribute identifiers (which identify a 
column of a table) are appended to the OBJECT IDENTIFIER that 
identifies the entity instance (the whole table) first, and the OID 
components that identify the row (which are extracted from the 
indexing attributes) are appended after. This models the traditional 
object naming scheme of SMI. 
 
"hierarchical" means that the OID components that identify the row 
(which are extracted from the indexing attributes) are appended to 
the OBJECT IDENTIFIER that identifies the entity instance (the whole 
table) first, and the attribute identifiers (which identify the 
column) are appended after. If an arbitrarily-complex data structure 
is defined (with arrays nested within elements of other arrays, and 
so on), this scheme can be used to assign cleanly hierarchical 
OBJECT IDENTIFIERs to all the data items contained in an entity 
instance.  
  
"extensible" is similar to "hierarchical", except that an extra 
component is inserted in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER after the components 
that identify the row, and before the attribute identifiers. This 
component is called the "extension identifier" and is provided by 
the EXTENSION parameter (see below).

Internet Draft           ASN.1 for SMIng        November 13, 2001 
If the NAMING-SCHEME parameter is absent, "tabular" is assumed by 
default. 
 
The EXTENSION parameter (optional) specifies the value of the 
"extension identifier" if the NAMING-SCHEME is "extensible". If it 
is absent, the value 0 is assumed by default. 
 
The ENTITY-CLASS statement has the following ASN.1 definition: 
 
 
    ENTITY-CLASS ::= CLASS { 
        &Syntax, 
        &units       SMICharacterString OPTIONAL,

3.4 ENTITY-INSTANCE 
 
Allows the declaration of an instance of an entity class. The entity 
instance can be either of a simple type, or of an aggregate type or 
a table, depending on the entity class. 
 
Multiple entity instances can be declared of the same entity class. 
Each entity instance is assigned an OBJECT IDENTIFIER. 
 
If the entity class of an entity instance is based on a SEQUENCE OF 
type (i.e., a table), it can be specified by means of the MAX-
OPERATION parameter if is acceptable to dynamically create/delete 
rows from the table.  
 
If the entity class of an entity instance is an indexed array type, 
the table is indexed. The particular mechanism for assigning names 
(OBJECT IDENTIFIERs) to the data items of the table is specified in 
the ENTITY-CLASS statement (see 3.2). 
 
If the entity class of an entity instance is an array type without 
an INDEXING-ATTRIBUTES parameter, the table is not indexed. Such a 
table must be linked to another table by means of the BASE-ENTITY-
INSTANCE and RELATIONSHIP parameters.

4. Compliance with the SMIng Work Group objectives 
 
This section lists all the objectives specified in [SMING-OBJ]. For 
each objective, one of the following statements is made: 
 
    - MET: the objective is deemed fully met by this proposal 
 
    - PARTIALLY MET: the objective is deemed partially met by this 
proposal 
 
    - NOT ADDRESSED: the objective, listed in [SMING-OBJ] as a 
"nice-to-have" or "rejected" objective, has not been taken into 
account in the development of this proposal  
     
    Wherever necessary, an explanation and/or an example is given. 
The numbering and naming of subsections is the same as in [SMING-
OBJ]. 
 
 
4.1 Accepted Objectives 
 
4.1.1 The Set of Specification Documents 
 
   Description: SMIv2 is defined in three documents, based on an      
obsolete ITU ASN.1 specification. SPPI is defined in one       
document, based on SMIv2. The core of SMIng must be defined in      
one document and must be independent of external specifications. 
 
PARTIALLY MET  
 
Expires May 13, 2002                                     [Page 15] 
Internet Draft           ASN.1 for SMIng        November 13, 2001 
The minimum set of documents that are needed in order to write an 
ASN.1 SMIng specification based on current, accepted and freely 
available international standards are the following: 
 
    1) ITU-T Recommendation X.680 (1997) | ISO/IEC 8824-1:1998, 
"Information technology “ Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1): 
Specification of basic notation" [X.680]; 
 
    2) ITU-T Recommendation X.681 (1997) | ISO/IEC 8824 2:1998, 
"Information technology “ Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1): 
Information object specification" [X.681]; 
 
    3) This document. 
 
The ITU-T Recommendations that specify the ASN.1 language are 
downloadable free-of-charge from the ITU-T website 
(http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/languages).  
 
Most of the information actually needed in order to write an ASN.1 
SMIng specification is contained in this document. 
 
 
 
4.1.2 Textual Representation 
 
   Description: SMIng definitions must be represented in a textual      
format. 
 
MET 
 
ASN.1 is a textual language. 
 
 
 
4.1.3 Human Readability 
 
   Description: The syntax must make it easy for humans to directly 
read and write SMIng modules.   
 
MET 
 
The ASN.1 language is very oriented towards human readability. This 
is especially true when user-defined syntax is specified for an 
information object class. 
 
 
 
4.1.4 Rigorously Defined Syntax 
 
   Description: There must be a rigorously defined syntax for the 
SMIng language. 
 
MET 
Expires May 13, 2002                                     [Page 16] 
Internet Draft           ASN.1 for SMIng        November 13, 2001 
 
The ASN.1 language itself is rigorously defined.  
 
Moreover, the 1994 version of ASN.1 introduced "information object 
classes", "information objects" and "information object sets", that 
allow, among other things, to define new specific, application-
oriented constructs having a rigorously-defined syntax and a clear 
associated semantics, and from which an ABNF can easily be derived.  
 
This proposal makes extensive use of this capability and specifies a 
whole set of these constructs. 
 
 
 
4.1.5 Accessibility 
 
   Description: Attribute definitions must indicate whether 
attributes can be read, written, created, deleted, and whether they 
are accessible for notifications, or are not accessible.  Align PIB-
ACCESS and MAX-ACCESS, and PIB-MIN-ACCESS and MIN-ACCESS. 
 
MET 
 
(Example to be included) 
 
 
 
4.1.6 Language Extensibility 
 
   Description: The language must have characteristics, so that 
future modules can contain information of future syntax without 
breaking original SMIng parsers. 
 
MET  
 
Language extensibility is achieved by using the ASN.1 language to 
define all the constructs that make up the "ASN.1 SMIng" itself. 
These constructs are specified in ASN.1 as "information object 
classes", each with its associated "defined syntax" and semantics.  
 
ASN.1 SMIng parsers will never be affected by any changes in the 
defined syntax, because they will know how to parse any (present or 
future) specification by first parsing the definitions imported from 
the ASN.1 SMIng module (that is referenced in the specification). 
This is a property of ASN.1. 
 
 
4.1.7 Special Characters in Text 
 
   Description: Allow an escaping mechanism to encode special 
characters, e.g.  double quotes and new-line characters, in text 
such as DESCRIPTIONs or REFERENCEs.

MET 
 
This feature is present in ASN.1. 
 
  
 
4.1.8 Naming 
 
   Description: SMIng must provide mechanisms to uniquely identify 
attributes, groups of attributes, and events.  It is necessary to 
specify how name collisions are handled. 
 
MET  
 
(Example to be included) 
 
 
 
4.1.9 Namespace Control 
 
   Description: There must be a hierarchical, centrally-controlled       
namespace for standard named items, and a distributed namespace       
must be supported to allow vendor-specific naming and to assure      
unique module names across vendors and organizations. 
 
MET  
 
The model of SMI/SNMP for naming objects is retained in this 
proposal. 
 
 
 
4.1.10 Modules 
 
   Description: SMIng must provide a mechanism for uniquely 
identifying a module, and specifying the status, contact person, 
revision information, and the purpose of a module. SMIng must 
provide mechanisms to group definitions into modules and it must 
provide rules for referencing definitions from other modules 
 
MET  
 
Handling of module information in this proposal is aligned with the 
[SMING-NMRG] proposal.

requirements implementers must meet to claim conformance to a 
standard based on the module. 
 
MET  
 
Handling of conformance statements in this proposal is aligned with 
the [SMING-NMRG] proposal. 
 
(Example to be included) 
 
 
4.1.12 Arbitrary Unambiguous Identities 
 
   Description: SMI allows the use of OBJECT-IDENTITIES to define 
unambiguous identities without the need of a central registry. SMI 
uses OIDs to represent values that represent references to such 
identities.  SMIng needs a similar mechanism (a statement to 
register identities, and a base type to represent values). 
 
MET  
 
Handling of nodes, groups and OIDs in this proposal is aligned with 
the [SMING-NMRG] proposal. 
 
(Example to be included) 
 
 
 
4.1.13 Protocol Independence 
 
   Description: SMIng must define data definitions in support of the 
SNMP and COPS-PR protocols.  SMIng may define data definitions in 
support of other protocols. 
 
(Yet to be addressed)  
 
 
 
4.1.14 Protocol Mapping 
 
   Description: The SMIng working group, in accordance with the 
working group charter, will define mappings of protocol independent 
data definitions to protocols based upon installed 
implementations.The SMIng working group can define mappings to other 
protocols as long as this does not impede the progress on other 
objectives. 
 
(Yet to be addressed)  
 
Mapping to SNMP is built into this proposal.

4.1.15 Translation to Other Data Definition Languages 
 
   Description: SMIng language constructs must, wherever possible, 
be translatable to SMIv2 and SPPI.  At the time of standardization 
of a SMIng language, existing SMIv2 MIBs and SPPI PIBs on the 
standards track will not be required to be translated to the SMIng 
language. New MIBs/PIBs will be defined using the SMIng language. 
 
MET  
 
This proposal contains constructs that have correspondent constructs 
in the [SMING-NMRG] proposal.  
 
However this proposal allows different object naming schemes and 
allows the definition of more-complex data structures than can be 
mapped to SMI and SPPI straightforwardly. 
 
(Example to be included) 
 
 
 
4.1.16 Base Data Types 
 
   Description: SMIng must support the base data types Integer32, 
Unsigned32, Integer64, Unsigned64, Enumeration, Bits, OctetString, 
and OID. 
 
MET 
 
The types ENUMERATED, BIT STRING, OCTET STRING and OBJECT IDENTIFIER 
are built-in ASN.1 types. The types Integer32, Unsigned32, 
Integer64, Unsigned64, SMIOctetString, and SMICharacterString are 
defined in the ASN.1 SMIng module by derivation from built-in types 
with the use of subtype constraints.  
 
 
4.1.17 Enumerations 
 
   Description: SMIng must provide support for enumerations.  
Enumerated values must be a part of the enumeration definition. 
 
MET 
 
The ENUMERATED type is built into ASN.1 and has an inherent 
constraint on the values. 
 
 
4.1.18 Discriminated Unions 
 
   Description: SMIng must support discriminated unions.

Pointers to instances can be specified as components of type OBJECT 
IDENTIFIER referencing an instance.

4.1.23 Extended Data Types 
 
   Description: SMIng must support a mechanism to derive new types, 
which provide additional semantics (e.g., Counters, Gauges, Strings, 
etc.), from base types.  It may be desirable to also allow the 
derivation of new types from derived types.  New types must be as 
restrictive or more restrictive than the types that they are 
specializing. 
 
MET 
 
The ASN.1 language has a sophisticated capability to derive new 
types from other types. Additional information on the new derived 
types is provided by the constructs defined in the ASN.1 SMIng 
module.

4.1.24 Units, Formats, and Default Values of Defined Types and 
       Attributes 
 
   Description: In SMIv2 OBJECT-TYPE definitions may contain UNITS

HINTs. In a similar fashion units and default values must be 
applicable to defined types and format information must be 
applicable to attributes.

4.1.27 Attribute Groups 
 
   Description: An attribute group is a named, reusable set of 
attributes that are meaningful together.  It can be reused as the 
type of attributes in other attribute groups (see also Section 
4.1.28). This is similar to `structs' in C. 
 
MET 
 
In this proposal, attribute groups can be specified as "entity 
classes" based on ASN.1 SEQUENCEs.

4.1.28 Containment 
 
   Description: SMIng must provide support for the creation of new 
attribute groups from attributes of more basic types and potentially 
other attribute groups. 
 
MET  
 
In this proposal, this is achieved by re-using an "entity class" 
based on a SEQUENCE, either as a component of an outer "entity

with the [SMING-NMRG], [SMING-SNMP] proposal. 
 
 
4.1.33 Range and Size Constraints 
 
   Description: SMIng must allow specifying range and size 
constraints where applicable. 
 
MET 
 
Range and size constraints are built into ASN.1. 
 
 
4.1.34 Uniqueness

4.1.35 Extension Rules 
 
   Description: SMIng must provide clear rules how one can extend 
SMIng modules without causing interoperability problems "over the 
wire". 
 
(Yet to be addressed) 
 
  
 
4.1.36 Deprecate Use of IMPLIED Keyword 
 
   Description: The SMIng SNMP mapping must deprecate the use of the 
IMPLIED indexing schema. 
 
MET  
 
This facility is not provided. 
 
 
4.1.37 No Redundancy 
 
   Description: The SMIng language must avoid redundancy. 
 
MET  
 
This proposal does not require the user to specify redundant 
information. 
 
 
4.1.38 Compliance and Conformance 
 
   Description: SMIng must provide a mechanism for compliance and 
conformance specifications for protocol-independent definitions as 
well as for protocol mappings. 
 
MET  
 
Compliance and conformance handling in this proposal is aligned with 
the [SMING-NMRG], [SMING-SNMP] proposal.

4.1.40 Categories 
 
   Description: SMIng must provide a mechanism to group definitions 
into subject categories.  Concrete instances may only exist in the 
scope of a given subject category or context. 
 
(Yet to be addressed) 
 
 
 
4.1.41 Core Language Keywords vs. Defined Identifiers 
 
   Description: In SMI and SPPI modules some language keywords 
(macros and a number of basetypes) have to be imported from 
different SMI language defining modules, e.g.  OBJECT-TYPE, MODULE-
IDENTITY, Integer32 must to be imported from SNMPv2-SMI and TEXTUAL-
CONVENTION must be imported from SNMPv2-TC, if used.  MIB authors 
are continuously confused about these import rules.  In SMIng only 
defined identifiers must be imported.  All SMIng language keywords 
must be implicitly known and there must not be a need to import them 
from any module. 
 
PARTIALLY MET  
 
There is only one module (the ASN.1 SMIng module) from which all the 
SMIng definitions are to be imported. 
 
 
4.1.42 Instance Naming 
 
   Description: Instance naming in SMIv2 and SPPI is different.  
SMIng must align the instance naming (either in the protocol neutral 
model or the protocol mappings). 
 
(Yet to be addressed) 
 
 
4.1.43 Length of Identifiers 
 
   Description: The allowed length of the various kinds of 
identifiers must be extended from the current `should not exceed 32' 
(maybe even from the `must not exceed 64') rule. 
 
MET 
 
ASN.1 imposes no limit on the length of identifiers. 
 
 
4.1.44 Assign OIDs in the Protocol Mappings 
 
   Description: SMIng must not assign OIDs to reusable definition of 
attributes, attribute groups, events, etc.  Instead, SNMP and COPS-
PR mappings must assign OIDs to the mapped items.

In this proposal, OBJECT IDENTIFIERs are assigned to "entity 
instances", not to "entity classes". 
 
 
 
4.2 Nice-to-Have Objectives 
 
4.2.1 Methods 
 
   Description: SMIng should support a mechanism to define method 
signatures (parameters, return values, exception) that are 
implemented on agents. 
 
NOT ADDRESSED 
 
  
 
4.2.2 Unions 
 
   Description: SMIng should support a standard format for unions. 
 
MET 
 
Unions are built into ASN.1 as the CHOICE type. 
 
 
4.2.3 Float Data Types 
 
   Description: SMIng should support the base data types Float32, 
Float64, Float128. 
 
MET 
 
 
 
4.2.4 Comments 
 
   Description: The syntax of comments should be well defined, 
unambiguous and intuitive to most people, e.g., the C++/Java `//' 
syntax. 
 
MET 
 
C-style comments (/* */) are available in the current version of 
ASN.1 besides traditional double-hyphen comments.

Internet Draft           ASN.1 for SMIng        November 13, 2001 
   Description: PIB and MIB row attributes reference a group of 
entries in another table.  SPPI formalizes this by introducing PIB-
TAG and PIB-REFERENCES clauses.  This functionality should be 
retained in SMIng. 
 
NOT ADDRESSED 
 
 
4.2.6 Arrays 
 
   Description: SMIng should allow the definition of a SEQUENCE OF 
attributes or attribute groups (Section 4.1.27). 
 
MET 
 
Arrays can be specified as SEQUENCE OFs at any level of nesting, in 
the definition of any arbitrarily-complex data structure. Names (in 
the form of OBJECT IDENTIFIERs) can be assigned to all the attribute 
instances.  
 
Three naming schemes are provided, allowing both flexibility and 
compatibility with existing practice or applications. 
 
(Example to be included) 
 
 
 
4.2.7 Internationalization 
 
   Description: Informational text (DESCRIPTION, REFERENCE, ...) 
should allow internationalized encoding, probably UTF-8. 
 
MET 
 
The UTF8String built-in type of ASN.1 is used as the base character-
string type in this proposal. 
 
 
4.2.8 Separate Data Modelling from Management Protocol Mapping 
 
   Description: It should be possible to separate the domain 
specific data modelling work from the network management protocol 
specific work.

   Description: Reality sucks.  All information expressed in SMIng 
may not be directly translatable to a MIB or PIB construct, but all 
information should be able to be conveyed in documentation or via 
other mechanisms. 
 
NOT ADDRESSED 
 
 
4.3.2 Attribute Value Constraints 
 
   Description: SMIng should provide mechanisms to formally specify 
constraints between values of multiple attributes. 
 
MET  
 
Constraints between attribute values can be specified in ASN.1 by 
using "component relation" constraints within SEQUENCEs. 
 
(Example to be included) 
 
 
4.3.3 Attribute Transaction Constraints 
 
   Description: SMIng should provide a mechanism to formally express 
that certain sets of attributes can only be modified in combination.

4.3.4 Method Constraints 
 
   Description: Method definitions should provide constraints on

4.3.9 Association Cardinalities 
 
   Description: Cardinalities between associations should be 
formally defined. 
 
NOT ADDRESSED 
 
 
4.3.10 Categories of Modules 
 
   Description: The SMIng documents should give clear guidance on 
which kind of information (with respect to generality, 
type/attribute group/extension/..) should be put in which kind of a 
module. 
 
NOT ADDRESSED 
 
 
4.3.11 Mapping Modules to Files 
 
   Description: There should be a clear statement how SMIng modules 
are mapped to files (1:1, n:1?) and how files should be named (by 
module name in case of 1:1 mapping?). 
 
NOT ADDRESSED 
 
 
4.3.12 Simple Grammar 
 
   Description: The grammar of the language should be as simple as 
possible.  It should be free of exception rules.  A measurement of 
simplicity is shortness of the ABNF grammar.

4.3.13 Place of Module Information 
 
   Description: Module specific information (organization, contact, 
description, revision information) should be bound to the module 
itself and not to an artificial node (like SMIv2 MODULE-IDENTITY). 
 
MET 
 
(Example to be included) 
 
  
4.3.14 Module Namespace 
 
   Description: Currently the namespace of modules is flat and there 
is no structure in module naming causing the potential risk of name 
clashes. 
 
MET 
 
Modules in ASN.1 are assigned both a name and (optionally) an OBJECT 
IDENTIFIER. By assigning OBJECT IDENTIFIERs to modules, it is 
possible to give a hierarchical structure to module naming.  
 
(Example to be included) 
 
 
4.3.15 Hyphens in Identifiers 
 
   Description: There has been some confusion whether hyphens are 
allowed in SMIv2 identifiers: Module names are allowed to contain 
hyphens.  Node identifiers usually are not.  But for example `mib- 
2' is a frequently used identifier that contains a hyphen due to its 
SMIv1 origin, when hyphen were not disallowed.  Similarly, a number 
of named numbers of enumeration types contain hyphens violating an 
SMIv2 rule. SMIng should simply allow hyphens in all kinds of 
identifiers.  No exceptions. 
 
MET  
 
ASN.1 allows hyphens in names, as well as arbitrarily-long names. 
The existing ASN.1 tools already solve the problem of mapping any 
ASN.1 names into identifiers that comply with the rules of any 
particular programming language. 
 
 
 
Intellectual Property  
 
The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any 
intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to  
pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in 
this document or the extent to which any license under such rights 
might or might not be available; neither does it represent that it

Internet Draft           ASN.1 for SMIng        November 13, 2001 
has made any effort to identify any such rights.  Information on the 
IETF's procedures with respect to rights in standards-track and 
standards-related documentation can be found in BCP-11.  Copies of 
claims of rights made available for publication and any assurances 
of licenses to be made available, or the result of an attempt made 
to obtain a general license or permission for the use of such 
proprietary rights by implementors or users of this specification 
can be obtained from the IETF Secretariat. The IETF invites any 
interested party to bring to its attention any copyrights, patents 
or patent applications, or other proprietary rights which may cover 
technology that may be required to practice this standard.  Please 
address the information to the IETF Executive Director.  
 
 
Security Considerations  
 
This document proposes the use of the ASN.1 language to describe 
structures of management information, and presents an ASN.1 module 
where a set of constructs serving that purpose are defined. The 
adoption of ASN.1 and the use of the module have, by themselves, no 
security impact on the Internet.
