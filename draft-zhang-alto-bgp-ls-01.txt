Internet-Draft              ALTO using BGP-LS                  July 2020


1.  Introduction

   The major component of the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
   (ALTO) [RFC7285] deployment is the network information collection.
   [RFC7971] discussed multiple options to collect the network
   information from the inter-domain networks.

   To collection the related network information for ALTO, the following
   high-level questions should be considered:

   *  Can the ALTO service realistically discover that information?

   *  Is the distribution of that information allowed by the operators
      of that service?

   *  Is it information that a client cannot find easily some other way?

   The Border Gateway Protocol - Link State (BGP-LS) extension [RFC7752]
   is one of the popular options and has been deployed in many
   Autonomous Systems (ASes) in recent years [TODO: Need some
   reference].

   BGP-LS enables ALTO server to provide underlay inter-domain topology
   information using the link-state information in IGP domains.

   To leverage BGP-LS to generate ALTO information effectively, some
   requirements for deployment should be considered.

   This document discusses these requirements and the corresponding
   deployment considerations.

   Additionally, this document describes some inter-domain scenarios to
   test the deployment.

2.  New Problem Statement and Working Items

   This document was initially written to summarize ALTO deployment
   consideration using BGP-LS.  However, authors are finding new
   interesting practical problems when pushing the deployment to large-
   scale ISP networks.

   Authors identify two problems:

   Problem 1: how to efficiently obtain fine-grained global ALTO
   information from multiple networks?

   Problem 2: how to efficiently reconstruct and disseminate the ALTO
   information upon dynamics?

Internet-Draft              ALTO using BGP-LS                  July 2020


   Considering the scale of the ISP carrier networks and the frequency
   of network dynamicity, the previous design cannot survive.  We have
   to target a systemtic design to support (1) distributed information
   collection, and (2) calculation and incremental information
   recomputation.

   Thus, authors propose a hierarchical architecture to deploy ALTO
   servers.  To make the deployment in different small networks
   compatible with each other, the interfaces to allow interoperations
   between different ALTO servers are required.  Although we can design
   and implement those interfaces outside the scope of ALTO, we believe
   making ALTO provide this capability by itself can be a more coherent
   approach and also have more potential benefits.

   We are still heavily working on the initial specification.  No more
   details are added in the current document.  But we have already done
   a paper submission to talk about the initial design.  For people
   interested in this work, please feel free to contact us.

3.  Background

3.1.  ALTO Inter-domain Deployment Problem

   [RFC7971] discusses considerations of ALTO deployment in different
   network scenarios.  The inter-domain network is the most common
   scenario to deploy ALTO.

   In practice, the following approaches are used to collect information
   from the network:

   *  Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs, e.g., OSPF, IS-IS): intra-domain
      topology, link weights

   *  Border Gateway Protocol (BGP): inter-domain topology, prefixes, AS
      numbers, AS distances, or other BGP metrics

   *  Network Management Protocols (NMPs, e.g., SNMP, Netconf): latency,
      utilization, bandwidth

3.2.  BGP-LS Background and Benefits for ALTO

   BGP-LS [RFC7752] is designed to allow a BGP speaker to advertise the
   link state database (LSDB) or traffic engineering database (TED) of
   its connected IGP area.

   BGP-LS defines a new address family, link state, in the BGPv4
   framework [RFC4271].

Internet-Draft              ALTO using BGP-LS                  July 2020


   Using BGP-LS, the ALTO server can communicate to only BGP speakers to
   collect all those information.

3.3.  ALTO Deployment Problem using BGP-LS

   A simple deployment solution is to connect the ALTO server as a BGP
   reflector client of every BGP speakers in the network.  However, this
   solution is expensive and redundant.  And because of the BGP updates,
   the ALTO server could receive a lot of inconsistent redundant
   informaiton.  To avoid the redundancy and inconsistency of the
   collected information, a deployment solution should be minimal.

   To understand what is a minimal solution to deploy ALTO using BGP-LS,
   the following questions are raised:

   *  Is it necessary to connect the ALTO server to every AS within a
      BGP session?

   *  Does the session between the ALTO server and each AS have to
      enable BGP-LS?

   *  If using BGP-LS, can the number of necessary BGP sessions be
      reduced?

   The following example shows a minimal deployment in a simple example
   topology.

   Consider the following AS-level topology as an example.  Assuming all
   the BGP sessions between ASes have enabled BGP-LS, the BGP speaker on
   AS B can received the IGP topologies from all the three ASes.  Thus,
   to make sure the ALTO server collect all the inter-domain and intra-
   domain topology information, the minimal deployment could be to set
   up the the ALTO server as a BGP reflector of the BGP speaker on AS B.

   +--------+   +--------+   +---------+
   | AS A   |---| AS B   |---| AS C    |
   +--------+   +--------+   +---------+

        |        /
        |       /

Internet-Draft              ALTO using BGP-LS                  July 2020


   However, it is not enough for collecting the routing information.  As
   the BGP is a destination-based routing protocol, AS B could not
   receive the routing information between endpoints from AS A and AS C.
   To get the missing routing information, the ALTO server should also
   connect read the BGP RIB of AS A or AS C at least.

   As the result, the minimal solution is to establish a BGP session to
   AS B with BGP-LS and another BGP session to AS A (or AS C) without
   BGP-LS.

   The following part of this document will discuss how to achieve the
   minimal ALTO deployment using BPG-LS in detail.  Specifically, two
   questions are required to be answered:

   *  Which BGP speakers are required to be connected to the ALTO
      server?

   *  Which BGP sessions are required to enable BGP-LS?

4.  Requirements for Deploying ALTO in the Inter-domain Scenario using
    BGP-LS

4.1.  Basic Requirements

   The following basic requirements are required by ALTO inter-domain
   deployment in any case.

   Req 1: The ALTO server MUST be able to collect topology information
   from multiple IGP areas.

   Req 2: The ALTO server MUST be able to collect routing information
   for any pairs of endpoints.

   Req 3: The ALTO server MUST be able to collect performance metrics
   across routes.

4.2.  BGP-LS specific Requirements

   The following additional requirements are required by ALTO deployment
   when using BGP-LS.

   Req 4: The ALTO server SHOULD only communicate with necessary BGP
   speakers.

   Req 5: The ALTO server SHOULD only enable BGP-LS advertisement in
   necessary BGP sessions between BGP speakers.

5.  ALTO Deployment Considerations using BGP-LS

   This section discusses some deployment considerations about how to
   address the basic requirements (Req 1-3) when satisfying the BGP-LS
   specific requirements (Req 4-5).

5.1.  Provisioning of Topology Information

   As BGP-LS advertisement cannot be propagated to remote the remote
   ASes, each BGP speaker can only discover directly peered IGP
   topologies using BGP-LS.

   To satisfy Req 4, the ALTO server should only communicate to transit
   networks or IXPs using BGP-LS.  As the IGP topology of a stub network
   can always be discovered by its peered transit networks or IXPs, so
   it is not necessary to communicate with the stub network.

   Specifically, the ALTO server should find a minimal BGP speaker set
   whose peered networks can cover all IGP domains.

5.2.  Provisioning of Routing Information

   As BGP is a destination-based routing protocol, a stub network can
   receive all the inter-domain routing information from all the
   reachable destinations via BGP.

   Thus, to satisfy Req 4, the ALTO server should only communicate to
   stub networks using BGP, as the inter-domain routing information from
   the transit networks is not necessary.

   Assuming the ALTO server has already collected the complete topology
   information using BGP-LS, the ALTO server will have the LSDB of every
   IGP domain.

   To satisfy Req 5, all the BGP sessions connected to the stub networks
   do not have to enable BGP-LS.

5.3.  Provisioning of Performance Metric Information

   TBD.

   To generate a network map, one or more BGP RIBs that could provide
   the topology information MUST specified.  Each BGP RIB MAY include a
   pre-computed topology from the RIB, and an option indicating if the
   BPG-LS is enabled.

   The "inspect-igp" option in the "first-hop-cluster-algorithm" field
   indicates if the ALTO server exposes information about the IGP
   topologies.  If it is true, the ALTO server will inspect all the IGP
   topolgies from the BGP RIBs that enalbe BGP-LS (whose "bgp-ls" option
   is true).

      +rw cost-metric                  alto-types:cost-metric
      +rw (params)?

   To generate a cost map, besides the dependent network map, one or
   more alternative BGP RIBs could be specified to provide necessary
   routing information to the ALTO server.
