  Abstract 
      
     The goal of Internet Unified Messaging is to provide, over the Internet, 
     a single infrastructure, mailbox, and set of interfaces for a user to 
     get, respond to, and manipulate all of his or her messages from a 
     collection of clients with varying capabilities, no matter what the media 
     or source is.  Towards this goal, this document considers what is 
     required of Internet messaging protocols to enable the support of Unified 
     Messaging on limited capability messaging clients.  Two examples of 
     limited capability clients are those limited to having a telephone user 
     interface (TUI) and those that can be supported by small hand-held 
     wireless devices with simple displays such as cell phones with data 
     features and wireless-enabled PDAs (WUI). Included in the discussion is 
     also a list of general principles to guide the design of Unified 
     Messaging protocols.

  1. Introduction 
      
     Historically, a number of separate electronic messaging systems 
     originated and evolved independently for different messaging modes. E.g.  
      
        o Voice mail systems utilized a client with a telephone-based or an 
          answering machine style of user interface.  The telephone network 
          was used for transport of voice messages.  
        o Fax store-and-forward users interface with a fax machine using a 
          modified telephone based interface.  Fax machines also utilized the 
          telephone network for transport.  
        o Users interact with e-mail systems using clients supporting a 
          variety of computer based interfaces running from single command 
          lines to full graphical user interfaces (GUIs).  When e-mail systems 
          began, they transported only text messages over the Internet. 
         
     Nowadays it is not uncommon for individuals to have to separately contend 
     with all of these systems possibly further complicated by having a number 
     of accounts on each.   
      
     IETF e-mail standards have evolved to support additional/merged 
     functionality: 
      
        o First e-mail transport was enhanced to carry any kind of digital 
          data 
        o E-mail transport was enhanced so that properly enabled voice mail 
          systems and fax machines could use the e-mail infrastructure to 
          carry their messages over the Internet as an alternative to the 
          telephone network.  These enhancements were such that the userÆs 
          experience of reliability, security and responsiveness were not 
          diminished by transport over the Internet 
        o Fax messages could be delivered by the e-mail infrastructure to 
          properly enabled e-mail clients for presentation. As well, properly 
          enabled e-mail clients could generate and present voice messages to 
          be received and delivered by the e-mail infrastructure 
      
     These successes in supporting what were separate client types by the 
     common e-mail infrastructure through the use of Internet mail profiles 
     have encouraged the vision of Internet Unified Messaging. 
      
     The goal of Internet Unified Messaging is to provide, over the Internet, 
     a single infrastructure, mailbox, and set of interfaces for a user to 
     get, respond to, and manipulate all of his or her messages from a 
     collection of clients with varying capabilities, no matter what the media 
     or source is. 
      
     We would like to move closer to achieving this goal by evolving toward 
     support for a greater variety of client types. The Internet is evolving 
     toward the support of new devices less powerful than traditional 
     computers as hosts for messaging clients (e.g., PDAs, cellular phones, 
     tablet computers, etc.) These hosts are less powerful both in processing 
     power and display capabilities. They may also be connected to the network 
     by wireless links whose bandwidth is lower and latency longer than

     traditional wire-line links. The purpose of this document is to specify 
     requirements on enhancing the IETF e-mail protocols to support these 
     terminal types. In particular, requirements will be specified for: 
      
        o A TUI (telephone based client with telephone user interface)  
        o A WUI.  We will refer to a client based on a cellular phone or 
          wireless enabled PDA as having a wireless user interface (WUI). 
         
     The rest of this document is structured as follows: 
      
        o A brief survey of IETF e-mail standards and their evolution 
        o A brief survey of messaging profiles û both existing and yet to be 
          defined 
        o A list of principles to be used to guide the design of Internet 
          Unified Messaging 
        o Detailed requirements on Internet mail protocols to support TUIs and 
          WUIs.

  2. Internet Mail and Messaging 
      
     This section reviews very briefly protocols supporting the existing 
     architecture for Internet Mail.  
   
      
  2.1. Mail Server 
      
     [RFC2821] specifies the most recent version (a result of the DRUMS WG) of 
     SMTP, which is the transport protocol between messaging servers.  This 
     document includes a description of the extension model for the SMTP 
     protocol. 
      
      
            |------|                               |------| 
            |email |           (E)SMTP             |email | 
            |server|-------------------------------|server| 
            |      |                               |      | 
            |------|                               |------| 
      
        (E)SMTP: (Extended) Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (server-server) 
      
  2.2. Message Format 
      
     [RFC2822] gives the current message and header format. A series of five 
     MIME RFCs [RFC2045 to RFC2049] extend the Internet mail system to allow 
     the transport of general media beyond just restricted text including 
     contents generated by other applications. It also allows messages to have 
     multi-part bodies consisting of mixed media types. 
   
      
  2.3. Client Access 
      
     Messaging clients retrieve messages from messaging servers using either 
     the POP3 [RFC1939] or the IMAP4 [RFC2060] protocols. The POP3 protocol 
     assumes simple message delivery functionality on the part of the mail 
     server.  IMAP4 requires that the server can act as a remote store of 
     messages for a client.  This is an important feature for diverse client 
     support.  The message store is in the form of multiple mailboxes that the 
     client can manipulate.  Neither protocol defines message posting, which 
     is specified by SMTP (client-server).  Web based clients use http 
     [RFC2616] for message retrieval.

  3. Profiles 
      
     A variety of client and server types other than traditional email can be 
     supported. The clients may be adapted for host restrictions such as 
     limited processing power, message store, display window size, etc. 
     Alternatively clients may be adapted for different functionality (e.g. 
     voice mail, fax, etc.).  Servers may support optional mail features that 
     would allow better handling of different media ((e.g. voice mail, fax, 
     video, etc.).  A useful way to group features that would be important to 
     support for a particular application is to define an Internet Mail 
     profile for that application. 
      
  3.1. Existing Profiles 
      
  3.1.1. Voice Messaging (VPIMv2) 
      
     These profiles [RFC2421 to RFC2424] enable the transport of voice 
     messages using the Internet mail system. The main driver for this work 
     was support of IP transport for voice mail systems. As voice mail clients 
     are accustomed to a higher degree of responsiveness and certainty as to 
     message delivery, the functionality added by VPIMv2 includes Message 
     Disposition Notification and Delivery Status Message as well as the 
     addition of voice media to multi-part message bodies. 
      
  3.1.2. Fax 
      
     This set of profiles [RFC2301 to RFC2306] enables the transport of fax 
     using Internet mail protocols. This work defined the image/tiff MIME 
     type. Support for fax clients also required extensions to Message 
     Delivery Notification. 
   
   
  3.1.3. GUI 
   
     Conventional e-mail clients on computers are generally GUI based. Clients 
     on todayÆs powerful systems can support a wide variety of multimedia. In 
     particular they can handle both voice and fax messages as shown in [IVM] 
     and [RFC2305] respectively.

  3.2. Profile Issues 
      
  3.2.1. TUI 
      
     Traditional voice messaging clients have telephone-based (TUI) clients. 
     Since a POTS phone is a totally dumb terminal, almost all of the 
     messaging client functionality has to be provided by a user agent hosted 
     by a computer networked to the Internet mail server. The main 
     architectural difference between a conventional voice mail system and a 
     unified messaging system is that the voice messaging system uses a 
     specialized message store which is in most cases co-located on the same 
     host as the TUI user agents while a unified messaging system has to use 
     the generic Internet mail message store. The problem then is to be able 
     to, in real time, stream message objects from the message store to the 
     user interface component. The client/UA communicates with the Internet 
     Mail server through three protocols each of which might need enhancement: 
      
        o Message delivery (mail retrieval) e.g. POP3 or IMAP4 
        o Message posting (mail submission) SMTP (client-server) 
        o Message arrival notification

  3.2.2. WUI 
      
     Wireless-based (WUI) clients (e.g. wireless enabled PDAs, cell phones, 
     etc.) can be considered in an analogous manner to the TUI above.  
     However, the WUI offers the potential of simultaneous voice and data

                             UM Requirements                 March 2003 
   
     (with a limited screen size) interfaces that leads to a more complex 
     architecture.  Architecturally, the WUI client can be considered the 
     union of the TUI client with a simple GUI client with two user agent 
     components. See below. UA1 helps maintain the text display while UA2 acts 
     on behalf of the TUI functionality. The existence of UA2 is predicated on 
     the assumption that the client host processor power and radio channel 
     bandwidth are insufficient to handle the voice processing needed for text 
     recognition or text to speech. Otherwise the situation reverts to the GUI 
     one.  
      
     The situation is perhaps simpler: It is very unlikely that separate 
     radios would be used for carriage of the voice-band and client access 
     links below. In this case the overhead of funneling UA1Æs messages 
     through UA2 would be minimized and at the same time UA2 can maintain the 
     consistency of the client state shared between UA1 and UA2. If this is 
     the case, the WUI profile reverts to the TUI situation affecting the same 
     three protocols as before. 
      
     The extended mail client access protocol has an opportunity to be the 
     application level protocol to be used over the air to the wireless 
     device. Other architectures have proposed the use of more wireless 
     specific message formats and/or application level protocols. See for 
     instance [MMS] (this presentation overviews the 3GPP approach to a 
     Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS)).  To handle Internet Mail, this 
     service requires messages to be transformed from native formats into 
     specialized formats and protocols.

  4. General Principles 
      
     This is a list of principles to guide the design of Unified Messaging 
     systems and protocols. 
      
      
  4.1. Protocol Conservation 
      
  4.1.1. Reuse Existing Protocols 
      
     To the extent feasible, the unified messaging framework SHOULD use 
     existing protocols whenever possible.   
       
      
  4.1.2. Maintain Existing Protocol Integrity 
      
     In meeting requirement 4.1, the unified messaging framework MUST NOT 
     redefine the semantics of an existing protocol. 
      
     Said differently, we will not break existing protocols. 
   
   
  4.2. Sensible Reception/Sending Context 
      
  4.2.1. Reception Context 
      
     When the user receives a message, that message SHOULD receive the 
     treatment expected by the sender.  For example, if the sender believes he 
     is sending a voice message, voice message semantics should prevail to the 
     extent that the receiving client can support such treatment. 
      
      
  4.2.2. Sending Context 
      
     When the user sends a message, he SHOULD be able to specify the message 
     context.  That is, whether the network should treat the message as an 
     Internet Mail message, voice message, video message, etc. Again, this can 
     only be complied with to the extent that the infrastructure and receiving 
     client can provide such treatment. In practice, this would imply that the 
     message should be in the form desired by the sender up to delivery to the 
     receiving client. 
      
      
  4.3. Internet Infrastructure Preservation 
      
     A major goal for the unified messaging framework is to not change any 
     existing Internet infrastructure.  For example, the behavior of mail 
     transfer agents (MTAs) should not change.  Likewise, the behavior of 
     existing mail clients should not change. 
      
     Messages created in a unified messaging context MUST NOT require changes 
     to existing mail clients.  However, there may be a loss in service in 
     certain circumstances.

                             UM Requirements                 March 2003 
   
      
     The unified messaging framework MUST be able to handle messages created 
     in a non-unified messaging context, for example, a simple, [RFC 822] text 
     message. 
      
      
  4.4. Voice Requirements (enhanced security and near real-
      time delivery) 
      
     The expectation of voice mail users are described in [IVM] and [RFC3458].  
     To summarize, voice mail users have heightened expectations of privacy, 
     delivery confirmation, and addressing than Internet Mail users. 
      
     On the retrieval side, there are significant real-time requirements for 
     retrieving a message for voice playback.  More than any other media type, 
     including video, voice is extremely sensitive to variations in playback 
     latency.  The unified messaging framework MUST address the real-time 
     needs of voice. 
      
      
  4.5. Fax Requirements (guaranteed delivery) 
      
     Fax users have a particular expectation that is a challenge for unified 
     messaging.  When a person sends a fax, their expectation is the user has 
     received the message upon successful transmission.  This clearly is not 
     the case for Internet Mail. 
      
     OPEN ISSUE: How will we address this? 
     OPEN ISSUE: Do we need to address this? 
      
      
  4.6. Video Requirements (scalable message size) 
      
     Video mail has one outstanding feature: Video messages are large!  The 
     unified messaging framework MUST scale for very large messages.

  5. Security Considerations 
   
     Security will be a very important part of unified messaging.  In addition 
     to the security issues present in Internet Mail, people have higher 
     expectations for Voice and Fax messaging.  The goal, wherever possible, 
     is to preserve the semantics of existing messaging systems and meet the 
     expectations of users with respect to security and reliability.

  6. Detailed Requirements and Issues: TUI 
      
      
  6.1. Requirements on the client access (message delivery, 
      mail retrieval) protocol 
   
     Since IMAP4 is the closest existing IETF protocol in functionality to 
     what is desired, a detailed discussion in the IMAP context will be 
     presented after a general statement of the requirement. 
   
   
  6.1.1. Performance Issues 
   
  6.1.1.1.        Real-Time Playback 
   
     The real-time playback of a voice message must be supported so that the 
     user experience does not differ noticeably from that of a conventional 
     voice messaging system. Possible solutions for this include making use of 
     the existing incremental download capability of the IMAP client access 
     protocol, or utilizing alternate streaming protocols. This not as 
     difficult a protocol problem if the UA host is sufficiently powerful and 
     the bandwidth between it and the server is sufficiently great.  A simple 
     complete download and buffering scheme may produce acceptable results.  
      
     IMAP Context 
      
     The IMAP protocol itself does not provide streaming in the strict 
     definition of the term.  It does provide for the incremental download of 
     content in blocks.  Most IMAP clients do not support this behavior and 
     instead download the entire contents into a temporary file to be passed 
     to the application.      
      
     There are several approaches to achieve real-time playback.  The first 
     approach is to implement an IMAP client that can pass data incrementally 
     to the application as it is received from the network. The application 
     can then read bytes from the network as needed to maintain a play buffer 
     and not require the full download of contents.  This approach may require 
     server-side development to efficiently support partial download.  (Avoid 
     re-opening file and seeking to requested pointer)  
      
     Alternately, the proposed IMAP channel extension can be used by the 
     client to request that the servers make the selected content available 
     via an alternate transport mechanism.  In this way a client can ask the 
     server to make the voice data available to the client via a streaming 
     media protocol such as RTSP.  This requires support on the client and 
     server of a common streaming protocol.  
      
     Third, given sufficient bandwidth between client and back-end data store, 
     an implementation may download the entire contents before playing without 
     noticeable latency.  Combined with client-side caching to avoid re-
     fetches, this strategy may work with existing message servers.

                             UM Requirements                 March 2003 
   
     It is clear that a choice be made common to the server and the client to 
     provide this functionality. 
      
      
  6.1.1.2.        Avoid Base-64 Data Inflation 
      
     Another possible performance optimization is allowing for the transport 
     of data using more efficient native coding rather than the text-like 
     "base 64" encoding. 
      
     IMAP context 
      
     Standard IMAP4 uses a text-based data representation scheme where all 
     data is represented in a form that looks like text, that is, voice data 
     must be encoded using "base 64" into a transport encoding that adds 30% 
     to the size of a message.  When downloading or appending messages to the 
     server, substantial additional bandwidth is utilized. 
      
     Proposed Solutions: 
      
     Where IMAP channel is appropriate, the external channel may be binary 
     capable; that is; the external access may not require re-encoding.  Such 
     mechanisms as HTTP, FTP, or RTSP are available for this download.  
      
     The IMAP binary extension standards proposal extends the IMAP fetch 
     command to retrieve data in the binary form.  This is especially useful 
     for large attachments and other binary components.  Binary in conjunction 
     with a streaming client implementation may be an attractive alternative 
     to the Channel extension.  
       
      
  6.1.2. Functional Issues 
      
  6.1.2.1.        Mailbox Summary Support 
   
     The common TUI prompt, "you have two new voice messages, six unheard 
     messages, and one new fax message" requires more information than is 
     conveniently made available by current client access protocols.  The 
     existing IMAP protocolÆs mailbox status command does not include a count 
     by message type (message context). A possible solution is have the mail 
     server keep track of these current counters and provide a status command 
     that returns an arbitrary mailbox summary. An alternate solution is one 
     that involves refining the mail server mailbox semantics as to include by 
     convention a number mailboxes (folders) corresponding to message types. 
   
     IMAP Context 
   
     IMAP does not provide a convenient command. The IMAP status command 
     provides a count of new and total messages with standardized attributes 
     extracted from the message headers.  This pre-determined information does 
     not include information about the message type.  Without defined 
     conventions to the status command, a client would have to download the

                             UM Requirements                 March 2003 
   
     header for each message to determine its type.  (Are flags made available 
     through the list command?  Or do they need to be queried independently?)  
   
     There are standards activities directed toward defining an extensible 
     mechanism for sending arbitrary message summary data in the LIST command 
     [reference] or the status counters extension [reference].  With proper 
     MTA support for the necessary message-context attribute and support for 
     reading the flags, a single command can extract enough data to count the 
     messages in various categories.   For adequate performance, the MTA must 
     pre-parse the messages to extract the necessary information into an index 
     for this request as messages are deposited.  
   
     Without the standards, it is possible to use multiple virtual folders to 
     achieve similar functionality.  The "inbox" can be sub-divided into 
     virtual unheard, new, unheard fax, and new fax message sub-folders.  A 
     folder status command issued against each sub-folder would yield the 
     appropriate count.  An MTA may implement these as truly separate folders 
     or may present these as virtual folders to the client while storing the 
     messages in a single inbox.  
    
   
  6.1.2.2.        Sort by Message Context Support  
   
     This functionality is required to present new voice messages first and 
     then new fax messages within a single logical queue as voice mailboxes 
     commonly do. Again this is a question of convenience and performance. 
     Adequate performance may only be possible if the mail server provides a 
     sort by context or maintains a set of virtual mailboxes (folders) 
     corresponding to message types as for Mailbox Summary Support. 
      
     IMAP Context 
      
     IMAP does not support this directly. A straightforward solution is to 
     define an extensible sort mechanism for sorting on arbitrary header 
     contents.  
      
     An alternative is for the client to download the headers of all messages 
     and perform a local sort.  This works where mailboxes have fewer than a 
     couple-dozen messages.  
      
     A further alternative uses separate virtual folders to hold messages of 
     different types and status, using the client to construct the expected 
     user experience. 
      
      
  6.1.2.3.        Quota by Message Context Support  
   
     Voice mail systems' mailboxes commonly contain voice and fax messages. 
     Sometimes, such systems also support E-mail messages (text, text with 
     attachments) in addition to voice messages. Similarly to the requirement 
     for sort by message context -- quota management is also required per 
     message context.

     One possible use case is to prevent multiple (large) messages of one type 
     (e.g. E-mail messages) to consume all available quota so that messages of 
     other type (e.g. voice or fax messages) cannot be further deposited to 
     the mailbox. 
      
     IMAP Context 
      
     Again IMAP does not support this directly. One solution is to define an 
     extension to the QUOTA IMAP command to support multiple message contexts. 
     (In addition, there is a parallel effort to enhance the SMTP SIZE 
     extension for the same purpose). 
   
  6.1.2.4.        Status of Multiple Mailboxes Support 
   
     Extension mailbox support requires the ability to efficiently status a 
     mailbox other than the one currently logged into.  This facility is 
     required to support sub-mailboxes, where a common feature is to check 
     whether other sub-mailboxes in the same family group have new messages.   
      
     IMAP Context  
      
     Current mechanisms are limited to logging into each of set of mailboxes, 
     checking status, logging out, and repeating until all sub-mailboxes are 
     used. 
      
      
  6.1.2.5.        Specialized Mailbox Support 
   
     Applications that provide features such as check receipt, deleted message 
     recovery, resave, and others require the ability to access messages in 
     pre-determined mailboxes with specific behaviors. (E.g. Outbox, Sent 
     Items, Delete Items, Expired items, Drafts)  
      
     IMAP Context 
      
     IMAP provides only a single standardized folder inbox. This functionality 
     does not require new protocol per-se, but standardized usage and naming 
     conventions necessary for interoperability.  It required that the server 
     provide the underlying logic to support these special folders including 
     automatic insertion, scheduled copying, and periodic deletion. 
      
      
  6.1.2.6.        CLID Restriction indication/preservation 
   
     Many calling features are dependent upon collected caller-ID information.  
     Trusted clients such as the TUI, WUI, and WAP may have access to 
     restricted caller-ID information for such purposes as callback.  
     Untrusted clients must not receive this information.  A mechanism for 
     communicating "trust" between the client and the server is required to 
     deliver this information to the end-user when appropriate.

     Some IMAP 4 servers can be configured to recognize certain clients by IP 
     address and apply necessary CLID restriction treatment such as hiding 
     addresses where CLI restriction has been indicated in the message.  
      
     For systems operating in a closed network, the system may rely upon 
     serving only trusted clients that protect the identity of the sender 
     based on per-message markings.  This usage requires custom proxies to use 
     for Internet-facing services such as downloads by PC thick-clients.  
       
      
  6.1.2.7.        Greeting Access and Play Support 
   
     Voice messaging systems store multiple audio greetings files per user to 
     play upon answering the phone.  This information is logically directory 
     information, but the size, access patterns, and streaming requirements 
     exceed the capabilities of more directory access protocols and underlying 
     servers.  
      
     IMAP Context 
      
     Rather than create a new specialized store, it is common to store  
     greetings as messages in a hidden or special folder.  As such, it is 
     natural to use the IMAP protocol for access and update of these 
     greetings.  This provides the ability to update the greeting easily using 
     the IMAP command.  
      
     Access to the greetings requires a form of super-user access to log into 
     the called party mailbox and extract the greeting.   Through conventions, 
     a given server or set of servers identified by IP address or login 
     password may be granted privileged access to the mailbox contents.  
      
      
  6.1.2.8.        Support for Committed Message Delivery 
   
     Voice messaging service has provided a high degree of reliability and 
     performance for telephone answering messages.  The expectation is that 
     once the caller has hung-up, the messages is in the mailbox and available 
     for review.  Traditional Internet mail architecture suggests these 
     messages should be sent to the mailbox via SMTP.  This approach has two 
     limitations.  The first and most manageable is that the message 
     forwarding may take more time than is tolerable by the subscriber.  The 
     second is that the message may fail to be delivered to the mailbox, and 
     because there is no way to return notice to the caller, the message is 
     "lost". 
      
     IMAP Context 
      
     The standards community is working on an alliterative to SMTP called 
     Local Message Transport Protocol. This protocol addresses a number of 
     limitations in SMTP when used to provide atomic delivery to a mailbox.  
     The failure modes in this proposal are carefully controlled, as are 
     issues of per-message quota enforcement and message storage quota-
     override for designated administrative messages.

     An alternative approach is to misuse the IMAP protocol slightly and use 
     an IMAP append command to deposit a message directly into the 
     subscriber's inbox.  This append must be done by a special super-user 
     with write permissions into the subscribers mailbox.  Further, the 
     message store must be able to trigger notification events upon insertion 
     of a message into the mailbox via the Append command.  The historic 
     limitation on using IMAP4 for message sending involves the inability of 
     IMAP to communicate a full SMTP envelope.  For telephone answering, these 
     limitations are not significant.  
   
         
      
  6.1.2.9.        Support for Multiple Access to Mailbox 
   
     If the telephone answering application client uses IMAP4 for greeting 
     access and message deposit, it is essential that the server provide 
     support for simultaneous login.  It is common in voicemail for an 
     incoming call to be serviced by the telephone answering application 
     client at the same time the subscribers is logged into their mailbox.  
     Further, new applications such as WEB and WAP access to voicemail may 
     entail simultaneous login sessions, one from the TUI client and one from 
     the visual client. 
      
     IMAP Context  
      
     The standard does not preclude multiple accesses to a mailbox, but it 
     does not explicitly support this practice.  The lack of explicit support 
     requires the server and client to adhere to a common set of practices and 
     behaviors to avoid undesirable and unpredictable behaviors.  RFC 2180 
     describes a candidate set of conventions necessary to support this 
     multiple-access technique.  It is not a standard. 
   
   
  6.2. Requirements on the message posting (mail submission) 
      protocol 
   
  6.2.1. Forward without Download Support 
   
     It is common to forward messages, or to reply to messages with a copy of 
     the attached content.  Today such forwarding requires the sender to 
     download a complete copy of the original message, attach it to the reply 
     or forward message, and resubmit the result.  For large messages, this 
     represents a substantial amount of bandwidth and processing.  For clients 
     connected via long-thin pipes, alternatives are required. 
      
     One approach is to define an extension to message submission to request 
     the submission server to resolve embedded URL's within a message before 
     relaying the message to the final destination.  
      
      
  6.2.2. Quota by Context Enforcement 
   
    
  Wong            Informational - Expires September 2003              22 








   
                             UM Requirements                 March 2003 
   
     It is common in a unified messaging system to offer separate quotas for 
     each of several message contexts to avoid the condition where a flood of 
     email fills the mailbox and prevents the subscriber from receiving voice 
     messages via the telephone.  It is necessary to extend the protocols to 
     support the reporting of the "mailbox full" status based on the context 
     of the submitted message.  
      
     Clear security issues are involved to prevent the mis-identification of a 
     message context for the purpose of intentionally filling a subscribers 
     mailbox.  It is envisioned that the message submission protocol will 
     support authentication of trusted submission agents authorized to submit 
     distinguished messages.  
   
   
  6.2.3. Future Delivery Support 
   
     Traditionally messages sent with "future delivery" are held in the 
     recipients client "outbox" or equivalent until the appointed submission 
     time.  Thin clients used for WEB or TUI do not have such persistent 
     storage and must rely upon server-based outbox queues.  
      
     Such support requires extensions to message submission protocols to 
     identify a message as requiring queuing for future delivery.  Extensions 
     to IMAP4 or conventions are required to view and manipulate the outbound 
     queue, for such purposes as canceling a future message.  Server support 
     for managing such a queue is required such that message are sent when 
     they are intended.  
   
   
  6.3. Requirements on the message arrival notification 
      protocol 
   
     Voicemail systems traditionally notify subscribers on certain events 
     happening in their mailbox. For example, it is common to send an SMS, or 
     a pager notification for new message arrival, when messages have been 
     read (and are not considered "new" anymore), mailbox full etc.   
      
     When implemented over IMAP-based message stores, voice mail system need 
     to be notified about these events. Furthermore, when other applications 
     are accessing/manipulating the mailbox, it is desirable that a 
     notification component (which is sometimes part of the voicemail 
     application) gets notifications from the message store about these 
     events, so that it can produce the desired user notification.  
      
     The standards community is working on a standard for "Simple Notification 
     and Alarm Protocol (SNAP)" that defines the expected behavior of the 
     message store for various events, much of them triggered by IMAP 
     commands.

  7. Detailed Requirements and Issues: WUI 
      
  7.1. Wireless Considerations on Email 
   
  7.1.1. Transport Considerations 
      
     Compared to a LAN/WAN configuration or even to a wireline dial-up 
     connection, the probability of interruption for a wireless data 
     connection is very high.  
      
     Interruptions can be due to hand-off, signal fading, or stepping beyond 
     cell coverage. 
      
     In addition, since the mobile handset is also used for other types of 
     communications, there is relatively high probability that the data 
     session will be interrupted either by incoming voice calls or by "pushed" 
     messages from services such as SMS, MMS and WAP.  
   
     It is also common in these environments that device IP address change 
     within a session. 
   
   
  7.1.2. Handset-Resident Client Limitations 
      
     Although the capabilities of wireless handsets are rapidly improving, the 
     wireless handset remains limited in its capability to host email clients 
     Currently, email access is restricted to only high-end wireless handsets.   
      
     These limitations include: 
   
        o Client size  
          Handset-resident clients are limited in size because either the 
          handset has limited storage space or the handset vendor / network 
          operator has set a limit on the size of client application that can 
          reside on the handset. 
   
        o Runtime memory 
          Wireless handsets have limited runtime memory for the use of the 
          mobile email client.  
   
        o CPU Speed 
          Wireless handsets have CPUs that are inferior to those in 
          conventional systems (PCs) that run email clients. 
      
        o User Interface 
          Handsets have very limited input and output capabilities. Most of 
          them do not have a keyboard or a pointing device. 
   
      
  7.1.3. Wireless Bandwidth and Network Utilization Considerations 
      
  7.1.3.1.        Low Bandwidth 
      
    
  Wong            Informational - Expires September 2003              24 








   
                             UM Requirements                 March 2003 
   
     2G mobile networks enabled wireless data communications but only at very 
     low bandwidths using circuit-switched data. 2.5G and 3G networks improve 
     on this. However, existing e-mail clients require very large (up to 
     several MBs) files -- encountered in multi-media attachments such as 
     presentations, images and documents -- to be downloaded even though the 
     device can not exploit most of the data (because of color depth and 
     screen size limitations). Transferring such large files over the air is 
     of questionable value even when higher wireless bandwidth is available.  
      
      
  7.1.3.2.        Price Awareness 
      
     In many cases, users of mobile data services are charged by the amount of 
     data (e.g. kilobytes) downloaded to the handset. Most users currently 
     experience a higher per-kilobyte data charge with a wireless service than 
     over a wire-line service. Users are sensitive to the premium for wireless 
     service. This results in an unwillingness to download large amounts of 
     unnecessary data to the handset and the desire to be able to selectively 
     download multimedia content. 
   
      
  7.1.3.3.        File Size Limitations  
      
     In some cases, the size of file -- that can be transmitted over the air 
     to the handset -- is limited. 
   
   
  7.1.4. Content Display Considerations 
      
  7.1.4.1.        Display Size and capabilities 
      
     Wireless terminals are currently limited in their display size, color 
     depth, and ability to present multimedia elements (i.e. if multiple 
     pictures are sent, the mobile can usually present only one reduced-sized 
     picture element at a time rather than the several picture elements at 
     once in the same display that a conventional PC email client would be 
     able to show). Therefore many email attachments destined for a mobile may 
     require changes in size, color depth and presentation method to be 
     suitably displayed. 
   
      
  7.1.4.2.        Supported Media Formats 
      
     Wireless handsets can only display a limited set of media format types. 
     While PC clients support a large variety of document types (and enable 
     on-demand "codec"/player download), mobiles have very limited support. 
     (e.g., most only support WAV audio and cannot play other formats such as 
     AU, MP3 and AIFF.)  Furthermore, although almost all new handsets sold 
     today can display images and sound in some advanced format, support for 
     displaying other media or application-specific formats, such as MS-Office 
     (TM) and Acrobat PDF documents is not expected to be widespread in the 
     near future.

                             UM Requirements                 March 2003 
   
  7.1.4.3.        Handset Type Variety 
      
     As mentioned above, there are many handset types available in the market 
     and each has different display capabilities, screen characteristics and 
     processing capabilities. The mobile email service SHOULD be able to 
     support as many handset types as possible. 
      
  7.1.4.4.        Specific Attachment Display Scenarios 
      
     Handsets are unsuited for perusing entire lengthy documents or 
     presentations. A mobile user is more likely to look at several pages of a 
     document or several slides of a presentation and then take action 
     accordingly (e.g., forward the email message to another recipient, print 
     it, or leave the document for later retrieval from another device) rather 
     than go through the whole document.  
      
     Therefore, there is a need to enable users to download not the entire 
     attachment but rather just a selected PART of it. (e.g., users SHOULD be 
     able to download the ôTable of Contentsö of a document; to search within 
     a document; to download the first slide of a presentation; the next slide 
     of this presentation; a range of slides, etc.) 
   
   
  7.2. Requirements to Enable Wireless Device Support 
       
     The following requirements are derived from the considerations mentioned 
     above.   
   
      
  7.2.1. Transport Requirements 
      
     The mobile email protocol MUST anticipate transient losses of 
     connectivity and allow clients to quickly and easily recover (restore 
     state) from interrupted connections. 
      
     IMAP4 Context 
      
     An IMAP4 connection requires the communication socket to remain up 
     continuously during an email session. In case of transient loss of 
     communications, the connection must be reestablished. It is up to the 
     client to reconnect to the server and return to an equivalent state in 
     the session. This overhead of restoring connections is very costly in 
     response time and additional data transmission. 
      
      
   
  7.2.2. Enhanced Mobile Email Functionality 
      
  7.2.2.1.        Forward Without Fetch 
      
     To minimize the downloading of data over the air, the user MUST be able 
     to forward a message without initially downloading it entirely or at all 
     to the handset. 
    
  Wong            Informational - Expires September 2003              26 








   
                             UM Requirements                 March 2003 
   
      
     The mobile email protocol MUST support the ability to forward a message 
     without retrieving it. 
      
     This requirement is similar to the TUI requirement that is described in 
     section 6.2.1 
      
      
  7.2.2.2.        Media Streaming 
      
     The mobile email protocol MUST provide a solution that will enable media 
     streaming to the wireless handset. 
      
     This requirement is similar to the TUI requirement that is described in 
     section 6.1.1.1 
      
      
  7.2.3. Client Requirements 
   
     IMAP4 clients are large because IMAP4 already consists of a complex set 
     of functions (e.g., parsing of a broad variety of MIME formats).  
      
     The mobile email client SHOULD be: 
     (1) Small in size 
     (2) Efficient in CPU consumption  
     (3) Efficient in runtime memory consumption 
      
     To enable such extremely thin clients, in developing the mobile email 
     protocol we SHOULD consider simplifying the IMAP functionality that 
     handsets need support.  
   
  7.2.4. Bandwidth Requirements 
      
     The mobile email solution SHOULD minimize the amount of data transmitted 
     over the air. One way of pursuing this goal is the use of content 
     transcoding and media adaptation by the server before message retrieval 
     in order to optimize it for the capabilities of the receiving handset.  
      
     Another way is the mobile email protocol itself MUST be made simple and 
     contain as little overhead as possible. 
      
     A third way to minimize the bandwidth usage is described in section 
     6.1.1.2, "Avoid Base-64 Data Inflation". 
      
  7.2.5. Media Handling Requirements 
      
     As described above, wireless devices have limited ability to handle 
     media. Therefore, the server may be have to perform media manipulation 
     activities to enable the terminal to display the data usefully. 
      
  7.2.5.1.        Device Capabilities Negotiation 
      

    
  Wong            Informational - Expires September 2003              27 








   
                             UM Requirements                 March 2003 
   
     In order to correctly support the different characteristics and 
     capabilities of the various handset types available in the market, the 
     mobile email protocol MUST include provision for email content 
     adaptation. For example, the choice of supported file formats, color 
     depth and screen size.  Work on ESMTP transcoding [CONNEG] may address 
     this issue. 
       
      
  7.2.5.2.        Adjusting Message Attachments for Handset Abilities 
      
     To support limited wireless handsets, the server could transcode the 
     message attachments into a representation that is more suitable for that 
     device. This behavior should be based on the device capabilities 
     negotiation as described in 7.2.5.1. For example, a device that cannot 
     display GIF format but only WBMP should get a WBMP image. Devices that 
     cannot display a PDF file should get a text version of the file.  
      
     The handset should control what or any transcoding is desired. It should 
     be able to retrieve the original attachment without any changes. In 
     addition, the device should be able to choose between "flavors" of the 
     transcoding (ôPresent the content as thumbnail imageö is  an example of 
     such a specific media manipulation.) 
      
     Again work on ESMTP transcoding [CONNEG] may address this issue. 
      
  7.2.5.3.        Handling Attachment Parts  
      
     A desirable feature to have (but probably out of scope for the current 
     lemonade charter) is the following:  To enable users to retrieve not only 
     the entire attachment file but also parts of it, the mobile email 
     protocol should include the ability for the retrieving client to specify 
     selected elements of an attachment for download. Such elements can be, 
     for example, specific pages of a document, the ôtable of contentsö of a 
     document or specific slides of a presentation.  Unfortunately, such an 
     application-specific meta-Layer 7 enhancement is unlikely in the short 
     term.
