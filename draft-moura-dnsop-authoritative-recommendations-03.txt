1.  Introduction

   The domain name system (DNS) has main two types of DNS servers:
   authoritative servers and recursive resolvers.  Figure 1 shows their
   relationship.  An authoritative server (ATn in Figure 1) knows the
   content of a DNS zone from local knowledge, and thus can answer
   queries about that zone without needing to query other servers

   [RFC2181].  A recursive resolver (Re_n) is a program that extracts
   information from name servers in response to client requests
   [RFC1034].  A client (stub in Figure 1) refers to stub resolver
   [RFC1034] that is typically located within the client software.

       Figure 1: Relationship between recursive resolvers (Re_n) and
                     authoritative name servers (ATn)

   DNS queries/responses contribute to user's perceived latency and
   affect user experience [Sigla2014], and the DNS system has been
   subject to repeated Denial of Service (DoS) attacks (for example, in
   November 2015 [Moura16b]) in order to degrade user experience.

   To reduce latency and improve resiliency against DoS attacks, DNS
   uses several types of server replication.  Replication at the
   authoritative server level can be achieved with (i) the deployment of
   multiple servers for the same zone [RFC1035] (AT1--AT4 in Figure 1),
   (ii) the use of IP anycast [RFC1546][RFC4786][RFC7094] that allows
   the same IP address to be announced from multiple locations (each of
   them referred to as anycast instance [RFC8499]) and (iii) by using
   load balancers to support multiple servers inside a single
   (potentially anycasted) instance.  As a consequence, there are many
   possible ways an authoritative DNS provider can engineer its
   production authoritative server network, with multiple viable choices
   and no single optimal design.

   This document summarizes recent research work exploring DNS
   configurations and offers specific tangible recommendations to DNS
   authoritative servers operators (DNS operators hereafter).

   [RF:JAb2]], [RF:MSJ1], [RF:DW2].  The recommendations (R1-R6)
   presented in this document are backed by previous research work,
   which used wide-scale Internet measurements upon which to draw their
   conclusions.  This document describes the key engineering options,
   and points readers to the pertinent papers for details.

   [RF:JAb1, Issue#2].  These recommendations are designed for operators
   of "large" authoritative servers for domains like TLDs.  "Large"
   authoritative servers refers to those with a significant global user
   population.  These recommendations may not be appropriate for smaller
   domains, such as those used by an organization with users in one city
   or region, where goals such as uniform low latency are less strict.

   It is likely that these recommendations might be useful in a wider
   context, such as for any stateless/short-duration, anycasted service.
   Because the conclusions of the studies don't verify this fact, the
   wording in this document discusses DNS authoritative services only.

2.  R1: Use equaly strong IP anycast in every authoritative server to
    achieve even load distribution

   Authoritative DNS servers operators announce their authoritative
   servers as NS records[RFC1034].  Different authoritatives for a given
   zone should return the same content, typically by staying
   synchronized using DNS zone transfers (AXFR[RFC5936] and
   IXFR[RFC1995]) to coordinate the authoritative zone data to return to
   their clients.

   DNS heavily relies upon replication to support high reliability,
   capacity and to reduce latency [Moura16b].  DNS has two complementary
   mechanisms to replicate the service.  First, the protocol itself
   supports nameserver replication of DNS service for a DNS zone through
   the use of multiple nameservers that each operate on different IP
   addresses, listed by a zone's NS records.  Second, each of these
   network addresses can run from multiple physical locations through
   the use of IP anycast[RFC1546][RFC4786][RFC7094], by announcing the
   same IP address from each instance and allowing Internet routing
   (BGP[RFC4271]) to associate clients with their topologically nearest
   anycast instance.  Outside the DNS protocol, replication can be
   achieved by deploying load balancers at each physical location.
   Nameserver replication is recommended for all zones (multiple NS
   records), and IP anycast is used by most large zones such as the DNS
   Root, most top-level domains[Moura16b] and large commercial
   enterprises, governments and other organizations.

   Most DNS operators strive to reduce latency for users of their
   service.  However, because they control only their authoritative
   servers, and not the recursive resolvers communicating with those

   servers, it is difficult to ensure that recursives will be served by
   the closest authoritative server.  Server selection is up to the
   recursive resolver's software implementation, and different software
   vendors and releases employ different criteria to chose which
   authoritative servers with which to communicate.

   Knowing how recursives choose authoritative servers is a key step to
   better engineer the deployment of authoritative servers.
   [Mueller17b] evaluates this with a measurement study in which they
   deployed seven unicast authoritative name servers in different global
   locations and queried these authoritative servers from more than 9k
   RIPE Atlas probes and and their respective recursive resolvers.

   In the wild, [Mueller17b] found that recursives query all available
   authoritative servers, regardless of the observed latency.  But the
   distribution of queries tend to be skewed towards authoritatives with
   lower latency: the lower the latency between a recursive resolver and
   an authoritative server, the more often the recursive will send
   queries to that authoritative.  These results were obtained by
   aggregating results from all vantage points and not specific to any
   vendor/version.

   The hypothesis is that this behavior is a consequence of two main
   criteria employed by resolvers when choosing authoritatives:
   performance (lower latency) and diversity of authoritatives, where a
   resolver checks all authoritative servers to determine which is
   closer and to provide alternatives if one is unavailable.

   For a DNS operator, this policy means that latency of all
   authoritatives matter, so all must be similarly capable, since all
   available authoritatives will be queried by most recursive resolvers.
   Since unicast cannot deliver good latency worldwide (a unicast
   authoritative server in Europe will always have high latency to
   resolvers in California, for example, given its geographical
   distance), [Mueller17b] recommends to DNS operators that they deploy
   equally strong IP anycast in every authoritative server (NS record),
   in terms of number of instances and peering, and, consequently, to
   phase out unicast, so they can deliver latency values to global
   clients.  However, [Mueller17b] also notes that DNS operators should
   also take architectural considerations into account when planning for
   deploying anycast [RFC1546].

   This recommendation was deployed at the ".nl" TLD zone, which
   originally had seven authoritative severs (mixed unicast/anycast
   setup). .nl has moved in early 2018 to a setup with 4 anycast
   authoritative name servers.  This is not to say that .nl was the
   first - other zones, have been running anycast only authoritatives
   (e.g., .be since 2013).  [Mueller17b] contribution is to show that



Moura, et al.          Expires September 12, 2019               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft          Recomm-Authoritative-Ops              March 2019


   unicast cannot deliver good latency worldwide, and that anycast has
   to be deployed to deliver good latency worldwide.

3.  R2: Routing Can Matter More Than Locations

   A common metric when choosing an anycast DNS provider or setting up
   an anycast service is the number of anycast instances[RFC4786], i.e.,
   the number of global locations from which the same address is
   announced with BGP.  Intuitively, one could think that more instances
   will lead to shorter response times.

   However, this is not necessarily true.  In fact, [Schmidt17a] found
   that routing can matter more than the total number of locations.
   They analyzed the relationship between the number of anycast
   instances and the performance of a service (latency-wise, RTT) and
   measured the overall performance of four DNS Root servers, namely C,
   F, K and L, from more than 7.9k RIPE Atlas probes.

   [Schmidt17a] found that C-Root, a smaller anycast deployment
   consisting of only 8 instances (they refer to anycast instance as
   anycast site), provided a very similar overall performance than that
   of the much larger deployments of K and L, with 33 and 144 instances
   respectively.  The median RTT for C, K and L Root was between
   30-32ms.

   [Schmidt17a] recommendation for DNS operators when engineering
   anycast services is consider factors other than just the number of
   instances (such as local routing connectivity) when designing for
   performance.  They showed that 12 instances can provide reasonable
   latency, given they are globally distributed and have good local
   interconnectivity.  However, more instances can be useful for other
   reasons, such as when handling DDoS attacks [Moura16b].

4.  R3: Collecting Detailed Anycast Catchment Maps Ahead of Actual
    Deployment Can Improve Engineering Designs

   An anycast DNS service may have several dozens or even more than one
   hundred instances (such as L-Root does).  Anycast leverages Internet
   routing to distribute the incoming queries to a service's distributed
   anycast instances; in theory, BGP (the Internet's defacto routing
   protocol) forwards incoming queries to a nearby anycast instance (in
   terms of BGP distance).  However, usually queries are not evenly
   distributed across all anycast instances, as found in the case of
   L-Root [IcannHedge18].

   Adding new instances to an anycast service may change the load
   distribution across all instances, leading to suboptimal usage of the
   service or even stressing some instances while others remain



Moura, et al.          Expires September 12, 2019               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft          Recomm-Authoritative-Ops              March 2019


   underutilized.  This is a scenario that operators constantly face
   when expanding an anycast service.  Besides, when setting up a new
   anycast service instance, operators cannot directly estimate the
   query distribution among the instances in advance of enabling the new
   instance.

   To estimate the query loads across instances of an expanding service
   or a when setting up an entirely new service, operators need detailed
   anycast maps and catchment estimates (i.e., operators need to know
   which prefixes will be matched to which anycast instance).  To do
   that, [Vries17b] developed a new technique enabling operators to
   carry out active measurements, using aan open-source tool called
   Verfploeter (available at [VerfSrc]).  Verfploeter maps a large
   portion of the IPv4 address space, allowing DNS operators to predict
   both query distribution and clients catchment before deploying new
   anycast instances.

   [Vries17b] shows how this technique was used to predict both the
   catchment and query load distribution for the new anycast service of
   B-Root.  Using two anycast instances in Miami (MIA) and Los Angeles
   (LAX) from the operational B-Root server, they sent ICMP echo packets
   to IP addresses to each IPv4 /24 on the Internet using a source
   address within the anycast prefix.  Then, they recorded which
   instance the ICMP echo replies arrived at based on the Internet's BGP
   routing.  This analysis resulted in an Internet wide catchment map.
   Weighting was then applied to the incoming traffic prefixes based on
   of 1 day of B-Root traffic (2017-04-12, DITL datasets [Ditl17]).  The
   combination of the created catchment mapping and the load per prefix
   created an estimate predicting that 81.6% of the traffic would go to
   the LAX instance.  The actual value was 81.4% of traffic going to
   LAX, showing that the estimation was pretty close and the Verfploeter
   technique was a excellent method of predicting traffic loads in
   advance of a new anycast instance deployment ([Vries17b] also uses
   the term anycast site to refer to anycast instance).

   Besides that, Verfploeter can also be used to estimate how traffic
   shifts among instances when BGP manipulations are executed, such as
   AS Path prepending that is frequently used by production networks
   during DDoS attacks.  A new catchment mapping for each prepending
   configuration configuration: no prepending, and prepending with 1, 2
   or 3 hops at each instance.  Then, [Vries17b] shows that this mapping
   can accurately estimate the load distribution for each configuration.

   An important operational takeaway from [Vries17b] is that DNS
   operators can make informed choices when engineering new anycast
   instances or when expending new ones by carrying out active
   measurements using Verfploeter in advance of operationally enabling
   the fully anycast service.  Operators can spot sub-optimal routing



Moura, et al.          Expires September 12, 2019               [Page 7]

   situations early, with a fine granularity, and with significantly
   better coverage than using traditional measurement platforms such as
   RIPE Atlas.

   To date, Verfploeter has been deployed on B-Root[Vries17b], on a
   operational testbed (Anycast testbed) [AnyTest], and on a large
   unnamed operator.

   The recommendation is therefore to deploy a small test Verfploeter-
   enabled platform in advance at a potential anycast instance may
   reveal the realizable benefits of using that instance as an anycast
   interest, potentially saving significant financial and labor costs of
   deploying hardware to a new instance that was less effective than as
   had been hoped.

5.  R4: When under stress, employ two strategies

   DDoS attacks are becoming bigger, cheaper, and more frequent
   [Moura16b].  The most powerful recorded DDoS attack to DNS servers to
   date reached 1.2 Tbps, by using IoT devices [Perlroth16].  Such
   attacks call for an answer for the following question: how should a
   DNS operator engineer its anycast authoritative DNS server react to
   the stress of a DDoS attack?  This question is investigated in study
   [Moura16b] in which empirical observations are grounded with the
   following theoretical evaluation of options.

   An authoritative DNS server deployed using anycast will have many
   server instances distributed over many networks and instances.
   Ultimately, the relationship between the DNS provider's network and a
   client's ISP will determine which anycast instance will answer
   queries for a given client.  As a consequence, when an anycast
   authoritative server is under attack, the load that each anycast
   instance receives is likely to be unevenly distributed (a function of
   the source of the attacks), thus some instances may be more
   overloaded than others which is what was observed analyzing the Root
   DNS events of Nov. 2015 [Moura16b].  Given the fact that different
   instances may have different capacity (bandwidth, CPU, etc.), making
   a decision about how to react to stress becomes even more difficult.

   In practice, an anycast instance under stress, overloaded with
   incoming traffic, has two options:

   o  It can withdraw or pre-prepend its route to some or to all of its
      neighbors, ([RF:Issue3]) perform other traffic shifting tricks
      (such as reducing the propagation of its announcements using BGP
      communities[RFC1997]) which shrinks portions of its catchment),
      use FlowSpec [RFC5575] or other upstream communication mechanisms
      to deploy upstream filtering.  The goals of these techniques is to



Moura, et al.          Expires September 12, 2019               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft          Recomm-Authoritative-Ops              March 2019


      perform some combination of shifting of both legitimate and attack
      traffic to other anycast instances (with hopefully greater
      capacity) or to block the traffic entirely.

   o  Alternatively, it can be become a degraded absorber, continuing to
      operate, but with overloaded ingress routers, dropping some
      incoming legitimate requests due to queue overflow.  However,
      continued operation will also absorb traffic from attackers in its
      catchment, protecting the other anycast instances.

   [Moura16b] saw both of these behaviors in practice in the Root DNS
   events, observed through instance reachability and route-trip time
   (RTTs).  These options represent different uses of an anycast
   deployment.  The withdrawal strategy causes anycast to respond as a
   waterbed, with stress displacing queries from one instance to others.
   The absorption strategy behaves as a conventional mattress,
   compressing under load, with some queries getting delayed or dropped.

   Although described as strategies and policies, these outcomes are the
   result of several factors: the combination of operator and host ISP
   routing policies, routing implementations withdrawing under load, the
   nature of the attack, and the locations of the instances and the
   attackers.  Some policies are explicit, such as the choice of local-
   only anycast instances, or operators removing an instance for
   maintenance or modifying routing to manage load.  However, under
   stress, the choices of withdrawal and absorption can also be results
   that emerge from a mix of explicit choices and implementation
   details, such as BGP timeout values.

   [Moura16b] speculates that more careful, explicit, and automated
   management of policies may provide stronger defenses to overload, an
   area currently under study.  For DNS operators, that means that
   besides traditional filtering, two other options are available
   (withdraw/prepend/communities or isolate instances), and the best
   choice depends on the specifics of the attack.

   Note that this recommendation refers to the operation of one anycast
   service, i.e., one anycast NS record.  However, DNS zones with
   multiple NS anycast services may expect load to spill from one
   anycast server to another,as resolvers switch from authoritative to
   authoritative when attempting to resolve a name [Mueller17b].

6.  R5: Consider longer time-to-live values whenever possible

   In a DNS response, each resource record is accompanied by a time-to-
   live value (TTL), which "describes how long a RR can be cached before
   it should be discarded" [RFC1034].  The TTL values are set by zone
   owners in their zone files - either specifically per record or by



Moura, et al.          Expires September 12, 2019               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft          Recomm-Authoritative-Ops              March 2019


   using default values for the entire zone.  Sometimes the same
   resource record may have different TTL values - one from the parent
   and one from the child DNS server.  In this case, resolvers are
   expected to prioritize the answer according to Section 5.4.1 in
   [RFC2181].

   While set at authoritative servers, (ATn in Figure 1), the TTL value
   in fact influences the behavior of recursive resolvers (and their
   operators - "Re_n" in the same figure), by setting an upper limit on
   how long a record should be cached before discarded.  In this sense,
   caching can be seen as a sort of "ephemeral replication", i.e., the
   contents of an authoritative server are placed at a recursive
   resolver cache for a period of time up to the TTL value.  Caching
   improves response times by avoiding repeated queries between
   recursive resolvers and authoritative.

   Besides improving performance, it has been argued that caching plays
   a significant role in protecting users during DDoS attacks against
   authoritative servers.  To investigate that, [Moura18b] evaluates the
   role of caching (and retries) in DNS resiliency to DDoS attacks.  Two
   authoritative servers were configured for a newly registered domain
   and a series of experiments were carried out using various TTL values
   (60,1800, 3600, 86400s) for records.  Unique DNS queries were sent
   from roughly 15,000 vantage points, using RIPE Atlas.

   [Moura18b] found that, under normal operations, caching works as
   expected 70% of the times in the wild.  It is believed that complex
   recursive infrastructure (such as anycast recursives with fragmented
   cache), besides cache flushing and hierarchy explains these other 30%
   of the non-cached records.  The results from the experiments were
   confirmed by analyzing authoritative traffic for the .nl TLD, which
   showed similar figures.

   [Moura18b] also emulated DDoS attacks on authoritative servers by
   dropping all incoming packets for various TTLs values.  For
   experiments when all authoritative servers were completely
   unreachable, they found that the TTL value on the DNS records
   determined how long clients received responses, together with the
   status of the cache at the attack time.  Given the TTL value
   decreases as time passes at the cache, it protected clients for up to
   its value in cache.  Once the TTL expires, there was some evidence of
   some recursives serving stale content [I-D.ietf-dnsop-serve-stale].
   Serving stale is the only viable option when TTL values expire in
   recursive caches and authoritative servers became completely
   unavailable.

   They also emulated partial-failure DDoS, i.e., DDoS that cause
   authoritative to respond to be able to respond part of the queries

   (similar to Dyn 2016 [Perlroth16]).  They emulate such scenario by
   dropping incoming packet at rates of 50-90%, for various TTL values.
   They found that:

   o  Caching was a key component in the success of queries.  For
      example, with a 50% packet drop rate at the authoritatives, most
      clients eventually got an answer.

   o  Recursives retries was also a key part of resilience: when caching
      could not help (for a scenario with TTL of 60s, and time in
      between probing of 10 minutes), recursive servers kept retrying
      queries to authoritatives.  With 90% packet drop on both
      authoritatives (with TTL of 60s), 27% of clients still got an
      answer due to retries, at the price of increased response times.
      However, this came with a price for authroritative servers: a 8.1
      times increase in normal traffic during a 90% packet drop with TTL
      of 60s, as recursives attempt to resolve queries - thus
      effectively creating "friendly fire".

   Altogether, these results help to explain why previous attacks
   against the Roots were not noticed by most users [Moura18b] and why
   other attacks (such as Dyn 2016 [Perlroth16]) had significant impact
   on users experience: records on the Root zone have TTL values ranging
   from 1 to 6 days, while some of unreachable Dyn clients had TTL
   values ranging from 120 to 300s, which limit how long records ought
   to be cached.

   Therefore, given the important role of the TTL on user's experience
   during a DDoS attack (and in reducing ''friendly fire''), it is
   recommended that DNS zone owners set their TTL values carefully,
   using reasonable TTL values (at least 1 hour) whenever possible,
   given its role in DNS resilience against DDoS attacks.  However, the
   choice of the value depends on the specifics of each operator (CDNs
   are known for using TTL values in the range of few minutes).  The
   drawback of setting larger TTL values is that changes on the
   authoritative system infrastructure (e.g.: adding a new authoritative
   server or changing IP address) will take at least as long as the TTL
   to propagate among clients.

7.  R6: Shared Infrastructure Risks Collateral Damage During Attacks

   Co-locating services, such as authoritative servers, creates some
   degree of shared risk, in that stress on one service may spill over
   into another, resulting in collateral damage.  Collateral damage is a
   common side-effect of DDoS, and data centers and operators strive to
   minimize collateral damage through redundancy, overcapacity, and
   isolation.




Moura, et al.          Expires September 12, 2019              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft          Recomm-Authoritative-Ops              March 2019


   This has been seen in practice during the DDoS attack against the
   Root DNS system in November 2015 [Moura16b].  In this study, it was
   shown that two services not directly targeted by the attack, namely
   D-Root and the .nl TLD, suffered collateral damage.  These services
   showed reduced end-to-end performance (i.e., higher latency and
   reduced reachability) with timing consistent with the DDoS event,
   strongly suggesting a shared resource with original targets of the
   attack.

   Another example of collateral damage was the 1.2 Tbps attack against
   Dyn, a major DNS provider on October 2017 [Perlroth16].  As a result,
   many of their customers, including Airbnb, HBO, Netflix, and Twitter
   experienced issues with clients failing to resolve their domains,
   since the servers partially shared the same infrastructure.

   It is recommended, therefore, when choosing third-party DNS
   providers, operators should be aware of shared infrastructure risks.
   By sharing infrastructure, there is an increased attack surface.
