1.  Introduction

   This document describes the state machines for NAT/FW NSLP [1],
   trying to show how NAT/FW NSLP can be implemented to support its
   deployment.  The state machines described in this document are
   illustrative of how the NAT/FW NSLP protocol defined in [1] may be
   implemented for the first NAT/FW NSLP node in the signaling path,
   intermediate NAT/FW NSLP nodes with Firewall and/or NAT
   functionality, and the last NAT/FW NSLP node in the signaling path.
   Where there are differences [1] are authoritative.  The state
   machines are informative only.  Implementations may achieve the same
   results using different methods.

   The messages used in the NAT/FW NSLP protocol can be summarized as
   follows:

      Requesting message       Responding message
      ------------------------+---------------------------
      CREATE                  |RESPONSE
      REA                     |RESPONSE
      TRACE                   |RESPONSE
      RESPONSE                |NONE
      NOTIFY                  |NONE
      ------------------------+---------------------------

   We describe a set of state machines for different roles of entities
   running NAT/FW NSLP to illustrate how NAT/FW NSLP may be implemented.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [2].


3.  Notational conventions used in state diagrams

   The following state transition tables are completed mostly based on
   the conventions specified in [3].  The complete text is described
   below.

   State transition tables are used to represent the operation of the
   protocol by a number of cooperating state machines each comprising a
   group of connected, mutually exclusive states.  Only one state of
   each machine can be active at any given time.

   All permissible transitions from a given state to other states and

Internet-Draft            NAT/FW State Machine                March 2006


   associated actions performed when the transitions occur are
   represented by using triplets of (exit condition, exit action, exit
   state).  All conditions are expressions that evaluate to TRUE or
   FALSE; if a condition evaluates to TRUE, then the condition is met.
   A state "ANY" is a wildcard state that matches the current state in
   each state machine.  The exit conditions of a wildcard state are
   evaluated after all other exit conditions of specific to the current
   state are met.

   On exit from a state, the procedures defined for the state and the
   exit condition are executed exactly once, in the order that they
   appear on the page.  (Note that the procedures defined in [4] are
   executed on entry to a state, which is one major difference from this
   document.)  Each procedure is deemed to be atomic; i.e., execution of
   a procedure completes before the next sequential procedure starts to
   execute.  No procedures execute outside of a state block.  The
   procedures in only one state block execute at a time, even if the
   conditions for execution of state blocks in different state machines
   are satisfied, and all procedures in an executing state block
   complete execution before the transition to and execution of any
   other state block occurs, i.e., the execution of any state block
   appears to be atomic with respect to the execution of any other state
   block and the transition condition to that state from the previous
   state is TRUE when execution commences.  The order of execution of
   state blocks in different state machines is undefined except as
   constrained by their transition conditions.  A variable that is set
   to a particular value in a state block retains this value until a
   subsequent state block executes a procedure that modifies the value.

   On completion of the transition from the previous state to the
   current state, all exit conditions for the current state (including
   exit conditions defined for the wildcard state) are evaluated
   continuously until one of the conditions is met.

   Any event variable is set to TRUE when the corresponding event occurs
   and set to FALSE immediately after completion of the action
   associated with the current state and the event.

   The interpretation of the special symbols and operators is reused
   from [4] and the state diagrams are based on the conventions
   specified in [5], Section 8.2.1.

   The complete text is reproduced here:


      State diagrams are used to represent the operation of the protocol
      by a number of cooperating state machines each comprising a group
      of connected, mutually exclusive states.  Only one state of each

      machine can be active at any given time.

      All permissible transitions between states are represented by
      arrows, the arrowhead denoting the direction of the possible
      transition.  Labels attached to arrows denote the condition(s)
      that must be met in order for the transition to take place.  All
      conditions are expressions that evaluate to TRUE or FALSE; if a
      condition evaluates to TRUE, then the condition is met.  The label
      UCT denotes an unconditional transition (i.e., UCT always
      evaluates to TRUE).  A transition that is global in nature (i.e.,
      a transition that occurs from any of the possible states if the
      condition attached to the arrow is met) is denoted by an open
      arrow; i.e., no specific state is identified as the origin of the
      transition.  When the condition associated with a global
      transition is met, it supersedes all other exit conditions
      including UCT.  The special global condition BEGIN supersedes all
      other global conditions, and once asserted remains asserted until
      all state blocks have executed to the point that variable
      assignments and other consequences of their execution remain
      unchanged.

      On entry to a state, the procedures defined for the state (if any)
      are executed exactly once, in the order that they appear on the
      page.  Each action is deemed to be atomic; i.e., execution of a
      procedure completes before the next sequential procedure starts to
      execute.  No procedures execute outside of a state block.  The
      procedures in only one state block execute at a time, even if the
      conditions for execution of state blocks in different state
      machines are satisfied, and all procedures in an executing state
      block complete execution before the transition to and execution of
      any other state block occurs, i.e., the execution of any state
      block appears to be atomic with respect to the execution of any
      other state block and the transition condition to that state from
      the previous state is TRUE when execution commences.  The order of
      execution of state blocks in different state machines is undefined
      except as constrained by their transition conditions.  A variable
      that is set to a particular value in a state block retains this
      value until a subsequent state block executes a procedure that
      modifies the value.

      On completion of all of the procedures within a state, all exit
      conditions for the state (including all conditions associated with
      global transitions) are evaluated continuously until one of the
      conditions is met.  The label ELSE denotes a transition that
      occurs if none of the other conditions for transitions from the
      state are met (i.e., ELSE evaluates to TRUE if all other possible
      exit conditions from the state evaluate to FALSE).  Where two or
      more exit conditions with the same level of precedence become TRUE



Werner, et al.          Expires September 7, 2006               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft            NAT/FW State Machine                March 2006


      simultaneously, the choice as to which exit condition causes the
      state transition to take place is arbitrary.

   In addition to the above notation, there are a couple of
   clarifications specific to this document.  First, all boolean
   variables are initialized to FALSE before the state machine execution
   begins.  Second, the following notational shorthand is specific to
   this document:

   <variable> = <expression1> | <expression2> | ...
      Execution of a statement of this form will result in <variable>
      having a value of exactly one of the expressions.  The logic for
      which of those expressions gets executed is outside of the state
      machine and could be environmental, configurable, or based on
      another state machine such as that of the method.


4.  State Machine Symbols

   ( ) Used to force the precedence of operators in Boolean expressions
      and to delimit the argument(s) of actions within state boxes.
   ;  Used as a terminating delimiter for actions within state boxes.
      Where a state box contains multiple actions, the order of
      execution follows the normal language conventions for reading
      text.
   =  Assignment action.  The value of the expression to the right of
      the operator is assigned to the variable to the left of the
      operator.  Where this operator is used to define multiple
      assignments, e.g., a = b = X the action causes the value of the
      expression following the right-most assignment operator to be
      assigned to all of the variables that appear to the left of the
      right-most assignment operator.
   !  Logical NOT operator.
   && Logical AND operator.
   || Logical OR operator.
   if...then... Conditional action.  If the Boolean expression following
      the if evaluates to TRUE, then the action following the then is
      executed.
   { statement 1, ... statement N } Compound statement.  Braces are used
      to group statements that are executed together as if they were a
      single statement.
   != Inequality.  Evaluates to TRUE if the expression to the left of
      the operator is not equal in value to the expression to the right.
   == Equality.  Evaluates to TRUE if the expression to the left of the
      operator is equal in value to the expression to the right.

   >  Greater than.  Evaluates to TRUE if the value of the expression to
      the left of the operator is greater than the value of the
      expression to the right.
   <= Less than or equal to.  Evaluates to TRUE if the value of the
      expression to the left of the operator is either less than or
      equal to the value of the expression to the right.
   ++ Increment the preceding integer operator by 1.


5.  Common Rules

   Throughout the document we use terms defined in the [1], such as NI,
   NF, NR, CREATE, REA or RESPONSE.

5.1.  Common Procedures

   tx_CREATE(): Transmit a CREATE message
   tx_CREATE(LIFETIME=0): Transmit CREATE message with lifetime object
      explicitly set to 0 for session deletion
   tx_RESPONSE(code,type): Transmit RESPONSE message with specified code
      (SUCCESS or ERROR) and result type (related to a specific request
      type message: CREATE or REA).  A code or result type may be
      omitted, typically when forwarding received RESPONSE messages.
   tx_REA(): Transmit a REA message
   rx_RESPONSE(code, type): Evaluates to TRUE if a RESPONSE message has
      been received with the specified code (SUCCESS or ERROR) and
      result type (related to a specific request type message: CREATE or
      REA).  If the code or type is omitted, any received RESPONSE
      message which is only matching the given code or type will
      evaluate this procedure to TRUE.
   rx_CREATE(): Evaluates to TRUE if a CREATE message has been received.
   rx_REA(): Evaluates to TRUE if a REA message has been received.
   CHECK_AA(): Checks Authorization and Authentication of the received
      message.  Evaluates to TRUE if the check is successful, otherwise
      it evaluates to FALSE.  This check is performed on all received
      messages hence it will only be shown within the state machine when
      the check has failed.  This CHECK_AA also MAY include a local
      policy check for the received message.
   CreateSession(): Installs all session related states, variables,
      bindings, policies.
   DeleteSession(): Removes all session related states, variables,
      bindings, policies.
   CreatePinhole(): Installs a pinhole for the new session.
   DeletePinhole(): Removes a previously installed pinhole.

Internet-Draft            NAT/FW State Machine                March 2006


   CreateReservations(): Creates a matching based on the MRI and open
      pinholes for the signaling traffic.
   DeleteReservations(): Deletes previously installed matchings and
      pinholes for the signaling traffic.
   CreateBinding(): Creates a public/private network translation binding
      on a NAT device for the requesting entity.
   DeleteBinding(): Deletes a previously created a public/private
      network translation binding on a NAT device for the requesting
      entity.
   StartTimer(identifier): This procedure starts a timer with a certain
      timespan, which is up to the specific implementation.  The
      parameter 'identifier' identifies this timer uniquely.  Any
      subsequent StartTimer(identifier), StopTimer(identifier),
      (identifier)_TIMEOUT refer to the same timer labeled x.  This
      timer is required to time the lifetime of state, which means that
      when it times out, it indicates the current machine state should
      be left or its validation has expired.  This procedure starts the
      timer 'identifier'.  If a timer with the same 'identifier' has
      already been started and not yet stopped, the timer is now stopped
      and restarted.  After the timer has timed out, the procedure
      (identifier)_TIMEOUT evaluates to TRUE.  The timer does not
      restart automatically, but must be started again with a
      StartTimer(identifier).  Notice that this function can call as
      statetimer or as refreshtimer which represents the
      "Start.REFRESH_TIMER(identifier)" procedure in version 01.
   StopTimer(identifier): This procedure stops the timer labeled
      'identifier'.  If it has already been stopped, this procedure has
      no effect.  If the timer has already timed out, this procedure
      removes the timeout-state from the timer 'identifier', so
      subsequent calls to (identifier)_TIMEOUT evaluate to FALSE.  A
      timeout cannot occur until the timer 'identifier' has been
      (re-)started.
   (identifier)_TIMEOUT: This procedure evaluates to TRUE if the
      (identifier)-timer has timed out and indicates a state lifetime
      expiration.  This procedure cannot evaluate to TRUE if the timer
      has been stopped.  Used timers are STATE_TIMEOUT, REFRESH_TIMEOUT,
      CREATE_TIMEOUT, REA_TIMEOUT or RESPONSE_TIMEOUT.
   tg_CREATE: External trigger to send a CREATE message (typically
      triggered by the application).
   tg_TEARDOWN: External trigger to delete a previously created session
      (typically triggered by the application)
   tg_REA: External trigger to send a REA message towards an
      opportunistic address (typically triggered by the application)
   tg_CREATE_PROXY: Internal trigger to send a CREATE message (used in
      proxy mode, triggered by corresponding NAT/FW NSLP session).

   tg_TEARDOWN_PROXY: Internal trigger to delete a previously created
      session (used in proxy mode, triggered by corresponding NAT/FW
      NSLP session).

5.2.  Common Variables

   IS_EDGE: Boolean flag which evaluates to TRUE if the node is on the
      network edge, otherwise it evaluates to FALSE.
   IS_PUBLICSIDE: Boolean flag which evaluates to TRUE if the (CREATE-
      or REA-) message has been received on the public side of the
      network.
   CREATE(LIFETIME): Gets the value of the LIFETIME object in the CREATE
      message.
   counter(CREATE): Denotes the current number of retries of CREATE
      message which has been re-transmitted due to previous
      RESPONSE_ERROR message.  If the number of counter(CREATE) equals
      the value of counterLimit(CREATE), the current session creation
      attempt is aborted and the application is being notified.
   counter(REA): Denotes the current number of retries of REA message
      which has been re-transmitted due to previous RESPONSE_ERROR
      message.  If the number of counter(REA) equals the value of
      counterLimit(REA), the current session creation attempt is aborted
      and the application is being notified.

5.3.  Constants

   counterLimit(CREATE): Contains the maximum number of retransmission
      attempts of a CREATE message after it is aborted and the
      application is being notified.
   counterLimit(REA): Contains the maximum number of retransmission
      attempts of a REA message after it is aborted and the application
      is being notified.

9.  Security Considerations

   This document does not raise new security considerations.  Any
   security concerns with the NAT/FW NSLP are likely reflected in
   security related NSIS work already (such as [1] or [6]).

   For the time being, the state machines described in this document do
   not consider the security aspect of NAT/FW NSLP protocol itself.  A
   future version of this document will add security relevant states and
   state transitions.


10.  Open Issues

   Since 01 version, we removed session ownership, change procedure-
   names and added some clarifications according to the specification
   evolution.  Route change and the open issues in [1] will be added in
   future versions of this document.


11.  Contributors

   Tseno Tsenov contributed since the initial version and Henning Peters
   collaborated to refining of the state machine since 01 version.
