                  RSVP Extensions for Dynamic Reservation
                 draft-chodorek-tsvwg-rsvp-dynamic-resv-00


Abstract

   RSVP reservations are static in nature and typically last for the
   whole session. The proposed extension to the RSVP allows the RSVP to
   make elastic adjustments to reservations for the current demand of
   network resources. The proposed method dynamically changes the RSVP
   reservations on the basis of knowledge about transmitted traffic.

1. Introduction

   The proposed extension to the Resource ReserVation Protocol (RSVP)
   [RFC2205] enables reservations to be changed dynamically in the event
   of changes to network resource requirements for the transmitted
   multimedia stream. The proposed extension, in many cases, allows for
   the release of some of the network resources, allowing for their
   utilization by other transmissions. In practice, released resources
   can be used for the transmission of elastic traffic (e.g. the traffic
   observed during transmissions carried out using the TCP or other
   reliable transport protocols).

   Information about the behavior of the stream that will be transmitted
   in the near future is often available in the transmitter. It can be
   derived, for instance, from measurements taken in the output buffer
   or as a result of traffic predictions [Cho2002]. This information can
   be used in intermediate nodes for dynamic bandwidth allocation (as,
   for example, the extension to the RSVP based on dynamic resource

   reservations [Cho2010] or the prediction-based bandwidth
   renegotiation module [Cho2003]).

   The proposed extension to the RSVP is designed to transmit dynamic
   information about traffic change and traffic requirements to
   intermediate nodes and end node(s).

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

2. RSVP Dynamic Reservation Protocol Mechanisms

   The RSVP session for the multimedia transmission is setup using
   standard Path and Resv messages exchange [RFC2205]. The Path message
   creates the nodes data structure that stores the state of the
   session. The Resv message performs reservations using admission
   control procedures. If the session is successfully established the
   session is regularly updated by Path and Resv messages [RFC2205].

   The RSVP Extension for Dynamic Reservations uses two new message
   types: PathChange and ResvChange. The proposed messages don't alter
   standard Path and Resv messages functionality. During the RSVP
   session the sender of multimedia can send information about new
   requirements for network resources. This is accomplished by using
   PathChange messages. After the reception of the PathChange message
   the receiver will change the allocation of network resources by
   sending the ResvChange message. The proposed messages don't influence
   admission control procedures. They only change current resource
   allocation.

   It is also possible to change resource allocation using only
   PathChange messages. In this case resource allocations will be
   changed after receiving the PathChange message. To enable this
   capability in the Common Header a new flag D (sec. 3.1) must be set
   up.

   The PathChange or ResvChange messages carry a TIME_VALUES object
   containing the refresh time R. The time R determines the lifetime of
   the dynamic change of resource allocation. If this time has expired
   the proposed RSVP Extension for Dynamic Reservations returns to the
   settings defined by the Resv messages.

3. RSVP Dynamic Reservation Message Formats

   The RSVP Extension for Dynamic Reservation uses two new messages
   types, PathChange and ResvChange. It also proposes a new definition
   for the usage of the Flag field in the Common Header.

3.1. The new Flag definition in the Common Header

   The PathChange Messages can change resource allocations without using
   ResvChange Messages. To negotiate and enable this capability a new
   format of the Flag in the Common Header [RFC2205] has been defined:

      +-+-+-+-+
      | Res |D|
      +-+-+-+-+

     Res (3 bit):

       The Res (Reserved) field MUST be set to zero

     D (1 bit):

       Indicates the capability of the RSVP implementation to change
   resource allocation in the nodes after receiving a PathChange
   message:
       0 not capable of the new features
       1 capable of the new features

3.2. The PathChange Messages

   The PathChange Messages are sent from sender to receiver(s) like the
   Path messages. The formats of the PatchChange can be represented
   based on the Backus-Naur Form (BNF) [RFC5511] as follows:

            <PathChange Message> ::= <Common Header> [ <INTEGRITY> ]
                               <SESSION> <RSVP_HOP>
                               <TIME_VALUES>
                               <sender change descriptor>

   <sender change descriptor> ::= <SENDER_TEMPLATE> <SENDER_TCHSPEC>
                               [ <SENDER_TSPEC> ] [ <ADSPEC> ]

3.3. The ResvChange Messages

   The ResvChange Messages are sent from sender to receiver(s) like the
   Resv messages. The formats of the ResvChange can be represented based
   on the BNF [RFC5511] as follows:

            <ResvChange Message> ::= <Common Header> [ <INTEGRITY> ]
                                   <SESSION>  <RSVP_HOP>
                                   <TIME_VALUES>
                                   [ <RESV_CONFIRM> ]  [ <SCOPE> ]

                                   <flow change descriptor list>
                                   <flow change descriptor>

   WF Style:

          <flow change descriptor list> ::=  <WF flow change descriptor>

         <WF flow change descriptor> ::= <FLOWCHANGESPEC> [ <FLOWSPEC> ]

   FF style:

          <flow change descriptor list> ::=
                             <FLOWCHANGESPEC>  <FILTER_SPEC>  |
                  <flow change descriptor list> <FF flow descriptor>

                   <FF flow change descriptor> ::=
                      [ <FLOWCHANGESPEC> ] [ <FLOWSPEC> ] <FILTER_SPEC>

   SE style:

           <flow change descriptor list> ::= <SE flow change descriptor>

             <SE flow change descriptor> ::=
                      <FLOWCHANGESPEC> [ <FLOWSPEC> ] <filter spec list>

4. RSVP Dynamic Reservation Objects

   The RSVP Extension for Dynamic Reservation uses two new objects,
   namely a SENDER_TCHSPEC and a FLOWCHANGESPEC.

4.1. SENDER_TCHSPEC Object

   The SENDER_TCHSPEC object is used to convey information about future
   values of traffic flow. The SENDER_TCHSPEC object has the following
   format:

   SENDER_TCHSPEC class = To be allocated by IANA

   Type 1 SENDER_TCHSPEC object: Class = TBD, C-Type = 1

   Next Data (32 bit):

     size (in bytes) of data sent in the near future.

       If Flag F is not set (F == 0):

         Next Data = Next Data

         If Flag F is set (F == 1), Next Data represents a floating-
   point value as follows (representation is used in accordance with
   IEEE 754 single precision):

   Next Time (32 bit):

     Time (in milliseconds) the counting of data that were included in
   the field Next Data.

   Token Bucket Rate [r] (32 bit):

     First parameter to the token bucket specification average of token
   rate [r] - 32-bit IEEE single precision floating point number

   Token Bucket Size [b] (32 bit):

     Second parameter to the token bucket specification bucket depth
   [b] - 32-bit IEEE single precision floating point number

5. Security Considerations

   Security considerations to be provided.

6. IANA Considerations

   A message type must be assigned by IANA for the PathChange and
   ResvChange messages.

   A Class Number (C-Num) must be assigned by IANA for the Type 1
   SENDER_TCHSPEC object and Type 1 FLOWCHANGESPEC object.
