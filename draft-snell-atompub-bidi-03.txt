Internet-Draft                  Atom Bidi                     March 2007


1.  Introduction

   This document updates the Atom Syndication Format [RFC4287] by adding
   a new 'dir' attribute used to define the base directionality of
   directionally-neutral characters contained within an Atom document.

1.1.  Namespace

   The XML Namespaces URI [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114] for the Atom
   Syndication Format [RFC4287] is:
   http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom

1.2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].

   The Atom Syndication Format [RFC4287] is specified using terms from
   the XML Infoset [W3C.REC-xml-infoset-20040204].  This specification
   uses a shorthand form for two commons terms: The phrase "Information
   Item" is omitted when naming Element and Attribute Information Items.
   Therefore, when this specification uses the term "element," it is
   referring to an Element Information Item in Infoset terms.  Likewise,
   when it uses the term "attribute," it is referring to an Attribute
   Information Item.

   Portions this specification are illustrated with fragments of a non-
   normative RELAX NG Compact schema [RELAXNG].  However, the text of
   this specification provides the sole definition of conformance.


2.  The "dir" Attribute

   The "dir" attribute specifies the base direction of directionally-
   neutral text [UNICODE].  Possible values for the attribute are "ltr"
   and "rtl" indicating "left-to-right" and "right-to-left"
   respectively, or an empty string indicating that no base-direction is
   specified.  If the "dir" attribute is not specified, the value is
   assumed to be an empty string.  The attribute can appear on any
   element in an Atom document.

     atomCommonAttributes =
       attribute xml:base { atomUri }?,
       attribute xml:lang { atomLanguageTag }?,
       attribute dir { "ltr" | "rtl" | "" }?,
       undefinedAttribute*

   The direction specified by "dir" applies to elements and attributes
   whose values are specified as being "Language-Sensitive" as defined
   by Section 2 of [RFC4287].  The direction specified by the attribute
   is inherited by descendent elements and attributes and may be
   overridden.

   Example atom:feed with right-to-left directionality

     <?xml version="1.0" ?>
     <feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" dir="rtl">
       <title>&#x0679;&#x067A;&#x067B;</title>
       ...
     </feed>

   If an Atom document contains any right-to-left characters, the
   Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm [UNI9] SHOULD be used to render that
   text.  Because consumers of Atom documents vary broadly in the way
   they display text, the "ltr" and "rtl" values do not necessarily open
   an additional level of embedding with respect to the bidirectional
   algorithm.  Consuming applications that render bidirectional text are
   responsible for determining the appropriate level of embedding.  If
   the dir attribute value is "rtl", Atom processors that display
   affected text MAY choose to right-align that text as per the rules
   described in Section 8 of [W3C.REC-html401-19991224].

   When Atom Text Constructs or the atom:content elements contain
   bidirectional text and the type attribute value is either "html" or
   "xhtml", the bidirectional markup mechanisms specific to each format
   SHOULD be used.  The value of the "dir" attribute does define the
   base directionality of Language-Sensitive text within Text Constructs
   and atom:content elements regardless of the value of the type
   attribute.

   Example atom:feed with bidirectional XHTML:

     <?xml version="1.0" ?>
     <feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" dir="rtl">
       <title type="xhtml">
         <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
           <p dir="rtl">&#x0679;&#x067A;&#x067B;</p>
         </div>
       </title>
       ...
     </feed>

   Unicode bidirectional control characters MAY also be used within
   attributes and element values to indicate the directionality of text
   or to modify the default operation of the Bidirectional Algorithm.

   Implementers are reminded that unexpected results could occur when
   using both the "dir" attribute and the Unicode control characters
   within a single document.

2.1.  Direction Guessing

   In Atom documents that do not contain a "dir" attribute, it is
   possible to apply heuristics to guess the base directionality of text
   in the document.  Such heuristics can take into consideration the in-
   scope language context established by the use of the xml:lang
   attribute or an analysis of the directional properties of the Unicode
   characters used within the documents text.  Such guessing algorithms
   can produce reasonably acceptable results in many cases but cannot be
   guaranteed to produce correct results in every case.  For this
   reason, explicit determination of text direction using the "dir"
   attribute SHOULD be preferred over any guessing algorithm.


3.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations discussed in [RFC4287] Section 8 apply.


4.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA actions are required by this document.
