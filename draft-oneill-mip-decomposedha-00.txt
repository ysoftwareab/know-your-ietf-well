 Abstract 
  
   RFC 3344 [1] describes the current version of Mobile IP version 4    
   signaling and forwarding. The signaling and forwarding is conducted 
   between a Mobile Node and a Home Agent, via an optional intermediate 
   Foreign Agent, for a Home Address of the Mobile Node. The Home Agent 
   acts as the Mobile IP signaling endpoint, as well as the forwarding 
   endpoint for packet tunneling between the Home Agent and the MN Care 
   of Address. This document describes an alternative architecture in 
   which the Home Agent is the signaling endpoint whilst a new Tunnel 
   Agent acts as the forwarding endpoint.

 1. Problem Statement 
     
   RFC 3344 describes the current version of Mobile IP version 4 
   signaling and forwarding. The signaling and forwarding is conducted 
   between a Mobile Node and a Home Agent, via an optional intermediate 
   Foreign Agent, for a Home Address of the Mobile Node. The Home Agent 
   acts as the Mobile IP signaling endpoint, as well as the forwarding 
   endpoint for packet tunneling between the Home Agent and the MN Care 
   of Address. The general Internet Routing System considers that this 
   Home Address (and hence the associated MN interface) is located at 
   the Home Agent, whilst Mobile IP signaling and forwarding enables 
   that home address to instead be located at a remote Access Router, 
   which may optionally contain a Foreign Agent.

                   Decomposed Home Agent Architecture        July, 2004

   This dual-mode Home Agent exhibits a number of characteristics;

   i) The Home Agent node implementation has to be optimized for both MIP
      signaling and forwarding operations.
  ii) The Home Agent location needs to be optimized both from a MIP 
      signaling and forwarding perspective. 
 iii) Failure of the Home Agent typically renders both MIP signaling and
      forwarding inoperable for each of the mobility bindings at that 
      Home Agent.
  iv) The Home Agent optionally needs to support additional interfaces to
      AAA, Security, Address Management and other policy servers to 
      provide a complete set of mobility features whilst scaling to 
      support a very large number of MNs.

   The design and operational conflicts and compromises that arise when 
   a single node attempts to undertake multiple large-scale, high 
   availability tasks have been seen before in telecommunication and 
   Internet systems (CAS v CCS, MGCP v SIP etc) and the IETF presently 
   has a working group looking at a general protocol framework (FORCES) 
   for decomposing network nodes into distinct control and forwarding 
   elements that are synchronized by a control protocol. In addition, 2G 
   and 3G cellular systems separate forwarding (MSC/GGSN) from control 
   (HLR/VLR) as much as possible although the analogy is somewhat 
   stretched here especially in the Packet Domain.

   This document therefore describes an alternative MIP architecture in 
   which the Home Agent is decomposed and remains the MIP signaling 
   endpoint, whilst a new Tunnel Agent acts as the MIP forwarding 
   endpoint. This enables the Decomposed Home Agent to be optimized and 
   located for MIP signaling purposes whilst the new Tunnel Agent can be 
   independently optimized and located for forwarding purposes. The 
   document first describes the minimal MIP extensions required to 
   facilitate this decomposition, and then investigates a couple of 
   implementation scenarios and the potential associated operational 
   advantages of the architecture. The decomposition is equally 
   applicable to MIPv6 but that is outside the scope of this document.

 3. Requirements and Scope 
  
   Following are the requirements that the proposed decomposed Home 
   Agent architecture tries to satisfy. 
     
   -  Physical separation of the MIP signaling and forwarding 
      endpoints in the core network.

   -  The carriage of a claimed Tunnel Agent address in MIP signaling to 
      the DHA.

   -  The carriage of an assigned Tunnel Agent address in MIP signaling 
      to the TEN.

   -  Support for multiple DHAs and TAs per MN for high availability 
      deployments.

   -  Support for common channel and channel associated Tunnel Agent 
      Control protocols (TACP) between the DHA and the TA for managing  
      tunnel bindings.

   The following architecture components and analysis are not undertaken 
   in this document.

   -  Definition of the detailed requirements or mechanisms for either 
      version of TACP.

   -  Definition of the requirements or mechanisms for, the dynamic 
      assignment of a Tunnel Agent address and HoA address at the DHA. 

   -  Detailed theoretical, financial or operational comparisons between 
      the existing products and deployments based on RFC3344 
      architecture and the Decomposed Home Agent architecture.
     

 4. The Decomposed Home Agent (DHA) Architecture

   The DHA has optional interfaces into external policy elements such as 
   address management, security and AAA servers much as the RFC3344 HA. 
   The Decomposed Home Agent acts as a æMIP ControllerÆ for one or more 
   Tunnel Agents under its control, on behalf of MNs. The DHA receives 

 A.W.OÆNeill           Expires - January 12, 2005              [Page 4]
                   Decomposed Home Agent Architecture        July, 2004

   RRQ signals from the MN and returns RRP signals to that MN via any 
   intermediate FAs. The DHA is aware of the mapping between Tunnel 
   Agents and HoA prefixes, and may also be aware of preferred Tunnel 
   Agents per MN, and/or for a specific aggregate of ARs. The DHA is 
   able to provide a dynamic Tunnel Agent grant as well as dynamic Home 
   Address assignment, but can alternatively verify a requested Tunnel 
   Agent and/or HoA for a MN. The DHA also has means, compliant with 
   RFC3344, to authenticate MIP signaling with the MN and with an 
   optional FA on the signaling path. 

   The Tunnel Agent is a new MIP element that supports MIP tunneling 
   operations to/from the Tunnel Endpoint Node (TEN = MN or FA) at which 
   the MN CoA is located (MN CCoA or FA CoA). Each TA undertakes 
   tunneling operations for one or more MNs, and for one or more HoAs 
   per MN. The general Internet Routing System considers that each MN 
   HoA (and hence the associated MN interface) is located at the Tunnel 
   Agent (and not the DHA, unlike the RFC3344 HA). MIP forwarding 
   then enables that HoA to instead be dynamically located at a remote 
   Access Router (AR), which may optionally contain a Foreign Agent. 
   This specifically means that data packets between the CN and the MN 
   do not visit the DHA as shown in figure 1.

   RevTun     CNA<-----------------------TAA<=====FACoA----------HoA

                    Figure 1. TA based MIP Data forwarding

   The requested and/or granted Tunnel Agent address is carried in RRQ 
   and RRP MIP messages, between the MN and the DHA, using new MIP 
   extensions that are defined in section 5. The Tunnel Agent maintains 
   tunnel bindings much like the forwarding part of the RFC3344 HA, and 
   can support forward and reverse tunneling for IPinIP, GRE and IPSEC 
   tunnels much like a traditional RFC3344 HA. Note that general purpose 
   routers generally have support for low density tunneling operations 
   such that TAs can potentially be located throughout a routed domain 
   in a highly distributed and locally optimized way (from a forwarding 
   perspective). Two alternative signaling models, for managing the 
   tunnel agent bindings from the DHA, are overviewed in this document, 
   within sections 4.1 and 4.2. Both models support multiple redundant 
   TAs per MN HoA, or even alternative HoAs at redundant TAs. It is the 
   support for a Tunnel Agent Control Protocol that primarily enables 
   general purposes routers to become potential Tunnel Agents. The 
   Decomposed HA Architecture also fully supports specialized highly 
   centralized Tunnel Agent hardware/software (as does the forwarding 
   part of an RFC3344 HA) and is ambivalent on the optimal configuration 
   which is likely to be more closely tied to specific deployment 
   scenarios. Mixed deployments of centralized and distributed TAs under 
   a single DHA are intended to be supported.

   4.1 Common Channel Tunnel Agent Control Protocol (TACP-CC)

   The Decomposition of the HA follows the FORCES framework in which a 
   distinct control protocol is used between the DHA and the TA to 
   manage tunnel bindings. The FORCES protocol is a candidate TACP-CC 
   but the requirements for, and design of, the TACP-CC is outside the 
   scope of this document. This architecture is shown in figure 2 for 
   the case of the TEN being the FA. An optional Tunnel Agent Address 
   Request (TAAR) extension is added by the MN or the TEN into the RRQ, 
   and verified by the DHA. The MN adds the TAAR to inform the DHA of an 
   existing or preferred TA address, along with any associated allocated 
   HoA at that TA. The FA adds the TAAR on behalf of the MN for the 
   reasons above or to inform the DHA of a preferred TA in local AR 
   state that was optionally returned from the AAA infrastructure. The 
   TAAR can include an ALL-ZEROs TAA which indicates support for Tunnel 
   Agents without indicating a preferred TA.

   The Tunnel Agent Address Grant (TAAG) extension is added by the DHA 
   into the RRP and consumed by the TEN. It is optionally sent to the MN 
   if the MN originated the TAAR in the RRQ. The DHA uses the TACP-CC 
   protocol with the granted TA to install the required tunnel binding 
   into the TA, for the tunnel between the TA and the FA CoA. This state 
   is commensurate with the parameters in the associated MIP signals. The 
   TACP-CC might employ peer to peer or client-server signaling models 
   and the tunnel bindings designed as soft or hard state. Figure 2 
   implies that the RRP is not sent by the DHA until the TACP-CC REP is 
   received back from the TA. However, the precise requirements in that 
   regard, given the soft-state best effort nature of MIP signaling, are 
   outside the scope of this overview document.

                  Figure 2. TACP-CC and MIP signaling model


   4.2 Channel Associated Tunnel Agent Control Protocol (TACP-CA)

   The Decomposition of the HA is such that the TA is located between 
   the AR and the DHA and is on the MIP signaling path. The TA tunnel 
   bindings are then installed using MIP RRQ/RRP extension signals that  
   traverse the TA as shown in figure 3. TACP-CA is therefore fully 
   integrated within MIP signaling. This model avoids the need for the 
   development of a new protocol between the DHA/TA but instead places 
   MIP signaling load on the TA. The required MIP extensions to support 
   an intermediate MIP agent will be similar to those developed for 

 A.W.OÆNeill           Expires - January 12, 2005              [Page 6]
                   Decomposed Home Agent Architecture        July, 2004

   regionalized MIP signaling schemes but the detailed requirements for, 
   and design of, these extensions are outside the scope of this 
   document. Figure 3 shows that the FA needs to know the TA address for 
   the routing of the RRQ, and hence must either obtain the TA address 
   from a RRQ(TAAG) received from the MN, or from local state at the FA 
   potentially returned from a AAA access_request. The FA can in the 
   latter cases verify a RRQ(TAAR) received from the MN.

                CN        DHA           TA           FA            MN

   RRQ(TACP-CA)             <#*#*#*#*#*#*<#*#*#*#*#*#<*#*#*#*#*#*#*#          	                                                                     
   RRP(TACP-CA)             *#*#*#*#*#*#*>#*#*#*#*#*#>*#*#*#*#*#*#*>

                     Figure 3. MIP based TACP-CA protocol


   Figure 3 implies that the MN-FA signaling is aware of the DHA / TA 
   architecture but again it should be made clear, that in the case of a 
   FACoA, the presence of the DHA/TA combination can be completely 
   hidden from the MN by the FA, and RFC3344 signaling employed between 
   the FA and the MN. 

   A further variant of the TACP-CA model is that the RRQ does not visit 
   the TA whilst the RRP, following TA address grant at the DHA, does 
   visit the granted TA. This avoids the need for the FA to determine 
   the TA address but is a significant departure from the traditional 
   MIP signaling model and therefore not further discussed here.


   4.3 Overview Comparison between TACP-CC and TACP-CA Models

   The TA-CA avoids having to support the MN-HA Security Associations 
   (SA) as well as the interfaces to the policy servers in the  
   operations zone which are instead reached through the DHA. The TA-CA 
   does however need an FA-TA SA which potentially could be shared 
   across a number FAs. The TA-CA can be distributed across the 
   routing domain and located optimally for forwarding purposes. The TA-
   CA does however still operate on per HoA MIP signaling and hence 
   still has high density high availability design constraints for both 
   the forwarding and signaling planes. The FA-CA needs to support some 
   additional minor MIP extensions as well as an FA-TA SA which 
   potentially could be shared with a number of TAs in the domain. The 
   FA-CA also needs to be able to determine the TAA so that the RRQ can 
   be routed via the selected TA to the DHA.

   The TA-CC avoids having to support the MN-HA SAs as well as the 
   interfaces to the policy servers in the operations zone which are 
   again reached through the DHA. The TA-CC does not need an FA-TA SA 
   and can also be distributed across the routing domain and located 
   optimally for forwarding purposes. The TA-CC does not operate on per 
   HoA MIP signaling but instead has a TACP-CC signaling session per DHA.

                   Decomposed Home Agent Architecture        July, 2004

   The FA-CC needs to support some additional minor MIP extensions but 
   does not need either an FA-TA SA or a means to determine the 
   preferred TA which is instead undertaken by the DHA.
   TA-CC and TA-CA have very different implications on signaling 
   resilience, performance and cost, and subsequently on the ideal 
   levels of distribution of the TA function for a given population of 
   MNs and ARs. These are not addressed in this overview document.
 
   In the case of FA CoAs, the MN may be fully isolated from whether the 
   core network is employing TACP-CC or TAP-CA decomposition signaling 
   which therefore enables MN to move and employ either system during one 
   or more MIP access sessions.


   4.4 Potential Benefits of the DHA

   It is clear from figures 2 and 3 that the DHA is in either case 
   absolved from packet forwarding yet retains its role as the MIP 
   signaling controller and primary interface into policy systems such 
   as the AAA and security infrastructure. The DHA continues to need a 
   MN-HA SA and a FA-HA SA as well as security associations with the 
   external policy systems. The DHA can now be co-located with those 
   policy servers behind an operational firewall as its location is now 
   not affected by forwarding constraints. The DHA can be implemented on 
   a high-availability server platform, using off-the-shelf hardware and 
   OS software, and its mobility and address management information 
   stored in a high availability database where it can be made available 
   to external application servers in support of general operations 
   (fault, fraud, performance etc), location based services, presence 
   servers and paging servers. The DHA function can specifically be 
   fully integrated within the AAA database infrastructure. 


   4.5 DHA Redundancy Enhancements

   A single logical DHA, fronting a high-availability server and storage 
   cluster, can clearly be used to support a very large number of 
   mobility bindings at reasonably  low cost. A pair of geographically 
   dispersed logical DHAs can be used by Mobile Internet Service 
   Providers (MISPs), much as AAA is architected for todayÆs ISPs. The 
   MNs associated with that domain can be persistently configured with 
   the primary and secondary DHA addresses, because irrespective of the 
   MN location, mobility signaling is always sent to one of those DHAs. 
   However, DHA failures will still of course occur and the DHA (and the 
   RFC3344 HA) can be assumed to be able to recover after some reboot 
   interval and retain some portion of ongoing binding information 
   depending on the type and resolution of the binding state storage. 
   The impact of a single or primary DHA failure, when compared to an 
   single or redundant pair of RFC3344 HAs, is however somewhat different.

      i) The DHA failure only affects binding changes because the 
         forwarding path is completely independent of the DHA, and 

 A.W.OÆNeill           Expires - January 12, 2005              [Page 8]
                   Decomposed Home Agent Architecture        July, 2004

         the tunnel state at the TA remains in place for the duration 
         of the DHA failure. 

     ii) During the failure, the MN can continue to receive packets at 
         its historical CoA stored in the TA, and can also move to a new 
         AR if the historical AR is providing forwarding for the 
         historical CoA towards the new CoA as a result of inter-AR MIP 
         signaling.

    iii) If a MN does not get a RRP back from a DHA then existing MNs 
         will retry and hence will be able to rebuild the mobility state 
         following the reboot interval, but will not be able to alter 
         its historical CoA during that interval. 

     iv) If the DHA misses a binding deregistration during its reboot, 
         and the MN disconnects from the historical CoA, then stale 
         state can exist on the DHA and/or TA until the lifetime of the 
         state at the TA expires. This however is no worse than the 
         scenario of a MN disconnecting at its historical CoA without 
         attempting to explicitly deregister that CoA at the DHA.

      v) If the primary DHA is deemed unavailable following some number 
         of missed RRPs, or following some timer, the MN can instead 
         contact the secondary DHA and include in that RRQ its existing 
         TA and HoA allocation state, as well as the modifications to 
         its MIP binding state. The secondary DHA can then independently 
         control the MNs HoA tunnel state at that TA and hence 
         continuity of the MNs communications is possible even with a 
         sustained DHA failure.

     vi) If the current TA of a MN HoA fails then access to the DHA is 
         maintained and so the MN can as a worst case request a new 
         dynamic TA-HoA assignment and resume its communications using 
         the new TA/HoA assignments.


   Therefore, it is possible that additional significant and cost 
   effective resilience is provided by the decomposition of the HA into 
   a DHA and a TA, and by the ability to employ two concurrent DHAs

   4.6 TA Redundancy Enhancements

   The DHA architecture offers support for TA redundancy, which enables 
   the IP routing system to reroute around TA failures. The MN may be 
   granted multiple TAs for a specific MIP signaling session that are 
   communicated to the MN TEN in multiple TAAGs. Each TA is located in a 
   single routing domain and each TA injects a prefix which covers the 
   HoA of the MN, in an anycast configuration. The metrics associated 
   with that HoA prefix, at any particular router in the routing domain, 
   produces a preferred TA for packets arriving from a specific CN at

   that router, that are destined for that MN HoA. Suitable selection of 
   prefix metrics in the routing domain can result in the TAs load-
   sharing traffic, with each TA dealing with a sub-set of the CNs that 
   are injecting packets towards that prefix. Alternatively, a primary 
   TA is used for all active CNs until that primary TA fails, In either 
   case, a TA failure results in the metric associated with the prefix 
   from that TA degrading to the extent that the other TA becomes the 
   sole forwarder for downstream packets towards that HoA prefix. The 
   speed of routing convergence for the route to the secondary TA is a 
   function of the type of routing protocols involved, the size of 
   the routing domain, and the topological distance between the primary 
   and secondary TAs. In a noteworthy configuration, somewhat 
   reminiscent of synchronized RFC3344 HAs in a hot-standby pair, the 
   primary and secondary TAs can be on the same subnet and ARP 
   mechanisms (gratuitous, proxy etc) used to move HoA specific traffic 
   between them. It should be pointed out however that the two TAs do 
   not need to support a tunnel binding synchronization protocol between 
   each other because each is independently slaved of the DHA.

   Upstream reverse tunneled traffic to the TAs may be delivered to 
   either of the redundant TAs although clearly it is beneficial if the 
   upstream traffic is sent to the TA that is the source of the 
   downstream traffic for each CN. When routing causes traffic from a 
   specific CN to be diverted to the alternative TA then this can act as
   a trigger for the upstream traffic to be reverse tunneled to that 
   alternative TA.

   The support for multiple TAs in TACP-CC is at a fairly obvious as it 
   simply requires the DHA to manage tunnel binding messages with 
   multiple TAs in parallel. However, TACP-CA requires further 
   description because a single MIP RRQ arriving at the FA needs to be   
   copied and routed to the DHA via both the primary and secondary TAs. 
   The MN and DHA (just as the RFC3344 HA) manage the Identification 
   parameter (for replay protection), so that the parameter space is 
   unaffected by the split. The FA therefore uses the Identification 
   information in the received RRQ, along with local state on the chosen
   primary and secondary TA addresses, to create RRQs towards each TA 
   containing the same Identification information so that the DHA can 
   match the redundant RRQs and issue associated redundant RRPs back via 
   the primary and secondary TAs to the common FA. The challenge-
   response protocol (RFC3012) information is similarly unaffected by 
   the redundancy procedure and is again duplicated in the redundant RRQ 
   and RRPs. However, it should be made clear that under various failure 
   conditions, further analysis may indicate a need for additional MIP 
   protocol mechanisms to ensure that message sequencing, matching and 
   replay protection is maintained.

   4.7 Additional Deployment Considerations

   The ability to locate the DHA and the TA in different parts of the 
   network leads to a number of capabilities covering specific 
   deployment scenarios.

   The use of MIP for corporate remote access [2] leads to the need for 
   firewall traversal of the MIP signaling and tunneling. Placing the HA 
   in the DMZ causes internal traffic to be routed via the DMZ whilst 
   placing the HA inside the corporate network causes external MIP 
   signaling to be allowed into the corporate network. The ability to 
   place the DHA in the DMZ, whilst placing the TAs either inside or 
   outside of the corporate network based on MN location should be of 
   particular benefit to that scenario.

   Inter-operator MIP roaming typically results in both inter-domain 
   signaling and forward, or results in the assignment of a HA in the 
   visited domain and hence a loss of visibility of mobility signaling 
   in the home domain. The decomposed architecture enables the home 
   domain DHA to continue to marshal the MIP signaling plane whilst 
   using an inter-domain protocol to manage tunnel bindings at a TA in 
   the visited domain and so avoid the need for inter-domain forwarding. 
   Alternatively, a visited domain DHA could be assigned to produce a 
   short MIP signaling path, yet ensure that the MN gets a home domain 
   TA and HoA as part of a wholesale/retail solution.

   The DHA maintains a view of all binding activity from the signaling 
   plane, and can receive packet forwarding metrics within TACP-CC (or 
   possibly even TACP-CA) from the TA, and therefore is in an excellent 
   position to manage load-sharing across a group of TAs. The DHA model 
   avoids the need for HA Redirection and hence the MN can continue to 
   use a well-known DHA across and within MIP access sessions whilst 
   still preserving the load-sharing capabilities for the operator. 

   An RFC3344 HA could additionally be extended to support 
   decomposition for a set of TAs for load-sharing / off-loading 
   purposes. The HA would act as the forwarder for some main set of HoA 
   prefixes, and when consumed, the HA could off-load the forwarding for 
   additional MNs to external TAs (with their own HoAs). This dual-mode 
   HA/DHA also of course provides support for RFC3344-only MNs and FAs, 
   and is therefore a nice option for incremental deployment.


 5. MIP extensions for the Decomposed HA Architecture  

   5.1 Tunnel Agent Address Request Extension (TAAR)

   This extension may be included in the RRQ by a MN to request a  
   specific Tunnel Agent address. If not inserted by the MN, then the 
   optional FA may alternatively request a specific Tunnel Agent address 
   to be assigned. This skippable extension follows the short extension 
   format as defined in [2], where the subtype indicates the specific

   5.2 Tunnel Agent Address Grant Extension (TAAG)

   The TAAG extension is included by the DHA in a RRP to inform the TEN 
   of the address of the assigned Tunnel Agent. The RRP(TAAG) may be 
   forwarded by the FA (TEN) to the MN when the MN has requested a 
   specific Tunnel Agent using the TAAR extension. The TAAG is also 
   included by a FA-CA in a RRQ(TAAG) to the assigned TA-CA, as the TA 
   assignment in the TACP-CA model is at the FA. This skippable 
   extension follows the short extension format as defined in [2], where 
   the subtype indicates the specific address management extension.

   5.3 TAAR Protocol Rules

   The MN sends the RRQ(TAAR) to either the HA or the FA to indicate 
   compliance with this document. The TAA may be 0.0.0.0 to request a 
   dynamic TAA assignment in which case a dynamic HoA MUST also be 
   requested. The TAA may be a.b.c.d to indicate a request to use a 
   specific TAA and the associated HoA field MAY be either 0.0.0.0 to 
   indicate a request for dynamic assignment of a HoA, or w.x.y.z to 
   indicate a preferred HoA at that TAA. Clearly, the DHA must ensure 
   that the resulting HoA is routable via the assigned TAA.

   If the RRQ(TAAR) is received at an FA-CC, then that FA will forward a 
   RRQ(TAAR) to the DHA-CC and the dynamic assignment of the TA and the
   HoA undertaken. 
    

   5.4 TAAG Protocol Rules

   An FA-CA sends a RRQ(TAAG) to the TA-CA, whether or not the MN issued 
   a RRQ(TAAR).

   The DHA sends the RRP(TAAG) to either the MN or the FA in response to 
   either a RRQ(TAAR) or RRQ(TAAG). The RRP(TAAG) indicates compliance 
   with this document and confirms the address of the assigned TA (along 
   with the associated HoA assignment information) to the TEN.

   The FA-CA or FA-CC that receives a RRP(TAAG) SHOULD forward a 
   RRP(TAAG) to the MN if that FA received a RRQ(TAAR) from the MN. 
   Otherwise, the FA MAY forward the RRQ(TAAR).


 6. IANA Considerations 
 
   6.1 Mobile IP Extension Type and Subtypes 
  
   This document introduces the following Mobile IP extension type. 
     
             Name       : Tunnel Agent Extensions
             Type Value : TBD 
             Section    : 6 
     
   This document also introduces two of the following subtypes for the 
   above extension type. 

             Sub-type  Name                             Section  
             --------  ----                             ------- 
                1      Tunnel Agent Address Request       6.1 
                2      Tunnel Agent Address Grant         6.2

   6.2 Mobile IP Error codes 
  
   This document introduces no new error codes that can be returned by 
   the FA or HA in a Mobile IP Registration Reply. However, such error 
   codes will no doubt be required as part of the design of TACP-CA and 
   are for further study.
     

 7. Security Considerations 
  
   The DHA in both decomposition schemes can be located in the 
   operations zone behind a firewall and so should be better 
   protected against DOS attacks.

   The TA-CC does not have a need to exchange signaling with MNs and 
   should therefore be better protected against DOS attacks.

   The decomposition of the DHA and the TA offers no new vulnerabilities 
   in the MIP signaling plane for TACP-CC, and any vulnerabilities for 
   TACP-CA have been previously discussed and addressed in regional MIP 
   signaling schemes where bindings are also installed in a node that is 
   situated between the HA and the TEN. However, all such 
   vulnerabilities will need to fully documented and protected against 
   in the TACP-CA design. 

   The TACP-CC decomposition clearly introduces a new signaling protocol 
   with associated vulnerabilities that can only be examined as part of 
   that protocol design. However, a clear need will exist to 
   authenticate and integrity protect TACP-CC messages and parameters to 
   avoid DHA-TA communications being corrupted. 

   The above mentioned procedure for Tunnel Agent address agreement, 
   that is common to both decomposition schemes, introduces the TAAR and 
   TAAG extensions which MUST be protected by an authorization-enabling 
   extension [2] between the MN and the HA. Thus, this procedure does 
   not introduce any new security concerns that are not otherwise 
   outlined above. 
  

 8. Backward Compatibility Considerations 

   These comments assume all MIP nodes compliant with this document are      
   able to revert to RFC3344 behavior.
  
   8.1 Legacy Home Agent 
  
   Upon receiving a RRQ(TAAR) from a MN following the procedure     
   outlined in this document, the legacy HA SHOULD follow the behavior     
   as per RFC 3344, ignoring the TAAR extension which has been defined 
   in the skippable range of extensions.

   A compliant FA will note that the TAAG is missing and MAY revert to 
          
 A.W.OÆNeill           Expires - January 12, 2005             [Page 14]
                   Decomposed Home Agent Architecture        July, 2004

   RFC3344 behavior. A complaint MN that sent a RRQ(TAAR) but did not 
   receive a RRP(TAAG) will be informed that the core network does not 
   support decomposition.

  
   8.2 Legacy Foreign Agent 
  
   For the cases where the RRQ(TAAR) is sent by a complaint MN with TAA 
   field set to 0.0.0.0 or a.b.c.d, the behavior of the legacy FA will 
   be the same as per RFC 3344, and the FA will not forward a RRQ(TAAR) 
   towards the HA. A compliant HA will not receive RRQ(TAAR) and hence 
   will not return a RRQ(TAAG). The HA will resort to RFC3344 behavior. 

  
   8.3 Legacy Mobile Node 
  
   A legacy MN that is using a FACoA may be supported by a compliant FA, 
   DHA, and TA combination in the core network whilst employing RFC3344 
   RRQ/RRPs. 
    
   The RRQ behavior of a legacy MN that uses a CCoA will not be affected, 
   since the new behavior will be applicable only for RRQs which include 
   the TAAR so indicating compliance with this specification. 

   The RRP behavior of a legacy MN that uses a CCoA is also not affected  
   by the receipt of an unsolicited TAAG as it is only sent to a MN that 
   has indicated compliance with this specification. It is also a   
   skippable extension and behavior will progress as per RFC 3344 if 
   incorrectly sent to a non-compliant MN as a result of a bug.
