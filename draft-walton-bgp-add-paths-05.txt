Abstract

   In this document we propose a BGP extension that allows the
   advertisement of multiple paths for the same address prefix without
   the new paths implicitly replacing any previous ones.  The essence of
   the extension is that each path is identified by a path identifier in
   addition to the address prefix.

INTERNET DRAFT      draft-walton-bgp-add-paths-05.txt      February 2006


1. Introduction

   The BGP specification [RFC4271] defines an "Update-Send Process" to
   advertise the routes chosen by the Decision Process to other BGP
   speakers.  No provisions are made to allow the advertisement of
   multiple paths for the same address prefix, or Network Layer
   Reachability Information (NLRI).  In fact, a route with the same NLRI
   as a previously advertised route implicitly replaces the previous
   advertisement.

   In this document we propose a BGP extension that allows the
   advertisement of multiple paths for the same address prefix without
   the new paths implicitly replacing any previous ones.  The essence of
   the extension is that each path is identified by a path identifier in
   addition to the address prefix.


2. Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3. How to Identify a Path

   As defined in [RFC4271], a path refers to the information reported in
   the path attribute field of an UPDATE message.  As the procedures
   specified in [RFC4271] allow only the advertisement of one path for a
   particular address prefix, a path for an address prefix from a BGP
   peer can be keyed on the address prefix.

   In order for a BGP speaker to advertise multiple paths for the same
   address prefix, a new identifier (termed "Path Identifier" hereafter)
   needs to be introduced so that a particular path for an address
   prefix can be identified by the combination of the address prefix and
   the Path Identifier.

   Depending on the application and the configuration of a particular
   peer, the Path Identifier for a path can be an AS number, or a BGP
   Identifier, or an opaque number, with which a path is associated by
   the BGP speaker that advertises the path.

4. Extended NLRI Encodings

   In order to carry the Path Identifier in an UPDATE message, the
   existing NLRI encodings specified in [RFC4271, RFC2858] are extended
   as the following:


               +-----------------------------+
               | Path Identifier (4 octets)  |
               +-----------------------------+
               | Length (1 octet)            |
               +-----------------------------+
               | Prefix (variable)           |
               +-----------------------------+


   and the NLRI encoding specified in [RFC3107] is extended as the
   following:


               +-----------------------------+
               | Path Identifier (4 octets)  |
               +-----------------------------+
               | Length (1 octet)            |
               +-----------------------------+
               | Label (3 octets)            |
               +-----------------------------+
                .........................
               +-----------------------------+
               | Prefix (variable)           |
               +-----------------------------+


   The extended NLRI encodings SHALL be used only when the Path
   Identifier needs to be carried in an UPDATE message. The usage of the
   extended NLRI encodings is specified in the Operation section.

5. ADD-PATH Capability

   The ADD-PATH Capability is a new BGP capability [RFC2842].  The
   Capability Code for this capability is specified in the IANA
   Considerations section of this document. The Capability Length field
   of this capability is variable. The Capability Value field consists
   of zero or more of the tuples <AFI, SAFI> as follows:


               +------------------------------------------------+
               | Address Family Identifier (2 octets)           |
               +------------------------------------------------+
               | Subsequent Address Family Identifier (1 octet) |
               +------------------------------------------------+


   The meaning and use of the fields are as follows:

       Address Family Identifier (AFI):

          This field carries the identity of the Network Layer protocol
          for which the BGP speaker intends to advertise multiple paths.
          Presently defined values for this field are specified in
          [IANA-AFI].

       Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI):

          This field provides additional information about the type of
          the Network Layer Reachability Information carried in the
          attribute. Presently defined values for this field are
          specified in [IANA-SAFI].


   When advertising the ADD-PATH Capability to a peer, a BGP speaker
   conveys to the peer that the speaker is capable of receiving multiple
   paths as well as the single path from the peer for address families
   that the speaker supports.

   When a tuple <AFI, SAFI> is included in the capability, it indicates
   that the BGP speaker intends to advertise multiple paths for the
   <AFI, SAFI>.  If the ADD-PATH Capability is also received from the
   peer, the speaker would then follow the procedures for advertising
   multiple paths to the peer for the specified <AFI, SAFI>.

6. Operation

   The Path Identifier specified in the previous section can be used to
   advertise multiple paths for the same address prefix without
   subsequent advertisements replacing the previous ones.  Apart from
   the fact that this is now doable, the route advertisement rules of
   [RFC4271] are not changed.  In particular, a new advertisement for a
   given address prefix and a given path identifier replaces a previous
   advertisement for the given address prefix and the given path
   identifier.

   A BGP speaker that has implemented the procedures for receiving
   multiple paths MAY advertise the ADD-PATH Capability to its peers
   using BGP Capabilities advertisement [RFC2842].  Whether a particular
   tuple <AFI, SAFI> is included in the capability depends on the the
   configuration, and whether the procedures for advertising multiple
   paths for the <AFI, SAFI> are implemented.

   A BGP speaker MUST follow the existing procedures in generating an
   UPDATE message for a particular <AFI, SAFI> to a peer unless the BGP
   speaker advertises the ADD-PATH Capability that includes the <AFI,
   SAFI>, and also receives the ADD-PATH Capability from the peer, in
   which case the speaker MUST generate a route update for the <AFI,
   SAFI> based on the combination of the address prefix and the Path
   Identifier, and use the extended NLRI encodings specified in this
   document.  The peer SHALL act accordingly in processing an UPDATE
   message related to a particular <AFI, SAFI>.


7. Applications

   The BGP extension specified in this document can be used by a BGP
   route reflector [RFC2796] or BGP Confederation ASBR [RFC3065] to
   advertise more than just the best path in order to eliminate
   persistent route oscillations [RFC3345], or to help achieve optimal
   routing in a network.

   Other applications are for further study.

8. Deployment Considerations

   The extension proposed in this document provides a mechanism for a
   BGP speaker to advertise multiple paths over a BGP session.  The
   extension is intended for use by only a small number of applications
   that require such a functionality.  Care needs to be taken in its
   deployment to ensure consistent routing and forwarding in a network.


9. IANA Considerations

   IANA needs to assign a capability number for the ADD-PATH Capability
   described in this document.


10. Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security concerns to BGP or other
   specifications referenced in this document.
