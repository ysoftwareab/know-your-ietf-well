Abstract

   Mobile IPv6 deployments may want to bootstrap their operations
   dynamically based on an interaction between the Home Agent and the
   Diameter server of the Mobile Service Provider (MSP).  This document
   specifies the interaction between a Mobile IP Home Agent and that
   Diameter server.

   Several different mechanisms for authenticating a Mobile Node are
   supported.  The usage of the Internet Key Exchange v2 (IKEv2)
   protocol allows different mechanisms, such as the Extensible
   Authentication Protocol (EAP), certificates and pre-shared secrets to
   be used.  Furthermore, another method makes use of the Mobile IPv6
   Authentication protocol.  In addition to authentication and
   authorization, the configuration of Mobile IPv6 specific parameters
   and accounting is specified in this document.

Internet-Draft      Diameter MIP6: HA-to-AAAH Support      February 2008


1.  Introduction

   Performing the Mobile IPv6 protocol [1], requires the Mobile Node
   (MN) to own a Home Address (HoA) and to have an assigned Home Agent
   (HA) to the MN.  The MN needs to register with the HA in order enable
   its reachability and mobility, when away from home.  The registration
   process itself requires establishment of IPSec security associations
   (SA) and cryptographic material between the MN and HA.  Providing the
   collection of home address, HA address and keying material is
   generally referred to as the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping problem [13].
   The purpose of this specification is to provide Diameter support for
   the interaction between the HA and the AAA server required to solve
   the bootstrapping problem in the split scenario [2] in a manner that
   satisfies the requirements defined in [14].

   From a mobility service provider (MSP) perspective, it is important
   to verify that the MN is authenticated and authorized to utilize
   Mobile IPv6 service and that such services are accounted for.  Only
   when the MN is authenticated and authorized, the MSP allows the
   bootstrapping of Mobile IPv6 parameters.  Thus, prior to processing
   the Mobile IPv6 registrations, the HA, participates in the
   authentication of the MN to verify the MN's identity.  The HA also
   participates in the Mobile IPv6 authorization process involving the
   Diameter infrastructure.  The HA, due to its role in traffic
   forwarding, may also perform accounting for the Mobile IPv6 service
   provided to the MN.

   This document enables the following functionality:

   Authentication:  Asserting or helping with assertion of the
      correctness of the MN identity.  As a Diameter client supporting
      the new Diameter Mobile IPv6 application, the HA may need to
      support more than one authentication type depending on the
      environment.  Although the authentication is performed by the AAA
      server there is an impact for the HA as different set of command
      codes are needed for the respective authentication procedures.

   Authorization:  The HA must verify that the user is authorized to use
      the Mobile IPv6 service using the assistance of the MSP Diameter
      servers.  This is accomplished through the use of new Diameter
      commands specifically designed for performing Mobile IPv6
      authorization decisions.  This document defines these commands and
      requires the HA to support them and to participate in this
      authorization signaling.

   Accounting:  For accounting purposes and capacity planning, it is
      required of the HA to provide accounting report to the Diameter
      infrastructure and thus to support the related Diameter accounting
      procedures.

                      Figure 1: Architecture Overview

   Mobile IPv6 signaling between the MN and the HA can protected using
   two different mechanisms, namely using IPSec and via the MIPv6
   Authentication Protocol [3].  The important aspect is, however, that
   for these two approaches several different authentication and key
   exchange solutions are available.  To establish IPSec security
   associations, protecting of Mobile IPv6 signaling messages IKEv2 is
   used [4].  IKEv2 supports EAP-based authentication, certificates and
   pre-shared secrets.  For protecting using the MIPv6 Authentication
   Protocol [3] a mechanism has been designed that is very similar to
   the one used by Mobile IPv4.

   The ability to use different credentials has an impact on the
   interaction between the HA (acting as a Diameter client) and the
   Diameter Server.  For that reason this document illustrates the usage
   of these authentication mechanisms with different subsections for:

   o  IKEv2 usage with EAP
   o  IKEv2 usage with certificates and pre-shared secrets
   o  MIPv6 Authentication Protocol

   For accounting of Mobile IPv6 services provided to the MN, this
   specification uses the accounting application defined in [5].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [6].

   The MIPv6 bootstrapping terminology is taken from [13].


3.  Advertising Application Support

   Diameter nodes conforming to this specification MUST advertise
   support by including the Diameter Mobile IPv6 Application ID value of
   [TO BE ASSIGNED BY IANA] in the Auth-Application-Id AVP of the
   Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-Answer
   command [5].  The Acct-Application-id AVP needs to include the
   Diameter Base Accounting Application ID value of 3 (to support the
   split accounting model [15]).


4.  Protocol Description

4.1.  Support for Mobile IPv6 with IKEv2 and EAP

   The use of IKEv2 with EAP between the MN and the HA allows the AAA to
   authenticate the MN.  When EAP is used with IKEv2, the Diameter EAP
   application, as defined in [7], is re-used.  EAP methods that do not
   establish a shared key SHOULD NOT be used, as they are subject to a
   number of man-in-the-middle attacks as stated in Section 2.16 and
   Section 5 of RFC 4306 [8].  AVPs specific to Mobile IPv6
   bootstrapping are added to the EAP application commands.

   Figure 2 shows the message flow involved during the authentication
   phase when EAP is used.

          Figure 2: Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping using IKEv2 and EAP

   The MN and the HA start the interaction with an IKE_SA_INIT exchange.

Internet-Draft      Diameter MIP6: HA-to-AAAH Support      February 2008


   In this phase cryptographic algorithms are negotiated, nonces and
   Diffie-Hellman parameters are exchanged.  Message (3) starts the
   IKE_AUTH phase.  This second phase authenticates the previous
   messages, exchanges identities and certificates and establishes the
   first CHILD_SA.  It is used to mutually authenticate the MN (acting
   as an IKEv2 Initiator) and the HA (acting as an IKEv2 Responder).
   The identity of the user/MN is provided in the IDi field.  The MN
   indicates its willingness to be authenticated via EAP by omitting the
   AUTH field in message (3) (see Section 2.16 of [8]).

   As part of the authentication process, the MN MAY request a Home-
   Address, a Home Prefix or suggests one, see [4], using a CFG_REQUEST
   payload in the message (3).

   The HA extracts the IDi field from the message (3) and sends a
   Diameter-EAP-Request (DER) message (4) towards the authenticating
   Diameter server.  The EAP-Payload AVP contains a EAP-Response/
   Identity with the identity extracted from the IDi field.

   This message is routed to the MNs Diameter server/EAP server.  The
   Diameter server selects the EAP method and replies with the DEA
   Message.  Depending on the type of EAP method chosen, a number of DER
   and DEA messages carry the method specific exchanges between the MN
   and the Diameter server/EAP server.

   At the end of the EAP authentication phase, the Diameter server
   indicates the result of the authentication in the Result-Code AVP and
   provides the corresponding EAP packet (EAP Success or EAP Failure).
   The last IKEv2 message sent by the HA contains the Home Address or
   the Home Prefix.  In the latter case, a CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange is
   necessary to setup IPSec SAs for Mobile IPv6 signaling.

   In some deployment scenario, the HA may also acts as a IKEv2
   Responder for IPSec VPN access.  A problem in this case is that the
   IKEv2 responder may not know if IKEv2 is used for MIP6 service or for
   IPSec VPN access.  The IKEv2 responder may A network operator needs
   to be aware of this limitation.

   Eventually, when the HA receives a Binding Update (BU), the HA
   authenticates and authorizes the MN.  It is RECOMMENDED that the HA
   sends an accounting request message every time it receives a BU.

4.2.  Support for Mobile IPv6 with IKEv2 and Certificates

   When IKEv2 is used with certificate-based authentication, the
   Diameter NASREQ application [9] is used to authorize the MN for the
   Mobile IPv6 service.  The IDi payload extracted from the IKE_AUTH
   message MUST correspond to the identity in the MN's certificate.

   This identity is then used by the Home Agent to populate the User-
   Name AVP in the succeeding AA-Request message.  Further PKI-related
   procedures such as certificate revocation checking are out of scope
   of this document.

4.3.  Support for Mobile IPv6 with IKEv2 and Pre-Shared Secrets

   When IKEv2 is used with PSK-based initiator authentication, the
   Diameter NASREQ application [9] is re-used to authorize the MN for
   the Mobile IPv6 service.  The IDi payload extracted from the IKE_AUTH
   message has to contain an identity that is meaningful for the
   Diameter infrastructure, such as a Network Access Identifier (NAI),
   and is then used by the Home Agent to populate the User-Name AVP in
   the succeeding AA-Request message.

4.4.  Support for the Mobile IPv6 Authentication Protocol

   Figure 3 shows the message sequence between the MN, the HA and the
   Diameter server during the registration when MIPv6 Authentication
   Protocol is used.  BU and Binding Acknowledgement (BA) messages are
   used in the binding registration process.  This exchange triggers the
   Diameter interaction.

   According to [3] the MN uses the Mobile Node Identifier Option,
   specifically the MN-NAI mobility option (as defined in [16]) to
   identify itself.

   Receiving the BU at the HA initiates a MIP6-Request-Message to the
   Diameter server, which in turn responds with a MIP6-Answer-Message.
   The Home Agent also provides the assigned Home Address to the
   Diameter server in the MIP-Mobile-Node-Address AVP.

   The procedure described here for the Mobile IPv6 Authentication
   Protocol is only needed for the initial BU received by the HA.  When
   the HA receives subsequent BUs, they are processed locally in the HA.
   It is RECOMMENDED that the HA sends an accounting request message
   every time it receives a Binding Update.

4.5.  Mobile IPv6 Session Management

   The Diameter server may maintain state or may be stateless.  This is
   indicated in the Auth-Session-State AVP (or its absence).  The HA
   MUST support the Authorization Session State Machine defined in [5].
   Moreover, the following four commands may be exchanged between the HA
   and the Diameter server.

4.5.1.  Session-Termination-Request

   The Session-Termination-Request (STR) message [5] is sent by the HA
   to inform the Diameter server that an authorized session is being
   terminated.

4.5.2.  Session-Termination-Answer

   The Session-Termination-Answer (STA) message [5] is sent by the
   Diameter server to acknowledge the notification that the session has
   been terminated.

4.5.3.  Abort-Session-Request

   The Abort-Session-Request (ASR) message [5] is sent by the Diameter
   server to terminate the session.  This fulfills one of the
   requirement described in [14].

Internet-Draft      Diameter MIP6: HA-to-AAAH Support      February 2008


4.5.4.  Abort-Session-Answer

   The Abort-Session-Answer (ASA) message [5] is sent by the Home Agent
   in response to an ASR message.

4.6.  Accounting for Mobile IPv6 services

   The HA MUST be able act as a Diameter client collecting accounting
   records needed for service control and charging.  The HA MUST support
   the accounting procedures (specifically the command codes mentioned
   below) and the Accounting Session State Machine as defined in [5].
   The command codes, exchanged between the HA and Diameter server for
   accounting purposes, are provided in the following subsections.

   The Diameter application design guideline [15] defines two separate
   models for accounting:

   Split accounting model:

      According to this model, the accounting messages use the Diameter
      base accounting application ID (value of 3).  Since accounting is
      treated as an independent application, accounting commands may be
      routed separately from the rest of application messages and thus
      the accounting messages generally end up in a central accounting
      server.  Since Diameter Mobile IPv6 application does not define
      its own unique accounting commands, this is the preferred choice,
      since it permits use of centralized accounting for several
      applications.

   Coupled accounting model:

      In this model, the accounting messages will use the application ID
      of the Mobile IPv6 application.  This means that accounting
      messages will be routed like any other Mobile IPv6 application
      messages.  This requires the Diameter server in charge of Mobile
      IPv6 application to handle the accounting records (e.g., sends
      them to a proper accounting server).

   As mentioned above, the preferred choice is to use the split
   accounting model and thus to choose Diameter base accounting
   application ID (value of 3) for accounting messages.

4.6.1.  Accounting-Request

   The Accounting-Request command [5] is sent by the HA to the Diameter
   server to exchange accounting information regarding the MN with the
   Diameter server.

4.6.2.  Accounting-Answer

   The Accounting-Answer command [5] is sent by the Diameter server to
   the HA to acknowledge receiving an Accounting-Request.

   set to TBD and the 'R' bit set in the Command Flags field, is sent by
   the HA, acting as a Diameter client, in order to request the
   authentication and authorization of a MN.

   Although the HA provides the Diameter server with a replay protection
   related information, the HA is responsible for the replay protection.

   The message format is shown below.

             AVPs for the Mobile IPv6 Authentication Protocol

   Note 1: The MIP6-Feature-Vector is defined in Section 4.7.4 of [10].

   Note 2: The QoS-Capability and QoS-Resource AVPs are defined in
   Sections 4.1 and 4.3 of [11].

6.1.  User-Name AVP

   The User-Name AVP (AVP Code 1) is of type UTF8String and contains an
   NAI extracted from the MN-NAI mobility option included in the
   received BU message.  Alternatively, the NAI can be extracted from
   the IKEv2 IDi payload included in the IKE_AUTH message sent by the
   IKE initiator.

6.2.  Called-Station-Id AVP

   The Called-Station-Id AVP (AVP Code 30) is of type UTF8String and
   contains the string extracted from the IKEv2 IDr payload, if
   available in the IKE_AUTH message sent by the IKE initiator.

6.3.  MIP-MN-AAA-SPI AVP

   The MIP-MN-AAA-SPI AVP (AVP Code 341) is of type Unsigned32 and
   contains an SPI code extracted from the Mobility Message
   Authentication Option included in the received BU message.

   This AVP is re-used from [12].

6.4.  MIP-MN-HA-SPI AVP

   The MIP-MN-HA-SPI AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32 and
   contains an SPI code provided by the Diameter server for the Mobile
   IPv6 MN-HA Authentication Option.

6.5.  MIP-Mobile-Node-Address AVP

   The MIP-Mobile-Node-Address AVP (AVP Code 333) is of type Address and
   contains the Home Agent assigned IPv6 Home Address of the Mobile
   Node.

   If the MIP-Mobile-Node-Address AVP contains unspecified IPv6 address
   (0::0) in a request message, then the Home Agent expects the Diameter
   server to assign the Home Address in a subsequent reply message.  In
   case the Diameter server assigns only a Home Network Prefix to the
   Mobile Node the lower 64 bits of the MIP-Mobile-Node-Address AVP
   provided address MUST be set to zero.

   This AVP is re-used from [12].

6.6.  MIP-Home-Agent-Address AVP

   The MIP-Home-Agent-Address AVP (AVP Code 334) is of type Address and
   contains the IPv6 address of the Home Agent.  The Home Agent address
   is the same as in the received BU message that triggered the
   authentication and authorization procedure towards the Diameter
   server.  This AVP is re-used from [12].

6.7.  MIP-Careof-Address AVP

   The MIP-Careof-Address AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Address and
   contains the IPv6 Care-of Address of the Mobile Node.  The Home Agent
   extracts this IP address from the received BU message.

6.8.  MIP-Authenticator AVP

   The MIP-Authenticator AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type OctetString and
   contains the Authenticator Data from the received BU message.  The
   Home Agent extracts this data from the MN-AAA Mobility Message
   Authentication Option included in the received BU message.

6.9.  MIP-MAC-Mobility-Data AVP

   The MIP-MAC-Mobility-Data AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type OctetString
   and contains the calculated MAC_Mobility_Data, as defined in [3].

6.10.  MIP-Session-Key AVP

   The MIP-Session-Key AVP (AVP Code 343) is of type OctetString and
   contains the MN-HA shared secret (i.e., the session key) for the
   associated Mobile IPv6 MH-HA authentication option.  When the
   Diameter server computes the session key it is placed in this AVP.

   The MIP-Session-Key AVP may also be used to convey a pre-shared
   secret when IKEv2 is used with PSK-based initiator authentication.

   This AVP is re-used from [12].

6.11.  MIP-MSA-Lifetime AVP

   The MIP-MSA-Lifetime AVP (AVP Code 367) is of type Unsigned32 and
   represents the period of time (in seconds) for which the session key
   (see Section 6.10) is valid.  The associated session key MUST NOT be
   used if the lifetime has expired.

   This AVP is re-used from [12].

6.12.  MIP-MN-HA-MSA AVP

   The MIP-MN-HA-MSA AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Grouped and contains
   the session related information for use with the MIPv6 Authentication
   Protocol.


   MIP-MN-HA-MSA ::= < AVP Header: TBD >

                   * [ AVP ]

6.13.  MIP-Algorithm-Type AVP

   The MIP-Algorithm-Type AVP (AVP Code 345) is of type Enumerated and
   contains Algorithm identifier for the associated Mobile IPv6 MN-HA
   Authentication Option.  The Diameter server selects the algorithm
   type.  Existing algorithm types are defined in RFC 4004 that also
   fulfill current RFC 4285 requirements.

   This AVP is re-used from [12].

6.14.  MIP-Replay-Mode AVP

   The MIP-Replay-Mode AVP (AVP Code 346) is of type Enumerated and
   contains the replay mode the Home Agent for authenticating the mobile
   node.  The replay modes, defined in RFC 4004 [12], are supported.

   This AVP is re-used from [12].

6.15.  MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP

   This AVP is defined in [10].  This document defines a new capability
   bit for signaling the support of Mobile IPv6 route optimization.  The
   following capability is defined in this document:

   RO_SUPPORTED (0x0000000800000000)

      Route optimization is supported.  When the Home Agent sets this
      bit, it indicates support for the route optimization.  If this bit
      is unset in the returned Mobility-Capability AVP, the AAAH does
      not authorize route optimization for the MN.

      In a case the Home Agent or the AAAH cannot authorize the use of
      route optimization then the Home Agent SHOULD send a Binding

      Acknowledgement with a Status Code set to
      ACCEPTED_BUT_NO_ROUTE_OPTIMIZATION (status code TBD).  This Status
      Code indicates that the binding registration succeeded but the
      Home Agent will fail all possible subsequent route optimization
      attempts because of subscription or operator policy.

   USER_TRAFFIC_ENCRYPTION (0x0000000100000000)

      User plane traffic encryption is supported.  When the Home Agent
      sets this bit, it indicates support for the user plane traffic
      encryption between the MN and the Home Agent.  If this bit is
      unset in the returned Mobility-Capability AVP, the AAAH does not
      authorize user plane traffic encryption for the MN because of
      subscription or operator policy.

      In the case the AAAH cannot authorize the use of route
      optimization then the Home Agent SHOULD send a Binding
      Acknowledgement with a Status Code set to
      ACCEPTED_BUT_NO_TRAFFIC_ENCRYPTION (status code TBD).  This Status
      Code indicates that the binding registration succeeded but the
      Home Agent will silently discard all encrypted user plane packets
      sent by the MN to the Home Agent.

6.16.  MIP-Timestamp AVP

   The MIP-Timestamp AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Time and may contain
   the timestamp value from the Mobility message replay protection
   option, defined in [3].  The Home Agent extracts this value from the
   received BU message, if available.

6.17.  QoS-Capability AVP

   The QoS-Capability AVP is defined in [11] and contains a list of
   supported Quality of Service profiles.

6.18.  QoS-Resources AVP

   The QoS-Resources AVP is defined in [11] and provides QoS and packet
   filtering capabilities.

6.19.  Coupled Accounting Model Accounting AVPs

   Diameter Mobile IPv6 application is used in the case of the coupled
   account model.  Diameter Mobile IPv4 application [12] accounting AVPs
   are reused in this document.  The following AVPs MUST be included in
   the accounting request message:

   o  Accounting-Input-Octets: Number of octets in IP packets received
      from the mobile node.
   o  Accounting-Output-Octets: Number of octets in IP packets sent by
      the mobile node
   o  Accounting-Input-Packets: Number of IP packets received from the
      mobile node.
   o  Accounting-Output-Packets: Number of IP packets sent by the mobile
      node.
   o  Acct-Multi-Session-Id: Used to link together multiple related
      accounting sessions, where each session would have a unique
      Session-Id, but the same Acct-Multi-Session-Id AVP.
   o  Acct-Session-Time: Indicates the length of the current session in
      seconds.
   o  MIP6-Feature-Vector: The supported features for this mobility
      service session.
   o  MIP-Mobile-Node-Address: The Home Address of the mobile node.
   o  MIP-Home-Agent-Address: The current home agent of the mobile node.

   Other APVs that SHOULD be included in the accounting request message
   include:

   o  QoS-Resources: Assigned QoS resources for the mobile node.
   o  QoS-Capability: The QoS capability related to the assigned QoS-
      Resources.
   o  MIP-Careof-Address: The current Care-of Address of the mobile
      node.


7.  Result-Code AVP Values

   This section defines new Result-Code [5] values that MUST be
   supported by all Diameter implementations that conform to this
   specification.

7.1.  Permanent Failures

   Errors that fall within the permanent failures category are used to
   inform the peer that the request failed and SHOULD NOT be attempted
   again.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This section contains the namespaces that have either been created in
   this specification or had their values assigned to existing
   namespaces managed by IANA.

9.1.  Command Codes

   IANA is requested to allocate a command code value for the MIP6-
   Request-Message (MRM) and for the MIP6-Answer-Message (MAM) from the
   Command Code namespace defined in [5].  See Section 5 for the
   assignment of the namespace in this specification.

9.2.  AVP Codes

   This specification requires IANA to register the following new AVPs
   from the AVP Code namespace defined in [5].






Korhonen, et al.         Expires August 28, 2008               [Page 28]

Internet-Draft      Diameter MIP6: HA-to-AAAH Support      February 2008


   o  MIP-Careof-Address
   o  MIP-Authenticator
   o  MIP-MAC-Mobility-Data
   o  MIP-Timestamp
   o  MIP-MN-HA-SPI
   o  MIP-MN-HA-MSA

   The AVPs are defined in Section 6.

9.3.  Result-Code AVP Values

   This specification requests IANA to allocate new values to the
   Result-Code AVP (AVP Code 268) namespace defined in [5].  See
   Section 7 for the assignment of the namespace in this specification.

9.4.  Application Identifier

   This specification requires IANA to allocate a new value for
   "Diameter Mobile IPv6" from the Application Identifier namespace
   defined in [5].

9.5.  Namespaces

   This specification defines a new value to the Mobility Capability
   registry (see [10]) for use with the MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP:

   Token                            | Value                | Description
   ---------------------------------+----------------------+------------
   RO_SUPPORTED                     | 0x0000000800000000   | RFC TBD
   USER_TRAFFIC_ENCRYPTION          | 0x0000000100000000   | RFC TBD

9.6.  Mobile IPv6 Status Codes

   This specification defines a new Mobile IPv6 [1] Status Code value.
   The Status Code must be allocated from the range 0-127:

   Status Code                             | Value         | Description
   ----------------------------------------+---------------+------------
   ACCEPTED_BUT_NO_ROUTE_OPTIMIZATION      | is set to TBD | RFC TBD
   ACCEPTED_BUT_NO_TRAFFIC_ENCRYPTION      | is set to TBD | RFC TBD


10.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the Diameter interaction required to
   accomplish the split scenario are described in in [2].  Additionally,
   the security considerations of the Diameter Base protocol [5],
   Diameter EAP application [7] are applicable to this document.  This
