Abstract

   This memo defines a new Relay Agent Remote-ID option for the Dynamic
   Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6).  This option is the
   DHCPv6 equivalent for the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for
   IPv4 (DHCPv4) Relay Agent Option's Remote-ID suboption as specified
   in RFC 3046.

Internet-Draft            Relay Agent Remote ID               April 2005


1.  Introduction

   DHCPv6 [1] provides IP addresses and configuration information for
   IPv6 clients.  It includes a relay agent capability, in which
   processes within the network infrastructure receive multicast
   messages from clients and relay them to DHCPv6 servers.  In some
   network environments, it will be useful for the relay agent to add
   information to the DHCPv6 message before relaying it.

   The information that relay agents supply can also be used in the
   server's decision making about the addresses, delegated prefixes [4],
   and configuration parameters that the client is to receive.

   The memo specifies the DHCPv6 equivalent of the DHCPv4 Relay Agent
   option's Remote-ID suboption as specified in [2].  The motivation and
   usage scenarios are provided in [2].

2.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [3].

3.  The Relay Agent Remote-ID Option

   This option MAY be added by DHCPv6 relay agents which terminate
   switched or permanent circuits and have mechanisms to identify the
   remote host end of the circuit.  The remote-id field MAY be used to
   encode, for instance:

   o  a "caller ID" telephone number for dial-up connection
   o  a "user name" prompted for by a Remote Access Server
   o  a remote caller ATM address
   o  a "modem ID" of a cable data modem
   o  the remote IP address of a point-to-point link
   o  a remote X.25 address for X.25 connections
   o  an interface identity, which might be the switch's DUID [1]
      suffixed by the interface-id from the DHCPv6 Interface-Id option.

   The remote ID MUST be globally unique.

   The format of the DHCPv6 Relay Agent Remote-ID option is shown below:

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |       OPTION_REMOTE_ID        |         option-len            |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       .                                                               .
       .                           remote-id                           .
       .                                                               .
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

         option-code      OPTION_REMOTE_ID (TBD)

         option-len       length, in octets, of the remote-id field.
                          The minimum length is 1 octet.

         remote-id        The opaque value for the globally unique
                          remote-id.


4.  DHCPv6 Relay Agent Behavior

   DHCPv6 relay agents MAY be configured to include a Remote-ID option
   in relayed (RELAY-FORW) DHCPv6 messages.

5.  DHCPv6 Server Behavior

   This option provides additional information to the DHCPv6 server.
   The DHCPv6 server, if it is configured to support this option, MAY
   use this information to select parameters specific to particular
   users, hosts, or subscriber modems.  The remote-id SHOULD be
   considered an opaque value, with policies based on exact string match
   only; that is, the option SHOULD NOT be internally parsed by the
   server.

   There is no requirement that a server return this option and its data
   in a RELAY-REPLY message.

6.  Security Considerations

   See [1] section 21.1, on securing DHCPv6 messages sent between
   servers and relay agents, and section 23, on general DHCPv6 security
   considerations. [2] discusses how this information can be used to
   enhance trust in some environments.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a DHCPv6 option code for the Relay Agent
   Remote-ID Option.
