1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework  
    
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current 
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of 
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
    
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are generally 
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). 
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the 
   Structure of Management Information (SMI). This memo specifies a MIB 
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, 
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 
   [RFC2580] 
    
2. Overview 
    
   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) 
   for managing the Open Shortest Path First Routing Protocol for IPv6 
   [RFC5340], otherwise known as OSPF version 3 (OSPFv3). Though the 
   fundamental mechanisms of OSPF version 2 (OSPFv2) [RFC2328] remain 
   unchanged in OSPFv3, some changes were necessary due to differences 
   in IP address size and in protocol semantics between IPv4 and IPv6. 
   In many cases, where the protocol operations have not changed from 
   OSPFv2, the specification for OSPFv3 does not restate the details, 
   but instead refers to the relevant sections in the OSPFv2 
   specification. This MIB follows along the same lines and includes 
   Reference clauses referring to the OSPFv2 specification when 
   applicable. 
    
   2.1. IPv6 Interfaces 
    
   IPv6 interfaces attach to links [RFC2460]. A link is roughly defined 
   as the layer below IPv6 (e.g. Ethernet, IPv4 Tunnel). One or more 
   IPv6 prefixes can be associated with an IPv6 interface. IPv6 
   interfaces and the prefixes associated with those interfaces can be 
   configured via the IP-MIB [RFC4293]. IPv6 interfaces are configured 
   in the IPv6 Interface Table and IPv6 prefixes are configured in the 
   Internet Address Prefix Table. An IPv6 interface is identified by a 
   unique index value. IPv6 Address Prefix Table entries associated with 
   an IPv6 interface reference the interface's index. 
    
   Whereas an interface identifier in OSPFv2 is a local IPv4 address or 
   MIB-2 interface index, an OSPFv3 interface identifier is an IPv6 
   interface index. For example, the index value of an OSPFv3 Interface 
   Table entry is the IPv6 interface index of the IPv6 interface over 
   which OSPFv3 is configured to operate. 
    
   2.2. Addressing Semantics 
    
   Router ID, Area ID and Link State ID remain at the OSPFv2 size of 32 
   bits. To ensure uniqueness, a router running both IPv4 and IPv6

                              OSPFv3 MIB                 June 23, 2009 
 
 
   concurrently can continue to use a local IPv4 host address, 
   represented as an unsigned 32-bit value, as the OSPFv3 Router ID. 
   Otherwise, the Router ID must be selected using another method (e.g. 
   administratively assigned). 
    
   Router ID, Area ID and Link State ID do not have addressing semantics 
   in OSPFv3, so their syntax is changed to Unsigned32. The Router ID 
   index component comes before the Link State ID index component in the 
   OSPFv3 MIB because the lack of addressing semantics in Link State IDs 
   make them less unique identifiers than the Router ID. It is more 
   useful to do partial OID lookups extending to the Router ID rather 
   than the Link State ID. 
     
   2.3. Authentication 
    
   In OSPFv3, authentication has been removed from the protocol itself. 
   MIB objects related to authentication are not carried forward from 
   the OSPFv2 MIB. 
    
   2.4. Type of Service 
    
   OSPFv2 MIB objects related to Type of Service (ToS) are not carried 
   forward to the OSPFv3 MIB.  
    
   2.5. Flooding Scope 
    
   Flooding scope for LSAs has been generalized and is now explicitly 
   encoded in the LSA's LS type field. The action to take upon receipt 
   of unknown LSA types is also encoded in the LS type field [RFC5340]. 
   The OSPFv3 MIB defines three Link State Database tables, one each 
   for Area-scope LSAs, Link-scope LSAs and AS-scope LSAs. 
    
   2.6. Virtual Links 
    
   Since addressing semantics have been removed from router-LSAs in 
   OSPFv3, Virtual Links now need to be assigned an interface ID for 
   advertisement in Hello packets and in router-LSAs. A read-only 
   object has been added to the Virtual Interface Table entry to view 
   the assigned interface ID. 
 
   2.7. Neighbors 
 
   The OSPFv3 Neighbor Table is a read-only table that contains 
   information learned from Hellos received from neighbors, including 
   configured neighbors. The OSPFv3 Configured Neighbor Table contains 
   entries for manually configured neighbors for use on NBMA and 
   Point-to-Multipoint interface types. 
 
   2.8. OSPFv3 Counters 
    
   This MIB defines several counters, namely: 
    
      - ospfv3OriginateNewLsas, ospfv3RxNewLsas in the

        ospfv3GeneralGroup 
      - ospfv3AreaSpfRuns, ospfv3AreaNssaTranslatorEvents in the 
        ospfv3AreaTable 
      - ospfv3IfEvents in the ospfv3IfTable 
      - ospfv3VirtIfEvents in the ospfv3VirtIfTable 
      - ospfv3NbrEvents in the ospfv3NbrTable 
      - ospfv3VirtNbrEvents in the ospfv3VirtNbrTable 
    
   As a best practice, a management entity, when reading these counters, 
   should use the discontinuity object, ospfv3DiscontinuityTime, to 
   determine if an event that would invalidate the management entity 
   understanding of the counters has occurred. A restart of the OSPFv3 
   routing process is a possible example of a discontinuity event. 
    
   2.9. Multiple OSPFv3 Instances 
    
   SNMPv3 supports "Contexts" that can be used to implement MIB views on 
   multiple OSPFv3 instances on the same system.  See [RFC3411] or its 
   successors for details. 
    
   2.10. Notifications 
 
   Notifications define a set of notifications, objects, and mechanisms 
   to enhance the ability to manage IP internetworks that use OSPFv3 as 
   their Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP).   
 
   2.11 Conventions 
 
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and 
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in 
   RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 
    
3. OSPFv3 Notification Overview 
    
   3.1. Introduction 
    
      OSPFv3 is an event-driven routing protocol, where an event can be 
      a change in an OSPFv3 interface's link-level status, the 
      expiration of an OSPFv3 timer, or the reception of an OSPFv3 
      protocol packet. Many of the actions that OSPFv3 takes as a result 
      of these events will result in a change of the routing topology. 
    
      As routing topologies become large and complex, it is often 
      difficult to locate the source of a topology change or 
      unpredicted routing path by polling a large number or routers. 
      Because of the difficulty of polling a large number of devices, 
      a more prudent approach is for devices to notify a network manager 
      of potentially critical OSPF events using SNMP notifications. 
    
   3.2 Ignoring Initial Activity 
    
      The majority of critical events occur when OSPFv3 is enabled on a 
  
Internet Draft        Expires December 25, 2009              [Page 5] 
                              OSPFv3 MIB                 June 23, 2009 
 
 
      router, at which time the designated router is elected and 
      neighbor adjacencies are formed. During this initial period, a 
      potential flood of notifications is unnecessary since the 
      events are expected. To avoid unnecessary notifications, a 
      router should not originate expected OSPFv3 interface-related 
      notifications until two of that interface's dead timer intervals 
      have elapsed. The expected OSPFv3 interface notifications are 
      ospfv3IfStateChange, ospfv3VirtIfStateChange, 
      ospfv3NbrStateChange, and ospfv3VirtNbrStateChange. 
    
   3.3 Throttling Notifications 
    
      The mechanism for throttling the notifications is similar to 
      the mechanism explained in RFC 1224 [RFC1224]. The basic premise 
      of the throttling mechanism is that of a sliding window, defined 
      in seconds and an upper bound on the number of notifications that 
      may be generated within this window. Note that unlike RFC 1224, 
      notifications are not sent to inform the network manager that the 
      throttling mechanism has kicked in. 
    
      A single window should be used to throttle all OSPFv3 
      notifications types except for the ospfv3LsdbOverflow and the 
      ospfv3LsdbApproachingOverflow notifications, which should not be 
      throttled. For example, with a window time of 3, an upper bound 
      of 3, and events to cause notifications 1, 2, 3, and 4 (4 
      notifications within a 3-second period), the 4th notification 
      should not be generated. 
    
      Appropriate values are 7 notifications with a window time of 
      10 seconds. 
    
   3.4 One Notification Per OSPFv3 Event 
    
      Several of the notifications defined in this MIB are generated as 
      the result of finding an unusual condition while parsing an OSPFv3 
      packet or a processing a timer event. There may be more than one 
      unusual condition detected while handling the event. For example, 
      a link state update packet may contain several retransmitted link 
      state advertisements (LSAs), or a retransmitted database 
      description packet may contain several database description 
      entries. To limit the number of notifications and variables, 
      OSPFv3 should generate at most one notification per OSPFv3 event. 
      Only the variables associated with the first unusual 
      condition should be included with the notification. Similarly, if 
      more than one type of unusual condition is encountered while 
      parsing the packet, only the first event will generate a 
      notification. 
    
   3.5 Polling Event Counters 
    
      Many of the tables in the OSPFv3 MIB contain generalized event 
      counters. By enabling the notifications defined in this document, 
      a network manager can obtain more specific information about these

      events. A network manager may want to poll these event counters 
      and enable OSPFv3 notifications when a particular counter starts 
      increasing abnormally. 
    
4. Structure of the OSPFv3 MIB 
    
   The MIB is composed of the following sections: 
    
        General Variables

6. Security Considerations 
    
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module 
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such 
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
   network operations. Improper manipulation of the objects represented 
   by this MIB may result in disruption of network connectivity by 
   administratively disabling the entire OSPFv3 entity or individual

   interfaces, by deleting configured neighbors, by reducing the limit 
   on External LSAs, by changing ASBR status, by manipulating route 
   aggregation, by manipulating interface and route metrics, by changing 
   hello interval or dead interval, or by changing interface type. 
   Remote monitoring can be defeated by disabling of SNMP notifications. 
   Performance can be impacted by increasing the limit on External LSAs 
   or changing DR/BDR priority.  
    
   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a 
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or 
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to 
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly 
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over 
   the network via SNMP. Unauthorized access to readable objects in this 
   MIB allows the discovery of the network topology and operating 
   parameters which can be used to target further attacks on the network 
   or to gain a competitive business advantage. 
    
   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), 
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is 
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects 
   in this MIB module. 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as 
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), 
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for 
   authentication and privacy). 
    
   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to 
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate 
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them. 
 
7. IANA Considerations 
 
   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned 
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry: 
    
        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value 
        ----------        ----------------------- 
    
        ospfv3MIB           { mib-2 YYY } 
    
   [Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication):  the IANA is 
   requested to assign a value for "YYY" under the 'mib-2' subtree and 
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the 
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "YYY" 
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove 
   this note.]
