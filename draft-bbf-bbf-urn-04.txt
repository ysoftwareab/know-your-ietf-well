       Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespaces for Broadband Forum
                          draft-bbf-bbf-urn-04

Abstract

   This document describes the Namespace Identifiers (NIDs) 'bbf',
   'broadband-forum-org', and 'dslforum-org' for Uniform Resource Names
   (URNs) used to identify resources published by Broadband Forum (BBF).
   BBF specifies and manages resources that utilize these three URN
   identification models.  Management activities for these and other
   resource types are handled by BBF.

1.  Introduction

   Broadband Forum (BBF) is a non-profit industry alliance driving
   broadband wireline solutions and empowering converged packet networks
   worldwide to better meet the needs of vendors, service providers and
   their customers.  BBF develops multi-service broadband packet
   networking specifications addressing interoperability, architecture
   and management.  Its work enables home, business and converged
   broadband services; encompassing customer, access and backbone
   networks.

   Occasionally, BBF specification efforts require identifiers in a
   managed namespace so that they are unique and persistent.  To ensure
   that the uniqueness is absolute, the registration of three specific
   Uniform Resource Name (URN) [RFC2141] Namespace IDs (NID) for use by
   BBF are being specified in this document, in full conformance with
   the NID registration process specified in [RFC3406].

   The 'bbf' NID is for new work efforts related to data models for
   protocols other than its CPE WAN Management Protocol (CWMP) [TR-069].
   The 'broadband-forum-org' and 'dslforum-org' NIDs are used for all
   data models related to CWMP [TR-069].  BBF has used these latter two
   NIDs for many years without formally registering them and has
   published widely-implemented specifications that use these NIDs.  Use

   of the 'dslforum-org' NID started prior the organization's 2008 name
   change from DSL Forum to Broadband Forum.

2.  bbf Registration

   Namespace ID:

      bbf

   Registration Information:

      registration version number: 1
      registration date: YYYY-MM-DD [RFC Editor: Please replace YYYY-MM-
      DD with the date of approval of this document for publication as
      an RFC.]

   Declared registrant of the namespace:

      Registering organization

   Declaration of syntactic structure:

      The syntax of namespace specific strings for the 'bbf' namespace

   Relevant ancillary documentation:

      BBF publishes information regarding the registered resources on
      the BBF Assigned Resources web page [BBF-RESOURCES].

Internet-Draft     URN Namespaces for Broadband Forum      November 2016


   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

      BBF will manage resource classes using the "bbf" NID and will be
      the authority for managing resources and associated subsequent
      strings.  BBF is expected to guarantee the uniqueness of the
      strings themselves or it may permit secondary responsibility for
      certain defined resources.

      BBF may, at the namespace resource manager's discretion,
      designate/allocate experimental type values for testing purposes
      only.  Note that using experimental types may create collisions as
      multiple users may use the same values for resources and specific
      strings.

   Identifier persistence considerations:

      BBF will update the BBF Assigned Resources web page
      [BBF-RESOURCES] to document the registered resources that use the
      "bbf" NID.

   Process of identifier assignment:

      BBF procedures for URN assignment are provided at [BBF-RESOURCES].

   Process for identifier resolution:

      The namespace is not listed with a resolution discovery system;
      this is not applicable for this URN registration.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

      No special considerations; the rules for lexical equivalence of
      [RFC2141] apply.

   Conformance with URN Syntax:

      No special considerations.

   Validation mechanism:

      None specified.  URN assignment will be handled by procedures
      implemented in support of BBF activities.

   Scope:

      Global

5.  Example

   The following examples represent hypothetical URNs that could be
   assigned by BBF.

   urn:broadband-forum-org:cwmp:datamodel-1-5

   urn:bbf:yang:fast

   The first of these defines an URN to be used for CPE WAN Management
   Protocol (CWMP) data models conforming to rules for BBF's CWMP suite
   of specifications.

6.  Namespace Considerations

   BBF develops various specifications that require the use of data
   models.  URN Namespaces are key constructs to manage the definitions
   of those data models reliably with persistence and uniqueness.

   The use of URNs should also help specification authors to maintain
   different versions of URNs and dependencies between URNs, across
   different versions of BBF specifications, if they so wish.

   Three NIDs are defined.  The "broadband-forum-org" and "dslforum-org"
   (Broadband Forum changed its name from DSL Forum in 2008) NIDs have
   been used for many years by BBF without formal registration.  As they
   are referenced by multiple BBF specifications currently in common
   use, BBF is requesting to formalize them.  The new "bbf" NID will be
   used for new work efforts.

7.  Community Considerations

   Participants involved in the development and usage of Broadband Forum
   specifications will benefit from the publication of this namespace by
   providing consistent and reliable names for the XML namespaces,
   schema locations, and similar identifiers of physical data models
   published within BBF specifications.

   The BBF specifications are publicly available and are licensed to
   manufacturers on a reasonable and nondiscriminatory basis.  BBF will
   maintain the allocation of resources for the "bbf", "broadband-forum-
   org", and "dslforum-org" NIDs at the following publicly-viewable
   location: [BBF-RESOURCES].  BBF will also maintain the corresponding
   specifications where the registered resources are referenced or used.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document adds three new entries in the formal urn-namespaces
   registry.  The namespaces should be "bbf", "broadband-forum-org", and
   "dslforum-org".  This is the defining document.  The entries can be
   found at: http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces and any
   associated mirrors.

9.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations other than those
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.
