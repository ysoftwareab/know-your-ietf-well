   components:

   o    An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

   o    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events
        for the purpose of management.  The first version of this
        Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1
        and described in STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16,
        RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 1215 [RFC1215]. The second
        version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578
        [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58,
        RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

   o    Message protocols for transferring management information.
        The first version of the SNMP message protocol is called
        SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A
        second version of the SNMP message protocol, which is not
        an Internet standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c
        and described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].
        The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3
        and described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572]
        and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

   o    Protocol operations for accessing management information.
        The first set of protocol operations and associated PDU
        formats is described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A
        second set of protocol operations and associated PDU
        formats is described in RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

   o    A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
        [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism
        described in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the

   MIB.

3.0 Overview

   The objects defined in this MIB are to be used when describing Layer
   Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) tunnels. The L2TP protocol is defined
   in [RFC2661]. This MIB consists of seven groups briefly described
   below:

   l2tpConfigGroup
   l2tpStatsGroup
      These two groups of objects provide information on the
      configuration, state and statistics of the L2TP protocol, its
      tunnels and sessions.  These groups are mandatory for implementors
      of this MIB.

   l2tpDomainGroup
      This optional group of objects provides configuration, state and
      statistical information for L2TP tunnel endpoint domains. A L2TP
      tunnel endpoint domain is considered to be a  collection of L2TP
      devices typically belonging to a common administrative domain or
      geographic location.

   l2tpMappingGroup
      This optional group contains mapping tables to assist management
      applications to map between protocol identifiers and table
      indices.

   l2tpIpUdpGroup
      This group provides the state and statistics information for L2TP
      tunnels which are being transported by UDP/IP. This group is
      mandatory for L2TP implementations that support L2TP over UDP/IP.

   l2tpSecurityGroup
      This group is optional for SNMP agents which support both
      authentication and privacy of SNMP messages for the management of
      L2TP keys.

   l2tpTrapGroup
      This group contains the notifications that could be generated by a
      L2TP implementation.

   l2tpHCPacketGroup
      This group is optional for L2TP implementations that could
      potentially overflow the L2TP Domain tables 32-bit statistics
      counters in less than an hour.

3.1 Relationship to the Interface MIB

   This section clarifies the relationship of this MIB to the Interfaces
   MIB [RFC2863]. Several areas of correlation are addressed in the
   following subsections.  The implementor is referred to the Interfaces
   MIB document in order to understand the general intent of these
   areas.


3.1.1  Layering Model

   This MIB contains several tables which are extensions to the IP
   Tunnel MIB described in [RFC2667] which itself defines extensions to
   the Interface MIB [RFC2863]. An L2TP tunnel is represented as a
   separate identifiable logical interface sub-layer. The tunnel stack
   layering model is described in [RFC2667].

   In addition to that described in [RFC2667] an L2TP tunnel will not be
   at the top of the ifStack on a L2TP device that is acting as a L2TP
   Network Server (LNS). In this case PPP interfaces will be layered on
   top of the tunnel interface.

   In the example diagram below, the interface layering is shown as it
   might appear at the LNS.

   L2TP Access Concentrator (LAC) tunnel interfaces on the other hand
   appear at the top of the interface layering stack.  In this case the
   layering model is as described in [RFC2667].

   However in order to support the tunneling of packets received from
   interfaces carrying framed PPP packets on the LAC to the LNS (and the
   propagation of decapsulated PPP packets to that interface) additional
   configuration is required. This is further described in section 3.4.


3.1.2  Interface MIB Objects

   Except where noted in the tables below, all objects MUST be supported
   from the ifGeneralInformationGroup and one of the following three groups:

      o ifHCPacketGroup OR
      o ifVHCPacketGroup

   depending on the particular implementation.

   The following tables describe how objects from the ifGeneralInformationGroup
   and ifPacketGroup (similar support should be provided for the high and very
   high capacity packet groups) are to be interpreted and supported for L2TP
   tunnel interfaces.


3.1.2.1  L2TP Tunnel Interfaces

   All Interface MIB objects not listed in the above groups for L2TP tunnel
   interfaces MUST be supported as described in [RFC2863].

                              be 65467 (65535-60(IP)-8(UDP))

      ifTable.ifSpeed         Return zero.

      ifTable.ifPhyAddress    The assigned tunnel identifier.

      ifTable.ifAdminStatus   Setting ifAdminStatus to 'up' injects a
                              'Local Open' request into the tunnel FSM.
                              Setting ifAdminStatus to 'down' injects
                              a 'Tunnel Close' event into the tunnel
                              FSM. Setting ifAdminStatus to 'testing'
                              is not currently defined but could be
                              used to test tunnel connectivity.

      ifTable.ifOperStatus    ifOperStatus values are to be interpreted
                              as follows:
                                    'up' - tunnel is established
                                    'down' - administratively down
                                             or peer unreachable.
                                    'testing' - in some test mode.
                                    'unknown' - status cannot be determined
                                             for some reason.
                                    'dormant' - operational but waiting

3.2  Relationship to other MIBs

3.2.1  Relationship to the IP Tunnel MIB

   The IP Tunnel MIB [RFC2667] describes tunnel interfaces that have an ifType
   of tunnel(131). The IP Tunnel MIB is considered to contain a collection of
   objects common to all IP tunneling protocols, including L2TP. In addition
   to the IP Tunnel MIB, tunnel encapsulation specific MIBs (like this MIB)
   extend the IP Tunnel MIB to further describe encapsulation specific
   information. Implementation of the IP Tunnel MIB is required for L2TP
   tunnels over IP.


3.3  L2TP Tunnel Creation

   Tunnel creation is detailed for tunnels over IP in the IP Tunnel MIB.
   The creation of a tunnelIfEntry in [RFC2667] when the encapsulation
   method is "l2tp" will have the side effect of creating entries in the
   l2tpTunnelConfigTable, l2tpTunnelStatsTable and the l2tpUdpStatsTable's.

   The creation of L2TP tunnel interfaces over transports other than IP
   is expected to be defined in the MIB definition for that specific
   L2TP tunnel transport.


3.4  L2TP Session Mapping

   The l2tpSessionMapTable table allows management applications to
   determine which session within a tunnel a particular interface
   (either a PPP or DS0 interface) is mapped to. On the LAC it
   also provides a management application the ability to map a
   particular physical or virtual interface terminating a PPP link
   to a particular L2TP tunnel. This is required since the interface
   stacking as performed (and instrumented by the ifStackTable) on
   the LNS cannot be applied at the LAC.

   The following diagram illustrates the conceptual binding that
   occurs.

             |       L2TP Session Map Database       |
             +----------+-----------------+----------+

                    +-------+       +------------+

   The stacking of the individual interface stacks would be
   described by the ifStackTable.

5.0 Security Considerations

   This MIB contains readable objects whose values provide information
   related to L2TP tunnel interfaces.  There are also a number of objects
   that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create, such as
   those which allow an administrator to dynamically configure tunnels.

   While unauthorized access to the readable objects is relatively
   innocuous, unauthorized access to the write-able objects could cause a
   denial of service, or could cause unauthorized creation and/or
   manipulation of tunnels. Hence, the support for SET operations in a
   non-secure environment without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.

   SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec [RFC2401]), even then, there
   is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and SET
   (change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   If the agent allows configuring keys (for example the l2tpDomainConfigSecret
   object) via SNMP, for use by L2TP, then the security of L2TP is at best
   only as secure as SNMP. For this reason, security-related objects MUST
   NOT be accessible via unencrypted messages. It is also recommended that
   keys not be made visible through SNMP GET (or GET-NEXT or GET-BULK)
   messages, even if encryption is used.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features
   as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of the
   User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-based Access
   Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity
   giving access to this MIB, is properly configured to give access to
   those objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to access them.

6.0 Acknowledgements
