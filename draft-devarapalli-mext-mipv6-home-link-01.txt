Abstract

   The Mobile IPv6 protocol is being adopted by various Standards
   Development Organizations (SDO) for mobility across wide area
   networks.  Some of the architectures developed by these SDOs require
   some of the access links to be home link for mobile node.  The belief
   is that if the mobile node thinks it is attached to the home link,
   there will not be additional packet overhead due to Mobile IPv6
   tunneling.  Many of these links where the mobile node is supposed to

   be attached to the home link are point-to-point links.  There are
   some issues with making these point-to-point links appear like home
   link to the mobile node.  This document captures some of the issues
   related to this, and analyzes possible solutions.

Internet-Draft          MIPv6 Home Link Operation          February 2008


1.  Introduction

   The Mobile IPv6 protocol [2] is being adopted by various Standards
   Development Organizations (SDOs) for mobility across wide area
   cellular networks.  The architectures being developed by the SDOs
   involve some access links where bandwidth is considered scarce.
   Therefore, the SDOs have designed the architectures so that the
   Mobile IPv6 signaling and tunneling overhead can be avoided over
   these access links.  For various reasons, Route Optimization is not
   being considered by the SDOs.

   According to RFC 3775 [2], the mobile node does not have a valid
   binding cache entry at the home agent and a Mobile IPv6 tunnel with
   the home agent only when it is attached to the home link.  Therefore
   the architectures being developed by the SDOs require of the access
   links to appear to the mobile node as home link so that the Mobile
   IPv6 overhead can be avoided.

   The access links where the mobile node is attached to the home link
   is of various types.  They typically tend to be point-to-point links.
   The following describes examples of point-to-point links where Mobile
   IPv6 home link operation is desired.

   o  GTP tunnels/PDP Contexts - GTP tunnels [4] between network
      entities or PDP contexts between the mobile node and a network
      entity are used as single hop point-to-point links between the
      mobile node and the home agent.  The architectures in [5] and [6]
      show scenarios where the home agent is co-located with a network
      entity that terminates the GTP tunnels.  In these cases, the
      mobile node, whenever it attaches over these access links is
      attached to the home link.  Note that this document uses the terms
      GTP and PDP context very loosely.  For more details about GTP
      tunnels or PDP contexts, please see [4].

   o  PMIPv6 tunnels - [5] shows an architecture where the Proxy Mobile
      IPv6 Local Mobility Anchor functionality [7] and Mobile IPv6 home
      agent functionality are co-located.  In this architecture whenever
      the mobile node is attached to the access link where PMIPv6 is
      used, it appears to the mobile node as if it is attached to the
      home link.  In this case, the concatenation of PMIPv6 tunnel
      between the Mobile Access Gateway and the Local Mobility Anchor
      and the point-to-point link between the mobile node and the mobile
      access gateway is used as the point-to-point link between the
      mobile node and the home agent.

   o  IPsec tunnels - [6] describes a scenario where a network entities
      that terminates IPsec tunnels from the mobile node is co-located
      with Mobile IPv6 home agent function.  In this case, whenever the

      mobile node is attached over IPsec tunnels, it appears to the
      mobile node as if it is attached to the home link.  In this case,
      an IPsec tunnel is used as point-to-point link between the mobile
      node and the home agent.

   In some of the scenarios in [5], it is possible to use concatenated
   GTP and PMIPv6 tunnel or concatenated IPsec tunnel and PMIPv6 tunnel
   as point-to-point links between the mobile node and the home agent.
   There are also scenarios where two concatenated PMIPv6 tunnels are
   used to provide a home link for the mobile node.

   There are some issues with using point-to-point links based on GTP/
   PMIPv6/IPsec tunnels between the mobile node and the home agent.
   This document discusses some of the issues and analyzes possible
   solutions.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].


3.  Issues with using Point-to-Point links as Home Links

   The following describes some of the issues with using point-to-point
   links as home links.

3.1.  Detecting Attachment to the Home Link

   In Mobile IPv6, a mobile node detects that it has attached to the
   home link when it receives a router advertisement with the home
   prefix.  Some of the point-to-point links like IPsec tunnels and
   PMIPv6 tunnels do not support running neighbor discovery in the
   tunnels.  When the home link is created by concatenating a GTP tunnel
   with a PMIPv6 tunnel or an IPsec tunnel with PMIPv6 tunnels, it
   becomes difficult for a router advertisement to be sent over the
   concatenated tunnels.

   If the mobile node is not able to use router discovery to detect
   attaching to the home link, then the only possible solution would be
   to configure the mobile node with the information on which links it
   needs to treat as home links.  This solution is not sufficient in
   most cases.

Internet-Draft          MIPv6 Home Link Operation          February 2008


3.2.  Bootstrapping

   Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping [8] and [9] depends on the use of IKEv2
   between the mobile node and the home agent to bootstrap the MIPv6
   home address.  According to RFC 3775, when the mobile node is
   attached to the home link, it does not have to run IKEv1/IKEv2 with
   the home agent to setup the necessary security associations.  Most
   often, the IKEv2 exchange is triggered by the need to send a binding
   update.  So if the mobile node boots up the home link, it may not be
   able to use IKEv2 to bootstrap the MIPv6 home address.

   The IKEv2 exchange is only used to bootstrap the MIPv6 home address.
   The DS-MIPv6 [11] IPv4 home address is obtained by the mobile node
   using the exchange of Binding Update and Binding Acknowledgement with
   the home agent.  The Mobile Network Prefixes required for mobile
   router operation, as described in [10], may also obtained using the
   Binding Update and Binding Acknowledgement exchange between the
   mobile router and the home agent.  This is specified in [12].
   According to the current specifications, the mobile node (or the
   mobile router) does not send a Binding Update to the home agent when
   it is attached to the home link.

   Since it is not typical for the mobile node to initiate an IKEv2
   exchange with its home agent and not possible to send a Binding
   Update from the home link, there is a need for other bootstrapping
   mechanisms that would work across all point-to-point home links.
   However, this would result in the mobile node using different
   bootstrapping mechanisms depending on the point-to-point that appears
   as the home link.  The mobile node would also end with using
   different bootstrapping mechanisms when attached to the home link and
   when attached to the visited link.  To avoid this, it would be
   desirable to use the same bootstrapping mechanisms irrespective of
   the point-to-point link that appears as the home link and/or the
   visited link.

3.3.  Home Address Management on the Mobile Node

   When the mobile node boots up on the home link, it will configure the
   IPv6 home address (and the IPv4 home address).  The home address(es)
   are configured using address configuration mechanisms specific to the
   point-to-point links.  The mobile node then assigns the address(es)
   to the interface that corresponds to the point-to-point link.  The
   Mobile IPv6 stack that is running on the mobile node needs to know
   that the addresses now assigned to the point-to-point links are also
   the home addresses and should be assigned to the Mobile IPv6 virtual
   interface when the mobile node moves away from the home and attaches
   to a visited link.

Internet-Draft          MIPv6 Home Link Operation          February 2008


3.4.  Forwarding at the Home Agent

   According to RFC 3775, when the mobile node is attached to the home
   link, it behaves as a regular IPv6 host and is able to send/receive
   packets directly without going through the home agent.  In case the
   home agent needs to send any packet to the mobile node, it has a
   valid neighbor cache entry for the mobile node which is then used to
   forward packets to the mobile node.

   When point-to-point links are used a home links, then the packets
   meant for the mobile node always reach the home agent first and are
   then forwarded to the mobile node.  However, the home agent cannot
   construct a neighbor cache entry for the mobile node, since most of
   the point-to-point links mentioned in Section 1 do not support
   sending neighbor solicitation and receiving neighbor advertisement
   messages.  The home agent would need to associate the mobile node's
   home address with the point-to-point link between the mobile node and
   the home agent.  This would require tighter integration between the
   function that terminates the point-to-point link and the home agent
   function on the same network node.

   In some of the configurations described in [5] and [6], it may be
   possible that two different access links for a mobile node appear as
   a home link.  When the mobile node performs a handover between these
   two interfaces, it would appear to it, that it attached to the same
   home link using another interface.  For this scenario to work, the
   home agent would need to know that the mobile node, after a handover,
   is reachable at home over a different point-to-point link.  This
   would again require tighter integration between the functions that
   terminate the two different types of point-to-point link and the home
   agent function.

3.5.  Indicating Service Selection Option

   A new extension, the Service Selection for Mobile IPv6, has been
   specified in [13] for the mobile node to indicate to the home agent
   which service it wants to access.  The Service Selection option is
   sent in the Binding Update.  When the mobile node boots up in the
   home link, it won't be able to indicate the service it wants to
   access to the home agent, since the Binding Update message is not
   sent from the home link.

   It is possible to indicate the Service the mobile node wants to
   access in the IKEv2 exchange with the home agent.  The service
   information is encoded in the IDr payload in the IKEv2 exchange.
   However, this requires the mobile node to initiate an IKEv2 exchange
   with the mobile node from the home link.  According to RFC 3775, the
   mobile node does not have to initiate an IKEv2 exchange when it boots

   up in the home link.


4.  Solution Analysis

   A straight forward solution to avoid the issues described in
   Section 3 is to avoid the home link operation.  The mobile node is
   always attached to the visited link.  The home link becomes a virtual
   home link in this case.  However, this solution may not be acceptable
   due to resource constraints on some of the point-to-point links
   mentioned in Section 1.

   A possible solution would be for the mobile node to perform an IKEv2
   exchange and a Binding Update/Binding Acknowledgement exchange with
   the home agent even when it is attached to the home link.  A new flag
   'C' is used in the Binding Update and Binding Acknowledgement
   messages to indicate that these messages are being sent on the home
   link and are used only for bootstrapping and configuring other
   information.  The Home Agent does not create a binding cache entry
   when it processes the Binding Update with the 'C' flag set.  This
   extension to Mobile IPv6, should only be used by those mobile nodes
   which boot up on the home link using point-to-point links.  The use
   of the extensions specified in the section should be configurable on
   the mobile node and the home agent.

   A regular Binding Update, as defined in [2], cannot be used for
   bootstrapping and obtaining configuration information when the mobile
   node is on the home link.  When the home agent receives a Binding
   Update from a mobile node on the home link, it is treated as a de-
   registration Binding Update.  When the home agent receives the de-
   registration Binding Update from the mobile node and it does not have
   a valid binding cache entry for the mobile node, it responds with the
   failed status 133 (Not home agent for this mobile node) in the
   Binding Acknowledgement [2].  The DS-MIPv6 IPv4 home address and
   Mobile Network prefixes will not be sent in the Binding
   Acknowledgement, since the Binding Update is seen as a failed one.
   This is one of the reasons why a new flag (the 'C' flag) is necessary
   in the Binding Update.

   Whenever the mobile node boots up on a point-to-point link, it first
   configures information, including the IP address, specific to the
   point-to-point link.  The mobile node then initiates an IKEv2
   exchange with the home agent as described in [3].  If the home agent
   detects that the mobile node is sending IKEv2 messages from a point-
   to-point link shared with the mobile node, it obtains the IPv6
   address assigned to the mobile node for the point-to-point link, and
   sends the same address in the INTERNAL_IP6_ADDRESS attribute in the
   IKE_AUTH response message [3].  This indicates to the mobile node



Devarapalli, et al.      Expires August 27, 2008                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          MIPv6 Home Link Operation          February 2008


   that the address it obtained earlier as part of point-to-point access
   link setup, is now usable as the IPv6 home address also.  The IKEv2
   exchange also sets up the necessary security associations for
   protecting the Binding Update and Binding Acknowledgement messages.

   Once the IKEv2 exchange is complete, the mobile node sends a Binding
   Update with the 'C' flag set to the home agent.  The 'C' flag
   indicates that this Binding Update is only being sent for
   bootstrapping and not to create a binding cache entry.  The bootstrap
   information may include requests for the DS-MIPv6 IPv4 home address
   [11], and the NEMO Mobile Network Prefixes [12].  The mobile node may
   also indicate the service it wants to access using the service
   selection option [13].  The Binding Update includes the home address
   that the mobile node obtained earlier as part of the IKEv2 exchange.

   When the home agent processes the Binding Update with the 'C' flag
   set, it MUST treat the message as a Binding Update sent from the home
   link.  The home agent does not create a binding cache entry for the
   mobile node.  The home agent associates the point-to-point link over
   which the Binding Update was received with the home address of the
   mobile node.  This is used to create a forwarding entry on the home
   agent to forward packets meant for the mobile node's home address to
   the point-to-point link shared with the mobile node.  Once the
   Binding Update processing is successful, the home agent responds with
   a Binding Acknowledgement to the mobile node.  In the Binding
   Acknowledgement, the home agent indicates that it is sent from the
   home link, by setting the 'C' bit.  The home agent also includes
   information like the IPv4 home address and the NEMO Mobile Network
   Prefixes in the Binding Acknowledgement if the mobile node had
   requested the same.  If the IPv4 home address was sent by the home
   agent, another forwarding entry is created to forward packets meant
   for the IPv4 home address to the point-to-point link over which the
   Binding Update was received.

   When the mobile node receives a Binding Acknowledgement with the 'C'
   flag set, it treats this message as a confirmation that it is
   attached to the home link.  The mobile node configures the IPv4 home
   address as the DS-MIPv6 IPv4 home address.  The mobile node obtains
   other bootstrapping information it had requested for in the Binding
   Update.

   When the mobile node moves away its home link and attaches to the
   visited link, it sends regular Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates to the
   home agent.
