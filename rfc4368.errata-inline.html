1.  Introduction

   This memo defines how label-switching-controlled Frame-Relay
   [RFC3034] and ATM [RFC3035] interfaces can be realized given the
   interface stacking as defined in the MPLS-LSR-STD [RFC3813] and
   MPLS-TE-STD [RFC3812] MIBs.  This document also contains a MIB module
   that sparsely extends the MPLS-LSR-STD MIB&#x27;s mplsInterfaceConfTable
   in such a way as to identify which MPLS-type interfaces have LC-ATM
   or LC-FR capabilities.  Comments should be made directly to the MPLS
   mailing list at mpls@uu.net.

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;,  &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119, reference
   [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology from the document describing the MPLS
   architecture [RFC3031], as well as from RFC 3035 and RFC 3034.
   Specifically, the following terms will be used in this document.

   <span class="Verified-inline-styling" id='inline-105'>   LC-FR <button id="btn_105" target="expand_105" onclick='hideFunction("expand_105")'>Expand</button>
         RFC 3034 defines a label-switching-controlled Frame Relay
         (LC-FR) interface.  Packets traversing such an interface carry
         labels in the DLCI field

   LC-ATM
         RFC 3035 defines a label-switching-controlled ATM (LC-ATM)
         interface as an ATM interface controlled by the label switching
         control component. </span id__locate=105>  When a packet traversing such an interface

<b><i><a href='https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid105'>EID 105</a> (Verified) is as follows:</i></b>

<b>Section:</b> 2

<b>Original Text:</b>

   C-FR  RFC 3034 defines a label-switching-controlled Frame Relay
         (LC-FR) interface.  Packets traversing such an interface carry
         labels in the DLCI field

   C-ATM RFC 3035 defines a label-switching-controlled ATM (LC-ATM)
         interface as an ATM interface controlled by the label switching
         control component.

         (LC-FR) interface.  Packets traversing such an interface carry

</div>         is received, it is treated as a labeled packet.  The packet&#x27;s
         top label is inferred from either the contents of the Virtual
         Channel Identifier (VCI) field or the combined contents of the
         Virtual Path Identifier (VPI) and VCI fields.  Any two LDP
         peers that are connected via an LC-ATM interface will use LDP
         negotiations to determine which of these cases is applicable to
         that interface.  Static configuration of labels is also
         possible.

   When LDP is used to distribute labels for use on label-controlled
   interfaces, label configuration information may be available in the
   MPLS-LDP-ATM-STD-MIB [RFC3815] when LC-ATM interfaces are used, or
   the MPLS-LDP-FRAME-RELAY-STD-MIB [RFC3815] when LC-FR interfaces are
   used.

3.  The SNMP Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

4.  Interface Stacking of LC-ATM

   Since LC-ATM interfaces [RFC2863] can carry labeled MPLS traffic,
   they too are considered MPLS subinterfaces with ifType = mpls(166).
   They differ slightly in their capability from a packet-oriented MPLS
   interface in that they may carry ATM- or Frame-Relay-encapsulated
   traffic.  It is thus beneficial to identify them as such.  To do
   this, two tables are defined that extend the MPLS-LSR-STD MIB&#x27;s
   mplsInterfaceTable (see section 5 for LC-ATM or section 6 for LC-FR).

5.  Structure of the MPLS-LC-ATM-STD-MIB Module

   The MPLS-LC-ATM-STD-MIB module is structured simply as a table of
   entries that sparsely extend those found in the interfaces table.  In
   particular, the entries in the mplsLcAtmStdInterfaceConfTable extend
   interfaces capable of supporting MPLS, as is defined in [RFC3813], to
   include entries that also support LC-ATM (and their unique
   attributes).  Therefore, the module can be visualized as follows.
   Note that the ifTable comes from [RFC2863], the mplsInterfaceTable
   from [RFC3813], and the mplsLcAtmStdInterfaceConfTable from the
   MPLS-LC-ATM-STD-MIB module described below.

   ifTable mplsInterfaceTable mplsLcAtmStdInterfaceConfTable
   .1
   .2       .2
   .3
   .4       .4                .4
   .5

   In the example shown above, five interfaces exist on the device in
   question.  Of those interfaces, those with ifIndex = .2 and .4 are of
   ifType = mpls(166) indicating that they are capable of MPLS.  Of
   those two, the entry with index .4 is capable of MPLS LC-ATM
   operations.

   Note that the label partition model utilized by the authors of this
   document reflects widespread implementation and is seen by the MPLS
   working group as sufficiently flexible to meet the operational needs,
   even if it is more restrictive than [RFC3035] allows.  To this end,
   we have limited the control and unlabeled VPI and VCI to single
   values<span class="Verified-inline-styling" id='inline-675'>  Note that the VPI/VCI pair used for unlabeled traffic <button id="btn_675" target="expand_675" onclick='hideFunction("expand_675")'>Expand</button>
  (mplsLcAtmStdUnlabTrafVpi, mplsLcAtmStdUnlabTrafVci) MUST NOT equal
  the VPI/VIC pair used for control traffic (mplsLcAtmStdCtrlVpi,
  mplsLcAtmStdCtrlVci).</span id__locate=675>
<div class="nodeCloseClass" id='expand_675'><div class='Verified-endnote-styling' id='eid675'>
<pre>
<b><i><a href='https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid675'>EID 675</a> (Verified) is as follows:</i></b>

<b>Section:</b> 5

<b>Original Text:</b>

    [...].  Note that mplsLcAtmStdUnlabTrafVci and mplsLcAtmStdCtrlVci
   MUST not be equal; nor should mplsLcAtmStdCtrlVpi or
   mplsLcAtmStdUnlabTrafVpi be equal.

<b>Corrected Text:</b>

  Note that the VPI/VCI pair used for unlabeled traffic 
  (mplsLcAtmStdUnlabTrafVpi, mplsLcAtmStdUnlabTrafVci) MUST NOT equal
  the VPI/VIC pair used for control traffic (mplsLcAtmStdCtrlVpi,
  mplsLcAtmStdCtrlVci).
</pre>
<b>Notes:</b><br/>
The  (Vpi, Vci) - *pairs*  must not be equal for every<br/>mplsLcAtmStdInterfaceConfEntry.
</div>
</div>
6.  Structure of the MPLS-LC-FR-STD-MIB Module

   The MPLS-LC-FR-STD-MIB module is structured simply as a table of
   entries that sparsely extend those found in the interfaces table.  In
   particular, the entries in the mplsLcFrStdInterfaceConfTable extend
   interfaces capable of supporting MPLS, as is defined in [RFC3813], to
   include entries that also support LC-Frame Relay (and their unique
   attributes).  Therefore, the module can be visualized as follows.
   Note that the ifTable comes from [RFC2863], the mplsInterfaceTable
   from [RFC3813], and the mplsLcAtmStdInterfaceConfTable from the
   MPLS-LC-FR-STD-MIB module described below.

   ifTable mplsInterfaceTable mplsLcFrStdInterfaceConfTable
   .1
   .2      .2
   .3
   .4      .4                 .4
   .5

   In the example shown above, five interfaces exist on the device in
   question.  Of those interfaces, those with ifIndex = .2 and .4 are of
   ifType = mpls(166) indicating that they are capable of MPLS.  Of
   those two, the entry with index .4 is capable of MPLS LC-Frame Relay
   operations.

   Note that even though the architecture as described in [RFC3034]
   calls for supporting mixed labeled and unlabeled traffic, this MIB
   does not support that, as this capability does not seem to be used
   operationally.  Note that the DLCI ranges represented by
   mplsLcFrStdTrafficMinDlci to mplsLcFrStdTrafficMaxDlci and
   mplsLcFrStdCtrlMinDlci to mplsLcFrStdCtrlMaxDlci MUST not overlap.

10.  Security Considerations

   It is clear that these MIB modules are potentially useful for
   monitoring MPLS LSRs supporting LC-ATM and/or LC-FR.  These MIBs can
   also be used for configuration of certain objects, and anything that
   can be configured can be incorrectly configured, with potentially
   disastrous results.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o    the MplsLcAtmStdInterfaceConfTable and
        mplsLcFrStdInterfaceConfTable collectively contain objects that
        may be used to provision MPLS LC or FR-enabled interfaces.
        Unauthorized access to objects in these tables could result in
        disruption of traffic on the network.  This is especially true
        if traffic has been established over these interfaces.  The use
        of stronger mechanisms such as SNMPv3 security should be
        considered where possible.  Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and USM
        MUST be used with any v3 agent that implements this MIB module.
        Administrators should consider whether read access to these
        objects should be allowed, since read access may be undesirable
        under certain circumstances.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o    the MplsLcAtmStdInterfaceConfTable and
        mplsLcFrStdInterfaceConfTable collectively show the LC-ATM
        and/or LC-FR interfaces, their associated configurations, and
        their linkages to other MPLS-related configuration and/or
        performance statistics.  Administrators not wishing to reveal

        this information should consider these objects
        sensitive/vulnerable and take precautions so they are not
        revealed.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

11.  IANA Considerations

   As described in and as requested in the MPLS-TC-STD-MIB [RFC3811],
   MPLS-related standards track MIB modules should be rooted under the
   mplsStdMIB subtree.  There are 2 MPLS MIB modules contained in this
   document; each of the following &quot;IANA Considerations&quot; subsections
   requested from IANA a new assignment under the mplsStdMIB subtree.
   New assignments can only be made via a Standards Action as specified
   in [RFC2434].

11.1.  IANA Considerations for MPLS-LC-ATM-STD-MIB

   The IANA has assigned { mplsStdMIB 9 } to the MPLS-LC-ATM-STD-MIB
   module specified in this document.

11.2.  IANA Considerations for MPLS-LC-FR-STD-MIB

   The IANA has assigned { mplsStdMIB 10 } to the MPLS-LC-FR-STD-MIB
   module specified in this document.
