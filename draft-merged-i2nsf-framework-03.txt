Abstract

   This document serves as the framework for detailed work items for
   I2NSF. In the design of interfaces to allow for the provisioning of
   network security functions (NSFs), a critical consideration is to
   prevent the creation of implied constraints.

   This document makes the recommendation that such interfaces be
   designed from the paradigm of processing packets and flows on the
   network. NSFs ultimately are packet-processing engines that inspect
   packets traversing networks, either directly or in context to
   sessions to which the packet is associated.

1. Introduction

   This document describes the framework for Interface to Network
   Security Functions (I2NSF) and defines a reference model along with
   functional components for I2NSF. It also describes how I2NSF
   facilitates Software-defined network (SDN) and Network Function
   Virtualization (NVF) control, while avoiding potential constraints
   which could limit NSFs internal functions.

   The I2NSF use cases ([I2NSF-ACCESS], [I2NSF-DC] and [I2NSF-Mobile])
   call for standard interfaces for clients, e.g. applications,
   application controllers, or users, to inform network what they are
   willing to receive, when and how their specific data should be
   delivered. And provide the standard interface for them to monitor
   the security functions hosted and managed by service providers.

   [I2NSF-Problem] describes the motivation and the problem space for
   Interface to Network Security Functions.

3. Interfaces to Flow-based NSFs

   The emergence of SDN and NFV has resulted in the need to create
   application programming interfaces (APIs) in support of dynamic
   requests from various applications or application controllers. Flow-
   based NSFs [I2NSF-Problem] inspect and treat packets in the order as
   they are received.

   The Interface to Flow-based NSFs can be generally grouped into three
   types:

   1) Configuration - deals with the management and configuration of
   the NSF device itself, such as port, supported protocols, and/or
   addresses configurations. Configuration deals with attributes that
   are don't change very much.




xxx, et al.             Expires April 15, 2016                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft              I2NSF Framework                October 2015


   2) Signaling - which represents logging and query functions between
   the NSF and external systems. Signaling API functions may also be
   well defined by other protocols such as SYSLOG, DOTS, etc.

   3) Rules Provisioning - used to control the rules that govern how
   packets are treated by the NSFs. To enable  applications,
   application controllers or clients to dynamically control
   what/when/how traffic they want to receive, much of the I2NSF
   efforts towards interface development will be in this area.

   This draft proposes that a rule provisioning interface to NSFs can
   be developed on a packet-based paradigm. While there are many
   classifications of existing and emerging NSFs, a common trait shared
   by them is in the processing of packets based on the content
   (header/payload) and context (session state, authentication state,
   etc) of received packets.

   An important concept is the fact that attackers do not have
   standards as to how to attack networks, so it is equally important
   not to constrain NSF developers to offering a limited set of
   security functions. Therefore, in constructing standards for rules
   provisioning interfaces to NSFs, it is equally important to allow
   support for vendor-specific functions, to allow the introduction of
   NSFs that evolve to meet new threats. Proposed standards for rules
   provisioning interfaces to NSFs should not:

   - Narrowly define NSF categories, or their roles when implemented
   within a network

   - Attempt to impose functional requirements or constraints, either
   directly or indirectly, upon NSF developers

   - Be a limited lowest-common denominator approach, where interfaces
   can only support a limited set of standardized functions, without
   allowing for vendor-specific functions

   - Be seen as endorsing a best-common-practice for the implementation
   of NSFs

   By using a packet-based approach to the design of such provisioning
   interfaces, the goal is to create a workable interface to NSFs which

   aid in their integration within SDN/NFV environments, while avoiding
   potential constraints which could limit their functional
   capabilities.

   Even though security functions come in variety of form factors and
   have different features, provisioning to Flow-based NSFs can be
   categorized by

     - Subject - Match values based on packet data Packet header or
       Packet payload, which can be one or more header fields or bits
       in the packets, or the various combination of them;
     - Object - Match values based on context, e.g. State, direction of
       the traffic, time, geo-location, etc.,
     - Action- Egress processing, such as Invoke signaling; Packet
       forwarding and/or transformation; Possibility for SDN/NFV
       integration, and
     - Functional Profile - E.g. IPS:<Profile>, signature file, Anti-
       virus file, URL filtering file, etc. Integrated and one-pass
       checks on the content of packets.

   The functional profile or signature file is one of the key
   properties that determine the effectiveness of the NSF, and is
   mostly vendor specific today.

                         Figure 1: Multiple Interfaces




4.1. NSF Facing (Capability Layer) Interface

     This is the interface between the Service Provider's management
     system (or Security Controller) and the NSFs that are selected to
     enforce the desired network security. This interface is called
     Capability Interface in the I2NSF context.


4.2. Client Facing (Service Layer) Interface

     This interface is for clients or Application Controller to express
     and monitor security policies for their specific flows. The client
     facing interface is called Server Layer Interface in the I2NSF
     context. The I2NSF Service Layer also allows clients to monitor
     the client specific policies and execution status.

Internet-Draft              I2NSF Framework                October 2015


     A single client layer policy may need multiple NSFs or NSF
     instantiations collectively together to achieve the enforcement.


4.3. Vendor Facing Interface

     When service providers have multiple types of security functions
     provided by different vendors, it is necessary to have an
     interface for vendors to register their NSFs indicating their NSFs
     capabilities.

     The Registration Interface can be static or dynamic. When NSFs are
     upgraded, vendors need to notify the service provider management
     system or controller of the updated capabilities.


4.4. The network connecting the Security Controller and NSFs

     Most likely, the NSFs are not directly attached to the Security
     Controller; it is especially true when NSFs are distributed across
     the network. The network that connects the Security Controller
     with the NSFs can be the same network that carry the data traffic,
     or can be a dedicated network for management purpose only. Either
     case, packet loss could happen due to failure, congestion, or
     other reasons.

     Therefore, the transport mechanism used to carry the control
     messages and monitoring information should provide reliable
     message delivery.  Transport redundancy mechanisms such as
     Multipath TCP (MPTCP) [MPTCP] and the Stream Control Transmission
     Protocol (SCTP) [RFC3286] will need to be evaluated for
     applicability.  Latency requirements for control message delivery
     must also be evaluated.

     The connection between Security Controller and NSFs could be:

     - Closed environments where there is only one administrative
       domain.  More permissive access controls and lighter validation
       is needed inside the domain because of the protected
       environment.

Internet-Draft              I2NSF Framework                October 2015


     - Open environments where some NSFs (virtual or physical) can be
       hosted in external administrative domains or reached via
       external network domains.  Then more restrictive security
       controls are required over the I2NSF interface.  The information
       over the I2NSF interfaces must use trusted channels, such as
       TLS, SASL, or the combination of the two.

     Over the Open Environment, I2NSF needs to provide the identity
     frameworks and federations models for authentication and
     Authorization.



4.5. Interface to vNSFs

     Even though there is no difference between virtual network
     security functions (vNSF) and physical NSFs from policy
     provisioning perspective, there are some unique characteristics in
     interfacing to the vNSFs:

     - There could be multiple instantiations of one single NSF being
       distributed across network. When different instantiations are
       visible to the Security Controller, different policies may be
       applied to different instantiations of one single NSF.
     - When multiple instantiations of one single NSF appear as one
       single entity to the Security Controller, the policy
       provisioning has to be sent to the NSF's sub-controller, which
       in turn disseminate the polices to the corresponding
       instantiations of the NSF, as shown in the Figure 2 below.
     - Policies to one vNSF may need to be retrieved and move to
       another vNSF of the same type when client flows are moved from
       one vNSF to another.
     - Multiple vNSFs may share the same physical platform
     - There may be scenarios where multiple vNSFs collectively perform
       the security policies needed.

5. Flow-based NSF Capability Characterization

   There are many types of flow-based NSFs. Firewall, IPS, and IDS are
   the commonly deployed flow-based NSFs. However, the differences
   among them are definitely blurring somewhat as technological
   capacity increases, platforms are integrated, and the threat
   landscape shifts. At their core:
  . Firewall - A device or a function that analyzes packet headers and
     enforces policy based on protocol type, source address,
     destination address, source port, and/or destination port. Packets
     that do not match policy are rejected.
  . IDS (Intrusion Detection System) - A device or function that
     analyzes whole packets, both header and payload, looking for known
     events. When a known event is detected a log message is generated
     detailing the event.
  . IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) - A device or function that
     analyzes whole packets, both header and payload, looking for known
     events. When a known event is detected the packet is rejected.

   To prevent constraints on NSF vendors' creativity and innovation,
   this document recommends the Flow-based NSF interfaces to be
   designed from the paradigm of processing packets on the network.
   Flow-based NSFs ultimately are packet-processing engines that
   inspect packets traversing networks, either directly or in context
   to sessions to which the packet is associated.

   Flow-based NSFs differ in the depth of packet header or payload they
   can inspect, the various session/context states they can maintain,
   the specific profiles and the actions they can apply. An example of
   session is "allowing outbound connection requests and only allowing
   return traffic from the external network".

   Accordingly, the NSF capabilities are characterized by the level of
   packet processing and context that a NSF supports, the profiles and
   the actions that the NSF can apply. The term "context" includes
   session state, timer, and events.



   Vendors can register their NSFs using the Subject-Object-Action-
   Function categories described in Section 2, with detailed
   specification of each category as shown in the table below:


     +-----------------------------------------------------------+
     |         Subject Capability Index                          |
     +---------------+-------------------------------------------+
     | Layer 2       | Layer 2 header fields:                    |
     | Header        | Source/Destination/s-VID/c-VID/EtherType/.|

6. Structure of Rules to NSFs


6.1. Capability Layer Rules and Monitoring

   The Capability Layer is to express the explicit rules to individual
   NSFs on how to treat packets and methods to monitor the execution
   status of those functions.

   [ACL-MODEL] has defined rules for the Access Control List supported
   by most routers/switches that forward packets based on packets' L2,
   L3, or sometimes L4 headers. The actions for Access Control List
   include Pass, Drop, or Redirect.

   The functional profiles (or signatures) for NSFs are not present in
   [ACL-MODEL] because the functional profiles are unique to specific
   NSFs. Most vendors' IPS/IDS, and HoneyPot have their proprietary
   functions/profiles. One of the goals of I2NSF is to have common
   envelop format for exchanging or sharing profiles among different
   organizations to achieve more effective protection against threats.

   The "subject" of the I2NSF policies should not only include the
   matching criteria specified by [ACL-MODEL] but also the L4-L7 fields
   depending on the NSFs selected.

   The I2NSF Capability Layer has to specify the "Object" (i.e. the
   states/contexts surrounding the packets).

   The I2NSF "actions" should extend the actions specified by [ACL-
   MODEL] to include applying statistics functions that clients
   provide.

   The rules for Flow-Based NSF can be extended from the Policy Core
   Information Model [RFC3060] and Policy Core Information Model
   Extension [RFC3460] which are the bases for ITU-T X.1036 [ITU-T-
   X1036], as shown below:

   Capability layer also includes the policy monitoring of the
   individual NSFs and fault management of the policy execution. In NFV
   environment, policy consistency among multiple security function
   instances is very critical because security policies are no longer
   maintained by one central security devices, but instead are enforced
   by multiple security functions instantiated at various locations.

6.2. Service Layer Policy

   This layer is for clients, applications or Application Controllers
   to express & monitor the needed security policies for their specific
   flows.

   Some Customers may not have security skills. As such, they are not
   able to express requirements or security policies that are precise
   enough. Usually these customers are expressing expectations (that
   can be viewed as loose security requirements). Customers may also
   express guidelines such as which critical communications are to be
   preserved during critical events, which hosts are to service even
   during severe security attacks, etc. As the result, there could be
   many depths or layers of Service Layer policies. Here are some
   examples of more abstract service layer security Policies:

          o Pass for Subscriber "xxx" with Port "y"
          o enable basic parental control
          o enable "school protection control"
          o allow Internet traffic from 8:30 to 20:00 [time = 8:30-
            20:00]
          o scan email for malware detection [check type = malware]
            protect traffic to corporate network with integrity and
            confidentiality [protection type = integrity AND
            confidentiality]
          o remove tracking data from Facebook [website =
            *.facebook.com]
          o my son is allowed to access facebook from 18:30 to 20:00


   One Service Layer Security Policy may need multiple security
   functions at various locations to achieve the enforcement. Service
   layer Security Policy may need to be updated by users or Application
   Gateway when user's service requirements have been changed. [I2NSF-
   Demo] describes an implementation of translating a set of service
   layer policies to the Capability Layer instructions to NSFs.

   I2NSF will first focus on simple service layer policies that are
   modeled as closely as possible on the Capability Layer.  The I2NSF
   simple service layer should have similar structure as I2NSF
   capability layer, however with more client oriented expression for
   the subject, object, action, and function.

   There have been several industry initiatives to address network
   policies, such as IETF Policy Core Information Model-PCIM [RFC3060,
   RFC3460], OpenStack's Group-based Policy (GBP), and others. Since
   I2NSF is not to tackle the general network service policies, but
   instead I2NSF is to define a standard interface for
   clients/applications to inform the Flow-based NSFs on the rules for
   treating traffic traversing through, it is overkill to inherent the
   entire policy structures designed for various network services.

   However, the notion of Groups (or roles), Targets, Contexts (or
   conditions), and actions do cover what are needed for
   clients/applications to express the rules on how their flows to be
   treated by the Flow-Based NSFs in networks.  The goal is to have a
   policy structure that can be mapped to the Capability layer's
   Subject-Object-Action-Function" paradigm.

   I2NSF can use PCIM (RFC3060 which the ITU-T X.1036 was based on) as
   a starting point. However, RFC3060 was created for general network
   policies, in some aspects more than what I2NSF needs, and in other
   aspects needs extension. Especially need extension on the Policy
   Context or condition (i.e. the directions, the time, and other
   contextual events that govern the policies to NSFs).

   The I2NSF simple service layer can have the following entities:

       - Composite Groups or Roles (I2NSF-Role): This is a group of
          users, applications, virtual networks, or traffic patterns to
          which a service layer policy can be applied. An I2NSF-Role
          may be mapped to a client virtual Subnet (i.e. with private
          address prefix), a subnet with public address families,
          specific applications, destinations, or any combination of
          them with logical operators (Logical AND, OR, or NOT). An
          I2NSF-Role can have one or more Policy Rule Sets.
       - Target. This is used by the application client to establish
          communications over the network. A Target is mapped to a
          physical/logical ingress port, a set of destinations, or a
          physical/logical egress port.
       - Policy Rule Set. A Policy Rule Set is used to determine how
          the traffic between a pair of I2NSF-Role and Target is to be
          treated. A Policy Rule Set consists of one or more Policy
          Rules.
       - Policy Rule. A Policy Rule consists of a Policy Conditions
          and a set of Actions to be applied to the traffic.

       - Policy Condition. Describes when a Policy Rule set is to be
          applied. It can be expressed as a direction, a list of L4
          ports, time range, or a protocol, etc.
       - Policy Action: This is the action applied to the traffic that
          matches the Conditions. An action may be a simple ACL action
          (i.e. allow, deny, mirroring), applying a well known
          statistics functions (e.g. X minutes count, Y hours court),
          applying client specified functions (with URL provided), or
          may refer to an ordered sequence of functions.

7. Capability Negotiation

     When a NSF can't perform the desired provisioning due to resource
     constraint, it has to inform the controller.

     The protocol needed for this security function/capability
     negotiation may be somewhat correlated to the dynamic service
     parameter negotiation procedure [RFC7297]. The Connectivity
     Provisioning Profile (CPP) template documented in RFC7297, even
     though currently covering only Connectivity (but includes security
     clauses such as isolation requirements, non-via nodes, etc.),
     could be extended as a basis for the negotiation procedure.
     Likewise, the companion Connectivity Provisioning Negotiation
     Protocol (CPNP) could be a candidate to proceed with the
     negotiation procedure.

     The "security as a service" would be a typical example of the kind
     of (CPP-based) negotiation procedures that could take place
     between a corporate customer and a service provider. However, more
     security specific parameters have to be considered.



8. Types of I2NSF clients

   It is envisioned that I2NSF clients include:

   - Application Gateway:

        -                 For example, Video Conference Mgr/Controller needs to
          dynamically inform network to allow or deny flows (some of
          which are encrypted) based specific fields in the packets for
          a certain time span. Otherwise, some flows can't go through
          the NSFs (e.g. FW/IPS/IDS) in the network because the payload
          is encrypted or packets' protocol codes are not recognized by
          those NSFs.

   - Security Administrators

          - Enterprise

          - Operator Management System dynamically updates, monitors
            and verifies the security policies to NSFs (by different
            vendors) in a network.
          - Third party system


   - Security functions send requests for more sophisticated functions
     upon detecting something suspicious, usually via a security
     controller.



9. Manageability Considerations

     Management of NSFs usually includes
        -               life cycle management and resource management of vNSFs

        -               configuration of devices, such as address configuration,
          device internal attributes configuration, etc,

        -               signaling, and

        -               policy rules provisioning.

     I2NSF will only focus on the policy rule provisioning part, i.e.
     the last bullet listed above.

10. Security Considerations

     Having a secure access to control and monitor NSFs is crucial for
     hosted security service. Therefore, proper secure communication
     channels have to be carefully specified for carrying the
     controlling and monitoring information between the NSFs and their
     management entity (or entities).


11. IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA actions. RFC Editor: Please remove
