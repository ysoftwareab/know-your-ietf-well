               Scalable Network Slicing over SR Networks
                  draft-bestbar-spring-scalable-ns-01

Abstract

   Multiple network slices can be realized on top of a single shared
   network.  A router that requires forwarding of a packet that belongs
   to a slice aggregate may have to decide on the forwarding action to
   take based on selected next-hop(s), and the forwarding treatment
   (e.g., scheduling and drop policy) to enforce based on the slice
   aggregate per-hop behavior.  Segment Routing is a technology that
   enables the steering of packets in a network by encoding pre-
   established segments within the network into the packet header.  This
   document introduces mechanisms to enable forwarding of packets over a
   specific slice aggregate along a Segment Routing (SR) path.

1.  Introduction

   Network slicing allows a service provider, or a network operator to
   create independent and isolated logical networks on top of a common
   or shared physical network infrastructure.

   When logical network slices are realized on top of a shared physical
   network, it is important to forward traffic using only the specific
   resource(s) allocated to the network slice.

   The definition of a network slice for use within the IETF and the
   characteristics of IETF network slice are specified in
   [I-D.nsdt-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition].  A framework for
   reusing IETF VPN and traffic-engineering technologies to realize IETF
   network slices is discussed in [I-D.nsdt-teas-ns-framework].

   [I-D.bestbar-teas-ns-packet] introduces the notion of a Slice
   Aggregate as the construct that comprises of one of more IETF network
   slice traffic streams.  A slice policy can be used to realize a slice
   aggregate by instantiating specific control and data plane resources
   on select topological elements in an IP/MPLS network.  The packets
   belonging to a specific slice aggregate MAY require to be identified
   so that a specific forwarding treatment (e.g., scheduling and drop
   policy) is enforced.

   Segment Routing (SR) [RFC8402] specifies a mechanism to steer packets
   through a network by carrying an ordered list of segments.  A segment
   is referred to by its Segment Identifier (SID).

   This document introduces two approaches applicable to SR networks
   that enable forwarding of packet(s) that belong to a slice aggregate
   over a SR Path.

   The first approach extends the SR paradigm by defining a new SID type
   (slice SID) that, in addition to defining the forwarding action
   (next-hop selection), associates a SID to slice aggregate and allows
   enforcing the associated forwarding treatment.  The extensions to
   IGPs for slice aggregate SIDs are defined in
   [I-D.bestbar-lsr-spring-sa].

   The second approach relies on a separate field that is carried in the
   packet (e.g., MPLS label) to identify the slice aggregate and uses
   another field (e.g., existing SR segments) for the path selection for
   the packet.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Forwarding over SR Network Slices

   A router that receives a packet that belongs to a slice aggregate has
   to decide on the set of eligible next-hop(s) to forward the packet on
   (path selection), and on the forwarding treatment (scheduling and
   drop policy) that needs to be enforced for a specific slice aggregate
   (slice aggregate selection).

2.1.  Path Selection

   The segment routing architecture [RFC8402] defines a number of
   topological segments that may be advertised in routing protocols to
   allow for a flexible definition of end-to-end paths.  For example, an
   SR-capable IGP router may advertise SIDs for its attached prefixes
   and adjacencies.

   The IGP-Adjacency segment represents the strict path over a specific
   adjacency between two routers, while the IGP-Prefix segment
   represents the path to a prefix that is computed over a specific
   topology and algorithm.

   For an IGP-Prefix segment, the IGP uses the topology and algorithm to
   compute the primary, and optionally alternate (backup) next-hop(s)
   for a destination prefix.  SR allows the use of multiple routing
   algorithms (e.g., Flexible Algorithms) that enable IGPs on a router
   to compute paths for Prefix-SIDs whose topology may be constrained
   and whose paths optimized for additional metric types other than the
   default IGP cost (e.g., delay metric).

   Multiple slice aggregates may overlap over the same topology and
   require paths for prefixes to be optimized for the same Algorithm.
   In such case, the IGP selected path for the slice aggregate Prefix-
   SIDs can share the same IGP computed path (including the primary and
   backup next-hop(s)).  This enables the IGP to optimize the path
   computation and path programming for such SA Prefix-SIDs.

2.2.  Network Slice Selection

   The routers in network that forward traffic over links that are
   shared by multiple slice aggregates need to identify the slice
   aggregate that the packet belongs to in order to enforce the
   associated forwarding treatment on it.

   [I-D.bestbar-teas-ns-packet] introduces the slice policy as a means
   to realize a slice aggregate by instantiating specific control and/or
   data plane resources on select topological elements in the network.
   In order to enforce a forwarding treatment associated with a slice
   aggregate, the packets traversing a router MUST be identified as part
   of a slice aggregate (for example, by using field(s) carried in the
   packet).

2.2.1.  Segment Range as Slice Selector

   It is possible to derive the forwarding action (next-hop selection)
   and the per-hop forwarding treatment from a single field (e.g.  SR
   segment) carried inside a packet that is traversing the SR network.

Internet-Draft       Scalable Network Slices over SR       February 2021


   For example, one way to achieve this is leverage the SR Flexible-
   Algorithm [I-D.ietf-lsr-flex-algo] to assign SR SID per slice
   aggregate.  A router can can assign and advertise SR Prefix-SIDs per
   Flex-Algorithm for a prefix to enable reachability over multiple
   slice aggregates.

   For a specific Flexible Algorithm, the range of Prefix-SIDs of all
   prefixes in the network can be used as a slice selector mapping to a
   specific slice aggregate.  This approach does not require protocol
   extensions to be realized; however, it poses serious IGP scalability
   concerns when realizing a large number of slice aggregates.

   Alternatively, this document proposes to extend the IGP SR Prefix-SID
   and Adjacency-SID sub-TLVs defined in [RFC8667] and [RFC8665] to
   carry an additional distinguisher (Slice Aggregate identifier) to
   allow multiple SIDs to be assigned (and advertised) for the same
   topological element for the same Flexible-Algorithm and topology.  In
   such a case, a transit router can use the SR slice aggregate SID
   carried in the packet to identify the slice aggregate, as well as to
   determine the forwarding next-hop.

   Multiple Slice Aggregate Prefix-SIDs (SA Prefix-SIDs) can be assigned
   to the same prefix, while they share the same topology and Algorithm.
   The SA Prefix-SIDs can also share the same IGP computed paths
   (primary and backup).  Similarly, multiple Slice Aggregate Adjacency-
   SIDs (SA Adjacency-SIDs) can be allocated for the same adjacency
   between the two routers to distinguish forwarding over the same
   adjacency for each slice aggregate.  The extensions for IGPs to
   advertise SA Prefix-SIDs and SA Adjacency-SIDs are defined in
   [I-D.bestbar-lsr-spring-sa].

   The same forwarding treatment MUST be enforced on all packets
   belonging to a slice aggregate but destined to different topological
   elements in the network.  In this case, a range of SA (Prefix and
   Adjacency) SIDs is used to select the slice aggregate, and hence
   enforce the same forwarding treatment on them.

   Note that this approach requires maintaining per slice aggregate
   state for each topological element on every router in the network in
   both the control and data plane.  For example, a network composed of
   'N' routers, where each router has up to 'K' adjacencies to its
   neighbors, a router would have to assign and advertise 'M' SA Prefix-
   SIDs and 'M' SA Slice Adjacency-SID(s) to each of it 'K' adjacencies.
   Consequently, a router will have to maintain up to (N+K)*M SIDs in
   the control plane, and an equal number of labeled routes in its
   forwarding plane.

   Consider a network shown in Figure 1 that is enabled for SR.  The
   Segment Routing Global Block (SRGB) on all routers is assumed to
   start from 16000.  We assume the links in the network are partitioned
   amongst two network slice aggregates: SA1, and SA2.

   o  Node R5 assigns two Algorithm 0 SA Prefix-SIDs, index=105, and
      index=205 to represent the shortest IGP to R5 for slice aggregates
      SA1 and SA2 respectively.

   o  A Flexible Algorithm Definition (FAD) for Algorithm 128 is defined
      by the user such that the FAD Metric-Type is 1 (Min Unidirectional
      Link Delay).

   o  Node R5 assigns two Algorithm 128 SA Prefix-SIDs, index=815, and
      index=825 to represent the least delay path to R5 for slice
      aggregates SA1 and SA2 respectively.

   o  All routers in the network participate and advertise their
      capability to compute FAD 128 Prefix-SID paths.

   Using the approach described in this section, R1 is able to forward
   packets that traverse slices aggregates SA1 and SA2 along the least
   delay path by imposing the MPLS SR SID 16815, and 16825 respectively.

   In addition, R1 is able to forward packets that traverse slice
   aggregate SA1 and SA2 along the IGP shortest path to R5 by imposing
   the MPLS SR SID 16015, and 16025 respectively.

   Figure 1: Example of forwarding over slice aggregates using SR Paths.

2.2.2.  Global Identifier as Slice Selector

   It is possible that the forwarding action and the per-hop behavior
   treatment is derived from different fields carried in a packet.  For
   example, a packet can carry a global slice selector field that can be
   used to define the forwarding treatment while the forwarding next-hop
   relies on the SR topological SIDs.  This makes the slice aggregate
   identification independent of the topology or the destination of the
   packet, and thus, allows for scalable slice aggregates.

   The Slice aggregate Selector (SS) is carried in each packet destined
   to any topological element and that is to be steered over the slice
   aggregate.  For example, the slice aggregate SS can be carried in an
   MPLS label that is present in an MPLS packet's label stack.  It is



Saad, et al.             Expires August 26, 2021                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft       Scalable Network Slices over SR       February 2021


   possible, also, to have a range of MPLS labels to represent the SS
   associated with slice aggregate.

   When the slice aggregate is realized over an IPv6 dataplane, the SS
   can be encoded in the IP header.  For example, the SS can be encoded
   in a portion of the IPv6 Flow Label field as described in
   [I-D.filsfils-spring-srv6-stateless-slice-id].

   Routers within the network use the topological SR segment SIDs to
   determine the forwarding action (next-hop selection), and use the
   slice aggregate selector to enforce the dataplane policy (e.g., as
   defined by the slice policy in [I-D.bestbar-teas-ns-packet]).

   The SS label may be embedded at different positions in the MPLS label
   stack.  For example, the SS label MAY be located at the top of the
   MPLS packet label stack and maintained, by each hop, while the packet
   is forwarded along the SR path.  However, since assigning a global
   MPLS label on all nodes for the SS may not be always feasible, an
   alternative is to assign a global Index for a Slice Aggregate
   Selector (SA Selector Index).  In this case, the SA Selector Index is
   used to determine the actual MPLS label value (e.g., from the router
   Global Label Block) on a given router.

   The SS label can also reside at the bottom of the label stack.  For
   example, a range of VPN service labels may also serve as a SS to map
   traffic from multiple VPNs to the same slice aggregate.

   Another option is to encode the SS as part of a well-known label such
   as Entropy Label (EL) as suggested in
   [I-D.decraene-mpls-slid-encoded-entropy-label-id].  This optimizes
   the number of the MPLS labels needed in the stack and provides an
   ease incremental deployment.

   Lastly, a new Special Purpose Label- e.g., Slice Selector Indicator
   (SSI)- from the MPLS the Base Special-Purpose MPLS Label, or Extended
   Special-Purpose MPLS Label spaces can be used to indicate that a SS
   label immediately follows the SSI.  In this case, the ingress router
   of slice aggregate boundary will impose at least two additional MPLS
   labels (SSI + SS) to identify the packets that belong to the slice
   aggregate.

   This approach reduces the amount of state required to be stored on a
   router to allow forwarding over slice aggregates since it does not
   require a Prefix-SID state per slice aggregate in the control plane,
   nor in the forwarding plane.

   To illustrate forwarding over slice aggregates using a SS label, we
   consider the same network described earlier in Figure 1, but with
   some changes in the configuration:

   o  Node R5 assigns an Algorithm 0 Prefix-SID of index=5 to represent
      the shortest IGP path from any router to R5.

   o  Node R5 assigns Algorithm 128 Prefix-SID of index=805 to represent
      the least delay path from any router to R5.

   o  All routers in the network participate and advertise their
      capability to compute FAD 128 Prefix-SID paths.

   o  The SS labels 1001 and 1002 are used for packets that require to
      be forwarded over slice aggregates SA1 and SA2 respectively.

   Using the approach described in this section, R1 is able to forward
   packets that traverse slice aggregate SA1 and SA2 along the least
   delay path by imposing the following labels {16805, SSI, 1001} and
   {16805, SSI, 1002} respectively.

   Similarly, R1 is able to forward packets that traverse over slice
   aggregates SA1 and SA2 along the IGP shortest path to R5 by imposing
   the following labels {16005, SSI, 1001} and {16005, SSI, 1002}
   respectively.  The path that the packets traverse in each of the
   above case remains as described in Figure 1.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

4.  Security Considerations

   The main goal of network slicing is to allow for some level of
   isolation for traffic from multiple different network slices that are
   utilizing a common network infrastructure and to allow for different
   levels of services to be provided for traffic traversing a single
   slice aggregate resource(s).

   A variety of techniques may be used to achieve this, but the end
   result will be that some packets may be mapped to specific
   resource(s) and may receive different (e.g., better) service
   treatment than others.  The mapping of network traffic to a specific
   slice is indicated primarily by the SS, and hence an adversary may be
   able to utilize resource(s) allocated to a specific network slice by
   injecting packets carrying the same SS field in their packets.

   Such theft-of-service may become a denial-of-service attack when the
   modified or injected traffic depletes the resources available to
   forward legitimate traffic belonging to a specific slice aggregate.

   The defense against this type of theft and denial-of-service attacks
   consists of the combination of traffic conditioning at network
   slicing domain boundaries with security and integrity of the network
   infrastructure within a network slicing domain.
