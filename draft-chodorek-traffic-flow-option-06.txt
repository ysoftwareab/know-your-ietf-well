               An IP option for describing the traffic flow
                   draft-chodorek-traffic-flow-option-06


Abstract

   Information about the behavior of the stream that will be transmitted
   in the near future will allow for better management of queues in the
   router and thus improve QoS and reduce the potential for a serious
   overload. Such information is often available in the transmitter. The
   proposed IP option allows for the sending of information about
   forthcoming traffic from the transmitter to the intermediate nodes.

1. Introduction

   Information about the behavior of the stream that will be transmitted
   in the near future will allow for better management of queues in the
   router and thus improve QoS and reduce the potential for a serious
   overload. Such information is often available in the transmitter.
   Information on the amount of data that in the near future will be
   sent by the application can be derived from measurements taken in the
   output buffer or as a result of prediction (e.g. the prediction of
   video traffic [Cho2002]). This information can be used for dynamic
   bandwidth allocation (e.g. the extension to RSVP protocol, based on
   dynamic resource reservations [Cho2010] or prediction-based bandwidth
   renegotiation module [Cho2003]).

   The proposed IP Traffic Flow Description (TFD) Hop-by-Hop option
   allows for the sending of information about forthcoming traffic from
   the transmitter to the intermediate nodes. The proposed IP option can
   be used by applications which transmit streaming and elastic traffic.
   The proposed option will be used mainly for streaming applications
   because streaming applications are typically self-limited (have a
   limited output bandwidth depending to properties of transmitted media
   and used compression and coding).

   The proposed option can be used to active queues (e.g. RED) or fair
   queuing (e.g. WFQ).

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

2. Traffic Flow Description option

      The Traffic Flow Description (TFD) header is used by an IP source
   to carry information describing traffic flow. This option must be
   examined by every node along a packet's delivery path.

   The proposed IPv4 [RFC791] option has the following format:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   100xxxxx    |      Len      |             Flags             |
   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   |                           Next Data                           |
   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   |                           Next Time                           |
   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+

                   Figure 1 Proposed IP Option for IPv4.



   The proposed IPv6 [RFC2460] Hop-by-Hop Options has the following
   format:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Option Type  |  Opt Data Len |             Flags             |
   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   |                           Next Data                           |
   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   |                           Next Time                           |
   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+

                   Figure 2 Proposed IP Option for IPv6.



   For IPv4 the first byte (the option type) is as follows:

   Type:

     Copied flag:  1 (all fragments must carry the option)

     Option class: 0 (control)

     Option number: xxxxx to be allocated by IANA for this option

   For IPv6 the Traffic Flow Description header is identified by a
   Option Type value of 000xxxxx, and is as follows:

     Unrecognized option action: 00
              (skip option, process the rest of the header)

     Option Data does not change en-route: 0
              (option data cannot change while the datagram is en route)

     Option number: xxxxx to be allocated by IANA for this option



   Option Type (8 bit):

     Identifies the type of option.



   For IPv4:

   Len (8 bit):

     Variable length of IP option in bytes (including the Type and Len
   bytes). This field MUST be set to 12.

   For IPv6:

   Opt Data Len (8 bit):

     Length of IP option in bytes. This field MUST be set to 10.



   Flags (16 bit):

     Determines the format of next field and the properties (types) of
   the transmitted data, and has the following format:

      |        Res      |D|M|B|F|L|S|E|
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Res (9 bit):

     The Res (Reserved) field MUST be set to zero

   D (1 bit):

     Size in field Next Data represents:
       0 Positive integer value
       1 Floating-point value

   M (1 bit):

      When the flag M is set to one, this indicates that the value of
   the Next Data field is set in the transmitter to a maximum value for
   the transmission.

   B (1 bit):

      When the flag B is set to one, this indicates that the value of
   the Next Data field is set in the transmitter on the basis of buffer
   analysis.

   F (1 bit):

      When the flag F is set to one, this indicates that the value of
   the Next Data field is set in the transmitter on the basis of
   prediction.

   S (1 bit): stream traffic indication

     0 No stream
     1 Stream

   E (1 bit): elastic traffic indication

     0 No elastic
     1 Elastic

   Note:

     If S == 1, E MUST be set to 0 and if E == 1, S MUST be set to 0.

   Next Data (32 bit):

     size (in bytes) of data sent in the near future.

       If Flag D is not set (D == 0):

         Next Data = Next Data

         If Flag D is set (D == 1), Next Data represents a floating-
   point value as follows (representation is used in accordance with
   IEEE 754 single precision [IEEE754]):

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |0|     exponent    |             significand_field             |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      Note(1): infinity stream is defined:

          as FFFFFFFF hex value if D == 0
          as exponent = FF and significand_field = 0 if D == 1

      Note(2): sign bit is always zero (positive number).

   Next Time (32 bit):

     Time (in milliseconds) the counting of data that were included in
   the field Next Data.

3. Procedures

   The source node sends a packet with the IP option of the Traffic Flow
   Description. The type of traffic, which can be elastic or streaming,
   and its basic parameters are defined by the application that is
   capable of using the optional Traffic Flow Description. Information
   on the amounts of data that in the near future will sent by the
   application can be derived from measurements taken of the output
   buffer or as a result of prediction.

   Intermediate nodes will receive information transmitted by the
   Traffic Flow Description for each active flow and on the basis of the
   obtained information modify their decisions regarding traffic
   management.

   The proposed option can be used by active queues (e.g. RED) or fair
   queuing (e.g. WFQ) [Cho2015].

3.1. The streaming application

   The streaming application, located at the source node, sets the IP
   packet option of the Traffic Flow Description. Flag S (which
   indicates streaming) is set to 1. When the stream was characterized
   by analyzing the application output buffer, flag B is set to 1. The
   field Next Time is set according to the buffer delay (e.g. 500 ms).
   The value of the field Next Data is set as a sum of all data
   currently stored in output buffer.

3.2. The elastic application

   The elastic application, located at the source node, sets the IP
   packet option of the Traffic Flow Description. The flag E (which
   indicates an elastic application) is set to 1. When an elastic
   application uses the TCP protocol it's a problem to estimate Next
   Data. We can only calculate maximum throughput according to RTT,
   congestion and the receiver window. It will be setting the maximum
   throughput in the Traffic Flow Description by setting flag M to 1 and
   Next Data and Next Time according to a calculation (Next Data to
   calculate throughput and Next Time to RTT). If it is not possible to
   calculate throughput we set Next Data to infinite value and field
   Next Time to RTT.

   When an elastic application uses a transport protocol (e.g. PGM),
   which implements rate limiting mechanisms, we set maximum throughput
   according to protocol settings. The flag E (which indicates an
   elastic application) is set to 1, flag M is set to 1 and Next Data
   and Next Time is set according to protocol settings. If it is
   possible to estimate the throughput of the transport protocol in a
   given period we use this information and set flag F (instead of M) to
   1 and field Next Data and Next Time according to predicted values.

4. Security Considerations

   Security considerations to be provided.

5. IANA Considerations

   An option type must be assigned by IANA for the Traffic Flow
   Description (TFD) option.
