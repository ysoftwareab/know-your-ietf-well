Abstract

   The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to protect the
   quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain.
   The overall rate of the PCN-traffic is metered on every link in the
   PCN-domain, and PCN-packets are appropriately marked when certain
   configured rates are exceeded.  The level of marking allows the
   boundary nodes to make decisions about whether t o admit or block a
   new flow request, and (in abnormal circumstances) whether to
   terminate some of the existing flows, thereby protecting the QoS of
   previously admitted flows.  This document specifies how such marks
   are to be encoded into the IP header by re-using the ECN codepoints
   within this controlled domain.  The baseline encoding described here
   provides for only two PCN encoding states, unmarked and marked.

1.  Introduction

   The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to protect the
   quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain,
   in a simple, scalable and robust fashion.  The overall rate of the
   PCN-traffic is metered on every link in the PCN-domain, and PCN-
   packets are appropriately marked when certain configured rates are
   exceeded.  These configured rates are below the rate of the link thus
   providing notification before any congestion occurs (hence "pre-
   congestion notification").  The level of marking allows the boundary
   nodes to make decisions about whether to admit or block a new flow
   request, and (in abnormal circumstances) whether to terminate some of
   the existing flows, thereby protecting the QoS of previously admitted
   flows.

   This document specifies how these PCN marks are encoded into the IP
   header by re-using the bits of the ECN field.  It also describes how
   packets are identified as belonging to a PCN flow.  Some deployment
   models require two PCN encoding states, others require more.  The
   baseline encoding described here only provides for two PCN encoding
   states.  However the encoding can be easily extended to provide more
   states and rules for such extensions are given in this document.

2.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   The following terms are used in this document:

   o  PCN-compatible Diffserv codepoint - a Diffserv codepoint for which
      the ECN field is used to carry PCN markings rather than [RFC3168]
      markings.

   o  PCN-marked - codepoint indicating packets that have been marked at
      a PCN-interior-node using some PCN marking behaviour
      [I-D.ietf-pcn-marking-behaviour].  Abbreviated to PM.

   o  Not-marked - codepoint indicating packets that are PCN-capable,
      but are not PCN-marked.  Abbreviated to NM.

   o  PCN-enabled codepoints - collective term for all NM and PM
      codepoints.  By definition, packets carrying such codepoints are
      PCN-packets.

   o  not-PCN - packets that are not PCN-enabled.

   In addition, the document uses the terminology defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pcn-architecture].

4.  Encoding two PCN States in IP

   The PCN encoding states are defined using a combination of the DSCP
   and ECN fields within the IP header.  The baseline PCN encoding



Moncaster, et al.        Expires October 9, 2009                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft            Baseline PCN Encoding               April 2009


   closely follows the semantics of ECN [RFC3168].  It allows the
   encoding of two PCN states: Not-marked and PCN-marked.  It also
   allows for traffic that is not PCN-capable to be marked as such (not-
   PCN).  Given the scarcity of codepoints within the IP header the
   baseline encoding leaves one codepoint free for experimental use.
   The following table defines how to encode these states in IP:

   +---------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+---------+
   | ECN codepoint |   Not-ECT   | ECT(0) (10) | ECT(1) (01) | CE (11) |
   |               |     (00)    |             |             |         |
   +---------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+---------+
   |     DSCP n    |   not-PCN   |      NM     |     EXP     |    PM   |
   +---------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+---------+

   Where DSCP n is a PCN-compatible DiffServ codepoint (see Section 4.3)
    and EXP means available for Experimental use.  N.B. we deliberately
   reserve this codepoint for experimental use only (and not local use)
                  to prevent future compatability issues.

                        Table 1: Encoding PCN in IP

   The following rules apply to all PCN traffic:

   o  PCN-traffic MUST be marked with a PCN-compatible DiffServ
      Codepoint.  To conserve DSCPs, DiffServ Codepoints SHOULD be
      chosen that are already defined for use with admission controlled
      traffic, such as the Voice-Admit codepoint defined in
      [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-admitted-realtime-dscp].  Guidelines for mixing
      traffic-types within a PCN-domain are given in
      [I-D.ietf-pcn-marking-behaviour].

   o  Any packet that is not-PCN but which shares the same DiffServ
      codepoint as PCN-enabled traffic MUST have the ECN field equal to
      00.

4.1.  Valid and Invalid Codepoint Transitions

   A PCN-ingress-node MUST set the Not-marked (10) codepoint on any
   arriving packet that belongs to a PCN-flow.  It MUST set the not-PCN
   (00) codepoint on all other packets.

   A PCN-interior-node MUST observe the rules for valid and invalid
   codepoint transitions as set out in the following table.  The precise
   rules governing which valid transition to use are set out in
   [I-D.ietf-pcn-marking-behaviour]

Internet-Draft            Baseline PCN Encoding               April 2009


                  +-------------------------------------------------+
                  |                  Codepoint Out                  |
   +--------------+-------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
   | Codepoint in | not-PCN(00) |   NM(10)  |  EXP(01)  |   PM(11)  |
   +--------------+-------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
   |  not-PCN(00) |    Valid    | Not valid | Not valid | Not valid |
   +--------------+-------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
   |       NM(10) |  Not valid  |   Valid   | Not valid |   Valid   |
   +--------------+-------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
   |     EXP(01)* |  Not valid  | Not valid |   Valid   |   Valid   |
   +--------------+-------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
   |       PM(11) |  Not valid  | Not valid | Not valid |   Valid   |
   +--------------+-------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
   * This SHOULD cause an alarm to be raised at a higher layer. The
       packet MUST be treated as if it carried the NM codepoint.

            Table 2: Valid and Invalid Codepoint Transitions for
                      PCN-packets at PCN-interior-nodes

   A PCN-egress-node SHOULD set the not-PCN (00) codepoint on all
   packets it forwards out of the PCN-domain.  The only exception to
   this is if the PCN-egress-node is certain that revealing other
   codepoints outside the PCN-domain won't contravene the guidance given
   in [RFC4774].

4.2.  Rationale for Encoding

   The exact choice of encoding was dictated by the constraints imposed
   by existing IETF RFCs, in particular [RFC3168], [RFC4301] and
   [RFC4774].  One of the tightest constraints was the need for any PCN
   encoding to survive being tunnelled through either an IP in IP tunnel
   or an IPSec Tunnel.  [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-tunnel] explains this in
   more detail.  The main effect of this constraint is that any PCN
   marking has to carry the 11 codepoint in the ECN field since this is
   the only codepoint that is guaranteeed to be copied down into the
   inner header upon decapsulation.  An additional constraint is the
   need to minimise the use of DiffServ codepoints as there is a limited
   supply of standards track codepoints remaining.  Section 4.3 explains
   how we have minimised this still further by reusing pre-existing
   Diffserv codepoint(s) such that non-PCN traffic can still be
   distinguished from PCN traffic.  There are a number of factors that
   were considered before deciding to set 10 as the NM state.  These
   included similarity to ECN, presence of tunnels within the domain,
   leakage into and out of PCN-domain and incremental deployment (see
   Appendix A.2).

   The encoding scheme above seems to meet all these constraints and
   ends up looking very similar to ECN.  This is perhaps not surprising



Moncaster, et al.        Expires October 9, 2009                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft            Baseline PCN Encoding               April 2009


   given the similarity in architectural intent between PCN and ECN.

4.3.  PCN-Compatible DiffServ Codepoints

   Equipment complying with the baseline PCN encoding MUST allow PCN to
   be enabled for certain Diffserv codepoints.  This document defines
   the term "PCN-compatible Diffserv codepoint" for such a DSCP.  To be
   clear, any packets with such a DSCP will be PCN enabled only if they
   also have their ECN field set to indicate a codepoint other than not-
   PCN.

   Enabling PCN marking behaviour disables any other marking behaviour
   (e.g. enabling PCN disables the default ECN marking behaviour
   introduced in [RFC3168]).  All traffic scheduling and conditioning
   behaviours are discussed in [I-D.ietf-pcn-marking-behaviour].  This
   ensures compliance with the BCP guidance set out in [RFC4774].

5.  Rules for Experimental Encoding Schemes

   Any experimental encoding scheme MUST follow these rules to ensure
   backward compatibility with this baseline scheme:

   o  The 00 codepoint in the ECN field SHALL indicate not-PCN and MUST
      NOT be changed to any otehr codepoint within a PCN-domain.
      Therefore an ingress node wishing to disable PCN marking for a
      packet within a PCN-compatible DiffServ Codepoint MUST set the ECN
      field to 00.

   o  The 11 codepoint in the ECN field SHALL indicate PCN-marked
      (though this does not exclude the 01 Experimental codepoint from
      carrying the same meaning).

   o  Once set, the 11 codepoint in the ECN field MUST NOT be changed to
      any other codepoint.

   o  Any experimental scheme MUST include details of all valid and
      invalid codepoint transitions at any PCN nodes.

   o  Any experimental scheme MUST NOT update the meaning of the 00 and
      11 codepoints defined above.

6.  Backwards Compatibility

   BCP 124 [RFC4774] gives guidelines for specifying alternative
   semantics for the ECN field.  It sets out a number of factors to be
   taken into consideration.  It also suggests various techniques to
   allow the co-existence of default ECN and alternative ECN semantics.
   The baseline encoding specified in this document defines PCN-



Moncaster, et al.        Expires October 9, 2009                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft            Baseline PCN Encoding               April 2009


   compatible DiffServ codepoints as no longer supporting the default
   ECN semantics.  As such this document is compatible with BCP 124.  It
   should be noted that this baseline encoding effectively disables end-
   to-end ECN except where mechanisms are put in place to tunnel such
   traffic across the PCN-domain.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request to IANA.

8.  Security Considerations

   PCN-marking only carries a meaning within the confines of a PCN-
   domain.  Packets wishing to be treated as belonging to a PCN-flow
   must carry a PCN-Compatible DSCP and a PCN-Enabled ECN codepoint.
   This encoding document is intended to stand independently of the
   architecture used to determine whether specific packets are
   authorised to be PCN-marked, which will be described in separate
   documents on PCN edge-node behaviour.

   This document assumes the PCN-domain to be entirely under the control
   of a single operator, or a set of operators who trust each other.
   However future extensions to PCN might include inter-domain versions
   where trust cannot be assumed between domains.  If such schemes are
   proposed they must ensure that they can operate securely despite the
   lack of trust but such considerations are beyond the scope of this
   document.

9.  Conclusions

   This document defines the baseline PCN encoding utilising a
   combination of a PCN-enabled DSCP and the ECN field in the IP header.
   This baseline encoding allows the existence of two PCN encoding
   states, not-Marked and PCN-marked.  It also allows for the co-
   existence of competing traffic within the same DSCP so long as that
   traffic does not require ECN support within the PCN-domain.  The
   encoding scheme is conformant with [RFC4774].

Appendix A.  PCN Deployment Considerations

A.1.  Choice of Suitable DSCPs

   The PCN Working Group chose not to define a single DSCP for use with
   PCN for several reasons.  Firstly the PCN mechanism is applicable to
   a variety of different traffic classes.  Secondly standards track
   DSCPs are in increasingly short supply.  Thirdly PCN should be seen
   as being essentially a marking behaviour similar to ECN but intended
   for inelastic traffic.  The choice of which DSCP is most suitable for
   a given PCN-domain is dependant on the nature of the traffic entering
   that domain and the link rates of all the links making up that
   domain.  In PCN-domains with uniformly high link rates, the
   appropriate DSCPs would currently be those for the Real Time Traffic
   Class [RFC5127].  If the PCN domain includes lower speed links it
   would also be appropriate to use the DSCPs of the other traffic
   classes that [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-admitted-realtime-dscp] defines for use
   with admission control, such as the three video classes CS4, CS3 and
   AF4 and the Admitted Telephony Class.

A.2.  Rationale for Using ECT(0) for Not Marked

   The choice of which ECT codepoint to use for the Not Marked state was
   based on the following considerations:

   o  [RFC3168] full functionality tunnel within the PCN-domain: Either
      ECT is safe.

   o  Leakage of traffic into PCN-domain: ECT(1) is slightly less likely
      to occur so might be considered safer.

   o  Leakage of traffic out of PCN-domain: Either ECT is equally unsafe
      (since this would incorrectly indicate the traffic was ECN-capable
      outside the controlled PCN-domain).

   o  Incremental deployment: Either codepoint is suitable providing
      that the codepoints are used consistently.

   o  Conceptual consistency with other schemes: ECT(0) is conceptually
      consistent with [RFC3168].

   Overall this seemed to suggest ECT(0) was most appropriate to use.
