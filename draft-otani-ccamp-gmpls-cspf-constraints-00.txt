                  This draft provides the guideline to consider generalized multi-
                  protocol label switching (GMPLS) traffic-engineering (TE) attributes 
                  for constraint-based shortest path first (CSFP) path computation at a 
                  source node in a GMPLS network environment. This draft summarizes 
                  most possible cases of GMPLS constraint TE attributes at an ingress 
                  node, transiting nodes and an egress node to establish a GMPLS label 
                  switched path (LSP) appropriately.

               1. Introduction 
                   
                  A GMPLS network is, in general, controlled and managed by various 
                  GMPLS specific TE attributes underlying used physical/logical 
                  technologies of nodes as well as links [Arch]. To establish a GMPLS 
                  LSP appropriately in such a networking environment, these TE 
                  attributes (advertised from others or belonging to themselves) must 
                  be deal with correctly when CSPF path computation under a certain 
                  GMPLS constraint is conducted [GMPLS-routing], and GMPLS LSP must be 
                  created following an appropriate route. However, since these 
                  attributes varies and are differently understood among such an 
                  industrial environment (especially between optical transport point of 
                  view and packet transport point of view), this draft proposes and 
                  provides a kind of guideline to facilitate GMPLS CSFP path 
                  computation, summarizing most possible cases of GMPLS constraint 
                  attributes at an ingress node, transiting nodes and an egress node to 
                  establish a GMPLS LSP appropriately.

                  3.1 GMPLS TE attributes consideration for CSPF calculation 
                   
                  For CSPF path computation to establish GMPLS LSPs correctly, various 
                  GMPLS attributes [GMPLS-routing, GMPLS-OSPF] of nodes as well as TE 
                  links, as indicated below, must be took into account in a GMPLS 
                  network environment in addition to TE attributes of packet based 
                  network [OSPF-TE]. 
                   
                       (1) Encoding-type: SONET/SDH, Lambda, Ethernet, etc. 
                       (2) Switching capability: TDM, Lambda, fiber, etc. 
                       (3) Bandwidth: OC-192, OC-48, GbE, 10GbE, etc. 
                   
                  These logical attributes have a very tight relationship with 
                  underlying physical technologies such as SONET/SDH, optical transport 
                  network (OTN) or Ethernet in terms of links, and all-optical switches, 
                  SONET/SDH-basis digital cross connect or electrical-basis optical 
                  switches in terms of nodes.  Therefore, the created GMPLS LSPs must 
                  satisfy logical constrains as well as corresponding physical 
                  constraints. These constraints are sometimes differently understood 
                  among industries, and a logically computed GMPLS LSP may violate the 
                  physical constraints, therefore, the consistent guideline to solve 
                  this issue should be formulated.

                  3.2 Considered network model 
                   
                  Figure 1 depicts a typical GMPLS network, consisting of an ingress 
                  node, transiting nodes as well as an egress node, to investigate a 
                  consistent guideline for GMPLS CSPF path computation. Each node has 
                  its own switching capability of sc^in, sc^tr, or sc^eg, and each TE 
                  link generating or terminating at each node has its own encoding-type 
                  of enc^in, enc^tr or enc^eg, and bandwidth of bw^in, bw^tr or bw^eg. 
                  The consideration here is based on a single domain GMPLS network, but 
                  the analysis may be able to be applicable to an inter-domain GMPLS 
                  network. 
                   
                   
                  Ingress                      Transit                      Egress 
                  +-----+ Enc.:enc^in          +-----+ Enc.:enc^tr          +-----+

                  |     |<---------//--------->|     |<---------//--------->|     | 
                  +-----+            BW: bw^tr +-----+            BW: bw^eg +-----+ 
                   
                   
                                      Figure 1: GMPLS network model 
                   
                   
                  For the simplicity of the analysis in CSPF consideration, the below 
                  assumptions are made when the LSP is created. 
                   
                       (1) Switching capability (SC) must be consistent from an ingress 
                           node to an egress node. 
                       (2) SC of transit nodes must be consistent with SC of a LSP to 
                           be created. 
                       (3) Encoding-type must be consistent along a route to be 
                           established. 
                   
                  BW of each TE link (bw^in, bw^tr and be^eg) is minimal of unreserved 
                  bandwidth or interface switching capability description maximum LSP 
                  bandwidth [GMPLS-OSPF, OSPF-TE]. 
                   
                  Multi-layered consideration in terms of switching capability or 
                  encoding-types will be a next step and currently out of scope of this 
                  document. 
                   
                   
               4. CSPF consideration 
                
                  In this section, we consider GMPLS constrains to be satisfied in 
                  different cases of transiting nodes∆ switching capability.  When a 
                  LSP indicated in below tables is created, the CSPF path computation 
                  must choose the route so as to satisfy switching capability, 
                  encoding-type and bandwidth at the ingress node, transiting nodes and 
                  the egress node indicated in columns next to the creating LSP, 
                  considering underlying physical constraints. Here, almost cases of

                  GMPLS CSFP consideration are summarized in this document, however, 
                  some cases will be added in a future version.

                  * OTN interfaces are equivalent to digital wrapper technology. 
                  * <=TDM means that the constraint contains smaller granular switching 
                  capability of PSC and L2SC, in addition to TDM.  In below cases, this 
                  notation indicates the same meaning.

                  In this case, since the node with TDM SC supports sub-rate switching, 
                  BW X can be equal to or less than bw^so, bw^tr and bw^en.

                           Table 2: Desired GMPLS attributes in the case of LSC 
                   
                  Because the node with lambda SC supports only optical signal 
                  switching, BW X must be equal to bw^so, bw^tr and bw^en except in the 
                  case of the encoding-type of lambda.

                           Table 3: Desired GMPLS attributes in the case of FSC 
                   
                   
                  The node with fiber SC supports only optical wavelength or waveband 
                  switching, and therefore, the encoding type must be lambda and BW X 
                  must be equal to or less than bw^so, bw^tr and bw^en. 
                   
                   
                  (4) Layer 2 switch capable (L2SC) 
                   
                  The guideline for the calculation must be created after the 
                  definition and discussion L2SW are settled down.

                           Table 4: Desired GMPLS attributes in the case of PSC 
                   
                   
                  Since the node with PSC supports only packet switching, BW X must be 
                  equal to or less than bw^so, bw^tr and bw^en. 
                   
                  These GMPLS constraints must be considered for computing CSPF and 
                  creating GMPLS LSPs.

               5. Security consideration 
                   
                  GMPLS CSPF consideration will not change the underlying security 
                  issues.
