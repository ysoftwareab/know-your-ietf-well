2.  Abstract

     The schema defined in this document is a minimal schema to  support
     PKIX  in  an  LDAPv2  environment,  as  defined in draft-ietf-pkix-
     ipki2opp-07.txt. Only PKIX-specific components are specified  here.
     LDAP  servers, acting as PKIX repositories should support the auxi-
     liary object classes defined in this  specification  and  integrate
     this  schema  specification with the generic and other application-
     specific schemas as appropriate, depending on the  services  to  be
     supplied by that server.

     The key words  "MUST",  "REQUIRED",  "SHOULD",  "RECOMMENDED",  and
     "MAY"  in  this  document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
     2119.

     Please send comments on this document to  the  ietf-pkix@tandem.com

INTERNET DRAFT                                               August 1998


3.  Introduction

     This specification is part of a multi-part standard for development
     of  a  Public  Key Infrastructure (PKI) for the Internet. LDAPv2 is
     one mechanism defined for access to a PKI repository. Other mechan-
     isms,  such  as http, are also defined. If an LDAP server, accessed
     by LDAPv2 is used to provide a repository, the minimum  requirement
     is  that  the repository support the addition of X.509 certificates
     to directory  entries.  Certificate  Revocation  List  (CRL)is  one
     mechanism  for  publishing  revocation information in a repository.
     Other mechanisms, such as http, are also defined.

     This specification defines the attributes and object classes to  be
     used  by  LDAP servers acting as PKIX repositories and to be under-
     stood by LDAP  clients  communicating  with  such  repositories  to
     query,  add, modify and delete PKI information. Some object classes
     and attributes defined in X.509 are duplicated here  for  complete-
     ness. For end entities and Certification Authorities (CA), the ear-
     lier X.509 defined object classes mandated inclusion of  attributes
     which  are optional for PKIX. Also, because of the mandatory attri-
     bute specification, this would have required  dynamic  modification
     of  the  object class attribute should the attributes not always be
     present in entries. For these reasons, alternative  object  classes
     are defined in this document for use by LDAP servers acting as PKIX
     repositories.

4.  PKIX Repository Objects

     The primary PKIX objects to be represented in a repository are:

        -  End Entities
        -  Certification Authorities (CA)

     These objects are defined in draft-ietf-pkix-ipki-part1-09.txt.

4.1.  End Entities

     For purposes of PKIX schema definition, the role of end entities as
     subjects  of  certificates  is  the  major  aspect relevant to this
     specification. End entities may be human users, or other  types  of
     entities  to  which  certificates may be issued. In some cases, the
     entry for the end entity may already  exist  and  the  PKI-specific
     information  is  added  to  the  existing entry. In other cases the
     entry may not exist prior to the  issuance  of  a  certificate,  in
     which  case  the  entity  adding  the  certificate may also need to
     create the entry. Schema elements used to represent  the  non  PKIX
     aspects  of  an  entry, such as the structural object class used to
     represent  organizational  persons,  may  vary,  depending  on  the

     particular  environment and set of applications served and are out-
     side the scope of this specification.

     The following auxiliary object class MAY be used to represent  cer-
     tificate subjects:

     pkiUser   OBJECT-CLASS   ::= {
        SUBCLASS OF   { top}
        KIND          auxiliary
        MAY CONTAIN   {userCertificate}
        --ID   { joint-iso-ccitt(2) ds(5) objectClass(6) pkiUser(21)}

     userCertificate    ATTRIBUTE  ::=  {
          WITH SYNTAX   Certificate
          EQUALITY MATCHING RULE   certificateExactMatch
          ID  joint-iso-ccitt(2) ds(5) attributeType(4) userCertificate(36) }

     An end entity may obtain one or more certificates from one or  more
     Certification  Authorities.  The  userCertificate attribute MUST be
     used  to  represent  these  certificates  in  the  directory  entry
     representing that user.

5.  Certification Authorities

     As with  end  entities,  Certification  Authorities  are  typically
     represented  in  directories  as  auxiliary  components  of entries
     representing a more generic object, such as organizations,  organi-
     zational units etc. The non PKIX-specific schema elements for these
     entries, such as the structural object class  of  the  object,  are
     outside the scope of this specification.

     The following auxiliary object class MAY be used to represent  Cer-
     tification Authorities:

     pkiCA   OBJECT-CLASS   ::= {
        SUBCLASS OF   { top}
        KIND          auxiliary
        MAY CONTAIN   {cACertificate |
                       certificateRevocationList |
                       authorityRevocationList |
                       crossCertificatePair }
        --ID   { joint-iso-ccitt(2) ds(5) objectClass(6) pkiCA(22)}

     cACertificate    ATTRIBUTE  ::=  {
          WITH SYNTAX   Certificate
          EQUALITY MATCHING RULE   certificateExactMatch
          ID  joint-iso-ccitt(2) ds(5) attributeType(4) cACertificate(37) }

     The cACertificate attribute, held in a  particular  CA's  directory
     entry, may be used to store self-signed certificates.

     certificateRevocationListATTRIBUTE::={
        WITH SYNTAX  CertificateList
        EQUALITY MATCHING RULE certificateListExactMatch
     ID joint-iso-ccitt(2) ds(5) attributeType(4) certificateRevocationList(39)}

     The certificateRevocationList attribute, if present in a particular
     CA's  entry,  contains  CRL(s)  as defined in draft-ietf-pkix-ipki-
     part1-08.txt.

     authorityRevocationListATTRIBUTE::={
        WITH SYNTAX   CertificateList
        EQUALITY MATCHING RULE certificateListExactMatch
      ID joint-iso-ccitt(2) ds(5) attributeType(4) authorityRevocationList(38)}

     The authorityRevocationList attribute, if present in  a  particular
     CA's  entry, includes revocation information regarding certificates
     issued to other CAs.

     crossCertificatePairATTRIBUTE::={
        WITH SYNTAX   CertificatePair
        EQUALITY MATCHING RULE certificatePairExactMatch
      ID joint-iso-ccitt(2) ds(5) attributeType(4) crossCertificatePair(40)}

     The crossCertificatePair  attribute,  held  in  a  particular  CA's
     directory  entry,  may be used to store certificates issued by this
     CA to other CAs, as well as certificates  issued  for  this  CA  by
     other  CAs.  Values  held  in  the forward element are certificates
     issued for this CA by other CAs, while values in the  reverse  ele-
     ment  are certificates issued by this CA for other CAs. Either cer-
     tificate, if present,  may be used in  building  certificate  paths
     for  validation  and  may  be published in the directory entries of
     either CA or both.

5.0.1.  CRL distribution points

     CRL distribution points are an  optional  mechanism,  specified  in
     draft-ietf-pkix-ipki-part1-08.txt,  which MAY be used to distribute
     revocation information.

     A patent statement regarding CRL distribution points can  be  found
     at the end of this document.

     If a CA elects to use CRL distribution points, the following object
     class is used to represent these.

     cRLDistributionPoint   OBJECT-CLASS::= {
        SUBCLASS OF     { top }
        KIND            structural
        MUST CONTAIN    { commonName }
        MAY CONTAIN     { certificateRevocationList |

        ID joint-iso-ccitt(2) ds(5) objectClass(6) cRLDistributionPoint(19) }

     The certificateRevocationList  and  authorityRevocationList  attri-
     butes are as defined above.

     The  commonName  attribute  and   deltaRevocationList   attributes,
     defined in X.509, are duplicated below.

     commonName   ATTRIBUTE::={
        SUBTYPE OF     name
        WITH SYNTAX   DirectoryString
        ID joint-iso-ccitt(2) ds(5) attributeType(4) commonName(3) }

     deltaRevocationList        ATTRIBUTE ::= {
        WITH SYNTAX             CertificateList
        EQUALITY MATCHING RULE  certificateListExactMatch
        ID joint-iso-ccitt(2) ds(5) attributeType(4) deltaRevocationList(53) }

6.  Security Considerations

     Since the elements of information which are key to the PKI  service
     (certificates  and CRLs) are both digitally signed pieces of infor-
     mation, no additional integrity service is REQUIRED.

     Security considerations with respect to retrieval, addition,  dele-
     tion,  and modification of the information supported by this schema
     definition are addressed in draft-ietf-pkix-ipki-ldapv2-08.txt.
