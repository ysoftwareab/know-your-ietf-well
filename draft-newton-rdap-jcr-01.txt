Internet-Draft                JCR for RDAP                    March 2016


1.  Introduction

   The JSON [RFC7159] responses of the Registration Data Access Protocol
   [RFC7483] are officially defined with English prose.  Those
   definitions contain imprecise or ambiguous JSON structures and
   require lengthy, tedious examples in the attempt to offer
   clarification.  The English prose can be difficult for non-native
   English readers, and the examples create their own confusion.

   This document describes the JSON found in RDAP with JSON Content
   Rules [I-D.newton-json-content-rules] (JCR).

   JCR overcomes some of the obstacles of describing JSON with English
   prose, reducing the tediousness of the prose and accompanying lengthy
   examples to understandable data structures.  Additionally, JCR has
   mechanisms which can be used by software developers to create test
   harnesses and technology compatibility kits.

   Though this document describes all of the JSON found in [RFC7483], it
   presents the structures in a different order.  The rules defined here
   use the JCR mixin style of specification, where common structures are
   defined in group rules instead of separately, distinct objects.

2.  Response

   [RFC7483] describes ten distinct JSON response: five entity class
   response, an error response, a help response, and three search
   responses.

       entity_response           @{root} { response_mixin,
                                           entity_mixin           }
       nameserver_response       @{root} { response_mixin,
                                           nameserer_mixin        }
       domain_response           @{root} { response_mixin,
                                           domain_mixin           }
       network_response          @{root} { response_mixin,
                                           network_mixin          }
       autnum_response           @{root} { response_mixin,
                                           autnum_mixin           }
       error_response            @{root} { response_mixin,
                                           error_mixin            }
       help_response             @{root} { response_mixin         }
       domainSearch_response     @{root} { response_mixin,
                                           domainSearchResult     }

                                           entitySearchResult     }

   All of the responses have a common set of object members described by
   response_mixin.

       response_mixin (
          ? rdapConformance,
          ? "notices" notices,
            lang
       )

3.  Object Classes

   The primary data structures in RDAP are called object classes.  These
   are first order object instances with identifiers.  They are JSON
   objects which contain other JSON data types.

3.1.  Entity Object Class

   The Entity object class represents persons or organizations.  It
   incorporates jCard [RFC7095] (vCard in JSON) for contact information.
   The rules supplied here only provide for a basic validation of jCard,
   as the validation of jCard is beyond the scope of this document.

       entity_oc {

              ( :string | [ * :string ] )
            ]
       ]

3.2.  Nameserver Object Class

   The nameserver object class represents DNS nameservers in registries.

       nameservers "nameservers" [ * nameserver_oc ]

       nameserver_oc {
          nameserver_mixin
       }

       nameserver_mixin (

            common_mixin,
            "ldhName"         : fqdn,
          ? "unicodeName"     : idn,
          ? "ipAddresses      { ? "v4" [ * ip4 ], ? "ip6" [ * ip6 ] },
          ? entities
       )

3.3.  Domain Object Class

   The Domain object class is the most complex of all the object classes
   defined in RDAP.  It represents both forward and reverse DNS
   delegations.  It's complexity is mostly due to the DNSSEC provisions
   of the object class.

3.4.  IP Network Object Class

   The IP Network object class represents IP network registrations in
   RIRs.

       network_oc {
          network_mixin
       }

       network_mixin (
            "objectClassName" : "ip network",
            common_mixin,
          ? "startAddress"    : ( :ip4 | :ip6 ),
          ? "endAddres"       : ( :ip4 | :ip6 ),
          ? "ipVersion"       : ( :"v4" | :"v6" ),
          ? "name"            : string,
          ? "type"            : string,
          ? "country"         : /[A-Z]{2}/,
          ? "parentHandle"    : string,
          ? entities
       )

3.5.  Autnum Object Class

   The Autnum object class represents an autonomous system number or
   blocks of autonomous system numbers in an RIR.

       autnum_oc {
          autnum_mixin
       }

       autnum_mixin (
            "objectClassName" : "autnum",
            common_mixin,
          ? "startAutnum"     : integer,
          ? "endAutnum"       : integer,
          ? "name"            : string,
          ? "type"            : string,
          ? "entities
       )

4.  Search Results

   Search results in RDAP are merely arrays of object classes.

     domainSearchResult     "domainSearchResult"     [ * domain_oc ]
     nameserverSearchResult "nameserverSearchResult" [ * nameserver_oc ]
     entitySearchResult     "entitySearchResult"     [ * entity_oc ]

5.  Common Structures

   Section 4 of [RFC7483] describes eight common structures used
   throughout the JSON in RDAP.

   Most of these common structures are grouped together in a rule called
   common_mixin.

       common_mixin (
          ? "handle"  : string
          ? "remarks" [ * notice ],
            links,
          ? events,
          ? status,
          ? port43,
            lang
       )

5.1.  RDAP Conformance

   The rdapConformance array is the versioning and capabilities
   negotiation mechanism of RDAP.

       rdapConformance "rdapConformance" [ * :string ]

5.2.  Links

   Structures in RDAP may link to information in other data systems
   using links.  Additionally, RDAP uses "self" links to identify
   instances of RDAP object classes.  The data found in each link is
   described by [RFC5988].

   RDAP links are an array of distinct objects, each representing a
   separate link.

       links ( ? "links" [ * link ] )

       ; see RFC 5988
       link {
          ? "value"    : uri,
          ? "rel"      : string,
            "href"     : uri,
          ? "hreflang" [ * lang_value ],
          ? "title"    : string,
          ? "media"    : string,
          ? "type"     : /[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*\/[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*/
       }

5.3.  Notices And Remarks

   In RDAP, notices and remarks share the same structure.  The
   difference is that notices are meta-data regarding the entirety of a
   response whereas remarks are meta-data covering a specific instance
   of an object class.

       notices [ * notice ]

       notice {
           ? "title"       : string,
             "description" [ * :string ],
           ? "type"        : string,
             links,
             lang
       }

5.4.  Language Identifier

   The "lang" member occurs many RDAP data structures.  And the same
   construct is used in the links structures.

       lang_value : /[a-z]{2}(\-[A-Z][a-zA-Z]*(\-[A-Z]{2})?)?/
       lang ( ? "lang" lang_value )

5.5.  Events

   RDAP events note when a specific action has occured on an object
   instance, and by whom.  The same structure appears in all object
   classes, as well as being re-used by entities embedded by other
   objects.

       events "events" [ * event ]

       event {
            "eventAction" : string,
          ? "eventActor"  : string,
            "eventDate"   : date-time,
            links,
            lang
       }

5.6.  Status

   The status of RDAP object instances is indicated by an array of
   strings, where the value of the strings are registered in an IANA
   registry.

       status "status" [ *: string ]

5.7.  Port 43

   RDAP object classes reference their corresponding Whois
   representation using the "port43" object member.  This is simply a
   string holding the hostname of the Whois service.

       port43 "port43" : string

5.8.  Public IDs

   Some RDAP services are required to identify entities and domains by
   public identifiers, such as ICANN Registrar IDs.  The publicIds
   object member is an array of objects to represent these identifiers.

       publicIds "publicIds" [ * publicId ]

       publicId {
         "type"      : string,
         "identifier": string
       }
