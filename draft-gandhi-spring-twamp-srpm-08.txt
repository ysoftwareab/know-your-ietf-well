 Performance Measurement Using TWAMP Light for Segment Routing Networks
                   draft-gandhi-spring-twamp-srpm-08

Abstract

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  SR is
   applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6
   (SRv6) data planes.  This document specifies procedure for sending
   and processing probe query and response messages for Performance
   Measurement (PM) in Segment Routing networks.  The procedure uses the
   messages defined in RFC 5357 (Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol
   (TWAMP) Light) for Delay Measurement, and uses the messages defined
   in this document for Loss Measurement.  The procedure specified is
   applicable to SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes and is used for both Links
   and end-to-end SR Policies.

1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm and
   greatly simplifies network operations for Software Defined Networks
   (SDNs).  SR is applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-
   MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes.  SR takes advantage of the Equal-
   Cost Multipaths (ECMPs) between source and transit nodes, between
   transit nodes and between transit and destination nodes.  SR Policies
   as defined in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] are used to
   steer traffic through a specific, user-defined paths using a stack of
   Segments.  Built-in SR Performance Measurement (PM) is one of the
   essential requirements to provide Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

   The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) defined in [RFC4656]
   and Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) defined in [RFC5357]
   provide capabilities for the measurement of various performance
   metrics in IP networks using probe messages.  These protocols rely on
   control-channel signaling to establish a test-channel over an UDP
   path.  The TWAMP Light [Appendix I in RFC5357] [BBF.TR-390] provides
   simplified mechanisms for active performance measurement in Customer
   IP networks by provisioning UDP paths and eliminates the control-
   channel signaling.  As described in Appendix A of [RFC8545], TWAMP
   Light mechanism is informative only.  These protocols lack support
   for direct-mode Loss Measurement (LM) to detect actual Customer data
   traffic loss which is required in SR networks.

   This document specifies procedures for sending and processing probe
   query and response messages for Performance Measurement in SR
   networks.  The procedure uses the messages defined in [RFC5357]
   (TWAMP Light) for Delay Measurement (DM), and uses the messages
   defined in this document for Loss Measurement.  The procedure
   specified is applicable to SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes and are used
   for both Links and end-to-end SR Policies.  This document also
   defines mechanisms for handling ECMPs of SR Policies for performance
   delay measurement.  Unless otherwise specified, the messages defined
   in [RFC5357] are not modified by this document.

2.3.  Reference Topology

   In the reference topology shown below, the sender node R1 initiates a
   probe query for performance measurement and the reflector node R5
   sends a probe response for the query message received.  The probe
   response is sent to the sender node R1.  The nodes R1 and R5 may be
   directly connected via a Link or there exists a Point-to-Point (P2P)
   SR Policy [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] on node R1 with
   destination to node R5.  In case of Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP), SR
   Policy originating from source node R1 may terminate on multiple
   destination leaf nodes [I-D.voyer-spring-sr-replication-segment].

3.  Overview

   For one-way, two-way and round-trip delay measurements in Segment
   Routing networks, the probe messages defined in [RFC5357] are used.
   For direct-mode and inferred-mode loss measurements in Segment
   Routing networks, the messages defined in this document are used.
   Separate UDP destination port numbers are user-configured for delay
   and loss measurements.  As specified in [RFC8545], the reflector
   supports the destination UDP port 862 for delay measurement probe
   messages by default.  This UDP port however, is not used for loss
   measurement probe messages defined in this document.  The sender uses
   the UDP port number following the guidelines specified in Section 6
   in [RFC6335].  For both Links and end-to-end SR Policies, no PM
   session for delay or loss measurement is created on the reflector
   node R5 [RFC5357].

   For Performance Measurement, probe query and response messages are
   sent as following:

   o  For Delay Measurement, the probe messages are sent on the
      congruent path of the data traffic by the sender node, and are
      used to measure the delay experienced by the actual data traffic
      flowing on the Links and SR Policies.

   o  For Loss Measurement, the probe messages are sent on the congruent
      path of the data traffic by the sender node, and are used to

      collect the receive traffic counters for the incoming link or
      incoming SID where the probe query messages are received at the
      reflector node (incoming link or incoming SID needed since the
      reflector node does not have PM session state present).

   The In-Situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM)
   mechanisms for SR-MPLS defined in [I-D.gandhi-mpls-ioam-sr] and for
   SRv6 defined in [I-D.ali-spring-ioam-srv6] are used to carry PM
   information such as timestamp in-band as part of the data packets,
   and are outside the scope of this document.

3.1.  Example Provisioning Model

   An example of a provisioning model and typical measurement parameters
   for each user-configured destination UDP port for performance delay
   and loss measurements is shown in the following Figure 1:

                   Figure 1: Example Provisioning Model

   Example of Measurement Protocol is TWAMP Light, the Timestamp Format
   is PTPv2 [IEEE1588] or NTP and the Loss Measurement mode is inferred-
   mode or direct-mode.  The mechanisms to provision the sender and
   reflector nodes are outside the scope of this document.

   The reflector node R5 uses the parameters for the timestamp format
   and delay measurement mode (i.e. one-way, two-way or loopback mode)
   from the received probe query message.

4.  Probe Messages

4.1.  Probe Query Message

   The probe messages defined in [RFC5357] are used for Delay
   Measurement for Links and end-to-end SR Policies.  For Loss
   Measurement, the probe messages defined in this document are used.

   The Sender IPv4 or IPv6 address is used as the source address.  When
   known, the reflector IPv4 or IPv6 address is used as the destination
   address.  If not known, the address in the range of 127/8 for IPv4 or
   0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:7F00/104 for IPv6 is used as destination address.
   This is the case for example, when using SR Policy with IPv4 endpoint
   of 0.0.0.0 or IPv6 endpoint of ::0
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].

4.1.1.  Delay Measurement Query Message

   The message content for Delay Measurement probe query message using
   UDP header [RFC0768] is shown in Figure 2.  The DM probe query
   message is sent with user-configured Destination UDP port number for
   DM.  The Destination UDP port cannot be used as Source port, since
   the message does not have any indication to distinguish between the
   query and response message.  The payload of the DM probe query
   message contains the delay measurement message defined in
   Section 4.1.2 of [RFC5357].  For symmetrical size query and response
   messages as defined in [RFC6038], the DM probe query message contains
   the payload format defined in Section 4.2.1 of [RFC5357].

   Timestamp field is eight bytes and use the format defined in
   Section 4.2.1 of [RFC5357].  It is recommended to use the IEEE 1588v2
   Precision Time Protocol (PTP) truncated 64-bit timestamp format
   [IEEE1588] as specified in [RFC8186], with hardware support in
   Segment Routing networks.

4.1.1.1.  Delay Measurement Authentication Mode

   When using the authenticated mode for delay measurement, the matching
   authentication type (e.g.  HMAC-SHA-256) and key are user-configured
   on both the sender and reflector nodes.  A separate user-configured
   destination UDP port is used for the delay measurement in
   authentication mode due to the different probe message format.

4.1.2.  Loss Measurement Query Message

   The message content for Loss Measurement probe query message using
   UDP header [RFC0768] is shown in Figure 3.  The LM probe query
   message is sent with user-configured Destination UDP port number for
   LM, which is a different Destination UDP port number than DM.
   Separate Destination UDP ports are used for direct-mode and inferred-
   mode loss measurements.  The Destination UDP port cannot be used as
   Source port, since the message does not have any indication to
   distinguish between the query and response message.  The LM probe
   query message contains the payload for loss measurement as defined in
   Figure 7 and Figure 8.

4.1.2.1.  Loss Measurement Authentication Mode

   When using the authenticated mode for loss measurement, the matching
   authentication type (e.g.  HMAC-SHA-256) and key are user-configured
   on both the sender and reflector nodes.  A separate user-configured
   destination UDP port is used for the loss measurement in
   authentication mode due to the different message format.

4.1.3.  Probe Query for Links

   The probe query message as defined in Figure 2 for delay measurement
   and Figure 3 for loss measurement is sent on the congruent path of
   the data traffic.  The probe messages are routed over the Link for
   both delay and loss measurement.

4.1.4.  Probe Query for End-to-end Measurement for SR Policy

   The performance delay and loss measurement for segment routing is
   applicable to both SR-MPLS and SRv6 Policies.

4.1.4.1.  Probe Query Message for SR-MPLS Policy

   The probe query messages for end-to-end performance measurement of an
   SR-MPLS Policy is sent using its SR-MPLS header containing the MPLS
   segment list as shown in Figure 4.

   For delay measurement of SRv6 Policy using SRH, END function END.OTP
   [I-D.ietf-6man-spring-srv6-oam] is used with the target SRv6 SID to
   punt probe messages on the target node, as shown in Figure 5.
   Similarly, for loss measurement of SRv6 Policy, END function END.OP
   [I-D.ietf-6man-spring-srv6-oam] is used with target SRv6 SID to punt
   probe messages on the target node.

4.1.5.  Control Code Field for TWAMP Light Messages

   The Control Code field is defined for delay and loss measurement
   probe query and response messages for TWAMP Light in unauthenticated
   and authenticated modes.  The modified delay measurement probe query
   and response message format is shown in Figure 6.  This message
   format is backwards compatible with the message format defined in
   [RFC5357] as its reflectors ignore the received field (previously
   identified as MBZ).  The usage of the Control Code is not limited to
   the SR networks and can be used for various bidirectional paths in a
   network.

4.1.6.  Loss Measurement Query Message Formats for TWAMP Light

   In this document, TWAMP Light probe query message formats are defined
   for loss measurement as shown in Figure 7 and Figure 8.  The message
   formats are hardware efficient due to the well-known locations of the
   counters.  They are similar to the delay measurement message formats
   (e.g. location of the Counter and Timestamp) and do not require any
   backwards compatibility or support for the existing DM message
   formats from [RFC5357] as different user-configured destination UDP
   port is used for loss measurement.

   Sequence Number (32-bit): As defined in [RFC5357].

   Transmit Counter (64-bit): The number of packets or octets sent by
   the sender node in the query message and by the reflector node in the
   response message.  The counter is always written at the well-known
   location in the probe query and response messages.

   Receive Counter (64-bit): The number of packets or octets received at
   the reflector node.  It is written by the reflector node in the probe
   response message.

   Sender Counter (64-bit): This is the exact copy of the transmit
   counter from the received query message.  It is written by the
   reflector node in the probe response message.

   Sender Sequence Number (32-bit): As defined in [RFC5357].

   Sender TTL: As defined in Section 7.1.

   LM Flags: The meanings of the Flag bits are:

      X: Extended counter format indicator.  Indicates the use of
      extended (64-bit) counter values.  Initialized to 1 upon creation
      (and prior to transmission) of an LM Query and copied from an LM
      Query to an LM response.  Set to 0 when the LM message is
      transmitted or received over an interface that writes 32-bit
      counter values.

      B: Octet (byte) count.  When set to 1, indicates that the Counter
      1-4 fields represent octet counts.  The octet count applies to all
      packets within the LM scope, and the octet count of a packet sent
      or received includes the total length of that packet (but excludes
      headers, labels, or framing of the channel itself).  When set to
      0, indicates that the Counter fields represent packet counts.

   Block Number (8-bit): The Loss Measurement using Alternate-Marking
   method defined in [RFC8321] requires to color the data traffic.  To
   be able to compare the transmit and receive traffic counters of the
   matching color, the Block Number (or color) of the traffic counters
   is carried by the probe query and response messages for loss
   measurement.

   HMAC: The PM probe message in authenticated mode includes a key
   Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC) ([RFC2104]) hash.  Each
   probe query and response messages are authenticated by adding
   Sequence Number with Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC) TLV.
   It can use HMAC-SHA-256 truncated to 128 bits (similarly to the use
   of it in IPSec defined in [RFC4868]); hence the length of the HMAC
   field is 16 octets.

   HMAC uses its own key and the mechanism to distribute the HMAC key is
   outside the scope of this document.

   In authenticated mode, only the sequence number is encrypted, and the
   other payload fields are sent in clear text.  The probe message may
   include Comp.MBZ (Must Be Zero) variable length field to align the
   packet on 16 octets boundary.

4.2.  Probe Response Message

   The probe response message is sent using the IP/UDP information from
   the received probe query message.  The content of the probe response
   message is shown in Figure 9.

                     Figure 9: Probe Response Message

4.2.1.  One-way Measurement Mode

   In one-way performance measurement mode, the probe response message
   as defined in Figure 9 is sent back out-of-band to the sender node,
   for both Links and SR Policies.  The Sender Control Code is set to
   "Out-of-band Response Requested".  In this delay measurement mode, as
   per Reference Topology, all timestamps t1, t2, t3, and t4 are
   collected by the probes.  However, only timestamps t1 and t2 are
   needed to measure one-way delay.

4.2.2.  Two-way Measurement Mode

   In two-way performance measurement mode, when using a bidirectional
   path, the probe response message as defined in Figure 9 is sent back
   to the sender node on the congruent path of the data traffic on the
   same reverse direction Link or associated reverse SR Policy
   [I-D.ietf-pce-sr-bidir-path].  The Sender Control Code is set to "In-
   band Response Requested".  In this delay measurement mode, as per
   Reference Topology, all timestamps t1, t2, t3, and t4 are collected
   by the probes.  All four timestamps are needed to measure two-way
   delay.

   Specifically, the probe response message is sent back on the incoming
   physical interface where the probe query message is received.  This
   is useful for example, in case of two-way measurement mode for Link
   delay.

4.2.3.  Loopback Measurement Mode

   The Loopback measurement mode can be used to measure round-trip delay
   for a bidirectional SR Path.  The IP header of the probe query
   message contains the destination address equals to the sender address
   and the source address equals to the reflector address.  Optionally,
   the probe query message can carry the reverse path information (e.g.
   reverse path label stack for SR-MPLS) as part of the SR header.  The
   probe messages are not punted at the reflector node and it does not
   process them and generate response messages.  The Sender Control Code
   is set to the default value of 0.  In this mode, as the probe packet
   is not punted on the reflector node for processing, the querier
   copies the 'Sequence Number' in 'Session-Sender Sequence Number'
   directly.  In this delay measurement mode, as per Reference Topology,
   the timestamps t1 and t4 are collected by the probes.  Both these
   timestamps are needed to measure round-trip delay.

4.2.4.  Loss Measurement Response Message Formats for TWAMP Light

   In this document, TWAMP Light probe response message formats are
   defined for loss measurement as shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13.

   document for Point-to-Point (P2P) SR Policies
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] are also equally applicable
   to the Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) SR Policies as following:

   o  The sender root node sends probe query messages using the
      Replication Segment defined in
      [I-D.voyer-spring-sr-replication-segment] for the P2MP SR Policy
      as shown in Figure 14.

   o  Each reflector leaf node sends its IP address in the Source
      Address of the probe response messages as shown in Figure 9.  This

6.  ECMP Support for SR Policies

   An SR Policy can have ECMPs between the source and transit nodes,
   between transit nodes and between transit and destination nodes.
   Usage of Anycast SID [RFC8402] by an SR Policy can result in ECMP
   paths via transit nodes part of that Anycast group.  The PM probe
   messages need to be sent to traverse different ECMP paths to measure
   performance delay of an SR Policy.

   Forwarding plane has various hashing functions available to forward
   packets on specific ECMP paths.  The mechanisms described in
   [RFC8029] and [RFC5884] for handling ECMPs are also applicable to the
   performance measurement.  In the IP header of the PM probe messages,
   sweeping of Destination Addresses in 127/8 range for IPv4 or
   0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:7F00/104 range for IPv6 can be used to exercise
   particular ECMP paths.  As specified in [RFC6437], Flow Label field
   in the outer IPv6 header can also be used for sweeping.

   The considerations for performance loss measurement for different
   ECMP paths of an SR Policy are outside the scope of this document.

7.  Additional Message Processing Rules

   The processing rules defined in this section are applicable to TWAMP
   Light messages for delay and loss measurement for Links and end-to-
   end SR Policies.

Internet-Draft       TWAMP Light for Segment Routing          March 2020


7.1.  TTL and Hop Limit

   The TTL field in the IPv4 and MPLS headers of the probe query
   messages is set to 255 [RFC5357].  Similarly, the Hop Limit field in
   the IPv6 and SRH headers of the probe query messages is set to 255
   [RFC5357].

   When using the Destination IPv4 Address from the 127/8 range, the TTL
   in the IPv4 header is set to 1 [RFC8029].  Similarly, when using the
   Destination IPv6 Address from the 0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:7F00/104 range, the
   Hop Limit field in the inner IPv6 header is set to 1 whereas in the
   outer IPv6 header is set to 255.

   For Link performance delay and loss measurements, the TTL and Hop
   Limit field in the probe message is set to 1 in both one-way and two-
   way measurement modes.

7.2.  Router Alert Option

   The Router Alert IP option is not set when using the routable
   Destination IP Address in the probe messages.

   When using the Destination IPv4 Address from the 127/8 range, to be
   able to punt probe packets on the reflector node, the Router Alert IP
   Option of value 0x0 [RFC2113] for IPv4 may be added [RFC8029].
   Similarly, when using the Destination IPv6 Address from the
   0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:7F00/104 range, the Router Alert IP Option of value 69
   [RFC7506] for IPv6 may be added in the destination option header,
   Section 4.6 of [RFC8200].  For SRv6 Policy using SRH, it is added in
   the inner IPv6 header.

7.3.  UDP Checksum

   The UDP Checksum Complement for delay and loss measurement messages
   follows the procedure defined in [RFC7820] and can be optionally used
   with the procedures defined in this document.

   For IPv4 and IPv6 probe messages, where the hardware is not capable
   of re-computing the UDP checksum or adding checksum complement
   [RFC7820], the sender node sets the UDP checksum to 0 [RFC6936]
   [RFC8085].  The receiving node bypasses the checksum validation and
   accepts the packets with UDP checksum value 0 for the UDP port being
   used for PM delay and loss measurements.

8.  Security Considerations

   The performance measurement is intended for deployment in well-
   managed private and service provider networks.  As such, it assumes
   that a node involved in a measurement operation has previously
   verified the integrity of the path and the identity of the far-end
   reflector node.

   If desired, attacks can be mitigated by performing basic validation
   and sanity checks, at the sender, of the counter or timestamp fields
   in received measurement response messages.  The minimal state
   associated with these protocols also limits the extent of measurement
   disruption that can be caused by a corrupt or invalid message to a
   single query/response cycle.

   Use of HMAC-SHA-256 in the authenticated mode protects the data
   integrity of the probe messages.  SRv6 has HMAC protection
   authentication defined for SRH [RFC8754].  Hence, PM probe messages
   for SRv6 may not need authentication mode.  Cryptographic measures
   may be enhanced by the correct configuration of access-control lists
   and firewalls.

   This document does not require any IANA action.
