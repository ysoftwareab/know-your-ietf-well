                  A YANG Data Model for Routing Policy
                    draft-ietf-rtgwg-policy-model-31

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG data model for configuring and managing
   routing policies in a vendor-neutral way.  The model provides a
   generic routing policy framework which can be extended for specific
   routing protocols using the YANG 'augment' mechanism.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes a YANG [RFC7950] data model for routing
   policy configuration based on operational usage and best practices in
   a variety of service provider networks.  The model is intended to be
   vendor-neutral, to allow operators to manage policy configuration
   consistently in environments with routers supplied by multiple
   vendors.

   The YANG modules in this document conform to the Network Management
   Datastore Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342].

Internet-Draft            Routing Policy Model               August 2021


1.1.  Goals and approach

   This model does not aim to be feature complete -- it is a subset of
   the policy configuration parameters available in a variety of vendor
   implementations, but supports widely used constructs for managing how
   routes are imported, exported, and modified across different routing
   protocols.  The model development approach has been to examine actual
   policy configurations in use across several operator networks.
   Hence, the focus is on enabling policy configuration capabilities and
   structure that are in wide use.

   Despite the differences in details of policy expressions and
   conventions in various vendor implementations, the model reflects the
   observation that a relatively simple condition-action approach can be
   readily mapped to several existing vendor implementations, and also
   gives operators a familiar and straightforward way to express policy.
   A side effect of this design decision is that other methods for
   expressing policies are not considered.

   Consistent with the goal to produce a data model that is vendor
   neutral, only policy expressions that are deemed to be widely
   available in existing major implementations are included in the
   model.  Those configuration items that are only available from a
   single implementation are omitted from the model with the expectation
   they will be available in separate vendor-provided modules that
   augment the current model.

2.  Terminology and Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Routing policy: A routing policy defines how routes are imported,
   exported, modified, and advertised between routing protocol instances
   or within a single routing protocol instance.

   Policy chain: A policy chain is a sequence of policy definitions.
   They can be referenced from different contexts.

   Policy statement: Policy statements consist of a set of conditions
   and actions (either of which may be empty).

   The following terms are defined in [RFC8342]:

   o  client

   Tree diagrams used in this document follow the notation defined in
   [RFC8340].

2.2.  Prefixes in Data Node Names

   In this document, names of data nodes, actions, and other data model
   objects are often used without a prefix, as long as it is clear from
   the context in which YANG module each name is defined.  Otherwise,

   names are prefixed using the standard prefix associated with the
   corresponding YANG module, as shown in Table 1.

3.  Model overview

   The routing policy module has three main parts:

   o  A generic framework is provided to express policies as sets of
      related conditions and actions.  This includes match sets and
      actions that are useful across many routing protocols.

   o  A structure that allows routing protocol models to add protocol-
      specific policy conditions and actions though YANG augmentations
      is also provided.  There is a complete example of this for BGP
      [RFC4271] policies in the proposed vendor-neutral BGP data model
      [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-model].  Appendix A provides an example of how
      an augmentation for BGP policies might be accomplished.  Note that
      this section is not normative as the BGP model is still evolving.

   o  Finally, a reusable grouping is defined for attaching import and
      export rules in the context of routing configuration for different
      protocols, VRFs, etc.  This also enables creation of policy chains
      and expressing default policy behavior.  In this document, policy
      chains are sequences of policy definitions that are applied in
      order (described in Section 4).

   The module makes use of the standard Internet types, such as IP
   addresses, autonomous system numbers, etc., defined in RFC 6991
   [RFC6991].

4.  Route policy expression

   Policies are expressed as a sequence of top-level policy definitions
   each of which consists of a sequence of policy statements.  Policy
   statements in turn consist of simple condition-action tuples.
   Conditions may include multiple match or comparison operations, and
   similarly, actions may include multiple changes to route attributes,
   or indicate a final disposition of accepting or rejecting the route.
   This structure is shown below.

      +--rw routing-policy
         +--ro match-modified-attributes?   boolean
         +--rw policy-definitions
            +--rw policy-definition* [name]
               +--rw name          string
               +--rw statements
                  +--rw statement* [name]
                     +--rw name          string
                     +--rw conditions
                     |     ...
                     +--rw actions
                           ...

4.1.  Defined sets for policy matching

   The model provides a collection of generic sets that can be used for
   matching in policy conditions.  These sets are applicable for route
   selection across multiple routing protocols.  They may be further
   augmented by protocol-specific models which have their own defined
   sets.  The defined sets include:

   o  prefix sets - Each prefix set defines a set of IP prefixes, each
      with an associated IP prefix and netmask range (or exact length).

   o  neighbor sets - Each neighbor set defines a set of neighboring
      nodes by their IP addresses.  A neighbor set is used for selecting
      routes based on the neighbors advertising the routes.

   o  tag set - Each tag set defines a set of generic tag values that
      can be used in matches for filtering routes.

   The model structure for defined sets is shown below.

          |        +--rw tag-value*   tag-type


4.2.  Policy conditions

   Policy statements consist of a set of conditions and actions (either
   of which may be empty).  Conditions are used to match route
   attributes against a defined set (e.g., a prefix set), or to compare
   attributes against a specific value.  The default action is to
   reject-route.

   Match conditions may be further modified using the match-set-options
   configuration which allows network operators to change the behavior
   of a match.  Three options are supported:

   o  ALL - match is true only if the given value matches all members of
      the set.

   o  ANY - match is true if the given value matches any member of the
      set.

   o  INVERT - match is true if the given value does not match any
      member of the given set.

   Not all options are appropriate for matching against all defined sets
   (e.g., match ALL in a prefix set does not make sense).  In the model,
   a restricted set of match options is used where applicable.

Internet-Draft            Routing Policy Model               August 2021


   Comparison conditions may similarly use options to change how route
   attributes should be tested, e.g., for equality or inequality,
   against a given value.

   While most policy conditions will be added by individual routing
   protocol models via augmentation, this routing policy model includes
   several generic match conditions and the ability to test which
   protocol or mechanism installed a route (e.g., BGP, IGP, static,
   etc.).  The conditions included in the model are shown below.

                  |  +--rw match-neighbor-set
                  |  |  +--rw neighbor-set?
                  |  +--rw match-tag-set
                  |  |  +--rw tag-set?
                  |  |  +--rw match-set-options?
                  |  +--rw match-route-type*   identityref
                  |     +--rw route-type*


4.3.  Policy actions

   When policy conditions are satisfied, policy actions are used to set
   various attributes of the route being processed, or to indicate the
   final disposition of the route, i.e., accept or reject.

   Similar to policy conditions, the routing policy model includes
   generic actions in addition to the basic route disposition actions.
   These are shown below.

                       +--rw set-application-tag?   tag-type

4.4.  Policy subroutines

   Policy 'subroutines' (or nested policies) are supported by allowing
   policy statement conditions to reference other policy definitions
   using the call-policy configuration.  Called policies apply their
   conditions and actions before returning to the calling policy
   statement and resuming evaluation.  The outcome of the called policy
   affects the evaluation of the calling policy.  If the called policy
   results in an accept-route, then the subroutine returns an effective
   Boolean true value to the calling policy.  For the calling policy,
   this is equivalent to a condition statement evaluating to a true
   value and evaluation of the policy continues (see Section 5).  Note
   that the called policy may also modify attributes of the route in its
   action statements.  Similarly, a reject-route action returns false
   and the calling policy evaluation will be affected accordingly.  When
   the end of the subroutine policy statements is reached, the default
   route disposition action is returned (i.e., Boolean false for reject-
   route).  Consequently, a subroutine cannot explicitly accept or
   reject a route.  Rather, the called policy returns Boolean true if
   its outcome is accept-route or Boolean false if its outcome is
   reject-route.  Route acceptance or rejection is solely determined by
   the top-level policy.

   Note that the called policy may itself call other policies (subject
   to implementation limitations).  The model does not prescribe a
   nesting depth because this varies among implementations.  For
   example, an implementation may only support a single level of
   subroutine recursion.  As with any routing policy construction, care
   must be taken with nested policies to ensure that the effective

Internet-Draft            Routing Policy Model               August 2021


   return value results in the intended behavior.  Nested policies are a
   convenience in many routing policy constructions but creating
   policies nested beyond a small number of levels (e.g., 2-3) is
   discouraged.  Also, implementations MUST validate to ensure that
   there is no recursion among nested routing policies.

5.  Policy evaluation

   Evaluation of each policy definition proceeds by evaluating its
   individual policy statements in order that they are defined.  When
   all the condition statements in a policy statement are satisfied, the
   corresponding action statements are executed.  If the actions include
   either accept-route or reject-route actions, evaluation of the
   current policy definition stops, and no further policy statement is
   evaluated.  If there are multiple policies in the policy chain,
   subsequent policies are not evaluated.  Policy chains are sequences
   of policy definitions (as described in Section 4).

   If the conditions are not satisfied, then evaluation proceeds to the
   next policy statement.  If none of the policy statement conditions
   are satisfied, then evaluation of the current policy definition
   stops, and the next policy definition in the chain is evaluated.
   When the end of the policy chain is reached, the default route
   disposition action is performed (i.e., reject-route unless an
   alternate default action is specified for the chain).

   Whether the route's pre-policy attributes are used for testing policy
   statement conditions is dependent on the implementation specific
   value of the match-modified-attributes leaf.  If match-modified-
   attributes is false and actions modify route attributes, these
   modifications are not used for policy statement conditions.
   Conversely, if match-modified-attributes is true and actions modify
   the policy application-specific attributes, the attributes as
   modified by the policy are used for policy condition statements.

6.  Applying routing policy

   Routing policy is applied by defining and attaching policy chains in
   various routing contexts.  Policy chains are sequences of policy
   definitions (described in Section 4).  They can be referenced from
   different contexts.  For example, a policy chain could be associated
   with a routing protocol and used to control its interaction with its
   protocol peers.  Or it could be used to control the interaction
   between a routing protocol and the local routing information base.  A
   policy chain has an associated direction (import or export), with
   respect to the context in which it is referenced.

   The routing policy model defines an apply-policy grouping that can be
   imported and used by other models.  As shown below, it allows
   definition of import and export policy chains, as well as specifying
   the default route disposition to be used when no policy definition in
   the chain results in a final decision.

         +--rw apply-policy
         |  +--rw import-policy*
         |  +--rw default-import-policy?   default-policy-type
         |  +--rw export-policy*
         |  +--rw default-export-policy?   default-policy-type

   The default policy defined by the model is to reject the route for
   both import and export policies.

8.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341] provides the means
   to restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a pre-
   configured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      /routing-policy/defined-sets/prefix-sets -- Modification to
      prefix-sets could result in a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.  An
      attacker may try to modify prefix-sets and redirect or drop
      traffic.  Redirection of traffic could be used as part of a more
      elaborate attack to either collect sensitive information or
      masquerade a service.  Additionally, a control-plane DoS attack
      could be accomplished by allowing a large number of routes to be
      leaked into a routing protocol domain (e.g., BGP).

      /routing-policy/defined-sets/neighbor-sets -- Modification to the
      neighbor-sets could be used to mount a DoS attack or more
      elaborate attack as with prefix-sets.  For example, a DoS attack
      could be mounted by changing the neighbor-set from which routes
      are accepted.

      /routing-policy/defined-sets/tag-sets -- Modification to the tag-
      sets could be used to mount a DoS attack.  Routes with certain
      tags might be redirected or dropped.  The implications are similar
      to prefix-sets and neighbor-sets.  However, the attack may be more
      difficult to detect as the routing policy usage of route tags and

      intent must be understood to recognize the breach.  Conversely,
      the implications of prefix-set or neighbor set modification are
      easier to recognize.

      /routing-policy/policy-definitions/policy-definition
      /statements/statement/conditions -- Modification to the conditions
      could be used to mount a DoS attack or other attack.  An attacker
      may change a policy condition and redirect or drop traffic.  As
      with prefix-sets, neighbor-sets, or tag-sets, traffic redirection
      could be used as part of a more elaborate attack.

      /routing-policy/policy-definitions/policy-definition
      /statements/statement/actions -- Modification to actions could be
      used to mount a DoS attack or other attack.  Traffic may be
      redirected or dropped.  As with prefix-sets, neighbor-sets, or
      tag-sets, traffic redirection could be used as part of a more
      elaborate attack.  Additionally, route attributes may be changed
      to mount a second-level attack that is more difficult to detect.

   Some of the readable data nodes in the YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      /routing-policy/defined-sets/prefix-sets -- Knowledge of these
      data nodes can be used to ascertain which local prefixes are
      susceptible to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.

      /routing-policy/defined-sets/prefix-sets -- Knowledge of these
      data nodes can be used to ascertain local neighbors against whom
      to mount a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.

      /routing-policy/policy-definitions/policy-definition /statements/
      -- Knowledge of these data nodes can be used to attack the local
      router with a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.  Additionally,
      policies and their attendant conditions and actions should be
      considered proprietary and disclosure could be used to ascertain
      partners, customers, and supplies.  Furthermore, the policies
      themselves could represent intellectual property and disclosure
      could diminish their corresponding business advantage.

   Routing policy configuration has a significant impact on network
   operations, and, as such, other YANG models that reference routing
   policies are also susceptible to vulnerabilities relating the YANG
   data nodes specified above.

Appendix A.  Routing protocol-specific policies

   Routing models that require the ability to apply routing policy may
   augment the routing policy model with protocol or other specific
   policy configuration.  The routing policy model assumes that
   additional defined sets, conditions, and actions may all be added by
   other models.

   The example below provides an illustration of how another data model
   can augment parts of this routing policy data model.  It uses

Appendix B.  Policy examples

   Below we show examples of XML-encoded configuration data using the
   routing policy and BGP models to illustrate both how policies are
   defined, and how they can be applied.  Note that the XML has been
   simplified for readability.

   The following example shows how prefix-set and tag-set can be
   defined.  The policy condition is to match a prefix-set and a tag-
   set, and the action is to accept routes that match the condition.

     <config xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">

   In the following example, all routes in the RIB that have been
   learned from OSPF advertisements corresponding to OSPF intra-area and
   inter-area route types should get advertised into ISIS level-2
   advertisements.
