             Evaluation of Privacy for DNS Private Exchange
                        draft-am-dprive-eval-01

Abstract

   The set of DNS requests that an individual makes can provide a
   monitor with a large amount of information about that individual.
   DNS Private Exchange (DPRIVE) aims to deprive this actor of this
   information.  This document describes methods for measuring the
   performance of DNS privacy mechanisms, particularly it provides
   methods for measuring effectiveness in the face of pervasive
   monitoring as defined in RFC7258.  The document includes example
   evaluations for common use cases.

1.  Motivation

   One of the IETF's core views is that protocols should be designed to
   enable security and privacy while online [RFC3552].  In light of the
   recent reported pervasive monitoring efforts, another goal is to
   design protocols and mechanisms to make such monitoring expensive or
   infeasible to conduct.  As detailed in the DPRIVE problem statement
   [dprive-problem], DNS resolution is an important arena for pervasive
   monitoring, and in some cases may be used for breaching the privacy
   of individuals.  The set of DNS requests that an individual makes can
   provide a large amount of information about that individual.  Not
   only individual requesters reveal information with their sets of DNS
   queries.  In some specific use cases, the sets of DNS requests from a
   DNS recursive resolver or other entity may also provide revealing
   information.  This document describes methods for measuring the
   performance of DNS privacy mechanisms; in particular, it provides
   methods for measuring effectiveness in the face of pervasive
   monitoring as defined in [RFC7258].  The document includes example
   evaluations for common use cases.

   The privacy risks associated with DNS monitoring are not new, however
   they were brought into a greater visibility by the issue described in
   [RFC7258].  The DPRIVE working group was formed to respond and at
   this time has several DNS private exchange mechanisms in
   consideration, including [dns-over-tls], [confidential-dns],
   [phb-dnse], and [privatedns].  There is also related work in other
   working groups, including DNSOP: [qname-minimisation] and
   (potentially) DANE [ipseca].  The recently published [RFC7435] also
   has relevance to DNS private exchange.

   Each effort related to DNS privacy mechanisms asserts some privacy
   assurances and operational relevance.  Metrics for these privacy
   assurances are needed and are in reach based on existing techniques
   from the general field of privacy engineering.  Systematic evaluation
   of DNS privacy mechanisms will enhance the likely operational
   effectiveness of DNS private exchange.

   Evaluating an individual mechanism for DNS privacy could be
   accomplished on a one-off basis, presumably as Privacy Considerations
   within each specification, but this will not address as much
   variation of operational contexts nor will it cover using multiple
   mechanisms together (in composition).  Section 2 of [RFC6973]
   discussed both benefits and risks of using multiple mechanisms.

   Definitions required for evaluating the privacy of stand-alone and
   composed design are not limited to privacy notions, but also need to
   include the risk model and some information about relationships among
   the entities in a given system.  A mechanism for providing privacy to
   withstand the power and capabilities of a passive pervasive monitor
   may not withstand a more powerful actor using active monitoring by
   plugging itself into the path of individuals' DNS requests as a
   forwarder .  Having some standard models, and understanding how
   applicable they are to various designs is a part of evaluating the
   privacy.

   Sections 2 and 3 present privacy terminology and some assumptions.
   Sections 4 and 5 cover the system model or setup and the risk models
   of interest.  In Section 6, we review a list of DNS privacy
   mechanisms, including some which are not in scope of the DPRIVE
   working group.  Section 7 tackles how to evaluate privacy mechanisms,
   in the form of templates and outcomes.  Given a specific risk model,
   the guarantees with respect to privacy of an individual or an item of
   interest are quantified.

2.  Privacy Evaluation Definitions

   This section provides definitions to be used for privacy evaluation
   of DNS.  [RFC6973] is the verbatim source of most of the definitions.
   Text is added to apply them to the DNS case.  We follow the [RFC6973]
   in classifying the terms.  We have added a new section of terms to
   include several important practical or conventional terms that were
   not included in [RFC6973] such as PII.  For the terms from [RFC6973],
   we include their definitions rather than simply referencing them as
   an aid to readability.

2.1.  Entities

   o  Attacker: An entity that works against one or more privacy
      protection goals.  Unlike observers, attackers' behavior is
      unauthorized, in a way similar to that of an eavesdropper.

   o  Eavesdropper: A type of attacker that passively observes an
      initiator's communications without the initiator's knowledge or
      authorization.  This may include a passive pervasive monitor,
      defined below.

   o  Enabler: A protocol entity that facilitates communication between
      an initiator and a recipient without being directly in the
      communications path.  DNS examples of an enabler in this sense
      include a recursive resolver, a proxy, or a forwarder.

   o  Individual: A human being (or a group of them)

   o  Initiator: A protocol entity that initiates communications with a
      recipient.

   o  Intermediary: A protocol entity that sits between the initiator
      (stub resolver) and the recipient (recursive resolver or authority
      resolver) and is necessary for the initiator and recipient to
      communicate.  Unlike an eavesdropper, an intermediary is an entity
      that is part of the communication architecture and therefore at
      least tacitly authorized.

   o  Observer: An entity that is able to observe and collect
      information from communications, potentially posing privacy risks,
      depending on the context.  As defined in this document,
      initiators, recipients, intermediaries, and enablers can all be
      observers.  Observers are distinguished from eavesdroppers by
      being at least tacitly authorized.

   o  We note that while the definition of an observer may include an
      initiator in the risk model, an initiator of a request is excluded



Mohaisen & Mankin        Expires January 7, 2016                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft        Evaluation of Privacy for DNS            July 2015


      in the context of this document, because it corresponds to the
      subject of interest being studied.  Similar to the definition in
      [RFC7258], we note that an attacker is broader than an observer.
      While [RFC7258] claim that an attack does not consider the motive
      of the actor, the given context of DNS implies a motive if the
      term attacker is used to characterize the risk.

2.2.  Data and Analysis

   We assume the following definitions related to data and analysis from
   [RFC4949]: attacker, correlation, fingerprint, fingerprinting, item
   of interest (IOI), personal data, interaction, traffic analysis,
   undetectability, and unlinkability.  We augment some of those
   definitions later in this document.

   from [RFC4949], we relax the definition of IOI to exclude "the fact
   that a communication interaction has taken place" as this does not
   suite the evaluated context of DNS.

2.3.  Identifiability

   We assume the following definitions related to identifiability from
   [RFC4949]: anonymity, anonymity set, anonymous, attribute, identity
   provider, personal name, and relying party.

   The following definitions are modified for the context of this
   document from those defined in [RFC4949]

   o  Identifiability: The extent to which an individual is
      identifiable.  [RFC6973] has the rest of the variations on this
      (Identifiable, Identification, Identified, Identifier, Identity,
      Identity Confidentiality)

   o  Personal Name: A natural name for an individual.  Personal names
      are often not unique and often comprise given names in combination
      with a family name.  An individual may have multiple personal
      names at any time and over a lifetime, including official names.
      From a technological perspective, it cannot always be determined
      whether a given reference to an individual is, or is based upon,
      the individual's personal name(s) (see Pseudonym).  NOTE: The
      reason to import this definition is that some query names that
      cause privacy leakage do so by embedding personal names as
      identifiers of host or other equipment, e.g.
      AllisonMankinMac.example.com.

   o  Pseudonymity: See the formal definition in the next section in
      lieu of [RFC6973].

Internet-Draft        Evaluation of Privacy for DNS            July 2015


   NOTE: Identifiability Definitions in [RFC6973] also include some
   material not included here because the distinctions are not major for
   DNS Private Exchange, such as real and official names, and variant
   forms of Pseudonymity in its informal definition.

2.4.  Other Central Definitions and Formalizations

   Central to the presentation of this document is the definition of
   personally identifiable information (PII), as well as other
   definitions that supplement the definitions listed earlier or modify
   them for the context of this document.  In this section, we outline
   such definitions we further notes on their indications.

   o  Personally Identifiable Information (PII): Information
      (attributes) that can be used as is, or along with other side
      information, to identify, locate, and/or contact a single
      individual or subject (c.f. item of interest).

   NOTE: the definition above indicates that PII can be used on its own
   or in context.  In DNS privacy, the items without additional context
   include IP(v4 or v6) address, qname, qtype, timings of queries, etc.
   The additional context includes organization-level attributes, such
   as a network prefix that can be associated with an organization.  The
   definition of PII is complementary to the definition of items of
   interest.

   o  Subject: This term is useful as a parallel term to Individual.
      When the privacy of a group or an organization is of interest, we
      can reference the group or organization as Subject rather than
      Individual.

   Often it is desirable to reference alternative identifiers known as
   pseudonyms.  A pseudonym is a name assumed by an individual in some
   context, unrelated to the names or identifiers known by others in
   that context.

   o  Pseudonymity/Pseudonym: a relaxation of the definition of
      anonymity for usability.  In particular, pseudonymity is an
      anonymity feature obtained by using a pseudonym, an identifier
      that is used for establishing a long relationship between two
      entities.

   As an example, in the DNS context, a randomly generated pseudonym
   might identify a set of query data with a shared context, such as
   geographic origin.  Such pseudonymity enables another entity
   interested in breaching the privacy to link multiple queries on a
   long-term basis.  Pseudonyms are assumed long-lived and their

Internet-Draft        Evaluation of Privacy for DNS            July 2015


   uniqueness may be a goal.  There are many findings that indicate that
   pseudonymity is weaker than anonymity.

   o  Unlinkability: Formally, two items of interest are said to be
      unlinkable if the certainty of an actor concerning those items of
      interest is not affected by observing the system.  This is,
      unlinkability implies that the a-posteriori probability computed a
      monitor that two items of interest are related is close enough to
      the a-priori probability computed by a monitor based on his
      knowledge.

   Two items of interest are said to be unlinkable if there is a small
   (beta, close to 0) probability that the monitor identifies them as
   associated, and they are linkable if there is a sufficiently large
   probability (referred to as alpha).

   Informally, given two items of interest (user attributes, DNS
   queries, users, etc.), unlinkability is defined as the inability of
   the monitor to sufficiently determine whether those items are related
   to one another.  In the context of DNS, this refers typically but not
   only to a monitor relating queries to the same individual.

   o  Undetectability: a stronger definition of privacy, where an item
      of interest is said to be undetectable if the monitor is not
      sufficiently able to know or tell whether the item exists or not.

   Note that undetectability implies unlinkability.  As explained below,
   a way of ensuring undetectability is to use encryption secure under
   known ciphertext attacks, or randomized encryption.

   o  Unobservability: a stronger definition of privacy that requires
      satisfying both undetectability and anonymity.  Unobservability
      means that an item of interest is undetectable by any uninvolved
      individual, monitor or not.

   In theory, there are many ways of ensuring unobservability by
   fulfilling both requirements.  For example, undetectability requires
   that no party uninvolved in the resolution of a DNS query shall know
   that query has existed or not.  A mechanism to ensure this function
   is encryption secure under known ciphertext attacks, or randomized
   encryption for all other than stub, and pseudonyms for the stub
   resolver.  An alternative mechanism to provide the anonymity property
   would be the use of mix networks for routing DNS queries.

3.  Assumptions about Quantification of Privacy

   The quantification of privacy is connected with the privacy goals.
   Is the desired privacy property unlinkability only, or is it
   undetectability.  Is pseudonymity a sufficient property?  Parameters
   and entire privacy mechanism choices are affected by the choice of
   privacy goals.

   While a binary measure of privacy is sometimes possible, that is,
   being able to say that the transaction is anonymous, in this
   document, we assume that the binary is not frequently obtainable, and
   therefore we focus on methods for continuous quantification.  Both
   are relevant to DNS Private Exchange.  Another way to state this is
   that the quantification could be exactly the probabilities 1 and 0,
   corresponding to the binary, but the methods prefer to provide
   continuous values instead.

   Here is an example of continuous quantification, related to
   identifiability of an individual or item of interest based on
   observing queries.

   o  For an individual A, and a set of observations by a monitor, Y =
      [y1, y2, ... yn], we define the privacy of A as the uncertainty of
      the monitor of knowing that A is itself among many others under
      the observations Y; that is, we define Privacy = 1 - P[A | Y]

   o  For an item of interest r associated with a user A, we similarly
      define the privacy of r as Privacy = 1 - P[r | Y].

4.  System Model

   A DNS client (a DNS stub resolver) may resolve a domain name or
   address into the corresponding DNS record by contacting the
   authoritative name server responsible for that domain name (or
   address) directly.  However, to improve the operation of DNS
   resolution, and reduce the round trip time required for resolving an
   address, both caching and recursive resolution are implemented.
   Caching is implemented at an intermediary between the stub and the
   authoritative name server.  In practice, many caching servers also
   implement the recursive logic of DNS resolution for finding the name
   server authoritative for a domain, and are thus named DNS recursive
   resolvers.  Another type of entity, forwarders (or proxies) are
   intermediaries between the three named here.  The system model for
   DNS privacy evaluation includes the four entities quickly sketched
   here: stub resolvers, recursive resolvers, authoritative name
   servers, and forwarders.

4.1.  DNS Resolvers (System Model)

   o  Stub resolver (S): a minimal resolver that does not support
      referral, and delegates recursive resolution to a recursive
      resolver.  A stub resolver is a consumer of recursive resolutions.
      Per the terminology of [RFC6973], a stub resolver is an Initiator.

   o  Recursive resolver (R): a resolver that implements the recursive
      function of DNS resolution on behalf of a stub resolver.  Per the
      terminology of [RFC6973], a recursive resolver is an Enabler.

   o  Authoritative resolver (A): is a server that is the origin of a
      DNS record.  A recursive resolver queries the authoritative
      resolver to resolve a domain name or address.  Per the terminology
      of [RFC6973], the authoritative name server is also an Enabler.

   o  Forwarder/proxy (P): between the stub resolver and the
      authoritative resolver there may be more than one DNS-involved
      entity.  These are systems located between S and R (stub resolver
      and recursive), or between R and A (recursive and authoritative),
      which do not play a primary role in the DNS protocol.  Per the
      terminology of [RFC6973], forwarders are Intermediaries.

4.2.  System Setup - Putting It Together

   Evaluating various privacy protection mechanisms in relation to
   monitors such as the pervasive monitors defined next requires
   understanding links in the System setup.  We define the following
   links.  In relation to [RFC7258] these are the attack surface where a
   monitor (eavesdropper) collects sets of query information.

   o  Stub -> Recursive (S-R): a link between the stub resolver and a
      recursive resolver.  At the time of writing, the scope of DPRIVE
      Working Group privacy mechanisms is supposed to be limited to S-R.

   o  Stub -> Proxy (S-P): a link between the stub resolver and a
      forwarder/ proxy.  The intended function of this link may be
      difficult to analyze.

   o  Proxy -> Recursive (P-R): a link between a proxy and a recursive
      server.

   o  Recursive -> Authoritative (R-A): a link between a recursive and
      an authoritative name server.  Although at the time of writing,
      R-A is not in the DPRIVE scope, we touch on it in evaluations.

   Rather than notating in system setup that an entity is compromised,
   this is covered in the monitor model in Section 6, which has system
   elements as parameters.

   In the System Setup, there is a possibility that S and R exist on a
   single machine.  The concept of the Unlucky Few relates S and R in
   this case.  A monitor can monitor R-A and find the query traffic of
   the initiator individual.  The same concept applies in the case where
   a recursive is serving a relatively small number of individuals.  The
   query traffic of a subject group or organization (c.f.  Subject in
   the definitions) is obtained by the monitor who monitors this
   system's R-A.

   Because R-A is not in the DPRIVE scope, it is for future work to
   examine the Unlucky Few circumstance fully.  The general system setup
   is that PII, the individual's private identifying information, is not
   sent on R-A and is not seen by authoritative name server.

   There could be one or more proxies between the stub resolver and a
   recursive.  From a functionality point of view they can all be
   consolidated into a single proxy without affecting the system view,
   however, the behavior of such proxies may affect the size and shape
   of the attack surface.  However, we believe that an additional
   treatment is needed for this case and it is not included in the
   discussion.

   We also do not include in discussion proxies that exist along R-A,
   between a recursive and an authoritative name server.  We do so in
   respect for the DPRIVE charter's scope at this time.  According to
   recent work at [openresolverproject.org], there may be multiple
   intermediaries with poorly defined behavior.

   The system setup here leaves out other realistic considerations for
   simplicity, such as the impact of shared caches in DNS entities.

5.  Risk Model

   The Definitions section defines observer, attack and monitor, but not
   a Risk Model, which is needed to actually evaluate privacy, so this
   is now defined.

   For consistency, we note that the only difference between an attacker
   and an obeserver is that an attacker is an unauthorized observer with
   all the capabilities it may has.  However, we also stress that for
   the context of DNS privacy, the term attacker may implicitly assume
   an intent.  To that end, active and passive observers are
   collectively referred to as actors.

   o  Risk Model: a well-defined set of capabilities indicating how much
      information an observer (or eavesdropper) has, and in what
      context, in order to reach a goal of breaching the privacy of an
      individual or subject with respect to a given privacy metric.

   In this document we focus on two risk models, namely a pervasive
   monitor and a malicious monitor.

5.1.  Risk Type-1 - Passive Pervasive Monitor

   This risk corresponds to the passive pervasive monitoring model
   described in [RFC7258].  This model relies on monitoring capabilities
   to breach the privacy of individuals from the DNS traffic at scale
   without decimation.  An actor causing this risk is capable of
   eavesdropping or observing traffic between two end points, including
   traffic between any of the pairs of the entities described in section
   2.1.  Per [RFC7258], this type of actor has abilities to eavesdrop
   pervasively on many links at once, which is a powerful form of
   attack.  Type-1 monitor are passive.  They do not modify traffic or
   insert traffic.

5.2.  Risk Type-2 - Active Monitor

   an actor with the same types of capabilities of monitoring links,
   which selects links in order to target specific individuals.  A
   Type-2 monitor for instance might put into place intermediaries in
   order to obtain traffic on specific links.

   Note that we exclude the malicious monitoring from this document
   since, by definition, a malicious actor has an intent associated with
   his actions.

5.3.  Risks in the System Setup

   To evaluate the privacy provided by a given mechanism or mechanisms
   in a particular system model, we characterize the risk with a
   template with parameters from the system model in which the risk
   actor (eavesdropper or observer as monitors) is located.  The general
   template is: Risk(Type, [Entities], [Links]).  For example, the
   template Risk(Type-2, R, S-R) passed as a parameter in the evaluation
   of a privacy mechanism indicates a Type-2 monitor that controls a
   recursive and has the capability of eavesdropping on the link between
   the stub and recursive resolvers.  Other risk templates include the
   appropriate parameterizations based on the above description of those
   monitors, including monitors that have the capabilities of monitoring
   multiple links and controlling multiple pieces of infrastructure.

6.  Privacy Mechanisms

   Various mechanisms for enhancing privacy in networks are applicable
   to DNS private exchange.  Some mechanisms common to privacy research
   include mixing networks, dummy traffic, and private information
   retrieval techniques.  Applicable protocol mechanisms include
   encryption-based techniques - encrypting the channel carrying the
   queries using IPSEC [ipseca], TLS [dns-over-tls] or special-purpose
   encryption [confidential-dns].  [privatedns] includes special-purpose
   encryption and also depends on a trusted service broker.

   o  Mixing Networks: in this type of mechanism, the initiator uses a
      mixing network such as Tor to route the DNS queries to the
      intended DNS server entity.  A monitor observing part of the
      system finds it difficult to determine which individual sends
      which queries, and will not be able to tell which individual has
      sent them (ideally, though it is known that attacks exist that
      allow correlation and privacy breaches against mixing networks).
      The privacy property is unlinkability of the queries; the
      probability that two queries coming from one exit node in the
      mixing network belong to the same individual is uniform among all
      the individuals using the network.

   o  Dummy Traffic: a simple mechanism in which the initiator of a DNS
      request will also generate k dummy queries and send the intended
      query along with those queries.  As such, the adversary will not
      be able to tell which query is of interest to the initiator.  For
      a given k, the probability that the adversary will be able to
      detect which query is interest to the initiator is equal to
      1-1/(k+1).  In that sense, and for the proper parameterization of
      the protocol, the monitor is bounded to the undetectability of the
      queries.

   o  Private Information Retrieval: a mechanism that allows a user s to
      retrieve a record r from a database DB on a server without
      allowing the server to learn r.  A trivial solution to the problem
      requires that s downloads the entire DB and then perform the
      queries locally.  While that provides privacy to the queries of
      the user, the solution is communication inefficient at the scale
      of the DNS.  More sophisticated cryptographic solutions are multi-
      round, and thus reduce the communication overhead, but are still
      inefficient for the DNS.

   o  Query Minimization: a mechanism that allows the resolver to
      minimize the amount of information it sends on behalf of a stub
      resolver.  A method of query minimization is specified in
      [qname-minimisation].  Qname minimization deprives a Type-1 risk

      on R-A of information from correlating queries, unless the
      individuals have an Unfortunate Few problem.

   o  NOTE: queries on R-A generally do not include an identifier of the
      individual making the query, because the source address is that of
      R.  With respect R or A themselves, they may have well established
      policies for respecting the sensitivity of queries they process,
      while still using summary analysis of those queries to improve
      security, stability or their business operation.

   o  Encrypted Channel Mechanisms: Using these mechanisms, an initiator
      has an encrypted channel with a corresponding enabler, so that the
      queries are not available to eavesdropping Pervasive Monitor risk.
      Examples include [dns-over-tls], [ipseca], and [confidential-dns].
      Depending on the characteristics of the channel, various privacy
      properties are ensured.  For instance, undetectability of queries
      is ensured for encryption-based mechanisms once the encrypted
      channel is established.  Unlinkability of the queries may depend
      on the type of crypto-suite; it is provided as long as randomized
      encryption is used.

   o  Composed (Multiple) Mechanisms: the use of multiple mechanisms is
      a likely scenario and results in varied privacy guarantees.
      Consider a hypothetical system in which mixing networks (for
      unlinkability) and randomized encryption (for undetectability) can
      both be applied, thus providing for unobservability, a stronger
      property than either of the two along.  On the other hand,
      consider another hypothetical system in which mixing networks are
      used to reach a third party broker requiring sign-in and
      authorization.  Depending on the risk type, this could mean that
      the mixing network unlinkability was cancelled out by the
      linkability due to entrusting the third party with identifying
      information in order to be authorized.

7.  Privacy Evaluation

   Now we turn our attention to the evaluation of privacy mechanisms in
   a standard form, given the risk models and system definitions, for
   some of the example mechanisms.

   An evaluation takes multiple parameters as input.  The output of the
   evaluation template is based on the analysis of the individual
   algorithms, settings, and parameters passed to this evaluation
   mechanism.

   Here is the top level interface of the evaluation template:





Mohaisen & Mankin        Expires January 7, 2016               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft        Evaluation of Privacy for DNS            July 2015


   Eval(Privacy_Mechanism(param_1, param_2, ...),
   System_Setting(param_1, param_2, ...), Risk_Model(param_1,
   param_2,...)

   The output of the function is a privacy guarantee for the given
   settings, expressed through defined properties such as unlinkability
   and unobservability, for the specified system and risk model.

   7.1 Dummy Traffic Example

   Eval(Dummy_Traffic (k=10, distribution=uniform), System_Setting([S,
   P, R, A], [S-P, P-R, R-A]), Risk_Model(Type-1A, S-R)).

   The dummy traffic mechanism is not presented as a practical
   mechanism, though there's no way to know if there are deployments of
   this type of mechanism.  This example evaluation uses k=10 to
   indicate that for every one query initiated by an individual, ten
   queries that disguise the query of interest are selected uniformly at
   random from a pool of queries.  In the parameters passed in the
   evaluation function, we indicate that the privacy assurances of
   interest concern the S-R link, with a Passive Pervasive Monitor
   (Type-1A) risk.

   Here is a template format for the example:



























Mohaisen & Mankin        Expires January 7, 2016               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft        Evaluation of Privacy for DNS            July 2015


   Eval(Dummy_Traffic (k=10, distribution=uniform),
       System_Setting([S, P, R, A],
       [S-P, P-R, R-A]),
       Risk_Model(Type-1A, S-R)). {
       Privacy_Mechanism{
           Mechanism_name = Dummy_Traffic
           Parameters{
               Queries = 10
               Query_distribution = uniform
       }
       System_settings{
           Entities = S, P, R and A;
           Links = S-P, P-R, R-A
       }
       Risk_Model{
           Type = Type-1A
           Compromised_Entities = NA
           Links = S-R
       }
       Privacy_guarantee = undetectability
       Privacy_measure = 1-(1/(queries+1)).

       Return Privacy_guarantee, Privacy_measure

   }

   Undetectability is provided with 0.91 probability (though we know
   there are other weaknesses for dummy traffic) If the threat model is
   replaced with Type-2, so that responses to arbitrary requests can be
   injected, and tracked, the undetectability probability is decreased.

   7.2 Mixing Network Example

   Here is an input for a mixing network privacy mechanism:

   Eval(mix (u=10, distribution=uniform), System_Setting(link=S-R),
   threat_Model(Type-1A)).

   This indicates that the monitor resides between the stub and
   resolver.  While queries are not undetectable, two queries are not
   linkable to the same individual; the provided guarantee is
   unlinkability.  For a given number of individuals in the mixing
   network, indicated by the parameter u, assuming that at any time,
   traffic from these individuals is uniformly random, the probability
   that one query is comes from a given individual is (1/10=0.1).  The
   probability that two queries are issued by the same initiator is
   0.1^2 = 0.01, which represents the linkability probability.  The
   unlinkability probability is given as 1-0.01 = 0.99.  Thus,

Internet-Draft        Evaluation of Privacy for DNS            July 2015


   (unlinkability, 0.99) < Eval(mix (u=10, distribution=uniform),
   System_Setting(link=S-R), Risk_Model(type-1)).

   We note that even if there is a Type-2 Risk in R, the same results
   hold.

   To sum up, the above example is represented in the following
   template:

   Eval(mix (u=10, distribution=uniform),
       System_Setting([S, P, R, A],
           [S-P, P-R, R-A]),
               Risk_Model(Type-1A, S-R)). {

       Privacy_Mechanism{
           Mechanism_name = mix    //mixing network
           Parameters{
               Users = 10
               Query_distribution = uniform
       }
       System_settings{
           Entities = S, P, R and A;
           Links = S-P, P-R, R-A
       }
       Risk_Model{
           Type = Type-1A
           Entities = NA
           Links = P-R
       }

       Privacy_guarantee = unlinkability
       Privacy_measure = 1-(1/users)^2.

       Return privacy_guarantee, privacy_measure
   }

   7.3 Encrypted Channel (DNS-over-TLS) Example

   For one of the encryption-based mechanisms, DNS-over-TLS
   [dns-over-tls], we have the following template (TLS parameters are
   from [RFC5246]):










Mohaisen & Mankin        Expires January 7, 2016               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft        Evaluation of Privacy for DNS            July 2015


 Eval(TLS_enc (SHA256, ECDSA, port 53, uniform, NA),
     System_Setting([S, P, R, A],
         [S-P, P-R, RA]),
             Risk_Model(Type-1B, S-R)). {

     Privacy_Mechanism{
         Mechanism_name = TLS-upgrade-based
         Parameters{
             Users = NA
             Query_distribution = uniform
             Hash_algorithm = SHA256
             Sig_Algorithm = ECDSA
             Port 53
     }
     System_settings{
         Entities = S, P, R and A;
         Links = S-P, P-R, R-A
     }
     Risk_Model{
         Type = Type-1B
         Entities = NA
         Links = S-R
     }

     Privacy_guarantee = unlinkability, undetectability
     Privacy_measure (unlinkability) = 1
     Privacy_measure (undetectability) = 0 // port 53 indicates DNS used


     Return privacy_guarantee, privacy_measure
 }

   This template features an Active Monitor risk model (Type-2) in order
   to show how that the monitor might apply extra resources to an
   encrypted channel.  Undetectability is an issue whether using
   upgrade-based TLS on port 53, or a port-based TLS on a dedicated port
   - both ports indicate the use of DNS.  The source address of the
   individual is exposed in all cases.  If this were a suitably
   parameterized use of [ipseca], the monitor would not be certain that
   all the traffic from S-R was DNS, and undetectability would be
   higher.

   7.4 Encrypted Channel (IPSec) Example

   In the following, we use the same template above to characterize the
   encryption capabilities provided by IPSec, as a potential mechanisms
   for enabling privacy in DNS exchange.

   Eval(IPSEc_enc([...]),
       System_Setting([S, P, R, A],
           [S-P, P-R, RA]),
               Risk_Model(Type-1B, S-R)). {

       Privacy_Mechanism{
           Mechanism_name = IPSec
           Parameters{
               Users = NA
               Query_distribution = uniform
       }
       System_settings{
           Entities = S, P, R and A;
           Links = S-P, P-R, R-A
       }
       Risk_Model{
           Type = 2
           Entities = NA
           Links = S-R
       }

       Privacy_guarantee = unlinkability, undetectability
       Privacy_measure (unlinkability) = 1
       Privacy_measure (undetectability) = 1


       Return privacy_guarantee, privacy_measure
   }

   We note that IPSec can provide better guarantees with respect to
   studied privacy notions.  However, whether the technique itself is
   widely deployable or not is worth further investigation.

   7.5 QName Minimization Example (R-A) Example

   Analyzing the privacy assurances of QName minimization is a non-
   trivial problem, given that the notions introduced in this document
   are techniques that do not alter items of interest.  This is, the
   notions of privacy as outlined above are concerned with a certain IOI
   that is modified by this technique.  To this end, we modify the
   aforementioned notions to suite this technique for analysis purpose
   only.  For example, we define linkability as the ability of an
   adversary to link two labels of (minimized) queries to each other,
   and relate them to original source of query.  Assuming a reasonable
   use of a recursive that minimizes queries on behalf of users, this
   task is non-trivial, although quantifying the probability would
   depend on the number of labels in queries, the number of queries

   issued, and the number of users using the studied recursive.  The
   following template captures QName minimization as a template

   Eval(Qname_minimisation ([...],
      System_Settings([S, P, R, A], [R-A]),
      Risk_Model(Type=2),
      Privacy_Mechanism{
              Mechanism_name = Qname_minimisation
              Parameters{
                  Qtype_used = NS
             }
          },
      System_settings{
          Entities = S, P, R and A;
          Links = R-A
      },
      Risk_model{
          Type = 2
          Links = R-A
      }
      Privacy_guarantee =  unlinkability
      Privacy_measure = analytical

      Return privacy_guarantee, privacy_measure
   }

   Note that QName minimization does not solve the problem of the
   privacy for a monitoring risk between the stub and recursive.
   Encrypting the channel between the recursive and the stub, utilizing
   other techniques such as TDNS or IPSec, can marginalize such risk.
   Furthermore, note that the risk on the link between the recursive and
   authority name servers is always mitigated by the fact that recursive
   name servers act as a mixer of queries, even when they are sent in
   full to the authority name servers.

   7.7 Private-DNS (S-R) Example

   The template for [privatedns] takes note of deployments in which in
   addition to S, R and A, there is another entity in the system, the
   function that authenticates the individual using S prior to
   permitting an encrypted channel to be formed to R or A.  If the
   Private-DNS connection is with R, then identifiability of S as an
   individual may be similar to the identifiability of S from source
   address, or it may be stronger, depending on the nature of the
   account information required.  If the Private-DNS connection is with
   A, source address PII is provided to A, and linkability of the
   queries from S has probability 1.

8.  Other evaluation

   This document does not address a lot of the evaluation aspects not
   associated with privacy.  For example, some of the mechanisms
   discussed in the working group are built of well-understood and
   standardized technologies, whereas others use other non-standard and
   less widely deployed techniques.  A comprehensive evaluation of such
   mechanisms should take into account such facts.

9.  Security Considerations

   The purpose of this document is to provide methods for those
   deploying or using DNS private exchange to assess the effectiveness
   of privacy mechanisms in depriving monitors of access to private
   information.  Protecting privacy is one of the dimensions of an
   overall security strategy.

   It is possible for privacy-enhancing mechanisms to be deployed in
   ways that are vulnerable to security risks, with the result of not
   achieving security gains.  For the purposes of privacy evaluation, it
   is important for the person making an evaluation to also ensure close
   attention to the content of the Security Considerations section of
   each mechanism being evaluated, for instance, to ensure if TLS is
   used for encryption of a link against surveillance, that TLS best
   security practices [uta-tls-bcp] are in use.

10.  IANA Considerations

   No requests are made to IANA.
