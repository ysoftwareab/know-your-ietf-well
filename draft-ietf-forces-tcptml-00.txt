1. Definitions 
    
   The following definitions are taken from [3], [5] 
    
   ForCES Protocol - While there may be multiple protocols used within 
   the overall ForCES architecture, the term "ForCES protocol" refers 
   only to the protocol used at the Fp reference point in the ForCES 
   Framework in RFC3746 [RFC3746].  This protocol does not apply to 
   CE-to-CE communication, FE-to-FE communication, or to communication 
   between FE and CE managers.  Basically, the ForCES protocol works in 
   a master-slave mode in which FEs are slaves and CEs are masters. 
    
    
   ForCES Protocol Layer (ForCES PL) -- A layer in ForCES protocol 
   architecture that defines the ForCES protocol messages, the protocol 
   state transfer scheme, as well as the ForCES protocol architecture 
   itself (including requirements of ForCES TML (see below)). 
   Specifications of ForCES PL are defined by this document. 
    
   ForCES Protocol Transport Mapping Layer (ForCES TML) -- A layer in 
   ForCES protocol architecture that specifically addresses the 
   protocol message transportation issues, such as how the protocol 
   messages are mapped to different transport media (like TCP, IP, ATM, 
   Ethernet, etc), and how to achieve and implement reliability, 
   multicast, ordering, etc.  This document defines a TCP/IP based 
   ForCES TML. 
         
 
2. Introduction 
     
   The ForCES (Forwarding and Control Element Separation) working group 
   in the IETF is defining the architecture and protocol for separation 
   of control and forwarding elements in network elements such as 
   routers.  [3],  [4]  define  both  architectural  and  protocol 
   requirements for the communication between CE and FE. The ForCES 
   protocol layer [7] describes the protocol specification. It is 
   envisioned that the ForCES protocol would be independent of the 
   interconnect technology between the CE and FE and can run over

   multiple  transport  technologies  and  protocol.  Thus  a  Transport 
   Mapping Layer (TML) has been defined in the protocol framework that 
   will  take  care  of  mapping  the  protocol  messages  to  specific 
   transports. This document defines the TCP/IP based TML for the 
   ForCES protocol layer. It also addresses all the requirements for 
   the TML including security, reliability, etc. 
     
    
3. Protocol Framework Overview 
    
   The reader is referred to the Framework document [4], and in 
   particular sections 3 and 4, for architectural overview and where 
   and how the ForCES protocol fits in.  There may be some content 
   overlap between the ForCES protocol draft [7] and this section in 
   order to provide clarity. 
    
   The ForCES protocol constitutes two pieces: the PL and TML layer. 
   This is depicted in Figure 1 below.

                          Figure 1: ForCES Interface 
    
   The PL layer is in fact the ForCES protocol.  Its semantics and 
   message layout are defined in [7].  The TML Layer is necessary to 
   connect two ForCES PL layers as shown in Figure 1 above.

   Both the PL and TML layers are standardized by the IETF.  While only 
   one PL layer is defined, different TMLs are expected to be 
   standardized.  To interoperate the TML layer at the CE and FE are 
   expected to be of the same definition. 
    
   On transmit, the PL layer delivers its messages to the TML layer. 
   The TML layer delivers the message to the destination TML layer(s). 
   On reception, the TML delivers the message to its destination PL 
   layer(s). 
    
3.1.1.The PL layer 
    
   The PL is common to all implementations of ForCES and is 
   standardized by the IETF [7].  The PL layer is responsible for 
   associating an FE or CE to an NE.  It is also responsible for 
   tearing down such associations.  An FE uses the PL layer to throw 
   various subscribed-to events to the CE PL layer as well as respond 
   to various status requests issued from the CE PL.  The CE configures 
   both the FE and associated LFBs attributes using the PL layer.  In 
   addition the CE may send various requests to the FE to activate or 
   deactivate it, reconfigure itÆs HA parameterization, subscribe to 
   specific events etc.   
    
3.1.2.The TML layer 
    
   The TML layer is essentially responsible for transport of the PL 
   layer messages.  The TML is where the issues of how to achieve 
   transport level reliability, congestion control, multicast, 
   ordering, etc. are handled.  It is expected more than one TML will 
   be standardized.  The different TMLs each could implement things 
   differently based on capabilities of underlying media and transport. 
   However, since each TML is standardized, interoperability is 
   guaranteed as long as both endpoints support the same TML.  All 
   ForCES Protocol Layer implementations should be portable across all 
   TMLs, because all TMLs have the same top edge semantics. 
     
    
4. TCP/IP TML Overview 
 
   The TCP/IP TML consists of two TCP connections between the CE and FE 
   over which the protocol messages are exchanged. One of the 
   connections is called the control channel, over which control 
   messages are exchanged, the other is called data channel over which 
   external protocol packets, such as routing packets will be 
   exchanged. The TCP connections will use unique server port numbers 
   for each of the channels. In addition to this, this TML will provide 
   mechanisms to prioritize the messages over the different channels.

   Some of the rationale for choosing this transport mechanism as well 
   as explanation of how it meets the TML requirements is explained 
   below. 
    
4.1.Rationale for using TCP/IP 
    
   TCP meets all the reliability requirements (no losses, no data 
   corruption, no re-ordering of data) for the ForCES protocol/TML and 
   also provides congestion control mechanism, which is important to 
   meet the scalability requirement. In addition, it helps with 
   interoperability since TCP is a well-understood, widely deployed 
   transport protocol. Using TCP also enables this TML and the protocol 
   to work seamlessly in single hop and multihop scenarios. 
    
4.2.Separate Control and Data channels 
    
   The ForCES NEs are subject to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks 
   [Requirements Section 7 #15]. A malicious system in the network can 
   flood a ForCES NE with bogus control packets such as spurious RIP or 
   OSPF packets in an attempt to disrupt the operation of and the 
   communication between the CEs and FEs. In order to protect against 
   this situation, the TML uses separate control and data channels for 
   communication between the CEs and FEs. Figure 2 below illustrates 
   the different communication channels between the CEs and the FEs; 
   the communication channels for support of High Availability with 
   redundant CEs are also included.

   The data channel carries the control protocol packets such as RIP, 
   OSPF messages as outlined in Requirements [3] Section 7 #10, which 
   are carried in ForCES Packet Redirect messages [7], between the CEs 
   and FEs. All the other ForCES messages, which are used for 
   configuration/capability exchanges, event notification, etc, are 
   carried over the control channel. The data channel is set up only 
   after the control channel is set up. By default, the data channel is 
   established on the CE control channel port number +1. 
    
   The reliability requirements for the data channel messages are 
   different from that of the control messages [Reqs] i.e. they donÆt 
   require strict reliability in terms of retransmission, etc. However 
   congestion control is important for the data channel because in case 
   of DoS attacks, if an unreliable transport such as UDP is used for 
   the data traffic, it can more easily overflow the physical 
   connection, overwhelming the control traffic with congestion. Thus 
   we need a transport protocol that provides congestion control but 
   does not necessarily provide full reliability. Datagram Congestion 
   Control Protocol (DCCP) [11], which is currently being defined, is a 
   transport protocol that exactly meets this requirement. However 
   since it is currently not an IETF standard RFC, and the authors are 
   unaware of any existing implementations, this TML uses TCP as 
   transport protocol for the data channel (for IP interconnect). TCP 
   provides the congestion control mechanism required for the data 
   channel and its wide deployment eases interoperability. 
    
4.3.Reliability

Internet Draft  TCP/IP based TML for ForCES protocol  February 2005 
 
    
   TCP provides the reliability (no losses, no data corruption, no re-
   ordering of data) required for ForCES protocol control messages. 
    
4.4.Congestion Control 
    
   TCP provides congestion control needed to satisfy this requirement. 
    
4.5.Security 
    
   This TML uses TLS [8] to provide security in insecure environments. 
   Please see section 7 on security considerations for more details. 
    
4.6.Addressing 
    
   This TML uses addressing provided by IP layer. For unicast 
   addressing/delivery, it uses the TCP connection between the CE and 
   FE. For multicast/broadcast addressing/delivery, this TML uses 
   multiple TCP connections between the CE and FEs. 
    
4.7.Prioritization 
    
   This TML provides prioritization of messages sent over control 
   channel as compared to the data channel. This has also been found to 
   be useful in face of DoS attacks on the protocol. The details of 
   this are TBD. 
    
4.8.HA Decisions 
    
   The TML layer supports heartbeat messages between peer TML layers to 
   indicate liveness of the entity generating it.  The frequency of the 
   heartbeat message may be specified at protocol initialization time. 
    
4.9.Encapsulations Used 
    
   TML adds its own header on all ForCES protocol messages that it 
   receives, and additionally on messages it generates. The ForCES 
   protocol and TML messages are further encapsulated with a TCP/IP 
   header.  The format of the TML header is specified in Section 5.  
    
5. TML Messaging 
    
   TML adds on a TML header to all messages that it either receives 
   from the PL layer or those messages that it generates.  The TML 
   header is followed by the message body.  The message body may 
   comprise a PL message or it may be a message generated by the TML 
   layer for communicating with its peer.  A flag in the TML header

   specifies whether the message is associated with the PL layer. The 
   next section details the TML header.

                          Figure 3: TCP TML Message Header Format 
5.1.1.Version (version) 
    
   The version field (4 bits) specifies the version of the TML layer 
   protocol supported by the implementation.  An entity implementing 
   the TML layer protocol should be backward compatible with previous 
   versions of the protocol. 
    
5.1.2.Upper Layer Protocol Flag (f) 
    
   The upper layer protocol flag (1 bit) specifies if the TML layer is 
   carrying a message sent by the PL Layer.  If the protocol flag is 
   set, the message body comprises of a PL message which is not 
   interpreted by the peer TML layer; the rest of the TML header and 
   message is ignored by the peer TML layer. If the protocol flag is 
   not set, the message body carries a TML message; hence, the rest of 
   the TML header needs to be read by the peer TML layer and the 
   message body appropriately processed. 
    
5.1.3.Message Type (msgType) 
    
   The message type (6 bits) field is applicable only if the protocol 
   flag field is not set.  It specifies the TML message being sent 
   between peer TML layers. 
    
5.1.4.TML Message Length (tmlMsgLength) 
    
   The TML message length field is applicable only if the protocol flag 
   field is not set.  It specifies the length of the TML message in 
   octets inclusive of the TML header.

5.1.5.TML Message Body 
    
    Format of this is TBD. 
    
5.2.TML Messages 
    
5.2.1.Channel Close  
    
   The channel close message is generated by the TML layer in response 
   to a request to close a specified channel.  This message is sent to 
   the peer TML layer to notify it of the closure.  This provides 
   information to the peer TML layer so it can either close its end of 
   the channel also or drop any messages received by the upper layer 
   protocol.   
    
   ForCES protocol usage: This message may be sent from either the CE 
   or the FE TML layer depending on which entity initiated the close. 
    
5.2.2.Heartbeat 
    
   A heartbeat message is exchanged between peer TML layers to 
   communicate liveness of the entity generating the message. 
    
   ForCES protocol usage: This message may be sent from either the CE 
   to an FE or vice-versa. 
    
5.2.3.Multicast Group Join Request 
    
   The multicast group join request message is triggered by a request 
   from the PL layer to join a specific multicast group. The peer TML 
   layer on receiving this request creates the specified multicast 
   group if it didnÆt previously exist.  It updates the membership of 
   the group to include the entity requesting the join. 
    
   ForCES protocol usage: Since only FEs may be the leaves in a 
   multicast group, this message is sent by the FE TML to the CE TML, 
   due to a join request from the FE PL. 
    
5.2.4.Multicast Group Join Response 
    
   The multicast group join response message is generated by the TML 
   Layer in response to a join request message. 
    
   ForCES protocol usage: If only FEs may be the leaves in a multicast 
   group, this message is generated by the CE TML and sent to the FE 
   TML, in response to the join request message received from the FE 
   TML.

Internet Draft  TCP/IP based TML for ForCES protocol  February 2005 
 
5.2.5.Multicast Group Leave Request 
    
   The multicast group leave request message is triggered by a request 
   from the PL layer to leave a specific multicast group. The peer TML 
   layer on receiving this request removes the specified multicast 
   group if the entity requesting to leave is the only member of the 
   group.  Else, it updates the membership of the group to exclude the 
   entity requesting the leave. 
    
   ForCES protocol usage: If only FEs may be the leaves in a multicast 
   group, this message is sent by the FE TML to the CE TML, due to a 
   leave request from the FE PL. 
    
5.2.6.Multicast Group Leave Response 
    
   The multicast group leave response message is generated by the TML 
   Layer in response to a leave request message. 
    
   ForCES protocol usage: If only FEs may be the leaves in a multicast 
   group, this message is generated by the CE TML and sent to the FE 
   TML, in response to the leave request message received from the FE 
   TML. 
    
    
6. TML Interface to Upper layer Protocol 
 
   ForCES TML interfaces with an upper layer protocol, the PL Layer and 
   a lower layer protocol, TCP (in the case of TCP TML).  This section 
   defines the interface to the upper layer protocol.  This interface 
   should be used only as a guideline in implementing the API.  
   Additionally, although the current interface is defined mainly as a 
   synchronous interface, the interface may be implemented to be 
   asynchronous if desired. 
 
6.1.TML API 
 
6.1.1.TML Initialize  
    
   status tmlInit( 
     in  channelType, 
     in  initAttributes) 
    
   Input Parameters:  
     channelType: control versus data channel 
     initAttributes: initialization parameters 
    
   Output Parameters: 
     none

   Returns: 
     status: SUCCESS 
             Errors TBD 
    
   Synopsis:  
   tmlInit() enables establishment of communication channels on the 
   entity that this API is invoked.  Optionally specifies attributes if 
   any, for initialization. This call does not however result in the 
   setup of any channels.   
    
   ForCES Usage Model:  
   In the case of ForCES which follows a client-server model, this API 
   would be invoked on the CE, which functions as the server. It is 
   invoked once for every class of TML channels on a per channel type 
   basis (control channel versus data channel).  For example, say for 
   control messaging, the CE communicates with five FEs using TCP TML 
   and with another two FEs, using UDP TML.  tmlInit() will need to be 
   invoked twice, once for the TCP TML attributes and once for the UDP 
   TML attributes for the control channel setup with all of the FEs.  
   The same holds true for the data channel setup in the above case. 
    
 
6.1.2.TML Channel Open 
    
   status tmlOpen( 
     in  channelType, 
     in  elementId, 
     in  channelMode, 
     in  channelAttributes, 
     in  eventHandlerCallBack, 
     out channelDescriptor) 
    
   Input Parameters:  
     channelType: control channel or data channel 
     elementId: Specific CE for which channel needs to be setup 
     channelMode: unicast versus multicast 
     channelAttributes: channel establishment parameters 
     eventHandlerCallback: Callback function to be invoked on event 
   generation 
    
   Output Parameters: 
     channelDescriptor: handle to communication channel  
    
   Returns: 
     status: SUCCESS 
             Errors TBD

   Synopsis:  
   tmlOpen() results in a communication channel of type channelType 
   (control versus data), being established with the specified 
   elementId.  The channel may be specified as unicast or multicast via 
   channelMode.  This call may either trigger the establishment of the 
   channel, or if the channel is already established, it only results 
   in a registration for that channel.  In either case, if successful, 
   a handle to the open channel is returned via a channelDescriptor.  
   If this call triggers the establishment of the channel, the channel 
   is established using the channelAttributes parameter specified to 
   the call.  Once the channel is setup (or if already setup prior to 
   this call), the caller of this API is also capable of receiving TML 
   events via the specified event handling callback function. If this 
   call is invoked multiple times on a channel that has already been 
   opened and registered, a return status of ALREADY_REGISTERED is 
   returned, with no change to registration.  
    
   ForCES Usage Model: 
   In the case of ForCES which follows a client-server model, this API 
   would be invoked on the FE by FE PL, which functions as the client. 
   On each FE, it is invoked once per channel that the FE wishes to 
   setup with the CE. 
    
   Notes: 
   In the case of TCP TML, since there is no inherent support for 
   multicast, regardless of the channelMode specified, the specified 
   channel would be setup as a unicast channel; however, the unicast 
   channel would be able to support pseudo multicast.  Hence, there is 
   no need to set up a distinct channel for unicast and a distinct 
   channel for multicast in the case of TCP TML (as may be the case for 
   UDP TML). 
    
 
    
6.1.3. TML Channel Close 
    
   status tmlClose( 
     in  channelDescriptor 
     in  mode) 
    
   Input Parameters:  
     channelDescriptor: handle to communication channel to be 
   terminated 
     mode: mode of operation for the close û forced versus controlled 
    
   Output Parameters: 
     none

   Returns: 
     status: SUCCESS 
             Errors TBD 
    
   Synopsis:  
   Tears down/terminates specified communication channel.  No further 
   CE PL û FE PL messaging is possible after this.  If the mode is 
   specified as controlled, current messages that are pending in the 
   TML layer shall be sent, but no new messages shall be accepted by 
   the TML layer on this channel.  In the forced model, messages 
   pending in the TML layer shall be discarded.  Since the channel was 
   terminated, a subsequent tmlOpen() will trigger establishment of the 
   channel. 
    
   ForCES Usage Model: 
   This API may be invoked by either the CE or the FE.  If the FE PL 
   invokes it, the FE TML sends a message to the CE TML informing it 
   that the channel has been shutdown, which results in an upcall to 
   the CE PL.  This will result in the CE PL also shutting down its end 
   of the channel. 
    
6.1.4.TML Channel Write 
    
   status tmlWrite( 
     in  channelDescriptor, 
     in  msg, 
     in  msgSize, 
     in  timeout, 
     out bytesWritten) 
    
   Input Parameters:  
     channelDescriptor: handle to communication channel to be written 
   to 
     msg: message to be sent 
     msgSize: size of message to be sent 
     timeout: specifies blocking or non-blocking write.  Value of -1 
   implies blocking write (wait forever), value of 0 implies non-
   blocking write 
      
   Output Parameters: 
     bytesWritten: number of bytes actually transmitted

   Sends message over the specified channel.  If the specified 
   channelDescriptor is associated with a multicast group, the message 
   will be sent to all members of the group.  This does not imply that 
   the message has actually been transmitted.  The message is queued in 
   the appropriate queue for transmission.  Once this call returns, the 
   message buffer may be freed.  If TMLÆs message queues are full, the 
   timeout will be used to determine how long to wait prior to 
   returning; if the specified timeout expires, and no message buffer 
   becomes available, the API returns with an error. 
    
   ForCES Usage Model: 
   This API may be invoked by either the FE PL or the CE PL. 
    
    
6.1.5.TML Channel Read 
    
   status tmlRead( 
     in  channelDescriptor, 
     in  msgBuf, 
     in  timeout, 
     out bytesRead) 
    
   Input Parameters:  
     channelDescriptor: handle to communication channel to be read from 
     msgBuf: buffer into which message is to be read 
     timeout: specifies blocking or non-blocking read.  Value of -1 
   implies blocking read (wait forever), value of 0 implies non-
   blocking read 
      
   Output Parameters: 
     bytesRead: number of bytes actually read  
    
   Returns: 
     status: SUCCESS 
             Errors TBD 
    
   Synopsis:  
   Reads message on the specified channel. Once the message is copied 
   into msgBuf specified by the call, the TML message buffer may be 
   freed.  If TMLÆs message queues are empty (no message is available), 
   the timeout will be used to determine how long to wait prior to 
   returning; if the specified timeout expires, and no message becomes 
   available, the API returns with an error. 
   If a non-blocking read is executed, the caller of the API is 
   notified via an upcall when a message becomes available. 
   TBD: If the channelDescriptor specified is associated with a 
   multicast group, it should be considered invalid since multicast is

   only supported on a write; a read is always associated with reading 
   from a single channel. 
    
6.1.6.TML Multicast Group Join 
    
   status tmlMulticastGroupJoin( 
     in  groupAttributes) 
    
   Input Parameters:  
     groupAttributes: Attributes associated with the multicast group to 
   be joined 
    
   Output Parameters: 
     none 
    
   Returns: 
     status: SUCCESS 
             Errors TBD 
    
   Synopsis:  
   Joins the specified multicast group as leaf node in the group. If 
   this is the first join request being received for this group, it 
   results in the creation of the group and the allocation of a 
   groupDescriptor (which is equivalent to a channelDescriptor). Once a 
   member of this group, the entity calling this API will be capable of 
   receiving messages addressed to this multicast group.   
    
   ForCES Usage Model: 
   If the intent is that only FEs can be members of a multicast group 
   and only a CE can be the source of a multicast, this API would be 
   invoked on the FE that wishes to join a multicast group. 
    
6.1.7.TML Multicast Group Leave 
    
   status tmlMulticastGroupLeave( 
     in  groupAttributes)

   Synopsis:  
   Leaves the specified multicast group it had previously joined. Once 
   an entity is not a member of the multicast group, it is no longer 
   capable of receiving messages addressed to group.  If this leave 
   request is associated with the only member of the group, the 
   multicast group is removed, and its associated groupDescriptor 
   invalidated. 
    
   ForCES Usage Model: 
   If the intention is that only FEs can be members of a multicast 
   group and only a CE can be the source of a multicast, this API would 
   be invoked on the FE that wishes to leave a group it had previously 
   joined. 
    
6.2.Protocol Initialization and Shutdown Model 
    
   In order for the peer PL Layers to communicate, the control and data 
   channels must be setup.  This section defines a model for the setup 
   of the channels, using the TML interface defined above. In this 
   model, the peer TML Layers may establish the control and data 
   channels between the FE and the CE without the involvement of the PL 
   Layers, or if desired, the PL Layer may trigger the setup of the 
   channels; this is left as an implementation decision.  Both modes 
   may also be supported within an implementation.   
    
6.2.1.Protocol Initialization 
    
   The control channel must be established between the FE TML and the 
   CE TML for establishment of association to proceed.  This channel 
   will be used for messages related to the association setup and 
   capability query.  The data channel must be established no later 
   than the response from the FE to the CE Topology query message. 
    
   Figure 4 illustrates the initialization model where the PL layer via 
   an interface provided by the TML Layer, triggers the setup of the 
   control and data channels.

The control channel teardown must occur only after the association 
teardown has occurred.  The data channel teardown may occur no earlier 
than the association teardown.

The PL Layer may completely shutdown a channel via invocation of the 
tmlClose() API.  When the PL layer shuts down a channel, the channel is 
torn down; hence ForCES messaging between the CE and FE is no longer 
possible over that channel.  A subsequent tmlOpen() triggers 
establishment of the channel.  This scenario is illustrated in Figure 
5.

6.3.Multicast Model 
    
   The TML layer provides support for multicast.  In the ForCES model, 
   support is required to multicast to the FEs from a CE; in this case, 
   the CE is the source or root of the multicast and the FEs are the 
   leaves. 
    
   Support for multicast requires that a channel for supporting 
   multicast be opened between an FE and the CE.  In the case of TCP 
   TML, the same channel is used for both unicast and multicast 
   messaging since multicast mode is simulated using unicast channels 
   in this case. Once the channel is open, FEs may join and leave 
   specified multicast groups.  The first ômulticast group joinö 
   request from an FE to a CE for a specific multicast group results in 
   the creation of the group and an allocation of a group descriptor 
   (which is similar to a channel descriptor) for the group.  The 
   ômulticast group leaveö request from an FE to the CE on a multicast 
   group with just that one member results in the group being removed 
   and the descriptor deallocated. A tmlWrite() on a unicast channel 
   descriptor results in a unicast message being sent to the FE 
   associated with the channel.  A tmlWrite() on a group descriptor 
   results in multicast messaging. Figure 6 illustrates a multicast 
   scenario with 2 FEs, FE1 and FE2.  In the first case, FE1 joins a 
   multicast group.  In the second case, FE2 joins the same multicast 
   group, and leaves the group some time later.

7. Security Considerations  
    
   If the CE or FE are in a single box and network operator is running 
   under a secured environment then it is up to the network 
   administrator to turn off all the security functions. This is 
   configured during the pre-association phase of the protocol.  
    
   When the CEs, FEs are running over IP networks or in an insecure 
   environment, this TML uses TLS [8] to provide security. The security 
   association between the CEs and FEs MUST be established before any 
   ForCES protocol messages are exchanged between the CEs and FEs.  
    
    
7.1.TLS Usage for this TML 
    
   This section is applicable for CE or FE endpoints that use the TML 
   with TLS [8] to secure communication. 
    
   Since CE is master and FEs are slaves, the FEs are TLS clients and 
   CEs are TLS server. The endpoints that implement TLS MUST perform 
   mutual authentication during TLS session establishment process. CE 
   must request certificate from FE and FE needs to pass the requested 
   information.  
    
   We recommend ôTLS-RSA-with-AES-128-CBC-SHAö cipher suite, but CE or 
   FE may negotiate other TLS cipher suites. TLS must be used for all 
   control channel messages. TLS is optional for the data channel since 
   data channel packets are not encrypted externally to the NE.  
    
   This TML uses TLS to provide security when the NE is in an insecure 
   environment. This is because IPsec provides less flexibility when 
   configuring trust anchors since it is transparent to the application 
   and use of Port identifiers is prohibited within IKE Phase 1. This 
   provides restriction for IPsec to configure trust anchors for each

   application separately and policy configuration is common for all 
   applications. 
    
 
8. IANA Considerations 
  
   The TCP/IP TML needs to have a two well-defined TCP port numbers, 
   which needs to be assigned by IANA.  The control port is referred to 
   as the TCP_TML_CONTROL_PORT.  The data port is referred to as the 
   TCP TML DATA PORT.
