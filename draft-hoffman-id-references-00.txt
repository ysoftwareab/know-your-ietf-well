Abstract

   RFC 2026 places restrictions on how Internet-Drafts can be referred
   to in RFCs.  Over time, the way that the IETF community uses
   Internet-Drafts has changed.  The restrictions from RFC 2026
   sometimes make RFCs inaccurate (because many drafts that are referred
   to are not actually "works in progress", and also make references to
   Internet-Drafts nearly useless to RFC readers.  This document updates
   the one part of RFC 2026, and the one part of RFC 7322, that covers
   referencing Internet-Drafts.

Status of This Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF).  Note that other groups may also distribute
   working documents as Internet-Drafts.  The list of current Internet-
   Drafts is at http://datatracker.ietf.org/drafts/current/.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
   time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
   material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

   This Internet-Draft will expire on November 29, 2015.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC2026], "The Internet Standards Process - Revision 3", places
   restrictions on how Internet-Drafts can be referred to in RFCs and
   other Internet-Drafts.  These restrictions were well-intentioned at
   the time but now have become outdated.  This document updates the
   section of RFC 2026that restricts how Internet-Drafts can be
   referenced.  It also updates [RFC7322], "RFC Style Guide", to reflect
   the changes from RFC 2026.

   Note that this document narrowly updates just one section of
   [RFC2026].  Earlier proposals to make the changes here were abandoned
   because there was a belief that changing one part of RFC 2026 could
   not be done without opening all of RFC 2026 to change, and that was
   too onerous of a task.  This document proves that a limited change
   can be made to RFC 2026 without having to take on the many changes
   that different people in the IETF community may or may not want.

2.  Change to RFC 2026

   The last paragraph of Section 2.2 of RFC 2026 says:

   Note: It is acceptable to reference a standards-track specification
   that may reasonably be expected to be published as an RFC using the
   phrase "Work in Progress" without referencing an Internet-Draft.
   This may also be done in a standards track document itself as long as
   the specification in which the reference is made would stand as a
   complete and understandable document with or without the reference to
   the "Work in Progress".

   This paragraph is replaced with:

Internet-Draft     Referencing Internet-Drafts in RFCs          May 2015


   It is acceptable to reference an Internet-Draft in another Internet-
   Draft or RFC.  Such a reference must be to a specific edition of an
   Internet-Draft by indicating its full filename, such as "draft-ietf-
   somewg-someprotocol-03".

3.  Change to RFC 7322

   Section 4.8.6.4 of RFC 7322, "Referencing Internet-Drafts", says:

   ============

   References to Internet-Drafts may only appear as informative
   references.  Given that several revisions of an I-D may be produced
   in a short time frame, references must include the posting date
   (month and year), the full Internet-Draft file name (including the
   version number), and the phrase "Work in Progress".  Authors may
   reference multiple versions of an I-D.  If the referenced I-D was
   also later published as an RFC, then that RFC must also be listed.

   [SYMBOLIC-TAG]  Last name, First initial., Ed. (if applicable)
                   and First initial. Last name, Ed. (if
                   applicable), "I-D Title", Work in Progress,
                   draft-string-NN, Month Year.

   Example:

   [RFC-STYLE] Flanagan, H. and S. Ginoza, "RFC Style Guide",
               Work in Progress, draft-flanagan-style-01,
               June 2013.

   ============

   This section is replaced with:

   ============

   References to Internet-Drafts may only appear as informative
   references.  Given that several revisions of an I-D may be produced
   in a short time frame, references must include the posting date
   (month and year), the full title, the full Internet-Draft file name
   (including the version number), and a URL to that specific version of
   the draft on the IETF Tools site.  Authors may reference multiple
   versions of an I-D.  If the referenced I-D was also later published
   as an RFC, then that RFC must also be listed.
