Internet-Draft      OAuth 2.0 Security Considerations         March 2011


1.  Definitions

   This document considers the following clients categories:

   Web Application  Such an application is installed on a server.  End-
      users access it via a HTML user interface rendered in the user
      agent on the end-user's device.  All application data relevant to
      the OAuth protocol are stored on the server and is not accessible
      by the user.

   Native Application  Such an app is installed and runs on an end-
      user's device.  All application data relevant to the OAuth
      protocol is accessible by the user.

   JavaScript Application  Such an application is downloaded from a web
      site and runs within the user agent on the end-user's device.  All
      application data relevant to the OAuth protocol is accessible by
      the user.


2.  Security Considerations

   Note: This section focuses on the security principles implementors of
   the protocol MUST consider.  These principles have been derived based
   on the comprehensive security analysis of the OAuth 2.0 protocol
   given in [I-D.lodderstedt-oauth-security].

2.1.  Client Secrets

   Authorization servers can issue client secrets to web applications.
   Application developers MUST ensure confidentiality of client secrets.

   Authorization server MUST NOT issue client secrets to native or
   JavaScript applications.  Instead authorization servers shall utilize
   other means than client authentication to achieve their security
   objectives.  Authorization servers can issue client secrets to native
   applications on a per installation base.

   Authorization servers MUST NOT automatic repeat approvals for clients
   without secrets.

2.2.  Refresh Tokens

   Authorization servers may issue refresh tokens to web and native
   applications.

   Refresh tokens should only be accessible to the authorization server
   and the client the token has been issued to.  The authorization

   server MUST maintain the link between a refresh token and the client
   it has been issued to.  This relation MUST be validated on every
   token refreshment request.

   Authorization server as well as application developers MUST ensure
   confidentiality of refresh tokens, on transit and storage.
   Authorization servers should implement means to detect abuse of
   refresh tokens.

   (what about revocation?)

2.3.  Access Tokens

   Access tokens should only be accessible to the authorization server,
   the target resource servers and the client the token has been issued
   to.  The only exception is the implicit grant where the user agent
   gets access to the access token that is transmitted in the URI
   fragment.

   Application developers MUST NOT store access tokens in non-transient
   memory.

2.4.  Token Scope

   Application developers should only acquire access tokens with the
   minimal scope they need in order to implement the respective
   application function.

2.5.  Phishing attacks on redirect-based flows

   Application developers should, when possible, use external browsers
   instead of browsers embedded in the application for performing the
   end-user authorization process.

   Authorization servers MUST ensure authenticity of the endpoint in
   order to prevent phishing attacks.  For example, they can utilize
   HTTPS server authentication for that purpose.  Moreover, service
   Providers should attempt to educate users about the risks phishing
   attacks pose, and should provide mechanisms that make it easy for
   Users to confirm the authenticity of their sites. e.g. extended
   validation certificates.

2.6.  Request confidentiality

   The following data MUST be transmitted over secure transport (such as
   TLS) only: access tokens, refresh tokens, resource owner passwords,
   authorization codes, and client secrets.

2.7.  Online Guessing Attacks

   Authorization servers MUST prevent guessing attacks on the following
   credentials: authorization codes, refresh tokens, resource owner
   passwords, and client secrets.

   When creating token handles or other secrets not intended for usage
   by human users, the authorization server MUST include a reasonable
   level of entropy in order to mitigate the risk of guessing attacks.

2.8.  Authorization code disclosure

   Confidentiality of authorization codes MUST be ensured on transport,
   even considering browser histories and HTTP referer headers.

   Authorization server as well as the client MUST ensure that
   authorization code transmission is protected by using transport-layer
   mechanisms such as TLS and that the duration of an authorization code
   is limited.

   For web applications, authorization servers MUST authenticate the
   client and validate that the authorization code had been issued to
   the same client.

   For native applications, authorization servers MUST enforce one time
   usage of the authorization code.  Moreover, if an Authorization
   Server observes multiple attempts to redeem an authorization code,
   the Authorization Server MAY want to revoke all tokens granted based
   on the authorization code.

2.9.  Session Fixation

   The session fixation attack leverages the authorization code flow in
   an attempt to get another user to log-in and authorize access on
   behalf of the attacker.  The victim, seeing only a normal request
   from an expected application, approves the request.  The attacker
   then uses the victim's authorization to gain access to the
   information unknowingly authorized by the victim.

   In order to prevent such an attack, authorization servers MUST ensure
   that the redirect_uri used in the authorization flow is the same as
   the redirect_uri used to exchange the respective authorization code
   into tokens.  Authorization servers SHOULD require clients to pre-
   register their redirect_uri's and validate the actual redirect_uri
   against the pre-registered value.

2.10.  Malicious client obtains authorization

   A malicious client could impersonate a valid client and obtain an
   access authorization that way.

   Assumption: It is not the task of the authorization server to protect
   the end-user's device from malicious software.  This is the
   responsibility of the platform running on the particular device
   probably in cooperation with other components of the respective
   ecosystem (e.g. an application management infrastructure).  The sole
   responsibility of the authorization server is to control access to
   the end-user's resources living in resource servers and to prevent
   unauthorized access to them.  Based on this assumption, the following
   countermeasures are recommended.

   If the impersonated client is a web application, the authorization
   server MUST authentication the client.  The authorization server
   SHOULD require clients to pre-register their redirect_uri's and
   validate the actual redirect_uri against the pre-registered value.

   If the impersonated client is an native or JavaScript application,
   the authorization server MUST utilize other means to achieve its
   security objectives.  The authorization server may enforce explicit
   user authentication or ask the end-user for consent.  In this
   context, the user shall be explained the purpose, scope, and duration
   of the authorization.  The authorization server must make the metat-
   data available to the end-user it associates with the particular
   client.  It is up to the user to validate the binding of this data to
   the particular application (e.g.  Name) and to approve the
   authorization request.

   The authorization server MAY also limit the scope of tokens.

2.11.  Resource Owner Password Credentials

   The "Resource Owner Password Credentials" grant type is often used
   for legacy/migration reasons.  It has higher risk because it
   maintains the uid/password anti-pattern and the client could abuse
   the user id and password.  Additionally, because the user does not
   have control over the authorization process, clients using this grant
   type are not limited by scope, but instead have potentially the same
   capabilities as the user themselves.  The client could also acquire
   long-living tokens and pass them up to a attacker web service for
   further abuse.

   Authorization servers and application developers SHOULD minimize use
   of this grant types.  Other flows which facilitate user control and
   transparency should be used instead.

   The authorization server SHOULD generally restrict the scope of
   access tokens issued by this flow.

   The authorization server MUST ensure the resource owners control and
   transparency with respect to all authorizations issued to clients.

2.12.  Authenticity of endpoints

   Authorization servers MUST support validation of endpoint
   authenticity using HTTPS server authentication.

   Application developers MUST validate the authorization server
   endpoint's authenticity and ensure proper handling of CA certificates
   as well as certificate chain validation.
