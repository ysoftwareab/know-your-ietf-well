1.  Introduction

   Modularity and extensibility were among the leading design principles
   of the YANG data modeling language.  As a result, the same YANG
   module can be combined with various sets of other modules and thus
   form a data model that is tailored to meet the requirements of a
   specific use case.  Server implementors are only required to specify
   all YANG modules comprising the data model (together with their
   revisions and other optional choices) in the YANG library data
   ([RFC7895], and Section 5.6.4 of [RFC7950]) implemented by the
   server.  Such YANG modules appear in the data model "side by side",
   i.e., top-level data nodes of each module - if there are any - are
   also top-level nodes of the overall data model.

   Furthermore, YANG has two mechanisms for contributing a schema
   hierarchy defined elsewhere to the contents of an internal node of
   the schema tree; these mechanisms are realized through the following
   YANG statements:

   o  The "uses" statement explicitly incorporates the contents of a
      grouping defined in the same or another module.  See Section 4.2.6
      of [RFC7950] for more details.

   o  The "augment" statement explicitly adds contents to a target node
      defined in the same or another module.  See Section 4.2.8 of
      [RFC7950] for more details.

   With both mechanisms, the source or target YANG module explicitly
   defines the exact location in the schema tree where the new nodes are
   placed.

   In some cases these mechanisms are not sufficient; it is often
   necessary that an existing module (or a set of modules) is added to
   the data model starting at a non-root location.  For example, YANG
   modules such as "ietf-interfaces" [RFC7223] are often defined so as
   to be used in a data model of a physical device.  Now suppose we want
   to model a device that supports multiple logical devices
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-lne-model], each of which has its own instantiation
   of "ietf-interfaces", and possibly other modules, but, at the same
   time, we want to be able to manage all these logical devices from the
   master device.  Hence, we would like to have a schema like this:

     +--rw interfaces
     |  +--rw interface* [name]
     |     ...
     +--rw logical-device* [name]
        +--rw name
        |   ...
        +--rw interfaces
          +--rw interface* [name]
             ...

   With the "uses" approach, the complete schema tree of
   "ietf-interfaces" would have to be wrapped in a grouping, and then
   this grouping would have to be used at the top level (for the master
   device) and then also in the "logical-device" list (for the logical
   devices).  This approach has several disadvantages:

   o  It is not scalable because every time there is a new YANG module
      that needs to be added to the logical device model, we have to
      update the model for logical devices with another "uses" statement
      pulling in contents of the new module.

   o  Absolute references to nodes defined inside a grouping may break
      if the grouping is used in different locations.

   o  Nodes defined inside a grouping belong to the namespace of the
      module where it is used, which makes references to such nodes from
      other modules difficult or even impossible.

   o  It would be difficult for vendors to add proprietary modules when
      the "uses" statements are defined in a standard module.

   With the "augment" approach, "ietf-interfaces" would have to augment
   the "logical-device" list with all its nodes, and at the same time
   define all its nodes at the top level.  The same hierarchy of nodes
   would thus have to be defined twice, which is clearly not scalable
   either.

   This document introduces a new generic mechanism, denoted as schema
   mount, that allows for mounting one data model consisting of any
   number of YANG modules at a specified location of another (parent)
   schema.  Unlike the "uses" and "augment" approaches discussed above,
   the mounted modules needn't be specially prepared for mounting and,
   consequently, existing modules such as "ietf-interfaces" can be
   mounted without any modifications.

   The basic idea of schema mount is to label a data node in the parent
   schema as the mount point, and then define a complete data model to
   be attached to the mount point so that the labeled data node
   effectively becomes the root node of the mounted data model.

   In principle, the mounted schema can be specified at three different
   phases of the data model life cycle:

   1.  Design-time: the mounted schema is defined along with the mount
       point in the parent YANG module.  In this case, the mounted
       schema has to be the same for every implementation of the parent
       module.

   2.  Implementation-time: the mounted schema is defined by a server
       implementor and is as stable as YANG library information, i.e.,
       it may change after an upgrade of server software but not after
       rebooting the server.  Also, a client can learn the entire schema
       together with YANG library data.

   3.  Run-time: the mounted schema is defined by instance data that is
       part of the mounted data model.  If there are multiple instances
       of the same mount point (e.g., in multiple entries of a list),
       the mounted data model may be different for each instance.

   The schema mount mechanism defined in this document provides support
   only for the latter two cases.  Design-time mounts are outside the

   scope of this document, and could be possibly dealt with in a future
   revision of the YANG data modeling language.

   Schema mount applies to the data model, and specifically does not
   assume anything about the source of instance data for the mounted
   schemas.  It may be implemented using the same instrumentation as the
   rest of the system, or it may be implemented by querying some other
   system.  Future specifications may define mechanisms to control or
   monitor the implementation of specific mount points.

   This document allows mounting of complete data models only.  Other
   specifications may extend this model by defining additional
   mechanisms such as mounting sub-hierarchies of a module.

   Tree diagrams used in this document follow the notation defined in
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-tree-diagrams].

2.1.  Glossary of New Terms

   o  inline schema: a mounted schema whose definition is provided as
      part of the mounted data, using YANG library [RFC7895].

   o  mount point: container or list node whose definition contains the
      "mount-point" extension statement.  The argument of the
      "mount-point" statement defines the name of the mount point.

   o  parent schema (of a particular mounted schema): the schema that
      contains the mount point for the mounted schema.

   o  top-level schema: a schema according to [RFC7950] in which schema
      trees of each module (except augments) start at the root node.

2.2.  Namespace Prefixes

   In this document, names of data nodes, YANG extensions, actions and
   other data model objects are often used without a prefix, as long as
   it is clear from the context in which YANG module each name is
   defined.  Otherwise, names are prefixed using the standard prefix
   associated with the corresponding YANG module, as shown in Table 1.

3.  Schema Mount

   The schema mount mechanism defined in this document provides a new
   extensibility mechanism for use with YANG 1.1.  In contrast to the
   existing mechanisms described in Section 1, schema mount defines the
   relationship between the source and target YANG modules outside these
   modules.  The procedure consists of two separate steps that are
   described in the following subsections.

Internet-Draft              YANG Schema Mount             September 2017


3.1.  Mount Point Definition

   A "container" or "list" node becomes a mount point if the
   "mount-point" extension (defined in the "ietf-yang-schema-mount"
   module) is used in its definition.  This extension can appear only as
   a substatement of "container" and "list" statements.

   The argument of the "mount-point" extension is a YANG identifier that
   defines the name of the mount point.  A module MAY contain multiple
   "mount-point" statements having the same argument.

   It is therefore up to the designer of the parent schema to decide
   about the placement of mount points.  A mount point can also be made
   conditional by placing "if-feature" and/or "when" as substatements of
   the "container" or "list" statement that represents the mount point.

   The "mount-point" statement MUST NOT be used in a YANG version 1
   module.  Note, however, that modules written in any YANG version,
   including version 1, can be mounted under a mount point.

   Note that the "mount-point" statement does not define a new data
   node.

3.2.  Specification of the Mounted Schema

   Mounted schemas for all mount points in the parent schema are
   determined from state data in the "yangmnt:schema-mounts" container.
   Data in this container is intended to be as stable as data in the
   top-level YANG library [RFC7895].  In particular, it SHOULD NOT
   change during the same management session.

   Generally, the modules that are mounted under a mount point have no
   relation to the modules in the parent schema; specifically, if a
   module is mounted it may or may not be present in the parent schema
   and, if present, its data will generally have no relationship to the
   data of the parent.  Exceptions are possible and such needs to be
   defined in the model defining the exception, e.g., the interface
   module in [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-lne-model].

   The "schema-mounts" container has the "mount-point" list as one of
   its children.  Every entry of this list refers through its key to a
   mount point and specifies the mounted schema.

   If a mount point is defined in the parent schema but does not have an
   entry in the "mount-point" list, then the mounted schema is void,
   i.e., instances of that mount point MUST NOT contain any data above
   those that are defined in the parent schema.

Internet-Draft              YANG Schema Mount             September 2017


   If multiple mount points with the same name are defined in the same
   module - either directly or because the mount point is defined in a
   grouping and the grouping is used multiple times - then the
   corresponding "mount-point" entry applies equally to all such mount
   points.

   The "config" property of mounted schema nodes is overridden and all
   nodes in the mounted schema are read-only ("config false") if at
   least one of the following conditions is satisfied for a mount point:

   o  the mount point is itself defined as "config false"

   o  the "config" leaf in the corresponding entry of the "mount-point"
      list is set to "false".

   An entry of the "mount-point" list can specify the mounted schema in
   two different ways:

   1.  by stating that the schema is available inline, i.e., in run-time
       instance data; or

   2.  by referring to one or more entries of the "schema" list in the
       same instance of "schema-mounts".

   In case 1, the mounted schema is determined at run time: every
   instance of the mount point that exists in the parent tree MUST
   contain a copy of YANG library data [RFC7895] that defines the
   mounted schema exactly as for a top-level data model.  A client is
   expected to retrieve this data from the instance tree, possibly after
   creating the mount point.  Instances of the same mount point MAY use
   different mounted schemas.

   In case 2, the mounted schema is defined by the combination of all
   "schema" entries referred to in the "use-schema" list.  In this case,
   the mounted schema is specified as implementation-time data that can
   be retrieved together with YANG library data for the parent schema,
   i.e., even before any instances of the mount point exist.  However,
   the mounted schema has to be the same for all instances of the mount
   point.  Note, that in this case a mount point may include a mounted
   YANG library module and the data contained in the mounted module MUST
   exactly match the data contained in the "schema" entries associated
   with the mount point.

   Each entry of the "schema" list contains:

   o  a list in the YANG library format specifying all YANG modules (and
      revisions etc.) that are implemented or imported in the mounted

      schema.  Note that this includes modules that solely augment other
      listed modules;

   o  (optionally) a new "mount-point" list that applies to mount points
      defined within the mounted schema.

3.3.  Multiple Levels of Schema Mount

   YANG modules in a mounted schema MAY again contain mount points under
   which subschemas can be mounted.  Consequently, it is possible to
   construct data models with an arbitrary number of schema levels.  A
   subschema for a mount point contained in a mounted module can be
   specified in one of the following ways:

   o  by implementing "ietf-yang-library" and "ietf-yang-schema-mount"
      modules in the mounted schema, and specifying the subschemas
      exactly as it is done in the top-level schema

   o  by using the "mount-point" list inside the corresponding "schema"
      entry.

   The former method is applicable to both "inline" and "use-schema"
   cases whereas the latter requires the "use-schema" case.  On the
   other hand, the latter method allows for a compact representation of
   a multi-level schema the does not rely on the presence of any
   instance data.

4.  Referring to Data Nodes in the Parent Schema

   A fundamental design principle of schema mount is that the mounted
   data model works exactly as a top-level data model, i.e., it is
   confined to the "mount jail".  This means that all paths in the
   mounted data model (in leafrefs, instance-identifiers, XPath
   expressions, and target nodes of augments) are interpreted with the
   mount point as the root node.  YANG modules of the mounted schema as
   well as corresponding instance data thus cannot refer to schema nodes
   or instance data outside the mount jail.

   However, this restriction is sometimes too severe.  A typical example
   is network instances (NI) [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-ni-model], where each NI
   has its own routing engine but the list of interfaces is global and
   shared by all NIs.  If we want to model this organization with the NI
   schema mounted using schema mount, the overall schema tree would look
   schematically as follows:







Bjorklund & Lhotka       Expires March 31, 2018                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft              YANG Schema Mount             September 2017


     +--rw interfaces
     |  +--rw interface* [name]
     |     ...
     +--rw network-instances
        +--rw network-instance* [name]
           +--rw name
           +--rw root
              +--rw routing
                 ...

   Here, the "root" node is the mount point for the NI schema.  Routing
   configuration inside an NI often needs to refer to interfaces (at
   least those that are assigned to the NI), which is impossible unless
   such a reference can point to a node in the parent schema (interface
   name).

   Therefore, schema mount also allows for such references.  For every
   schema mounted using the "use-schema" method, it is possible to
   specify a leaf-list named "parent-reference" that contains zero or
   more XPath 1.0 expressions.  Each expression is evaluated with the
   node in the parent data tree where the mount point is defined as the
   context node.  The result of this evaluation MUST be a nodeset (see
   the description of the "parent-reference" node for a complete
   definition of the evaluation context).  For the purposes of
   evaluating XPath expressions within the mounted data tree, the union
   of all such nodesets is added to the accessible data tree.

   It is worth emphasizing that

   o  The nodes specified in "parent-reference" leaf-list are available
      in the mounted schema only for XPath evaluations.  In particular,
      they cannot be accessed there via network management protocols
      such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].

   o  The mechanism of referencing nodes in the parent schema is not
      available for schemas mounted using the "inline" method.

5.  RPC operations and Notifications

   If a mounted YANG module defines an RPC operation, clients can invoke
   this operation by representing it as an action defined for the
   corresponding mount point, see Section 7.15 of ^RFC7950.  An example
   of this is given in Appendix A.4.

   Similarly, if the server emits a notification defined at the top
   level of any mounted module, it MUST be represented as if the
   notification was connected to the mount point, see Section 7.16 of
   [RFC7950].

Internet-Draft              YANG Schema Mount             September 2017


   Note, inline actions and notifications will not work when they are
   contained within a list node without a "key" statement (see section
   7.15 and 7.16 of [RFC7950]).  Therefore, to be useful, mount points
   which contain modules with RPCs, actions, and notifications SHOULD
   NOT have any ancestor node that is a list node without a "key"
   statement.  This requirement applies to the definition of modules
   using the "mount-point" extension statement.

6.  Implementation Notes

   Network management of devices that use a data model with schema mount
   can be implemented in different ways.  However, the following
   implementations options are envisioned as typical:

   o  shared management: instance data of both parent and mounted
      schemas are accessible within the same management session.

   o  split management: one (master) management session has access to
      instance data of both parent and mounted schemas but, in addition,
      an extra session exists for every instance of the mount point,
      having access only to the mounted data tree.

10.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a mechanism for combining schemas from
   different YANG modules into a single schema, and as such doesn't
   introduce new security issues.

11.  Contributors

   The idea of having some way to combine schemas from different YANG
   modules into one has been proposed independently by several groups of
   people: Alexander Clemm, Jan Medved, and Eric Voit
   ([I-D.clemm-netmod-mount]); and Lou Berger and Christian Hopps:

   o  Lou Berger, LabN Consulting, L.L.C., <lberger@labn.net>

   o  Alexander Clemm, Huawei, <alexander.clemm@huawei.com>

Appendix A.  Example: Device Model with LNEs and NIs

   This non-normative example demonstrates an implementation of the
   device model as specified in Section 2 of
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-device-model], using both logical network elements
   (LNE) and network instances (NI).

A.1.  Physical Device

   The data model for the physical device may be described by this YANG
   library content:

   }

A.2.  Logical Network Elements

   Each LNE can have a specific data model that is determined at run
   time, so it is appropriate to mount it using the "inline" method,
   hence the following "schema-mounts" data:

   "ietf-yang-schema-mount:schema-mounts": {
     "mount-point": [
       {
         "module": "ietf-logical-network-element",
         "name": "root",
         "inline": [null]
       }
     ]
   }

   An administrator of the host device has to configure an entry for
   each LNE instance, for example,

     "ietf-interfaces:interfaces": {
       "interface": [
         {
           "name": "eth0",

         },
         ...
       ]
     }
   }

   and then also place necessary state data as the contents of the
   "root" instance, which should include at least

   o  YANG library data specifying the LNE's data model, for example:

   o  state data for interfaces assigned to the LNE instance (that
      effectively become system-controlled interfaces for the LNE), for
      example:

     ],
     "mount-point": [

                  ni:bind-network-instance-name = current()/../ni:name]"
             ]
           }
         ]

           },
           {

             "revision": "2016-11-04",
             "namespace":
              "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing",
             "conformance-type": "implement"
           },
           {
             "name": "ietf-routing",
             "revision": "2016-11-04",
             "feature": [
               "multiple-ribs",
               "router-id"

             "namespace": "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-routing",

           }
         ]
       }
     ]
   }

   Note also that the "ietf-interfaces" module appears in the
   "parent-reference" leaf-list for the mounted NI schema.  This means
   that references to LNE interfaces, such as "outgoing-interface" in
   static routes, are valid despite the fact that "ietf-interfaces"
   isn't part of the NI schema.

A.4.  Invoking an RPC Operation

   Assume that the mounted NI data model also implements the "ietf-isis"
   module [I-D.ietf-isis-yang-isis-cfg].  An RPC operation defined in
   this module, such as "clear-adjacency", can be invoked by a client
   session of a LNE's RESTCONF server as an action tied to a the mount
   point of a particular network instance using a request URI like this
   (all on one line):

     POST /restconf/data/ietf-network-instance:network-instances/
         network-instance=rtrA/root/ietf-isis:clear-adjacency HTTP/1.1
