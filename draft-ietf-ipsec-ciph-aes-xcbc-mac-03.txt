Abstract

   A Message Authentication Code (MAC) is a key-dependent one way hash
   function.  One popular way to construct a MAC algorithm is to use a
   block cipher in conjunction with the Cipher-Block-Chaining (CBC) mode
   of operation.  The classic CBC-MAC algorithm, while secure for mes-
   sages of a pre-selected fixed length, has been shown to be insecure
   across messages of varying lengths such as the type found in typical
   IP datagrams.  This memo specifies the use of AES in CBC mode with a
   set of extensions to overcome this limitation.  This new algorithm is
   named AES-XCBC-MAC-96.

1. Introduction

   Message authentication provides data integrity and data origin au-
   thentication with respect to the original message source.  A Message
   Authentication Code (MAC) is a key-dependent one way hash function.
   One popular way to construct a MAC algorithm is to use a block cipher
   in conjunction with the Cipher-Block-Chaining (CBC) mode of opera-
   tion.  The classic CBC-MAC algorithm, while secure for messages of a
   pre-selected fixed length [CBC-MAC-2], has been shown to be insecure
   across messages of varying lengths such as the type found in typical
   IP datagrams [CBC-MAC-2, section 5].  In fact, it is trivial to pro-
   duce forgeries for a second message given the MAC of a prior message.
   [HANDBOOK, section 9.62, p. 354]

   This memo specifies the use of AES [AES] in CBC mode [MODES] with a
   set of extensions [XCBC-MAC-1] to overcome this limitation.  This new
   algorithm is named AES-XCBC-MAC-96.  Using the AES block cipher, with
   its increased block size (128 bits) and increased key length (128
   bits), provides the new algorithm with the ability to withstand con-
   tinuing advances in crypto-analytic techniques and computational ca-
   pability.  AES-XCBC-MAC-96 is used as an authentication mechanism
   within the context of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)
   and the Authentication Header (AH) protocols.  For further informa-
   tion on ESP, refer to [ESP] and [ROADMAP].  For further information
   on AH, refer to [AH] and [ROADMAP].

   The goal of AES-XCBC-MAC-96 is to ensure that the datagram is authen-
   tic and cannot be modified in transit.  Data integrity and data ori-
   gin authentication as provided by AES-XCBC-MAC-96 are dependent upon
   the scope of the distribution of the secret key. If the key is known
   only by the source and destination, this algorithm will provide both
   data origin authentication and data integrity for datagrams sent be-
   tween the two parties.  In addition, only a party with the identical
   key can verify the hash.


2. Specification of Requirements

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" that
   appear in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC-2119].

3. Basic CBC-MAC with Obligatory 10* Padding

   CBC-MAC uses a block cipher for encryption; the block cipher trans-
   forms b bits of plaintext to b bits of ciphertext.  The basic CBC-MAC
   [CBC-MAC-1, CBC-MAC-2] with Obligatory 10* Padding over a b-bit block
   cipher is calculated as follows for a message M:

     (1)  Append a single 1 bit to M.  Then append the minimum number of
          0 bits to M such that the length of M is a multiple of b.
          [NOTE: This is 1 of several padding schemes that can be used
          for CBC-MAC. Several others are described in [MODES].]



Frankel,Herbert                                                 [Page 3]

INTERNET DRAFT <draft-ietf-ipsec-ciph-aes-xcbc-mac-03.txt> February 2003


     (2)  Break M into n blocks, M[1] ... M[n], where the blocksize of
          blocks M[1] ... M[n] is b bits

     (3)  Define E[0] = 0x00000000000000000000000000000000

     (4)  For each block M[i], where i = 1 ... n:
             XOR M[i] with E[i-1], then encrypt the result with Key K,
             yielding E[i].

     (5)  E[n] is the b-bit authenticator.

   Basic CBC-MAC with obligatory 10* padding has been shown to be secure
   for messages up to (but not including) a pre-selected fixed length,
   in which the length is a multiple of the blocksize.  This algorithm
   is not suitable for IPsec for the following reasons:

     +    Any IPsec authenticator must be able to handle messages of
          arbitrary length.  However, the basic CBC-MAC cannot securely
          handle messages that exceed the pre-selected fixed length.

     +    For messages shorter than the pre-selected fixed length,
          padding the message to the pre-selected fixed length may
          necessitate additional encryption operations, adding an unac-
          ceptable computational penalty.



4. AES-XCBC-MAC-96

   [AES] describes the underlying AES algorithm, while [CBC-MAC-1] and
   [XCBC-MAC-1] describe the AES-XCBC-MAC algorithm.

   The AES-XCBC-MAC-96 algorithm is a variant of the basic CBC-MAC with
   obligatory 10* padding; however, AES-XCBC-MAC-96 is secure for mes-
   sages of arbitrary length.  The AES-XCBC-MAC-96 calculations require
   numerous encryption operations; this encryption MUST be accomplished
   using AES with a 128-bit key.  Given a 128-bit secret key K, AES-
   XCBC-MAC-96 is calculated as follows for a message M that consists of
   n blocks, M[1] ... M[n], in which the blocksize of blocks M[1] ...
   M[n-1] is 128 bits and the blocksize of block M[n] is between 1 and
   128 bits:

     (1)  Derive 3 128-bit keys (K1, K2 and K3) from the 128-bit secret
          key K, as follows:
            K1 = 0x01010101010101010101010101010101 encrypted with Key K
            K2 = 0x02020202020202020202020202020202 encrypted with Key K
            K3 = 0x03030303030303030303030303030303 encrypted with Key K

     (2)  Define E[0] = 0x00000000000000000000000000000000

     (3)  For each block M[i], where i = 1 ... n-1:
             XOR M[i] with E[i-1], then encrypt the result with Key K1,
             yielding E[i].




Frankel,Herbert                                                 [Page 4]

INTERNET DRAFT <draft-ietf-ipsec-ciph-aes-xcbc-mac-03.txt> February 2003


     (4)  For block M[n]:

          (a)  If the blocksize of M[n] is 128 bits:
                  XOR M[n] with E[n-1] and Key K2, then encrypt the
                  result with Key K1, yielding E[n].

          (b)  If the blocksize of M[n] is less than 128 bits:

               (i)  Pad M[n] with a single "1" bit, followed by the num-
                    ber of "0" bits (possibly none) required to increase
                    M[n]'s blocksize to 128 bits.

               (ii) XOR M[n] with E[n-1] and Key K3, then encrypt the
                    result with Key K1, yielding E[n].



     (5)  The authenticator value is the leftmost 96 bits of the 128-bit
          E[n].

   NOTE1: If M is the empty string, pad and encrypt as in (4)(b) to cre-
   ate M[1] and E[1]. This will never be the case for ESP or AH, but is
   included for completeness sake.

   NOTE2: [CBC-MAC-1] defines K1 as follows:
                  K1 = Constant1A encrypted with Key K |
                     Constant1B encrypted with Key K.
           However, the second encryption operation is only needed for
           AES-XCBC-MAC with keys greater than 128 bits; thus, it is not
           included in the definition of AES-XCBC-MAC-96.

   AES-XCBC-MAC-96 verification is performed as follows:
      Upon receipt of the AES-XCBC-MAC-96 authenticator, the entire
      128-bit value is computed and the first 96 bits are compared to
      the value stored in the authenticator field.

4.1 Keying Material

   AES-XCBC-MAC-96 is a secret key algorithm. For use with either ESP or
   AH a fixed key length of 128-bits MUST be supported. Key lengths
   other than 128-bits MUST NOT be supported (i.e. only 128-bit keys are
   to be used by AES-XCBC-MAC-96).

   AES-XCBC-MAC-96 actually requires 384 bits of keying material (128
   bits for the AES keysize + 2 times the blocksize). This keying mate-
   rial can either be provided through the key generation mechanism or
   it can be generated from a single 128-bit key. The latter approach
   has been selected for AES-XCBC-MAC-96, since it is analogous to other
   authenticators used within IPsec.  The reason AES-XCBC-MAC-96 uses 3
   keys is so the length of the input stream does not need to be known
   in advance. This may be useful for systems that do one-pass assembly
   of large packets.

   A strong pseudo-random function MUST be used to generate the required



Frankel,Herbert                                                 [Page 5]

   128-bit key. This key, along with the 3 derived keys (K1, K2 and K3),
   should be used for no purposes other than those specified in the
   algorithm.  In particular, they should not be used as keys in another
   cryptographic setting.  Such abuses will invalidate the security of
   the authentication algorithm.

   At the time of this writing there are no specified weak keys for use
   with AES-XCBC-MAC-96. This does not mean to imply that weak keys do
   not exist.  If, at some point, a set of weak keys for AES-XCBC-MAC-96
   are identified, the use of these weak keys MUST be rejected followed
   by a request for replacement keys or a newly negotiated Security
   Association.

   [ARCH] describes the general mechanism for obtaining keying material
   when multiple keys are required for a single SA (e.g. when an ESP SA
   requires a key for confidentiality and a key for authentication).

   In order to provide data origin authentication, the key distribution
   mechanism must ensure that unique keys are allocated and that they
   are distributed only to the parties participating in the communica-
   tion.

   Current attacks do not necessitate a specific recommended frequency
   for key changes. However, periodic key refreshment is a fundamental
   security practice that helps against potential weaknesses of the
   function and the keys, reduces the information available to a crypt-
   analyst, and limits the damage resulting from a compromised key.

4.2 Padding

   AES-XCBC-MAC-96 operates on 128-bit blocks of data. Padding require-
   ments are specified in [CBC-MAC-1] and are part of the XCBC algo-
   rithm. If you build AES-XCBC-MAC-96 according to [CBC-MAC-1] you do
   not need to add any additional padding as far as AES-XCBC-MAC-96 is
   concerned. With regard to "implicit packet padding" as defined in
   [AH], no implicit packet padding is required.


4.3 Truncation

   AES-XCBC-MAC produces a 128-bit authenticator value.  AES-XCBC-MAC-96
   is derived by truncating this 128-bit value as described in [HMAC]
   and verified in [XCBC-MAC-2].  For use with either ESP or AH, a trun-
   cated value using the first 96 bits MUST be supported.  Upon sending,
   the truncated value is stored within the authenticator field. Upon
   receipt, the entire 128-bit value is computed and the first 96 bits
   are compared to the value stored in the authenticator field. No other
   authenticator value lengths are supported by AES-XCBC-MAC-96.

   The length of 96 bits was selected because it is the default authen-
   ticator length as specified in [AH] and meets the security require-
   ments described in [XCBC-MAC-2].

4.4 Interaction with the ESP Cipher Mechanism

   As of this writing, there are no known issues which preclude the use
   of AES-XCBC-MAC-96 with any specific cipher algorithm.

4.5 Performance

   For any CBC MAC variant, the major computational effort is expended
   in computing the underlying block cipher.  This algorithm uses a min-
   imum number of AES invocations, one for each block of the message or
   fraction thereof, resulting in performance equivalent to classic CBC-
   MAC.

   The key expansion requires 3 additional AES encryption operations,
   but these can be performed once in advance for each secret key.

   MAC algorithm, who verified them with 2 independent implementations.

5. Security Considerations

   The security provided by AES-XCBC-MAC-96 is based upon the strength
   of AES.  At the time of this writing there are no practical crypto-
   graphic attacks against AES or AES-XCBC-MAC-96.

   As is true with any cryptographic algorithm, part of its strength
   lies in the correctness of the algorithm implementation, the security
   of the key management mechanism and its implementation, the strength
   of the associated secret key, and upon the correctness of the imple-
   mentation in all of the participating systems.  This draft contains
   test vectors to assist in verifying the correctness of AES-XCBC-
   MAC-96 code.

6. IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned AH Transform Identifier XX to AH_AES-XCBC-MAC.
   IANA has assigned AH/ESP Authentication Algorithm Value XX to AES-
   XCBC-MAC.
