Abstract

   When a receiver joins a multicast session, it may need to acquire and
   parse certain key information before it can process any data sent in
   the multicast session.  Depending on the join time, length of the key
   information repetition interval, size of the key information as well
   as the application and transport properties, the time lag before a
   receiver can usefully consume the multicast data, which we refer to

   as the synchronization delay, varies and may be large.  This is an
   undesirable phenomenon for receivers that frequently switch among
   different multicast sessions, such as video broadcasts.  In this
   document, we describe a method using existing RTP and RTCP protocol
   machinery that reduces the synchronization delay.  In this method, an
   auxiliary unicast RTP session carrying the key information to the
   receiver precedes/accompanies the multicast flow.  This unicast flow
   may be transmitted at a faster than natural rate to further
   accelerate the synchronization.  The motivating use case for this
   capability is multicast applications that carry real-time compressed
   audio and video.  However, the proposed method can also be used in
   other types of multicast applications where the synchronization delay
   is long enough to be a problem.

1.  Introduction

   Most multicast flows carry a stream of inter-related data.  Certain
   information must first be acquired by the receivers to start
   processing any data sent in the multicast session.  This document
   refers to this information as "Key Information."  The key information
   is conventionally sent periodically in the multicast session and
   usually consists of items such as a description of the schema for the
   rest of the data, references to which data to process for the
   receivers, encryption information including keys, as well as any
   other information required to process the data in the multicast flow.

   Real-time multicast applications require the receivers to buffer
   data.  The receiver may have to buffer data to smooth out the network
   jitter, to allow loss-repair methods such as forward error correction
   and retransmission to recover the missing packets, and to satisfy the
   data processing requirements of the application layer.

   When a receiver joins a multicast session, it has no control over
   what point in the flow is currently being transmitted.  Sometimes the
   receiver may join the session right before the key information is
   sent in the session.  In this case, the required waiting time is
   usually minimal.  Similarly, the receiver may also join the session
   right after the key information has been transmitted.  In this case
   the receiver has to wait for the key information to appear again in
   the stream before it can start processing any multicast data.  In
   some other cases, the key information is not contiguous in the flow
   but dispersed over a large period, which forces the receiver to wait
   for all of the key information to arrive before starting to process
   the rest of the data.

   The net effect of waiting for the key information and waiting for
   various buffers to fill up is that the receivers may experience
   significantly large delays in data processing.  In this document, we
   refer to the difference between the time a receiver joins the
   multicast session and the time the receiver acquires all the
   necessary key information as the "Synchronization Delay."  The
   synchronization delay may not be the same for different receivers; it
   usually varies depending on the join time, length of the key
   information repetition interval, size of the key information as well
   as the application and transport properties.

   The varying nature of the synchronization delay adversely affects the
   receivers that frequently switch among multicast sessions.  In this
   specification, we address this problem for RTP-based multicast
   applications and describe a method that uses the fundamental tools
   offered by the existing RTP and RTCP protocols [RFC3550].  In this
   method, either the multicast source (or the distribution source in a

   single-source multicast (SSM) session) retains key information for a
   period after transmission, or an intermediary network element joins
   the multicast session and continuously caches the key information as
   it is sent in the session and acts as a feedback target (See
   [I-D.ietf-avt-rtcpssm]) for the session.  When a receiver wishes to
   join the same multicast session, instead of simply issuing an
   Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) [RFC3376] Join message, it
   sends a request to the feedback target address for the session asking
   for the key information.  The feedback target starts a unicast
   retransmission RTP session and sends the key information to the
   receiver over that session.  If there is spare bandwidth, the
   feedback target may also burst the key information at a faster than
   natural rate.  As soon as the receiver acquires the key information,
   it can join the multicast group and start processing the multicast
   data.  This method potentially reduces the synchronization delay.  We
   refer to this method as "Unicast-based Rapid Synchronization with RTP
   Multicast Sessions."  A simplified network diagram showing the rapid
   synchronization method through an intermediary network element is
   depicted in Figure 1.

   A primary design goal in this solution is to use the existing tools
   in the RTP protocol family.  This improves the versatility of the
   existing implementations, and promotes faster deployment and better
   interoperability.  To this effect, we use the unicast retransmission

   support of RTP [RFC4588] and the capabilities of RTCP to handle the
   signaling needed to accomplish the synchronization.  The packet(s)
   carrying the key information are sent by the feedback target in the
   auxiliary unicast session for rapid synchronization.  These are
   constructed as retransmission packets that would have been sent in a
   unicast RTP session to recover the missing packets at a receiver that
   has never received any packet.  In fact, there is a single RTP
   session used for both rapid synchronization and loss repair.  The
   conventional RTCP feedback message that requests the retransmission
   of the missing packets [RFC4585] indicates their sequence numbers.
   However, upon joining a new session the receiver has never received a
   packet and thus, does not know the sequence numbers.  Instead, the
   receiver sends an RTCP feedback message indicating "picture loss" to
   request the key information needed to rapidly synchronize with the
   main multicast session.  [RFC4585] provides support for this special
   RTCP feedback message.  It is also worth noting that in order to
   issue the initial RTCP message to the feedback target, the SSRC of
   the session to be joined must be known prior to any packet reception,
   and hence, needs to be signaled out-of-band (or in-band).  In a
   Session Description Protocol (SDP) description, the SSRC MUST be
   signaled through the 'ssrc' attribute [I-D.ietf-avt-rtcpssm].

   In the rest of this specification, we have the following outline:  In
   Section 4, we describe the delay components in generic multicast
   applications.  In Section 5, we introduce the delay components that
   are specific to MPEG-based video.  We provide the protocol details of
   the rapid synchronization method in Section 6.  Section 7 and
   Section 8 discuss the SDP signaling issues with examples and NAT-
   related issues, respectively.  Finally, in Section 9 we provide a
   pointer to an open source RTP Receiver code that implements the
   functionalities introduced in this document.  Note that Section 3
   provides a list of the acronyms used frequently in this document.

   It should be noted that while we primarily focus on multicast
   applications that carry compressed audio and video in explaining the
   protocol details, the same described method can also be used in
   multicast applications that carry other types of data.

4.  Elements of Delay in Multicast Streams

   In an any-source (ASM) or a single-source (SSM) multicast delivery

   synchronization delay when a receiver switches from one multicast
   session to another one.  These are:

   o  Multicast switching delay

   o  Key information latency

   o  Buffering delays

   Multicast switching delay is the delay that is experienced to leave
   the current multicast session (if any) and join the new multicast
   session.  In typical systems, the multicast join and leave operations
   are handled by a group management protocol.  For example, the
   receivers and routers participating in a multicast session may use
   the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) [RFC3376].  In
   [RFC3376], when a receiver wants to join a multicast session, it
   sends an IGMP Join message to its upstream router and the routing
   infrastructure sets up the multicast forwarding state to deliver the
   packets of the multicast session to the new receiver.  Depending on
   the proximity of the upstream router, the current state of the
   multicast tree, the load on the system and the protocol
   implementation, the join times vary.  Current systems provide join
   latencies usually less than 200 milliseconds (ms).  If the receiver
   had been participating in another multicast session before joining
   the new session, it needs to send an IGMP Leave message to its
   upstream router to leave the session.  The leave times are usually
   smaller than the join times, however, it is possible that the Leave
   and Join messages may get lost, in which case the multicast switching
   delay inevitably increases.

   Key information latency is the time it takes the receiver to acquire
   the key information.  It is highly dependent on the proximity of the
   actual time the receiver joined the session to the next time the key
   information will be sent to the receivers in the session, whether the
   key information is sent contiguously or not, and the size of the key
   information.  For some multicast flows, there is a little or no
   interdependency in the data, in which case the key information
   latency will be nil or negligible.  For other multicast flows, there
   is a high degree of interdependency.  One example is the multicast
   flows that carry compressed audio/video.  For these flows, the key
   information latency may become quite large and be a major contributor
   to the overall delay.  We describe the interdependency associated
   with audio/video flows in detail in Section 5.

   The buffering component of the overall synchronization delay is
   driven by the way the application layer processes the payload.  In
   many multicast applications, an unreliable transport protocol such as
   UDP [RFC0768] is often used to transmit the data packets, and the
   reliability, if needed, is usually addressed through other means such
   as forward error correction and retransmission
   [I-D.ietf-rmt-pi-norm-revised].  These loss repair methods require

Internet-Draft     Rapid Synchronization for RTP Flows         July 2008


   buffering at the receiver side to function properly.  In many
   applications, it is also often necessary to de-jitter the incoming
   data packets before feeding them to the application.  The de-
   jittering process also increases the buffering delays.  Besides these
   network-related buffering delays, there are also specific buffering
   needs that are required by the individual applications.  For example,
   MPEG decoders require a significant amount of content to be available
   in the decoder buffers prior to starting to decode the content.  We
   describe these buffering requirements for audio/video applications in
   detail in Section 5.


5.  Elements of Delay in Video Systems

   For typical multicast-based video delivery systems, the multicast
   switching delay (time required to leave the previous multicast
   session and join the new session) is not the primary contributor to
   the overall synchronization delay.  The multicast flows are typically
   already present at the edge or deep in the network, the propagation
   delays for join operations are modest, and the multicast routers can
   typically process the Join and Leave messages quickly.  Even if the
   edge multicast router is not currently a member of the requested
   multicast session, the multicast routing control messages propagate
   through the network rapidly and trees are built without experiencing
   large delays.  Even in cases where a number of tree branches need to
   be built to the edge multicast router, this cost is frequently
   amortized over a large number of receivers such that only the first
   receiver joining the group experiences the increased delay.  Further,
   this delay can be eliminated at the cost of extra bandwidth in the
   network core by having the edge routers do static joins for the set
   of sessions they expect receivers to be interested in.  These
   techniques usually provide a well-bounded multicast switching delay.

   Once the join operation completes and a receiver starts receiving
   media content for the first time in a multicast session, it often
   experiences a considerable amount of key information latency and
   buffering delays.  In the following subsections, we discuss the
   details of these delay elements, using MPEG2 Transport Streams as the
   motivating use case.

5.1.  Overview of MPEG-2 Transport Streams

   MPEG2 Transport Stream (MPEG2-TS) [MPEG2TS] is an encapsulation
   method and transport that multiplexes digital video and audio
   content, together with ancillary metadata, and produces a
   synchronized multiplexed stream that is tailored for transport over
   packet or cell-oriented networks.  MPEG2-TS is ubiquitous in
   broadcast applications over both terrestrial and satellite networks.

Internet-Draft     Rapid Synchronization for RTP Flows         July 2008


   Both Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) in North America
   and Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) in Europe use MPEG2-TS in their
   standards.  MPEG2-TS has been standardized by both ISO and ITU
   [MPEG2TS].  While MPEG2-TS was originally limited to carry MPEG-2
   encoded content, the specification was later extended to cover MPEG-
   4/AVC video/audio encoding standards as well.

   MPEG2-TS is a container format that describes the schema of the audio
   and video content and the in-band control information.  Prior to
   multiplexing, an audio and a video encoder output audio and video
   Elementary Streams (ES), respectively.  The ES streams are then
   packetized to form the Packetized Elementary Streams (PES).  The
   resulting elements are called PES packets.  A transport stream (TS)
   encapsulates several PES streams and other data, and carries them in
   TS packets.  The RTP payload format for carrying TS packets in an RTP
   stream is specified in [RFC2250].  In addition to the audio and video
   ES streams, there are ES streams that carry control data.

   Program Specific Information (PSI) consists of metadata carried in
   the transport stream.  PSI includes Program Association Table (PAT),
   Conditional Access Table (CAT) and Program Map Table (PMT).  A PAT
   has information about all the programs carried in the transport
   stream.  It lists the 13-bit Program IDs (PID) for all the PMTs,
   associating them with the individual programs.  Each of the ES
   streams of a particular program in the transport stream also has the
   same PID values.  This way, a decoder at the receiving side can
   extract the desired TS packets from the transport stream by checking
   their PID values.  If the transport stream is not a Multi-Program
   Transport Stream (MPTS), but rather it is a Single-Program Transport
   Stream (SPTS), all the ES streams in the transport stream correspond
   to a single program and the PAT data is not carried.

   CAT defines the type of the scrambling used (either at the PES or TS
   level), and identifies all the PID values of the TS packets that
   contain the Entitlement Management Messages (EMM).  In addition to
   containing the PID values of each ES stream associated with a
   particular program, the PMT table also includes private data
   associated with the program such as the PID value of the packet
   containing the Entitlement Control Messages (ECM).  The data
   contained in the EMM and ECM messages are vital in descrambling
   encrypted content.  Note that PSI is carried in clear and is never
   scrambled so that a receiver which just started receiving the
   transport stream can process the PSI.  The PAT, CAT and PMT tables
   must be parsed by the decoder in order to find the ES streams,
   private data as well as the encryption information for a given
   program.

   MPEG2-TS produces output that is synchronized to a common clock

   across all the ESs in the multiplex.  To assist the audio and video
   decoders, programs periodically provide a Program Clock Reference
   (PCR) value in the transport stream.  PCR values are embedded in the
   TS adaptation field headers and are inserted by the encoder at least
   every 100 ms.  A PCR timestamp represents the value of the encoder's
   system clock when it was sampled.  The system clock is driven by a
   local 27 MHz oscillator.

   PCR is extremely important in native MPEG-2 transport to keep the
   decoders synchronized.  For example, the periodically sent Decoding
   Timestamps (DTS) and Presentation Timestamps (PTS) are specified
   relative to the PCR value and the decoders use the PCR value as the
   basis for a master clock during decoding and playout.

5.2.  Key Information Latency in Video Applications

   We classify the key information latency into two categories.

5.2.1.  PSI (PAT/CAT/PMT) Acquisition Delay

   As we discussed in Section 5.1, the video (and the audio as well) in
   an MPEG2 TS is self describing, and the receiver must parse certain
   control information in the PAT, CAT and PMT tables (i.e., PSI)
   contained in the transport stream in order to know how to parse the
   rest of the stream (i.e., to find the audio and video elementary
   streams, private data and the encryption information for a given
   program).

   Many video services employ content encryption and the encryption keys
   must be parsed as well for decrypting the content.  In order to
   enable various system elements to process video effectively, certain
   portions of the stream are left unencrypted.  The PAT/PMT tables are
   always in the clear.  The structure of the ECMs is also in the clear,
   although the ECM content which contains keying material is encrypted.
   The PSI information is repeated periodically in the transport stream,
   thus, when a receiver joins the multicast session, it needs to wait
   until the next time PSI is sent in the transport stream.

   Editor's note:  Do we need to list how frequent PSI/PCR/etc is
   repeated in ATSC and/or DVB standards?  Update:  This will be
   addressed in the next revision.

5.2.2.  Random Access Point Acquisition Delay

   Conventional MPEG2 video encoders encode the video content in Groups
   of Pictures (GoP).  Each GoP is encoded independently from other GoPs
   and starts with an intra-coded frame (I-frame) that does not have any
   reference to other frames in the same GoP, i.e., an I-frame contains



VerSteeg, et al.         Expires January 8, 2009               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft     Rapid Synchronization for RTP Flows         July 2008


   the representation of an entire picture and can be decoded
   independently.  Thus, the start of an I-frame is said to be a Random
   Access Point (RAP).

   On the other hand, due to the temporal compression, rest of the
   frames in the same GoP may have references to the I-frame or to other
   frames in the same GoP.  Due to this interdependency among the
   frames, one generally has to receive certain elements of the GoP
   prior to decoding or rendering any part of the GoP.  For example, the
   decoder can decode a frame that is dependent on two other frames only
   after these two frames are decoded.

   Usually, GoP durations are between 500 ms and one second.  However,
   more advanced codecs may use longer GoPs to gain from the encoding
   efficiency.  When a receiver joins the multicast session, it needs to
   wait until the next RAP shows up in the multicast stream before it
   can start decoding.  Since the frame that is currently being
   multicast does not depend on the join time, the average time a
   receiver waits for RAP, i.e., the average RAP acquisition delay, is
   half of the GoP duration.  Hence, for longer GoPs, the RAP
   acquisition delay is proportionally longer.

   Advanced Video Coding (AVC) (also called MPEG4 part 10) compression
   is very similar to MPEG2 compression.  It has a few more compression
   tools available, including Hierarchical GoPs.  In a hierarchical GoP,
   the dependent frames of a GoP may reference the key frame at the
   start of this GoP or the key frame at the start of the next GoP.
   This additional dependency causes a longer RAP acquisition delay, as
   the decoder must receive two I-frames (spread between two logical
   GoPs) before decoding can commence.  AVC also has the ability to
   insert Instantaneous Decoding Refresh (IDR) frames.  Frames that
   follow an IDR frame cannot reference frames that precede an IDR
   frame.  IDR frames are useful for editing AVC streams, but are
   typically do not appear often enough in streaming video to be useful
   in a stream synchronization context.

   Note that in order for an intermediary network element such as a
   retransmission server to find the random access points in the video
   stream (e.g., I-frames), the necessary structural information must be
   in the clear if the intermediary is not in possession of the
   necessary keys.

5.3.  Buffering Delays in Video Applications

   We classify the buffering delays into two categories.

5.3.1.  Network-Related Buffering Delays

   In general, multicast-based video applications use an unreliable
   underlying transport protocol such as UDP [RFC0768] to distribute the
   content to a large number of receivers.  This is largely due to the
   fact that these applications are one way in nature and providing
   closed-loop reliability does not scale well when the number of
   receivers is large or the acceptable playout delay is small, or both.
   Rather, if there is a need for reliability, the applications may
   employ one or more loss-repair methods to recover the packets missing
   at each receiver (The Reliable Multicast Transport Working Group has
   several standardized solutions for this problem.  Refer to
   [I-D.ietf-rmt-pi-norm-revised] for details).  For example, forward
   error correction (FEC) may be used proactively and/or on-demand to
   provide reliable transmission to a potentially very large multicast
   group in a scalable manner [I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework].  Similarly,
   retransmissions may be used in RTP-based SSM sessions where the
   retransmissions can be handled by local repair servers rather than
   the source itself [I-D.ietf-avt-rtcpssm].  However, regardless of the
   type of the loss-repair method(s) adopted by an application, loss-
   recovery operations always require additional buffering at the
   receiver side.  The amount of buffering increases with the FEC block
   size when FEC is used, and with the round-trip time between the
   receiver and the local repair server when retransmission is used.

   Audio and video decoders demand almost jitter-free content.  If any
   jitter is introduced during the transmission in the network or due to
   the loss repair methods, the jitter has to be smoothed out before the
   content is fed to the decoder.  This is called de-jittering and it
   usually adds up to the buffering delay.

5.3.2.  Application-Related Buffering Delays

   The application buffering requirements for MPEG-encoded content are
   quite rigorous, particularly for the MPEG-based video applications.
   Video compression devices apply more bits to represent certain scenes
   than they do for other scenes.  A very complex scene (individual
   picture) requires considerably more information than a simple scene.
   Furthermore, pictures that are entirely intra-coded, e.g., I-frames,
   consume more bits compared to pictures that make use of predictive
   coding.  Each scene is shown by the decoder at a certain fixed frame
   rate (e.g., 24 fps or 30 fps).  Since some scenes are comprised more
   bits than other scenes, the output rate of the decoder buffer is
   usually variable.  However, the network flow is typically Constant
   Bit Rate (CBR) or Capped Variable Bit Rate (Capped VBR).  The net
   effect is that the input rate to the decoder buffer is close to
   constant, but the output rate is highly variable.

Internet-Draft     Rapid Synchronization for RTP Flows         July 2008


   The video encoders keep track of the decoder buffer size, and use
   this information to regulate the temporal compression.  This forces
   the decoder buffer to "breathe."  In order to avoid underflow, the
   decoder buffer must fill up to a certain level prior to starting to
   decode and play the content.  The decoder buffer size required to
   avoid underflow is dependent on the encoder, and the encoder signals
   the decoder buffering requirements in-band.  Typical decoder buffer
   requirements for MPEG2 content range from one second to two seconds.
   However, AVC/MPEG4 part 10 encoders usually tend to use more temporal
   compression, and thus require a larger buffer at the decoder side.
   This consequently increases the buffering delays.

5.4.  Breakdown of Typical Synchronization Delays in IPTV

   Editor's note:  This section will provide typical ranges for each of
   the delay components based on our observations in the field.  This
   section is for educational and illustrative purposes.


6.  Rapid Synchronization

   The video systems we consider as a use case in this document
   encapsulate multicast video flows in an IP/UDP/RTP/MPEG2-TS/<codec>
   format.  Typical codecs include MPEG2 and AVC/MPEG4 part 10, although
   other codecs are also in use.  The IP and UDP wrappers are well
   understood and ubiquitous.  Many legacy video deployments do not use
   RTP encapsulation.  However, in order to use the rapid
   synchronization method specified in this document, RTP encapsulation
   is clearly required.

   We start this section with an overview of the rapid synchronization
   method.

6.1.  Overview

   RTP [RFC3550], together with [RFC4588] and [RFC4585] provide the
   mechanisms needed to encapsulate a data flow and use RTCP feedback to
   implement a robust error-recovery mechanism for that flow.  When
   packets are lost, a receiver may use RTCP NACK messages to request
   retransmission of those packets using RTP retransmission packets.

   In order to achieve rapid synchronization, the receiver can use this
   retransmission mechanism to request all of the data from the most
   recent RAP.  We therefore employ a new RTP/RTCP-based mechanism that
   boils down to "I do not have synchronization with the stream.  Send
   me a repair burst that will cover all of the required data from a
   recent RAP to the point the stream has reached in the multicast
   session."  Note that the rapid synchronization flow and the normal



VerSteeg, et al.         Expires January 8, 2009               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft     Rapid Synchronization for RTP Flows         July 2008


   repair flow share the same RTP session.

   In order to reduce the synchronization delay associated with
   processing a new RTP encapsulated multicast flow, either the media
   source may retain the stream state, and/or a Retransmission Server
   (RS) may cache that flow near the egress edge and provide an
   accelerated unicast burst to the requesting receiver.  Which element
   performs these functions depends on the desired scale of the system.
   The protocol machinery is agnostic to the difference, as both use the
   RTCP feedback target address as the way to identify the element
   performing these functions.

   Where a Retransmission Server (RS) is employed, it semi-permanently
   joins the multicast session and receives the RTP steams it wishes to
   cache so that it can perform the retransmission functions.  For the
   rapid synchronization support, RS parses the incoming flows, looking
   for the key information.  The key information may be segregated by RS
   into two components - the key information that occurs in sequence
   with the RTP data and that which does not occur in RTP sequence
   order.

   When acquiring an RTP session, the RTP Receiver (RR) sends an RTCP
   message to the feedback target requesting an accelerated burst of
   data from the multicast session via unicast including any key
   information that occurs in sequence with the RTP data plus any
   optional key information that does not occur in RTP sequence order.

   In the case of IP/UDP/RTP/MPEG2-TS encapsulated video streams, the
   key information that may not occur in the RTP sequence order may
   consist of the information required to demultiplex and decode the
   MPEG2 TS.  We refer to this information as the Transport Stream
   Random Access Point (TSRAP).  The TSRAP information includes the PAT,
   PMT, PCR and optionally the ECMs.  The TSRAP information can be
   either provided in the unicast burst to RR or it is sent from the
   feedback target to RR in an RTCP packet.

   The sequential key information, on the other hand, (i.e., the PES
   header, I-frame and subsequent data) is always sent in the unicast
   RTP flow, using the RTP retransmission payload format.  This has
   several advantages, including easy correlation between the packets in
   the RTP session carrying the unicast burst and those of the multicast
   session, and the ability of the receiver to utilize the same
   algorithms for reception and processing the key information as it
   does for dealing with RTP retransmissions during the normal session
   operation.

   The RTP data is sent from the feedback target to the receiver
   starting with the sequential key information via unicast as described



VerSteeg, et al.         Expires January 8, 2009               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft     Rapid Synchronization for RTP Flows         July 2008


   above.  The MPEG data sent in the unicast burst starts with an
   Elementary Stream Random Access Point (ESRAP).  This includes a PES
   header containing a PTS, followed by a sequence header, followed by
   an I-frame.  The unicast burst continues at a higher than natural
   rate until the unicast burst catches up with the real-time multicast
   flow.

6.2.  Message flows and State Machines

   The flow diagram for unicast-based rapid synchronization is sketched
   in Figure 2.  In this figure, we have an RTP Sender and an RTP
   Receiver (RR).  The rapid synchronization support is provided in this
   scenario by a Retransmission Server (RS), although the message flows
   are identical to the case where the rapid synchronization is
   performed by a feedback target co-located with the media source.
   Note that [I-D.ietf-avt-rtcpssm] permits the feedback target to be a
   retransmission server, since it is a logical function to which RRs
   send their unicast feedback.

   Editor's note:  In Figure 2, not all messages are shown.  The flow
   diagram will be revised and improved in the next revision.

      Figure 2: Flow diagram for unicast-based rapid synchronization

   The following steps describe rapid synchronization in detail:

   1.  RR sends an IGMP Leave message [RFC3376] to its upstream
       multicast router to leave the current multicast session.

   2.  RR sends an RTCP packet that contains a NACK PLI message
       [RFC4585] for the new multicast RTP session to the feedback
       target address of that session.  [RFC4585] specifies that the
       packet type for a payload-specific feedback message to be 206 and
       the feedback message type to be 1.  The RTCP packet contains the
       SSRC of RR and the SSRC of the media source.  Note that since no
       RTP packets have yet been received for this session, the SSRC
       must be obtained out-of-band or in-band.  For sessions described
       using SDP [RFC4566], the SSRC MUST be signaled using the 'ssrc'
       attribute of the media description (The 'cname' source attribute
       MUST also be present [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-source-attributes]).

       RR may also send an RTCP APP packet that specifies the minimum
       amount of data it requires from RS and optionally the maximum
       amount of data it can receive from RS (Note that this APP packet
       is usually sent in a compound RTCP packet that also includes the
       NACK PLI message).  This information is used by RS to prepare a
       rapid synchronization that conforms with RR's buffer
       requirements.  The format of this APP packet is described in
       Appendix A.  As an alternative to the APP packet, a new RTCP
       transport-layer feedback message [RFC4585] called Rapid Multicast
       Synchronization Request (RMS-R) could also be defined.  This
       message may contain the buffer sizing information of RR in its
       feedback control information field.

   3.  RS receives the NACK PLI and APP packets, and decides whether to
       accept the rapid synchronization request or not.  If RS accepts
       the request, it sends an RTCP packet to RR that comprises fields
       that can be used to describe the burst that RS will generate and
       send, including the indication when RR should switch to the
       multicast stream.  This RTCP message is referred to as the Rapid
       Multicast Synchronization Information (RMS-I).  For the RMS-I
       message, Appendix A defines an RTCP APP packet format and
       Appendix B defines a new RTCP message.  The RMS-I message may be
       sent multiple times towards RR.  Note that RS learns the IP
       address and port information for RR from the RTCP NACK PLI or
       RMS-R packet it received.  (This description glosses over the NAT
       details.  Refer to Section 8 for a discussion of NAT-related
       issues.)

       If RS cannot provide a unicast rapid synchronization session, RS



VerSteeg, et al.         Expires January 8, 2009               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft     Rapid Synchronization for RTP Flows         July 2008


       rejects the request and informs RR immediately via the RMS-I
       message.  If RR receives RMS-I indicating that the rapid
       synchronization request has been denied, it abandons the rapid
       synchronization attempt and immediately joins the RTP multicast
       session by sending an IGMP Join message [RFC3376] to its upstream
       multicast router for the new multicast session.

   4.  If RS accepts the rapid synchronization request, it transmits (in
       addition to the RMS-I message) the unicast RTP burst data and any
       additional RTCP APP message(s) that may contain key information
       (TSRAP) that is not provided in the unicast RTP burst.  The RTCP
       RMS-I message is either sent prior to the data burst or during
       the data burst, with the appropriate value settings in its
       fields.

   5.  At the appropriate moment (as indicated or computed from the
       burst parameters in the RTCP packet), RR sends an IGMP Join
       message [RFC3376] to its upstream multicast router for the new
       RTP multicast session.

   6.  RR starts receiving the multicast RTP flow.

   7.  If RS had not explicitly indicated the size of the unicast burst
       in the RMS-I message, RR can be asked in the RMS-I message to
       explicitly indicate to RS when multicast synchronization has been
       completed which triggers RS to stop the unicast burst.  To this
       effect, a new RTCP message called Rapid Multicast Synchronization
       Process Termination (RMS-T) is to be defined.  This may be a new
       transport-layer feedback RTCP message [RFC4585] that may be
       transmitted more than once by RR for redundancy reasons.
       Alternatively, an RTCP BYE message can be used to make RS stop
       the unicast burst.

   Note that when RR joins the multicast session, RR may receive the
   same packet from both the multicast session and unicast burst.  The
   impact of this and measures that can be taken to minimize the impact
   of receiving duplicate packets will be addressed in Section 6.4.

   It is possible that RR may decide to switch to a new multicast
   session while an earlier rapid synchronization request is still
   pending or active.  In that case, RR SHOULD cancel the pending/active
   rapid synchronization operation before it sends a new request for the
   new multicast session.  To cancel the pending request and stop any
   existing rapid synchronization operation, RR SHOULD send an RTCP BYE
   packet for the unicast retransmission session.  Upon receiving an
   RTCP BYE packet, RS MUST terminate the rapid synchronization
   operation, and cease transmitting any further packets of the
   associated unicast burst.  Note that in addition to the RTCP BYE



VerSteeg, et al.         Expires January 8, 2009               [Page 18]

Internet-Draft     Rapid Synchronization for RTP Flows         July 2008


   packet in the unicast session, an RTCP BYE packet MUST also be sent
   for the session associated with the multicast source stream if RR
   already joined the multicast session.

   Against the possibility of the RTCP BYE packet being lost and thus
   failing to stop the rapid synchronization operation, RR MAY send
   multiple BYE packets for the unicast session as long as it follows
   the RTCP timer rules of [RFC3550].

6.3.  Encoding of the Signaling Protocol

   Editor's note:  This section discusses the format of the control
   packets that are exchanged to support rapid synchronization.
   Currently, there are two proposals.  These proposals are explained in
   Appendix A and Appendix B.  Based on the discussion in the WG, we
   will adopt one of these proposals, or a hybrid of the two.

7.  Session Description Protocol (SDP) Signaling

   This section provides an SDP [RFC4566] example for enabling rapid
   synchronization with RTP multicast sessions.  The following example
   uses the SDP grouping semantics [RFC3388], the RTP/AVPF profile
   [RFC4585], the RTP retransmissions [RFC4588], the RTCP extensions for
   SSM sessions with unicast feedback [I-D.ietf-avt-rtcpssm] and the
   source-specific media attributes
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-source-attributes].

   In the example, we have two primary source streams and two unicast
   retransmission streams for each of these source streams.  The source



VerSteeg, et al.         Expires January 8, 2009               [Page 19]

Internet-Draft     Rapid Synchronization for RTP Flows         July 2008


   streams are multicast from a distribution source (with a source IP
   address of 8.166.1.1) in different multicast groups.  For each source
   stream, a feedback target address (9.30.30.1) is also specified with
   the 'rtcp' attribute.  The receiver(s) can report missing packets on
   the source stream to the feedback target and request retransmissions.
   The parameter 'rtx-time' specifies the time in milliseconds (measured
   from the time a packet was first sent) that the sender (in this case
   the feedback target) keeps an RTP packet in its buffers available for
   retransmission.

   For the first source stream, only the conventional retransmission
   support is enabled.  For the second source stream, both the
   conventional retransmission and rapid synchronization support is
   enabled.  This is achieved by the "a=rtcp-fb:98 nack pli" line.  The
   parameter 'pli' denotes a payload-specific feedback message and
   stands for Picture Loss Indication [RFC4585].

   When a receiver requires rapid synchronization for a new multicast
   session it wants to join, it sends an RTCP NACK PLI message to the
   feedback target.  This RTCP packet has to have the SSRC of the
   primary source session for which rapid synchronization is requested
   for.  However, since this receiver has not received any RTP packets
   from this primary source session yet, the receiver MUST learn the
   SSRC value from the 'ssrc' attribute of the media description
   [I-D.ietf-avt-rtcpssm].  In addition to the SSRC value, the 'cname'
   source attribute MUST also be present in the SDP description
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-source-attributes].  Note that listing the SSRC
   values for the primary source sessions in the SDP file does not
   create a problem in SSM sessions when an SSRC collision occurs.  This
   is because in SSM sessions, a receiver that observed an SSRC
   collision with a media source MUST change its own SSRC
   [I-D.ietf-avt-rtcpssm] by following the rules defined in [RFC3550].

   A feedback target that receives a NACK PLI feedback message becomes
   aware that the prediction chain at the receiver side has been broken
   or does not exist any more.  If the necessary conditions are
   satisfied (as outlined in Section 7 of [RFC4585]) and available
   resources exist, the feedback target MAY react to the NACK PLI
   message by sending the key information and an intra update.

8.  NAT Considerations

   TBC.


9.  Open Source RTP Receiver Implementation

   An open source RTP Receiver code that implements the functionalities
   introduced in this document is available at the following URL:

   http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/video/cds/cda/vqe/2_0/user/guide/
   ch1_over.html

   The code is also available at:

   ftp://ftpeng.cisco.com/ftp/vqec/


10.  Open Issues

   o  Do we need a new RTCP XR [RFC3611] block type for reporting the
      performance of rapid synchronization?

   o  Do we need a new nack parameter for indicating rapid
      synchronization support for non-video streams in an SDP?  PLI is
      mostly meaningful in video applications.


11.  Security Considerations

   TBC.


12.  IANA Considerations

   This document will register new RTCP packet types.

Appendix A.  Protocol Encoding Option #A

   [RFC3550] specifies the format of the RTCP APP packets as depicted in
   Figure 6.  In an RTCP APP packet, the payload type MUST be set to
   204.  The Subtype field is used to allow a set of APP packets to be
   defined under one unique name or for any application-dependent data.
   The Name field is chosen by the person defining the APP packets and
   it MUST be unique among the APP packets the intended application
   might receive.  The Application-dependent data field contains the
   information (at a length of in multiples of 32 bits) to be
   interpreted by the intended application (not RTP itself).  [RFC3550]
   specifies that RTP receivers SHOULD ignore the APP packets with
   unrecognized names.

                  Figure 6: Format of an RTCP APP packet

   Section 6.7 of [RFC3550] and [I-D.ott-avt-rtcp-guidelines] state that
   RTCP APP packets are intended for experimental use and they are not
   appropriate to be registered in a standards document.  Thus, as part
   of the standardization process of this specification, we are planning
   to convert the APP packets into standardized RTCP packet types and
   register them with IANA.  This will promote interoperability among
   different implementations.

   The data is encoded in the Application-dependent data field by using
   Type/Length/Value (TLV) elements.

   o  Type:  A single-octet identifier that defines the type of the
      parameter represented in this TLV element.

   o  Length:  A two-octet field that indicates the length of the Value
      field.

   o  Value:  Variable sized set of octets that contains the specific
      value for the parameter.

   Note that all multi-octet values are in network-byte order.

   The following TLV elements are defined in this document:

A.1.  Padding

   This type has no Length or Value fields.  It is to pad the
   Application-dependent data field to a multiple of 32-bit words
   [RFC3550].

Internet-Draft     Rapid Synchronization for RTP Flows         July 2008


   Type      Length Value
   iana_tlv1 -      -

A.2.  RTP Sequence Number for the First Rapid Synchronization Packet

   This is the RTP sequence number of the first packet that will be sent
   as part of the rapid synchronization.  This allows RR to know if one
   or more packets are dropped at the beginning of rapid
   synchronization.

   Type      Length Value
   iana_tlv2 4      32-bit extended RTP sequence number

   32-bit extended RTP sequence number is constructed by putting the 16-
   bit RTP sequence number in the lower two bytes and octet 0's in the
   higher two bytes.

A.3.  Earliest IGMP Join Time

   This is time difference (in RTP clock ticks) between the start of
   rapid synchronization and the earliest time instant when RR could
   join the new multicast session.

   Type      Length Value
   iana_tlv3 4      32-bit delta time in RTP clock ticks

A.4.  Rapid Synchronization End Time

   This is time difference (in RTP clock ticks) between the end of the
   first packet sent in rapid synchronization and the time instant when
   rapid synchronization will end.

   Type      Length Value
   iana_tlv4 4      32-bit delta time in RTP clock ticks

A.5.  TSRAP Data

   Description.

   Type      Length Value
   iana_tlv5 N      Encoded TSRAP data

   Editor's note:  This section should define the TLV elements for the
   TSRAP data.

A.6.  Actual Rapid Synchronization Fill

   This is the amount of backfill that RR can expect in its buffer as a
   result of the rapid synchronization (in ms).

   Type      Length Value
   iana_tlv6 4      Amount of rapid synchronization fill in ms

A.7.  Join-Time Rapid Synchronization Fill

   This is the amount of backfill that RR can expect in its buffer as a
   result of the rapid synchronization at the time of the earliest IGMP
   Join (in ms).

Type      Length Value
iana_tlv7 4      Amount of rapid synchronization fill at IGMP Join in ms


Appendix B.  Protocol Encoding Option #B

B.1.  RMS-R RTCP Message Format

   This is an RTCP transport-layer feedback message [RFC4585].

   The fields are set as follows:

   FMT field:  2

   FCI field:

   4-byte field:  Amount of rapid synchronization fill in milliseconds.

B.2.  RMS-I RTCP Message Format

   This is similar to the RTCP transport-layer feedback message
   [RFC4585] but with a new payload type.

   FCI comprises:

   2-byte field:  RTP sequence number for the first rapid
   synchronization packet.

   4-byte field:  Earliest IGMP join time.  All zeroes means not
   specified.

   4-byte field:  Rapid synchronization end time.  All zeroes means not
   specified.

   1-byte field:  IGMP join time now.  This can only have value 0 or 1;
   1 = time to join multicast is now.  If 1, then previous 2 fields MUST
   be all zeroes.

   1-byte field:  RS response.  This can only have value 0 or 1 or 2; 0
   = RS will not service rapid synchronization request. 1 = RS services
   rapid synchronization request; RR MUST NOT issue RMS-T message when
   multicast is received. 2 = RS services rapid synchronization request;
   RR MUST issue RMS-T message when multicast is received.

   The RMS-I message may be sent multiple times at the start or prior to
   the RTP unicast burst, or during the RTP unicast burst.

B.3.  RMS-T RTCP Message Format

   FMT field:  3

   FCI field:

   2-byte packet identifier field:  Contains the sequence number of the
   first received RTP packet of the multicast stream.
