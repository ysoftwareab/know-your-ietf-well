EXT_NOP=0     No-Operation extension.
              The information present in this extension field MUST be

EXT_AUTH=1    Packet authentication extension
              Information used to authenticate the sender of the packet.
              The format of this Header Extension and its processing is
              outside the scope of this document and is to be
              communicated out-of-band as part of the Session
              Description.
              It is RECOMMENDED that senders provide some form of packet
              authentication.  If EXT_AUTH is present, whatever packet
              authentication checks that can be performed immediately
              upon reception of the packet SHOULD be performed before
              accepting the packet and performing any congestion
              control-related action on it.
              Some packet authentication schemes impose a delay of
              several seconds between when a packet is received and when
              the packet is fully authenticated.  Any congestion control
              related action that is appropriate MUST NOT be postponed
              by any such full packet authentication.

              of this Header Extension and its processing is outside the
              scope of this document and is to be communicated out-of-
              band as part of the Session Description.
