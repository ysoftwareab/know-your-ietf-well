Abstract

   In the current S/MIME Version 3.1 specification, the header
   protection is achieved by encoding the whole message as a
   message/rfc822 MIME object. Since this approach poses some practical
   problems, we propose to use signed attributes to implement a fully
   backward compatible S/MIME header protection scheme.

Internet-Draft          Header Protection for S/MIME          April 2008


1.  Introduction

   Mail message header fields as defined in [RFC2822] contain security
   critical information that is not protected cryptographically. The
   only exception is the header fields From and Sender. Receiving
   agents MUST check that the address in the header field From or Sender
   of a mail message matches an Internet mail address, if present, in
   the signer's certificate, if mail addresses are present in the
   certificate.  A receiving agent SHOULD provide some explicit
   alternate processing of the message if this comparison fails, which
   may be to display a message that shows the recipient the addresses
   in the certificate or other certificate details [RFC3850]. Other
   header fields like "To", "Date", "Reply-To" and "Subject" remain
   totally unprotected.

   In the solution described in this specification, a digest value is
   computed over the canonicalized version of some selected header
   fields. This technique resembles header protection in [RFC4871].
   Then the digest value is included in a signed attribute field of a
   CMS signature.

   This solution allows conforming clients to check if one of the
   selected header fields has been altered by simply re-computing the
   digest value. Non-conforming legacy clients will simply ignore that
   the signed attribute contains a digest value, and will only check the
   digest value computed over the message body according to S/MIME.

   By including separate signed attributes for different header fields,
   each field can be protected separately.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Syntactic Notation

   The following tokens are imported from other RFCs as noted.  Those
   RFCs should be considered definitive.

   The following tokens are imported from [RFC2822]:

   o  "field-name" (name of a header field)

   Other tokens not defined herein are imported from [RFC4234].  These
   are intuitive primitives such as SP, HTAB, WSP, ALPHA, DIGIT, CRLF,
   etc.

1.3.  Object Identifiers

   The object identifiers defined in this specification is only for the
   experiment. When this memo moves to standards track within the IETF,
   it is intended that the IANA will maintain this registry.

1.4.  Security Goals of Header Protection

   The main security goal of mail message header protection is not to
   protect the whole RFC 2822 header against manipulation, but to make
   it possible for the receiving client to detect which headers have
   been changed.

1.5.  Header Protection in S/MIME Version 3.1

   S/MIME Version 3.1 [RFC3851] addresses the header protection by
   including all header fields as generated by the sending mail client,
   together with the body of the message, in a message/rfc822 mime
   object, which can then be protected by S/MIME. It is up to the
   receiving client to decide how to present this message to the user.

   This approach has, however, some limitations: If some of the message
   headers are changed during transport (e.g. when sent to a mailing
   list), this will either invalidate the whole message, or not be
   detected at all, depending on the receiving mail client's behavior.

   This approach has the following disadvantages:

     o  All inner header fields must also appear in the outer header
        (i.e., those headers must be presented doubly) so that the mail
        message is conform to [RFC2822] and the mail server and relay
        systems know how to send the mail message.

     o  Only the inner header fields are protected, but not the outer
        header fields. As stated in [RFC3851], it is up to the receiving
        client to decide how to present the inner header along with the
        unprotected outer header. Usually the following header fields, 
        if present, are shown in most clients: "From", "Sender", "To", 
        "CC", "Date", and "Subject". If the same header field is present
        in both inner and outer header, only the one in the inner header
        is presented. If a header field is only presented in the outer 
        header, it will be also shown. Most mail messages do not contain
        the headers "Sender" and "CC", hence one can add these header
        fields in the outer header to confuse the receivers.

     o  It complicates the receiver to show the mail message. It is
        difficult to determine whether the message within the
        message/rfc822 wrapper is the top-level message or the complete
        message/rfc822 MIME entity is another encapsulated mail message.

1.6.  Prototype Implementation
  
   A prototype implementation of this memo is available in [FeLi08]. When
   this memo moves to standards track within the IETF, this section will 
   be removed.

2.  S/MIME Header Protection Entity

   A smime header protection entity contains names of header fields to
   be protected, the canonicalization algorithm, the digest algorithm
   and the corresponding digest value.

2.1.  Fieldname List

   The fieldname-list is a colon-separated list of header field names
   that identify the header fields presented to the digest algorithm; it
   is defined as follows:

      fieldname-list  = field-name *(":" field-name)

   The fieldname-list MUST contain the complete list of header fields in
   the order presented to the digest algorithm. The field MAY contain
   names of header fields that do not exist when digested; nonexistent
   header fields do not contribute to the digest value computation (that
   is, they are treated as the null input, including the header field
   name, the separating colon, the header field value, and any CRLF
   terminator).

   The fieldname-list is compared against actual header field names in a
   case insensitive manner.

   Signers choosing to protect an existing header field that occurs more
   than once in the message (such as "Resent-From") MUST protect the
   physically last instance of that header field in the header block.
   Signers wishing to protect multiple instances of such a header field
   MUST include the header field name multiple times and MUST protect
   such header fields in order from the bottom of the header field block
   to the top. The signer MAY include more instances of a header field
   name than there are actual corresponding header fields to indicate
   that additional header fields of that name SHOULD NOT be added.

Internet-Draft          Header Protection for S/MIME          April 2008


     INFORMATIVE EXAMPLE:

     Given a mail message as follows:
       Resent-From: A <CRLF>
       Resent-From: B <CRLF>
       From: C <CRLF>
       To: D <CRLF>
       CC: E <CRLF>
       Subject: F <CRLF>

       Body

     If the signer wishes to sign the header fields "To", "CC", "From",
     and "Subject" in that order, then the fieldname-list is:

       To:CC:From:Subject

     and the following header fields will be digested in the order:

       To: D <CRLF>
       CC: E <CRLF>
       From: C <CRLF>
       Subject: F <CRLF>

     If the signer wishes to protect the header fields "To", "CC",
     "From", "Subject", and the "Resent-From" header field with the
     value B, then the fieldname-list is:

       To:CC:From:Subject:Resent-From

     and the following header fields will be digested in the order:

       To: D <CRLF>
       CC: E <CRLF>
       From:C <CRLF>
       Subject:F <CRLF>
       Resent-From: B <CRLF>

     If the signer wishes to protect the header fields "To", "CC",
     "From", "Subject", and both "Resent-From" header fields, and wishes
     to prevent from adding new "Resent-From" header field, then the
     fieldname-list is:

       To:CC:From:Subject:Resent-From:Resent-From:Resent-From

Internet-Draft          Header Protection for S/MIME          April 2008


     and the following header fields will be digested in the order:

       To: D <CRLF>
       CC: E <CRLF>
       From: C <CRLF>
       Subject: F <CRLF>
       Resent-From: B <CRLF>
       Resent-From: A <CRLF>

     If the receiving agents receives the message with a third
     Resent-From: G that is inserted before Resent-From: A, then the
     following header fields will be used to verify S/MIME header
     protection entity:

       To: D <CRLF>
       CC: E <CRLF>
       From: C <CRLF>
       Subject: F <CRLF>
       Resent-From: B <CRLF>
       Resent-From: A <CRLF>
       Resent-From: G <CRLF>

     then the verification fails.

   Signers should be careful of digesting header fields that might have
   additional instances added later in the delivery process, since such
   header fields might be inserted after the digested instance or
   otherwise reordered. Trace header fields (such as "Received") and
   Resent-* blocks are the only fields prohibited by [RFC2822] from
   being reordered.

      INFORMATIVE ADMONITION:  Despite the fact that [RFC2822] permits
      header fields to be reordered (with the exception of Received
      header fields), reordering of digested header fields with multiple
      instances by intermediate MTAs will cause S/MIME header protection
      entity in this specification to be broken; such anti-social
      behavior should be avoided.

      INFORMATIVE IMPLEMENTER'S NOTE:  Although not required by this
      specification, all end-user visible header fields should be
      digested to avoid possible "indirect spamming".  For example, if
      the "Subject" header field is not digested, a spammer can resend
      a previously digested mail, replacing the legitimate subject with
      a one-line spam.

2.2.  Canonicalization of Headers

   Mail message, specially the mail message header, may be modified by
   some mail servers and relay systems. Some signers may demand that any


Liao & Schwenk           Expires October 19, 2008               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          Header Protection for S/MIME          April 2008


   modification of the mail message header result in a signature
   failure, while some other signers may accept modification of the
   header within the bounds of mail message standards such as [RFC2822].

   To satisfy all requirements, two canonicalization algorithms are
   defined for each of the header and the body: a "simple" algorithm
   stated in Section 3.4.1 of [RFC4871] that tolerates almost no
   modification and a "relaxed" algorithm stated in Section 3.4.2 of
   [RFC4871] that tolerates common modifications such as white-space
   replacement and header field line re-wrapping.

3.  CMS Fields

3.1.  CanonAlgorithmIdentifier

   The CanonAlgorithmIdentifier type identifies a canonicalization 
   algorithm. Examples include "simple" header canonicalization, and
   "relaxed" header canonicalization.

      CanonAlgorithmIdentifier ::= AlgorithmIdentifier

   AlgorithmIdentifier is defined in [RFC3280] as follows:

      AlgorithmIdentifier  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
        algorithm               OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
        parameters              ANY DEFINED BY algorithm OPTIONAL  }

   The algorithm identifier is used to identify a canonicalization
   algorithm.

   The "simple" canonicalization algorithm is identified by the
   following object:

     id-alg-simpleHeaderCanon OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {iso(1)
        member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs-9(9)
        smime(16) alg(3) 101}


   The "relaxed" canonicalization algorithm is identified by the
   following object:

     id-alg-relaxedHeaderCanon OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {iso(1)
        member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs-9(9)
        smime(16) alg(3) 102}

   For the canonicalization algorithms "simple" and "relaxed" the
   parameters field is NULL.

Internet-Draft          Header Protection for S/MIME          April 2008


3.2.  SMIME Header Protection

   The smime-header-protection attribute type specifies the S/MIME
   header protection entity. It MUST be a signed attribute or an
   authenticated attribute; it MUST NOT be an unsigned attribute,
   unauthenticated attribute, or unprotected attribute in CMS signature.

   The following object identifier identifies the
   smime-header-protection attribute:

     id-smimeHeaderProtection OBJECT IDENTIFIER :: = {iso(1)
        member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs-9(9)
        smime(16) aa(2) 101}

   The attrValues of the smime-header-protection attribute contains 
   only one value that has ASN.1 type SMIMEHeaderProtectionEntity:

   SMIMEHeaderProtectionEntity ::= SEQUENCE {
       canonAlgorithm       CanonAlgorithmIdentifier,
       digestAlgorithm      DigestAlgorithmIdentifier,
       headerfieldNames     PrintableString,
       digest               Digest
   }

   The canonAlgorithm field specifies the canonicalization algorithm.
   The digestAlgorithm field specifies the digest algorithm. The format
   of an headerfieldNames is a "headername-list" field specified in
   Section 2.1. The headerfieldNames field specifies the list of
   header field names. The digest field carries the the digest value.

4.  Creating Signed S/MIME Messages with Header Protection

   The signed S/MIME messages with header protection are created same as
   in [RFC3851] except the followings: 

     o  Before computing the digest value over the signedAttrs, the
        smime-header-protection attribute MUST be prepared (see Section
        4.1) and added to the signedAttrs.

     o  All header fields that are protected MUST be prepared before the
        preparing the smime-header-protection.

4.1.  Preparing an SMIME-Header-Protection Attribute

   An smime-header-protection attribute is prepared as follows:

   Step 1. Choose the canonicalization algorithm, the digest algorithm,
   and the list of names of message header fields to be digested. The
   digest algorithm SHOULD be the same as the digest algorithm in the


Liao & Schwenk           Expires October 19, 2008               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft          Header Protection for S/MIME          April 2008


   SignerInfo which the smime-header-protection attribute should be
   added to.

   Step 2. Retrieve the message header fields from the message according
   to the protected header fields from Step 1.

   Step 3. Canonicalize the retrieved header fields from Step 2
   according to the canonicalization algorithm.

   Step 4. Compute the digest value over the canonicalization result in
   Step 3 according to the digest algorithm.

   Step 5. Create an smime-header-protection attribute. Store the chosen
   canonicalization algorithm, the digest algorithm, and the list of
   names from Step 1 in ASN.1 fields canonAlgorithm, digestAlgorithm,
   and headerfieldNames, respectively. Store the digest value from Step
   4 in the ASN.1 field digest.

5.  Verifying Signed S/MIME Message with Header Protection

   The signed S/MIME message with header protection are verified first
   same as in [RFC3851], then the smime-header-protection attribute is
   verified as stated in Section 5.1.

5.1.  Verifying an SMIME-Header-Protection Attribute

   An smime-header-protection attribute is verified as follows:

   Step 1. Retrieve the canonicalization algorithm, the digest
   algorithm, and the list of names of message header fields, and the
   digest value from the smime-header-protection attribute.

   Step 2. Retrieve the message header fields from the message according
   to the protected header fields from Step 1.

   Step 3. Canonicalize the retrieved header fields from Step 2
   according to the canonicalization algorithm.

   Step 4. Compute the digest value over the canonicalization result in
   Step 3 according to the digest algorithm.

   Step 5. Compares the computed digest value from Step 4 and the stored
   one from Step 1. If both digest values are different, then the
   verification fails; otherwise the verification successes.

6.  Security Considerations

   All security considerations from [RFC3851] and [RFC3852] apply to
   applications that use procedures described in this document.
