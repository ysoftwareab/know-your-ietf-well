Abstract

   This document specifies the behavioral properties required of the 
   Network Address Translator (NAT) devices in conjunction with the
   Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP). The objective of this
   memo is to make NAT devices more predictable and compatible with
   diverse application protocols that traverse the devices. Companion
   documents provide behavioral recommendations specific to TCP, UDP
   and other protocols.

1. Introduction and Scope

   As pointed out in RFC 3424 [UNSAF], NAT implementations vary
   widely in terms of how they handle different traffic. The purpose
   of this document is to define a specific set of requirements for NAT
   behavior with regard to ICMP messages. The objective is to reduce
   the unpredictability and brittleness the NAT devices (NATs)
   introduce. This document is an adjunct to [BEH-UDP], [BEH-TCP], and
   other protocol-specific BEHAVE document(s) in the future which
   define requirements for NATs when handling protocol-specific
   traffic.

   The requirements of this specification apply to Traditional NATs as
   described in [NAT-TRAD]. Traditional NAT has two variations, namely,

Internet-Draft    NAT Behavioral Requirements for ICMP     November 2008


   Basic NAT and Network Address Port Translator (NAPT). Of these, NAPT
   is by far the most commonly deployed NAT device. NAPT allows
   multiple private hosts to share a single public IP address
   simultaneously.

   This document only covers the ICMP aspects of NAT traversal, 
   specifically the traversal of ICMP Query messages and ICMP Error
   messages. Traditional NAT inherently mandates firewall-like
   filtering behavior [BEH-UDP]. However, firewall functionality in
   general or any other middlebox functionality is out of the scope
   of this document.

   In some cases, ICMP Message traversal behavior on a NAT device may 
   be overridden by local administrative policies. Some administrators
   may choose to entirely prohibit forwarding of ICMP Error messages
   across a NAT device. Some others may choose to prohibit ICMP Query
   based applications across a NAT device. These are local policies
   and not within the scope of this document. For this reason, some
   of the ICMP requirements listed in the document are preceded with a
   constraint of local policy permitting. 

   This document focuses strictly on the behavior of the NAT device,
   and not on the behavior of applications that traverse NATs. 
   Application designers may refer [BEH-APP] and [ICE] for
   recommendations and guidelines on how to make applications work
   robustly over NATs that follow the requirements specified here and
   the adjunct protocol-specific BEHAVE documents.

   Per [RFC1812], ICMP is a control protocol that is considered to be
   an integral part of IP, although it is architecturally layered upon
   IP - it uses IP to carry its data end-to-end. As such, many of the
   ICMP behavioral requirements discussed in this document apply to all
   IP protocols. 

   In case a requirement in this document conflicts with 
   protocol-specific BEHAVE requirement(s), protocol-specific BEHAVE
   documents will take precedence. The authors are not aware of any
   conflicts between this and any other IETF document at the time of
   this writing. 

   Section 2 describes the terminology used throughout the document.
   Sections 3 is focused on requirements concerning ICMP Query based
   applications traversing a NAT device. Sections 4 and 5 describe
   requirements concerning ICMP Error messages traversing a NAT
   device. Sections 6 and 7 describe requirements concerning ICMP Error
   messages generated by a NAT device. Section 8 summarizes all the
   requirements in one place. Section 9 has a discussion on security
   considerations.

2. Terminology

   Definitions for majority of the NAT terms used throughout the
   document may be found in [NAT-TERM] and [BEH-UDP]. 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The term "Realm" is adapted from [NAT-TERM] and is defined as 
   follows. "Realm" is often interchanged for "network domain" or simply
   "network" throughout the document.

   Address realm or Realm - An address realm is a network domain in
   which the network addresses are uniquely assigned to entities such
   that datagrams can be routed to them. Routing protocols used within
   the network domain are responsible for finding routes to entities
   given their network addresses. Note that this document is limited to
   describing NAT in IPv4 environment and does not address the use of
   NAT in other types of environments (e.g., IPV6 environment).

   The term "NAT Session" is adapted from [NAT-MIB] and is defined as
   follows.

   NAT Session - A NAT session is an association between a session as
   seen in the private realm and a session as seen in the public realm,
   by virtue of NAT translation. If a session in the private realm were
   to be represented as (PrivateSrcAddr, PrivateDstAddr,
   TransportProtocol, PrivateSrcPort, PrivateDstPort) and the same
   session in the public realm were to be represented as (PublicSrcAddr,
   PublicDstAddr, TransportProtocol, PublicSrcPort, PublicDstPort), the
   NAT session will provide the translation glue between the two session
   representations.  NAT sessions in the document are restricted to
   sessions based on TCP and UDP only. In the future, NAT sessions may
   be extended to be based on other transport protocols such as SCTP,
   UDP-lite and DCCP.

   ICMP Message Classification - Section 3.2.2 of [RFC1122] and Section
   4.3.1 of [RFC1812] broadly group ICMP messages into two main
   categories, namely "ICMP Query" messages and "ICMP Error" messages.
   All ICMP Error messages listed in RFC1122 and RFC1812 contain part
   of the internet datagram that elicited the ICMP error. All the ICMP
   Query messages listed in RFC1122 and RFC1812 contain an "Identifier"
   field, which is referred to in this document as "Query Identifier".
   There are however ICMP messages that do not fall into any of these
   two categories. We refer to them as "Non-QueryError ICMP Messages".

Internet-Draft    NAT Behavioral Requirements for ICMP     November 2008


   All three ICMP message classes are described as follows:

   o ICMP Query Messages - ICMP Query messages are characterized by an
     Identifier field in the ICMP header. The Identifier field used by
     the ICMP Query messages is also referred as "Query Identifier" or
     "Query Id", for short throughout the document. A Query Id is used
     by Query senders and responders as the equivalent of a TCP/UDP
     port to identify an ICMP Query session. ICMP Query Messages
     include ICMP Messages defined after RFC1122 or RFC1812, as for
     example Domain Name Request/Reply ICMP messages defined in 
     RFC1788, as they include request/response pairs and contain an
     "Identifier" field.
   
   o ICMP Error Messages - ICMP Error messages provide signaling for
     IP. All ICMP Error messages are characterized by the fact that
     they embed the original datagram that triggered the ICMP Error
     message. The original datagram embedded within the ICMP Error
     payload is also referred as "Embedded packet", throughout the
     document. Unlike ICMP Query messages, ICMP Error messages do not
     have a Query Id in the ICMP header.

   o Non-QueryError ICMP Messages - ICMP messages that do not fall
     under either of the above two classes are referred to as 
     "Non-QueryError ICMP Messages" throughout the document. For
     example, Router Discovery ICMP messages ([RFC1256]) are 
     "request/response" type ICMP messages. However, they are not
     characterized as ICMP Query messages in this document as they
     do not have an "Identifier" field within the messages. Likewise,
     there are other ICMP messages defined in [RFC4065] that do not
     fall in either of ICMP Query or ICMP Error message categories,
     but will be referred as Non-QueryError ICMP messages.

   The reason for categorizing ICMP messages for a NAT behavioral 
   properties is because each category has different characteristics 
   used for mapping (i.e., the Query Id and the Embedded datagram), 
   which leaves the Non-QueryError ICMP messages in a separate 
   distinctive group.

3. ICMP Query Handling

   This section lists the behavioral requirements for a NAT device
   when processing ICMP Query packets. The following sub sections
   discuss requirements specific to ICMP Query handling in detail.

3.1. ICMP Query Mapping

   Unless local policy explicitly overrides, a NAT device MUST permit
   ICMP Queries and their associated responses, when the Query is



Srisuresh, et. al.                                              [Page 5]

Internet-Draft    NAT Behavioral Requirements for ICMP     November 2008


   initiated from a private host to the external hosts. ICMP Query
   mapping by NAT devices is necessary for current ICMP Query based
   applications to work. This entails a NAT device to transparently
   forward ICMP Query packets initiated from the nodes behind NAT
   and the responses to these Query packets in the opposite
   direction. As specified in [NAT-TRAD], this requires translating
   the IP header. A NAPT device further translates the ICMP Query Id
   and the associated checksum in the ICMP header prior to forwarding.

   NAT mapping of ICMP Query Identifiers SHOULD be external host 
   independent. Say, an internal host A sent an ICMP Query out to an
   external host B using Query Id X. And, say, the NAT assigned this
   an external mapping of Query Id X' on the NAT's public address. If 
   host A reused the Query Id X to send ICMP Queries to the same or 
   different external host, the NAT device SHOULD reuse the same Query
   Id mapping (i.e.,  map private host's  Query Id X to Query Id X' on
   NAT's public IP address) instead of assigning a different mapping.
   This is similar to the "endpoint independent mapping" requirement
   specified in the TCP and UDP requirement documents ([BEH-UDP], 
   [BEH-TCP]). 

   Below is justification for making the endpoint independent mapping
   for ICMP Query Id a SHOULD [RFC2119] requirement. ICMP Ping 
   ([RFC1470]) and ICMP traceroute ([MS-TRCRT]) are two most commonly
   known legacy applications built on top of ICMP Query messages.
   Neither of these applications require the ICMP Query Id to be
   retained across different sessions with external hosts. But, that
   may not be case with future applications. In the future, when an
   end host application reuses the same Query Identifier in sessions
   with different target hosts, the end host application might require
   that the endpoint identity (i.e., the tuple of IP address and Query
   Identifier) appears the same across all its target hosts. Such a
   requirement will be valid to make in an IP network without NAT 
   devices. When NAT devices enforce endpoint mapping that is external
   host independent, the above assumption will be valid to make even
   in a world with NAT devices. Given the dichotomy between legacy
   applications not requiring endpoint independent mapping and future
   applications that might require it, the requirement level is kept
   at SHOULD [RFC2119].

   REQ-1: Unless local policy explicitly overrides, a NAT device MUST
   permit ICMP Queries and their associated responses, when the Query
   is initiated from a private host to the external hosts.
   a) NAT mapping of ICMP Query Identifiers SHOULD be external host 
   independent.

3.2. ICMP Query Session Timeouts

   NATs maintain a mapping timeout for the ICMP Queries that traverse
   them. The mapping timeout is the time a mapping will stay active
   without packets traversing the NAT. There is great variation in the
   values used by different NATs. The ICMP Query session timeout
   requirement is necessary for current ICMP Query applications to
   work. Query response times can vary. ICMP Query based applications
   are primarily request/response driven. 

   Ideally, the timeout should be set to Maximum Round Trip Time 
   (Maximum RTT). For the purposes of constraining the maximum RTT, the
   Maximum Segment Lifetime (MSL), defined in [RFC793] could be 
   considered a guideline to set packet lifetime. Per [RFC793], MSL is
   the maximum amount of time a TCP segment can exist in a network
   before being delivered to the intended recipient. This is the maximum
   duration an IP packet can be assumed to take to reach the intended
   destination node before declaring that the packet will no longer be
   delivered. For an application initiating ICMP Query message and
   waiting for a response for the Query, the Maximum RTT could in
   practice be constrained to be sum total of MSL for the Query message
   and MSL for the response message. In other words, Maximum RTT could
   be constrained to no more than 2x MSL. The recommended value for MSL
   in [RFC793] is 120 seconds, even though several implementations set
   this to 60 seconds or 30 seconds. When MSL is 120 seconds, the
   Maximum RTT (2x MSL) would be 240 seconds.

   In practice, ICMP Ping ([RFC1470]) and ICMP traceroute ([MS-TRCRT]),
   the two most commonly known legacy applications built on top of ICMP
   Query messages take less than 10 seconds to complete a round trip,
   when the target node is operational on the network.

   Setting the ICMP NAT session timeout to a very large duration (say, 
   240 seconds) could potentially tie up precious NAT resources such as
   Query mappings and NAT Sessions for the whole duration. On the other
   hand, setting the timeout very low can result in premature freeing
   of NAT resources and applications failing to complete gracefully.
   The ICMP Query session timeout needs to be a balance between the two
   extremes. 60 seconds timeout is a balance between the two extremes.
   An ICMP Query session timer MUST NOT expire in less than 60 seconds.
   It is RECOMMENDED that the ICMP Query session timer be made
   configurable. 

   REQ-2: An ICMP Query session timer MUST NOT expire in less than 60
   seconds.
   a) It is RECOMMENDED that the ICMP Query session timer be made
   configurable.

4. ICMP Error Forwarding
 
   Many applications make use of ICMP Error messages from end hosts and
   intermediate devices to shorten application timeouts. Some
   applications will not operate correctly without the receipt of ICMP
   Error messages. The following sub-sections discuss the requirements
   a NAT device must conform to in order to ensure reliable forwarding. 

4.1. ICMP Error Payload Validation
 
   ICMP Error message checksum covers the entire ICMP message, including
   the payload. When an ICMP Error packet is received, if the ICMP
   checksum fails to validate, the NAT SHOULD silently drop the ICMP
   Error packet. This is because NAT uses the embedded IP and transport
   headers for forwarding and translating the ICMP Error message
   (described in section 4.2). When the ICMP checksum is invalid, the
   embedded IP and transport headers, which are covered by the ICMP 
   checksum, are also suspect.   

   [RFC1812] and [RFC1122] require a router or an end host that receives
   an IP packet with invalid IP header checksum to silently drop the IP
   packet. As such, end hosts and routers do not generate an ICMP Error
   message in response to IP packets with invalid IP header checksum.
   For this reason, If the IP checksum of the embedded packet within an
   ICMP Error message fails to validate, the NAT SHOULD silently
   drop the Error packet.
   
   When the IP packet embedded within the ICMP Error message includes IP
   options, the NAT device must not assume that the transport header of
   the embedded packet is at a fixed offset (as would be the case when
   there are no IP options associated with the packet) from the start of
   the embedded packet. Specifically, if the embedded packet includes IP
   options, the NAT device MUST traverse past the IP options to locate
   the start of transport header for the embedded packet.

   It is possible to compute the transport checksum of the embedded
   packet within an ICMP Error message when the ICMP Error message
   contains the entire transport segment. However, ICMP Error messages
   do not contain the entire transport segment in many cases. This is
   because [ICMP] stipulates that an ICMP Error message should embed
   IP header and only a minimum of 64 bits of the IP payload. Even
   though, section 4.3.2.3 of [RFC1812] recommends an ICMP Error
   originator to include as much of the original packet as possible
   in the payload, the length of the resulting ICMP datagram cannot
   exceed 576 bytes. ICMP Error originators truncate IP packets that
   do not fit within the stipulations. 




Srisuresh, et. al.                                              [Page 8]

Internet-Draft    NAT Behavioral Requirements for ICMP     November 2008


   A NAT device SHOULD NOT validate the transport checksum of the
   embedded packet within an ICMP Error message, even when it is 
   possible to do so. This is because NAT dropping an ICMP Error
   message due to invalid transport checksum will make it harder for
   end hosts to receive error reporting for certain types of
   corruption. End-to-end validation of ICMP Error messages is best
   left to end hosts. Many newer revision end host TCP/IP stacks
   implement the improvements in [TCP-SOFT] and do not accept ICMP
   Error messages with a mismatched IP or TCP checksum in the
   embedded packet, if the embedded datagram contains full IP packet
   and the TCP checksum can be calculated. 

   In the case the ICMP Error payload includes ICMP extensions
   ([ICMP-EXT]), the NAT device MUST exclude the optional zero-padding
   and the ICMP extensions when evaluating transport checksum for the
   embedded packet. Readers are urged to refer [ICMP-EXT] for 
   identifying the presence of ICMP extensions in an ICMP message.
   
   REQ-3: When an ICMP Error packet is received, if the ICMP checksum
   fails to validate, the NAT SHOULD silently drop the ICMP Error
   packet. If the ICMP checksum is valid, do the following.
   a) If the IP checksum of the embedded packet fails to validate, the 
   NAT SHOULD silently drop the Error packet; and
   b) If the embedded packet includes IP options, the NAT device MUST
   traverse past the IP options to locate the start of transport 
   header for the embedded packet; and
   c) The NAT device SHOULD NOT validate the transport checksum of the
   embedded packet within an ICMP Error message, even when it is 
   possible to do so; and
   d) If the ICMP Error payload contains ICMP extensions([ICMP-EXT]), 
   the NAT device MUST exclude the optional zero-padding and the ICMP
   extensions when evaluating transport checksum for the embedded
   packet.
 

4.2. ICMP Error Packet Translation

   Section 4.3 of [NAT-TRAD] describes the fields of an ICMP Error
   message that a NAT device translates. In this section, we describe
   the requirements a NAT device must conform to while performing the
   translations. Requirements identified in this section are necessary
   for the current applications to work correctly.

   Consider the following scenario in figure 1. Say, NAT-xy is a NAT
   device connecting hosts in private and external networks.
   Router-x and Host-x are in the external network. Router-y and
   Host-y are in the private network. The subnets in the external
   network are routable from the private as well as the external



Srisuresh, et. al.                                              [Page 9]

   domains. By contrast, the subnets in the private network are only
   routable within the private domain. When Host-y initiated a session
   to Host-x, let us say that the NAT device mapped the endpoint on
   Host-y into Host-y' in the external network. The following
   subsections describe the processing of ICMP Error messages on the
   NAT device(NAT-xy), when the NAT device receives an ICMP Error
   message in response to a packet pertaining to this session.

   When the NAT device receives the ICMP Error packet, the NAT device
   uses the packet embedded within the ICMP Error message (i.e., 
   the IP packet from Host-y' to Host-x) to look up the NAT Session the
   embedded packet belongs to. If the NAT device does not have an
   active mapping for the embedded packet, the NAT SHOULD silently
   drop the ICMP Error packet. Otherwise, the NAT device MUST use
   the matching NAT Session to translate the embedded packet. That is,
   translate the source IP address of the embedded packet (e.g.,

   then the NAT MUST do the following prior to forwarding the packet,

   When the NAT device receives the ICMP Error packet, the NAT device
   MUST use the packet embedded within the ICMP Error message (i.e., 
   the IP packet from Host-x to Host-y) to look up the NAT Session the
   embedded packet belongs to. If the NAT device does not have an

   device must simply use the NAT Session to translate the source IP
   address Host-y to Host-y'. If the ICMP Error message is originated

Internet-Draft    NAT Behavioral Requirements for ICMP     November 2008


   by the intermediate node Router-y, translation of the source IP
   address varies depending on whether Basic NAT or NAPT function
   ([NAT-TRAD]) is enforced by the NAT device. A NAT device enforcing
   Basic NAT function has a pool of public IP addresses and enforces
   address mapping (which is different from the endpoint mapping
   enforced by NAPT) when a private node initiates an outgoing session
   via the NAT device. So, if the NAT device has active mapping for
   the IP address of the intermediate node Router-y, the NAT device
   MUST translate the source IP address of the ICMP Error packet with
   the public IP address in the mapping. In all other cases, the NAT
   device MUST simply use its own IP address in the external domain
   to translate the source IP address.

   REQ-5: If a NAT device receives an ICMP Error packet from private
   realm, and the NAT does not have an active mapping for the embedded
   payload, the NAT SHOULD silently drop the ICMP Error packet. If the
   NAT has active mapping for the embedded payload, then the NAT MUST
   do the following prior to forwarding the packet, Unless local
   policy explicitly overrides.
   a) Revert the IP and transport headers of the embedded
   IP packet to their original form, using the matching mapping; and
   b) Leave the ICMP Error type and code unchanged; and
   c) If the NAT enforces Basic NAT function ([NAT-TRAD]), and the NAT
   has active mapping for the IP address that sent the ICMP Error, 
   translate the source IP address of the ICMP Error packet with the
   public IP address in the mapping. In all other cases, translate the
   source IP address of the ICMP Error packet with its own public IP
   address.


4.3. NAT Sessions Pertaining to ICMP Error Payload

   While processing an ICMP Error packet pertaining to an ICMP Query
   or Query response message, a NAT device MUST NOT refresh or delete
   the NAT Session that pertains to the embedded payload within the 
   ICMP Error packet. This is in spite of the fact that the NAT device
   uses the NAT Session to translate the embedded payload. This ensures
   that the NAT Session will not be modified if someone is able to
   spoof ICMP Error messages for the session. [ICMP-ATK] lists a number
   of potential ICMP attacks that may be attempted by malicious users
   on the network. This requirement is necessary for current
   applications to work correctly.

   REQ-6: While processing an ICMP Error packet pertaining to an ICMP
   Query or Query response message, a NAT device MUST NOT refresh or
   delete the NAT Session that pertains to the embedded payload within
   the ICMP Error packet.

5. Hairpinning Support for ICMP packets

   [BEH-UDP] and [BEH-TCP] mandate support for hairpinning for UDP and
   TCP sessions respectively on NAT devices. A NAT device needs to 
   support hairpinning for ICMP Query sessions as well. Specifically,
   NAT devices enforcing Basic NAT ([NAT-TRAD]) MUST support the
   traversal of hairpinned ICMP Query sessions. Say, for example,
   individual private hosts register their NAT assigned external IP
   address with a rendezvous server. Other hosts that wish to initiate
   ICMP Query sessions to the registered hosts might do so using the
   public address registered with the Rendezvous server. For this
   reason, Basic NAT devices are required to support the traversal of 
   hairpinned ICMP Query sessions. This requirement is necessary for 
   current applications to work correctly.

   Packets belonging to any of the hairpinned sessions could in turn
   trigger ICMP Error messages directed to the source of hairpinned
   IP packets. Such hairpinned ICMP Error messages will traverse the
   NAT devices enroute. All NAT devices  (i.e., Basic NAT as well as
   NAPT devices) MUST support the traversal of hairpinned ICMP Error
   messages. Specifically, the NAT device must translate not only the
   embedded hairpinned packet, but also the outer IP header that is
   hairpinned. This requirement is necessary for current applications
   to work correctly.

   A hairpinned ICMP Error message is received from a node in private
   network. As such, the ICMP Error processing requirement specified
   in Req-5 is applicable in its entirety in processing the ICMP
   Error message. In addition, the NAT device MUST translate the
   destination IP address of the outer IP header to be same as the
   source IP address of the embedded IP packet after the translation.

   REQ-7: NAT devices enforcing Basic NAT ([NAT-TRAD]) MUST support the
   traversal of hairpinned ICMP Query sessions. All NAT devices (i.e., 
   Basic NAT as well as NAPT devices) MUST support the traversal of
   hairpinned ICMP Error messages. 
   a) When forwarding a hairpinned ICMP Error message, the NAT device
   MUST translate the destination IP address of the outer IP header to
   be same as the source IP address of the embedded IP packet after
   the translation.
 

6. Rejection of Outbound Flows Disallowed by NAT

   A NAT device typically permits all outbound sessions. However,
   a NAT device may disallow some outbound sessions due to resource
   constraints or administration considerations. For example, a NAT



Srisuresh, et. al.                                             [Page 15]

Internet-Draft    NAT Behavioral Requirements for ICMP     November 2008


   device may not permit the first packet of a new outbound session,
   if the NAT device is out of resources (out of addresses or TCP/UDP
   ports or NAT Session resources) to set up a state for the session,
   or, the specific session is administratively restricted by the NAT
   device.

   When a NAT device is unable to establish a NAT Session for a
   new transport-layer (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.) flow due to resource
   constraints or administrative restrictions, the NAT device SHOULD
   send an ICMP destination unreachable message, with a code of 13
   (Communication administratively prohibited) to the sender, and drop
   the original packet. This requirement is meant primarily for future
   use. Current applications do not require this for them to work
   correctly. The justification for using ICMP code 13 in the ICMP
   Error message is as follows. Section 5.2.7.1 of [RFC1812] recommends
   routers to use ICMP code 13 (Communication administratively
   prohibited) when they administratively filter packets. ICMP code 13
   is a soft error and is on par with other soft error codes generated
   in response to transient events such as 'network unreachable' (ICMP
   type=3, code=0).

   Some NAT designers opt to never reject an outbound flow. When a 
   NAT runs short of resources, they prefer to steal a resource 
   from an existing NAT Session rather than reject the outbound flow.
   Such a design choice may appear conformant to REQ-8 below. However,
   the design choice is in violation of the spirit of both REQ-8 and 
   REQ-2. Such a design choice is strongly discouraged. 
    
   REQ-8: When a NAT device is unable to establish a NAT Session for a
   new transport-layer (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.) flow due to resource
   constraints or administrative restrictions, the NAT device SHOULD
   send an ICMP destination unreachable message, with a code of 13
   (Communication administratively prohibited) to the sender, and drop
   the original packet.


7. Conformance to RFC 1812

   NAT devices should follow the best current practices of modern
   routers when handling ICMP messages, as specified in Section 4.3 of
   [RFC1812]. However, since the publication of [RFC1812] some of its
   requirements are no longer best current practices. Thus, the
   following requirements are derived from [RFC1812] and apply to NATs
   compliant with this specification:

   REQ-9: A NAT device MAY implement a policy control that prevents
   ICMP messages being generated toward certain interface(s).
   Implementation of such a policy control overrides the MUSTs and 



Srisuresh, et. al.                                             [Page 16]

Internet-Draft    NAT Behavioral Requirements for ICMP     November 2008


   SHOULDs in REQ-10.

   REQ-10: Unless overridden by REQ-9's policy, a NAT device needs to 
   support ICMP messages as below, some conforming to Section 4.3 of
   [RFC1812] and some superseding the requirements of Section 4.3 of
   [RFC1812].
       a. MUST support:
          1. Destination Unreachable Message, as described in 
             Section 7.1 of this document,
          2. Time Exceeded Message, as described in Section 7.2 of
             of this document,
          3. Echo Request/Reply Messages, as described in REQ-1.

       b. MAY support:
          1. Redirect Message, as described in Section 4.3.3.2 of
             [RFC1812],
          2. Timestamp and Timestamp Reply Messages, as described in 
             Section 4.3.3.8 of [RFC1812],
          3. Source Route Options, as described in Section 7.3 of
             this document,
          4. Address Mask Request/Reply Message, as described in 
             Section 7.4 of this document,
          5. Parameter Problem Message, as described in Section 7.5
             of this document,
          6. Router Advertisement and Solicitations, as described in
             Section 7.6 of this document.

       c. SHOULD NOT support:
          1. Source Quench Message, as described in Section 4.3.3.3
             of [RFC1812],
          2. Information Request/reply, as described in Section 4.3.3.7
             of [RFC1812].

   In addition, a NAT device is RECOMMENDED to conform to the following
   implementation considerations:
       d. DS Field Usage, as described in Section 7.7 of this document,
       e. When Not to Send ICMP Errors, as described in
          Section 4.3.2.7 of [RFC1812],
       f. Rate Limiting, as described in Section 4.3.2.8 of [RFC1812].


7.1. IP packet fragmentation

   Many networking applications (which include TCP as well as UDP based
   applications) depend on ICMP Error messages from the network to
   perform end-to-end path MTU discovery [PMTU]. Once path MTU is
   discovered, an application that chooses to avoid fragmentation may
   do so by originating IP packets that fit within the Path MTU enroute



Srisuresh, et. al.                                             [Page 17]

Internet-Draft    NAT Behavioral Requirements for ICMP     November 2008


   and setting the DF (Don't Fragment) bit in the IP header, so the
   intermediate nodes enroute do not fragment the IP packets. The
   following sub-sections discuss the need for NAT devices to honor the
   DF bit in the IP header and be able to generate "Packet Too Big" 
   ICMP Error message when they cannot forward the IP packet without
   fragmentation. Also discussed is the need to seamlessly forward
   ICMP Error messages generated by other intermediate devices.

7.1.1. Generating "Packet Too Big" ICMP Error Message

   When a router is unable to forward a datagram because it exceeds
   the MTU of the next-hop network and its Don't Fragment (DF) bit is
   set, the router is required by [RFC1812] to return an ICMP
   Destination Unreachable message to the source of the datagram, with
   the Code indicating "fragmentation needed and DF set". Further, 
   [PMTU] states that the router MUST include the MTU of that next-hop
   network in the low-order 16 bits of the ICMP header field that is
   labeled "unused" in the ICMP specification[ICMP].

   A NAT device MUST honor the DF bit in the IP header of the packets
   that transit the device. The NAT device may not be able to forward
   an IP packet without fragmentation if the MTU on the forwarding
   interface of the NAT device is not adequate for the IP packet. If
   the DF bit is set on a transit IP packet and the NAT device cannot
   forward the packet without fragmentation, the NAT device MUST send
   a "Packet Too Big" ICMP message (ICMP type 3, Code 4) with the 
   Next-Hop MTU back to the sender and drop the original IP packet.
   The sender will usually resend after taking the appropriate
   corrective action. 

   If the DF bit is not set and the MTU on the forwarding interface
   of the NAT device mandates fragmentation, the NAT device MUST
   fragment the packet and forward the fragments [RFC1812].

7.1.2. Forwarding "Packet Too Big" ICMP Error Message

   This is flip side of the argument for the above section. By virtue
   of the address translation NAT performs, NAT may end up being the
   recipient of "Packet Too Big" message. 
 
   When NAT device is the recipient of "Packet Too Big" ICMP message
   from the network, the NAT device MUST forward the ICMP message back
   to the intended recipient, pursuant to the previously stated
   requirements REQ-3, REQ-4 and REQ-5.

7.2. Time Exceeded Message

   Section 5.2.7.3 of [RFC1812] says that a router MUST generate



Srisuresh, et. al.                                             [Page 18]

Internet-Draft    NAT Behavioral Requirements for ICMP     November 2008


   "Time Exceeded" ICMP Error message when it discards a packet due
   to an expired TTL field. A router MAY have a per-interface option
   to disable origination of these messages on that interface, but that
   option MUST default to allowing the messages to be originated.

   NAT implementers are reminded that the requirements in Section
   5.2.7.3 of [RFC1812] apply to NATs, as well.

7.3. Source Route Options

   A NAT device MAY support modifying IP addresses in source route
   option so the IP addresses in the source route option are realm
   relevant. If a NAT device does not support forwarding packets with
   the source route option, the NAT device SHOULD NOT forward
   outbound ICMP messages that contain source route option in the
   outer or inner IP header. This is because such messages could
   reveal private IP addresses to the external realm.

7.4. Address Mask Request/Reply Messages

   Section 4.3.3.9 of [RFC1812] says an IP router MUST implement 
   support for receiving ICMP Address Mask Request messages and
   responding with ICMP Address Mask Reply messages. However, several
   years(more than 13 years at the time of this document) have elapsed
   since the text in rfc1812 was written. In the intervening time DHCP
   protocol [DHCP] has replaced the use of address mask request/reply.
   In the current time, there is rarely any host which does not meet
   host requirements [RFC1122] and needs a NAT device to support
   address mask request/reply. 

   For this reason, a NAT device is not required to support this ICMP
   message.

   A NAT device MAY support address mask request/reply message. 

7.5. Parameter Problem Message

   Section 4.3.3.5 of [RFC1812] says an IP router MUST generate a
   Parameter Problem message for any error not specifically covered
   by another ICMP message. However, this message is rarely used in
   practice in networks where IPv4 NATs are deployed. 

   For this reason, a NAT device is not required to support this ICMP
   message. 

   A NAT device MAY support parameter problem message.

Internet-Draft    NAT Behavioral Requirements for ICMP     November 2008


7.6. Router Advertisement and Solicitations

   Section 4.3.3.10 of [RFC1812] says an IP router MUST support the
   router part of the ICMP Router Discovery Protocol on all connected
   networks on which the router supports either IP multicast or IP
   broadcast addressing. However, this message is rarely used in
   practice in networks where IPv4 NATs are deployed. 

   For this reason, a NAT device is not required to support this ICMP
   message. 

   A NAT device MAY support Router Advertisement and Solicitations.


7.7. DS Field Usage

   [RFC1812] refers the TOS octet in the IP header, which contains the
   TOS and IP precedence fields. However, the TOS and IP precedence
   fields are no longer in use today. [RFC2474] renamed the TOS octet
   as the DS field and defined diffserv classes within the DS field.

   When generating an ICMP message, a NAT device SHOULD copy the
   diffserv class of the message that causes the sending of the ICMP
   error message. A NAT device MAY allow configuration of the
   diffserv class to use for the different types of ICMP messages.


8. Non-QueryError ICMP Messages

   In the preceding sections, ICMP requirements were identified for
   NAT devices, with a primary focus on ICMP Query and ICMP Error
   messages, as defined in the Terminology Section (see Section 2).
   This document provides no guidance on the handling of
   Non-QueryError ICMP messages by the NAT devices. A NAT MAY drop or
   appropriately handle Non-QueryError ICMP messages.

   REQ-11: A NAT MAY drop or appropriately handle Non-QueryError ICMP 
   messages. The semantics of Non-QueryError ICMP messages is defined
   in Section 2.


9. Summary of Requirements

   Below is a summary of all the requirements.

   REQ-1: Unless local policy explicitly overrides, a NAT device MUST
   permit ICMP Queries and their associated responses, when the Query
   is initiated from a private host to the external hosts.



Srisuresh, et. al.                                             [Page 20]

Internet-Draft    NAT Behavioral Requirements for ICMP     November 2008


   a) NAT mapping of ICMP Query Identifiers SHOULD be external host 
   independent.

   REQ-2: An ICMP Query session timer MUST NOT expire in less than 60
   seconds.
   a) It is RECOMMENDED that the ICMP Query session timer be made
   configurable.

   REQ-3: When an ICMP Error packet is received, if the ICMP checksum
   fails to validate, the NAT SHOULD silently drop the ICMP Error
   packet. If the ICMP checksum is valid, do the following.
   a) If the IP checksum of the embedded packet fails to validate, the 
   NAT SHOULD silently drop the Error packet; and
   b) If the embedded packet includes IP options, the NAT device MUST
   traverse past the IP options to locate the start of transport 
   header for the embedded packet; and
   c) The NAT device SHOULD NOT validate the transport checksum of the
   embedded packet within an ICMP Error message, even when it is 
   possible to do so; and
   d) If the ICMP Error payload contains ICMP extensions([ICMP-EXT]), 
   the NAT device MUST exclude the optional zero-padding and the ICMP
   extensions when evaluating transport checksum for the embedded
   packet.

   REQ-4: If a NAT device receives an ICMP Error packet from external
   realm, and the NAT device does not have an active mapping for the
   embedded payload, the NAT SHOULD silently drop the ICMP Error
   packet. If the NAT has active mapping for the embedded payload, 
   then the NAT MUST do the following prior to forwarding the packet,
   unless local policy explicitly overrides.
   a) Revert the IP and transport headers of the embedded IP packet to
   their original form, using the matching mapping; and
   b) Leave the ICMP Error type and code unchanged; and
   c) Modify the destination IP address of the outer IP header to be
   same as the source IP address of the embedded packet after
   translation.

   REQ-5: If a NAT device receives an ICMP Error packet from private
   realm, and the NAT does not have an active mapping for the embedded
   payload, the NAT SHOULD silently drop the ICMP Error packet. If the
   NAT has active mapping for the embedded payload, then the NAT MUST
   do the following prior to forwarding the packet, Unless local
   policy explicitly overrides.
   a) Revert the IP and transport headers of the embedded
   IP packet to their original form, using the matching mapping; and
   b) Leave the ICMP Error type and code unchanged; and
   c) If the NAT enforces Basic NAT function ([NAT-TRAD]), and the NAT
   has active mapping for the IP address that sent the ICMP Error,

Internet-Draft    NAT Behavioral Requirements for ICMP     November 2008


   translate the source IP address of the ICMP Error packet with the
   public IP address in the mapping. In all other cases, translate the
   source IP address of the ICMP Error packet with its own public IP
   address.

   REQ-6: While processing an ICMP Error packet pertaining to an ICMP
   Query or Query response message, a NAT device MUST NOT refresh or
   delete the NAT Session that pertains to the embedded payload within
   the ICMP Error packet.

   REQ-7: NAT devices enforcing Basic NAT ([NAT-TRAD]) MUST support the
   traversal of hairpinned ICMP Query sessions. All NAT devices (i.e., 
   Basic NAT as well as NAPT devices) MUST support the traversal of
   hairpinned ICMP Error messages. 
   a) When forwarding a hairpinned ICMP Error message, the NAT device
   MUST translate the destination IP address of the outer IP header to
   be same as the source IP address of the embedded IP packet after
   the translation.

   REQ-8: When a NAT device is unable to establish a NAT Session for a
   new transport-layer (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.) flow due to resource
   constraints or administrative restrictions, the NAT device SHOULD
   send an ICMP destination unreachable message, with a code of 13
   (Communication administratively prohibited) to the sender, and drop
   the original packet.

   REQ-9: A NAT device MAY implement a policy control that prevents
   ICMP messages being generated toward certain interface(s).
   Implementation of such a policy control overrides the MUSTs and 
   SHOULDs in REQ-10.

   REQ-10: Unless overridden by REQ-9's policy, a NAT device needs to 
   support ICMP messages as below, some conforming to Section 4.3 of
   [RFC1812] and some superseding the requirements of Section 4.3 of
   [RFC1812].
       a. MUST support:
          1. Destination Unreachable Message, as described in 
             Section 7.1 of this document,
          2. Time Exceeded Message, as described in Section 7.2 of
             of this document,
          3. Echo Request/Reply Messages, as described in REQ-1.

       b. MAY support:
          1. Redirect Message, as described in Section 4.3.3.2 of
             [RFC1812],
          2. Timestamp and Timestamp Reply Messages, as described in 
             Section 4.3.3.8 of [RFC1812],
          3. Source Route Options, as described in Section 7.3 of

             this document,
          4. Address Mask Request/Reply Message, as described in 
             Section 7.4 of this document,
          5. Parameter Problem Message, as described in Section 7.5
             of this document,
          6. Router Advertisement and Solicitations, as described in
             Section 7.6 of this document.

       c. SHOULD NOT support:
          1. Source Quench Message, as described in Section 4.3.3.3
             of [RFC1812],
          2. Information Request/reply, as described in Section 4.3.3.7
             of [RFC1812].

   In addition, a NAT device is RECOMMENDED to conform to the following
   implementation considerations:
       d. DS Field Usage, as described in Section 7.7 of this document,
       e. When Not to Send ICMP Errors, as described in
          Section 4.3.2.7 of [RFC1812],
       f. Rate Limiting, as described in Section 4.3.2.8 of [RFC1812].


   REQ-11: A NAT MAY drop or appropriately handle Non-QueryError ICMP 
   messages. The semantics of Non-QueryError ICMP messages is defined
   in Section 2.


10. Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security concerns related
   to ICMP message handling in the NAT devices. However, the
   requirements in the document do mitigate some security concerns
   known to exist with ICMP messages.

   [ICMP-ATK] lists a number of ICMP attacks that can be directed 
   against end host TCP stacks. For example, a rogue entity could 
   bombard the NAT device with a large number of ICMP Errors. If the
   NAT device did not validate the legitimacy of the ICMP Error 
   packets, the ICMP Errors would be forwarded directly to the end
   nodes. End hosts not capable of defending themselves against such
   bogus ICMP Error attacks could be adversely impacted by such 
   attacks. Req-3 recommends validating the ICMP checksum and the IP 
   checksum of the embedded payload prior to forwarding. These 
   checksum validations by themselves do not protect end hosts from
   attacks. However, checksum validation mitigates end hosts from
   malformed ICMP Error attacks. Req-4 and Req-5 further mandate that
   when a NAT device does not find a mapping selection for the embedded
   payload, the NAT should drop the ICMP Error packets, without



Srisuresh, et. al.                                             [Page 23]

Internet-Draft    NAT Behavioral Requirements for ICMP     November 2008


   forwarding.

   A rogue source could also try and send bogus ICMP Error messages for
   the active NAT sessions, with intent to destroy the sessions. Req-6
   averts such an attack by ensuring that an ICMP Error message does
   not effect the state of a session on the NAT device.

   Req-8 recommends a NAT device sending ICMP Error message when the
   NAT device is unable to create a NAT session due to lack of
   resources. Some administrators may choose not to have the NAT device
   send ICMP Error message, as doing so could confirm to a malicious
   attacker that the attack has succeeded. For this reason, sending 
   of the specific ICMP Error message stated in REQ-8 is left to the
   discretion of the NAT device administrator.

   Unfortunately, ICMP messages are sometimes blocked at network 
   boundaries due to local security policy. Thus, some of the
   requirements in this document allow local policy to override the
   recommendations of this document. Blocking such ICMP messages is
   known to break some protocol features (most notably Path MTU
   Discovery) and some applications (e.g., ping, traceroute), and
   such blocking is NOT RECOMMENDED.


11.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations.
