1.  Introduction

   In situations where packet loss is high, or perfect media quality is
   essential, Forward Error Correction (FEC) can be used to proactively
   recover from packet losses.  This specification provides guidance on
   which FEC mechanisms to use, and how to use them, for WebRTC
   implementations.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Types of FEC

   FEC describes the sending of redundant information in an outgoing
   packet stream so that information can still be recovered even in the
   face of packet loss.  There are multiple ways this can be

   accomplished for RTP media streams [RFC3550]; this section enumerates
   the various mechanisms available and describes their tradeoffs.

3.1.  Separate FEC Stream

   This approach, as described in [RFC5956], Section 4.3, sends FEC
   packets as an independent RTP stream with its own synchronization
   source (SSRC, [RFC3550]) and payload type, multiplexed with the
   primary encoding.  While this approach can protect multiple packets
   of the primary encoding with a single FEC packet, each FEC packet
   will have its own IP+UDP+RTP+FEC header, and this overhead can be
   excessive in some cases, e.g., when protecting each primary packet
   with a FEC packet.

   This approach allows for recovery of entire RTP packets, including
   the full RTP header.

3.2.  Redundant Encoding

   This approach, as described in [RFC2198], allows for redundant data
   to be piggybacked on an existing primary encoding, all in a single
   packet.  This redundant data may be an exact copy of a previous
   payload, or for codecs that support variable-bitrate encodings,
   possibly a smaller, lower-quality representation.  In certain cases,
   the redundant data could include encodings of multiple prior audio
   frames.

   Since there is only a single set of packet headers, this approach
   allows for a very efficient representation of primary + redundant
   data.  However, this savings is only realized when the data all fits
   into a single packet (i.e. the size is less than a MTU).  As a
   result, this approach is generally not useful for video content.

   As described in [RFC2198], Section 4, this approach cannot recover
   certain parts of the RTP header, including the marker bit, CSRC
   information, and header extensions.

3.3.  Codec-Specific In-band FEC

   Some audio codecs, notably Opus [RFC6716] and AMR [RFC4867], support
   their own in-band FEC mechanism, where redundant data is included in
   the codec payload.  This is similar to the redundant encoding
   mechanism described above, but as it adds no additional framing, it
   can be slightly more efficient.

   For Opus, audio frames deemed important are re-encoded at a lower
   bitrate and appended to the next payload, allowing partial recovery
   of a lost packet.  This scheme is fairly efficient; experiments

   performed indicate that when Opus FEC is used, the overhead imposed
   is only about 20-30%, depending on the amount of protection needed.
   Note that this mechanism can only carry redundancy information for
   the immediately preceding audio frame; as such the decoder cannot
   fully recover multiple consecutive lost packets, which can be a
   problem on wireless networks.  See [RFC6716], Section 2.1.7, and this
   Opus mailing list post [OpusFEC] for more details.

   For AMR/AMR-WB, packets can contain copies or lower-quality encodings
   of multiple prior audio frames.  See [RFC4867], Section 3.7.1 for
   details on this mechanism.

   In-band FEC mechanisms cannot recover any of the RTP header.

4.  FEC for Audio Content

   The following section provides guidance on how to best use FEC for
   transmitting audio data.  As indicated in Section 8 below, FEC should
   only be activated if network conditions warrant it, or upon explicit
   application request.

4.1.  Recommended Mechanism

   When using variable-bitrate codecs without an internal FEC, redundant
   encoding (as described in Section 3.2) with lower-fidelity version(s)
   of the previous packet(s) is RECOMMENDED.  This provides reasonable
   protection of the payload with only moderate bitrate increase, as the
   redundant encodings can be significantly smaller than the primary
   encoding.

   When using the Opus codec, use of the built-in Opus FEC mechanism is
   RECOMMENDED.  This provides reasonable protection of the audio stream
   against individual losses, with minimal overhead.  Note that, as
   indicated above, the built-in Opus FEC only provides single-frame
   redundancy; if multi-packet protection is needed, the aforementioned
   redundant encoding with reduced-bitrate Opus encodings SHOULD be used
   instead.

   When using the AMR/AMR-WB codecs, use of their built-in FEC mechanism
   is RECOMMENDED.  This provides slightly more efficient protection of
   the audio stream than redundant encoding.

   When using constant-bitrate codecs, e.g., PCMU [RFC5391], redundant
   encoding MAY be used, but this will result in a potentially
   significant bitrate increase, and suddenly increasing bitrate to deal
   with losses from congestion may actually make things worse.

Internet-Draft                 WebRTC FEC                       Jul 2019


   Because of the lower packet rate of audio encodings, usually a single
   packet per frame, use of a separate FEC stream comes with a higher
   overhead than other mechanisms, and therefore is NOT RECOMMENDED.

   As mentioned above, the recommended mechanisms do not allow recovery
   of parts of the RTP header that may be important in certain audio
   applications, e.g., CSRCs and RTP header extensions like those
   specified in [RFC6464] and [RFC6465].  Implementations SHOULD account
   for this and attempt to approximate this information, using an
   approach similar to those described in [RFC2198], Section 4, and
   [RFC6464], Section 5.

4.2.  Negotiating Support

   Support for redundant encoding of a given RTP stream SHOULD be
   indicated by including audio/red [RFC2198] as an additional supported
   media type for the associated m= section in the SDP offer [RFC3264].
   Answerers can reject the use of redundant encoding by not including
   the audio/red media type in the corresponding m= section in the SDP
   answer.

   Support for codec-specific FEC mechanisms are typically indicated via
   "a=fmtp" parameters.

   For Opus, a receiver MUST indicate that it is prepared to use
   incoming FEC data with the "useinbandfec=1" parameter, as specified
   in [RFC7587].  This parameter is declarative and can be negotiated
   separately for either media direction.

   For AMR/AMR-WB, support for redundant encoding, and the maximum
   supported depth, are controlled by the 'max-red' parameter, as
   specified in [RFC4867], Section 8.1.  Receivers MUST include this
   parameter, and set it to an appropriate value, as specified in
   [TS.26114], Table 6.3.

5.  FEC for Video Content

   The following section provides guidance on how to best use FEC for
   transmitting video data.  As indicated in Section 8 below, FEC should
   only be activated if network conditions warrant it, or upon explicit
   application request.

5.1.  Recommended Mechanism

   Video frames, due to their size, often require multiple RTP packets.
   As discussed above, a separate FEC stream can protect multiple
   packets with a single FEC packet.  In addition, the "flexfec" FEC
   mechanism described in [I-D.ietf-payload-flexible-fec-scheme] is also

Internet-Draft                 WebRTC FEC                       Jul 2019


   capable of protecting multiple RTP streams via a single FEC stream,
   including all the streams that are part of a BUNDLE
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation] group.  As a result, for
   video content, use of a separate FEC stream with the flexfec RTP
   payload format is RECOMMENDED.

   To process the incoming FEC stream, the receiver can demultiplex it
   by SSRC, and then correlate it with the appropriate primary stream(s)
   via the CSRC(s) present in the RTP header of flexfec repair packets,
   or the SSRC field present in the FEC header of flexfec retransmission
   packets.

5.2.  Negotiating Support

   Support for a SSRC-multiplexed flexfec stream to protect a given RTP
   stream SHOULD be indicated by including one of the formats described
   in [I-D.ietf-payload-flexible-fec-scheme], Section 5.1.2, as an
   additional supported media type for the associated m= section in the
   SDP offer [RFC3264].  As mentioned above, when BUNDLE is used, only a
   single flexfec repair stream will be created for each BUNDLE group,
   even if flexfec is negotiated for each primary stream.

   Answerers can reject the use of SSRC-multiplexed FEC, by not
   including the offered FEC formats in the corresponding m= section in
   the SDP answer.

   Use of FEC-only m-lines, and grouping using the SDP group mechanism
   as described in [RFC5956], Section 4.1 is not currently defined for
   WebRTC, and SHOULD NOT be offered.

   Answerers SHOULD reject any FEC-only m-lines, unless they
   specifically know how to handle such a thing in a WebRTC context
   (perhaps defined by a future version of the WebRTC specifications).

6.  FEC for Application Content

   WebRTC also supports the ability to send generic application data,
   and provides transport-level retransmission mechanisms to support
   full and partial (e.g. timed) reliability.  See
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel] for details.

   Because the application can control exactly what data to send, it has
   the ability to monitor packet statistics and perform its own
   application-level FEC, if necessary.

   As a result, this document makes no recommendations regarding FEC for
   the underlying data transport.

Internet-Draft                 WebRTC FEC                       Jul 2019


7.  Implementation Requirements

   To support the functionality recommended above, implementations MUST
   be able to receive and make use of the relevant FEC formats for their
   supported audio codecs, and MUST indicate this support, as described
   in Section 4.  Use of these formats when sending, as mentioned above,
   is RECOMMENDED.

   The general FEC mechanism described in
   [I-D.ietf-payload-flexible-fec-scheme] SHOULD also be supported, as
   mentioned in Section 5.

   Implementations MAY support additional FEC mechanisms if desired,
   e.g., [RFC5109].

8.  Adaptive Use of FEC

   Because use of FEC always causes redundant data to be transmitted,
   and the total amount of data must remain within any bandwidth limits
   indicated by congestion control and the receiver, this will lead to
   less bandwidth available for the primary encoding, even when the
   redundant data is not being used.  This is in contrast to methods
   like RTX [RFC4588] or flexfec's retransmission mode (
   [I-D.ietf-payload-flexible-fec-scheme], Section 1.1.7), which only
   transmit redundant data when necessary, at the cost of an extra
   roundtrip and thereby increased media latency.

   Given this, WebRTC implementations SHOULD prefer using RTX or flexfec
   retransmissions instead of FEC when the connection RTT is within the
   application's latency budget, and otherwise SHOULD only transmit the
   amount of FEC needed to protect against the observed packet loss
   (which can be determined, e.g., by monitoring transmit packet loss
   data from RTCP Receiver Reports [RFC3550]), unless the application
   indicates it is willing to pay a quality penalty to proactively avoid
   losses.

   Note that when probing bandwidth, i.e., speculatively sending extra
   data to determine if additional link capacity exists, FEC data SHOULD
   be used as the additional data.  Given that extra data is going to be
   sent regardless, it makes sense to have that data protect the primary
   payload; in addition, FEC can typically be applied in a way that
   increases bandwidth only modestly, which is necessary when probing.

   When using FEC with layered codecs, e.g., [RFC6386], where only base
   layer frames are critical to the decoding of future frames,
   implementations SHOULD only apply FEC to these base layer frames.

Internet-Draft                 WebRTC FEC                       Jul 2019


   Finally, it should be noted that although applying redundancy is
   often useful in protecting a stream against packet loss, if the loss
   is caused by network congestion, the additional bandwidth used by the
   redundant data may actually make the situation worse, and can lead to
   significant degradation of the network.

9.  Security Considerations

   In the WebRTC context, FEC is specifically concerned with recovering
   data from lost packets; any corrupted packets will be discarded by
   the SRTP [RFC3711] decryption process.  Therefore, as described in
   [RFC3711], Section 10, the default processing when using FEC with
   SRTP is to perform FEC followed by SRTP at the sender, and SRTP
   followed by FEC at the receiver.  This ordering is used for all the
   SRTP Protection Profiles used in DTLS-SRTP [RFC5763], which are
   enumerated in [RFC5764], Section 4.1.2.

   Additional security considerations for each individual FEC mechanism
   are enumerated in their respective documents.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no actions from IANA.
