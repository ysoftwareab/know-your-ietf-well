                    URN Namespace for MEF Documents
                        draft-mahesh-mef-urn-02

Abstract

   This document describes the Namespace Identifier (NID) 'mef' for
   Uniform Resource Names (URNs) used to identify resources published by
   MEF Forum (https://www.mef.net).  MEF specifies and manages resources
   that utilize this URN identification model.  Management activities
   for these and other resources types are handled by the manager of the
   MEF Assigned Names and Numbers (MANN) registry.

1.  Introduction

   The MEF Forum (MEF), is a nonprofit international industry standards
   organization, dedicated to the worldwide adoption of Carrier Ethernet
   (CE) networks and services.  The forum creates specifications in the
   area of Services, Architecture, Operations and Management.

   As part of these specifications efforts, there is a need to identify
   identifiers in a managed namespace that are unique and persistent.
   To ensure that this namespace's uniqueness is absolute, a
   registration of a specific Unified Resource Name (URN) URN Syntax
   [RFC2141] Namespace Identifier (NID) for use by MEF is being
   specified in this document.

2.  URN Specification for MEF

   Namespace ID:

   Registration information:

      registration version number: 1

Internet-Draft              Namespace for MEF              February 2016


      registration date: YYYY-MM-DD (Note to RFC Editor: Please add the
      registration date when this request gets accepted and remove this
      instruction)

   Declared registrant of the namespace:

      Registering organization



         Name: MEF Forum

         Address: 6033 W.  Century Boulevard, Suite 1107 Los Angeles CA
         90045 USA

      Designated contact:



         Role: Manager, MEF Namespace

         Email: namespace@mef.net

   Declaration of syntactic structure:

      The syntax of namespace specific strings for the 'mef' namespace
      is <NSS> in RFC 2141.

   Relevant ancillary documentation:

      MEF publishes information regarding the registered resources in
      the MEF Assigned Names and Numbers (MANN) registry
      (https://www.mef.net/MANN).

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

      MEF will manage resource classes using the "mef" NID and will be
      the authority for managing resources and associated subsequent
      strings.  MEF is expected to guarantee the uniqueness of the
      strings themselves, or it may permit secondary responsibility for
      certain defined resources.

      MEF could allow for use of experimental type values for testing
      purposes only.  Note that using experimental types may create
      collision as multiple users may use the same values for different
      resources and specific strings.

   Identifier persistence considerations:

Internet-Draft              Namespace for MEF              February 2016


      MEF will update the MEF Assigned Names and Numbers (MANN) registry
      to document the registered resources that will use the "mef" NID.

   Process of identifier assignment:

      Assignment of a URN from the MEF namespace will be documented as
      part of the MEF Assigned Names and Numbers (MANN) registry.

   Process of identifier resolution:

      The namespace is not listed with an Resolution Discovery System
      (RDS).  Therefore this process is not relevant.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

      The entire URN is case-insensitive.

   Conformance with URN Syntax:

      No special considerations

   Validation mechanism:

      None specified.  URN assignment will be handled by procedures
      implemented in support of MEF activities.

   Scope:

      Global

3.  Examples

   The following are examples of URNs that MEF is looking to assign:

      urn:mef:yang:mef-services

      urn:mef:yang:mef-interfaces

4.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations other than those
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general,
   which are described in Function Requirements for URN [RFC1737], URN
   Syntax [RFC2141].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document adds a new entry ("mef") in the urn-namespace registry.
   This is the defining document.  When published, the entry can be
   found in the "Uniform Resource Names (URN) Namespaces" registry
   available from the IANA site (https://www.iana.org) and any
   associated mirrors.
