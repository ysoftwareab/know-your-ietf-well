1.  Introduction

   This document proposes an extension to the Resource Reservation 
   Protocol (RSVP) [1] to allow an existing reservation to be reduced 
   in allocated bandwidth in lieu of tearing that reservation down when
   some of that reservation's bandwidth is needed for other purposes.  
   Several examples exist in which this mechanism may be utilized.  

   The bandwidth allotted to an individual reservation may be reduced 
   due to a variety of reasons such as preemption, etc. In such cases, 
   when the entire bandwidth allocated to a reservation is not 
   required, the reservation need not be torn down. The solution 
   described in this document allows endpoints to negotiate a new 
   (lower) bandwidth that falls at or below the specified new bandwidth 
   maximum allocated by the network.  Using a voice session as an 
   example, this indication in RSVP could lead endpoints, using another 
   protocol such as Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [9], to signal 
   for a lower bandwidth codec and retain the reservation. 

   With RSVP aggregation [2], two aggregate flows with differing 
   priority levels may traverse the same router interface. If that 
   router interface reaches bandwidth capacity and is then asked to 
   establish a new reservation or increase an existing reservation the
   router has to make a choice: deny the new request (because all 
   resources have been utilized) or preempt an existing lower priority 
   reservation to make room for the new or expanded reservation.

Internet Draft         RSVP Bandwidth Reduction          Sept 8th, 2005


   If the flow being preempted is an aggregate of many individual 
   flows, this has greater consequences.  While [2] clearly does not 
   terminate all the individual flows if an aggregate is torn down, 
   this event will cause packets to be discarded during aggregate 
   reservation reestablishment.  This document describes a method where 
   only the minimum required bandwidth is taken away from the lower-
   priority aggregated reservation and the entire reservation is not 
   preempted.  This has the advantage that only some of the microflows 
   making up the aggregate are affected.  Without this extension, all 
   individual flows are affected and the deaggregator will have to 
   attempt the reservation request with a reduced bandwidth.

   RSVP tunnels utilizing IPsec [8] also require an indication that 
   the reservation must be reduced to a certain amount (or less).  RSVP 
   aggregation with IPsec Tunnels is being defined in [11], which 
   should be able to take advantage of the mechanism created here in 
   this specification. 
  
   Note that when this document refers to a router interface being 
   "full" or "at capacity", this does not imply that all of the 
   bandwidth has been used, but rather that all of the bandwidth 
   available for reservation(s) via RSVP under the applicable policy 
   has been used.  Policies for real-time traffic routinely reserve 
   capacity for routing and inelastic applications, and may distinguish 
   between voice, video, and other real time applications.

   Explicit Congestion notification (ECN) [10] is an indication that 
   the transmitting endpoint must reduce its transmission.  It does not
   provide sufficient indication to tell the endpoint by how much the 
   reduction should be.  Hence the application may have to attempt 
   multiple times before it is able to drop its bandwidth utilization 
   below the available limit.  Therefore, while we consider ECN to be 
   very useful for elastic applications, it is not sufficient for the 
   purpose of inelastic application where an indication of bandwidth 
   availability is useful for codec selection.

   Section 2 will discuss the individual reservation flow problem 
   while Section 3 will discuss the aggregate reservation flow 
   problem space.  Section 4 lists the requirements for this extension.
   Section 5 details the protocol changes necessary in RSVP to create a
   reservation reduction indication.  And finally, there is an appendix
   with a walk-through example of how this extension modifies RSVP 
   functionality in an aggregate scenario.

   This document is intended to be classified as an 'update' to RFC 
   2205 [1], as this mechanism affects the behaviors of the ResvErr and 
   ResvTear indications defined in that document.

2.  Individual Reservation Reduction Scenario

   Figure 1 is a network topology that is used to describe the benefit
   of bandwidth reduction in an individual reservation.

             +--------------+            +--------------+ 

                 Figure 1. Simple Reservation Flows

        Figure 1. Legend/Rules:

      - Flow 1 priority = 300
      - Flow 2 priority = 100
      - Both flows are shown in the same direction (left to 
        right).  Corresponding flows in the reverse direction are
        not shown for diagram simplicity

   RSVP is a reservation establishment protocol in one direction only.
   This split path philosophy is because the routed path from one 
   device to the other in one direction might not be the routed path 
   for communicating between the same two endpoints in the reverse 
   direction.  End-systems must request 2 one-way reservations if that 
   is what is needed for a particular application (like voice calls).  
   Please refer to [1] for the details on how this functions.  This 
   example only describes the reservation scenario in one direction for
   simplicity sake.

   Figure 1. depicts 2 routers, (Rtr1 and Rtr2) initially with only one
   flow (Flow 1).  The flows are forwarded from Rtr1 to Rtr2 via 
   interface 2.  For this example, let us say that flow 1 and flow 2 
   each require 80 units of bandwidth (such as for the codec G.711 with
   no silence suppression).  Let us also say that the RSVP bandwidth 
   limit for interface 2 of Rtr1 is 100 units.

   As described in [3], a priority indication is established for each 
   flow. In fact, there are two priority indications: 

      1) one to establish the reservation, and 

      2) one to defend the reservation.

   In this example, flow 1 and flow 2 have an 'establishing' and a 
   'defending' priority of 300 and 100 respectively.  Flow 2 will have 
   a higher establishing priority than flow 1 has for its defending 
   priority.  This means that when flow 2 is signaled, and if no

Internet Draft         RSVP Bandwidth Reduction          Sept 8th, 2005

   bandwidth is available at the interface, flow 1 will have to 
   relinquish bandwidth in favor of the higher priority request of flow
   2.  The priorities assigned to a reservation are always end-to-end, 
   and not altered by any routers in transit.

   Without the benefit of this specification, flow 1 will be preempted.
   This specification makes it possible for the ResvErr message to 
   indicate that 20 units are still available for a reservation to 
   remain up (the interface's 100 units maximum minus flow 2's 80 
   units).  The  reservation initiating node (router or end-system) for
   Flow 1 has the opportunity to re-negotiate (via call signaling) for 
   acceptable parameters within the existing and available bandwidth 
   for the flow (for example, it may decide to change to using a codec 
   such as G.729)

   The problems avoided with the partial failure of the flow are:

   - Reduced packet loss which is resulted as flow 1 attempts to 
     re-establish the reservation for a lower bandwidth.

   - Inefficiency caused by multiple attempts until flow 1 is able to 
     request bandwidth equal to or lower than what is available. If 
     flow 1 is established with much less than what is available then 
     it leads to inefficient use of available bandwidth.

3.  RSVP Aggregation Overview

   The following network overview is to help visualize the concerns 
   that this specification addresses in RSVP Aggregates.  Figure 2 
   consists of 10 routers (the boxes) and 11 flows (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 
   A, B, C, D, and E).  Initially there will 5 flows per aggregate 
   (flow 9 will be introduced to cause the problem we are addressing in
   this document),with 2 aggregates (A & B); (1 through 5) in aggregate
   A and (A through E) in aggregate B.  These 2 aggregates will cross 
   one router interface utilizing all available capacity (in this 
   example).

   RSVP aggregation [per 2] is no different from an individual 
   reservation with respect to being unidirectional.

Internet Draft         RSVP Bandwidth Reduction          Sept 8th, 2005

      where aggregate A starts in Rtr1, and deaggregates in Rtr4.

      Flows 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 9 communicate through aggregate A

      The path for aggregate B is:
 
        Rtr5 ::> Rtr6 ::> Rtr10 ::> Rtr11 ::> Rtr7 ::> Rtr8 

      where aggregate B starts in Rtr5, and deaggregates in Rtr8.

      Flows A, B, C, D and E communicate through aggregate B

   Both aggregates share one leg or physical link: between Rtr10 and 
   Rtr11, thus they share one outbound interface: Int8 of Rtr10, where
   contention of resources may exist.  That link has an RSVP capacity 
   of 800kbps.  RSVP signaling (messages) is outside this 800kbps in 
   this example, as is any session signaling protocol like SIP.


3.1 RSVP Aggregation Reduction Scenario 

   Figure 2 shows an established aggregated reservation (aggregate A) 
   between the routers rtr1 and rtr4. This aggregated reservation 
   consists of 5 microflows (flow 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). For the sake of this 
   discussion, let us assume that each flow represents a voice call and
   requires 80kb (such as for the codec G.711 with no silence  
   suppression). Aggregate A request is for 400kbps (80kbps * 5 flows). 
   The priority of the aggregate is derived from the individual 
   microflows that it is made up of. In the simple case, all flows of a
   single priority are bundled as a single aggregate (another priority
   level would be in another aggregate, even if traversing the same 
   path through the network).  There may be other ways in which the 
   priority of the aggregate is derived, but for this discussion it
   is sufficient to note that each aggregate contains a priority (both
   hold and defending priority). The means of deriving the priority is 
   out of scope for this discussion.

   Aggregate B, in Figure 2, consists of flows A, B, C, D and E and 
   requires 400kbps (80kbps * 5 flows), and starts at rtr5 and ends 
   rtr8.  This means there are two aggregates occupying all 800kbps of 
   the RSVP capacity.

   When Flow 9 is added into aggregate A, this will occupy 80kbps more 
   than Int8 on rtr10 has available (880k offered vs. 800k capacity) 
   [1] and [2] create a behavior in RSVP to deny the entire aggregate B
   and all its individual flows because aggregate A has a higher 
   priority.  This situation is where this document focuses its 
   requirements and calls for a solution.  There should be some means 
   to signal to all affected routers of aggregate B that only 80kbps is
   needed to accommodate another (higher priority) aggregate.  A 
   solution that accomplishes this reduction instead of a failure 
   could:

Internet Draft         RSVP Bandwidth Reduction          Sept 8th, 2005


      - reduce significant packet loss of all flows within aggregate B

   During the re-reservation request period of time no packets will 
   traverse the aggregate until it is reestablished.

      - reduces the chances that the reestablishment of the aggregate 
        will reserve an inefficient amount of bandwidth, causing the 
        likely preemption of more individual flows at the aggregator 
        than would be necessary had the aggregator had more information
        (that RSVP does not provide at this time)

   During reestablishment of the aggregation in Figure 2. (without any 
   modification to RSVP), rtr8 would guess at how much bandwidth to ask
   for in the new RESV message.  It could request too much bandwidth, 
   and have to wait for the error that not that much bandwidth was 
   available; it could request too little bandwidth and have that 
   aggregation accepted, but this would meant that more individual 
   flows would need to be preempted outside the aggregate than were 
   necessary, leading to inefficiencies in the opposite direction.


4.  Requirements for Reservation Reduction

   The following are the requirements to reduce the bandwidth of a 
   reservation. This applies to both individual and aggregate 
   reservations:

   Req#1 - MUST have the ability to differentiate one reservation from
           another. In the case of aggregates, it MUST distinguish one
           aggregate from other flows.

   Req#2 - MUST have the ability to indicate within an RSVP error 
           message (generated at the router with the congested 
           interface) that a specific reservation (individual or 
           aggregate) is to be reduced in bandwidth.

   Req#3 - MUST have the ability to indicate within the same error 
           message the new maximum amount of bandwidth that is 
           available to be utilized within the existing reservation, 
           but no more.

   Req#4 - MUST NOT produce a case in which retransmitted reduction 
           indications further reduce the bandwidth of a reservation.
           Any additional reduction in bandwidth for a specified 
           reservation MUST be signaled in a new message.

   RSVP messages are unreliable and can get lost.  This specification 
   should not compound any error in the network.  If a reduction 
   message were lost, another one needs to be sent. If the receiver 
   ends up receiving two copies to reduce the bandwidth of a 
   reservation by some amount, it is likely the router will reduce the

Internet Draft         RSVP Bandwidth Reduction          Sept 8th, 2005

   bandwidth by twice the amount than was actually called for.  This 
   will be in error.  


5.  RSVP Bandwidth Reduction Solution

   When a reservation is partially failed, a ResvErr  (Reservation 
   Error) message is generated just as it is done currently with 
   preemptions.  The error spec object and the preemption_pri policy 
   object are included as well.  Very few additions/changes are needed 
   to the ResvErr message to support partial preemptions. A new error 
   sub code is required and is defined in section 5.1.  The error 
   flowspec contained in the ResvErr message indicates the flowspec 
   that is reserved and this flowspec may not match or be less than the
   original reservation request.  This is defined in section 5.2. 

   A comment about RESV message not using a reliable transport.  This 
   document recommends that ResvErr message be made reliable by 
   implementing mechanisms in [6].

   The current behavior in RSVP requires a ResvTear message to be 
   transmitted upstream when the ResvErr message is transmitted 
   downstream (per [1]).  This ResvTear message terminates the 
   reservation in all routers upstream of the router where the failure 
   occurred.  This document requires that the ResvTear is only 
   generated when the reservation is to be completely removed. In cases
   where the reservation is only to be reduced, routers compliant with 
   this specification requires that the ResvTear message MUST NOT be 
   sent.

   An appendix has been written to walk through the overall solution to
   the problems presented in sections 2 and 3.  There is mention of  
   this ResvTear transmission behavior within the appendix. 


5.1 Partial Preemption Error Code

   The ResvErr message generated due to preemption includes the Error 
   Spec object as well as the Preemption Priority Policy object.  The 
   format of Error-spec objects is defined in [1].  The error code 
   listed in the ERROR_SPEC object for preemption [5] currently is as 
   follows:

      Errcode = 2 (Policy Control Failure) and 
      ErrSubCode = 5 (ERR_PREEMPT)

   The following error code is suggested in the Error_spec object for 
   partial preemption:

      Errcode = 2 (Policy Control Failure) and 
      ErrSubCode = X (ERR_PARTIAL_PREEMPT)



Polk & Dhesikan         Expires March 8th, 2006               [Page 10]
Internet Draft         RSVP Bandwidth Reduction          Sept 8th, 2005

      Where 'X' is the number assigned by IANA for this error code

   There is also an error code in the preemption-pri policy object.  
   This error code takes a value of 1 to indicate that the admitted 
   flow was preempted [3].  The same error value of 1 may be used for 
   the partial preemption case as well. 


5.2 Error Flow Descriptor

   The error flow descriptor is defined in [1] & [7].  In the case of 
   partial failure, the flowspec contained in the error flow 
   descriptor indicates the highest average and peak rates that the 
   preempting system can accept in the next RESV message.  The 
   deaggregator must reduce its reservation to a number less than or 
   equal to that, whether by changing codecs, by dropping reservations,
   or some other mechanism.


5.3 Individual Reservation Flow Reduction

   When a router requires part of the bandwidth that has been allocated
   to a reservation be used for another flow, the router engages in the
   partial-reduction of bandwidth as described in this document. The 
   router sends a ResvErr downstream to indicate the partial error with
   the error code and sub code as described in section 5.1. The 
   flowspec contained in the ResvErr message will be used to indicate 
   the bandwidth that is currently allocated. 

   The requesting endpoint that receives the ResvErr can then negotiate
   with the transmitting endpoint to lower the bandwidth requirement 
   (by selecting another lower bandwidth codec, for example). After the
   negotiations, both endpoints will issue the RSVP PATH and RESV 
   message with the new, lowered bandwidth.


5.4 Aggregation Reduction of Individual Flows

   When a partial-failure occurs in a aggregation scenario, the 
   deaggregator receives the ResvErr message with the reduction 
   indication from a router in the path of the aggregate. It then 
   decides whether one or more individual flows from the aggregate are 
   to be affected by this ResvErr message.  The following choices are 
   possible:

   o If that (deaggregator) router determines one or more individual 
     flow(s) are to partially failed, then it sends a ResvErr message 
     with a reduced bandwidth indication to those individual flow(s). 
     This is as per the descriptions in the previous section (5.3).

   o If that (deaggregator) router determines one individual flow is to
     be preempted to satisfy the aggregate ResvErr, it determines which


Polk & Dhesikan         Expires March 8th, 2006               [Page 11]
Internet Draft         RSVP Bandwidth Reduction          Sept 8th, 2005

     flow is affected.  That router transmits a new ResvErr message 
     downstream per [3].  That same router transmits a ResvTear message
     upstream.  This ResvTear message of an individual flow does not 
     tear down the aggregate.  Only the individual flow is affected.  

   o If that (deaggregator) router determines multiple individual flows
     are to be preempted to satisfy the aggregate ResvErr, it chooses 
     which flows are affected.  That router transmits a new ResvErr 
     message downstream as per [3] to each individual flow.  The router
     also transmits ResvTear messages upstream for the same individual 
     flows.  These ResvTear messages of an individual flow do not tear 
     down the aggregate.  Only the individual flows are affected.

   In all cases, the Deaggregator lowers the bandwidth requested in the
   Aggregate Resv message to reflect the change. 

   Which particular flow or series of flows within an aggregate are 
   picked by the deaggregator for bandwidth reduction or preemption is 
   outside the scope of this document.


5.5 RSVP Flow Reduction involving IPsec Tunnels

   RFC 2207 (per [8]) specifies how RSVP reservations function in IPsec
   data flows.  The nodes initiating the IPsec flow can be an end-
   system like a computer, or it can router between two end-systems, or
   it can be an in-line bulk encryption device immediately adjacent to 
   a router interface, [11] directly addresses this later scenario.

   The methods of identification of an IPsec with reservation flow are 
   different than non-encrypted flows, but how the reduction mechanism 
   specified within this document functions is not.  

   An IPsec with reservation flow is, for all intents and purposes, 
   considered an individual flow with regard to how to reduce the 
   bandwidth of the flow.  Obviously an IPsec with reservation flow can
   be a series of individual flows or disjointed best effort packets 
   between two systems.  But to this specification, this tunnel is an 
   individual RSVP reservation.  

   Anywhere within this specification that mentions an individual 
   reservation flow, the same rules of bandwidth reduction and 
   preemption MUST apply.


6. Backwards Compatibility 

   Backwards compatibility with this extension will result in RSVP 
   operating as it does without this extension, and no worse.  The two 
   routers involved in this extension are the router that had the 
   congested interface and the furthest downstream router that 
   determines what to do with the reduction indication.


Polk & Dhesikan         Expires March 8th, 2006               [Page 12]
Internet Draft         RSVP Bandwidth Reduction          Sept 8th, 2005


   In the case of the router that experiences congestion or otherwise 
   needs to reduce the bandwidth of an existing reservation:

   - If that router supports this extension:

     #1 - it generates the ResvErr message with the error code 
          indicating the reduction in bandwidth

     #2 - it does not generate the ResvTear message

   - If that router does not support this extension, it generates both 
     ResvErr and ResvTear messages according to [1].

   In the case of the router at the extreme downstream of a reservation 
   that receives the ResvErr message with the reduction indication

   - If that router does support this extension:

     #1 - it processes this error message and applies whatever local 
          policy it is configured to do to determine how to reduce the 
          bandwidth of this designated flow

   - If the router does not support this extension:

     #1 - it processes the ResvErr message according to [1] and all 
          extensions it is able to understand, but not this extension 
          from this document.

   Thus, this extension does not cause ill effects within RSVP if one 
   or more routers support this extension, and one or more routers do 
   not support this extension.


7.  Security Considerations

   This document does not lessen the overall security of RSVP or of 
   reservation flows through an aggregate.

   If this specification is implemented poorly - which is never 
   intended, but is a consideration - the following issue may arise:

   1) If the ResvTear messages are transmitted initially (at the same 
      time as the ResvErr messages indicating a reduction in bandwidth 
      is necessary), all upstream routers will tear down the entire 
      reservation.  This will free up the total amount of bandwidth of 
      this reservation inadvertently.  This may cause the re-
      establishment of an otherwise good reservation to fail.  This has 
      the most severe affects on an aggregate that has many individual 
      flows that would have remained operational.

Internet Draft         RSVP Bandwidth Reduction          Sept 8th, 2005

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is to assign the following from RFC [XXXX] (this document):

   The following error code is to be defined in the Error_spec object 
   for partial reservation failure under "Errcode = 2 (Policy Control 
   Failure)":

      ErrSubCode = X (ERR_PARTIAL_PREEMPT)

      Where 'X' is assigned by IANA for this error code

   The behavior of this ErrSubCode is defined in this document.

         Duplicate of Figure 2. Generic RSVP Aggregate Topology        


   Looking at Figure 2., aggregate A (with five 80kbps flows) 
   traverses:

        Rtr1 ==> Rtr2 ==> Rtr10 ==> Rtr11 ==> Rtr3 ==> Rtr4 

   And aggregate B (with five 80kbps flows) traverses:

        Rtr5 ::> Rtr6 ::> Rtr10 ::> Rtr11 ::> Rtr7 ::> Rtr8 

   Both aggregates are 400kbps.  This totals 800kbps at Interface-7 in 
   Rtr10, which is the maximum bandwidth RSVP has access to at this 
   interface.  Signaling messages still traverse the interface without 
   problem.  Aggregate A is at a higher relative priority than 
   aggregate B.  Local policy in this example is for higher relative 
   priority flows to preempt lower priority flows during times of 
   congestion.  The following points describe the flow when aggregate A
   is increased to include flow 9.

   o   When flow 9 (at 80kbps) is added to aggregate A, Rtr1 will 
       initiate the PATH message towards the destination endpoint of 
       the flow. This hop-by-hop message will take it through Rtr2, 
       Rtr10, Rtr11, Rtr3 and Rtr4 which is the aggregate A path (that 
       was built per [2] from the aggregate's initial set up) to the 
       endpoint node.

   o   In response, Rtr4 will generate the RESV (reservation) message 
       [defined behavior per 1].  This RESV from the deaggregator 
       indicates an increase bandwidth sufficient to accommodate the 
       existing 5 flows (1,2,3,4,5) and the new flow (9) [as stated in 
       2].

   o   As mentioned before, in this example, Int8 in RTR 10 can only 
       accommodate 800kbps, and aggregates A and B have each already 
       established 400kbps flows comprised of five 80kbps individual 


Polk & Dhesikan         Expires March 8th, 2006               [Page 15]
Internet Draft         RSVP Bandwidth Reduction          Sept 8th, 2005

       flows. Therefore, Rtr10 (the interface that detects a congestion
       event in this example) must make a decision about this new 
       congestion generating condition in regard to the RESV message 
       received at Int8. 

   o   Local Policy in this scenario is to preempt lower priority 
       reservations to place higher priority reservations.  This would 
       normally cause all of aggregate B to be preempted just to 
       accommodate aggregate A's request for an additional 80kbps.  

   o   This document defines how aggregate B is not completely 
       preempted, but reduced in bandwidth by 80kbps.  This is 
       contained in the ResvErr message that Rtr10 generates 
       (downstream) towards Rtr11, Rtr7 and Rtr8.  See section 5 for 
       the details of the error message.

   o   Normal operation of RSVP is to have the router that generates a 
       ResvErr message downstream to also generate a ResvTear message 
       upstream (in the opposite direction towards Rtr5).  The ResvTear 
       message terminates an individual flow or aggregate flow.  This 
       document calls for that message to not be sent on any partial 
       failure of reservation. 

   o   Rtr8 is the deaggregator of aggregate B.  The deaggregator 
       controls all the parameters of an aggregate reservation.  This 
       will be the node that reduces the necessary bandwidth of the 
       aggregate as a response to the reception of an ResvErr message 
       (from Rtr10) indicating such an action is called for.  In this 
       example, bandwidth reduction is accomplished by preempting an 
       individual flow within the aggregate (perhaps picking on Flow D 
       for individual preemption by generating a ResvErr downstream on 
       that individual flow).  

   o   At the same time, a ResvTear message is transmitted upstream on 
       that individual flow (Flow D) by Rtr8.  This will not affect the 
       aggregate directly, but is an indication to the routers (and the
       source end-system) which individual flow is to be preempted.

   o   Once Rtr8 preempts whichever individual flow (or 'bandwidth' at 
       the aggregate ingress), it transmits a new RESV message for that
       aggregate (B), not for a new aggregate.  This RESV from the 
       deaggregator indicates an decrease in bandwidth sufficient to 
       accommodate the remaining 4 flows (A,B,C,E), which is now 
       320kbps (in this example).

   o   This RESV message travels the entire path of the reservation, 
       resetting all routers to this new aggregate bandwidth value.  
       This should be what is necessary to prevent a ResvTear message 
       from being generated by Rtr10 towards Rtr6 and Rtr5.

   Rtr5 will not know through this RESV message which individual flow 
   was preempted.  If in this example, Rtr8 was given more bandwidth to

   keep, it might have transmitted a bandwidth reduction ResvErr 
   indication towards the end-system of Flow D.  In that case, a voice 
   signaling protocol (such as SIP) could have attempted a 
   renegotiation of that individual flow to a reduced bandwidth (say, 
   but changing the voice codec from G.711 to G. 729).  This could have
   saved Flow D from preemption.
