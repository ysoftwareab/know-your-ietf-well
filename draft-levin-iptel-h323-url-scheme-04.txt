1. Abstract

H.323 Specification [3] and H.225.0 [4] together define a system and a
set of protocols for multimedia communications services over Packet
Based Networks (PBN).   H.225.0 [4] messages define means for carrying
any standard URL (Uniform Resource Locators) in order to specify source
and destination, involved in the call. Starting from H.323v.4 [3],
H.323 URL is defined and maintained as a part of this ITU-T
specification.
This IETF document reproduces the H323-URL definition of the ITU-T
Recommendation H.323v.4 [3] and is published as an RFC for ease of
access and IANA registration. If the H.323-URL scheme is updated by
the ITU-T in the future, the update will be published as an
informational RFC.  Thus this document contains a
limited right to produce derivative works.

2. IANA Considerations

The purpose of this document is to register the
specified and presented in the following chapter H.323-URL scheme name
within IANA. This will allow for improved resources use and integration
over the Internet. This document reproduces the exact H323-URL
definition of ITU-T Recommendation H.323v.4 [3].

The registration of H.323-URL scheme under the IETF tree has been
discussed within the iptel working group and approved by it because
H.323-URL is a general interest URL scheme to the Internet community.
It is agreed that if the H.323-URL scheme is updated by the ITU-T in
the future, the update will be published as an informational RFC.  


2. Conventions used in this document


The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1].


3. URL scheme name

Taking into consideration the guidelines of RFC-2717[12], 
the H.323 URL scheme, named "h323", is registered within the IETF
tree. It is despite the fact, that H.323 has been defined by ITU-T.
H.323 is deployed and used side-by-side with
other Internet protocols and technologies. This prevents
segmentation of the URL scheme definitions, belonging to the same
application group and being deployed in the same networks.


4. URL scheme formal syntax definition and character encoding

This document reproduces the exact H323-URL definition of the ITU-T 
Recommendation H.323v.4 [3].
The H323-URL definition has a form of user@host where user corresponds
to endpoint's alias and host corresponds to its domain/zone/gatekeeper
(in terms of H.323 [3]).  
The H.323 URL is defined in ABNF as shown below. Note that it utilizes 
the Core Rules specified in section 6.1 of [2].

H323-URL    =   "h323:" address [ url-parameters ]
address     =   user / "@" hostport / user "@" hostport
user        =   1*(%x21-24 / %x26-3F / %x41-7F / escaped)
            ; The symbols "%", "@", and symbols with
            ; a character value below 0x21 may be
            ; represented as escaped sequences.
hostport    =   host [ ":" port]
host        =   hostname / IPv4address / IPv6reference
hostname    =   *( domainlabel "." ) toplabel [ "." ]
domainlabel =   alphanum / alphanum *( alphanum / "-" ) 
            alphanum
toplabel    =   ALPHA / ALPHA *( alphanum / "-" ) alphanum
IPv4address =   1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT "." 
            1*3DIGIT
IPv6reference   =   "[" IPv6address "]"
IPV6address =   hexpart [ ":" IPv4address ]
hexpart     =   hexseq / hexseq "::" [ hexseq ] /
            "::" [ hexseq ]
hexseq      =   hex4 *( ":" hex4 )
hex4        =   1*4HEXDIG
port        =   1*DIGIT
url-parameters  =   *( ";" url-parameter )
url-parameter   =   1*(%x21-24 / %x26-3A / %x3C-7F / escaped)
            ; Specific parameter definitions are for
            ; further study.
            ; The symbols "%", ";", and symbols
            ; with a character value below 0x21 may be
            ; represented as escaped sequences.
alphanum    =   ALPHA / DIGIT
escaped     =   "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG

The host is case insensitive. 

The user is a Unicode [15] string that shall be UTF-8 [14] encoded 
and then escaped as necessary. Except for characters 
with a numeric value below 0x80, the user is case sensitive. The 
characters with a numeric value below 0x80 are case insensitive.
The character set and case sensitivity of the url-parameter is 
specified in each parameter definition.

5. Intended Usage

One of the alias types defined by H.323 [3] is the url-ID, which is 
intended to contain standard URL schemes that may be used to reach 
resources. In addition, URLs are referenced within Annex K/H.323 [13] 
and may be used in other services added to H.323 in the future. 
An H.323 entity may accept any valid URL that it understands, but 
should support the H.323 URL as defined in [3] and is reproduced in 
this document.
The H.323 URL is intended to help an entity resolve the address of 
another H.323 entity. It is composed of two parts: the user and the 
hostport. The user specifies an alias for the entity, such as a user 
or a service, without carrying any information about the location of 
the entity. The hostport, on the other hand, is the domain name of 
an Endpoint, Gatekeeper, or Border Element using terminology of [3].


6. Applications and/or protocols, which may use this URL scheme name

H.323 URL may be carried by another protocols, such as SIP [6]. It 
is practicable when the information about the destination (or the 
source) protocol is specified as a part of its URL. For example, that 
would facilitate SIP-H.323 interoperability (discussed in [7]) in 
more efficient manner.


7. Security Considerations

H.323 URL definition conceptually has the same approach as already 
defined and used URL schemes, such as [6].  When H.323 
URL is carried within H.225.0 [4] messages the security is addressed 
by H.235 security framework [5]. When H.323 URL is carried within 
other protocols (such as SIP [6]), the security is addressed within 
the corresponding protocol.
