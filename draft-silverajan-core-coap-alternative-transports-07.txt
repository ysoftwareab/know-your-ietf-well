             CoAP Communication with Alternative Transports
          draft-silverajan-core-coap-alternative-transports-07

Abstract

   CoAP has been standardised as an application level REST-based
   protocol.  A single CoAP message is typically encapsulated and
   transmitted using UDP or DTLS as transports.  These transports are
   optimal solutions for CoAP use in IP-based constrained environments
   and nodes.  However compelling motivation exists for understanding
   how CoAP can operate with other transports, such as the need for M2M
   communication using non-IP networks, improved transport level end-to-
   end reliability and security, NAT and firewall traversal issues, and
   mechanisms possibly incurring a lower overhead to CoAP/HTTP
   translation gateways.  This draft examines the requirements for
   conveying CoAP messages to end points over such alternative
   transports.  It also provides a new URI format for representing CoAP
   resources over alternative transports.

1.  Introduction

   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252] has been
   standardised by the CoRE WG as a lightweight, HTTP-like protocol
   providing a request/response model that constrained nodes can use to
   communicate with other nodes, be those servers, proxies, gateways,
   less constrained nodes, or other constrained nodes.

   As the Internet continues taking shape by integrating new kinds of
   networks, services and devices, the need for a consistent,
   lightweight method for resource representation, retrieval and

Internet-Draft         CoAP Alternative Transports         December 2014


   manipulation becomes evident.  Owing to its simplicity and low
   overhead, CoAP is a highly suitable protocol for this purpose.
   However, the CoAP endpoint can reside in a non-IP network, be
   separated from its peer by NATs and firewalls or simply has no
   possibility to communicate over UDP.  Consequently in addition to
   UDP, alternative transport channels for conveying CoAP messages could
   be considered.

   Extending CoAP over alternative transports allows implementations to
   have a significantly larger relevance in constrained as well as non-
   constrained networked environments.  It leads to better code
   optimisation in constrained nodes and broader implementation reuse
   across new transport channels.  As opposed to implementing new
   resource retrieval mechanisms, an application in an end-node can
   continue relying on using CoAP's REST-based resource retrieval and
   manipulation for this purpose, while changes in end point
   identification and the transport protocol can be addressed by a
   transport-specific messaging sublayer.  This simplifies development
   and memory requirements.  Resource representations are also visible
   in an end-to-end manner for any CoAP client.  The processing and
   computational overhead for conveying CoAP Requests and Responses from
   one underlying transport to another, would be less than that of an
   application-level gateway performing protocol translation of
   individual messages between CoAP and another resource retrieval
   protocol such as HTTP.

   This document first provides scenarios where usage of CoAP over
   alternative transports is either currently underway, or may prove
   advantageous in the future.  A simple transport type classification
   for CoAP-capable nodes is provided next.  Then a new URI format is
   described through which a CoAP resource representation can be
   formulated that expresses transport identification in addition to
   endpoint information and resource paths.  Following that, a
   discussion of the various transport properties which influence how
   CoAP Requests and Responses are mapped to transport level payloads,
   is presented.

   This document however, does not touch on application QoS
   requirements, user policies or network adaptation, nor does it
   advocate replacing the current practice of UDP-based CoAP
   communication.

2.  Usage Cases

   Apart from UDP and DTLS, CoAP usage is being specified for the
   following environments as of this writing:

Internet-Draft         CoAP Alternative Transports         December 2014


2.1.  Use of SMS

   CoAP Request and Response messages can be sent via SMS between CoAP
   end-points in a cellular network [I-D.becker-core-coap-sms-gprs].  A
   CoAP Request message can also be sent via SMS from a CoAP client to a
   sleeping CoAP Server as a wake-up mechanism and trigger communication
   via IP.  The Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) specifies both UDP and SMS as
   transports for M2M communication in cellular networks.  The OMA
   Lightweight M2M protocol being drafted uses CoAP, and as transports,
   specifies both UDP binding as well as Short Message Service (SMS)
   bindings [OMALWM2M] for the same reason.  For securing end-to-end
   communication between Mobile Stations, the use of DTLS-encoded CoAP
   messages over SMS is also being proposed
   [I-D.fossati-dtls-over-gsm-sms].

2.2.  Use of WebSockets

   The WebSocket protocol is being proposed as a transport channel
   between WebSocket enabled CoAP end-points on the Internet
   [I-D.savolainen-core-coap-websockets].  This is particularly useful
   as a means for web browsers, especially in smart devices, to allow
   embedded client side scripts to create new WebSocket connections to
   various WebSocket-enabled servers, through which CoAP Request and
   Response messages can be exchanged.  This also allows a browser
   containing an embedded CoAP server to behave as a WebSocket client by
   opening a connection to a WebSocket enabled CoAP Mirror Server
   [I-D.vial-core-mirror-server] to register and update its resources.

2.3.  Use of P2P Overlays

   [I-D.jimenez-p2psip-coap-reload] specifices how CoAP nodes can use a
   peer-to-peer overlay network called RELOAD, as a resource caching
   facility for storing wireless sensor data.  When a CoAP node
   registers its resources with a RELOAD Proxy Node (PN), the node
   computes a hash value from the CoAP URI and stores it as a structure
   together with the PN's Node ID as well as the resources.  Resource
   retrieval by CoAP nodes is accomplished by computing the hash key
   over the Request URI,opening a connection to the overlay and using
   its message routing system to contact the CoAP server via its PN.

2.4.  Use of TCP and TLS

   Using TCP to facilitate the traversal of CoAP Request and Response
   messages
   [I-D.bormann-core-coap-tcp][I-D.tschofenig-core-coap-tcp-tls], allows
   easier communication between CoAP clients and servers separated by
   firewalls and NATs.  This also allows CoAP messages to be transported
   over push notification services from a notification server to a

   client app on a smartphone, that may previously have subscribed to
   receive change notifications of CoAP resource representations,
   possibly by using CoAP Observe-functionality [I-D.ietf-core-observe].
   [I-D.tschofenig-core-coap-tcp-tls] also discusses using TLS as a
   transport to securely convey CoAP messages over TCP.

2.5.  Others

   CoAP could in addition be extended atop other transport channels,
   such as:

   1.  The transportation of CoAP messages in Delay-Tolerant Networks
       [RFC4838], using the Bundle Protocol [RFC5050] for reaching
       sensors in extremely challenging environments such as acoustic,
       underwater and deep space networks.

   2.  Any type of non-IP networks supporting constrained nodes and low-
       energy sensors, such as Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy
       (either through L2CAP or with GATT) [BTCorev4.1], ZigBee, Z-Wave,
       1-Wire, DASH7 and so on.

   3.  Instant Messaging and Social Networking channels, such as Jabber
       and Twitter.

3.  Node Types based on Transport Availability

   The term "alternative transport" in this document thus far has been
   used to refer to any non-UDP and non-DTLS transport that can convey
   CoAP messages in its payload.  A node however, may in fact possess
   the capability to utilise CoAP over multiple transport channels at
   its disposal, simultaneously or otherwise, at any point in time to
   communicate with a CoAP end-point.  Such communication can obviously
   take place over UDP and DTLS as well.  Inevitably, if two CoAP
   endpoints reside in distinctly separate networks with orthogonal
   transports, a CoAP proxy node is needed between the two networks so
   that CoAP Requests and Responses can be exchanged properly.

   In [RFC7228], Tables 1, 3 and 4 introduced classification schemes for
   devices, in terms of their resource constraints, energy limitations
   and communication power.  For this document, in addition to these
   capabilities, it seems useful to additionally identify devices based
   on their transport capabilities.

     | Name  |  Transport Availability    |

     |  T2   |  Multiple active transports|
     +-------+----------------------------+

    Table 1: Classes of Available Transports


   Nodes falling under Type T0 possess the capability of exactly 1 type
   of transport channel for CoAP, at all times.  These include both
   active and sleepy nodes, which may choose to perform duty cycling for
   power saving.

   Type T1 nodes possess multiple different transports, and can retrieve
   or expose CoAP resources over any or all of these transports.
   However, not all transports are constantly active and certain
   transport channels and interfaces could be kept in a mostly-off state
   for energy-efficiency, such as when using CoAP over SMS (refer to
   section 2.1)

   Type T2 nodes possess more than 1 transport, and multiple transports
   are simultaneously active at all times.  CoAP proxy nodes which allow
   CoAP endpoints from disparate transports to communicate with each
   other, are a good example of this.

4.  CoAP Alternative Transport URI

   Based on the usage scenarios as well as the transport classes
   presented in the preceding sections, this section discusses the
   formulation of a new URI for representing CoAP resources over
   alternative transports.

   CoAP is logically divided into 2 sublayers, whereby a request/
   response layer is responsible for the protocol functionality of
   exchanging request and response messages, while the messaging layer
   is bound to UDP.  These 2 sublayers are tightly coupled, both being
   responsible for properly encoding the header and body of the CoAP
   message.  The CoAP URI is used by both logical sublayers.  For a URI
   that is expressed generically as

   URI = scheme ":" "//" authority path-abempty ["?"query ]

Internet-Draft         CoAP Alternative Transports         December 2014


   a simple example CoAP URI, "coap://server.example.com/sensors/
   temperature" is interpreted as follows:



      coap :// server.example.com /sensors/temperature
      \___/    \______  ________/  \______  _________/
        |             \/                  \/
     protocol      endpoint          parameterised
    identifier    identifier           resource
                                      identifier


                       Figure 1: The CoAP URI format

   The resource path is explicitly expressed, and the endpoint
   identifier, which contains the host address at the network-level is
   also directly bound to the scheme name containing the application-
   level protocol identifier.  The choice of a specific transport for a
   scheme, however, cannot be embedded with a URI, but is defined by
   convention or standardisation of the protocol using the scheme.  As
   examples, [RFC5092] defines the 'imap' scheme for the IMAP protocol
   over TCP, while [RFC2818] requires that the 'https' protocol
   identifier be used to differentiate using HTTP over TLS instead of
   TCP.

4.1.  Design Considerations

   Several ways of formulating a URI which express an alternative
   transport binding to CoAP, can be envisioned.  When such a URI is
   provided from an end-application to its CoAP implementation, the URI
   component containing transport-specific information can be checked to
   allow CoAP to use the appropriate transport for a target endpoint
   identifier.

   The following design considerations influence the formulation of a
   new URI expressing CoAP resources over alternative transports:

   1.  A CoAP Transport URI can be supplied as a Proxy-Uri option by a
       CoAP end-point to a CoAP forward proxy.  This allows
       communication with a CoAP end-point residing in a network using a
       different transport.  Section 6.4 of [RFC7252] provides an
       algorithm for parsing a received URI to obtain the request's
       options.  Also, the generic syntax for a URI is described in
       [RFC3986].  By ensuring conformance to RFC3986, the need for
       custom URI parsers as well as resolution algorithms can be
       obviated.  In particular, a URI format needs to be described in




Silverajan & Savolainen   Expires June 20, 2015                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft         CoAP Alternative Transports         December 2014


       which each URI component clearly meets the syntax and percent-
       encoding rules described.

   2.  Request messages sent to a CoAP endpoint using a CoAP Transport
       URI may be responded to with a relative URI reference, for
       example, of the form "../../path/to/resource".  In such cases,
       the requesting endpoint needs to resolve the relative reference
       against the original CoAP Transport URI to then obtain a new
       target URI to which a request can be sent to, to obtain a
       resource representation.  [RFC3986] provides an algorithm to
       establish how relative references can be resolved against a base
       URI to obtain a target URI.  Given this algorithm, a URI format
       needs to be described in which relative reference resolution does
       not result in a target URI that loses its transport-specific
       information

   3.  The host component of current CoAP URIs can either be an IPv4
       address, an IPv6 address or a resolvable hostname.  While the
       usage of DNS can sometimes be useful for distinguishing transport
       information (see section 4.3.1), accessing DNS over some
       alternative transport environments may be challenging.
       Therefore, a URI format needs to be described which is able to
       represent a resource without heavy reliance on a naming
       infrastructure, such as DNS.

4.2.  URI format

   To meet the design considerations previously discussed, the transport
   information is expressed as part of the URI scheme component.  This
   is performed by minting new schemes for alternative transports using
   the form "coap+<transport-name>" and/or "coaps+<transport-name>",
   where the name of the transport is clearly and unambiguously
   described.  Each scheme name formed in this manner is used to
   differentiate the use of CoAP, or CoAP using DTLS, over an
   alternative transport respectively.  The endpoint identifier, path
   and query components together with each scheme name would be used to
   uniquely identify each resource.

   Examples of such URIs are:

   o  coap+tcp://[2001:db8::1]:5683/sensors/temperature for using CoAP
      over TCP

   o  coap+tls://[2001:db8::1]:5683/sensors/temperature for using CoAP
      over TLS

   o  coaps+sctp://[2001:db8::1]:5683/sensors/temperature for using CoAP
      over DTLS over SCTP

Internet-Draft         CoAP Alternative Transports         December 2014


   o  coap+sms://0015105550101/sensors/temperature for using CoAP over
      SMS with the endpoint identifier being a telephone subscriber
      number

   o  coaps+sms://0015105550101/sensors/temperature for using CoAP over
      DTLS over SMS with the endpoint identifier being a telephone
      subscriber number

   o  coap+ws://www.example.com/sensors/temperature for using CoAP over
      WebSockets

   o  coap+wss://www.example.com/sensors/temperature for using CoAP over
      secure WebSockets (WebSockets using TLS)

   A URI of this format to distinguish transport types is simple to
   understand and not dissimilar to the CoAP URI format.  As the usage
   of each alternative transport results in an entirely new scheme, IANA
   intervention is required for the registration of each scheme name.
   The registration process follows the guidelines stipulated in
   [I-D.ietf-appsawg-uri-scheme-reg], particularly where permanent URI
   scheme registration is concerned.

   It is also entirely possible for each new scheme to specify its own
   rules for how resource and transport endpoint information can be
   presented.  However, the URIs and resource representations arising
   from their usage should meet the URI design considerations and
   guidelines mentioned in this document.  In addition, each new
   transport being defined should take into consideration the various
   transport-level properties that can have an impact on how CoAP
   messages are conveyed as payload.  This is elaborated on in the next
   section.

5.  Alternative Transport Analysis and Properties

   In this section the various characteristics of alternative transports
   for successfully supporting various kinds of functionality for CoAP
   are considered.  CoAP factors lossiness, unreliability, small packet
   sizes and connection statelessness into its protocol logic.  General
   transport differences and their impact on carrying CoAP messages here
   are discussed.  Note that Properties 1, 2, and 3 are related.

   Property 1: Uniqueness of an end-point identifier.

   Transport protocols providing non-unique end-point IDs for nodes may
   only convey a subset of the CoAP functionality.  Such nodes may only
   serve as CoAP servers that announce data at specific intervals to a
   pre-specified end point, or to a shared medium.

Internet-Draft         CoAP Alternative Transports         December 2014


   Property 2: Unidirectional or bidirectional CoAP communication
   support.

   This refers to the ability of the CoAP end-point to use a single
   transport channel for both request and response messages.  Depending
   on the scenario, having a unidirectional transport layer would mean
   the CoAP end-point might utilise it only for outgoing data or
   incoming data.  Should both functionalities be needed, 2
   unidirectional transport channels would be necessary.

   Property 3: 1:N communication support.

   This refers to the ability of the transport protocol to support
   broadcast and multicast communication.  CoAP's request/response
   behaviour depends on unicast messaging.  Group communication in CoAP
   is bound to using multicasting.  Therefore a protocol such as TCP
   would be ill-suited for group communications using multicast.
   Anycast support, where a message is sent to a well defined
   destination address to which several nodes belong, on the other hand,
   is supported by TCP.

   Property 4: Transport-level reliability.

   This refers to the ability of the transport protocol to provide a
   guarantee of reliability against packet loss, ensuring ordered packet
   delivery and having error control.  When CoAP Request and Response
   messages are delivered over such transports, the CoAP implementations
   elide certain fields in the packet header.  As an example, if the
   usage of a connection-oriented transport renders it unnecessary to
   specify the various CoAP message types, the Type field can be elided.
   For some connection-oriented transports, such as WebSockets, the
   version of CoAP being used can be negotiated during the opening
   transfer.  Consequently, the Version field in CoAP packets can also
   be elided.

   Property 5: Message encoding.

   While parts of the CoAP payload are human readable or are transmitted
   in XML, JSON or SenML format, CoAP is essentially a low overhead
   binary protocol.  Efficient transmission of such packets would
   therefore be met with a transport offering binary encoding support,
   although techniques exist in allowing binary payloads to be
   transferred over text-based transport protocols such as base-64
   encoding.  A fuller discussion about performing CoAP message encoding
   for SMS can be found in Appendix A.5 of [I-D.bormann-coap-misc]

   Property 6: Network byte order.

Internet-Draft         CoAP Alternative Transports         December 2014


   CoAP, as well as transports based on the IP stack use a Big Endian
   byte order for transmitting packets over the air or wire, while
   transports based on Bluetooth and Zigbee prefer Little Endian byte
   ordering for packet fields and transmission.  Any CoAP implementation
   that potentially uses multiple transports has to ensure correct byte
   ordering for the transport used.

   Property 7: MTU correlation with CoAP PDU size.

   Section 4.6 of [RFC7252] discusses the avoidance of IP fragmentation
   by ensuring CoAP message fit into a single UDP datagram.  End-points
   on constrained networks using 6LoWPAN may use blockwise transfers to
   accommodate even smaller packet sizes to avoid fragmentation.  The
   MTU sizes for Bluetooth Low Energy as well as Classic Bluetooth are
   provided in Section 2.4 of [I-D.ietf-6lo-btle].  Transport MTU
   correlation with CoAP messages helps ensure minimal to no
   fragmentation at the transport layer.  On the other hand, allowing a
   CoAP message to be delivered using a delay-tolerant transport service
   such as the Bundle Protocol [RFC5050] would imply that the CoAP
   message may be fragmented (or reconstituted) along various nodes in
   the DTN as various sized bundles and bundle fragments.

   Property 8: Framing

   When using CoAP over a streaming transport protocol such as TCP, as
   opposed to datagram based protocols, care must be observed in
   preserving message boundaries.  Commonly applied techniques at the
   transport level include the use of delimiting characters for this
   purpose as well as message framing and length prefixing.

   Property 9: Transport latency.

   A confirmable CoAP request would be retransmitted by a CoAP end-point
   if a response is not obtained within a certain time.  A CoAP end-
   point registering to a Resource Directory uses a POST message that
   could include a lifetime value.  A sleepy end-point similarly uses a
   lifetime value to indicate the freshness of the data to a CoAP Mirror
   Server.  Care needs to be exercised to ensure the latency of the
   transport being used to carry CoAP messages is small enough not to
   interfere with these values for the proper operation of these
   functionalities.

   Property 10: Connection Management.

   A CoAP endpoint using a connection-oriented transport should be
   responsible for proper connection establishment prior to sending a
   CoAP Request message.  Both communicating endpoints may monitor the
   connection health during the Data Transfer phase.  Finally, once data

   transfer is complete, at least one end point should perform
   connection teardown gracefully.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

7.  Security Considerations

   While no new security risks are envisaged simply from the
   introduction of support for alternative transports, end-applications
   and CoAP implementations should take note if certain transports
   require privacy trade-offs that may arise if identifiers such as MAC
   addresses or phone numbers are made public in addition to FQDNs.

Internet-Draft         CoAP Alternative Transports         December 2014


Appendix A.  Expressing transport in the URI in other ways

   Other means of indicating the transport as a distinguishable
   component within the CoAP URI are possible, but have been deemed
   unsuitable by not meeting the design considerations listed, or are
   incompatible with existing practices outlined in [RFC7252].  They are
   however, retained in this section for historical documentation and
   completeness.

A.1.  Transport information as part of the URI authority

   A single URI scheme, "coap-at" can be introduced, as part of an
   absolute URI which expresses the transport information within the
   authority component.  One approach is to structure the component with
   a transport prefix to the endpoint identifier and a delimiter, such
   as "<transport-name>-endpoint_identifier".

   Examples of resulting URIs are:

   o  coap-at://tcp-server.example.com/sensors/temperature

   o  coap-at://sms-0015105550101/sensors/temperature

   An implementation note here is that some generic URI parsers will
   fail when encountering a URI such as "coap-at://tcp-
   [2001:db8::1]/sensors/temperature".  Consequently, an equivalent, but
   parseable URI from the ip6.arpa domain needs to be formulated
   instead.  For [2001:db8::1] using TCP, this would result in the
   following URL:

   coap-at://tcp-1.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.8.b.d.0
   .1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa:5683/sensors/temperature

   Usage of an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address such as [::ffff.192.100.0.1] can
   similarly be expressed with a URI from the ip6.arpa domain.

   This URI format allows the usage of a single scheme to represent
   multiple types of transport end-points.  Consequently, it requires
   consistency in ensuring how various transport-specific endpoints are
   identified, as a single URI format is used.  Attention must be paid
   towards the syntax rules and encoding for the URI host component.
   Additionally, against a base URI of the form "coap-at://tcp-
   server.example.com/sensors/temperature", resolving a relative
   reference, such as "//example.net/sensors/temperature" would result
   in the target URI "coap-at://example.net/sensors/temperature", in
   which transport information is lost.

Internet-Draft         CoAP Alternative Transports         December 2014


A.1.1.  Usage of DNS records

   DNS names can be used instead of IPv6 address literals to mitigate
   lengthy URLs referring to the ip6.arpa domain, if usage of DNS is
   possible.

   DNS SRV records can also be employed to formulate a URL such as:

   coap-at://srv-_coap._tcp.example.com/sensors/temperature

   in which the "srv" prefix is used to indicate that a DNS SRV lookup
   should be used for _coap._tcp.example.com, where usage of CoAP over
   TCP is specified for example.com, and is eventually resolved to a
   numerical IPv4 or IPv6 address.

A.2.  Making CoAP Resources Available over Multiple Transports

   The CoAP URI used thus far is as follows:


        URI         = scheme ":" hier-part [ "?" query ]
        hier-part   = "//" authority path-abempty


   A new URI format could be introduced, that does not possess an
   "authority" component, and instead defining "hier-part" to instead
   use another component, "path-rootless", as specified by RFC3986
   [RFC3986].  The partial ABNF format of this URI would then be:


         URI         = scheme ":" hier-part [ "?" query ]
         hier-part   = path-rootless
         path-rootless = segment-nz *( "/" segment )


   The full syntax of "path-rootless" is described in [RFC3986].  A
   generic URI defined this way would conform to the syntax of
   [RFC3986], while the path component can be treated as an opaque
   string to indicate transport types, endpoints as well as paths to
   CoAP resources.  A single scheme can similarly be used.

   A constrained node that is capable of communicating over several
   types of transports (such as UDP, TCP and SMS) would be able to
   convey a single CoAP resource over multiple transports.  This is also
   beneficial for nodes performing caching and proxying from one type of
   transport to another.

Internet-Draft         CoAP Alternative Transports         December 2014


   Requesting and retrieving the same CoAP resource representation over
   multiple transports could be rendered possible by prefixing the
   transport type and endpoint identifier information to the CoAP URI.
   This would result in the following example representation:



   coap-at:tcp://example.com?coap://example.com/sensors/temperature
           \_______  ______/ \________________  __________________/
                   \/                         \/
            Transport-specific            CoAP Resource
                Prefix



             Figure 2: Prefixing a CoAP URI with TCP transport

   Such a representation would result in the URI being decomposed into
   its constituent components, with the CoAP resource residing within
   the query component as follows:

   Scheme: coap-at

   Path: tcp://example.com

   Query: coap://example.com/sensors/temperature

   The same CoAP resource, if requested over a WebSocket transport,
   would result the following URI:



   coap-at:ws://example.com/endpoint?coap://example.com/sensors/temperature
           \___________  __________/ \_______________  ___________________/
                       \/                            \/
               Transport-specific             CoAP Resource
                     Prefix



          Figure 3: Prefixing a CoAP URI with WebSocket transport

   While the transport prefix changes, the CoAP resource representation
   remains the same in the query component:

   Scheme: coap-at

   Path: ws://example.com/endpoint

Internet-Draft         CoAP Alternative Transports         December 2014


   Query: coap://example.com/sensors/temperature

   The URI format described here overcomes URI aliasing [WWWArchv1] when
   multiple transports are used, by ensuring each CoAP resource
   representation remains the same, but is prefixed with different
   transports.  However, against a base URI of this format, resolving
   relative references of the form "//example.net/sensors/temperature"
   and "/sensor2/temperature" would again result in target URIs which
   lose transport-specific information.

   Implementation note: While square brackets are disallowed within the
   path component, the '[' and ']' characters needed to enclose a
   literal IPv6 address can be percent-encoded into their respective
   equivalents.  The ':' character does not need to be percent-encoded.
   This results in a significantly simpler URI string compared to
   section 2.2, particularly for compressed IPv6 addresses.
   Additionally, the URI format can be used to specify other similar
   address families and formats, such as Bluetooth addresses
   [BTCorev4.1].

A.3.  Transport as part of a 'service:' URL scheme

   The "service:" URL scheme name was introduced in [RFC2609] and forms
   the basis of service description used primarily by the Service
   Location Protocol.  An abstract service type URI would have the form

   "service:<abstract-type>:<concrete-type>"

   where <abstract-type> refers to a service type name that can be
   associated with a variety of protocols, while the <concrete-type>
   then providing the specific details of the protocol used, authority
   and other URI components.

   Adopting the "service:" URL scheme to describe CoAP usage over
   alternative transports would be rather trivial.  To use a previous
   example, a CoAP service to discover a Resource Directory and its base
   RD resource using TCP would take the form

   service:coap:tcp://host.example.com/.well-known/core?rt=core-rd

   The syntax of the "service:" URL scheme differs from the generic URI
   syntax and therefore such a representation should be treated as an
   opaque URI as Section 2.1 of [RFC2609] recommends.
