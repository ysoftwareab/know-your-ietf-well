1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-cdni-uri-signing] describes the concept of URI Signing and
   how it can be used to provide access authorization in the case of
   interconnected CDNs (CDNI).  The primary goal of URI Signing is to
   make sure that only authorized User Agents (UAs) are able to access
   specific content, with a Content Service Provider (CSP) being able to
   authorize every individual request.  As noted in
   [I-D.ietf-cdni-uri-signing], URI Signing is not a content protection



van Brandenburg         Expires February 13, 2016               [Page 2]

   scheme; if a CSP wants to protect the content itself, other
   mechanisms, such as DRM, are more appropriate.

   For content that is delivered via an HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS)
   protocol, such as MPEG DASH or HLS [Editor's Note: Include
   reference], special provisions need to be made in order to ensure URI
   Signing can be applied.  In general, HAS protocols work by breaking
   large objects (e.g. videos), into a sequence of small, independent
   chunks.  Such chunks are then referenced by a separate manifest file,
   which either includes a list of URLs to the chunks or specifies an
   algorithm through which a User Agent can construct the URLs to the
   chunks.  Requests for chunks therefore originate from the manifest
   file and, unless the URLs in the manifest file point to the CSP, are
   not subjected to redirection and URI Signing.  This opens up the
   vulnerability of malicious User Agents sharing the manifest file and
   deep-linking to the chunks.

   One method for dealing with this vulnerability would be to include in
   the manifest itself Signed URIs that point to the individual chunks.
   There exist a number of issues with that approach.  First, it
   requires the CDN delivering the manifest to rewrite the manifest file
   for each User Agent, which would require the CDN to be aware of the
   exact HAS protocol and version used.  Secondly, it would require the
   expiration time of the Signed URIs to be valid for at least the full
   duration of the content described by the manifest.  Since it is not
   uncommon for a manifest file to contain a video item of more than 30
   minutes in length, this would require the Signed URIs to be valid for
   a long time, thereby reducing their effectiveness and that of the URI
   Signing mechanism in general.  For a more detailed analysis of how
   HAS protocols affect CDNI, see Models for HTTP-Adaptive-Streaming-
   Aware CDNI [RFC6983].

   The method defined in this document allows CDNs to use URI Signing
   for HTTP Adaptive Streaming content without having to include the
   Signed URIs in the manifest files themselves.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in CDNI Problem Statement
   [RFC6707] and [I-D.ietf-cdni-uri-signing].

   In addition, the following term is used throughout this document:

   o  Signed Token: A set of URI Signing Information Elements protected
      by a URI Signature that can be used to retrieve a pre-determined
      set of resources.  It can be communicated via a URL, an HTTP
      Header or a Cookie.  A Signed Token differs from a Signed URI as
      defined in [I-D.ietf-cdni-uri-signing] in the sense that the token



van Brandenburg         Expires February 13, 2016               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft          CDNI URI Signing for HAS             August 2015


      is valid for multiple resources and it's embedded URI Signature
      thus does not protect a particular URI.  It can be used to form a
      Signed Token Chain in the case of HTTP Adaptive Streaming content.

1.2.  URI Signing in a non-CDNI context

   While the URI Signing for HTTP Adaptive Streaming scheme defined in
   this document was primarily created for the purpose of allowing URI
   Signing in CDNI scenarios, e.g. between a uCDN and a dCDN or between
   a CSP and a dCDN, there is nothing in the defined URI Signing scheme
   that precludes it from being used in a non-CDNI context.  As such,
   the described mechanism could be used in a single-CDN scenario such
   as shown in section 1.2 of [I-D.ietf-cdni-uri-signing] , for example
   to allow a CSP that uses different CDNs to only have to implement a
   single URI Signing mechanism.

2.  URI Signing for HAS overview

   In order to allow for effective access control of HAS content, the
   URI signing scheme defined in this document is based on a mechanism
   through which subsequent chunk requests can be chained together.  As
   part of the URI validation procedure, the CDN can generate a Signed
   Token that the UA can use to do a subsequent request.  More
   specifically, whenever a UA successfully retrieves a chunk, it
   receives, in the HTTP 2xx Successful message, a Signed Token that it
   can use whenever it requests the next chunk.  As long as each Signed
   Token in the chain is correctly validated before a new one is
   generated, the chain is not broken and the User Agent can
   successfully retrieve additional chunks.  Given the fact that with
   HAS protocols, it is usually not possible to determine a priori which
   chunk will be requested next (i.e. to allow for seeking within the
   content and for switching to a different quality level), the Signed
   Token includes a scoping mechanism that allows it to be valid for
   more than one URL.

   In order for this chaining of Signed Tokens to work, it is necessary
   for a UA to extract the Signed Token from the HTTP 2xx Successful
   message of an earlier request and use it to retrieve the next chunk.
   The exact mechanism by which the client does this depends on the
   exact HAS protocol and since this document is only concerned with the
   generation and validation of incoming request, this process is
   outside the scope of this document.  However, in order to also
   support legacy UAs that do not include any specific provisions for
   the handling of Signed Tokens, this document does define a legacy
   mechanism using HTTP Cookies that allows such UAs to support the
   concept of chained Signed Tokens without requiring any support on the
   UA side.

3.  Signed URI Information Elements

   This document defines a few additional Information Elements beyond
   those defined in [I-D.ietf-cdni-uri-signing].

3.1.  Enforcement Information Elements

   This section specifies an additional information element that is
   needed to enforce the CSP distribution policy, beyond those specified
   in [I-D.ietf-cdni-uri-signing]:

   o  Path Pattern (PP) [mandatory for Signed Token] - Path Pattern that
      describes for which content the Signed Token is valid.  The Path
      Pattern contains an expression to match against the requested URI
      path to check whether the requested content is allowed to be
      requested with the Signed Token.  A Path Pattern contains a
      sequence of one or more path segments seperated by a slash ('/')
      character.  The pattern may include the wildcards '*' and '?',
      where '*' matches any sequence of characters (including the empty
      string) and '?' matches exactly one character.  The three literals
      '\', '*' and '?' should be escaped as '\\', '\*' and '\?'.  All
      other characters are treated as literals.  The following is an
      example of a valid Path Pattern: '*/folder/content-83112371/
      quality_*/segment????.mp4'.  The Path Pattern Information Element
      MUST NOT be used in a Signed URI as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-cdni-uri-signing].

   The Path Pattern Information Element is used to restrict content
   access to a particular set of URLs, based on the path component of
   the URI on which it is available.  This is primarily useful for
   content delivered via an HTTP Adaptive Streaming protocol using a
   manifest file, where it is often not known a priori which segment
   will be requested next.

3.2.  Signature Computation Information Elements

   This section specifies two additional information elements that may
   be needed to verify and calculate a new Signed Token, in addition to
   the Signature Computation Information Elements specified in
   [I-D.ietf-cdni-uri-signing]:

   o  URI Signing Cookie Flag (USCF) [optional for Signed Token] - The
      presence of this flag indicates the URI Signing Information
      Elements contents of the URI Signing Package Attribute are
      communicated via the Cookie header of the HTTP request instead of
      via the query string component of the URI.  The URI Signing Cookie
      Flag MUST NOT be used in a Signed URI as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-cdni-uri-signing].

Internet-Draft          CDNI URI Signing for HAS             August 2015


   o  Expiration Time Setting (ETS) [optional for Signed Token] - An
      16-bit unsigned integer (in seconds) used for setting the value of
      the Expiry Time information element in newly generated Signed
      Tokens.  The Expiration Time Setting Information Element MUST NOT
      be used in a Signed URI as defined in [I-D.ietf-cdni-uri-signing].

   The URI Signing Cookie Flag Information Element is used to indicate
   the contents of the URI Signing Package attribute is communicated via
   the Cookie header of the HTTP request instead of via the query string
   component of the URI.  The primary use case for this is the case
   where the chained Signed Token mechanism is used in combination with
   legacy UAs.

   The Expiration Time Setting Information Element is used to
   communicate to the CDN to which duration the Expiry Time information
   element should be set whenever a new Signed Token is generated.

4.  Creating an initial Signed Token

   The following procedure defines the algorithm for creating the
   initial Signed Token of a Signed Token chain.  Note that the process
   described in this section is only performed for creating the initial
   Signed Token of a particular chain.  Subsequent Signed Tokens forming
   the same chain are generated as part of the URI Signature Validation
   process described in Section 5.  The creation of the initial Signed
   Token will typically be done by the CSP the first time a particular
   UA requests the manifest file.  Choosing appropriate values of the
   Enforcement Information Elements in the initial Signed Token requires
   some knowledge of the structure of the HTTP Adapative Streaming
   content that is being requested.

   In contrast with a Signed URI defined in [I-D.ietf-cdni-uri-signing],
   where the URI Signature is calculated over the Original URI, a Signed
   Token does not protect the Original URI.  Instead, the Path Pattern
   Information Element is used to convey the set of resources for which
   the particular Signed Token is valid.

   The process of generating a initial Signed Token can be divided into
   two sets of steps: first, calculating the URI Signature and then,
   packaging the URI Signature along with the URI Signing Information
   Elements into a URI Signing Package to construct a Signed Token and
   appending the Signed Token to the message.  Note it is possible to
   use some other algorithm and implementation as long as the same
   result is achieved.  An example for the Original URI,
   "http://example.com/folder/content-83112371/manifest.xml", is used to
   clarify the steps.

   Note that although the URI Signing for HAS mechanism defined in this
   document uses most of the Information Elements defined in
   [I-D.ietf-cdni-uri-signing] and is fully compatible with it, to make
   it easier for CDNs to distinguish between Signed Tokens and the
   Signed URIs specified in [I-D.ietf-cdni-uri-signing], the URI Signing
   Version field is set to '2' when Signed Token are used.

4.1.  Calculating the URI Signature (initial Signed Token)

   Calculate the URI Signature for use with a Signed Token by following
   the procedure below.

   Note: Although this document uses

   1.  Create a new buffer for constructing the Signed Token in the
       steps below.

   2.  Append the string "VER=2"

   3.  If time window enforcement is not needed, this step can be
       skipped.

       A.  If an information element was added to the message, append an
           "&" character.  Append the string "ET=".

       B.  Get the current time in seconds since epoch (as an integer).
           Add the validity time of the initial Signed Token in seconds
           as an integer.

       C.  Convert this integer to a string and append to the message.

       D.  Append an "&" character.  Append the string "ETS=".

       E.  Append the Expiration Time Setting (in seconds) in the form
           of a string to the message.  Note: the length of the
           Expiration Time Setting should be appropriate given the
           segment duration of the HTTP Adaptive Streaming content in
           question.  As an example, if the segment duration is 10
           seconds, the Expiration Time Setting should be at minimum 10
           seconds, and preferably a bit more.

   4.  If client IP enforcement is not needed, this step can be skipped.

       A.  If an information element was added to the message, append an
           "&" character.  Append the string "CIP=".

       B.  Convert the client's IP address in dotted decimal notation
           format (i.e. for IPv4 address) or canonical text

           representation (for IPv6 address [RFC5952]) to a string and
           append to the message.

   5.  If an information element was added to the message, append an "&"
       character.  Append the string "PP=".

   6.  Append the value of the Path Pattern in the form of a string to
       the message.  Note: the value of the Path Pattern element should
       be appropriate given the file and folder structure of the HTTP
       Adaptive Streaming content in question.  As an example, if the
       Original URI for the manifest file is 'http://example.com/folder/
       content-83112371/manifest.xml', a suitable Path Pattern might be
       '*/content-83112371/*/segment????.mp4'.

   7.  Depending on the type of key used to sign the URI, compute the
       message digest or digital signature for symmetric key or
       asymmetric keys, respectively.

       A.  For symmetric key, HMAC is used.

           1.  Obtain the shared key to be used for signing the URI.

           2.  If the key identifier is not needed, skip this step.  If
               an information element was added to the message, append
               an "&" character.  Append the string "KID=" in case a
               string-based Key ID is used, or "KID_NUM=" in case a
               numerical Key ID is used.  Append the key identifier
               (e.g. "example:keys:123" or "56128239") needed by the
               entity to locate the shared key for validating the URI
               signature.

           3.  Optional: If the hash function for the HMAC uses the
               default value ("SHA-256"), skip this step.  If an
               information element was added to the message, append an
               "&" character. append the string "HF=".  Append the
               string for the new type of hash function to be used.
               Note one MUST use the same hash function as communicated
               in the original concatenated information element string
               or one of the allowable hash functions designated by the
               CDNI metadata.

           4.  If an information element was added to the message,
               append an "&" character.  Append the string "MD=".  The
               message now contains the complete set of URI Signing
               Information Elements over which the URI Signature is
               computed (e.g.
               "VER=2&ET=1209422976&ETS=15&CIP=192.0.2.1&PP=*/content-
               83112371/*/segment????.mp4&KID=example:keys:123&MD=").

           5.  Compute the message digest using the HMAC algorithm and
               the default SHA-256 hash function, or another hash
               function if specified by the HF Information Element, with
               the shared key and message as the two inputs to the hash
               function.

           6.  Convert the message digest to its equivalent hexadecimal
               format.

           7.  Append the string for the message digest (e.g.
               "VER=2&ET=1209422976&ETS=15&CIP=192.0.2.1&PP=*/content-83
               112371/*/segment????.mp4&KID=example:keys:123&MD=d6117d7d
               b8a68bd59f6e7e3343484831acd8f23bbaa7f44b285a2f3bb6f02cfd"
               ).

       B.  For asymmetric keys, EC DSA is used.

           1.  Generate the EC private and public key pair.  Store the
               EC public key in a location that's reachable for any
               entity that needs to validate the URI signature.

           2.  If the key identifier is not needed, skip this step.  If
               an information element was added to the message, append
               an "&" character.  Append the string "KID=" in case a
               string-based Key ID is used, or "KID_NUM=" in case a
               numerical Key ID is used.  Append the key identifier
               (e.g. "http://example.com/public/keys/123") needed by the
               entity to locate the shared key for validating the URI
               signature.  Note that in the case the Key ID URI is a URL
               to a public key, the Key ID URI SHOULD only contain the
               "scheme name", "authority", and "path" parts (i.e. query
               string is not allowed).

           3.  Optional: If the digital signature algorithm uses the
               default value ("EC-DSA"), skip this step.  If an
               information element was added to the message, append an
               "&" character.  Append the string "DSA=".  Append the
               string denoting the new digital signature function.

           4.  If an information element was added to the message,
               append an "&" character.  Append the string "DS=".  The
               message now contains the complete set of URI Signing
               Information Elements over which the URI Signature is
               computed (e.g.
               "VER=2&ET=1209422976&ETS=15&CIP=192.0.2.1&PP=*/content-
               83112371/*/segment????.mp4&KID=example:keys:123&DS=").

           5.  Compute the message digest using SHA-1 (without a key)
               for the message.  Note: The digital signature generated
               in the next step is calculated over the SHA-1 message
               digest, instead of over the cleartype message, to reduce
               the length of the digital signature, and thereby the
               length of the Signed Token.  Since SHA-1 is not used for
               cryptographic purposes here, the security concerns around
               SHA-1 do not apply.

           6.  Compute the digital signature, using the EC-DSA algorithm
               by default or another algorithm if specified by the DSA
               Information Element, with the private EC key and message
               digest (obtained in previous step) as inputs.

           7.  Convert the digital signature to its equivalent
               hexadecimal format.

           8.  Append the string for the digital signature.  In the case
               where EC-DSA algorithm is used, this string contains the
               values for the 'r' and 's' parameters, delimited by ':'
               (e.g.
               "VER=2&ET=1209422976&ETS=15&CIP=192.0.2.1&PP=*/content-83
               112371/*/segment????.mp4&KID=example:keys:123&DS=r:CFB03E
               DB33810AB6C79EE3C47FBD86D227D702F25F66C01CF03F59F1E005668
               D:s:57ED0E8DF7E786C87E39177DD3398A7FB010E6A4C0DC8AA71331A
               929A29EA24E" )

4.2.  Packaging the URI Signature (initial Signed Token)

   The following steps depend on whether the Signed Token is
   communicated to the UA via an HTTP 3xx Redirection message or via an
   HTTP 2xx Successful message.  In the case of a redirection response,
   the Signed Token can be communicated as part of the query string
   component of the URL signalled via the Location header of the
   Redirection message.  In the case of a 2xx Successful message, the
   Signed Token can be communicated via either a dedicated header or,
   for legacy UAs, via the Set-Cookie header.

4.2.1.  Communicating the Signed Token in a HTTP 3xx Redirection message

   The following steps describe how the Signed Token can be communicated
   to the UA via an HTTP 3xx Redirection message.

   1.  Copy the entire Original URI into a buffer to hold the message.

   2.  Check if the Original URI already contains a query string.  If
       not, append a "?" character.  If yes, append an "&" character.

Internet-Draft          CDNI URI Signing for HAS             August 2015


   3.  Append the parameter name used to indicate the URI Signing
       Package Attribute, as communicated via the CDNI Metadata
       interface, followed by an "=".  If none is communicated by the
       CDNI Metadata interface, it defaults to "URISigningPackage".  For
       example, if the CDNI Metadata interface specifies "SIG", append
       the string "SIG=" to the message.

   4.  Encode the Signed Token by applying Base-64 Data Encoding
       [RFC4648] on the value of the Signed Token (e.g.  "RVQ9MTIwOTQyMj
       k3NiZhbXA7RVRTPTE1JmFtcDtDSVA9MTkyLjAuMi4xJmFtcDtQUD0qL2NvbnRlbnQ
       tODMxMTIzNzEvKi9zZWdtZW50Pz8/Py5tcDQmYW1wO0tJRD1leGFtcGxlOmtleXM6

       jNiYmFhN2Y0NGIyODVhMmYzYmI2ZjAyY2Zk").

   5.  Append the URI Signing token to the message (e.g.
       "http://example.com/folder/content-83112371/manifest.xml?URISigni
       ngPackage=RVQ9MTIwOTQyMjk3NiZhbXA7RVRTPTE1JmFtcDtDSVA9MTkyLjAuMi4

       TdlMzM0MzQ4NDgzMWFjZDhmMjNiYmFhN2Y0NGIyODVhMmYzYmI2ZjAyY2Zk").

   6.  Place the message in the Location header of the HTTP 3xx
       Redirection message returned to the UA.

4.2.2.  Communicating the Signed Token in a HTTP 2xx Successful message

   The following steps describe how the Signed Token can be communicated
   to the UA via an HTTP 2xx Successful message.

4.2.2.1.  Header-based

   The following steps are used in case the UA is expected to implement
   a mechanisms for extracting the Signed Token from the dedicated URI
   Signing HTTP Header and place in the query string component of the
   next request.

   1.  Encode the Signed Token by applying Base-64 Data Encoding
       [RFC4648] on the value of the Signed Token (e.g.  "RVQ9MTIwOTQyMj
       k3NiZhbXA7RVRTPTE1JmFtcDtDSVA9MTkyLjAuMi4xJmFtcDtQUD0qL2NvbnRlbnQ
       tODMxMTIzNzEvKi9zZWdtZW50Pz8/Py5tcDQmYW1wO0tJRD1leGFtcGxlOmtleXM6
       MTIzJmFtcDtNRD1kNjExN2Q3ZGI4YTY4YmQ1OWY2ZTdlMzM0MzQ4NDgzMWFjZDhmM
       jNiYmFhN2Y0NGIyODVhMmYzYmI2ZjAyY2Zk").

   2.  Place the value of the encoded Signed Token in the URI Signing
       Header of the HTTP 2xx Successful message of the content being
       returned to the UA.  Note: The HTTP Header name to use is
       communicated via the CDNI Metadata Interface or set via
       configuration.  Otherwise, it defaults to 'URISigningPackage'.

Internet-Draft          CDNI URI Signing for HAS             August 2015


4.2.2.2.  Cookie-based

   The following steps are used in combination with legacy UAs that do
   not support a dedicated URI Signing HTTP header.

   1.  Encode the Signed Token by applying Base-64 Data Encoding
       [RFC4648] on the value of the Signed Token (e.g.  "RVQ9MTIwOTQyMj
       k3NiZhbXA7RVRTPTE1JmFtcDtDSVA9MTkyLjAuMi4xJmFtcDtQUD0qL2NvbnRlbnQ
       tODMxMTIzNzEvKi9zZWdtZW50Pz8/Py5tcDQmYW1wO0tJRD1leGFtcGxlOmtleXM6
       MTIzJmFtcDtNRD1kNjExN2Q3ZGI4YTY4YmQ1OWY2ZTdlMzM0MzQ4NDgzMWFjZDhmM
       jNiYmFhN2Y0NGIyODVhMmYzYmI2ZjAyY2Zk").

   2.  Add a 'URISigningPackage' cookie to the HTTP 2xx Successful
       message of the content being returned to the UA, with the value
       set to the encoded Signed Token.

5.  Validating a Signed Token

   The process of validating a Signed Token can be divided into four
   sets of steps: first, extraction of the URI Signing information
   elements, then validation of the URI signature to ensure the
   integrity of the Signed Token, validation of the information elements
   to ensure proper enforcement of the distribution policy, and finally,
   generating a subsequent Signed Token and communicating it to the UA.

   In the algorithm below, the integrity of the Signed Token is
   confirmed before distribution policy enforcement because validation
   procedure would detect the right event when the URI is tampered with.
   Note it is possible to use some other algorithm and implementation as
   long as the same result is achieved.

5.1.  Information Element Extraction

   Extract the information elements embedded in the Signed URI or Signed
   Token.  Note that some steps are to be skipped if the corresponding
   URI Signing Information Elements are not embedded in the Signed URI
   or Signed Token.

   1.   Check if the query string component of the received URI contains
        the 'URISigningPackage' attribute.  If there are multiple
        instances of this attribute, the first one is used and the
        remaining ones are ignored.  This ensures that the Signed Token
        can be validated despite a client appending another instance of
        the URI Signing Package attribute.  If the query string
        component of the received URI does not contain the URI Signing
        Package attribute, check if the HTTP request contains a
        'URISigningPackage' cookie and use that as the URI Signing
        Package in the following steps.  If the request does not contain

Internet-Draft          CDNI URI Signing for HAS             August 2015


        the URI Signing Package query string attribute and does not
        contain a URISigningPackage cookie, the request is denied.

   2.   Decode the URI Signing Package using Base-64 Data Encoding
        [RFC4648] to obtain all the URI Signing Information Elements in
        the form of a concatenated string (e.g.  "VER=2&ET=1209422976&CI
        P=192.0.2.1&KID=example:keys:123&MD=1ecb1446a6431352aab0fb6e0dca
        30e30356593a97acb972202120dc482bddaf").

   3.   Extract the value from "VER", if the information element exists.
        Determine the version of the URI Signing algorithm used to
        process the Signed URI or Signed Token.  If the CDNI Metadata
        interface is used, check to see if the used version of the URI
        Signing algorithm is among the allowed set of URI Signing
        versions specified by the metadata.  If this is not the case,
        the request is denied.  If the information element is not in the
        information elements string, then it is assumed to be set to
        '1'.  In that case, the Signed URI validation mechanism
        specified in [I-D.ietf-cdni-uri-signing] should be followed
        instead of the Signed Token mechanism defined in this document.

   4.   If this value of the "VER" information element is set to a value
        unequal to '2', the URI Signing Package refers to a different
        version of URI Signing and the algorithm specified in this
        section shouldn't be used.

   5.   Extract the value from "MD", if the information element exists.
        The existence of this information element indicates a symmetric
        key is used.

   6.   Extract the value from "DS", if the information element exists.
        The existence of this information element indicates an
        asymmetric key is used.

   7.   If neither the "MD" or "DS" attribute exists, then no URI
        Signature exists and the request is denied.  If both the "MD"
        and the "DS" information elements are present, the Signed URI is
        considered to be malformed and the request is denied.

   8.   Extract the value from "CIP", if the information element exists.
        The existence of this information element indicates content
        delivery is enforced based on client IP address.

   9.   Extract the value from "ET", if the information element exists.
        The existence of this information element indicates content
        delivery is enforced based on time.

Internet-Draft          CDNI URI Signing for HAS             August 2015


   10.  Extract the value from "PP", if the information element exists.
        This information element is used to check whether there is a
        match between the path of the requested resource and the set of
        resources for which the Signed Token was generated.  If the
        information element is not in the information elements string,
        the request is deined.

   11.  Extract the value from the "KID" or "KID_NUM" information
        element, if they exist.  The existence of either of these
        information elements indicates a key can be referenced.  If both
        the "KID" and the "KID_NUM" information elements are present,
        the Signed URI is considered to be malformed and the request is
        denied.

   12.  Extract the value from the "HF" information element, if it
        exists.  The existence of this information element indicates a
        different hash function than the default.

   13.  Extract the value from the "DSA" information element, if it
        exists.  The existence of this information element indicates a
        different digital signature algorithm than the default.

   14.  Extract the value from "USCF", if the information element
        exists.  The existence of this information element indicates
        cookie-based communication for legacy UAs should be used for
        signalling the next Signed Token in case a HTTP 2xx Succcessful
        message is sent to the user.

   15.  Extract the value from "ETS", if the information element exists.
        This information element indicates the validity time of the next
        Signed Token in the chain.

5.2.  Signature Validation

   Validate the URI Signature of the Signed Token.

   1.  Create a new buffer for validating the Signed Token in the steps
       below.

   2.  Copy the decoded contents of the Signed Token in the buffer.

   3.  Depending on the type of key used to create the Signed Token,
       validate the message digest or digital signature for symmetric
       key or asymmetric keys, respectively.

       A.  For symmetric key, HMAC algorithm is used.

           a.  If either the "KID" or "KID_NUM" information element
               exists, validate that the key identifier is in the
               allowable KID set as listed in the CDNI metadata or
               configuration.  The request is denied when the key
               identifier is not allowed.  If neither the "KID" or
               "KID_NUM" information element is present in the received
               URI Signing Package, obtain the shared key via CDNI
               metadata or configuration.

           b.  If the "HF" information element exists, validate that the
               hash function is in the allowable "HF" set as listed in
               the CDNI metadata or configuration.  The request is
               denied when the hash function is not allowed.  If the
               "HF" information element is not in the received URI
               Signing Package, the default hash function is SHA-256.

           c.  Extract the value from the "MD" information element.
               This is the received message digest.

           d.  Convert the message digest to binary format.  This will
               be used to compare with the computed value later.

           e.  Remove the value part of the "MD" information element
               (but not the '=' character) from the message.  The
               message is ready for validation of the message digest
               (e.g. "://example.com/content.mov?VER=2&ET=1209422976&CIP
               =192.0.2.1&KID=example:keys:123&MD=").

           f.  Compute the message digest using the HMAC algorithm with
               the shared key and message as the two inputs to the hash
               function.

           g.  Compare the result with the received message digest to
               validate the Signed URI or Signed Token.  If there is no
               match, the request is denied.

       B.  For asymmetric keys, a digital signature function is used.

           a.  If either the "KID" or "KID_NUM" information element
               exists, validate that the key identifier is in the
               allowable KID set as listed in the CDNI metadata or
               configuration.  The request is denied when the key
               identifier is not allowed.  If neither the "KID" or
               "KID_NUM" information element is present in the received
               URI Signing Package, obtain the public key via CDNI
               metadata or configuration.

           b.  If the "DSA" information element exists, validate that
               the digital signature algorithm is in the allowable "DSA"
               set as listed in the CDNI metadata or configuration.  The
               request is denied when the DSA is not allowed.  If the
               "DSA" information element is not in the received URI
               Signing Package, the default DSA is EC-DSA.

           c.  Extract the value from the "DS" information element.
               This is the received digital signature.

           d.  Convert the digital signature to binary format.  This
               will be used for verification later.

           e.  Remove the value part of the "DS" information element
               (but not the '=' character) from the message.  The
               message is ready for validation of the digital signature
               (e.g. "://example.com/content.mov?VER=2&ET=1209422976&CIP
               =192.0.2.1&KID=http://example.com/public/keys/123&DS=").

           f.  Compute the message digest using SHA-1 (without a key)
               for the message.

           g.  Verify the digital signature using the digital signature
               function (e.g.  EC-DSA) with the public key, received
               digital signature, and message digest (obtained in
               previous step) as inputs.  This validates the Signed URI
               or Signed Token.  If signature is determined to be
               invalid, the request is denied.

5.3.  Distribution Policy Enforcement

   Note that some of the steps below are to be skipped if the
   corresponding URI Signing Information Elements are not in the
   received URI Signing Package.  The absence of a given Enforcement
   Information Element indicates enforcement of its purpose is not
   necessary in the CSP's distribution policy.  The exception is the
   Path Pattern Information Element, which is mandatory for Signed
   Tokens.

   1.  If the "CIP" information element exists, validate that the
       request came from the same IP address as indicated in the "CIP"
       information element.  If the IP address is incorrect, the request
       is denied.

   2.  If the "ET" information element exists, validate that the request
       arrived before expiration time based on the "ET" information
       element.  If the time expired, the request is denied.

Internet-Draft          CDNI URI Signing for HAS             August 2015


   3.  Validate that the requested resource is in the allowed set by
       matching the received URI against the Path Pattern information
       element.  If there is no match, the request is denied.

5.4.  Subsequent Signed Token Generation

   The following steps describe how to generate a subsequent Signed
   Token in a chain of Signed Tokens.  Note that the process for
   generating an initial Signed Token is described in Section 4 and the
   process below is used for generating all subsequent tokens after the
   initial one.

   The process of generating a subsequent Signed Token can be divided
   into two sets of steps: first, calculating the URI Signature and
   then, packaging the URI Signature along with the URI Signing
   Information Elements into a URI Signing Package to construct a new
   Signed Token and appending the Signed Token to the message.  Note it
   is possible to use some other algorithm and implementation as long as
   the same result is achieved.

5.4.1.  Calculating the URI Signature (subsequent Signed Token)

   Calculate the URI Signature for use with the new Signed Token by
   following the procedure below.

   1.  Create a new buffer for constructing the new Signed Token in the
       steps below.

   2.  Append the string "VER=2"

   3.  If the received URI Signing Package does not contain the "ET"
       information element, skip this step.

       A.  If an information element was added to the message, append an
           "&" character.  Append the string "ET=".

       B.  If the received URI Signing Package contains the "ETS"
           information element, perform this step.

           1.  Get the value of the "ETS" information element and
               convert it to an integer.

           2.  Get the current time in seconds sinds epoch (as an
               integer) and add the value of the "ETS" information
               element as seconds.

           3.  Convert the result to a string and append it to the
               message.

           4.  Append the "&" character and the "ETS=" string.

           5.  Append the value of the "ETS" information element in the
               received URI Signing Package.

       C.  If the received URI Signing Package does not contain the
           "ETS" information element, perform this step.  Get the value
           of the "ET" information element from the original
           concatenated information element string and append it to the
           message.

   4.  If the received URI Signing Package does not contain the "CIP"
       information element, skip this step.

       A.  If an information element was added to the message, append an
           "&" character.  Append the string "CIP=".

       B.  Append the value of the "CIP" information element in the
           received URI Signing Package.

   5.  If an information element was added to the message, append an "&"
       character.  Append the string "PP=".  Append the value of the
       "PP" information element in the received URI Signing Package.

   6.  Depending on the type of key used to sign the received Signed
       Token, compute the message digest or digital signature for
       symmetric key or asymmetric keys, respectively.

       A.  For symmetric key, HMAC is used.

           1.  Obtain the shared key to be used for signing the Signed
               Token.

           2.  If the key identifier is not needed, skip this step.  If
               an information element was added to the message, append
               an "&" character.  Append the string "KID=" in case a
               string-based Key ID is used, or "KID_NUM=" in case a
               numerical Key ID is used.  Append the key identifier
               (e.g. "example:keys:123" or "56128239") needed by the
               entity to locate the shared key for validating the URI
               signature.

           3.  Optional: If the hash function for the HMAC uses the
               default value ("SHA-256"), skip this step.  If an
               information element was added to the message, append an
               "&" character. append the string "HF=".  Append the
               string for the new type of hash function to be used.
               Note one MUST use the same hash function as communicated

               in the received URI Signing Package or one of the
               allowable hash functions designated by the CDNI metadata.

           4.  If an information element was added to the message,
               append an "&" character.  Append the string "MD=".  The
               message now contains the complete set of URI Signing
               Information Elements over which the URI Signature is
               computed (e.g.
               "VER=2&ET=1209422976&ETS=15&CIP=192.0.2.1&PP=*/content-
               83112371/*/segment????.mp4&KID=example:keys:123&MD=").

           5.  Compute the message digest using the HMAC algorithm and
               the default SHA-256 hash function, or another hash
               function if specified by the HF Information Element, with
               the shared key and message as the two inputs to the hash
               function.

           6.  Convert the message digest to its equivalent hexadecimal
               format.

           7.  Append the string for the message digest (e.g.
               "VER=2&ET=1209422976&ETS=15&CIP=192.0.2.1&PP=*/content-83
               112371/*/segment????.mp4&KID=example:keys:123&MD=d6117d7d
               b8a68bd59f6e7e3343484831acd8f23bbaa7f44b285a2f3bb6f02cfd"
               ).

       B.  For asymmetric keys, EC DSA is used.

           1.  Generate the EC private and public key pair.  Store the
               EC public key in a location that's reachable for any
               entity that needs to validate the URI signature.

           2.  If the key identifier is not needed, skip this step.  If
               an information element was added to the message, append
               an "&" character.  Append the string "KID=" in case a
               string-based Key ID is used, or "KID_NUM=" in case a
               numerical Key ID is used.  Append the key identifier
               (e.g. "http://example.com/public/keys/123") needed by the
               entity to locate the shared key for validating the URI
               signature.  Note that in the case the Key ID URI is a URL
               to a public key, the Key ID URI SHOULD only contain the
               "scheme name", "authority", and "path" parts (i.e. query
               string is not allowed).

           3.  Optional: If the digital signature algorithm uses the
               default value ("EC-DSA"), skip this step.  If an
               information element was added to the message, append an

               "&" character.  Append the string "DSA=".  Append the
               string denoting the new digital signature function.

           4.  If an information element was added to the message,
               append an "&" character.  Append the string "DS=".  The
               message now contains the complete set of URI Signing
               Information Elements over which the URI Signature is
               computed (e.g.
               "VER=2&ET=1209422976&ETS=15&CIP=192.0.2.1&PP=*/content-
               83112371/*/segment????.mp4&KID=example:keys:123&DS=").

           5.  Compute the message digest using SHA-1 (without a key)
               for the message.  Note: The digital signature generated
               in the next step is calculated over the SHA-1 message
               digest, instead of over the cleartype message, to reduce
               the length of the digital signature, and thereby the
               length of the URI Signing Package Attribute and the
               resulting Signed URI.  Since SHA-1 is not used for
               cryptographic purposes here, the security concerns around
               SHA-1 do not apply.

           6.  Compute the digital signature, using the EC-DSA algorithm
               by default or another algorithm if specified by the DSA
               Information Element, with the private EC key and message
               digest (obtained in previous step) as inputs.

           7.  Convert the digital signature to its equivalent
               hexadecimal format.

           8.  Append the string for the digital signature.  In the case
               where EC-DSA algorithm is used, this string contains the
               values for the 'r' and 's' parameters, delimited by ':'
               (e.g.
               "VER=2&ET=1209422976&ETS=15&CIP=192.0.2.1&PP=*/content-83
               112371/*/segment????.mp4&KID=example:keys:123&DS=r:CFB03E

               929A29EA24E" )

5.4.2.  Packaging the URI Signature (subsequent Signed Token)

   The following steps depend on whether the Signed Token is
   communicated to the UA via an HTTP 3xx Redirection message or via an
   HTTP 2xx Successful message.  In the case of a redirection response,
   the Signed Token can be communicated as part of the query string
   component of the URL signalled via the Location header of the
   Redirection message.  In the case of a 2xx Successful message, the
   Signed Token can be communicated via either a dedicated HTTP header

Internet-Draft          CDNI URI Signing for HAS             August 2015


   or, for legacy UAs, via the Set-Cookie header.  If the received URI
   Signing Package contains the 'USCF' Information Element, the new
   Signed Token MUST be communicated via the Cookie method.  If the
   received URI Signing Package does NOT contain the 'USCF' Information
   Element, the new Signed Token SHALL be communicated via the dedicated
   HTTP header.

5.4.2.1.  Communicating the Signed Token in a HTTP 3xx Redirection
          message

   The following steps describe how the new Signed Token can be
   communicated to the UA via an HTTP 3xx Redirection message.

   1.  Copy the target URI of the HTTP 3xx Redirection message into a
       buffer to hold the message.

   2.  Check if the URI already contains a query string.  If not, append
       a "?" character.  If yes, append an "&" character.

   3.  Append the parameter name used to indicate the URI Signing
       Package Attribute, as communicated via the CDNI Metadata
       interface, followed by an "=".  If none is communicated by the
       CDNI Metadata interface, it defaults to "URISigningPackage".  For
       example, if the CDNI Metadata interface specifies "SIG", append
       the string "SIG=" to the message.

   4.  Encode the Signed Token by applying Base-64 Data Encoding
       [RFC4648] on the value of the Signed Token (e.g.  "RVQ9MTIwOTQyMj
       k3NiZhbXA7RVRTPTE1JmFtcDtDSVA9MTkyLjAuMi4xJmFtcDtQUD0qL2NvbnRlbnQ

       jNiYmFhN2Y0NGIyODVhMmYzYmI2ZjAyY2Zk").

   5.  Append the URI Signing token to the message (e.g.
       "http://example.com/folder/content-83112371/manifest.xml?URISigni
       ngPackage=RVQ9MTIwOTQyMjk3NiZhbXA7RVRTPTE1JmFtcDtDSVA9MTkyLjAuMi4

       TdlMzM0MzQ4NDgzMWFjZDhmMjNiYmFhN2Y0NGIyODVhMmYzYmI2ZjAyY2Zk").

   6.  Place the message in the Location header of the HTTP 3xx
       Redirection message returned to the UA.

5.4.2.2.  Communicating the Signed Token in a HTTP 2xx Successful
          message

   The following steps describe how the new Signed Token can be
   communicated to the UA via an HTTP 2xx Successful message.

5.4.2.2.1.  Header-based

   If the received URI Signing Package does NOT contain the 'USCF'
   Information Element, the new Signed Token SHALL be communicated via
   the following method.

   1.  Encode the Signed Token by applying Base-64 Data Encoding
       [RFC4648] on the value of the Signed Token (e.g.  "RVQ9MTIwOTQyMj
       k3NiZhbXA7RVRTPTE1JmFtcDtDSVA9MTkyLjAuMi4xJmFtcDtQUD0qL2NvbnRlbnQ
       tODMxMTIzNzEvKi9zZWdtZW50Pz8/Py5tcDQmYW1wO0tJRD1leGFtcGxlOmtleXM6
       MTIzJmFtcDtNRD1kNjExN2Q3ZGI4YTY4YmQ1OWY2ZTdlMzM0MzQ4NDgzMWFjZDhmM
       jNiYmFhN2Y0NGIyODVhMmYzYmI2ZjAyY2Zk").

   2.  Place the value of the encoded Signed Token in the URI Signing
       Header of the HTTP 2xx Successful message of the content being
       returned to the UA.  Note: The HTTP Header name to use is
       communicated via the CDNI Metadata Interface or set via
       configuration.  Otherwise, it defaults to 'URISigningPackage'.

5.4.2.2.2.  Cookie-based

   If the received URI Signing Package contains the 'USCF' Information
   Element, the new Signed Token MUST be communicated via the following
   method.

   1.  Encode the Signed Token by applying Base-64 Data Encoding
       [RFC4648] on the value of the Signed Token (e.g.  "RVQ9MTIwOTQyMj
       k3NiZhbXA7RVRTPTE1JmFtcDtDSVA9MTkyLjAuMi4xJmFtcDtQUD0qL2NvbnRlbnQ
       tODMxMTIzNzEvKi9zZWdtZW50Pz8/Py5tcDQmYW1wO0tJRD1leGFtcGxlOmtleXM6
       MTIzJmFtcDtNRD1kNjExN2Q3ZGI4YTY4YmQ1OWY2ZTdlMzM0MzQ4NDgzMWFjZDhmM
       jNiYmFhN2Y0NGIyODVhMmYzYmI2ZjAyY2Zk").

   2.  Add a 'URISigningPackage' cookie to the HTTP 2xx Successful
       message of the content being returned to the UA, with the value
       set to the encoded Signed Token.

6.  IANA Considerations
