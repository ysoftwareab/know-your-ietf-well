1. Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects for Traffic Engineered
   Tunnels, for example, Multi-Protocol Label Switched Paths ([1], [2]).
   The MIB module that this memo defines allows one to configure TE
   Tunnels, assign one or more paths to a Tunnel, and monitor
   operational aspects of the Tunnel, such as the number of octets and
   packets that have passed through the Tunnel.

   As it stands, this MIB module can only be used to configure or
   monitor a TE Tunnel at its ingress.  The extension of this module for
   use at other points of a Tunnel is for further study.


2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [4].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].


3. Overview of the MIB Module

   The Traffic Engineering MIB module consists of four parts:
      1) Traffic Engineering information;
      2) a table of Traffic Engineering Tunnels;
      3) a table of Paths that tunnels take;
      4) a table of Hops that make up a tunnel path.

   The MIB module also has statements for minimal and full compliance.

   The following subsections give an overview of each part.  All objects
   are mandatory.  For minimal compliance, all objects MAY be
   implemented read only; for full compliance, all objects must be
   implemented to their stated MAX-ACCESS capabilities.  Notifications
   are optional.

3.1. Traffic Engineering Information

   This part contains information about the Link State Protocols used to
   carry TE information, the signalling protocols used to set up Traffic
   Tunnels, the number of Traffic Tunnels that have been configured and
   that are operational, and a mapping of Administrative Group (called
   Resource Classes in [1]) numbers to names.

3.2. Traffic Tunnel Information

   This part contains a table of Traffic Tunnels and information about
   each one.  This information includes the Tunnel name, its
   configuration information, its operational information, and the
   active path(s) that the Tunnel takes.

   Configuration information includes the end points of the Traffic
   Tunnel, and the number of configured paths for the Traffic Tunnel.

   Operational information includes the current state (up/down), the
   count of octets and packets sent on the Traffic Tunnel, how long it
   has been up, and how many state transitions the Traffic Tunnel has
   had.

   Operational path information includes the number of operational
   paths, the number of path changes, and when the last path change was.

3.3. Path Information

   A Tunnel is a logical entity.  An instantiation of a Tunnel is one or
   more Paths; each Path has a route (also called Explicit Route) or
   sequence of hops.  A Path is indexed by a dual index: the primary
   index is that of the Tunnel to which this Path belongs; the secondary
   index is of the Path itself.

   The configured information for a Path consists of the constraints for
   the Path and a configured route.

   The operational information consists of the Path status, as well as
   the computed route (i.e., the route that was computed to satisfy the
   constraints), and the actual path as recorded by the signaling
   protocol.

3.4. Hop Information

   A path consists of a sequence of hops; a hop can be loose (meaning
   that the path eventually traverses the specified node) or strict
   (meaning that the specified node and possibly link must be the next
   node in the path).  A hop can be specified as an IPv4 address, an



Kompella, K.                 Standards Track                    [Page 4]

Internet Draft          A Traffic Engineering MIB          February 2004


   IPv6 address, an Autonomous System number or an unnumbered interface
   index [8].

   The Hop Table contains all hops for all paths on a given router.  It
   is organized as follows.  There is a primary index that identifies a
   list of hops and a secondary index that identifies individual hops.
   Thus, to get the sequence of recorded hops for a path, one looks up
   the path's tePathRecordedRoute, which is a primary index into the Hop
   Table.  Then to get the list of actual hops in order for the recorded
   path, one uses a secondary index of 1, 2, ....

3.5. Relationship with Other MIB Modules

   A TE Tunnel can extend objects from two other MIB modules; one is the
   Interfaces MIB [11], and the other is the IP Tunnel MIB [12].  The
   mechanism for doing so is to assign the TE Tunnel index
   (teTunnelIndex) with a valid ifIndex value in ifTable.

   If a TE Tunnel is deemed an interface, a new interface object is
   created and assigned an ifIndex value in ifTable.  Then a TE Tunnel
   object is created, setting teTunnelIndex to the same value as the
   interface index.

   If (and only if) a TE Tunnel is considered an interface, it may also
   be considered an IP tunnel (if the encapsulation of the TE Tunnel is
   IP).  In that case, the interface associated with the TE Tunnel
   should have its ifType set to tunnel(131).

   If a TE Tunnel is not considered an interface, then the TE Tunnel
   index (teTunnelIndex) SHOULD be set to a value at least 2^24, so that
   it is distinct from normal interfaces.


4. Creating, Modifying and Deleting a TE Tunnel

   To create a TE Tunnel, one first obtains a free Tunnel index using
   the object teNextTunnelIndex.  One then creates the Tunnel, including
   all parameters, either as createAndGo or createAndWait.  Then, TE
   Paths for this Tunnel can be created using the teTunnelNextPathIndex
   object, again as createAndGo or createAndWait.  A particular Path is
   computed and signaled when both the Path and the enclosing Tunnel
   have RowStatus 'active'.

   To build a Path's configured route, one first gets a free PathHop
   index using teNextPathHopIndex, then builds the route hop-by-hop
   using the secondary index, setting the AddrType, Address, and HopType
   for each Hop.  Finally, one sets the tePathConfiguredRoute in the
   Path to the PathHop index obtained.

Internet Draft          A Traffic Engineering MIB          February 2004


   Modifying certain properties of a TE Tunnel or a TE Path may require
   setting the RowStatus of the Tunnel (or Path) to 'notInService'
   before making the changes, and then setting the RowStatus of the
   Tunnel (or Path) back to 'active' to re-signal all Paths of the
   Tunnel (or the modified Path).

   A TE Tunnel and all its Paths can be deleted by setting the Tunnel's
   RowStatus to 'destroy'.  A specific Path within a Tunnel can be
   destroyed by setting just the Path's RowStatus to 'destroy'.

8. Security Considerations

   This MIB module relates to the configuration and management of
   Traffic Engineering tunnels.  The unauthorized manipulation of fields
   in the following tables: teAdminGroupTable, teTunnelTable,
   tePathTable, and tePathHopTable may lead to tunnels flapping, tunnel
   paths being changed, or traffic being disrupted.  In addition, if
   these tables are read by unauthorized parties, the information can be
   used to trace traffic patterns, traffic volumes, and tunnels paths;
   this may be considered proprietary and confidential information by
   some providers.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   teAdminGroupTable: changing this will affect the semantics of include
   and exclude constraints, and hence traffic taking unintended routes;

   teTunnelTable: changing this affects many properties of traffic
   tunnels;

   tePathTable: changing this affects the constraints (including
   bandwidth) of tunnel paths, as well as the status of the path;

   tePathHopTable: changing this affects the route followed by a traffic
   tunnel path.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

      teTunnelTable:  describes tunnel endpoints and traffic volumes;
      tePathTable:    describes path properties;

      tePathHopTable: describes path routes.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [4], section 8), including full
   support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication
   and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
