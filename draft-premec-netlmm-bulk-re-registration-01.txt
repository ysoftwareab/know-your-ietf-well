Abstract 

   The Proxy Mobile IPv6 specification requires the Mobile Access 
   Gateway (MAG) to send a separate Proxy Binding Update (PBU) message 
   to the Local Mobility Agent (LMA) for each mobile node (MN) to renew 
   the MN's mobility binding. This document defines a mechanism by which 
   a MAG can update the mobility bindings of multiple MNs attached to it 
   with a single PBU message to the serving LMA. This mechanism is also 
   intended to be used by a MAG to re-establish bindings at a new LMA 
   when its old LMA fails.

1. Introduction  

   According to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIP6) specification [Gun2008], a 
   netlmm domain is defined as a network which provides a network based 
   IP mobility service by deploying the PMIP6 protocol. A MAG performs 
   the mobility related signaling on behalf of a MN by sending the Proxy 
   Binding Update (PBU) message to a LMA. When the binding lifetime of a 
   particular MN is close to expiry, the MAG renews the registration of 
   the MN by sending a PBU message, to the LMA, requesting the extension 
   of the binding lifetime. 

   A single LMA serves multiple MAGs and the capacity of the LMA in 
   terms of the number of attached MNs can be quite large. It can be 
   expected that LMA capacity in managed networks may easily exceed 
   hundreds of thousands or more attached MNs.  

   The following simple formula gives an estimate of the average number 
   of re-registration transactions per second as a function of the 
   number of registered MNs and the binding lifetime period: 

   transactions/sec = (number of registered MNs) / (binding lifetime*4) 

   For 50.000 MNs and the binding lifetime of half an hour this gives: 
   50000 MNs / 1800 sec = 27,7 transactions/sec 

   Based on the above formula it is apparent that the default re-
   registration process where the MAG sends a separate message for each 
   MN is inefficient or suboptimal. These re-registration messages 
   consume significant network resources both in terms of processing 
   power at the LMA and MAG and network bandwidth. In addition, since 
   the registration messages are sent per MN, there is no efficient way 
   for the MAG to recover from the failure of an LMA. It needs to resend 
   registration messages for each MN attached to it, towards a new LMA. 
   This increases the service disruption interval. 

   This document proposes an optimization of the re-registration process 
   by which the signaling load for re-registration can be reduced to a 
   single transaction per MAG, irrespective of the number of attached 
   MNs. 

   A MAG requests a bulk re-registration for a set of MNs by sending a 
   single PBU message with a new bulk re-registration flag (B) set to 1.

   The LMA extends the binding lifetime of MNs that are currently 
   attached to that MAG and meet the criteria contained in the renewals 
   request. If no current binding cache entry exists, the LMA creates 
   new bindings for the MNs listed in the bulk registration message. The 
   LMA indicates success of a bulk re-registration by responding with a 
   PBAck message with the bulk re-registration flag (B) set to 1. By 
   using this method, the MAG and LMA accomplish the re-registration of 
   MNs attached to a MAG in a single transaction. The number of re-
   registration transactions at the LMA becomes independent of the 
   number of attached MNs; instead it is dependent only on the number of 
   MAGs. 

    

2. Terminology 

   General mobility related terminology is defined in [RFC3775]. 
   Additional PMIP6 specific terminology can be found in [Gun2008]. 

   netlmm domain 
       Network providing the network based IP mobility service as 
       defined in [Gun2008]. 

   PMIP6 
       Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol specified in [Gun2008]. 

   Bulk re-registration  
       PBU/PBAck message exchange where the bulk re-registration flag 
       (B) is set to 1.  

   bulk re-registration set 
       a set containing the MNs to which the request for bulk  
       re-registration applies.  

    

3. Bulk Re-registration Overview 

   The bulk re-registration mechanism allows the MAG and LMA to extend 
   the binding lifetime for a number of MNs with a single transaction. 
   The MAG and LMA maintain a set of MNs that can be re-registered in  
   bulk mode. This set is called a bulk re-registration set and is a 
   subset of the MNs attached to a MAG. Initially the bulk re-
   registration set is empty. MAG requests to add individual MNs to this 
   set by sending a regular PBU message that identifies an individual MN 
   and additionally the bulk re-registration flag in the message is set 

 
 
Premec                 Expires January 14, 2009                [Page 4] 

Internet-Draft        PMIP6 bulk re-registration              July 2008 
    

   to 1. Based on the received bulk re-registration bit the LMA adds the 
   MN to the bulk re-registration set and responds with the PBAck 
   message with the bulk re-registration flag (B) set to 1.  

   Once there is a non-empty bulk re-registration set, MAG can request 
   to extend the binding lifetime of some or all MNs that are part of 
   the bulk re-registration set by sending a PBU message with bulk re-
   registration flag set to 1 and omitting any options that would 
   identify an individual MN. In particular, the MAG may omit both the 
   MN ID (Mobile Node Identifier) option and the HNP (Home Network 
   Prefix) option in which case the MAG requests bulk re-registration of 
   all MNs in the bulk re-registration set. If the bulk registration 
   message is being sent to recover from an LMA failure the MAG MUST 
   explicitly identify all the MNs that are included in the bulk 
   registration set and provide all the mobility options that need to be 
   included in an initial PBU. Due to the size of these options, the MAG 
   may not be able to fit all the MNs attached to it into a single BU. 
   In this case the MAG will split the MNs across multiple PBUs. The 
   receiving LMA can use the information included in these bulk PBUs to 
   recreate the bul registration set, so that the MAG can renew the MNs' 
   lifetimes later with a single PBU. 

   There may be different triggers that cause the MAG to request a bulk 
   re-registration. Typically the trigger is the binding lifetime expiry 
   of a MN that is a member of a bulk re-registration set. There could 
   be other triggers as well, but they may be implementation or domain 
   specific and outside the scope of this specification. 

   The MAG may restrict the set of MNs to which the request for bulk re-
   registration applies by including additional mobility options in the 
   PBU message that act as a filter. In this case only those MNs from 
   the bulk re-registration set which match the imposed restrictions 
   will be re-registered in a bulk mode. This filtering restriction is 
   valid only for the duration of the current re-registration 
   transaction. The binding cache entries of MNs that are members of 
   bulk re-registration set but not matching the filter will be left 
   unaffected. Following options may be used as a filter in a bulk re-
   registration request: 

   1. Mobile Node Identifier (MN ID) option 
      This option can be used to select only MNs belonging to particular 
      domain, for example, by setting it to "@example.com". 

   2. Home Network Prefix (HNP) option 
      This option can be used to select MNs whose HNP matches the 
      indicated prefix for the first Prefix Length bits.

Internet-Draft        PMIP6 bulk re-registration              July 2008 
    

   3. Service Selection option [RFC5149] 
      This option can be used to select MNs whose Service Selection 
      option in the binding cache entry exactly matches the requested 
      Service Selection option in the PBU. 

   4. Vendor-Specific Mobility option [RFC5094] 
      This option can be used to select MNs whose Vendor-Specific option 
      in the binding cache entry matches the requested Vendor-Specific 
      option in the PBU. 

   If MN's binding cache entry does not match all of the filtering 
   options from the bulk re-registration request, then it is not 
   affected by this bulk re-registration operation. 

   The LMA extends the mobility binding of all MNs from the bulk re-
   registration set that meet the filtering criteria and responds with 
   PBAck message with the bulk re-registration flag set to 1. The LMA 
   includes in its response the same mobility options that were included 
   in the request. 

   A MAG may remove a MN from a bulk re-registration set by sending a 
   regular PBU message identifying the MN to be removed and with the 
   bulk re-registration flag set to 0. 

   When requested to add a MN to the bulk re-registration set, the LMA 
   may reject the request. In this case the LMA processes the PBU 
   message as if the bulk re-registration flag was not set and responds 
   with PBAck message where the bulk re-registration flag is set to 0. 

      

4. Message formats 

   This section introduces extensions to PBU and PBAck messages used in 
   this specification.

                   Figure 1 Proxy Binding Update message 

   A Binding Update message that is sent by a MAG to a LMA is referred 
   to as the "Proxy Binding Update" message; it is defined in the 
   [Gun2008]. A new flag (B) is included in the Binding Update message. 

   Bulk Re-registration Flag (B) 

   If the mobility options included in the message identify a single MN 
   and if the bulk re-registration flag (B) is set to 1, then the PBU 
   message is a request to add the MN to the bulk re-registration set. 
   If the bulk re-registration flag (B) is set to 0, then the PBU 
   message is sent to remove the MN from the bulk re-registration set. 

   If bulk re-registration flag (B) is set to 1 and the included 
   mobility options do not identify a single MN, then the PBU message is 
   a request to extend the lifetime of the MNs contained in the bulk re-
   registration set and whose binding cache entries match the mobility 
   options from the message. 

   Mobility Options 

   For descriptions of these options, refer to [Gun2008]. When the bulk 
   re-registration flag is set to 1, the PBU message without Mobile Node 
   Identifier option and/or without HNP option is valid and is processed 
   as described in section 3.

         Figure 2 Proxy Binding Acknowledgment message 

   A Binding Acknowledgment message that is sent by a LMA to a MAG is 
   referred to as the "Proxy Binding Acknowledgment" message; it is 
   defined in the [Gun2008]. A new flag (B) is included in the Binding 
   Acknowledgment message. 

   Bulk Re-registration Flag (B) 

   A new flag (B) is included in the Binding Acknowledgment message to       
   indicate to the MAG that the requested bulk re-registration operation 
   was successful. The flag MUST NOT be set to the value of 1 if it was 
   not set to 1 in the corresponding PBU message. 

   Mobility Options 

   For descriptions of these options, refer to [Gun2008]. When the bulk 
   re-registration flag was set to 1 in the PBU message and Mobile Node 
   Identifier option and/or HNP option were not included, then the PBAck 
   message is also sent without those mobility options as described in 
   section 3.  

    

5. MAG Operation 

   When a new MN attaches to a MAG, the MAG SHALL register the MN with 
   the LMA by sending the PBU message formatted as described in 
   [Gun2008]. Additionally, the MAG MAY set the bulk re-registration 

 
 
Premec                 Expires January 14, 2009                [Page 8] 

Internet-Draft        PMIP6 bulk re-registration              July 2008 
    

   flag (B) in the PBU message to 1 to request the LMA to add the MN to 
   the set of MNs re-registered in a bulk mode. The decision to request 
   bulk re-registration mode for a MN is a matter of local policy at the 
   MAG and is outside the scope of this specification. 

   The MAG SHALL add the MN to its bulk re-registration set when it 
   receives a PBAck message with the bulk re-registration bit set to 1 
   and if the corresponding PBU message was requesting the LMA to add 
   the MN to the bulk re-registration set. The MAG SHALL maintain a 
   separate bulk re-registration set for each LMA. 

   When the binding lifetime of any MN contained in the bulk re-
   registration set is about to expire, the MAG SHALL request the bulk 
   re-registration by sending the PBU message with a bulk re-
   registration flag set to 1. Mobility options in such PBU message 
   SHALL NOT identify an individual MN.  

   In addition, the MAG MAY trigger a bulk re-registration at any time. 
   The policy and exact conditions for these additional triggers are 
   outside of scope of this specification. 

   A MAG MAY omit HNP and MN ID options from a PBU message requesting 
   bulk re-registration. 

   A MAG MAY include mobility options in a PBU requesting a bulk re-
   registration to restrict the set of MNs updated by this transaction. 
   In this case the set of MNs affected by this bulk re-registration 
   operation is the subset of MNs contained in a bulk re-registration 
   set whose binding cache entries match the mobility options included 
   in the PBU message, as described in section 3.  

   If the bulk registration message is being sent to recover from an LMA 
   failure the MAG MUST explicitly identify all the MNs that are 
   included in the bulk registration set and provide all the mobility 
   options that need to be included in an initial PBU. Due to the size 
   of these options, the MAG may not be able to fit all the MNs attached 
   to it into a single BU. In this case the MAG MUST split the MNs 
   across multiple BUs. 

   When the MAG receives a PBAck message indicating success with the 
   bulk re-registration bit set to 1 in response to a PBU message 
   requesting the bulk re-registration, the MAG SHALL update the binding 
   lifetime of all affected MNs to the lifetime value contained in the 
   PBAck message. If in the case of bulk re-registration the PBAck 
   message repeatedly indicates an error, the MAG SHALL fall back to 
   individual re-registration mode.

   After successfully processing the PBAck message indicating successful 
   re-registration in bulk mode, the MAG MAY start a single timer to 
   oversee the binding lifetime of all attached MNs served by the LMA to 
   which it sent the bulk PBU message.  

   If the MAG sets the bulk re-registration bit to 1 in a PBU message 
   but the bulk re-registration bit (B) is set to 0 in a PBAck message, 
   the MAG SHALL process the PBAck message as per [Gun2008]. In 
   addition, the MAG SHALL infer that the LMA does not support bulk re-
   registration procedure. The MAG SHALL switch to regular, per-MN re-
   registration mode as described in [Gun2008]. The MAG MAY retry the 
   bulk re-registration procedure after sufficient time has elapsed from 
   the previous unsuccessful bulk re-registration. This amount of time 
   SHOULD be configurable at the MAG. 

   If the PBAck message indicates success and it contains the MN ID and 
   HNP options, the MAG SHALL update the binding of the MN indicated by 
   the MN ID and HNP options, regardless of the value of the bulk re-
   registration bit (B) in the PBAck message. 

    

6. LMA operation 

   When the LMA receives a PBU message with a bulk re-registration bit 
   (B) set to 1 and if the message contains MN ID and/or HNP options 
   identifying a single MN, the LMA SHALL first process the PBU message 
   as per [Gun2008]. Upon successful processing of the message, if the 
   bulk re-registration flag is set in the message, the LMA SHALL 
   continue processing of the PBU message as described further below for 
   bulk mode re-registrations. 

   If the PBU message contains multiple MNIDs and/or HNP options, and 
   the LMA cannot find a matching binding cache entry, the LMA MUST 
   consider this to be equivalent to receiving multiple PBUs with one 
   MNID and/or HNP option each. 

   If the bulk re-registration flag in the PBU message is set to 1 and 
   if included mobility options identify a single MN, the LMA MAY add 
   the MN to the set of MNs re-registered in a bulk mode, subject to the 
   local policy. The decision whether to enable bulk re-registration 
   mode for a MN is a matter of local policy at the LMA and is outside 
   the scope of this specification.

Internet-Draft        PMIP6 bulk re-registration              July 2008 
    

   If the LMA decides to accept the bulk re-registration mode for the 
   MN, it SHALL add the MN to the bulk re-registration set. The LMA 
   SHALL maintain the bulk re-registration set per MAG. 

   Upon adding the MN to the bulk re-registration set, the LMA SHALL 
   respond with the PBAck message containing the bulk registration bit 
   to 1.  

   The PBU message with the bulk re-registration bit (B) set to 1 but 
   without the MN ID and HNP options is a valid message and indicates a 
   request for bulk mode re-registration of all MNs that are members of 
   the bulk re-registration set.  

   If the bulk re-registration flag (B) is set in the PBU message and 
   included mobility options do not identify an individual MN, the LMA 
   SHALL extend the binding lifetime of all affected MNs attached to the 
   MAG that sent the bulk PBU. The affected MNs are those MNs that are 
   members of a bulk re-registration set and whose binding cache entries 
   match the mobility options included in the bulk PBU message. The 
   valid mobility options and their semantics are described in section 
   3.  

   The LMA SHOULD set the binding lifetime of all MNs re-registered in a 
   bulk mode to expire at the same point in time. 

   The LMA SHOULD copy the mobility options from the bulk re-
   registration request into the PBAck message sent in response. 

   Upon successful processing of bulk mode re-registration request, the 
   LMA MUST respond with a PBAck message indicating success and it 
   SHOULD set the bulk re-registration bit (B) to 1. The lifetime in the 
   PBAck message indicates the time when binding cache entries of 
   affected MNs will expire. 

   The LMA MAY reject the request for bulk re-registration. In this case 
   the LMA MUST NOT update binding cache entries of any MNs and SHALL 
   respond with PBAck where the bulk re-registration bit is set to 1 and 
   the status code indicates the reason for rejection. 

   After successfully processing the bulk PBU message, the LMA MAY start 
   a single timer to oversee the binding lifetime of all MNs affected by 
   this bulk re-registration transaction. 

   When the LMA receives a PBU message requesting a (re-)registration of 
   a single MN from a MAG that successfully executed a bulk re-
   registration procedure before and the lifetime of that bulk re-

Internet-Draft        PMIP6 bulk re-registration              July 2008 
    

   registration is not expired yet, the LMA MAY set the lifetime in the 
   PBAck message to match the remaining lifetime of the MNs contained in 
   the bulk re-registration set. As a result the LMA is not required to 
   start a separate timer to oversee the binding lifetime of this MN. 

   The LMA not supporting this specification ignores the bulk re-
   registration bit (B) in a PBU message and processes the message as 
   per the baseline specification [Gun2008]. In this case the PBAck 
   message sent in response contains the bulk re-registration bit (B) is 
   set to 0. 

   If the LMA that does not support this specification receives a bulk 
   PBU message that does not contain any options identifying a 
   particular MN then the LMA responds with the PBAck message where the 
   status field contains one of the following error codes: 

      MISSING_HOME_NETWORK_PREFIX_OPTION 

      MISSING_MN_IDENTIFIER_OPTION 

   These error codes are defined in the baseline specification 
   [Gun2008]. 

    

7. Security Considerations 

   The bulk re-registration mechanism does not introduce any new 
   security threat or vulnerability to the PMIP6 specification. 

    

8. IANA Considerations 

   None.
