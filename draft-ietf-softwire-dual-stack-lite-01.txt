Abstract

   The common thinking for more than 10 years has been that the
   transition to IPv6 will be based on the dual stack model and that
   most things would be converted this way before we ran out of IPv4.

   It has not happened.  The IANA free pool of IPv4 addresses will be
   depleted soon, well before any significant IPv6 deployment will have
   occurred.

   This document revisits the dual-stack model and introduces the dual-
   stack lite technology aimed at better aligning the costs and benefits
   of deploying IPv6.  Dual-stack lite will provide the necessary bridge
   between the two protocols, offering an evolution path of the Internet
   post IANA IPv4 depletion.

   Dual-Stack lite enable a brodband service provider to share IPv4
   addresses among customers by combining two well-known technologies:
   IP in IP (IPv4/IPv6) and NAT.

Internet-Draft               Dual-stack lite                   July 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document presents views on IP deployments after the exhaustion
   of IPv4 addresses and some of the necessary technologies to achieve
   it.  The views expressed are the authors' personal opinions and in no
   way imply that Comcast plans to deploy or that Cisco will implement
   the technologies described here.

1.1.  Requirements language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   This document makes a distinction between a dual-stack capable and a
   dual-stack provisioned device.  The former is a device that has code
   that implements both IPv4 and IPv6, from the network layer to the
   applications.  The later is a similar device that has been
   provisioned with both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address on its
   interface(s).  This document will also further refine this notion by
   distinguishing between interfaces provisioned directly by the service
   provider from those provisioned by the customer.

1.3.  IPv4 exhaustion coming sooner than expected

   Global public IPv4 addresses coming from the IANA free pool are
   running out faster than many predicted a few years ago.  The current
   model shows that exhaustion could happen as early as 2010 or 2011.
   See http://ipv4.potaroo.net for more details.  Those projection are
   based on the assumption that tomorrow is going to be very similar to
   today, i.e., looking at recent address consumption figures is a good
   indicator of future consumption patterns.  This of course, does not
   take into account any new large scale deployment of IP technology or
   any human reaction when facing an upcoming shortage.

   The prediction of the exact date of exhaustion of the IANA free pool
   is outside the scope of this document, however one conclusion must be
   drawn from that study: there will be in the near future a point where
   new global public IPv4 addresses will not be available in large
   enough quantity thus any new broadband deployment may have to
   consider the option of not provisioning any (global) IPv4 addresses
   to the WAN facing interface of edge devices.  However, the classic
   IPv6 deployment model known as "dual stack provisioning" can be a non
   starter in such environments.

2.  The two long tails

   The dual-stack lite technology is intended for maintaining
   connectivity to legacy IPv4 devices and networks after the exhaustion
   of the IPv4 address space while service provider networks make a
   transition to IPv6-only deployments.  This section describes some of
   the specific legacy scenarios addressed by dual-stack lite.

2.1.  The long tail of IPv4-only devices in the home

   Broadband home customers have a mix and match of IP enabled devices.
   The most recent operating systems (e.g., Windows Vista, Mac OS X and
   various versions of Linux) can operate in an IPv6-only environment;
   however most of the legacy devices can't.  Windows XP, for example,
   cannot process DNS requests over IPv6 transport.  More, having an
   operating system that support IPv6 does npot garantee that all the
   application will support IPv6.  Many are still only supporting IPv4.

   Consumer electronic devices (non traditional PCs) are now more and
   more conected to home networks.  Large TVs with a MOCA or ethernet
   connection, point-and-shoot camera with a Wifi interface to push
   pictures on the Web, and many others are now comom and most have been
   reported to only support IPv4.  Those devices are generally not
   upgradables to support IPv6.  Expecting broadband customers to
   massively upgrade their software (and in most cases the corresponding
   hardware) to deploy IPv6 is a very tall order.

2.2.  The long tail of content and services available on the Internet

   IPv6 deployment has taken a very long time to take off, so the
   current situation is that almost none of the content and services
   available on the Internet are accessible over IPv6.  This situation
   will probably change in the future, but for now, one has to make the
   assumption that most of the traffic generated by (and to) broadband
   customers will be sent to (and originated by) IPv4 nodes.  Even when
   the majority of the most popular content will be accessible via IPv6,
   there will still be a need to access the long tail of content only
   reachable with IPv4.

2.3.  Additional impact on new broadband deployment

   Even when considering new, green field, broadband deployments, such
   as always-on 4G, service providers have to face the same situation as
   described above, that is, content and services available on the
   Internet are, today, generally accessible only over IPv4 and not
   IPv6.  This makes adoption of IPv6 for green field deployment
   difficult.  Solutions like NAT-PT, now deprecated, do not provide, as
   of today, a satisfying and scalable answer.

Internet-Draft               Dual-stack lite                   July 2009


2.4.  Burden on service providers

   As a conclusion, broadband service providers may be faced with the
   situation where they have IPv4 customers who need to communicate with
   IPv4 servers on the Internet but may not have any IPv4 addresses left
   to assign to those customers.  A service providers may also be in a
   situation where it wants to deploy IPv6 in its core network, avoiding
   the use of scarce IPv4 addresses.  However, without some form of
   backward compatibility with IPv4, the cost and the benefits of
   deploying IPv6 are not aligned, making incremental IPv6 deployment
   very difficult.

2.5.  Dual-prong strategy for broadband

   Facing the reality of the upcoming completion of the IPv4 address
   space on pne side and the two long IPv4 tails on the other side,
   broadband providers can implement a dual-prong strategy when they
   will face a shortage of IPv4 addresses.  First prong is to deploy
   IPv6 natively.  Second is to use a transition bridge to offer an IPv4
   service without relying on a unique IPv4 adress per customer.  That
   means haring IPv4 addresses among customers and implementing some
   form of NAT inside the provider network.  This documment proposes a
   scalable way of doing so by combining two well-known technologies, IP
   in IP (IPv4/IPv6) tunneling and NAT.


3.  Expectations for dual-stack lite deployment

3.1.  Expectations for home gateway based scenarios

   This section mainly address home style networks characterized by the
   presence of a home gateway.

   Legacy, unmodified, IPv4-only devices inside the home network are
   expected to keep using [RFC1918] address space, a-la 192.168.0.0/16
   and should be able to access the IPv4 Internet in a similar way they
   do it today through a home gateway IPv4 NAT.

   Unmodified IPv6 capable devices are expected to be able to reach
   directly the IPv6 Internet, without going through any translation.
   It is expected that most IPv6 capable devices will also be IPv4
   capable and will simply be configured with an IPv4 RFC1918 style
   address within the home network and access the IPv4 Internet the same
   way as the legacy IPv4-only devices within the home.

   IPv6-only devices that do not include code for an IPv4 stack are
   outside of the scope of this document.

Internet-Draft               Dual-stack lite                   July 2009


   It is expected that the home gateway is either software upgradable,
   replaceable or provided by the service provider as part of a new
   contract.  Outside of early IPv6 deployments done prior to IPv4
   exhaustion using some form of tunnel, this is pretty much a
   requirement to deploy any IPv6 service to the home.  It is expected
   that this home gateway will be a dual stack capable device that would
   only be provisioned with IPv6 on its WAN side.  IPv4 and IPv6 are
   expected to be locally provisioned on any LAN interfaces of such
   devices.  IPv4 addresses on such interfaces are expected to be
   RFC1918.  The key point here is that the service provider will not
   provision any IPv4 addresses for those home gateway devices.

3.2.  Expectations for devices directly connected to the broadband
      service provider network

   Under this deployment model, devices directly connected to the
   broadband service provider network without the presence of a home
   gateway will have to be dual stack capable devices.  The service
   provider facing interface(s) of such device will only be provisioned
   with IPv6.  IPv4 may or may not be provisioned locally on other
   interfaces of such devices.  Similarly to the above section, the key
   point here is that the service provider will not provision any IPv4
   addresses for those directly connected devices.

   It is expected that directly connected devices will implement code to
   support the dual-stack lite functionality.  The minimum support
   required is an IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel [RFC2473].

   IPv4-only devices and IPv6-only devices are specifically left out of
   scope for this document.  It is expected that most modern device
   directly connected to the service provider network would not have
   memory constraints to implement both stack.

3.3.  Expectations for IP-enabled wireless devices scenario

   Simialr to host devices directly connected to the broadband servie
   provider network, the wireless device will have dual-stack
   implemented.  When the wireless device requests IP connectivity from
   the service provider, the service provider will only provision an
   IPv6 address to the WAN facing interface of the wireless device.  No
   IPv4 (public or RFC1918) address will be given to the device.  When
   the wireless device accesses IPv4 services, it will be implemented
   the dual-stack lite functionality described in section 4.

3.4.  Application expectations

   Most applications that today work transparently through an IPv4 home
   gateway NAT should keep working the same way.  However, it is not

Internet-Draft               Dual-stack lite                   July 2009


   expected that applications that requires specific port assignment or
   specific port mapping from the NAT box will keep working.  Details
   and recommendations for application behavior are outside the scope of
   this document and should be discussed in the behave working group.

3.5.  Service provider network expectations

   The dual-stack lite deployment model is based on the notion that IPv4
   addresses will be shared by several customers.  This implies that the
   NAT functionality will move from the home gateway to a device hosted
   within the service provider network.  It is important to observe that
   this functionality does not have to be performed deep in the core of
   the network and that it might be better implemented close to the
   aggregation point of customer traffic.


4.  Dual-stack lite

   The core ideas behind dual-stack lite are:

   o  Move from a deployment model where a globally unique IPv4 address
      is provisioned per customer and shared among several devices
      within that customer premise to a deployment model where that
      globally unique IPv4 address is shared among many customers

   o  Provide transport of IPv4 traffic to customers over a core network
      that uses only IPv6

   Instead of relying on a cascade of NATs or NAT-PT, the dual-stack
   lite model is built on IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnels to cross the network to
   reach a carrier-grade IPv4-IPv4 NAT.  As such, it simplifies the
   management of the service provider network by using only IPv6 and
   provides the customer the benefit of having only one layer of NAT.
   The additional benefit of this model is to gradually introduce IPv6
   in the Internet by making it virtually backward compatible with IPv4.

   Details about IPv6 tunneling can be found on [RFC2473], where the
   next header is simply 4, for IPv4, as explained in [RFC2460] and in
   [RFC1700].

4.1.  Domain of application

   The dual-stack lite deployment model has been designed with broadband
   networks in mind.  It is certainly applicable to other domains
   although the authors do not make any specific claim of suitability.

Internet-Draft               Dual-stack lite                   July 2009


4.2.  Dual-stack lite interface

   A dual-stack lite interface on a dual-stack capable device is modeled
   as a point to point IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel.  Its configuration requires
   that the device is provisioned with IPv6 but does not require it to
   be provisioned with a global IPv4 by the service provider.

   Any locally unique IPv4 address can be configured on the subscriber
   network end of the dual-stack lite tunnel.  In the case of dual-stack
   lite in which the tunnel endpoint is in a host Section 5.2, it is
   recommended that dual-stack lite implementations use any address
   a.b.c.d in the well known range e.f.g.h/p (to be defined by IANA) but
   the first one (all-zero address in the reserved subnet) as the IPv4
   host side of the tunnel and the last one of the same range as the
   address of the IPv4 default gateway, with a netmask to cover a /p
   network.

   o  Note 1: on a multi-home node, several dual-stack like interfaces
      could end-up being configured.  Each of those interfaces should be
      configured with a different IPv4 address taken out of the reserved
      range.

   o  Note 2: because of this static configuration using well known
      values, there is no need to run a DHCPv4 client on a dual-stack
      lite interface.

   The service provider network end point of a dual-stack lite interface
   is the IPv6 address of a dual-stack lite carrier-grade NAT within the
   service provider network.

4.3.  Dual-stack lite device

   A dual-stack lite device is a dual-stack capable device implementing
   a dual-stack lite interface.  In the absence of better routing
   information, a dual-stack lite device will configure a static IPv4
   default route over the dual-stack lite interface.

4.4.  Dual-stack lite home router

   A dual-stack lite home router is a dual-stack capable home router
   implementing a dual-stack lite interface layered on top of its WAN
   interface.  In the absence of better routing information, a dual-
   stack lite home router will configure a static IPv4 default route
   over the dual-stack lite interface.  The dual-stack lite home router
   can use any IPv4 address a.b.c.d out of the e.f.g.h/p prefix (TBD by
   IANA) to source its own IPv4 packets, embedded into the IPv6 tunnel.
   If the dual-stack lite home router need to configure a router
   pointing to an IPv4 default router, it can use the last address in

   the e.f.g.h/p (TBD by IANA) range for that purpose, with a netmask to
   cover a /p (TBD by IANA) network.

   For normal IPv4 packets, a dual-stack lite home router MUST NOT
   perform any IPv4 address translation.  From egress traffic, the home
   router passes packets from the LAN interface to the dual-stack lite
   interface for IPv6 encapsulation.  For ingress traffic, the home
   router receives packets from the dual-stack lite interface,
   decapsulates the IPv6 header, and routes the packets to the target
   based on the destination address in the IPv4 header.  Either case,
   the dual-stack lite home router will not perform address translation.

   For IPv4 packets fallen into the A+P address space, the A+P enabled
   home router MUST perform the A+P mechanism described in
   [I-D.ymbk-aplusp].  For egress traffic, the home router references
   the A+P table using the source IPv4 address and transport port
   number, and passes the packets from the LAN interface to the dual-
   stack lite interface for IPv6 encapsulation.  For ingress traffic,
   the home router receives packets from the dual-stack lite interface,
   decapsulates the IPv6 header, finds the targeted host using the A+P
   table, and routes the packets accordingly to the host.  The A+P
   enabled home router handles the A+P table.  The dual-stack lite
   carrier-grade NAT simply forwards the packets to the IPv4-in-IPv6
   tunnel.

   Besides, the dual-stack lite router must account the tunnel overhead
   which reduces the effective MTU size.  As such, the router may
   perform IPv6 fragmentation.  More details can be found in
   Section 10.2.

4.5.  Dual-stack lite router

   The concept of a dual-stack lite home router can be extended to any
   IPv4 router serving as a gateway between a leaf IP domain and the
   rest of the Internet.

4.6.  Discovery of the dual-stack lite carrier-grade NAT device

   The IPv6 address of a dual-stack lite carrier-grade NAT device can be
   configured on a dual-stack lite interface using a variety of methods,
   ranging from an out-of-band mechanism, manual configuration, a to-be-
   defined DHCPv6 option [I-D.dhankins-softwire-tunnel-option] or a to-
   be-defined IPv6 router advertisement.  It is expected that over time
   some or all the above methods, as well as others, will be defined.
   The requirements and specifications of such methods are out of scope
   for this document.

4.7.  Dual-stack lite carrier-grade NAT

   A dual-stack lite carrier grade NAT is a special IPv4 to IPv4 NAT
   deployed within the service provider network.  It is reachable by
   customers via a series of point to point IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnels.

   A dual-stack lite carrier-grade NAT uses a combination of the IPv6
   source address of the tunnel and the inner IPv4 source address to
   establish and maintain the IPv4 NAT mapping table.

   A dual-stack lite carrier-grade NAT does not have to perform any
   IPv6-IPv6, IPv6-IPv4 or IPv4-IPv6 NAT.

   A dual-stack lite carrier-grade NAT can use the last IPv4 address of
   the range e.f.g.h/p (TBD by IANA) in the IPv4 ICMP packets it will
   originate toward a dual-stack lite client to enable meaningful ping
   and traceroute results.

   A dual-stack lite carrier-grade NAT forwards packets without NAT for
   those fallen in the A+P address space.


5.  Example architectures

   The underlying technology behind dual-stack lite is the combination
   of two well-known technologies: NAT and tunneling.  This combination
   can be best described using the terminology developed in the softwire
   working group as Softwire NAT, or SNAT.

   Two architectures can be deployed for dual-stack lite.  One is
   targeting the legacy installed base of IPv4 only hosts (and dual-
   stack capable hosts) sitting behind a gateway.  The second is
   targeting dual-stack capable hosts initiating the tunnel themselves.

5.1.  Router-based architecture

   This architecture is targeted at residential broadband deployments
   but can be adapted easily to other types of deployment where the
   installed base of IPv4-only device is important.

   Consider a scenario where a Dual-Stack lite home gateway is
   provisioned only with IPv6 in the WAN port, no IPv4.  The home
   gateway acts as an IPv4 DCHP server for the LAN network (wireline and
   wireless) handing out RFC1918 addresses.  In addition, the home
   gateway may support IPv6 Auto-Configuration and/or DHCPv6 server for
   the LAN network.  When an IPv4-only device connects to the home
   gateway, the gateway will hand it out a RFC1918 address.  When a
   dual-stack capable device connects to the home gateway, the gateway

Internet-Draft               Dual-stack lite                   July 2009


   will hand out a RFC1918 address and a global IPv6 address to the
   device.  Besides, the home gateway will create an IPv4-in-IPv6
   softwire tunnel [RFC5571]to a Carrier-Grade NAT.  The Carrier-Grade
   NAT will reside in the service provider network.

   When the device accesses IPv6 service, it will send the IPv6 datagram
   to the home gateway natively.  The home gateway will route the
   traffic upstream to the default gateway.

   When the device accesses IPv4 service, it will source the IPv4
   datagram with the RFC1918 address and send the IPv4 datagram to the
   home gateway.  The home gateway will encapsulate the IPv4 datagram
   inside the IPv4-over-IPv6 softwire tunnel and forward the IPv6
   datagram to the Carrier-Grade NAT.  This contrasts what the home
   gateways normally do today which will NAT the RFC1918 address to the
   public IPv4 address and route the datagram upstream.  When the
   Carrier-Grade NAT receives the IPv6 datagram, it will de-capsulate
   the IPv6 header and perform an IPv4-to-IPv4 NAT on the source
   address.

   As illustrated in Figure 1, this dual-stack lite deployment model
   consists of three components: the dual-stack lite home router, the
   dual-stack lite carrier-grade NAT and a softwire between the softwire
   initiator (SI) [RFC5571] in the dual-stack lite home router and the
   softwire concentrator (SC) [RFC5571] in the dual-stack lite carrier-
   grade NAT.  The dual-stack lite carrier-grade NAT performs IPv4-IPv4
   NAT translations to multiplex multiple subscribers through a single
   global IPv4 address.  Overlapping address spaces used by subscribers
   are disambiguated through the identification of tunnel endpoints.

   Notes:

   o  The dual-stack lite home router is not required to be on the same
      link as the host

   o  The dual-stack lite home router could be replaced by a dual-stack
      lite router in the service provider network

   The resulting solution accepts an IPv4 datagram that is translated
   into an IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire datagram for transmission across the
   softwire.  At the corresponding endpoint, the IPv4 datagram is
   decapsulated, and the translated IPv4 address is inserted based on a
   translation from the softwire.

5.1.1.  Example message flow

   In the example shown in Figure 2, the translation tables in the dual-
   stack lite carrier-grade NAT is configured to forward between IP/TCP
   (10.0.0.1/10000) and IP/TCP (129.0.0.1/5000).  That is, a datagram
   received by the dual-stack lite home router from the host at address
   10.0.0.1, using TCP DST port 10000 will be translated a datagram with
   IP SRC address 129.0.0.1 and TCP SRC port 5000 in the Internet.

                         Datagram header contents

   When datagram 1 is received by the dual-stack lite home router, the
   SI function encapsulates the datagram in datagram 2 and forwards it
   to the dual-stack lite carrier-grade NAT over the softwire.

   When it receives datagram 2, the SC in the dual-stack lite carrier-
   grade NAT hands the IPv4 datagram to the NAT, which determines from
   its translation table that the datagram received on Softwire_1 with
   TCP SRC port 10000 should be translated to datagram 3 with IP SRC
   address 129.0.0.1 and TCP SRC port 5000.

   Figure 3 shows an inbound message received at the dual-stack lite
   carrier-grade NAT.  When the NAT function in the dual-stack lite
   carrier-grade NAT receives datagram 1, it looks up the IP/TCP DST in
   its translation table.  In the example in Figure 3, the NAT
   translates the TCP DST port to 10000, sets the IP DST address to
   10.0.0.1 and hands the datagram to the SC for transmission over
   Softwire_1.  The SI in the dual-stack lite home router decapsulates
   IPv4 datagram from the inbound softwire datagram, and forwards it to
   the host.

5.1.2.  Translation details

   The dual-stack lite carrier-grade NAT has a NAT that translates
   between softwire/port pairs and IPv4-address/port pairs.  The same
   translation is applied to IPv4 datagrams received on the device's
   external interface and from the softwire endpoint in the device.

   In Figure 2, the translator network interface in the dual-stack lite
   carrier-grade NAT is on the Internet, and the softwire interface
   connects to the dual-stack lite home router.  The dual-stack lite
   carrier-grade NAT translator is configured as follows:

   Network interface:  Translate IPv4 destination address and TCP
      destination port to the softwire identifier and TCP destination
      port

   Softwire interface:  Translate softwire identifier and TCP source
      port to IPv4 source address and TCP source port

   Here is how the translation in Figure 3 works:

   o  Datagram 1 is received on the dual-stack lite carrier-grade NAT
      translator network interface.  The translator looks up the IPv4-
      address/port pair in its translator table, rewrites the IPv4
      destination address to 10.0.0.1 and the TCP source port to 10000,

      and hands the datagram to the SE to be forwarded over the
      softwire.

   o  The IPv4 datagram is received on the dual-stack lite home router
      SI.  The SI function extracts the IPv4 datagram and the dual-stack
      lite home router forwards datagram 3 to the host.

            Dual-Stack lite carrier-grade NAT translation table

   The Softwire-Id is the IPv6 address assigned to the Dual-Stack lite
   home gateway.  Hosts behind the same Dual-Stack lite home router have
   the same Softwire-Id.  The source IPv4 is the RFC1918 addressed
   assigned by the Dual-Stack home router which is unique to each host
   behind the home gateway.  The Dual-Stack lite carrier-grade NAT would
   receive packets sourced from different IPv4 addresses in the same
   softwire tunnel.  The carrier-grade NAT combines the Softwire-Id and
   IPv4 address/Port [Softwire-Id, IPv4+Port] to uniquely identify the
   host behind the same Dual-Stack lite home router.

5.2.  Host based architecture

   This architecture is targeted at new, large scale deployments of
   dual-stack capable devices implementing a dual-stack lite interface.

   Consider a scenario where a Dual-Stack lite host device is directly
   connected to the service provider network.  The host device is dual-
   stack capable but only provisioned an IPv6 global address.  Besides,
   the host device will pre-configure a well-known IPv4 non-routable
   address (see IANA section).  This well-known IPv4 non-routable
   address is similar to the 127.0.0.1 loopback address.  Every host
   device implemented Dual-Stack lite will pre-configure the same
   address.  This address will be used to source the IPv4 datagram when
   the device accesses IPv4 services.  Besides, the host device will
   create an IPv4-over-IPv6 softwire tunnel to a Carrier Grade NAT.  The
   Carrier Grade NAT will reside in the service provider network.

   When the device accesses IPv6 service, the device will send the IPv6
   datagram natively to the default gateway.

   When the device accesses IPv4 service, it will source the IPv4
   datagram with the well-known non-routable IPv4 address.  Then, the
   host device will encapsulate the IPv4 datagram inside the IPv4-over-

   IPv6 softwire tunnel and send the IPv6 datagram to the Carrier-Grade
   NAT.  When the Carrier-Grade NAT receives the IPv6 datagram, it will
   de-capsulate the IPv6 header and perform IPv4-to-IPv4 NAT on the
   source address.

   This scenario works on both wireline and wireless networks.  A
   typical wireless device will connect directly to the service provider
   without home gateway in between.

   As illustrated in Figure 4, this dual-stack lite deployment model
   consists of three components: the dual-stack lite host, the dual-
   stack lite carrier-grade NAT and a softwire between the softwire
   initiator (SI) in the host and the softwire concentrator (SC) in the
   dual-stack lite carrier-grade NAT.  The dual-stack lite host is
   assumed to have IPv6 service and can exchange IPv6 traffic with the
   dual-stack lite carrier-grade NAT.

   The dual-stack lite carrier-grade NAT performs IPv4-IPv4 NAT
   translations to multiplex multiple subscribers through a single
   global IPv4 address.  Overlapping IPv4 address spaces used by the
   dual-stack lite hosts are disambiguated through the identification of
   tunnel endpoints.

   In this situation, the dual-stack lite host configures the IPv4
   address a.b.c.d out of the well-known range e.f.g.h/p (TBD by IANA)
   on it dual-stack lite interface acting as the SI.  It also configure
   the last IPv4 address of the reserved range as the address of its
   default gateway, with a netmask to cover a /p (TBD by IANA) network.

   The resulting solution accepts an IPv4 datagram that is translated
   into an IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire datagram for transmission across the
   softwire.  At the corresponding endpoint, the IPv4 datagram is
   decapsulated, and the translated IPv4 address is inserted based on a

                         Datagram header contents

   When sending an IPv4 packet, the dual-stack lite host encapsulates it
   in datagram 1 and forwards it to the dual-stack lite carrier-grade
   NAT over the softwire.

   When it receives datagram 1, the SC in the dual-stack lite carrier-
   grade NAT hands the IPv4 datagram to the NAT, which determines from
   its translation table that the datagram received on Softwire_1 with
   TCP SRC port 10000 should be translated to datagram 3 with IP SRC
   address 129.0.0.1 and TCP SRC port 5000.

   Figure 6 shows an inbound message received at the dual-stack lite
   carrier-grade NAT.  When the NAT function in the dual-stack lite
   carrier-grade NAT receives datagram 1, it looks up the IP/TCP DST in
   its translation table.  In the example in Figure 3, the NAT
   translates the TCP DST port to 10000, sets the IP DST address to
   a.b.c.d and hands the datagram to the SC for transmission over
   Softwire_1.  The SI in the dual-stack lite home router decapsulates
   IPv4 datagram from the inbound softwire datagram, and forwards it to
   the host.

   address a.b.c.d out of the e.f.g.h/p (TBD by IANA) range used by all
   the hosts are disambiguated by the IPv6 source address of the
   softwire.

         +---------------------------------+--------------------+
         |           Softwire-Id/IPv4/Port | IPv4/Port          |
         +---------------------------------+--------------------+
         | 2001:0:0:1::1/a.b.c.d/TCP 10000 | 129.0.0.1/TCP 5000 |
         +---------------------------------+--------------------+

            Dual-Stack lite carrier-grade NAT translation table

   The Softwire-Id is the IPv6 address assigned to the Dual-Stack host.
   Each host has an unique Softwire-Id.  The source IPv4 address is one
   of the well-known IPv4 address (TBD by INAN).  The carrier-grade NAT
   could receive packets from different hosts sourced from the same IPv4
   well-known address from different softwire tunnels.  Similar to the
   SNAT gateway architecture, the Dual-Stack lite carrier grade NAT
   combines the Softwire-Id and IPv4 address/Port [Softwire-Id, IPv4+
   Port] to uniquely identify the individual host.


6.  Encapsulations

   In its simplest deployment model, dual-stack lite only requires IPv4
   in IPv6 encapsulation.  In more complex scenario where a site gateway



Durand                  Expires January 12, 2010               [Page 26]

Internet-Draft               Dual-stack lite                   July 2009


   would play the role of the softwire initiator, more complex
   encapsulation might be desired.  Thus dual-stack lite hosts, dual-
   stack lite home gateway and dual-stack lite NAT devices MUST at
   minimum implement IPv4 in IPv6 encapsulation.  On top of that, dual-
   stack lite NAT devices MAY also support other encapsulation, like
   L2TPv2/v3, GRE, MPLS,...  If they do, they SHOULD support L2TPv2 as
   defined in the IETF softwire hub & spoke framework.


7.  DNS considerations

   A dual-satck lite home gateway is only provision on the WAN interface
   with IPv6.  As such, all configuration information have to be passed
   by the broadband service provider over IPv6.  This means that the
   home gateway will typically use DHCPv6 [RFC3315] to learn the address
   of the DNS recursive server as in [RFC3646].  However, DHCPv6 only
   defines an option to pass an IPv6 address of a DNS resolver, not an
   IPv4 address.  IPv6 node inside the home network may very well use
   this IPv6 address to reach the DNS resolver, but IPv4 nodes can't.
   They need to be configured with an IPv4 address of a recursive DNS
   server.

   The recommended way to solve this issue is to configure the home
   gateway to act as a DNS proxy, advertizing itself internally with
   DHCPv4 as an IPv4 DNS resolver and forwarding the DNS request over
   IPv6 to the IPv6 DNS resolver address it has received over DHCPv6.
   If the home gateway is also acting as a DHCPv6 server for internal
   host and is implementing the DHCPv6 DNS option, it can either also
   act as a DNS proxy or simply pass through the IPv6 address of the
   service provider DNS recursive server.  While implementing a DNS
   proxy, the home gateway should follow recommendations in
   [I-D.ietf-dnsext-dnsproxy].


8.  Carrier-grade NAT considerations

   A dual-stack lite carrier-grade NAT SHOULD implement behavior
   conforming to the best current practice, currently documented in
   [RFC4787], [I-D.ietf-behave-tcp] and [I-D.ietf-behave-nat-icmp].
   Other requirements for carrier-grade NATs can be found in
   [I-D.nishitani-cgn].


9.  Port allocation

   Because IPv4 addresses will be shared among customers and potentially
   a large address space reduction factor may be applied, in average,
   only a limited number N of TCP or UDP port numbers will be available



Durand                  Expires January 12, 2010               [Page 27]

Internet-Draft               Dual-stack lite                   July 2009


   per customer.  This means that applications opening a very large
   number of TCP ports may have a harder time to work.  For example, it
   has been reported that a very well know web site was using AJAX
   techniques and was opening up to 69 TCP ports per web page.  If we
   make the hypothesis of an address space reduction of a factor 100
   (one IPv4 address per 100 customers), and 65k ports per IPv4
   addresses available, that makes a total of N=650 ports available
   simultaneously to be shared among the various devices behind the
   dual-stack lite tunnel end-point.

   There is an important operational difference if those N ports are
   pre-allocated in a cookie-cutter fashion versus allocated on demand
   by incoming connections.  This is a difference between an average of
   N ports and a maximum of N ports.  Several service providers have
   reported an average number of connections per customer in the single
   digit.  At the opposite end, thousands or tens of thousands of ports
   could be use in a peak by any single customer browsing a number of
   AJAX/Web 2.0 sites.  With that average number of connections per
   customers in mind, having an address space reduction of a factor 100
   or more is realistic.

   Application expecting incoming connections, such a peer-to-peer ones,
   have become popular.  Those applications use a very limited number of
   ports, usually a single one.  Making sure those applications keep
   working in a dual-stack lite environment is important.  Similarly,
   there is a growing list of applications that require some king of ALG
   to work through a NAT.  Service provider carrier-grade NATs should
   not to be in the way of the deployment of such applications.  As
   such, there is a legitimate need to leave certain ports under the
   control of the end user.  This argue for an hybrid environment, where
   most ports are dynamically managed by the carrier-grade NAT in a
   shared pool and a limited number are dedicated per users and
   controlled by them.

   More considerations on sharing IPv4 addresses can be found in
   [I-D.ford-shared-addressing-issues].

9.1.  Static port reservation

   A service provider can reserve a static number of ports per user.
   Note: those could be TCP and/or UDP ports.  The simplest way to allow
   users to control the associated NAT bindings is to offer a web
   interface (for example as part of the service provider portal) where,
   once authenticated, a user can configure each dedicated external IPv4
   address/port binding on the carrier-grade NAT in one of the following
   way:





Durand                  Expires January 12, 2010               [Page 28]

Internet-Draft               Dual-stack lite                   July 2009


   o  either direct the carrier-grade NAT to forward incoming traffic on
      this address/port to the dual-stack lite home gateway, and let
      this device deal with it.  This required support for A+P
      [I-D.ymbk-aplusp] semantic on the home gateway.

   o  or direct the carrier-grade NAT to rewrite the destination address
      in those incoming packets to a private IPv4 address within the
      home network.  For obvious security reasons, redirection to global
      IPv4 address should not be authorized.  Note: this behavior is
      very similar to the port forwarding function found in most home
      gateways.

   The exact number of ports reserved per user is left at the discretion
   of the service provider.

9.2.  Dynamic port reservation

9.2.1.  UPnP

   One could be tempted to have the home gateway relaying UPnP messages
   over the tunnel to the carrier-grade NAT.  Unfortunately, this would
   not work.  Some applications insist on running on a well-known port
   number (or port range) using UPnP to request the NAT to reserve that
   port.  Those ports may or may not be available; they could be used by
   another customer.  Using UPnP, a NAT box does not have any way to
   redirect such applications to use another port, the only option is to
   deny the request.  Those applications typically then cycle through a
   small range of ports (typically 10 or so) until they abort.  The
   likelihood of those ports being all already in use by other users is
   very high.  As such, UPnP cannot be supported as-is in a dual-stack
   lite environment.

   oNote: the UPnP forum has been reported to address this issue in an
   upcoming version of the IGD profile.

9.2.2.  NAT-PMP

   NAT-PMP [I-D.cheshire-nat-pmp] offers a better semantic, by enabling
   the NAT to redirect the application to use another unallocated port.
   A Dual-stack lite home gateway could proxy the NAT-PMP messages to
   the carrier-grade NAT through the tunnel.

9.2.3.  DHCPv6

   If more ports need to be reserved outside of that static dedicated
   range, a DHCPv6 option such as
   [I-D.bajko-v6ops-port-restricted-ipaddr-assign] may also be an
   interesting approach.  This may be limited to the A+P semantic



Durand                  Expires January 12, 2010               [Page 29]

   mentioned above, as there might not be a way to explicitly control
   the port forwarding semantic.  Also, there are concerns that this
   would lead to a cooky cutter distribution of ports per customers,
   dramatically reducing the ratio of customer per IPv4 address.


10.  Other carrier-grade NAT considerations

10.1.  ALG

   The carrier-grade NAT should only perform a minimum number of ALG for
   the classic applications such as FTP, RTSP/RTP, IPsec and PPTP VPN
   pass-through and enable the users to use their own ALG on statically
   or dynamically reserved port instead.

   In particular, the carrier-grade NAT SHOULD NOT perform any ALG on
   the ports reserved either statically or dynamically for a user.

10.2.  MTU

   Using an encapsulation (IP-in-IP or L2TP) to carry IPv4 traffic over
   IPv6 will reduce the effective MTU of the datagram.  Unfortunately,
   path MTU discovery [RFC1191] is not a reliable method to deal with
   this problem.  For IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire [RFC2473], we suggest to
   increase the MTU size to the link-MTU + 40 bytes to all the links
   between the Dual-Stack lite Tunnel Entry-Point and Tunnel Exit-Point
   [RFC2473].  The extra 40 bytes can accommodate both the IPv6
   encapsulation header and the IPv4 datagram without fragmenting the
   IPv6 packet.  If the link MTU cannot be increased, the Tunnel Entry-
   Point and Tunnel Exit-Point MUST fragment and reassemble the over-
   sized datagram after IPv6 encapsulation.  When the Tunnel Entry-Point
   forwards a packet larger than the MTU after encapsulation, it MUST
   fragment the over-sized IPv6 packet into two IPv6 packets.
   Fragmentation happens because the resulted IPv6 packet after
   encapsulation is larger than MTU.  Thus, fragmentation MUST happen
   after the encapsulation on the IPv6 packet.  When the Tunnel Exit-
   Point receives the fragmented IPv6 packets, it MUST reassemble and
   decapsulate the packets.  Detailed procedure has been specified in
   [RFC2473] Section 7.2.

   There is a performance trade-off for this approach.  Fragmentation at
   the Tunnel Entry-Point is a light-weighted operation.  In contrast,
   reassembly at the Tunnel Exit-Point can be expensive.  When the
   Tunnel Exit-Point receives the first fragmented packet, it must wait
   for the second fragmented packet to arrive in order to reassemble the
   two fragmented IPv6 packets for decapsulation.  This requires the
   Tunnel Exit-Point to buffer and keep track of fragmented packets.
   Consider that the carrier-grade NAT is the Tunnel Exit-Point for many

   tunnels.  If many clients simultaneously source large number of
   fragmented packets to the carrier-grade NAT, this will demand the
   carrier-grade NAT to buffer and consume enormous resources to keep
   track of the flows.  This reassembly process will significantly
   impact the carrier-grade NAT performance.  However, this impact only
   happens when many clients simultaneously source large IPv4 packets.
   Since we believe that majority of the clients will receive large IPv4
   packets (such as watching video streams) instead of sourcing large
   IPv4 packets (such as sourcing video streams), so reassembly is only
   a fraction of the overall carrier-grade NAT's workload.

   Fragmentation/Reassembly could be expensive.  We suggest a method to
   optimize TCP sessions to reduce the need to fragment and reassemble
   TCP packets.  When the carrier-grade NAT receive the first TCP SYN
   packet which is used to initiate a TCP session, the carrier-grade NAT
   rewrites the MSS option in the TCP header to a lower value.  When the
   carrier-grade NAT receives the returned TCP SYN-ACK for that session,
   it will also rewrite the MSS option to a lower value.  In the case of
   using simple IPv4-in-IPv6, the suggested maximum MSS value is MTU
   substracts (IPv6 header + TCP header + IPv4 header).  For example: If
   the MTU is 1500, the MSS value would be re-written to 1500 - 40 - 20
   - 20 = 1420.  This optimization tries to assure that the TCP client
   and server generate packets smaller than the MTU size after
   encapsulation.  Hence, fragmentation and reassembly can be avoided
   throughout the life-time of this TCP session.

   TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO) [I-D.ietf-tcpm-tcp-auth-opt] is
   specified to protect against replays for TCP sessions.  In TCP-AO,
   when the TCP option flag sets to 0, all TCP options are included in
   the MAC calculation.  Modifying MSS option by carrier-grade NAT will
   alter the Message Authentication Codes (MAC) calculation.  Thus, the
   TCP-AO originator will consider this is a Man-in-the-Middle attack
   and fails the TCP-AO check.  When the TCP option flag sets to 1,
   TCP-AO will exclude all TCP options in the MAC calculation.
   Modifying MSS option will not alter the MAC calculation.  Thus,
   TCP-AO originator will pass the TCP-AO check.  The default TCP-AO
   behavior is to set TCP option flag to 0, so using TCP-AO in default
   mode with this optimization will cause TCP-AO check to fail.  For
   those consider to use MSS optimization, we recommend to set the TCP
   option flag to 1 when using TCP-AO.  TCP-AO is specified to replace
   TCP MD5 Signature Option (TCP-MD5) [RFC2385].  TCP-MD5 will continue
   to work because TCP-MD5 applies the MD5 algorithm on the TCP header,
   excluding options, and assuming a checksum of zero.

   this document or be the object of a separate document.

11.1.  Multicast considerations

   This document only describes unicast IPv4 as IPv4 Multicast is not
   widely deployed in broadband networks.  Some multicast IPv4
   considerations might to be discussed as well in a future revision of
   this document.

11.2.  3rd party carrier-grade NAT

   The dual-stack lite architecture can be easily extended to support
   3rd party carrier-grade NATs.  The dual-stack lite interface just
   need to be pointed to the IPv6 address of that 3rd party carrier-
   grade NAT instead of the IPv6 address of the service provider
   carrier-grade NAT.  Implementation of dual-stack lite should enable
   users to override the mechanism used for automatic discovery of the
   carrier grade NAT and, for example, manually enter the DNS name of
   the selected carrier-grade NAT.

11.3.  Interface initialization

   The initialization sequence of each interface of a dual-stack lite
   node need to be analyzed and heuristics need to be defined to
   determined if each interface operates in IPv4 mode, IPv6 mode, dual-
   stack mode or dual-stack lite mode.  The absence/presence of the
   DHCPv6 option discussed above in requests/responses could be a
   trigger to decide in which mode to operate.


12.  Comparison with an architecture with multiple-layers of NAT

   An alternative architecture could consist on layering multiple levels
   of IPv4-IPv4 NAT toward the edges of the service provider network.
   Such architecture has a key advantage: it would work with any
   existing IPv4 home gateway.  However, it would have a number of
   drawbacks:

   o  Each NAT device in the path will have its own application level
      gateways, increasing the odds of failure or miss-configuration.

   o  The larger private IPv4 address space available today is Net
      10.0.0.0/8.  It can in theory accommodate for about 16 million
      addresses, in practice, with an 80% allocation efficiency, it can
      address about 13 million devices.  This may not be enough for
      existing and future large scale deployments, thus multiple
      overlapping copies of Net 10 might have to be used simultaneously.
      This in itself create more complexity:



Durand                  Expires January 12, 2010               [Page 32]

Internet-Draft               Dual-stack lite                   July 2009


      *  If multiple copies of Net 10 are in use, network
         troubleshooting gets more difficult.  One first need to figure
         out in which Net 10 realm the customer is before sending a ping
         to a home gateway to test it.  This means that provisioning
         systems need to be modified to include this information.

      *  Multiple overlapping copies of Net 10 often intersect in some
         places with routers and firewalls.  The configuration of such
         devices need to carefully take into accounts the overlapping
         address space.  Debugging problems created by miss-
         configuration can be time consuming.

   o  Both legacy customers with global IPv4 addresses and new customers
      with private IPv4 addresses may be connected to the same
      aggregation router.  That router will have to make the decision to
      send packets directly to the Internet or via a translator based on
      the source address of those packets, which is known as source-
      based routing.  Although not impossible to implement, this adds
      complexity to the management of the network.

   None of the issues described above are show stoppers, but put
   together, they seriously increase the complexity of the management of
   the network.


13.  Comparison with NAT-PT (or its potential replacements)

   NAT-PT [RFC2766] deals with the translation from IPv6 to IPv4 and
   vice versa.  As such, it would not help solving the problem of
   offering IPv4 service to legacy IPv4 hosts.  NAT-PT is targeted at
   green field IPv6 deployments, allowing them to access services and
   content on the IPv4 Internet.  In that sense, NAT-PT could be in
   competition with dual-stack lite for green field deployment of new
   devices directly connected to the broadband service provider network.

   In this situation, NAT-PT has the advantage of enabling to remove
   entirely the IPv4 stack on edge devices.  This may be critical on
   sensor type devices with a very small memory footprint.  However, it
   is unclear if such devices really need to have access to the whole
   global IPv4 Internet in the first place or if they only need to
   communicate with servers that can be made IPv6 enable.

   In the more general case, dual-stack lite has several advantages over
   NAT-PT:

   o  Dual-stack lite does not require any hack to the DNS.  In other
      words, there is no need to synthesize fake AAAA records to
      represent IPv4 addresses.  This make DNSsec works more reliably.



Durand                  Expires January 12, 2010               [Page 33]

Internet-Draft               Dual-stack lite                   July 2009


   o  Because of the DNS ALG hack, NAT-PT places restriction on the
      topology, in most cases requiring that all exiting traffic go
      through a single point of contention.  Because there is no DNS ALG
      with dual-stack lite and because each dual-stack lite device can
      be directed independently to a different dual-stack lite NAT, the
      dual-stack lite architecture can scale better.

   o  ALG sometimes need to manipulate literal IP address in the payload
      of packets.  In the case of an IPv4-IPv4 NAT, this is a simple 32
      bit field replacement.  In the case of IPv6-IPv4 (or IPv4-IPv6)
      NAT, a 128 bit field need to be substituted by a 32 bit field (or
      vice versa).  This makes NAT-PT ALG more complex than dual-stack
      lite NAT ALG.

   For more detail on NAT-PT related issues, see [RFC4966].


14.  Comparison with DSTM

   DSTM [I-D.bound-dstm-exp] was addressing IPv6 backward compatibility
   with IPv4 by providing a temporary IPv4 address to dual-stack nodes.
   Connectivity was also provided by the way of IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnels.
   However, DSTM was relying on nodes acquiring and releasing IPv4
   addresses on a need to have basis.  It is the authors' opinion that
   such mechanism may not provide the necessary savings in address space
   for large scale broadband deployments.

16.  IANA Considerations

   This draft request IANA to allocate a well know IPv4 e.f.g.h/29
   network prefix.  That range is used to number the dual-stack lite
   interfaces.  Reserving a /29 allows for 6 possible interfaces on a

   multi-home node.  The last IPv4 address of this range is reserved as
   the IPv4 address of the default router for such dual-stack lite
   hosts.


17.  Security Considerations

   Security issues associated with NAT have long been documented.  See
   [RFC2663] and [RFC2993].

   However, moving the NAT functionality from the home gateway to the
   core of the service provider network and sharing IPv4 addresses among
   customers create additional requirements when logging data for abuse
   usage.  With any architecture where an IPv4 address does not uniquely
   represent an end host, IPv4 addresses and a timestamps are no longer
   sufficient to identify a particular broadband customer.  Additional
   information such as transport protocol information will be required
   for that purpose.  For example, we suggest to log the transport port
   number for TCP and UDP connections.

   The carrier-grade NAT performs translation functions for interior
   IPv4 hosts at RFC 1918 addresses or at the IANA reserved address
   range (TBA by IANA).  If the interior host is properly using the
   authorized IPv4 address with the authorized transport protocol port
   range such as A+P semantic for the tunnel, the carrier-grade NAT can
   simply forward without translation to permit the authorized address
   and port range to function properly.  All packets with unauthorized
   interior IPv4 addresses or with authorized interior IPv4 address but
   unauthorized port range MUST NOT be forwarded by the carrier-grade
   NAT.  This prevents rogue devices from launching denial of service
   attacks using unauthorized public IPv4 addresses in the IPv4 source
   header field or unauthorized transport port range in the IPv4
   transport header field.  For example, rogue devices could bombard a
   public web server by launching TCP SYN ACK attack.  The victim will
   receive TCP SYN from random IPv4 source addresses at a rapid rate and
   deny TCP services to legitimate users.

   Similarly, some attack mitigation techniques put an IPv4 address in a
   "penalty box" for a period of time if an abnormal behavior is
   observed.  Such techniques may need to be revisited as they would
   impact more than just one user (presumably the offender) at a time.

   With IPv4 addresses shared by multiple users, ports become a critical
   resource.  As such, some mechanisms need to be put in place by a
   carrier-grade NAT to limit port usage, either by rate-limiting new
   connections or putting a hard limit on the maximum number of port
   usable by single user.  If this number is high enough, it should not
   interfere with normal usage and still provide reasonable protection

   of the shared pool.

   More considerations on sharing IPv4 addresses can be found in
   "I-D.ford-shared-addressing-issues".

   If some form of IPv6 ingress filtering is deployed in the broadband
   network and dual-stack lite service is restricted to those customers,
   then tunnels terminating at the carrier-grade NAT and coming from
   registered customer IPv6 addresses cannot be spoofed.  Thus a simple
   access control list on the tunnel transport source address is all
   what is required to accept traffic on the southbound interface of a
   carrier-grade NAT.
