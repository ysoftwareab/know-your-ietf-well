Internet Draft                    SIP                       May 26, 2003


1 Introduction

   The AAA working group is chartered to work on authentication,
   authorization and accounting solutions for the Internet. This work
   consists of a base protocol, applications, end-to-end security
   application and a general architecture for providing these services
   [3]. The AAA working group has specified applicability of AAA-based
   solutions for a number of protocols (e.g., AAA requirements for
   Mobile IP [4]).

   SIP is a signalling protocol for creating, modifying and terminating
   different types sessions such as Internet phone calls, multimedia
   distribution and multimedia conferences [1]. SIP sessions have needs
   for session authentication, authorization and accounting. In order to
   perform AAA, SIP entities need to access AAA information (e.g., check
   if the password provided by a user is correct or store accounting
   records related to a particular session). Rather than collocating a
   database with AAA information with every SIP entity in a network, it
   is desirable to have a common logical AAA server accessible by all
   the SIP entities. SIP entities use a SIP-AAA interface to access this
   AAA server. This document outlines some requirements on this SIP-AAA
   interface between SIP entities and AAA servers. This document is
   intended as a generic document for SIP AAA requirements. It does not
   intend to develop a charging and/or billing mechanism for SIP.

   One possible use of this document would be to create a basic AAA
   application for SIP needs. The protocol used in the SIP-AAA interface
   could be any protocol that meets the requirements outlined by this
   document. Possible candidates, among others, are Diameter and XML-
   based protocols following the web-services model.

1.1 Terminology and Acronyms

        AAA: Authentication, Authorization and Accounting

        Accounting: The collection of resource consumption data for the
             purposes of capacity and trend analysis, cost allocation,
             auditing, and billing. Accounting management requires that
             resource consumption be measured, rated, assigned, and
             communicated between appropriate parties [5].

        Accounting with credit control: The application checks the end
             user's account for coverage for the requested service event
             charge prior to execution of that service event.

        Home AAA Server: Server where user with which the user maintains
             an account relationship.

        SIP: Session Initiation Protocol

        SIP proxies: SIP proxies are nodes which forward SIP requests
             and responses as well as make policy decisions.

        UAC: User Agent Client

        UAS: User Agent Server

1.2 Requirements Language

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2].

2 Requirements

   In this section, we list the requirements. Protocol solutions are not
   required to fulfill requirements for services that they do not
   support. For example, a solution that provides authentication
   services but not accounting services does not need to fulfill the
   accounting requirements. It is expected that solutions do fulfill the
   general requirements plus the requirements for the specific services
   they are providing.

   Section 2.1 lists general requirements, Section 2.2 lists
   requirements related to authentication, Section 2.3 lists
   requirements related to authorization and Section 2.4 lists
   requirements related to accounting.

2.1 Common Requirements

   This section outlines general requirements on the SIP-AAA interface.

2.1.1 Communication within the Same Domain

   The SIP-AAA interface MUST support communications between a SIP
   entity and a AAA server that belong to the same domain.

2.1.2 Communication between Different Domains

   The SIP-AAA interface MUST support communications between a SIP
   entity in one domain and a AAA server in another domain.

2.1.3 Discovery

   With the information contained in the SIP messages, the SIP-AAA
   interface MUST be able to deduce the particular AAA server that has



J. Loughney et. al.                                           [Page 5]


Internet Draft                    SIP                       May 26, 2003


   to be queried.

2.1.4 Ability to Integrate Different Networks, Services and Users

   The basic AAA architecture MUST be access independent. Service
   providers have to be able to provide AAA services for SIP,
   irrespective of access method or technology.

2.1.5 Updating SIP Server Entries

   When required, the SIP-AAA interface MUST allow the AAA server to
   update the information that a SIP entity has about a user.

2.1.6 SIP Session Changes

   The SIP-AAA interface MUST allow a SIP entity to inform the AAA
   server about changes in the SIP session that may affect the
   authorization, authentication or accounting for that SIP session.

2.1.7 Reliable Transfer of Protocol Messages

   The SIP-AAA interface MUST provide a reliable transfer of AAA
   protocol messages between the SIP entity and the AAA server.

2.1.8 Call Setup Times

   AAA SHOULD not unduly burden call setup times where appropriate. It
   may be reasonable to support some delay during registration, but
   delay during on-going sessions (especially real-time) are
   problematic.

2.1.9 Security

   AAA data MUST be able to be securely transported. The endpoints MUST
   be authenticated before data is sent. The endpoints MAY be authorized
   to access certain types of AAA data.

2.2 Authentication Requirements

   This section outlines requirements on the SIP-AAA interface related
   to authentication.

2.2.1 Authentication Based on SIP Requests

   The home AAA server MUST be able to authenticate a user based on any
   SIP request, except CANCELs and ACKs for non-2xx final responses.

        CANCELs and ACKs for non-2xx final response are hop-by-hop



J. Loughney et. al.                                           [Page 6]


Internet Draft                    SIP                       May 26, 2003


        requests that can be generated by proxies that do not have
        the user's credentials.

2.2.2 Flexible Authentication of SIP Requests

   The SIP-AAA interface MUST be flexible enough to accommodate a
   variety of authentication mechanisms used to authenticate SIP
   requests. In particular, the SIP-AAA interface MUST be able to
   accommodate all the authentication mechanisms mandated by the SIP
   specs.

2.2.3 Authentication between SIP Entities and AAA Servers

   The scheme supported for the authentication between the SIP servers
   and the AAA infrastructure MUST be flexible enough to accommodate a
   variety of authentication mechanisms.

2.3 Authorization Requirements

   This section outlines requirements on the SIP-AAA interface related
   to authorization.

2.3.1 Ability to Authorize SIP Requests

   The SIP-AAA interface MUST allow AAA servers to authorize any SIP
   request, except CANCELs and ACKs for non-2xx final responses.

        CANCELs and ACKs for non-2xx final responses are hop-by-hop
        requests that can be generated by proxies. SIP servers
        receiving a CANCEL or a ACK for a non-2xx final response do
        not challenge them, as they would do with an end-to-end
        request. Instead, they check at the transport or network
        layer that the entity sending the CANCEL or the ACK is the
        same as the one that generated the request being canceled
        or acked.

2.3.2 Information Transfer

   The SIP-AAA interface MUST allow transfering a wide range or set of
   information to be used to make an authorization decision. In
   particular, the SIP-AAA interface MUST allow a AAA server that is
   making an authorization decision to deliver the user profile to the
   SIP entity. Such a user profile may provide further information about
   the authorization decision to the SIP entity.

   For instance, a SIP proxy receives an INVITE from user A addressed to
   user B. The SIP proxy queries a AAA server and gets the following
   answer: user A is authorized to call user B as long as the requests



J. Loughney et. al.                                           [Page 7]


Internet Draft                    SIP                       May 26, 2003


   are routed through a particular SIP proxy server C. In this case, the
   SIP proxy needs to use SIP loose routing techniques to forward the
   INVITE so that it traverses SIP proxy C before reaching user B.

2.3.3 User De-authorization

   The SIP-AAA interface MUST allow the AAA server to inform a SIP
   entity when a particular user is no longer authorized to perform a
   particular task, even if it is an ongoing task.

2.3.4 User Re-authorization

   The SIP-AAA interface MUST allow the AAA server to inform a SIP
   entity that a particular authorization has been refreshed, and
   therefore, the user is still authorized to perform a particular task.

2.4 Accounting Requirements

   This section outlines requirements on the SIP-AAA interface related
   to accounting. Accounting is more than simple charging. Accounting
   may be a simple list of services accessed, servers accessed, duration
   of session, etc. Charging for SIP sessions can be extremely complex
   and requires some additional study. It is not the intent of this
   section to focus on charging.

        The information available to be accounted is different at
        SIP proxies and at SIP UAs. When end-to-end encryption is
        used, proxies do not have access to some parts of the SIP
        messages while UAs have access to the whole messages. In
        addition to this, UAs typically have information about the
        session itself (e.g., number of audio packets exchanged
        during an audio session). Therefore, even if the SIP-AAA
        interface provides a means to transfer a wide range of
        data, some SIP nodes may not have access to it. In order to
        design a network, it is important to analyze which SIP
        nodes will be able to generate the desired account records.

2.4.1 Separation of Accounting Information

   AAA accounting messages MUST be able to provide granular information
   based on different parameters.

   For example, it should be possible to separate "session duration"
   information from other information generated via additional services
   (e.g., 3-way calling). Separating accounting information makes it
   possible to provide accounting information to different parties based
   upon different aspects of the session.




J. Loughney et. al.                                           [Page 8]


Internet Draft                    SIP                       May 26, 2003


2.4.2 Accounting Information Related to Session Progression

   There MUST be support in the SIP-AAA interface for accounting
   transfers where the information contained in the accounting data has
   a direct bearing on the establishment, progression and termination of
   a session (e.g., reception of a BYE request).

2.4.3 Accounting Information Not Related to Session Progression

   There MUST be support in the SIP-AAA interface for accounting
   transfers where the information contained in the accounting data does
   NOT have a direct bearing on the establishment, progression and
   termination of a session (e.g., an instant MESSAGE that is not
   related to any session).

2.4.4 Support for One-Time and Session-based Accounting Records

   The SIP-AAA interface MUST allow SIP servers to provide relevant
   accounting information for billing and inter-network settlement
   purpose to the AAA servers. Both one-time event accounting records
   and session based (START, INTERIM, STOP records) accounting MUST be
   supported.

2.4.5 Support for Accounting on Different Media Components

   The SIP-AAA interface MUST support accounting per media component
   (e.g., voice and video). The SIP-AAA interface MUST enable different
   parties to be charged per media component.

2.4.6 Configuration of Accounting Generation Parameters

   The SIP-AAA interface MUST allow AAA servers to communicate
   parameters for accounting generation.

2.4.7 Support for Arbitrary Correlation IDs

   Some networks need to be able to relate the accounting to some aspect
   of the session. Therefore, the SIP-AAA interface MUST support
   arbitrary correlation IDs.

2.4.8 Support of Accounting with Credit Control

   The SIP-AAA interface MUST support accounting with credit control.
   The accounting application has to be able to check the end user's
   account for coverage for the requested service event charge prior to
   execution of that service event.

   Accounting with credit control is useful to implement prepaid



J. Loughney et. al.                                           [Page 9]


Internet Draft                    SIP                       May 26, 2003


   services where all chargeable events related to a specific account
   are prevented from the end user when the credit of that account is
   exhausted or expired.

2.4.9 Flexible Interface

   The scheme supported for the accounting between the SIP servers and
   the AAA infrastructure MUST be flexible enough to accommodate a
   variety of accounting mechanisms.

3 Scenarios

   This section outlines some possible scenarios for SIP and AAA
   interaction. These are purely illustrative examples, and do not
   impose any requirements.

   Figure 1 shows the typical call flow between a SIP proxy that
   communicates to a AAA server that performs authentication and
   authorization. All the examples are based on this flow.



          SIP            SIP            AAA
          UAC           Proxy          Server

           |              |              |
           |---METHOD---->|              |
           |              |--Is it OK?-->|
           |              |              |
           |              |<-----OK------|
           |              |              |
           |              |              |




   Figure 1: Call flow over the SIP-AAA interface



   The SIP proxy receives a request with certain credentials. The SIP
   UAC that generated the request may have included the credentials
   after having been challenged by the proxy using a 407 (Proxy
   Authentication Required) response. The SIP proxy sends a request to
   the AAA server asking if it is OK to provide a particular service for
   this request. The service may be simply routing forward the request
   or may consist of a more complex service. The AAA server checks that
   the credentials are correct (authentication), and checks the user



J. Loughney et. al.                                          [Page 10]


Internet Draft                    SIP                       May 26, 2003


   profile. The user profile indicates that it is OK to provide the
   service, and responds to the SIP proxy. The SIP proxy provides the
   service requested by the SIP UAC.

3.1 WLAN Roaming Using Third Party Service Providers

   User A wants to establish a voice session over the Internet with user
   B. User A wants its SIP signalling to be routed through SIP proxy C,
   because it provides a call log service (i.e., SIP proxy C sends an
   email to user A once a month with the duration of all the calls made
   during the month.)



                          SIP               AAA
        User A          Proxy C            Server           User B

          |                |                 |                |
          |<-----407-------|                 |                |
          |                |                 |                |
          |------ACK------>|                 |                |
          |                |                 |                |
          |----INVITE----->|                 |                |
          |                |---Is this OK?-->|                |
          |                |                 |                |

   Figure 2: WLAN roaming user



   User A accesses the Internet using a WLAN access outside his home
   domain. User A, user B, SIP proxy C and the home AAA server of user A
   are all in different domains.

   SIP proxy C challenges the initial INVITE from user A with a 407
   (Proxy Authentication Required) response, and user A reissues the

   that SIP proxy C can go ahead and provide its service for that call.
   SIP proxy C routes the INVITE forward towards user B and sends an
   accounting message to the AAA server, which will be used later to
   charge user A for the service provided by SIP proxy C.

3.2 Conditional Authorization

   User A is not in his home domain, but he still uses SIP proxy C
   (which is in user's A home domain) as the outbound proxy for an
   INVITE. SIP proxy C consults the home AAA server, which indicates
   that requests from user A have to be routed through SIP proxy D. SIP
   proxy C uses SIP loose routing so that the INVITE traverses D before
   reaching its destination. SIP proxy D will provide call log service
   for user A.
