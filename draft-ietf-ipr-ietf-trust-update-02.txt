Abstract
   This document updates RFC 3978 "IETF Rights in Contributions" to
   recognize that the IETF Trust is now the proper custodian of all
   IETF-related intellectual property rights.

   This document does not constrain how the IETF Trust exercises those
   rights.

1. Introduction

Internet-Draft       RFC 3978 Update for IETF Trust          August 2006


1.1  IETF Trust

   Currently the IETF requires that authors of Contributions to the IETF
   grant to the IETF (meaning the full set of participants in the IETF
   Standards Process) a limited set of non-exclusive rights and
   permissions as part of the process of submitting such Contribution.
   These rights and permissions are detailed in "IETF Rights in
   Contributions" (RFC 3978 - BCP 78) [RFC3978].

   The IETF Trust was recently formed to act as the administrative
   custodian of all copyrights and other intellectual property rights
   relating to the IETF Standards Process that had previously been held
   by ISOC and CNRI (See [IETF Trust Agreement]).

   The IETF is supported by an IETF Administrative Support Activity
   (IASA) defined in BCP 101 [BCP101].  BCP 101 was updated by [RFC4371]
   to recognize the creation of the IETF Trust.

   This document updates RFC 3978 in order to recognize the IETF Trust
   and to implement the structure needed to support it.  Most
   importantly, it alters the license-grant path as follows:  whereas
   previously authors of Contributions to the IETF would grant a license
   both to ISOC and to all IETF participants, such authors will grant a
   license to the IETF Trust (in Section 3.3).  This document concerns
   itself only with changes to RFC 3978 needed to recognize the creation
   of the IETF Trust.

   This introductory section is to provide context for the reader.
   Section 2 of this document is intended to be normative.
