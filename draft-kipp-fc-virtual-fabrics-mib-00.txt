 Abstract 

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) 
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  
   In particular, it describes managed objects for information related 
   to the Fibre Channel network's virtual fabrics function. At present, 
   this memo is a work item of T11.5 (http://www.t11.org). The plan is 
   that it will later become a work item of IETF's IMSS working group.

 Internet Draft         Virtual Fabrics MIB               March 2005 

      

 1.      Introduction 

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) 
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. 
   In particular, it describes managed objects for information related 
   to the Fibre Channel network's virtual fabric function. 

 2.      The Internet-Standard Management Framework 

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current 
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of 
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual 
   information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB. 
   MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network 
   Management Protocol (SNMP). 

   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the 
   Structure of Management Information (SMI). This memo specifies a MIB 
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, 
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 
   [RFC2580]. 

 3.      Short Overview of Fibre Channel 

   The Fibre Channel (FC) is logically a bidirectional point-to-point 
   serial data channel, structured for high performance. Fibre Channel 
   provides a general transport vehicle for higher level protocols such 
   as Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-
   Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet 
   Protocol), IEEE 802.2, and others. 

   Physically, Fibre Channel is an interconnection of multiple 
   communication points, called N_Ports, interconnected either by a 
   switching network, called a Fabric, or by a point-to-point link. A 
   Fibre Channel "node" consists of one or more N_Ports. A Fabric may 
   consist of multiple Interconnect Elements, some of which are 
   switches. An N_Port connects to the Fabric via a port on a switch 
   called an F_Port. When multiple FC nodes are connected to a single 
   port on a switch via an "Arbitrated Loop" topology, the switch port 
   is called an FL_Port, and the nodes' ports are called NL_Ports. The

 Internet Draft         Virtual Fabrics MIB               March 2005 

   term Nx_Port is used to refer to either an N_Port or an NL_Port. The 
   term Fx_Port is used to refer to either an F_Port or an FL_Port. A 
   switch port, which is interconnected to another switch port via an 
   Inter-Switch Link (ISL), is called an E_Port. A B_Port connects a 
   bridge device with an E_Port on a switch; a B_Port provides a subset 
   of E_Port functionality. 

   Many Fibre Channel components, including the fabric, each node, and 
   most ports, have globally-unique names. These globally-unique names 
   are typically formatted as World Wide Names (WWNs). More information 
   on WWNs can be found in [FC-FS]. WWNs are expected to be persistent 
   across agent and unit resets. 

   Fibre Channel frames contain 24-bit address identifiers which 
   identify the frame's source and destination ports. Each FC port has 
   both an address identifier and a WWN. When a fabric is in use, the 
   FC address identifiers are dynamic and are assigned by a switch. 
   Each octet of a 24-bit address represents a level in an address 
   hierarchy, with a Domain_ID being the highest level of the 
   hierarchy.  

   Virtual Fabrics allow a single physical Fabric to be divided into 
   multiple logical fabrics.  Each Virtual Fabric may be managed 
   independently like traditional Fabrics.  Virtual Fabrics are 
   designed to isolate events in one Virtual Fabric from affecting 
   other Fabrics. When one physical switch provides switching functions 
   for multiple Virtual Fabrics, that physical switch is modeled as 
   containing multiple virtual switches, one for each virtual fabric. 

   Each Virtual Fabric is identified by a 12-bit Virtual Fabric ID 
   (VF_ID). When frames from multiple Virtual Fabrics are transmitted 
   over a physical link, the VF_ID carried in a frameÆs Virtual Fabric 
   Tagging (VFT) Header identifies which Virtual Fabric the frame 
   belongs to.  The use of VFT Headers is enabled through an initial 
   negotiation exchange between the two connected ports.   

 4.      Relationship to Other MIBs 

   This MIB extends beyond [FC-MGMT] to cover the functionality, in 
   Fibre Channel switches, of providing Fibre Channel's virtual fabrics  
   function.

 Internet Draft         Virtual Fabrics MIB               March 2005 

 5.      MIB Overview 

   This MIB module provides the means for monitoring the operation of, 
   and configuring some parameters of, one or more instances of Fibre 
   Channel Virtual Fabric functionality. (Note that there are no 
   definitions in this MIB module of "managed actions" which can be 
   invoked via SNMP.) 

 5.1     Fibre Channel management instance 

   A Fibre Channel management instance is defined in [FC-MGMT] as a 
   separable managed instance of Fibre Channel functionality. Fibre 
   Channel functionality may be grouped into Fibre Channel management 
   instances in whatever way is most convenient for the 
   implementation(s). For example, one such grouping accommodates a 
   single SNMP agent having multiple AgentX [RFC2741] sub-agents, with 
   each sub-agent implementing a different Fibre Channel management 
   instance. 

   The object, fcmInstanceIndex, is IMPORTed from the FC-MGMT-MIB [FC-
   MGMT] as the index value to uniquely identify each Fibre Channel 
   management instance within the same SNMP context ([RFC3411] section 
   3.3.1). The t11vfVirtualSwitchTable augments the fcmSwitchTable, and 
   the primary index variable of the fcmSwitchTable is 
   fcmInstanceIndex.   

 5.2     Representing Physical and Virtual Switches 

   In the presence of virtual switches, fcmSwitchTable in the FC-MGMT-
   MIB contains a row for each virtual switch. fcmSwitchTable, 
   t11vfPhysicalSwitchTable and t11vfVirtualSwitchTable are 
   complementary. The t11vfPhysicalSwitchTable and 
   t11vfVirtualSwitchTable contain information that helps the 
   management client determine which switches are virtual switches and 
   how they correlate with physical switches.  

 6.      IANA Considerations 

   IANA is requested to make the OID assignment for the MIB module 
   under the appropriate subtree.

 8.      Security Considerations 

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module 
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such 
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their 
   sensitivity/vulnerability: 

   t11vfPhysicalMaxSupported, t11vfVirtualSwitchVfId, t11vfPortVfId, 
   t11vfPortTaggingStatus, t11vfEnabledVfId 

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), 
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is 
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the 
   objects in this MIB module. 

    

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features 
   as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),

 Internet Draft         Virtual Fabrics MIB               March 2005 

   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for 
   authentication and privacy). 

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to 
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate 
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them. 

 9.      To Do List 

   This MIB will need to be updated depending on terminology decisions 
   covered in 05-186v0.
