Various   transition mechanisms are defined to solve single transition issues.   They are supposed to be used once along the path of a single   communication.

This memo aims to identify cases   where multiple transition mechanisms can be involved, and what can   be the interaction effects between them. Krampell                                  Expires August 2001  [page 1]Internet Draft       Interaction of transition mechanisms      Feb 2001Table of Contents   1.

Introduction   This document discusses interaction of transition mechanisms that   can be involved in a communication between two end-points. Various   transition mechanisms are defined to solve single transition issues.   They are supposed to be used once along the path of a single   communication. During the transition phase separate network   architectures will introduce multiple transition mechanisms in   different ways.   This memo aims to identify realistic cases where two transition   mechanisms can be involved, and what the interaction effects between   them will be. Two different network topologies are considered : the   earlier transition phase involving a large IPv4 network and small   IPv6 islands, and the latter transition phase involving a large IPv6   network and small IPv4 islands.   This memo does not take into account quality of service or security   considerations. These are out of the scope of the document.   Section 2 defines the transition phases used in the document.   Section 3 defines and classifies the current transition mechanisms.   Section 4 discusses the transition mechanisms interaction in the   early transition phase. Section 5 discusses the transition   mechanisms interaction in the later transition phase.2. Definition of the transition phases   Early phase		large IPv4 ocean, interconnected IPv6 clouds.   Late phase		large IPv6 ocean, only partially connected IPv4                        clouds.3. Classification of single transition mechanisms   From the end-to-end point of view there are different types of   communication possible between two nodes.   . IPv4 source with IPv4 destination   . IPv6 source with IPv6 destination.   . IPv4 source with IPv6 destination   . IPv6 source with IPv4 destination.   Each transition mechanism  mentioned in this document applies to one   of the four cases above, and will be described in the following   sections.3.1 Connecting IPv4 sources and destinations over IPv6 networks (v4    host to v4 host).Krampell                                  Expires August 2001  [page 4]Internet Draft       Interaction of transition mechanisms      Feb 20013.1.1 Dual stack transition mechanism (DSTM)   Dual stack transition mechanism [DSTM] enables a full IPv4 end-to-   end communication between a dual stack node within an IPv6-only   network to an IPv4-only host. DSTM is based on tunnelling, using   dynamic tunnel interface combined with temporary IPv4 address   allocation provided by a DHCPv6 server. 3.2 Connecting IPv6 sources to IPv6 destinations over IPv4 networks (v6    host to v6 host)3.2.1 Tunnel Broker (TB)   Tunnel broker [BROKER] is mainly aimed at the isolated user or early   IPv6 adopter allowing rapid connectivity to a native IPv6 network   such as the 6Bone. The tunnel broker system automatically manages   the tunnel requests from end users thus reducing the management   overhead traditionally associated with the configuration of tunnels.   The tunnel broker assigns an IPv6 address to the dual stack host   which it returns along with its DNS name and client configuration   information. The TB method is aimed more at short term periods of   native IPv6 connectivity rather than providing long term access.3.2.2 6TO4   The 6to4 [6to4] method enables IPv6 sites to connect to other IPv6   sites over the legacy IPv4 Internet infrastructure. This method   will only be used in the early phase of transition from IPv4 to   IPv6 networks (large IPv4 ocean with small IPv6 islands). The aim   of this method is to allow isolated IPv6 sites (or hosts), which are   attached to an IPv4 network which has no native Ipv6 support, to   communicate with other IPv6 domains. The IPv6 host which uses this   method does not require an IPv4-compatible IPv6 address, or   configured tunnels. The presence of firewalls in IPv4 networks does   not affect the 6to4 mechanism as long as the 6to4 router has a   globally routable IPv4 address.3.2.3 6OVER4   The 6over4 [RFC2529] technique allows isolated IPv6 hosts to act   like fully functional IPv6 hosts even without direct contact with an   IPv6 router. 6over4 uses IPv4 multicast to create a   "virtual Ethernet".3.3 Communication between IPv4 source and IPv6 destination (v4 host to    v6 host)3.3.1 SOCKS   SOCKSv5 provides a mechanism for a gateway named "SOCKS Server" to   act as a relay of TCP and UDP connections between two end hosts.   One host will be behind the SOCKS Server which is usually in aKrampell                                  Expires August 2001  [page 5]Internet Draft       Interaction of transition mechanisms      Feb 2001   private network and the other host will be on the outside of that   network. The main points for this mechanism are:   - The host behind the SOCKS Server must use "socksified clients".     This means that SOCKSv5 installs an additional library in that     host, which acts as a "shim" layer between the application     (clients) and the transport layers. The applications need no     change, since this "shim" layer translates the socket calls     invoked by the application to the modified socket calls used in     the SOCKSv5 client-host to SOCKS-Server framework.   - One restriction of the SOCKS mechanism is that connections must     always be initiated by the internal host which is the one behind     the SOCKS Server. SOCKSv5 is considered a one way mechanism     although it can be configured to translate IPv4 to IPv6 or IPv6 to     IPv4.   - Since the SOCKS Server is a dual stack host and includes     translation protocol procedures according to the SIIT algorithm,     it can be configured to provide IPv4 to IPv6 translation or vice     versa but only one of them in a particular SOCKS Server machine.   - It is important also that security mechanisms to authenticate and     deny/permit access to internal hosts can be used in the SOCKS     Server.   In this way, a small or medium sized IPv4 network can provide access   to an IPv6 external network using a SOCKS Server in a dual stack   machine with access to both networks. When an internal IPv4 host   wants to establish a connection with an IPv6 external host it sends   a request to the SOCKS Server using the FQDN (Full Qualified Domain   Name) of the remote host. The SOCKS Server resolves that name to an   IPv6 address and sends a fake IPv4 address to the internal host.   So two connections are maintained: one TCP IPv4 connection between   the internal host and the gateway (UDP would be encapsulated in   TCP), and the other UDP or TCP IPv6 connection with the external   IPv6 host. Applications are not aware of all these processes, since   they make socket calls with the usual socket API and these calls are   intercepted by the "shim" SOCKSv5 layer.3.3.2 Network Address and Protocol Translator (NAT-PT)   NAT-PT allows native IPv6 hosts and applications to communicate with   native IPv4 hosts and applications, and vice versa. A NAT-PT device   resides at the boundary between an IPv6 and an IPv4 network.   NAT-PT provides a combination of header translation and address   translation. Header translation is necessary to convert an IPv4   header to IPv6 header format and vice versa. Address translation is   needed in order for hosts of one network to be able to identify   hosts of the other network using the native address format of the   first network. What this means is that an IPv4 host has to be able   to identify an IPv6 host using an IPv4 address and an IPv6 host has   to identify an IPv4 host via an IPv6 address. NAT-PT manages this   cross network identification.Krampell                                  Expires August 2001  [page 6]Internet Draft       Interaction of transition mechanisms      Feb 2001   NAT-PT allocates an IPv4 pool address when an IPv4 host is   communicating with an IPv6 host - the IPv4 pool address being used   to identify the IPv6 host. NAT-PT handles the mapping of the IPv4   pool address to the IPv6 host, during the duration of the session   between IPv4 and IPv6 host.   NAT-PT may optionally include a selection of Application Level   Gateways (ALG). ALGs are necessary where an IP application has   addresses embedded within the IP packet payload. Examples of this   are FTP and DNS. NAT-PT normally only converts the IP addresses   contained in the IP header. For these applications, NAT-PT must   investigate the packet payload and convert the embedded addresses   to the format of the destination network.3.3.3 Bump In The Stack (BIS)   The mechanism [RFC2767] consists in intercepting DNS requests from   an IPv4 application and adding a AAAA record to it. If the DNS   response indicates an IPv6 host, the IPv6 address is mapped to a   local IPv4 address and the traffic from the IPv4 application is   translated into IPv6 and vice versa.  This allows IPv4 hosts to   communicate with other IPv6 hosts using existing IPv4 applications.3.4 Communication between IPv6 source and IPv4 destination (v6 host to    v4 host)3.4.1 SOCKS   Read section 3.3.1 for more information on SOCKS. This mechanism can   be configured for communication between IPv4 source and IPv6   destination and vice versa.3.4.2 Network Address and Protocol Translator (NAT-PT)   Conversely to 3.3.2 above, an IPv6 host will identify an IPv4 host   via an IPv6 compatible IPv4 address. The IPv6 compatible IPv4   address is composed of the IPv4 address of the IPv4 host plus a 96   bit prefix added by NAT-PT. NAT-PT adds the prefix as a packet   passes from the IPv4 network to the IPv6 network and removes it from   packets passing in the opposite direction.   NAT-PT may optionally include a selection of Application Level   Gateways (ALG) (read section 3.3.2).3.4.3 Bump In The Stack (BIS)   When a BIS host receives an IPv6 datagram, the translator of the BIS   mechanism will try to translate the IPv6 packet into an IPv4 packet.   Since it does not know how to translate the IPv6 address, it willKrampell                                  Expires August 2001  [page 7]Internet Draft       Interaction of transition mechanisms      Feb 2001   request that the mapper provides a mapping for the IPv6 destination   and source address. The mapper will register its own IPv4 address as   the destination IPv6 address and pick an IPv4 address out of the   pool for the IPv6 source address. The translator can now translate   the packet and afterwards send it to the application.4.

Otherwise it will not work.4.3.4 Tunnel Broker combined with DSTM   This case is not applicable. The two mechanisms have different goals   and cannot fit together. Tunnel broker aims at allowing IPv6 end-to-   end communication between an isolated dual stack host within an IPv4   network and an IPv6-only host, while DSTM aims at allowing IPv4 end-   to-end communication between an isolated dual stack host within an   IPv6 network and an IPv4 only host.

Tunnel Broker is a tunnel type   mechanism that will be used in homogenous communications while   SOCKS is a translation type one, so their combination will not   happen in a three-cloud scenario.4.3.15 SOCKS combined with BIS   This case is not applicable.

The isolated IPv6 destination gains connectivity to an   IPv4 network using the 6over4 mechanism. The isolated IPv6   destination can also connect, using the 6over4 mechanism, to a   6over4 router and therefore is accessible from the IPv6 Internet.   Communication between source and destination is enabled. In this   scenario for the isolated IPv6 host to gain connectivity to an IPv4   network, this IPv4 network must support multicast. If the IPv4   network does not support multicast then the 6over4 mechanism cannot   be used.5.3.16 BIS combined with DSTM      In this scenario the combination is not possible. This is because   the DSTM mechanism connects a dual stack host in an IPv6 network   with an IPv4 host in an IPv4 network (IPv4 in IPv6 tunnelling),   whereas the BIS mechanism is used to enable connectivity between an   IPv4 application running on an IPv6 host with an IPv6 application on   an IPv6 host.5.3.17 6over4 combined with DSTM      This case is not applicable because 6over4 enables IPv6 end-to-end   communication between IPv6-only hosts within IPv6-only networks over   an IPv4-only network, while DSTM enables IPv4 end-to-end   communications between a dual-stack host within an IPv6-only network   and an IPv4-only host.6.

Parallel single transitions mechanism across multiple communications   This document focuses on the investigation of combining two   transition mechanisms. More complex scenarios combining more than 2   transition mechanisms are out of scope.   It is suspected that more problems occur if transition mechanisms   are cascaded.Krampell                                 Expires August 2001  [page 24]Internet Draft       Interaction of transition mechanisms      Feb 20018. Observations from the combination of mechanisms and conclusions   The main observation is that no particular issues are related to   combination of two transition mechanism. In both earlier and later   phases, some pair of mechanism do not fit together, some other pair   of mechanism fit together very well. In the other cases issues are   not due to the combination of two mechanisms, but is due to the own   limitations of one of the mechanism involved in the combination.8.1 Observations   There are several observations that can be made from the findings in   this document.   It is obvious that some transition mechanisms will cause problems at   some point in time during the transition to IPv6 networks. However,   network administrators and service providers, generally speaking,   users of transition mechanisms, should be very aware that these   problems exist. This can have am impact of the deployment of these   transition mechanisms.   Since various transition mechanism use different prerequisites it is   possible that some transition mechanisms will cause problems in   complex network scenarios. Again, network administrators and service   providers, generally speaking, users of transition mechanisms,   should be very aware that these problems exist. This can have an   impact on the deployment of these transition mechanisms.8.2 Conclusions   For deployment of IPv6, it is necessary to offer technical solutions   for various transition scenarios. None of the investigated single   transition mechanisms can solve all the problems during the various   phases of the transition from IPv4 to IPv6. However, the results   from this document show that the concurrent deployment of sometimes   complex transition mechanisms increases the complexity of a network   in transition.    The authors therefore propose to focus on developing recommendations   on how network operators should start and proceed with the   deployment of transition mechanisms. The authors of this memo   propose that further transition mechanisms should be required to   describe the interaction with existing transition mechanism to   prevent interaction problems.   The authors of this memo observe and conclude that the current   variety of transition mechanisms and its potential problems can   hinder the deployment of these mechanisms in a large scale.Krampell                                 Expires August 2001  [page 25]Internet Draft       Interaction of transition mechanisms      Feb 20019.
