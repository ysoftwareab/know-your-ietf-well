1. Introduction  
 
   This document specifies the payload format for sending BroadVoice 
   encoded speech or audio signals using the Real-time Transport 
   Protocol (RTP) [1].  The sender may send one or more BroadVoice 
   codec data frames per packet, depending on the application scenario,
   based on network conditions, bandwidth availability, delay 
   requirements, and packet-loss tolerance. 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2]. 
 
    
2. Background 

   BroadVoice is a speech codec family developed by Broadcom for VoIP 
   applications, including Voice over Cable, Voice over DSL, and IP 
   phone applications.  BroadVoice achieves high speech quality with 
   a low coding delay and relatively low codec complexity.  
  
   The BroadVoice codec family contains two codec versions. The
   narrowband version of BroadVoice, called BroadVoice16 [3], or BV16 
   for short, encodes 8 kHz-sampled narrowband speech at a bit rate of

   16 kilobits/second, or 16 kbit/s.  The wideband version of 
   BroadVoice, called BroadVoice32, or BV32, encodes 16 kHz-sampled 
   wideband speech at a bit rate of 32 kbit/s.  The BV16 and BV32 use 
   very similar (but not identical) coding algorithms; they share most 
   of their algorithm modules.

   To minimize the delay in real-time two-way communications, both the 
   BV16 and BV32 encode speech with a very small frame size of 5 ms 
   without using any look ahead.  This allows VoIP systems based on 
   BroadVoice to have a very low end-to-end system delay, by using a 
   packet size as small as 5 ms if necessary.

   BroadVoice also has relatively low codec complexity when compared 
   with ITU-T standard speech codecs based on CELP (Coded Excited 
   Linear Prediction), such as G.728, G.729, G.723.1, G.722.2, etc.
   Full-duplex implementations of the BV16 and BV32 take around 12 and 
   17 MIPS, respectively, on general-purpose 16-bit fixed-point DSPs.  
   The total memory footprints of the BV16 and BV32, including program 
   size, data tables, and data RAM, are around 12 kwords each, or 24 
   kbytes.

   The PacketCable(TM) project of Cable Television Laboratories, Inc.   
   (CableLabs(r)) has chosen the BV16 codec for use in VoIP (Voice 
   over Internet Protocol) telephone services provided by cable
   operators.  More specifically, the BV16 codec was selected as one 
   of the mandatory audio codecs in PacketCable (TM) 1.5 Audio/Video 
   Codecs Specification [4].  

     
3. RTP Payload Format for BroadVoice16 Narrowband Codec

   The BroadVoice16 uses 5 ms frames and a sampling frequency of 8 kHz,
   so the RTP timestamp MUST be in units of 1/8000 of a second.  The 
   RTP timestamp indicates the sampling instant of the oldest audio 
   sample represented by the frame(s) present in the payload.  The 
   RTP payload for the BroadVoice16 has the format shown in the figure 
   below.  No additional header specific to this payload format is 
   required.

   If BroadVoice16 is used for applications with silence compression, 
   the first BroadVoice16 packet after a silence period during which 
   packets have not been transmitted contiguously, SHOULD have the
   marker bit in the RTP data header set to one.  The marker bit 
   in all other packets is zero.  Applications without silence 
   suppression MUST set the marker bit to zero.

   The assignment of an RTP payload type for this new packet format is
   outside the scope of this document, and will not be specified here.
   It is expected that the RTP profile for a particular class of
   applications will assign a payload type for this encoding, or if 
   that is not done then a payload type in the dynamic range shall be 
   chosen.


3.1 BroadVoice16 Bit Stream Definition

   The BroadVoice16 encoder operates on speech frames of 5 ms 
   corresponding to 40 samples at a sampling rate of 8000 samples per 
   second.  For every 5 ms frame, the encoder encodes the 40 
   consecutive audio samples into 80 bits, or 10 octets.  Thus, the
   80-bit bit stream produced by the BroadVoice16 for each 5 ms frame 
   is octet-aligned, and no padding bits are required.  The bit 
   allocation for the encoded parameters of the BroadVoice16 codec 
   is listed in the following table.


      Encoded Parameter      Codeword     Number of bits per frame

      Total:                                      80 bits


   The mapping of the encoded parameters in an 80-bit BroadVoice16 data 
   frame is defined in the following figure.  This figure shows the bit 
   packing in "network byte order", also known as big-endian order.
   The bits of each 32-bit word are numbered 0 to 31, with the most 
   significant bit on the left and numbered 0.  The octets (bytes) of 
   each word are transmitted most significant octet first.  The bits of 
   data field for each encoded parameter are numbered in the same 
   order, with the most significant bit on the left.

3.2 Multiple BroadVoice16 Frames in an RTP Packet 
    
   More than one BroadVoice16 frame MAY be included in a single RTP 
   packet by a sender.  Senders have the following additional 
   restrictions: 
    
     o  SHOULD NOT include more BroadVoice16 frames in a single RTP 
        packet than will fit in the MTU of the RTP transport protocol. 
    
     o  MUST NOT split a BroadVoice16 frame between RTP packets.  
    
     o  BroadVoice16 frames in an RTP packet MUST be consecutive.
    
   Since multiple BroadVoice16 frames in an RTP packet MUST be 
   consecutive, and since BroadVoice16 has a fixed frame size of 5 ms, 
   recovering the timestamps of all frames within a packet is easy.  
   The oldest frame within an RTP packet has the same timestamp as the 
   RTP packet, as mentioned above.  To obtain the timestamp of the 
   frame that is N frames later than the oldest frame in the packet, 
   one simply adds 5*N ms worth of time units to the timestamp of the 
   RTP packet.  

   It is RECOMMENDED that the number of frames contained within an RTP 
   packet is consistent with the application.  For example, in a 
   telephony application where delay is important, the fewer frames per 
   packet the lower the delay, whereas for a delay insensitive 
   streaming or messaging application, many frames per packet would be 
   acceptable.

INTERNET DRAFT     RTP Payload format for BroadVoice      February 2005 
   

   Information describing the number of frames contained in an RTP
   packet is not transmitted as part of the RTP payload.  The only way
   to determine the number of BroadVoice16 frames is to count the total
   number of octets within the RTP payload, and divide the octet count 
   by 10.


4. RTP Payload Format for BroadVoice32 Wideband Codec

   The BroadVoice32 uses 5 ms frames and a sampling frequency of 16 
   kHz, so the RTP timestamp MUST be in units of 1/16000 of a second. 
   The RTP timestamp indicates the sampling instant of the oldest 
   audio sample represented by the frame(s) present in the payload.
   The RTP payload for the BroadVoice32 has the format shown in the 
   figure below.  No additional header specific to this payload format 
   is required.

   If BroadVoice32 is used for applications with silence compression, 
   the first BroadVoice32 packet after a silence period during which 
   packets have not been transmitted contiguously, SHOULD have the
   marker bit in the RTP data header set to one.  The marker bit 
   in all other packets is zero.  Applications without silence 
   suppression MUST set the marker bit to zero. 

   The assignment of an RTP payload type for this new packet format is

   The BroadVoice32 encoder operates on speech frames of 5 ms 
   corresponding to 80 samples at a sampling rate of 16000 samples per

   consecutive audio samples into 160 bits, or 20 octets.  Thus, the

   160-bit bit stream produced by the BroadVoice32 for each 5 ms frame 
   is octet-aligned, and no padding bits are required.  The bit 
   allocation for the encoded parameters of the BroadVoice32 codec

   The mapping of the encoded parameters in a 160-bit BroadVoice32 data 
   frame is defined in the following figure.  This figure shows the bit

   More than one BroadVoice32 frame MAY be included in a single RTP 
   packet by a sender.  Senders have the following additional 
   restrictions: 
    
     o  SHOULD NOT include more BroadVoice32 frames in a single RTP 
        packet than will fit in the MTU of the RTP transport protocol. 
    
     o  MUST NOT split a BroadVoice32 frame between RTP packets.  
    
     o  BroadVoice32 frames in an RTP packet MUST be consecutive. 
   
   Since multiple BroadVoice32 frames in an RTP packet MUST be 
   consecutive, and since BroadVoice16 has a fixed frame size of 5 ms, 
   recovering the timestamps of all frames within a packet is easy.  
   The oldest frame within an RTP packet has the same timestamp as the 
   RTP packet, as mentioned above.  To obtain the timestamp of the 
   frame that is N frames later than the oldest frame in the packet, 
   one simply adds 5*N ms worth of time units to the timestamp of the 
   RTP packet.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the number of frames contained within an RTP 
   packet is consistent with the application.  For example, in a 
   telephony application where delay is important, the fewer frames per 
   packet the lower the delay, whereas for a delay insensitive 
   streaming or messaging application, many frames per packet would be 
   acceptable.

   Information describing the number of frames contained in an RTP
   packet is not transmitted as part of the RTP payload.  The only way
   to determine the number of BroadVoice32 frames is to count the total
   number of octets within the RTP payload, and divide the octet count 
   by 20.


5. Storage Format

   The storage format is used for storing speech frames, e.g., as a 
   file or e-mail attachment.

   The file begins with a header that includes only a magic number to 
   identify the codec that is used.  The magic number for the 
   BroadVoice16 narrowband codec MUST correspond to the ASCII character 
   string "#!BV16\n", or "0x23 0x21 0x42 0x56 0x31 0x36 0x0A" in 
   hexadecimal format.  The magic number for the BroadVoice32 wideband 
   codec MUST correspond to the ASCII character string "#!BV32\n", or 
   "0x23 0x21 0x42 0x56 0x33 0x32 0x0A".  A file contains the encoded 
   bit stream of either BroadVoice16 or BroadVoice32, but not both.  In

INTERNET DRAFT     RTP Payload format for BroadVoice      February 2005 


   other words, BroadVoice16 frames and BroadVoice32 frames MUST NOT be
   mixed in the same file. 

   After the header that contains the magic number identifying the 
   codec used, the encoded codec data frames are stored in a sequential
   order, as shown below.  All encoded codec data frames must be 
   present, otherwise synchronization problems will arise.

   +--------+---------------+---------------+-----+---------------+
   | Header | Codec frame 1 | Codec frame 2 | ... | Codec frame N |
   +--------+---------------+---------------+-----+---------------+


6. IANA Considerations 
    
   Two new MIME sub-types as described in this section are to be 
   registered. 
 
   The MIME names for the BV16 and BV32 codecs are to be allocated from 
   the IETF tree since these two codecs are expected to be widely used
   for Voice-over-IP applications, especially in Voice over Cable 
   applications. 


6.1 MIME Registration of BroadVoice16 for RTP 
    
   MIME media type name: audio 
    
   MIME media subtype name: BV16 
 
   Required parameter: none   

   Optional parameters: 
      The following parameters apply to RTP transfer only.

      ptime:    Defined as usual for RTP audio (see RFC 2327 [5]).

      maxptime: See RFC 2327 [5] for its definition. The maxptime 
         SHOULD be a multiple of the duration of a single codec data 
         frame (5 ms).     
 
   Encoding considerations:
      This type is defined for transfer of BV16-encoded data via RTP
      using the payload format specified in Sections 3 of RFC XXXX. 
      It is also defined for other transfer methods using the storage 
      format specified in Section 5 of RFC XXXX. Audio data is binary 
      data, and must be encoded for non-binary transport; the Base64
      encoding is suitable for Email.  
 
   Security considerations:
      See Section 8 "Security Considerations" of RFC XXXX.

7. Mapping to SDP Parameters 
    
   The information carried in the MIME media type specification has a
   specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [5], which is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.  When SDP is
   used to specify sessions employing the BroadVoice16 or BroadVoice32 
   codec, the mapping is as follows:

      -  The MIME type ("audio") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name.

      -  The MIME subtype (payload format name) goes in SDP "a=rtpmap"
         as the encoding name.  The RTP clock rate in "a=rtpmap" MUST 
         be 8000 for BV16 and 16000 for BV32.

      -  The parameters "ptime" and "maxptime" go in the SDP "a=ptime"
         and "a=maxptime" attributes, respectively.

INTERNET DRAFT     RTP Payload format for BroadVoice      February 2005

 
   An example of the media representation in SDP for describing BV16 
   might be: 
    
     m=audio 49120 RTP/AVP 97 
     a=rtpmap:97 BV16/8000 

   An example of the media representation in SDP for describing BV32 
   might be: 
    
     m=audio 49122 RTP/AVP 99 
     a=rtpmap:99 BV32/16000 


7.1 Offer-Answer Model Considerations

   No special considerations are need for using the SDP Offer/Answer 
   model [6] with the BV16 and BV32 RTP payload formats.


8. Security Considerations  

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification 
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP 
   specification [1] and any appropriate profile (for example, [7]). 
   This implies that confidentiality of the media streams is achieved 
   by encryption.  Because the data compression used with this payload 
   format is applied end-to-end, encryption may be performed after 
   compression so there is no conflict between the two operations.
     
   A potential denial-of-service threat exists for data encoding using 
   compression techniques that have non-uniform receiver-end
   computational load. The attacker can inject pathological datagrams 
   into the stream which are complex to decode and cause the receiver 
   to become overloaded. However, the encodings covered in this 
   document do not exhibit any significant non-uniformity. 


9. Congestion Control

   The general congestion control considerations for transporting RTP 
   data apply to BV16 and BV32 audio over RTP as well, see RTP [1] 
   and any applicable RTP profile like AVP [7]. BV16 and BV32 do not 
   have any built-in mechanism for reducing the bandwidth. Packing 
   more frames in each RTP payload can reduce the number of packets 
   sent and hence the overhead from IP/UDP/RTP headers, at the 
   expense of increased delay and reduced error robustness against 
   packet losses.
