         A YANG Data Model for Transport Network Client Signals
                 draft-ietf-ccamp-client-signal-yang-05

Abstract

   A transport network is a server-layer network to provide connectivity
   services to its client.  The topology and tunnel information in the
   transport layer has already been defined by generic Traffic-
   engineered models and technology-specific models (e.g., OTN, WSON).
   However, how the client signals are accessing to the network has not
   been described.  These information is necessary to both client and
   provider.

   This draft describes how the client signals are carried over
   transport network and defines YANG data models which are required
   during configuration procedure.  More specifically, several client
   signal (of transport network) models including ETH, STM-n, FC and so
   on, are defined in this draft.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview

   A transport network is a server-layer network designed to provide
   connectivity services for a client-layer network to carry the client
   traffic transparently across the server-layer network resources.
   Currently the topology and tunnel models have been defined for
   transport networks, including [I-D.ietf-ccamp-otn-topo-yang] and
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-otn-tunnel-model], providing server-layer topology
   abstraction and tunnel configuration between PEs.  However, there is
   a missing piece for configuring how the PEs should map the client-
   layer traffic, received from the CE, over the server-layer tunnels:
   this gap is expected to be solved in this document.

   This document defines a data model of all transport network client
   signals, using YANG language defined in [RFC7950].  The model can be
   used by applications exposing to a transport network controller via a
   RESTconf interface.  Furthermore, it can be used by an application
   for the following purposes (but not limited to):

   o  To request/update an end-to-end service by driving a new tunnel to
      be set up to support this service;

   o  To request/update an end-to-end service by using an existing
      tunnel;

   o  To receive notification with regard to the information change of
      the given service;

   The YANG modules defined in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in [RFC8342].

1.2.  Prefixs in Model Names

   In this document, names of data nodes and other data model objects
   are prefixed using the standard prefix associated with the
   corresponding YANG imported modules, including [RFC6991], [RFC8294]
   and [I-D.ietf-ccamp-otn-tunnel-model], which are shown as follow.

2.  Terminology and Notations

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   this document.  The meaning of the symbols in the YANG data tree
   presented later in this document is defined in [RFC8340].  They are
   provided below for reference.

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      (read-write) and "ro" state data (read-only).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!"
      means a presence container, and "*" denotes a list and leaf-list.

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

3.  Transport Network Client Signal Overview

3.1.  Overview of Service Request and Network Configuration Scenarios

   A global view of a multi-domain service can be described as the
   Figure 1 . The customer is usually responsible to configure the CE
   nodes and to request to the provider the service intent, from the CE
   nodes perspective, while the provider is responsible to configure the
   whole network (including the PE nodes) to support the customer
   service intent.  Generally speaking, the network configurations
   required to support a customer service can be split into two
   different groups: CE-PE and PE-PE.  The CE-PE configuration deals
   with the client layer one-hop access link, while PE-PE configuration

   deals with the server layer tunnel.  In Figure 1 we mark the
   intermediate nodes as 'P', which has same switching capability of PE
   but just not the 'end-point'.  In this example, the link P-P and PE-P
   are a server-layer intra-domain or inter-domain link.

     Figure 1: Global view of Client Service with the Network Provider

   According to the responsibilities of each controller in [RFC8453],
   the controllers have different views of the service request and
   network configuration.  The duty of CNC is to give the MDSC a
   description of the customer service intent: candidate YANG models
   include L1CSM [I-D.ietf-ccamp-l1csm-yang], L2SM [RFC8466] and L3SM
   [RFC8299], which are classified as customer service models, according
   to [RFC8309].  These models provide necessary attributes to describe
   the customer service intent from the customer/CE perspective, and do
   not provide any specific network configuration.  These models also
   implies that the customer service description can be considered in a
   separate manner rather than integratig with network configurations,
   which also enable the controllers to abstract/virtualize the network
   resource to make them visible to the customer and also easier to
   manage.  In other words, the network knowledge is not necessary at
   CNC and CMI, which is seen in an abstracted form as shown in
   Figure 2.

   The functionalities of MDSC have been described in [RFC8453], which
   include the customer mapping/translation and multi-domain
   coordination.  By receiving the request from CNC, MDSC need to
   understand what network configuration can support the customer
   service intent and turn to the corresponding PNCs for configuration.
   The service request is therefore decomposed by MDSC into a few
   network configurations and forwarded to one or multiple PNCs
   respectively in single-domain and multi-domain scenario.  In general,
   the MDSC has the view of both PE and CE nodes and of some abstract
   information regarding the P nodes, as shown in Figure 3.  It is worth
   noting that this MDSC view is different with Figure 1 at the intra-
   domain link.  Usually these details are hidden, for scalability
   purposes, and therefore the MDSC has only an abstract view of each
   domain internal topology.

   PNC is the controller that configure the physical devices, based on
   the network configuration received from the MDSC.  Each PNC has the
   detailed view of its own domain, the example of view from PNC in
   domain 1 is shown in Figure 4.  The PNC has all the detailed topology
   information on PE and P nodes and on the intra-domain links.  The PNC
   configures the tunnel/tunnel segment within its domain based on the
   network configuration provided by the MDSC.  The PNC also configures

   the network part of the CE-PE access links as well as the mapping of
   the client-layer traffic and the server-layer tunnels, based on the
   network configuration provided by the MDSC.  The interaction between
   PNC and MDSC for the client-layer network configuration is
   accomplished by the models defined in this draft.

3.2.  Applicability of Proposed Model

   Existing TE and technology-specific models, such as topology models
   and tunnel models, support the network configuration among PEs and
   Ps.  The customer service models, such as L1CSM, L2SM and L3SM, focus
   on describing the attributes among CEs.  However, there is a missing
   piece on how to configure the CE-PE session.  The models defined in
   this document provide the configuration on CE-PE when the provider
   server-layer network is TE-based technology.

   In the example of OTN as the server-layer transport network, a full
   list of G-PID was summarized in [RFC7139], which can be divided into
   a few categories.  The G-PID signals can be categorized into
   transparent and non-transparent.  Examples of transparent signals may
   include Ethernetphysical interfaces, FC, STM-n and so on.  In this
   approach the OTN devices is not aware of the client signal type, and
   this information is only necessary among the controllers.  Once the
   OTN tunnel is set up, there is no switching requested on the client
   layer, and therefore only signal mapping is needed, without a client
   tunnel set up.  The models that supporting the configuration of
   transparent signals are defined in Section 4.2.  The other category
   would be non-transparent, such as Carrier Ethernet and MPLS-TP, with
   a switching request on the client layer.  Once the OTN tunnel is set
   up, a corresponding tunnel in the client layer has to be set up to

   carry services.  The models that supporting the configuration of
   transparent signals are defined in Section 4.1.

   It is also worth noting that some client signal can be carried over
   multiple types of networks.  For example, the Ethernet services can
   be carried over either OTN or Ethernet TE tunnels (over optical or
   microwave networks).  The model specified in this document allows the
   support from networks with different technologies.  The list of
   identities for client signals are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-layer1-types].

3.3.  State of Services

   States have been defined to retrieve the status of the delivered
   services.  A few generic states defined in [RFC8776] are reused in
   this document.  These states include the operational state and the
   provisioning state.

   A few other parameters are defined for the management of the
   services.  Given the complicated labor division, the creation, update
   and maintainance may have different responsible systems.  So the log
   of the service would be helpful and should be easy to retrived in a
   standard way as well.  These information include, but not restricted
   to the following:

   o  When the service is created and has been last updated, these are
      specified in the creation-time and last-updated-time.

   o  Who created the service and who made the last update to the
      service, these are specified in the created-by and last-updated-
      by.

   o  The owner of the service is specifed as owned-by, which would be
      useful when the service is delegated by or to a specific system.
      The identifier of the system is used to represent such
      information.

6.  Implementation Status

   [Note to the RFC Editor - remove this section before publication, as
   well as remove the reference to RFC [RFC7942].]

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].

   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

6.1.  Usage of the ETH Service YANG Model on ONAP

   The implementation of the CCVPN (Cross Domain and Cross Layer VPN)
   use-case on ONAP follows the ACTN [RFC8453] architecture.  In the
   design of CCVPN, ONAP presumes the responsibility of the MDSC, and
   third party network domain controllers the PNCs.  Consequently, the
   ETH Service YANG model is used as the MPI between ONAP and the domain
   controllers.

   o  Organization: China Mobile, Huawei Technologies, etc.

   o  Implementation: ONAP CCVPN uses the ETH Service YANG model as the
      ACTN MPI

   o  Description: ONAP CCVPN realizes the E-LINE and E-TREE service on
      a multi-domain network.  Both of the services are modeled on ONAP
      by the ETH Service YANG model, and the model instances (e.g., JSON
      objects) are sent between ONAP and the domain controllers.  Refer
      to the following CCVPN wiki for more information:
      https://wiki.onap.org/display/DW/
      CCVPN%28Cross+Domain+and+Cross+Layer+VPN%29+USE+CASE

   o  Maturity Level: Prototype

   o  Coverage: Partial

7.  IANA Considerations

   It is proposed that IANA should assign new URIs from the "IETF XML
   Registry" [RFC3688] as follows:


         URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-eth-tran-service
         Registrant Contact: The IESG
         XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

         URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-trans-client-service
         Registrant Contact: The IESG
         XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

         URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-eth-tran-types
         Registrant Contact: The IESG
         XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

         URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-trans-client-svc-types
         Registrant Contact: The IESG
         XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.


   This document registers following YANG modules in the YANG Module
   Names registry [RFC6020].

8.  Manageability Considerations

   TBD.

9.  Security Considerations

   The data following the model defined in this document is exchanged
   via, for example, the interface between an orchestrator and a network
   domain controller.

   The YANG module defined in this document can be accessed via the
   RESTCONF protocol defined in [RFC8040], or maybe via the NETCONF
   protocol [RFC6241].

   There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG module which are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., POST) to these
   data nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.
