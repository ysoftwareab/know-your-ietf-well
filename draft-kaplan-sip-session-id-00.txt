Abstract 
    
   There are several reasons for having a globally unique session 
   identifier for the same SIP session, which can be maintained across 
   B2BUA's and other SIP middle-boxes.  This draft proposes a new SIP 
   header to carry such a value: Session-ID.

1. Introduction 
    
   The SIP [RFC3261] Call-ID header value is a globally unique 
   identifier, mandatory in all requests/responses, which identifies 
   SIP messages belonging to the same dialog or registration.  It 
   provides a portion of the SIP message dialog-matching criteria, and 
   is used in [Replaces] headers and [dialog-events] package for 
   matching to such, and in [SIP-Identity] and [Connected-identity] as 
   one of the inputs for signing. 
    
   Unfortunately, the Call-ID is often changed by B2BUA's and other 
   such middle-boxes in the end-to-end message path.  A B2BUA logically 
   represents a UAS and UAC, and as such may use a new Call-ID value 
   for the dialog it creates on its UAC half; but there are several 
   use-cases for having a common, consistent end-to-end identifier, as 
   described later in this draft. 
    
   There are several reasons the Call-ID value is changed by B2BUA's.  
   There are security and privacy reasons, since Call-ID values

   typically contain UA IP Addresses; some B2BUA's need to change them 
   to keep track of spiraling dialogs; and some need to change them to 
   keep track of separate forks.  In fact, some have argued a B2BUA has 
   no choice but to create a new one, in order to strictly comply with 
   RFC 3261 as a UAC.  In general, B2BUA's modify the Call-ID value in 
   both directions, "fixing" it to be what each side of the B2BUA would 
   expect.  This works fine if the B2BUA is in the message path, and 
   knows all SIP message or body contents which use or reference the 
   value.  However for subsequent out-of-dialog requests, or new SIP 
   uses, a B2BUA often does not or cannot "fix" the value correctly. 
    
   Therefore, in order to provide an identifier which will not be 
   modified/replaced by B2BUA's, this draft proposes a new SIP Header 
   "Session-ID", and mandatory rules for the value of such a header.  
   The rules are designed to be such that the value in the Session-ID 
   header is not considered unsafe, private, or have any property which 
   would cause B2BUA's to change it.  The goal of this draft is to 
   enable use-cases which need a unique identifier for a given session 
   which can successfully cross B2BUA's. 
    
    
1.1. Example use-cases for Session-ID 
    
   The need for a unique identifier is driven by the following use-
   cases: 
   1. Certain SIP applications need to reference dialogs in out-of-
      dialog requests at a layer above the SIP message dialog matching 
      rules, and wish it to work across B2BUA domains.  For example, 
      the SIP Media Control Channel Framework [media-ctrl] needs to 
      reference a dialog identifier used between a UAC and UAS by a 
      third party.  The mechanism originally used the Call-ID and 
      remote/local-tags for such matching, but changed due to concerns 
      over B2BUA's changing them, and now uses a new cfw-id SDP 
      attribute.   
   2. Multiple RFC 3265 Event packages use the Call-ID value in their 
      package bodies to reference established sessions, even though 
      they don't actually need to match a Call-ID per se - and should 
      work across B2BUA domains.  These packages could be updated to 
      include a Session-ID XML attribute as an alternative, optional 
      matching criteria. 
   3. Several proposed and documented identity verification mechanisms 
      need a hard-to-guess dialog identifier for verification.  For 
      example, RFC 4474 uses the Call-ID header value in its signature 
      to prevent replay/copy-paste attacks, even though it does not 
      need a Call-ID value per se; it just needs a unique dialog 
      identifier.  Likewise, [draft-derive] wishes to perform a reverse 
      dialog-verification to verify a caller identity based on some

      unique identifier for the dialog; [draft-pass] creates a header-
      parameter to perform something similar. 
   4. Some SIP service providers implement call admission control (CAC) 
      for bandwidth, and only allow SIP INVITE requests if the network 
      has sufficient bandwidth for the given SDP.  If a call request is 
      forked by B2BUA's, or crosses them, however, the CAC model treats 
      each fork as a separate call because there is no identifier to 
      tie them together.  This leads to rejected forks due to CAC, when 
      they should have been allowed to proceed.  A common identifier 
      would provide the information to correlate the requests.  
      Currently proprietary SIP headers are used for this purpose. 
   5. Troubleshooting SIP sessions is more complicated if multiple legs 
      of the session are on different sides of B2BUA's, due to the lack 
      of a common identifier to tie the legs together.  Currently 
      proprietary mechanisms are used to achieve this. 
   6. When SIP requests cross B2BUA's, the only form of loop detection 
      that will stop a loop is the Max-Forwards hop-count limit being 
      reached (value reaching zero).  Via header values are removed by 
      B2BUA's, so both spirals and simple loops cannot be detected by 
      Via branch-parameter matching.  A Session-ID value could be used 
      to detect loops by imposing a limit on the number of times the 
      same Session-ID can cross the same B2BUA.  This would be a local 
      decision, and an optimization, but it would be useful. 
    
2. Terminology 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.  The 
   terminology in this document conforms to RFC 2828, "Internet 
   Security Glossary". 
    
3. Applicability 
    
   This draft proposes a new SIP header for all requests and responses. 
    
4. Overview of Operation 
    
   The general concept is that the UAC generating an out-of-dialog 
   request generates a new, pseudo-random, unique value which remains 
   constant for the duration of the transaction, any dialog created 
   from the request, or a registration.  The value is based on the 
   rules for creating a pseudo-random value (a UUID?), and is inserted 
   in a new Session-ID header defined in this draft.   
    
   This Session-ID is not used for message dialog-matching rules in RFC 
   3261, nor does it change the Call-ID usage, nor does it replace the

   Call-ID value.  Instead this new header value provides an identifier 
   for other uses. 
    
5. Session-ID Behavior 
    
5.1. Generating a Session-ID value 
    
   This draft proposes the Session-ID header value be generated based 
   on a defined mechanism for creating a 128-bit pseudo-random value, 
   and encode it as its lower-case hex representation.  The reason for 
   specifying the mechanism, and its length, is to make it impossible 
   to determine the manufacturer of the device which generated it by 
   looking at its format or value.  For example, the theoretically 
   random "session id" value in SDP origin line has been found to be 
   fairly vendor-specific in nature, and one can narrow the vendor that 
   generated the SDP simply by the origin session id value. (In fact, 
   this drove some SBC's to modify that SDP field for "anonymization" 
   purposes) 
    
   One proposal is to generate it based on the rules for a UUID as 
   defined in RFC 4122. [NOTE: the actual mechanism to use is TBD] 
    
5.2. UAC Behavior 
    
   The rules for when a UAC generates a new Session-ID value are 
   similar as those for Call-ID value: a UAC supporting this draft MUST 
   generate a *new* unique Session-ID value whenever it generates an 
   out-of-dialog request, or for a new Registration.  The UAC MUST re-
   use the same Session-ID for any out-of-dialog request it retransmits 
   or re-generates in response to a 3xx, or it re-formulates due to 
   failure responses. 
    
   Session-ID values in Registration refreshes - REGISTER requests 
   which are used to update the expiry time but not to register a new 
   contact - MUST use the same Session-ID value as previous REGISTER 
   requests. 
    
   The UAC MUST include the Session-ID header and value in any out-of-
   dialog request, including Registration refreshes, and any 
   retransmitted or regenerate out-of-dialog request.  It MAY include 
   them in in-dialog requests or responses, but since they are not used 
   for dialog-matching rules this is not mandatory, and MUST NOT cause 
   dialog or transaction failure if they do not match previous ones. 
 
5.3. Proxy Behavior 
    
   A Proxy MUST NOT remove or modify the Session-ID header values it 
   receives.  If the Proxy forks a request, it MUST copy the same 
   Session-ID value into all the forked request copies. If the Proxy

                        SIP Session Identifier           November 2008 
 
 
   recurses requests due to 3xx redirection, or regenerates requests 
   due to failures, it MUST use the same Session-ID value, just as the 
   UAC does. 
    
5.4. B2BUA Behavior 
    
   A B2BUA MUST copy the Session-ID it receives in requests as a UAS, 
   into the related requests it generates as a UAC; and any Session-ID 
   value it receives in responses as a UAC into the correlated 
   responses it generates as a UAS.  If the B2BUA forks or creates 
   multiple requests as a UAC, from a request it received as a UAS, the 
   B2BUA MUST copy the same Session-ID header value it received into 
   all the forks/requests.  If the B2BUA recurses requests due to 3xx 
   redirection, or regenerates requests due to failures, it MUST use 
   the same Session-ID value, just as the UAC does. 
    
5.5. UAS Behavior 
    
   A UAS MAY copy the received Session-ID value into responses and 
   subsequent upstream requests within the dialog. 
    
6. New Header

   Session-ID  r   o   o   o   o   o   o   o   o   o   o   o   o   o 
    
   The header is only mandatory for out-of-dialog requests; for others 
   it is optional. [Open Issue: should this be mandatory for all?] 
    
6.1. "Session-ID" header 
    
   This draft proposes Session-ID to be added to the definition of the 
   element "message-header" in the SIP message grammar. 
    
   The Session-ID header is a single-instance header. 
    
6.2. Augmented BNF Definitions 
    
   Session-ID           =  "Session-ID" HCOLON sess-id 
                           *( SEMI generic-param ) 
   sess-id              =  32(DIGIT / %x61-7A)  ; 32 chars of [0-9a-z] 
    
   NOTE: The sess-id value is case-SENSITIVE, just as Call-ID is, 
   however only lower-case characters are defined and allowed.

7. Example Exchange 
 
   In the following example, Alice initiates a call to Bob.  Alice 
   generates a Session-ID header in the out-of-dialog INVITE. 
    
   Alice generates the following: (note: much has been left out for 
   simplicity) 
      INVITE sip:bob@example.com SIP/2.0 
      Via: SIP/2.0/UDP 192.0.2.1:5060;branch=z9hG4bKnashds10 
      From: Alice <sip:alice@example.net>;tag=1234567 
      To: Bob <sip:bob@example.com> 
      Call-Id: 123456mcmxcix@1.2.3.4 
      Session-ID: f81d4fae7dec11d0a76500a0c91e6bf6 
      CSeq: 1 INVITE 
      Contact: <sip:alice@192.168.1.1> 
    
8. Security Considerations 
    
   There are no specific security issues for this mechanism, beyond 
   those already applicable to SIP-based session signaling. [TBD]
