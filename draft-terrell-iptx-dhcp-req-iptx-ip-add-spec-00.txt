Abstract
    
    
    This document defines the changes when the IP Bit Mapped Header Size
    Specification Equals 64 Bits, as would be required for the Implementation
    Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to support hosts defined by the
    IPtX IP Addressing Protocol Family Specification. Furthermore, while
    the underlining implications regarding any Change in the Header Size
    Specification maintains the possibility of having a Profound Cascading
    Affect upon other Protocols. Noting specifically, the affects upon the 'TCP'
    and 'UDP' Headers, and the corresponding affects upon the Growth in the
    Number of Available 'PORTS'. Nevertheless, while there is a noticeable
    growth occurring in each of these areas, they remain manageable, because the
    difference between the IPv4 and the IPtX Specification is minimal. In which
    case, it should be clearly understood, the Operations presently defined for
    the IPv4 IP Addressing System would be the same under the IPt1
    Specification. And this is valid because the differences between their IP
    Addressing Schematic Design does not mandate a requirement for any change,
    and they both use the same 32Bit Header Size Specification.

    In other words, the implementation of the IPtX Specification has little or
    No affect, nor does it constitute an appreciable change in the Dynamic Host
    Configuration Protocol Specification, which is Currently used in the IPv4 IP
    Addressing System. Hence, this work should only be considered as an
    extension of the RFC(s) governing and supporting the Dynamic Host
    Configuration Protocol (DHCP) for the IPv4 Specification, because the only
    objective this paper maintains, is the development and presentation of the
    IPtX DHCP Specification, which only compliments the requirements in the
    current RFC(s) defining the DHCP Protocol Specification.

Chapter I: Current Specifications: The IPv4 DHCP Server and the IPt1
           Specification


    The acronym 'DHCP' is the abbreviation for 'Dynamic Host Configuration
    Protocol', which is an Application Protocol used to Automate the Assignment
    of the Network; Information, Connection, and Configuration of the Host, or
    Devices (Node) for their Connection to the Network representing their
    Network Domain.

    Nevertheless, quoting the current definitions from the Introduction given
    in RFC2131 [8]:

    "The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides configuration
     parameters to Internet hosts. DHCP consists of two components: a
     protocol for delivering host-specific configuration parameters from a
     DHCP server to a host and a mechanism for allocation of network
     addresses to hosts.

     DHCP is built on a client-server model, where designated DHCP server
     hosts allocate network addresses and deliver configuration parameters
     to dynamically configured hosts. Throughout the remainder of this
     document, the term "server" refers to a host providing initialization
     parameters through DHCP, and the term "client" refers to a host
     requesting initialization parameters from a DHCP server."






    Nevertheless, while I could continue quoting from the various RFCs
    outlining the requirements for the DHCP Services [8]. The point to be
    made however, is that; since there is absolutely No change with the
    implementation of the IPt1 Specification from that required by the
    IPv4 Specification, it would be redundant to continue. In other words,
    barring the differences in their respective Addressing Schematics, these IP
    Addressing Specifications are Mirror Images, which represents an identity
    allowing for complete compatibility, because these IP Addressing Systems use
    the Same Default IP Addressing Structure / Format.

Chapter  II: The IPtX DHCP Specification, and the Implications of the
                 'Zone IP', and 'IP Area Code' Prefix Addresses


    The IPtX DHCP Specification, using a 64 Bit Header Size Format, should only
    be viewed as an Extension and Enhancement of the current DHCP Services used
    in the IPv4 Specification. That is, while preserving the Foundational
    Functions and Definitions, which governs and services the IPv4
    Specification. The implementation of the IPtX DHCP Specification should
    only be viewed as extending the Size Parameters, as would be necessary to
    accommodate the 64 Bit Header Size Specification. However, there are
    consequences, foreseen and unforeseen, which are Directly associated with
    the IP Header Size Specification, that can Directly and Indirectly maintain
    dire effects cascading across the entire system. In fact, it could quite
    easily be the conclusion; 'Any IP Header Size Specification beyond 64 bits,
    would have Unmanageable Consequences Prorogating throughout the entire IP
    Addressing System'. These consequences would maintain such a profound
    effect, that the only way to Reduce the Adverse Impact resulting from
    Changing the Header Size Specification, would be the development of New
    Specifications for the affected Areas within the IP Addressing System. Even
    still, this procedure might not Suffice. However, a Temporary Fix could
    sustain the overall Addressing System from a Cycle of Continuous Break-Downs
    and Repairs, Until the Entire System Could Be Re-Written.    

    As an example nevertheless, consider the Growth in the Number of Ports
    Available, which is one of the consequences resulting from, and directly
    effected by the Header Size Specification, as shown in Table 1.

    The ramifications comprising the consequences resulting from the effects of
    changing the HEADER Size Specifications, to say the very least, are clearly
    profound. And while Table 1 demonstrates the need to exercise caution when
    specifying the HEADER Size Specifications, there can still be benefits. That
    is, if the all of the parameters within or effected by the resulting Growth
    of the Header Specification [1], which are effected or Changed by a
    proportional amount, and remain Stable and Manageable. Then the benefits
    derived from the IPtX Specification, using only the 'Zone' IP Address for
    differentiation, provides the ability to Assigning Port Numbers for Private
    use by the Consumer, which could have the affect of providing additional
    Security to allow Secure and Private access to Control Networked Appliances
    (Household Appliances, and other Networked Devices), or linking Wireless
    Remotes for sharing the Carrier Wave of Radio Frequency Transmissions. This
    method, which is similar to the VPN, or ATM(s), could also provide Secure
    Links for Commercial, Governmental, Medical, Educational, Research, and
    Military uses within each Zone IP Address Location, because there are more
    than 4 Billion Ports available to each Zone IP Address Location. And while
    after configuration, these Ports could be invisible to the User(s), the
    flexibility for Access could still be controlled, and the level of Security
    they provide, could be greater than the Firewall Technology currently used
    today.

    Nevertheless, the IPtX DHCP Specification represents only the changes
    that are required by the 64 Bit Header Size Specification [1], which are
    reflected by Changes Noted in Table 2, and described in Figures 5 through     
    7 as being a proportional increase relative to the increase in the Header
    Size. In other words, the IPtX DHCP 64 Bit Header Size Specification
    reflects a uniform increase of the Controls within the Header itself, which
    provides an easy transition for backward compatibility with the IPv4 DHCP
    Specification.

    Note*: While the expansion of the IP Address within the Header, is
           incremented in '8 Bit' Segments. The increase in the Total Size 
           of the IP Address beyond the Current Header Specifications,
           is accomplished using '32 Bit' increments, which increases the
           overall size of the Header itself. This is, as it should be,
           because it reflects the size of the 'Base IP Addressing Schematic';
           'IPt1'. Thus, preserving the Logic and Mathematical Continuity,
           which is the actual integrity of the System's Foundation, that

    Nevertheless, while triggering the Alarm, as shown by the analysis of the
    data in Table 1, might seem more like a scare tactic. It is in fact, a call
    for an investigation regarding the Size Limits, which should be imposed upon
    the Growth of the Header Size Specification used in any IP Addressing
    System. Furthermore, the data analysis resulting from Table 1 is indeed
    indicative of the Cascading Consequences effecting every Protocol, who's
    Length is Derived from the Header Size Specification. Moreover, while the
    IPtX IP Addressing Protocol Family Specification maintains an Unlimited IP
    Address Size Specification, the built in constraints it maintains, Limits
    the Header Size Specification to 64 Bits [1], which provides a more
    Rational, Stable, and Manageable approach to IP Addressing. In other words,
    once the Parameters has been Adjusted for the 64 Bit Header Specification,
    with the exception of IPt1, the parameters remain valid throughout the
    remaining IPtX Addressing Protocols contained in this IP Addressing Protocol
    Family Specification.

Chapter III: Security Considerations [8]




   This document, whose primary objective was the Development of the IPtX DHCP
   Specification does not Challenge the Security Procedures specified for the
   Current DHCP Specification. However, DHCP was intended to make maintenance of
   remote and diskless Clients automatic. And while it may be difficult and
   inconvenient, the configuration of passwords and authorization keys, so far,
   remains the only option. Nevertheless, since the DHCP Services is inherently
   insecure. The provisions for a 'Network Security Identification' (NSID)
   Number, which is a Hidden 16Bit HEX Authorization Number Assigned by the
   Operating System Server to the DHCP Server, that could be verified and
   confirmed by the client during Logon with the Network Domain Server after
   configuration. Would clearly be a Boon for the prevention of the Rogue DHCP
   Services, which are masquerading as a DHCP Service attached to the Network
   Domain. Needless to say, this feature would be a significant enhancement over
   the Security features currently Specified for the IPv4 DHCP Specification,
   and could quite easily be employed in the New Specification for the IPtX DHCP
   Services.
