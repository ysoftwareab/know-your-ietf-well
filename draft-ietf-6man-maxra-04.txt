        Support for adjustable maximum router lifetimes per-link
                        draft-ietf-6man-maxra-04

Abstract

   The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol specifies the maximum time
   allowed between sending unsolicited multicast Router Advertisements
   from a router interface as well as the maximum router lifetime.  It
   also allows the limits to be overridden by link-layer specific
   documents.  This document allows for overriding these values on a
   per-link basis.

1.  Introduction

   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery relies on IP multicast based on the
   expectation that multicast makes efficient use of available bandwidth
   and avoids generating interrupts in the network nodes.  On some
   datalink layers multicast may not be natively supported.  On such
   links, any possible reduction of multicast traffic will be highly
   beneficial.  Unfortunately, due to the fixed protocol constants
   specified in [RFC4861], it is difficult to relax the multicast timers
   for neighbor discovery.  There are already link technology specific
   clarifications describing how to tune the Neighbor Discovery Protocol
   (NDP) constants for certain systems with in order to reduce excess
   NDP traffic. e.g.  [RFC6459][RFC7066] contain such clarifications for
   3GPP cellular links.

   This document specifies updates to the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
   Protocol [RFC4861] for increasing the the maximum time allowed
   between sending unsolicited multicast Router Advertisements (RA) from
   a router interface as well as for the maximum router lifetime.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Relationship between AdvDefaultLifetime and MaxRtrAdvInterval

   MaxRtrAdvInterval is an upper bound on the time between which two
   successive Router Advertisement messages are sent.  Therefore one
   might reason about the relationship between these two values in terms
   of a ratio K=AdvDefaultLifetime/MaxRtrAdvInterval, which expresses
   how many Router Advertisements will be guaranteed to be sent before
   the router lifetime expires.

   Assuming unicast Solicited Router Advertisements or a perfectly
   stable network, on a theoretically perfect link with no losses, it
   would have been sufficient to have K just above 1 - so that the sent
   Router Advertisement refreshes the router entry just before it
   expires.  On the real links which allow for some loss, one would need
   to use K>2 in order to minimize the chances of a single router
   advertisement loss causing a loss of the router entry.

   The exact calculation will depend on the packet loss probability.  An
   example: if we take a ballpark value of 1% probability of a packet
   loss, then K=2 will give 0.01% percent chance of an outage due to a
   packet loss, K=3 will give 0.0001% chance of an outage, and so forth.
   To reverse the numbers, with these parameters, K~=1 gives 99%
   reliability, K~=2 gives 99.99% reliability, and K~=3 gives 99.9999%
   reliability - the latter should be good enough for a lot of
   scenarios.

   In a network with higher packet loss probabilities or if the higher
   reliability is desired, the K might be chosen to be even higher.  On
   the other hand, some of the data link layers provide reliable
   delivery at layer 2 - so there one might even consider using the
   "theoretical" value of K just above 1.  Since the choice of these two
   parameters does not impact interoperability per se, this document
   does not impose any specific constraints on their values other than
   providing the guidelines in this section, therefore each individual
   link can optimize accordingly to its use case.

   Also AdvDefaultLifetime MUST be set to a value greater than or equal
   to the selected MaxRtrAdvInterval.  Otherwise, a router lifetime is
   guaranteed to expire before the new Router Advertisement has a chance
   to be sent, thereby creating an outage.

4.  Updates to RFC4861

   This document updates Section 4.2 and Section 6.2.1. of [RFC4861] to
   update the following router configuration variables.

   In Section 4.2, inside the paragraph that defines Router Lifetime,
   change 9000 to 65535 seconds.

   In Section 6.2.1, inside the paragraph that defines
   MaxRtrAdvInterval, change 1800 to 65535 seconds.

   In Section 6.2.1, inside the paragraph that defines
   AdvDefaultLifetime, change 9000 to 65535 seconds.

   As explained in Section 3, the relationship between MaxRtrAdvInterval
   and AdvDefaultLifetime must be chosen to take into account the
   probability of packet loss.

5.  Host Behavior

   Legacy hosts on a link with updated routers may have issues with a
   Router Lifetime of more than 9000 seconds.  In the few
   implementations we have tested with general purpose operating
   systems, there does not seem to be any issues with setting this field
   to more than 9000, but there might be implementations that
   incorrectly (since RFC4861 requires receivers to handle any value)
   reject such RAs.

6.  Security Considerations

   On a link where router advertisements are few and far between, the
   detrimental effects of a rogue router that sends an unsolicited RA
   are greatly increased.  These rogue RAs can be prevented by using
   approaches like RA-Guard [RFC6105] and SeND [RFC3971]

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any IANA action.
