1. Introduction  
 
   This document specifies the payload format for sending BroadVoice 
   encoded speech or audio signals using the Real-time Transport 
   Protocol (RTP) [1].  The sender may send one or more BroadVoice 
   codec data frames per packet, depending on the application scenario,
   based on network conditions, bandwidth availability, delay 
   requirements, and packet-loss tolerance. 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2]. 
 
    
2. Background 

   BroadVoice [3] is a speech codec family developed by Broadcom for 
   VoIP applications, including Voice over Cable, Voice over DSL, and 
   IP phone applications.  BroadVoice achieves high speech quality with 
   a low coding delay and relatively low codec complexity.  
  
   The BroadVoice codec family contains two codec versions. The 
   narrowband version of BroadVoice, called BroadVoice16, or BV16 for 
   short, encodes 8 kHz-sampled narrowband speech at a bit rate of 
   16 kilobits/second, or 16 kbit/s. The wideband version of 
   BroadVoice, called BroadVoice32, or BV32, encodes 16 kHz-sampled 
   wideband speech at a bit rate of 32 kbit/s.  The BV16 and BV32 use 
   very similar (but not identical) coding algorithms; they share most 
   of their algorithm modules.
 
   To minimize the delay in real-time two-way communications, both the 
   BV16 and BV32 encode speech with a very small frame size of 5 ms 
   without using any look ahead.  This allows VoIP systems based on 
   BroadVoice to have a very low end-to-end system delay, by using a 
   packet size as small as 5 ms if necessary.

   BroadVoice also has relatively low codec complexity when compared 
   with other ITU-T standard speech codecs based on CELP (Coded Excited 
   Linear Prediction), such as G.728, G.729, G.723.1, G.722.2, etc.
   Full-duplex implementations of the BV16 and BV32 take around 12 and 
   17 MIPS, respectively, on general-purpose 16-bit fixed-point DSPs.  
   The total memory footprints of the BV16 and BV32, including program 
   size, data tables, and data RAM, are around 12 kwords, or 24 kbytes.

3. RTP Payload Format for BroadVoice16 Narrowband Codec

   The BroadVoice16 uses 5 ms frames and a sampling frequency of 8 kHz,
   so the RTP timestamp MUST be in units of 1/8000 of a second. The RTP 
   payload for the BroadVoice16 has the format shown in the figure 
   below.  No additional header specific to this payload format is 
   required.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

   When more than one codec data frame is present in a single RTP 
   packet, the timestamp is, as always, that of the oldest data frame 
   represented in the RTP packet.

   If BroadVoice16 is used for applications with silence compression, 
   the first BroadVoice16 packet after a silence period during which 
   packets have not been transmitted contiguously, SHOULD have the
   the marker bit in the RTP data header set to one.  The marker bit 
   in all other packets is zero.  Applications without silence 
   suppression MUST set the marker bit to zero.

   The assignment of an RTP payload type for this new packet format is
   outside the scope of this document, and will not be specified here.
   It is expected that the RTP profile for a particular class of
   applications will assign a payload type for this encoding, or if 
   that is not done then a payload type in the dynamic range shall be 
   chosen.


3.1 BroadVoice16 Bit Stream Definition

   The BroadVoice16 encoder operates on speech frames of 5 ms 
   corresponding to 40 samples at a sampling rate of 8000 samples per 
   second.  For every 5 ms frame, the encoder encodes the 40 
   consecutive audio samples into 80 bits, or 10 octets.  Thus, the
   80-bit bit stream produced by the BroadVoice16 for each 5 ms frame 
   is octet-aligned, and no padding bits are required.  The bit 
   allocation for the encoded parameters of the BroadVoice16 codec 
   is listed in the following table.

   frame is defined in the following figure.  This figure shows the bit 
   packing in "network byte order", also known as big-endian order.

3.2 Multiple BroadVoice16 Frames in An RTP Packet 
    
   More than one BroadVoice16 frame may be included in a single RTP 
   packet by a sender.  Senders have the following additional 
   restrictions: 
    
     o  SHOULD NOT include more BroadVoice16 frames in a single RTP 
        packet than will fit in the MTU of the RTP transport protocol. 
    
     o  MUST NOT split a BroadVoice16 frame between RTP packets.  
    
     o  BroadVoice16 frames in an RTP packet MUST be consecutive.


Chen et al.                                                    [Page 4]


INTERNET DRAFT     RTP Payload format for BroadVoice     September 2003 
    

   It is RECOMMENDED that the number of frames contained within an RTP 
   packet is consistent with the application.  For example, in a 
   telephony application where delay is important, the fewer frames per 
   packet the lower the delay, whereas for a delay insensitive 
   streaming or messaging application, many frames per packet would be 
   acceptable. 
   
   Information describing the number of frames contained in an RTP
   packet is not transmitted as part of the RTP payload.  The only way
   to determine the number of BroadVoice16 frames is to count the total
   number of octets within the RTP packet, and divide the octet count 
   by 10.


4. RTP Payload Format for BroadVoice32 Wideband Codec

   The BroadVoice32 uses 5 ms frames and a sampling frequency of 16 
   kHz, so the RTP timestamp MUST be in units of 1/16000 of a second. 
   The RTP payload for the BroadVoice32 has the format shown in the 
   figure below.  No additional header specific to this payload format 
   is required.

   |             one or more frames of BroadVoice32                | 
   |                                                               | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

   When more than one codec data frame is present in a single RTP 
   packet, the timestamp is, as always, that of the oldest data frame 
   represented in the RTP packet.

   If BroadVoice32 is used for applications with silence compression, 
   the first BroadVoice32 packet after a silence period during which 
   packets have not been transmitted contiguously, SHOULD have the
   the marker bit in the RTP data header set to one.  The marker bit 
   in all other packets is zero.  Applications without silence 
   suppression MUST set the marker bit to zero.

   The BroadVoice32 encoder operates on speech frames of 5 ms

   consecutive audio samples into 160 bits, or 20 octets.  Thus, the
   160-bit bit stream produced by the BroadVoice32 for each 5 ms frame 
   is octet-aligned, and no padding bits are required.  The bit

4.2 Multiple BroadVoice32 Frames in An RTP Packet 
    
   More than one BroadVoice32 frame may be included in a single RTP 
   packet by a sender.  Senders have the following additional 
   restrictions: 
    
     o  SHOULD NOT include more BroadVoice32 frames in a single RTP

INTERNET DRAFT     RTP Payload format for BroadVoice     September 2003 


   Information describing the number of frames contained in an RTP
   packet is not transmitted as part of the RTP payload.  The only way
   to determine the number of BroadVoice32 frames is to count the total
   number of octets within the RTP packet, and divide the octet count 
   by 20.


5. Storage Format

   The storage format is used for storing speech frames, e.g., as a 
   file or e-mail attachment.

   The file begins with a header that includes only a magic number to 
   identify the codec that is used.  The magic number for the 
   BroadVoice16 narrowband codec MUST correspond to the ASCII character 
   string "#!BV16\n", or "0x23 0x21 0x42 0x56 0x31 0x36 0x0A" in 
   hexadecimal format.  The magic number for the BroadVoice32 wideband 
   codec MUST correspond to the ASCII character string "#!BV32\n", or 
   "0x23 0x21 0x42 0x56 0x33 0x32 0x0A".  A file contains the encoded 
   bit stream of either BroadVoice16 or BroadVoice32, but not both.  In
   other words, BroadVoice16 frames and BroadVoice32 frames MUST NOT be
   mixed in the same file. 

   After the header that contains the magic number identifying the 
   codec used, the encoded codec data frames are stored in a sequential
   order, as shown below. 

   +--------+---------------+---------------+-----+---------------+
   | Header | Codec frame 1 | Codec frame 2 | ... | Codec frame N |
   +--------+---------------+---------------+-----+---------------+


6. IANA Considerations 
    
   Two new MIME sub-types as described in this section are to be 
   registered. 
 
   The MIME names for the BV16 and BV32 codecs are to be allocated from 
   the IETF tree since these two codecs are expected to be widely used
   for Voice-over-IP applications, espcially in Voice over Cable 
   applications.


6.1 MIME registration of BroadVoice16 
    
   MIME media type name: audio 
    
   MIME media subtype name: BV16 
 
   Required Parameter: none

INTERNET DRAFT     RTP Payload format for BroadVoice     September 2003 
   

   Optional parameters: 
      The following parameters apply to RTP transfer only.

      ptime:    Defined as usual for RTP audio (see RFC 2327).

      maxptime: The maximum amount of media which can be encapsulated
         in each packet, expressed as time in milliseconds. The time
         SHALL be calculated as the sum of the time the media present
         in the packet represents. The time SHOULD be a multiple of the
         duration of a single codec data frame (5 ms).    
 
   Encoding considerations:
      This type is defined for transfer of BV16-encoded data via RTP
      using the payload format specified in Sections 3 of RFC xxxx. 
      It is also defined for other transfer methods using the storage 
      format specified in Section 5 of RFC xxxx. Audio data is binary 
      data, and must be encoded for non-binary transport; the Base64
      encoding is suitable for Email.  
 
   Security considerations:
      See Section 8 "Security Considerations" of RFC xxxx.   
 
   Public specification:
      The BroadVoice16 codec has been specified in [3].

   Additional information:
      The following information applies to storage format only.
    
      Magic number: ASCII character string "#!BV16\n" (or "0x23 0x21 
         0x42 0x56 0x31 0x36 0x0A" in hexadecimal)

      File extensions: bvn, BVN (stands for "BroadVoice, Narrowband")

      Macintosh file type code: none

      Object identifier or OID: none
 
   Intended usage:
      COMMON. It is expected that many VoIP applications, especially
      Voice over Cable applications, will use this type.

7. Mapping To SDP Parameters 
    
   The information carried in the MIME media type specification has a
   specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [4], which is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.  When SDP is
   used to specify sessions employing the BroadVoice16 or BroadVoice32 
   codec, the mapping is as follows:

      -  The MIME type ("audio") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name.

      -  The MIME subtype (payload format name) goes in SDP "a=rtpmap"
         as the encoding name.  The RTP clock rate in "a=rtpmap" MUST 
         be 8000 for BV16 and 16000 for BV32.

      -  The parameters "ptime" and "maxptime" go in the SDP "a=ptime"
         and "a=maxptime" attributes, respectively.

      -  Any remaining parameters go in the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute by
         copying them directly from the MIME media type string as a
         semicolon separated list of parameter=value pairs.
  
   An example of the media representation in SDP for describing BV16 
   might be: 
    
     m=audio 49120 RTP/AVP 97 
     a=rtpmap:97 BV16/8000 

   An example of the media representation in SDP for describing BV32 
   might be: 
    
     m=audio 49122 RTP/AVP 99 
     a=rtpmap:99 BV32/16000 


8. Security Considerations 
 
   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification 
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP 
   specification [1] and any appropriate profile (for example, [5]). 
   This implies that confidentiality of the media streams is achieved 
   by encryption.  Because the data compression used with this payload 
   format is applied end-to-end, encryption may be performed after 
   compression so there is no conflict between the two operations.



Chen et al.                                                   [Page 11]

INTERNET DRAFT     RTP Payload format for BroadVoice     September 2003 

     
   A potential denial-of-service threat exists for data encoding using 
   compression techniques that have non-uniform receiver-end 
   computational load. The attacker can inject pathological datagrams 
   into the stream which are complex to decode and cause the receiver 
   to become overloaded. However, the encodings covered in this 
   document do not exhibit any significant non-uniformity.
