INTERNET-DRAFT              QUIC Multiplexing            23 October 2017


1.  Introduction

   There are a number of ways in which communication between WebRTC
   peers may utilize QUIC. One of these is transport of RTP over QUIC,
   described in [I-D.rtpfolks-quic-rtp-over-quic].  Another is use of
   QUIC [I-D.ietf-quic-transport] for data exchange. A Javascript API
   for use of QUIC in WebRTC data exchange has been incorporated into
   the ORTC API [ORTC], under development within the W3C ORTC Community
   Group.

   In a WebRTC scenario where ICE [RFC5245] is utilized for NAT
   traversal, SRTP [RFC3711] is keyed using DTLS-SRTP [RFC5764] and QUIC
   is used for data exchange, RTP/RTCP [RFC3550] STUN [RFC5389], TURN
   [RFC5766], DTLS [RFC6347], ZRTP [RFC6189] and QUIC may all need to be
   multiplexed over a single ICE transport.

   As noted in [RFC7983] Figure 3, protocol demultiplexing currently
   relies upon differentiation based on the first octet, as follows:

                       +----------------+
                       |        [0..3] -+--> forward to STUN
                       |                |
                       |      [16..19] -+--> forward to ZRTP
                       |                |
           packet -->  |      [20..63] -+--> forward to DTLS
                       |                |
                       |      [64..79] -+--> forward to TURN Channel
                       |                |
                       |    [128..191] -+--> forward to RTP/RTCP
                       +----------------+

        Figure 1: DTLS-SRTP receiver's packet demultiplexing algorithm.

   As noted by Colin Perkins and Lars Eggert in [QUIC-Issue] this
   creates a potential conflict with the current design of the QUIC
   headers described in [I-D.ietf-quic-transport], since the first octet
   of the QUIC header is either:

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |1|   Type (7)  |  Long header packet
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   which potentially produces values of the first octet in the range
   129-134, conflicting with RTP/RTCP, or

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |0|C|K| Type (5)|  Short header packet
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+



Aboba, et. al                 Informational                     [Page 3]

INTERNET-DRAFT              QUIC Multiplexing            23 October 2017


   which produces values for the first octet in the ranges 1-3, 33-35,
   65-67 or 97-99, potentially conflicting with STUN, DTLS and TURN.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Solutions

   This section presents potential solutions to the QUIC multiplexing
   problem, including changes to the QUIC headers, addition of a
   multiplexing octet and use of heuristics.

2.1.  QUIC Header Changes

   As noted in [QUIC-Issue], one potential solution involves changes to
   the QUIC headers, such as setting the top two bits of the first octet
   of a QUIC packet to 1.  This would imply a reduction in the size of
   the type fields:

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |1|1|1|Type (5) |  Long header packet
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |1|1|0|C|K|Type3|  Short header packet
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Note: [QUIC-Spin] proposes to add a spin bit to the type octet within
   the QUIC header, in order to allow for RTT calculation.  This would
   leave 4 bits for the type field in the long header packet and 2 bits
   for the type field in the short header, which would accomodate the
   type field values allocated in [I-D.ietf-quic-transport].

2.1.1.  Pros and Cons

   The advantage to this approach is that it adds no additional overhead
   on-the-wire.  However it does require a reduction in the size of the
   QUIC Type fields and could potentially require allocation of the
   following initial octet code points for QUIC: For the Long header,
   225-230 (241-246 when the spin bit is set) and for the Short header,
   193-195 (209-11 with spin bit set), 209-211 (225-227 with spin bit
   set) and 217-219 (233-235 with the spin bit set).  Utilizing all of
   these code points for QUIC would leave limited code points available
   for future allocations.

INTERNET-DRAFT              QUIC Multiplexing            23 October 2017


2.2.  Multiplexing Shim

   In this approach, an initial octet not allocated within [RFC7983]
   would be prepended to each QUIC packet, allowing QUIC packets to be
   differentiated from RTP, RTCP, DTLS, STUN, TURN and ZRTP based on the
   first octet alone. As an example, an octet with decimal value 192
   could be used:

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

2.2.1.  Pros and Cons

   Advantages of this approach include simplicity and the consumption of
   only a single initial octet code point for demultiplexing of QUIC.
   The disadvantage is the addition of a single octet of overhead to
   every QUIC packet, which could impact performance where small
   payloads are exchanged, such as in peer-to-peer gaming.

2.3.  Heuristics

   During the QUIC WG interim in Seattle, Martin Thomson suggested the
   following heuristics for differentiation of QUIC packets from
   RTP/RTCP/DTLS/STUN/TURN/ZRTP:

   1. Demultiplex differently during the "QUIC handshake"
      and "steady state".
   2. During handshake, we only need to worry about the QUIC
      Long header, which simplifies the logic.
       a. Force all handshake packets to utilize the QUIC Long header.
       b. The QUIC Long header (0x1XXXXXXX) (or 0x11XXXXXX with
          the spin bit set) does not conflict with STUN (0x000000XX),
          DTLS (0x000XXXXX), or TURN Channel (0x01XXXXXX).
       c. The QUIC Long header does conflict with RTP/RTCP (0x10XXXXXX),
          but those packets typically aren't sent until the QUIC
          handshake is completed. Corner case: an application starts
          off with audio and video keyed with DTLS-SRTP without QUIC,
          then the application wishes to add QUIC data (e.g. the user
          clicks on the "white-board" icon).
           i. Alternative: force the RTP padding bit to 1
              using a one-byte pad if there isn't already
              padding (pad == 0x01).  Then force QUIC to have
              a type < 64 (the current max is 8).
          ii. Alternative: Disallow QUIC in this case, use SCTP data
              exchange instead.
   3. During "steady state", we only need to worry about the QUIC
      Short header.



Aboba, et. al                 Informational                     [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT              QUIC Multiplexing            23 October 2017


       a. QUIC doesn't need the Long header after the handshake.
       b. The QUIC Short header (0x0XXXXXXX or 0x01XXXXXX with
          the spin bit set) does not conflict with RTP/RTCP
          (0x10XXXXXX), so we only need to worry about
          conflicts with STUN/TURN/DTLS/ZRTP.
       c. Disallow simultaneous use of DTLS and QUIC
          Short header packets.
            i. Alternative: when using DTLS and QUIC at the same
               time, only use the QUIC Long header. Not optimal,
               but isn't really needed.
       d. ICE can be demuxed using the magic cookie and checksum.
            i. Alternative: STUN can only conflict with 3
               QUIC packet types: Version Negotiation,
               Client Initial, and Server Stateless Retry.
               Out of those, none should be needed during
               the steady state.
       e. You shouldn't need to demultiplex QUIC with TURN channel
          data or other STUN traffic. But what about consent
          packets?

2.3.1.  Pros and Cons

   This approach has the advantage that it requires no changes to QUIC
   headers, nor does it add any overhead to QUIC packets. Disadvantages
   include additional complexity within the multiplexing algorithm, the
   consumption of additional multiplexing code points, and potential
   future difficulties in adapting the algorithm to support changes to
   the QUIC protocol or additional protocols to be multiplexed.

3.  Security Considerations

   The solutions discussed in this document could potentially introduce
   some additional security considerations beyond those detailed in
   [RFC7983].

   Due to the additional logic required, if mis-implemented, heuristics
   have the potential to misclassify packets.

   When QUIC is used for only for data exchange, the TLS-within-QUIC
   exchange [I-D.ietf-quic-tls] derives keys used solely to protect the
   QUIC data packets.  If properly implemented, this should not affect
   the transport of SRTP nor the derivation of SRTP keys via DTLS-SRTP,
   but if badly implemented, both transport and key derivation could be
   adversely impacted.
