2. Abstract

This document defines a schema for storing attributes used by the 
MIT implementation of Kerberos Version 5 Key Distribution Center 
(KDC) service in a directory that implements the Lightweight 
Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Version 3.  The directory must 
implement the LDAP Version 3 protocol as defined in RFC 2251 [2], 
RFC 2252 [3], RFC 2253 [4], and RFC 2256 [5].  The schema defined 
in this document is referred to as the "KDC LDAP schema."

The KDC LDAP schema includes definitions for the following 
attributes:

*  Attributes defining a realm--These attributes map to 
attributes defined in the KDC.conf file of the MIT 
implementation.
   
*  Attributes defining principals--These attributes map to 
attributes defined in RFC 1510 [6] and the principal and 
administration databases of the MIT implementation.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",  
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this    
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [6].

3. Overview

The KDC LDAP schema is designed to meet five objectives.  The 
first objective is to use LDAP schema definitions defined in RFC 
2252 and RFC 2256.  The second objective is to use LDAP schema 
definitions defined in existing LDAP implementations.  The third 
objective is to provide a way of sharing common security 
attributes, such as password policy attributes, with non-Kerberos 
applications.  The fourth objective is to provide a way of 
protecting keys and other sensitive information.  The fifth 
objective is to promote inter-operability between different 
implementations of the Kerberos KDC.

The following figure illustrates the KDC LDAP schema:

 :----------:      :------------:



3.1 Realm Entry 

The attributes defining a realm are included in the KrbRealm 
structural object class and the KrbRealmExt auxiliary object 
class.  These attributes must be stored in an entry that is 
referred to as the "realm entry." The RDN of the realm entry must 
be "krbRealmName=<realm_name>", where realm name is the name of 
the realm.  The following attributes are required:

*  krbRealmName--The name of the realm

*  krbPrincSubTree--The DN of each entry representing a sub-tree 
under which principals in the realm reside

*  krbKdcServiceObject--The DN of each entry representing a KDC 
service in the realm.

The following is an example of a realm entry:

  DN: krbRealmName=PAYROLL, ou=Austin
  objectclass: KrbRealm
  krbRealmName: Payroll
  krbPrincSubTree: cn=users, ou=Austin
  objectclass: KrbRealmExt
  krbKdcServiceObject: serviceName=serverA, dc=payroll, ou=Austin
  krbKdcServiceObject: serviceName=serverB, dc=payroll, ou=Austin
  <additional KrbRealmExt attributes>



3.2 Realm Policy Attributes

The attributes defining the policy for the realm are included in 
the KrbPolicy auxiliary object class.  These attributes must be 
stored in the realm entry, an entry referenced by the 
krbPolicyObject attribute of the realm entry, or both entries.  
If the same policy attribute is stored in both entries, the 
policy attribute in the realm entry takes precedence.

The following is an example with the policy attributes configured 
in the realm entry:

  DN: krbRealmName=PAYROLL, ou=Austin
  objectclass: KrbRealm
  objectclass: KrbRealmExt
  <KrbRealm and KrbRealmExt attributes>
  objectclass: KrbPolicy
  <KrbPolicy attributes>

The following is an example with the policy attributes configured 
in a referenced entry:

  DN: krbRealmName=PAYROLL, ou=Austin
  objectclass: KrbRealm
  objectclass: KrbRealmExt
  <KrbRealm and KrbRealmExt attributes>
  krbPolicyObject: cn=MyPolicy, ou=Austin

  DN: cn=MyPolicy, ou=Austin
  objectclass: PasswordPolicy
  <PasswordPolicy attributes>
  objectclass: KrbPolicy
  <KrbPolicy attributes>


3.3 Master Key (KrbMstrKey) Entries (Optional) 

The schema provides an optional way of configuring master key 
attributes in LDAP.  To use this optional configuration, the 
krbMstrKeyCfg attributes needs to be configured in the realm 
entry with the value KRBMSTRKEY.

The attributes defining each master key in the realm are included 
in the KrbMstrKey structural object class.  If the realm is 
configured for KRBMSTRKEY, the master key attributes for each 
master key must be stored in a master key entry that resides 
directly below the realm entry.  The RDN of this entry must 
include the string "krbKeyVersion=<version>", where <version> is 
the version of the master key.  The RDN also can include 
additional strings if this is required to uniquely identify the 
master key entry (or example, "krbKeyVersion=1 
krbKDCServiceName=serverA"). 

The following attributes are required:
  
*  either the master key value (krbKeyValue) or the URL address 
where the master key is stored (krbKeyRef) 
*  the encryption type of the master key (krbEncType)
*  the key version configured in the required RDN (krbKeyVersion)

The following is an example of a realm configured for KRBMSTRKEY. 
In this example, the realm contains one master key entry, which 
is shared by all the KDC services in the realm.  The master key 
value is stored in a private file accessible by all the KDC 
services in the realm.

  DN: krbKeyVersion=1, krbRealmName=PAYROLL, ou=Austin
  objectclass: KrbMstrKey
  krbEncType: 1
  krbKeyVersion: 1
  krbKeyRef: FILE://private/mstrkey


3.4 Principal Entries 

The attributes defining each principal in the realm are included 
in the KrbPrincipal auxiliary object class.  These attributes can 
be stored in any entry that meets the following requirements:

*  The entry must reside under a sub-tree listed in the 
krbPrincSubTree attribute of the entry representing the realm in 
which the principal will reside 

*  The entry must not already be configured to represent a 
Kerberos principal

The entry where the KrbPrincipal attributes are stored is 
referred to as a "principal entry."  A principal entry must 
contain the krbPrincipalName attribute.  This attribute contains 
the Kerberos identity of the principal in the format 
"<principal>@<realm>", where <principal> is the name of the 
principal and <realm> is the name of the realm.   The Kerberos 
principal identity must be unique within the realm.  

The following figure is an example of a person entry configured 
as a principal entry:

  DN: cn=Alice Smith, cn=users, ou=Austin
  objectclass: Person
  cn: Alice Smith
  <additional Person attributes>
  objectclass: KrbPrincipal
  krbPrincipalName: alice@PAYROLL
  <additional KrbPrincipal attributes>



3.5 Principals Associated with Other Entries (Optional)

The schema provides an optional way of associating a principal 
entry with another entry through the use of aliases.  This 
association is ignored by the KDC, but can be used by higher-
level applications to associate a principal with a target entry 
and to verify that the target entry accepts this association.  

There are several reasons why it might be necessary to configure 
alias associations.  One reason is to allow an entry already 
configured with a principal identity to be associated with other 
principal identities.  Another reason is to allow an entry 
configured in a remote part of the directory to be associated 
with a principal identity configured in a local part of the 
directory.  A third reason is to allow an entry configured in a 
less secure part of the directory to be associated with a 
principal identity configured in more secure part of the 
directory.     

The association is configured by doing both of the following:

*  adding the krbAliasedObjectName attribute from the KrbAlias 
auxiliary object class to the principal entry and configuring 
krbAliasedObjectName to reference the target entry

*  adding krbHintAliases attribute from the KrbAlias auxiliary 
object class to the target entry and configuring krbHintAliases 
attribute to reference the principal entry.

The following is an example in which the Alice Smith person 
entry, which already is configured as the principal identity of 
alice@PAYROLL, is associated with a second principal identity of 
alice@PURCHASING.

  DN: cn=Alice Smith, cn=users, ou=Austin
  objectclass: Person
  cn: Alice Smith
  <additional Person attributes>
  objectclass: KrbPrincipal
  krbPrincipalName: alice@PAYROLL
  <additional KrbPrincipal attributes>
  objectclass:  KrbAlias
  krbHintAliases:  cn=alice@PURCHASING, krbRealmName=PURCHASING, 
ou=Austin

  DN: cn=alice@PURCHASING, krbRealmName=PURCHASING, ou=Austin
  objectclass: Person
  cn: alice@PURCHASING
  sn: alice@PURCHASING
  objectclass: KrbPrincipal
  krbPrincipalName: alice@PURCHASING
  <additional KrbPrincipal attributes>
  objectclass:  KrbAlias
  krbAliasedObjectName:  cn=Alice Smith, cn=users, ou=Austin

The following is an example of an association between a principal 
entry for bob@PAYROLL and a person entry for Bob Jones that 
exists in a remote part of the directory:

  DN: cn=bob@PAYROLL, cn=users, ou=Austin
  objectclass: Person
  cn: bob@PAYROLL
  sn: bob@PAYROLL
  objectclass: KrbPrincipal
  krbPrincipalName: bob@PAYROLL
  <additional KrbPrincipal attributes>
  objectclass:  KrbAlias
  krbAliasedObjectName:  cn=Bob Jones, ou=Raleigh

  DN: cn=Bob Jones, ou=Raleigh
  objectclass: Person
  cn: Bob Jones
  <additional Person attributes>
  objectclass: KrbAlias
  krbHintAliases: cn=bob@PAYROLL, cn=users, ou=Austin


3.6 Principal Policy Attributes  

The attributes defining the policy for the principal are included 
in the KrbPolicy auxiliary object class.  These attributes must 
be stored in the principal entry, an entry referenced by the 
krbPolicyObject of the principal entry, or both entries.  If the 
same policy attribute is stored in both entries, the policy 
attribute in the principal entry takes precedence. 



3.7 Principal Key (KrbKey) Entries (Optional)

The attributes defining each secret key associated with a 
principal are included in the KrbKey structural object class.  If 
a principal uses the default method of storing secret keys, the 
attributes defining each secret key associated with the principal 
must be stored in a KrbKey entry that resides directly under the 
principal entry.  The RDN of this entry must include the string 
"krbKeyVersion=<version>", where <version> is the version of the 
key.  The RDN also can include additional strings if this is 
required to uniquely identity the KrbKey entry (for example, 
"krbkeyVersion=1, krbEncType=1, krbSaltType=0).  

The following attributes are required:

*  the version of the key included in the required RDN 
(krbKeyVersion)

*  the key value (krbKeyValue), which must be encrypted with a 
master key
 
*  the encryption type of the key (krbEncType)

*  the version of the master key used to encrypted the key value 
(krbMstrKeyVersion)

The creator of a KrbKey entry must be a trusted DN (a DN that is 
listed in either the krbKdcServiceObject, krbPwdServiceObject or 
krbTrustedAdmObject attribute of the realm entry).  The trusted 
DN is responsible for doing the following:

1.  Get a secret password or a sequence of secret keys from the 
principal. 

2.  If a secret password is supplied, use a string-to-key 
algorithm to generate a secret key for each supported key type.  
The string-to-key algorithm must be consistent with the string-
to-key algorithm described in RFC 1510, taking into consideration 
the salt type of the key type.

3.  If a sequence of secret keys is supplied, verify that each 
key type is supported.

4.  Encrypt each secret key with each master key that is of the 
same encryption type (or have one or more KDC services do this).

5.  Create a KrbKey entry for each encrypted secret key.  Store 
the encrypted secret key in the KrbKey entry along with 
information required to generate the encrypted secret key from a 
password.

As an alternative to the default method of storing secret keys, a 
principal can be configured to use a USERPASSWORD or PROPRIETARY 
method of storing secret keys.  This is configured by adding the 
krbSecretKeyCfg attribute to the principal entry and configuring 
this attribute with a value of USERPASSWORD or PROPRIETARY.  If a 
principal is configured for USERPASSWORD, the secret key of the 
principal is the password of the principal and this password is 
stored in the the userPassword attribute of the principal entry.  
If the principal is configured for PROPRIETARY, the secret key or 
keys of the principal is stored in a proprietary database not 
defined in the KDC LDAP schema. 

The following is an example of a configuration that uses the 
default method of storing secret keys.  In this example, four 
KrbKey entries are configured for a single principal, each having 
a different set of encryption and salt types:

  DN: krbEncType=1 krbSaltType=0, cn=Alice Smith, cn=users, 
ou=Austin
  objectclass: KrbKey
  krbEncType: 1
  krbKeyVersion: 1
  krbMstrKeyVersion: 1
  krbKeyValue: <encrypted key>
  krbSaltType: 0
  krbSaltValue: <salt value>

  DN: krbEncType=1 krbSaltType=1, cn=Alice Smith, cn=users, 
ou=Austin
  objectclass: KrbKey
  krbEncType: 1
  krbKeyVersion: 1
  krbMstrKeyVersion: 1
  krbKeyValue: <encrypted key>
  krbSaltType: 1
  krbSaltValue: <salt value>

  DN: krbEncType=5 krbSaltType=0, cn=Alice Smith, cn=users, 
ou=Austin
  objectclass: KrbKey
  krbEncType: 5
  krbKeyVersion: 1
  krbMstrKeyVersion: 1
  krbKeyValue: <encrypted key>
  krbSaltType: 0
  krbSaltValue: <salt value>

  DN: krbEncType=5 krbSaltType=1, cn=Alice Smith, cn=users, 
ou=Austin
  objectclass: KrbKey
  krbEncType: 5
  krbKeyVersion: 1
  krbMstrKeyVersion: 1
  krbKeyValue: <encrypted key>
  krbSaltType: 1
  krbSaltValue: <salt value>


3.8 Principal Log (KrbLog) Entries

The attributes defining a login activity record for a principal 
are included in the KrbLog structural object class.  These 
attributes must be stored in the KrbLog entry that resides 
directly below the principal entry.  The RDN of this entry must 
be "cn=KrbLog".  The creator of this entry must be a DN that 
represents a KDC service in the realm (a DN listed in the 
krbKdcServiceObject attribute of the realm entry) 

The following is an example of a KrbLog entry.  

  DN: cn=KrbLog, cn=Alice Smith, cn=users, ou=Austin
  objectclass: KrbLog
  <KrbLog attributes>



4. Syntaxes

The KDC LDAP schema uses the following syntaxes in attribute type 
definitions:

*  Syntaxes listed in RFC 2252

*  The interval syntax

The interval syntax is defined in the Microsoft Active Directory 
schema.  The definition is as follows:

(
1.2.840.113556.1.4.906
NAME 'Interval'
DESC 'Large integer.  Use for 64-bit values.
)



5. Attribute Types

The KDC LDAP schema uses the attribute types listed in this 
section and RFC 2256.

7. Security Considerations

AUTHENTICATION DISCLOSURE:

   This document describes a directory access protocol that provides
   both read and update access.  Update access requires secure
   authentication, but this document does not mandate implementation
   of any satisfactory authentication mechanisms.

   In accordance with RFC 2026, section 4.4.1, this specification
   is being considered by IESG as a proposed standard
   despite this limitation, for the following reasons:

   a. to encourage implementation and interoperability testing of
      these protocols (with or without update access) before they
      are deployed, and

   b. to encourage deployment and use of these protocols in read-only
      applications.  (e.g. applications where LDAPv3 is used as
      a query language for directories which are updated by some
      secure mechanism other than LDAP), and

   c. to avoid delaying the advancement and deployment of other
      Internet standards-track protocols which require the ability
      to query, but not update, LDAPv3 directory servers.

   Readers are hereby warned that until mandatory authentication
   mechanisms are standardized, clients and servers written according
   to this specification which make use of update functionality are
   UNLIKELY TO INTER-OPERATE, or MAY INTER-OPERATE ONLY IF
   AUTHENTICATION IS REDUCED TO AN UNACCEPTABLY WEAK LEVEL.

   Implementers are hereby discouraged from deploying LDAPv3 clients
   or servers which implement the update functionality, until a
   Proposed Standard for mandatory authentication in LDAPv3 has been
   approved and published as an RFC.


The following needs to be considered when using the KDC LDAP 
schema:

* Any identity that configures KDC attributes in LDAP is 
responsible for the ensuring that the attributes are transmitted 
securely to and from LDAP.  If attributes must be transmitted 
over the network, they must be transmitted using a security 
protocol with client and server authentication, data integrity, 
and, if the attribute contains key data, encryption that is as 
strong or stronger than DES.  

* Any identity that adds a sub-tree entry to the krbPrincSubTree 
attribute of the realm entry is responsible for ensuring that 
this sub-tree provides a way of protecting KDC attributes so that 
only trusted identities can add, modify, or delete KDC attributes 
in an entry residing under the sub-tree.

* Any identity that adds a reference to an entry with policy 
information is responsible for ensuring that this entry protects 
KDC policy attributes so that only trusted identities can add, 
modify, or delete these attributes. 

* The identity that creates the realm entry is responsible for 
protecting this entry so that only trusted identities can modify, 
delete, or add attributes in the entry; only trusted identities 
can rename or delete the entry; and only trusted identities can 
insert new entries under the entry.  (The master key is inserted 
under the realm entry, so any identity that has permission to 
insert entries under the realm entry has permission to create a 
master key entry.)

* The identity that creates the master key entry is responsible 
for:

     - protecting this entry so that only trusted identities can 
modify, delete, or insert new attributes in the entry; only 
trusted identities can rename or delete the entry; and only a KDC 
service can read attributes in the entry. 

     - encrypting the master key stored in krbKeyValue if this 
attribute is used to store the master key.

* The identity that creates a KrbKey entry is responsible for:

     - protecting this entry so that only trusted identities can 
modify, delete, or insert attributes in this entry; only trusted 
identities can rename this entry; only trusted identities and the 
associated principal can delete this entry; and only a KDC 
service can read attributes from this entry.

     - storing the value in krbKeyValue as a key encrypted with a 
master key, as described previously in this document. 

* The identity that creates the KrbLog entry is responsible for 
protecting this entry so that only a KDC service in the realm can 
modify, delete, and insert attributes in this entry; and only a 
KDC service or a trusted identity in the realm can delete or 
rename this entry.

* The KDC is responsible for the following:

     - ensuring that all KDC attributes are transmitted securely 
to and from LDAP.  If attributes must be transmitted over the 
network, they must be transmitted using a security protocol with 
client and server authentication, data integrity, and, if the 
attribute contains key data, encryption that is as strong or 
stronger than DES.

     - ensuring that the KrbKey entry was created by an identity 
that is trusted in the realm before getting the attributes from 
this entry.

     - ensuring that the KrbLog entry was created by a KDC 
service in the realm before getting the attributes from this 
entry. 

* The LDAP administrator is responsible for the following:

     - If any principal entries in the realm are configured to 
store secret keys in the userPassword attribute, ensuring that 
LDAP is configured to encrypt and hash any data stored in this 
attribute using algorithms that are as strong or stronger than 
the algorithms used by Kerberos.  If the value in userPassword is 
hashed, this must be supported by the Kerberos client interfaces 
as well as the KDC.

     - Ensuring that the LDAP server and the LDAP backing 
database provides a way of auditing all additions, deletions, and 
modifications of attributes.

     - If the LDAP backing database is separate from the LDAP 
server, ensuring that all data transmitted over the network 
between the LDAP server and the backing database is transmitted 
using a security protocol with client and server authentication, 
and data integrity, and that all attributes stored in the LDAP 
backing database are protected.
