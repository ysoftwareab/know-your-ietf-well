1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

INTERNET-DRAFT      DOCSIS Subscriber Management MIB      September 2004

3. Overview

   This MIB module provides a set of objects required for the management
   of DOCSIS Cable Modem Termination Systems (CMTS). The specification
   is derived in part from the operational model described in the DOCSIS
   Radio Frequency Interface Specification [ITU-T-J122]. These managed
   objects facilitate protection of the cable network from misuse by
   subscribers. Such misuse might include, for example, address
   spoofing, service spoofing, or operation of unauthorized services.

   The following figure illustrates the operational and physical
   deployment relationships between elements in a cable modem network.
   This MIB module resides at the CMTS, which is the first point in the
   public data network at which the cable operator controls physical
   access. The CMTS (possibly assisted by other IP services devices)
   acts as a network edge, separating the physical outside-plant cable
   television network from the operator's IP network.

                 | CMTS |          operator's cable head-end
                 +------+          ---------------------

           |        |        |     subscriber host or network


   This MIB module controls IP packet forwarding to and from each cable
   modem, at the CMTS. Different modems may be accorded different
   treatment.

   Much of this module duplicates capabilities found in the DOCSIS Cable
   Device MIB [RFC2669]. While it is expected that the Cable Device MIB
   will be used to prevent unwanted traffic from entering the cable
   network, it is also possible that a malicious user might tamper with
   cable modem software, disabling its filtering policies. This MIB
   provides a more secure mechanism, since physical access to the CMTS
   is controlled by the network operator.

   In particular, this MIB provides two capabilities: first, to limit
   the IP addresses behind a modem, and, second, to provide address and
   protocol filtering to and from a modem. The first duplicates the
   capabilities of the docsDevCpe group [RFC2669]. This provides for
   either learned or provisioned subscriber premises host IP addresses
   behind a cable modem.

   The address and protocol filtering capability is similar to that
   performed by the cable modem itself. It differs in several respects,

INTERNET-DRAFT      DOCSIS Subscriber Management MIB      September 2004

   since it is intended to control subscriber traffic at the CMTS,
   rather than at the individual CM. First, the MIB structure must be
   indexed appropriately at the CMTS to indicate which cable modem
   subscriber is intended. Second, rather than maintaining a separate
   list of filters for each modem at the CMTS, it is assumed that large
   numbers of modems will share filtering characteristics. Therefore,
   modems are grouped so as to share common filter lists.

   The filtering capability is implemented using the Classification,
   Counting, and Drop facilities of the Differentiated Services MIB
   [RFC3289]. In order to provide different filtering for various
   classes of subscribers, this MIB defines the
   docsSubMgtFilterGroupTable which specifies which filters apply to
   each subscriber packet.  This table is used by RFC3289 as a first
   pass of classification, to then choose a second pass of
   classification using the diffServMultiFieldClfrTable:

   diffServDataPathStart --> diffServClfrEntry(1)
   diffServClfrElementSpecific(1) --> docsSubMgtFilterGroupIndex
   diffServClfrElementNext(1) --> diffServClfrEntry(2)
   diffServClfrElementSpecific(2)--> diffServMultiFieldClfrEntry
   diffServClfrElementNext(2) --> difServActionEntry (count or algDrop)

   Because it is assumed that large numbers of modems will share
   filtering characteristics, DOCSIS signaling defines filter groups by
   which cable modems share common filter lists. The operator creates
   references to these groups in the diffServClfrElementSpecific(1)
   entries above.

3.1. Structure of the MIB

   This MIB is structured in four tables:

   o    The docsSubMgtCpeControlTable controls the acceptance of
        subscriber host addresses behind a cable modem.

   o    The docsSubMgtCpeIpTable monitors the subscriber host addresses
        which the CMTS believes to exist behind the cable modem.

   o    The docsSubMgtCmFilterTable binds a cable modem to a set of
        filters in diffServMultiFieldClfrTable.

   o    The docsSubMgtFilterGroupTable provides the OIDs by which
        the diffServClfrElementTable selects a filter group.

   The docsSubMgtCpeControlTable and docsSubMgtCmFilterTable AUGMENT the
   docsIfCmtsCmStatusTable from [RFC2670]. Similarly,
   docsSubMgtCpeIpTable expands this table (an additional index is
   used). As such, each entry in these tables is bound to a registered
   cable modem, as perceived by the CMTS.

3.1.1. docsSubMgtFilterGroupTable

INTERNET-DRAFT      DOCSIS Subscriber Management MIB      September 2004

   The docsSubMgtFilterGroupTable links the filter group (signaled by
   DOCSIS as a small integer) to the diffServClfrElementEntry for the
   first pass of filter classification. diffServClfrElementSpecific
   requires a RowPointer. Thus, this table exists to provide referenced
   objects for diffServClfrElementSpecific. The classification method
   is:

   o  Use the DOCSIS filter group, as inferred from the sending or
      receiving modem, as the classification criterion.

   o  Use docsSubMgtFilterGroupIndex as the value to match.

   An entry exists in this Table if a reference to it exists in
   diffServClfrElementSpecific.

   As such, contrary to common practice, the index for the table is
   read-only, and is both the Entry's index and its only value.

3.1.2. IPv4 Compliance

   Please note that the compliance statements in this version of the MIB
   module require support only for IPv4 addresses.  That is because they
   current version of the DOCSIS protocols (1.0, 1.1, and 2.0) are not
   IPv6-capable.  Although support for IPv6 will require changes to the
   DOCSIS protocols, it is expected that the only changes needed to the
   MIB module itself will be the addition of new compliance statements
   that mandate support for IPv6 addresses. All IP addresses that appear
   in this document conform to the textual conventions specified in
   [RFC3291].

3.2. Management requirements

   The DOCSIS cable modem provisioning model [ITU-T-J122] requires that
   cable modems use TFTP to acquire a list of parameters. The modem then
   passes many of these parameters to the CMTS in the DOCSIS
   Registration message. The parameter values are digitally signed by
   the creator of the TFTP contents, and the signature is verified by
   the CMTS. In general, then, the CMTS need not itself be configured
   with the attributes of its cable modems. It will acquire these values
   through the Registration process that is secured by the digital
   signature.

   Cable modem subscriber management, as described here, modifies this
   process slightly for reasons of data reduction and ease of
   administrative control.  Filtering criteria, for example, are
   maintained through SNMP at the CMTS, and the modem registration
   merely signals the index values for the rows that apply to that
   modem.

3.2.1. Interaction with DOCSIS provisioning for CPE address control

   Rows in docsSubMgtCpeControlTable are created by the CMTS for each
   modem as a result of the DOCSIS registration process. The DOCSIS

   registration attributes may include items semantically equivalent to
   those in the docsDevCpe section of the DOCSIS Cable Device MIB
   [RFC2669]:

   o    docsDevCpeEnroll
   o    docsDevCpeIpMax
   o    docsDevCpeIp

       -- ***********************************************************
       -- * Note to RFC Editor (to be removed)
       -- * If DOCSIS Cable Device MIB [RFC2669] is updated prior to
       -- * this publication, replace "docsDevCpeIp" with
       -- * "docsDevCpeInetAddr"
       -- ***********************************************************

   Successful DOCSIS registration shall have the effect of setting the
   corresponding fields in the docsSubMgtCpeControlTable and the
   docsSubMgtCpeIpTable. If not present at modem registration, the CMTS
   shall apply:

   o  docsSubMgtCpeControlActive  <-- docsSubMgtCpeActiveDefault
   o  docsSubMgtCpeControlMaxCpeIp <-- docsSubMgtCpeMaxIpDefault
   o  docsSubMgtCpeControlLearnable <-- docsSubMgtCpeLearnableDefault

   Rows in docsSubMgtCpeIpTable are created through any of three ways:
   DOCSIS registration (as described above), learning by the CMTS, or
   through some unspecified administrative mechanism on the CMTS. The
   docsDevCpeIpMax table bound applies only to the first two.

   The CMTS may learn addresses by simply snooping source IP addresses
   from traffic originating from each cable modem. Other learning
   mechanisms (for example, ARP snooping) may be used. The learning
   mechanism is not defined by this document.

3.2.2. Interaction with DOCSIS provisioning for filtering

   Rows in docsSubMgtCmFilterTable are created by the CMTS for each
   modem as a result of the DOCSIS registration process. The DOCSIS
   registration attributes may include four indices (see section
   C.1.1.18.3 of [ITU-T-J122]):

   o   one identifying the upstream (ingress with respect to the CMTS
       interface) filter group for packets originating from the cable
       modem (i.e., those packets whose source MAC address matches that
       of the cable modem).
   o   one identifying the upstream filter group for packets
       originating from subscribers attached to the cable modem (i.e.,
       those packets whose source MAC address does not match that of
       the cable modem).
   o   one identifying the downstream (egress with respect to the CMTS
       interface) filter group for packets destined to the cable modem
       (i.e., those packets whose destination MAC address matches that
       of the cable modem).

INTERNET-DRAFT      DOCSIS Subscriber Management MIB      September 2004

   o   one identifying the downstream filter group for packets
       destined to subscribers attached to the cable modem (i.e.,
       those packets whose destination MAC address does not match
       that of the cable modem).

   Successful registration shall have the effect of setting
   docsSubMgtCmFilterCmDownstream, docsSubMgtCmFilterCmUpstream,
   docsSubMgtCmFilterSubDownstream, and docsSubMgtCmFilterSubUpstream,
   for that modem (just as if set through the SNMP protocol). If the
   DOCSIS attributes are not present, the four values are set to zero.
   The effect shall be to use the default entry
   (diffServClfrElementSpecific=zeroDotZero) specified in the
   diffServClfrElementTable. Note that omission of the DOCSIS-signaled
   values results in application of the default filtering entry, not
   omission of filtering.

3.2.3. Distinguishing Modem from Subscriber Traffic

   All traffic originating from or destined to a subscriber site is
   potentially suspect, and subject to suppression by the network
   operator.  This is true even if the traffic is ostensibly sourced or
   sunk by the cable modem itself, rather than the subscriber hosts
   behind the modem. To provide more nuanced administrative control,
   this document allows separate filter policies for modems and hosts.
   For example, modem policies may limit modems to server-subnet-only
   access, while allowing a different scope to subscribers.

   The CMTS chooses the filter set to apply based solely on the MAC
   address (source MAC upstream, destination MAC downstream). If the MAC
   address matches that of the modem, then the
   docsSubMgtCmFilterCmUp/Downstream pair is used; otherwise the
   docsSubMgtCmFilterSubUp/Downstream pair is applied.

   If the CM acts as a router rather than as a DOCSIS bridging
   forwarder, then the network operator will only use the
   docsSubMgtCmFilterCmUp/Downstream pair.

3.3. Relationship to the Differentiated Services MIB [RFC3289]

   DOCSIS CMTSs rely on the classification, counting, and drop
   facilities of the Differentiated Services MIB to screen subscriber
   packets for IP, TCP, and UDP characteristics. It is expected that any
   implementation of this MIB also include at least the following from
   RFC 3289:

   o    diffServDataPathTable
   o    diffServClfrTable
   o    diffServClfrElementTable
   o    diffServMultiFieldClfrTable
   o    diffServActionTable
   o    diffServCountActTable
   o    diffServAlgDropTable (diffServAlgDropType=alwaysDrop)

INTERNET-DRAFT      DOCSIS Subscriber Management MIB      September 2004

   The corresponding "next-free" objects are also required.

   The use of other facilities from RFC 3289 is not precluded, but is
   beyond the scope of this specification.

3.3.1. Using the Filter Group to Extend Packet Classification

   The base capability of RFC 3289 assumes that all packets on the same
   direction of the same interface will be classified by the same
   criteria. Filter Groups, introduced in this document, expand on RFC
   3289 to allow various subscribers to receive different classification
   (filtering) treatment. One way to view filter groups is as
   sub-interfaces within the physical DOCSIS channel. Another way to
   view them is as values of a field logically prepended to the packet
   prior to classification:

   [filter group][DOCSIS MAC header][IP header]...

   Of course this 'logical' field has no existence outside of the CMTS.

   The diffServClfrTable and diffServClfrElementTable are then used
   twice: the first classifiers select among filter groups, using OIDs
   from docsSubMgtFilterGroupTable. The 'next' action on matching a
   filter group is to select a diffServClfrEntry which now classifies on
   IP/TCP/UDP criteria (the diffServMultiFieldClfrTable_.  The 'next'
   action on this second match may be a 'count' (and accept), a 'drop',
   or some other feature from RFC 3289.

3.3.2. Interface Usage

   For purposes of DOCSIS subscriber management, only the DOCSIS MAC
   cable interface(s) are used. The interface appears as the index to
   diffServDataPathEntry, which is the starting point for diffserv MIB
   table traversal.

   The use of the diffserv MIB for other purposes, both on the DOCSIS
   MAC interfaces and on other network interfaces, is not precluded by
   this document.

3.4. Filtering and the Tiny Fragment Attack

   It is recommended that the implementers prevent the "tiny fragment"
   and "overlapping fragment" attacks for the TCP filtering tables in
   this MIB, as discussed in RFC 1858 [RFC1858] and RFC 3128 [RFC3128].

   Prevention of these attacks can be implemented with the following
   rules, when filtering is enabled:

   o    admit all packets with fragment offset >= 2

   o    discard all packets with fragment offset = 1, or with fragment
        offset = 0 AND fragment payload length < 16.

6. IANA Considerations

   The MIB module defined in this document uses the following IANA-
   assigned OBJECT IDENTIFIER value recorded in the SMI Numbers
   registry:

   Descriptor    OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
   ----------    -----------------------
   docsSubMgt    { mib-2 XX }

       -- ***********************************************************
       -- * Note to RFC Editor (to be removed)
       -- *  The IANA is requested to assign a value for XX under the
       -- *  mib-2 subtree and to record the assignment in the SMI
       -- *  Numbers registry. When the assignment has been made, the
       -- *  RFC Editor is asked to replace xx (here and in the MIB
       -- *  module) with the assigned value and to remove this note.

9. Security Considerations

   This MIB is intended to limit certain kinds of network behavior by
   subscriber hosts attached to cable modems, including, for example, IP
   spoofing. These limitations may be compromised, however, if the cable
   modem's identity or registration process is spoofed. The DOCSIS RFI
   and privacy specifications [ITU-T-J122] and [DOCSBPI] define a number
   of mechanisms for assuring modem identity.

   Effective network filtering of TCP traffic requires that implementors
   MUST follow the recommendations in section 3.2.6.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   Unauthorized SETs to this MIB can permit two major security problems
   with public cable network operation: IP address spoofing, and defeat
   of operator-defined packet filtering.

   The following objects, if SET maliciously, would evade controls on
   address spoofing:

       docsSubMgtCpeControlMaxCpeIp
       docsSubMgtCpeControlActive
       docsSubMgtCpeControlLearnable
       docsSubMgtCpeControlReset
       docsSubMgtCpeMaxIpDefault

INTERNET-DRAFT      DOCSIS Subscriber Management MIB      September 2004

       docsSubMgtCpeActiveDefault
       docsSubMgtCpeLearnableDefault

   The following objects could also permit packet filtering to be
   defeated:

       docsSubMgtCmFilterSubDownstream
       docsSubMgtCmFilterSubUpstream
       docsSubMgtCmFilterCmDownstream
       docsSubMgtCmFilterCmUpstream

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt
   the values of these objects when sending them over the network via
   SNMP. The most sensitive is docsSubMgtCpeIpAddr within
   docsSubMgtCpeIpTable. While docsSubMgtCpeIpTable is intended to
   control address spoofing, it includes information about the current
   subscriber address pool. This information may itself be valuable to
   would-be spoofers.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
