                    draft-ietf-netconf-rfc7895bis-05

Abstract

   This document describes a YANG library that provides information
   about the YANG modules, datastores, and datastore schemas used by a
   network management server.  Simple caching mechanisms are provided to
   allow clients to minimize retrieval of this information.  This
   version of the YANG library supports the Network Management Datastore
   Architecture by listing all datastores supported by a network
   management server and the schema that is used by each of these
   datastores.

   This document obsoletes RFC 7895.

1.  Introduction

   There is a need for a standard mechanism to expose which YANG modules
   [RFC7950], datastores and datastore schemas
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-revised-datastores] are in use by a network
   management server.

   This document defines the YANG module "ietf-yang-library" that
   provides this information.  This version of the YANG library is
   compatible with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA)
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-revised-datastores].  The previous version of the
   YANG library, defined in [RFC7895], is not compatible with the NMDA
   since it assumes that all datastores have exactly the same schema.
   This is not necessarily true in the NMDA since dynamic configuration
   datastores may have their own datastore schema.  Furthermore, the

Internet-Draft                YANG Library                 February 2018


   operational state datastore may support non-configurable YANG modules
   in addition to the YANG modules supported by conventional
   configuration datastores.

   The old YANG library definitions have been retained (for backwards
   compatibility reasons) but the definitions have been marked as
   deprecated.  For backwards compatibility, an NMDA-supporting server
   SHOULD populate the deprecated "/modules-state" tree in a backwards-
   compatible manner.  The new "/yang-library" tree would be ignored by
   legacy clients, while providing all the data needed for NMDA-aware
   clients, which would themselves ignore the "/modules-state" tree.
   The recommended approach to populate "/modules-state" is to report
   the schema for YANG modules that are configurable via conventional
   datastores and for which config false data nodes are returned via a
   NETCONF <get> operation, or equivalent.

   The YANG library information can be different on every server and it
   can change at runtime or across a server reboot.  If a server
   implements multiple network management protocols to access the
   server's datastores, then each such protocol may have its own
   conceptual instantiation of the YANG library.

   If a large number of YANG modules are utilized by a server, then the
   YANG library contents can be relatively large.  Since the YANG
   library contents changes very infrequently, it is important that
   clients be able to cache the YANG library contents and easily
   identify whether their cache is out of date.

   All NETCONF servers supporting YANG 1.1 [RFC7950] are required to
   support YANG Library (see Section 5.6.4 of RFC 7950).  NETCONF
   servers implementing the NETCONF extensions to support the NMDA
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-nmda-netconf] must implement at least the version
   of the YANG library defined in this document.  Similarly, all
   RESTCONF servers are required to support YANG Library (see Section 10
   of RFC 8040).  RESTCONF servers implementing the RESTCONF extensions
   to support the NMDA [I-D.ietf-netconf-nmda-restconf] must implement
   at least the version of the YANG library defined in this document.

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14, [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   The following terms are defined in [RFC7950]:

   o  module



Bierman, et al.          Expires August 31, 2018                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                YANG Library                 February 2018


   o  submodule

   o  data node

   This document uses the phrase "implementing a module" as defined in
   [RFC7950] Section 5.6.5.

   The following terms are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-revised-datastores]:

   o  datastore

   o  datastore schema

   o  configuration

   o  configuration datastore

   o  conventional configuration

   o  conventional configuration datastore

   o  operational state

   o  operational state datastore

   o  dynamic configuration datastore

   o  client and server

   The following terms are used within this document:

   o  YANG library: A collection of YANG modules, submodules,
      datastores, and datastore schemas used by a server.

   o  YANG library checksum: A server-generated checksum of the contents
      of the YANG library.

   Tree diagrams used in this document use the notation defined in
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-tree-diagrams].

3.  Objectives

   The following information is needed by a client application (for each
   YANG module in the library) to fully utilize the YANG data modeling
   language:

   o  name: The name of the YANG module.



Bierman, et al.          Expires August 31, 2018                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                YANG Library                 February 2018


   o  revision: Each YANG module and submodule within the library SHOULD
      have a revision.  This is derived from the most recent revision
      statement within the module or submodule.

   o  submodule list: The name, and if defined, revision of each
      submodule used by the module MUST be identified.

   o  feature list: The name of each YANG feature supported by the
      server, in a given datastore schema, MUST be identified.

   o  deviation list: The name of each YANG module with deviation
      statements affecting a given YANG module, in a given datastore
      schema, MUST be identified.

   In addition, the following information is needed by a client
   application for each datastore supported by a server:

   o  identity: The YANG identity for the datastore.

   o  schema: The schema (i.e., the set of modules) implemented by the
      datastore.

   In order to select one out of several possible data model designs,
   the following criteria were used:

   1.  Efficient for a client to consume.  Since the size of the YANG
       library can be quite large, it should be possible for clients to
       cache the YANG library information.

   2.  A dynamic configuration datastore must be able to implement a
       module or feature that is not implemented in the conventional
       configuration datastores.

   3.  It must be possible to NOT implement a module or feature in
       <operational>, even if it is implemented in some other datastore.
       This is required for transition purposes; a server that wants to
       implement <operational> should not have to implement all modules
       at once.

   4.  A given module can only be implemented in one revision in all
       datastores.  If a module is implemented in more than one
       datastores, the same revision is implemented in all these
       datastores.

   5.  Multiple revisions can be used for import, if import-by revision
       is used.

   6.  Make it possible to use the YANG library by schema mount
       [I-D.ietf-netmod-schema-mount].

4.  YANG Library Data Model

   The "ietf-yang-library" YANG module provides information about the
   modules, submodules, datastores, and datastore schemas supported by a
   server.  All data nodes in "ietf-yang-library" are "config false",
   and thus only accessible in the operational state datastore.

   +-----------+
   | datastore |
   +-----------+
        |
        | has a
        V
   +-----------+            +--------+                +------------+
   | datastore |  union of  | module |  consists of   | modules +  |
   |  schema   |----------->|  set   |--------------->| submodules |
   +-----------+            +--------+                +------------+

                                 Figure 1

   The conceptual model of the YANG library is depicted in Figure 1.
   Following the NMDA, every datastore has an associated datastore
   schema.  A datastore schema is a union of module sets and every
   module set is a collection of modules and submodules, including the
   modules and submodules used for imports.  Note that multiple
   datastores may refer to the same datastore schema.  Furthermore, it
   is possible that individual datastore schemas share module sets.  A
   common use case is the operational state datastore schema which is a
   superset of the schema used by conventional configuration datastores.

   Below is the YANG Tree Diagram for the "ietf-yang-library" module,
   excluding the deprecated "modules-state" tree:

   The "/yang-library" container holds the entire YANG library.  The
   container has the following child nodes:

   o  The "/yang-library/module-set" contains entries representing
      module sets.  The list "/yang-library/module-set/module"
      enumerates the modules that belong to the module set.  A module is
      listed together with its submodules (if any), a set of features,
      and any deviation modules.  The list "/yang-library/module-set/
      import-only-module" lists all modules (and their submodules) used
      only for imports.

Internet-Draft                YANG Library                 February 2018


   o  The "/yang-library/schema" list contains an entry for each
      datastore schema supported by the server.  All conventional
      configuration datastores use the same "schema" list entry.  A
      dynamic configuration datastore may use a different datastore
      schema from the conventional configuration datastores, and hence
      may require a separate "schema" entry.  A "schema" entry has a
      leaf-list of references to entries in the "module-set" list.  The
      schema consists of the union of all modules in all referenced
      module sets.

   o  The "/yang-library/datastore" list contains one entry for each
      datastore supported by the server, and it identifies the datastore
      schema associated with a datastore via a reference to an entry in
      the "schema" list.  Each supported conventional configuration
      datastore has a separate entry, pointing to the same "schema" list
      element.

   o  The "/yang-library/checksum" leaf contains the YANG library
      checksum, which is a unique implementation-specific identifier
      representing the current information in the YANG library on a
      specific server.  The value of this leaf MUST change whenever the
      information in the YANG library changes.  There is no requirement
      that the same information always results in the same "checksum"
      value.  This leaf allows a client to fetch all schema information
      once, cache it, and only refetch it if the value of this leaf has
      been changed.  If the value of this leaf changes, the server also
      generates a "yang-library-update" notification.

   Note that for a NETCONF server implementing the NETCONF extensions to
   support the NMDA [I-D.ietf-netconf-nmda-netconf], a change of the
   YANG library checksum results in a new value for the :yang-
   library:1.1 capability defined in [I-D.ietf-netconf-nmda-netconf].
   Thus, if such a server implements NETCONF notifications [RFC5277],
   and the notification "netconf-capability-change" [RFC6470], a
   "netconf-capability-change" notification is generated whenever the
   YANG library checksum changes.

5.  YANG Library YANG Module

   The "ietf-yang-library" YANG module imports definitions from
   "ietf-yang-types" and "ietf-inet-types" defined in [RFC6991] and from
   "ietf-datastores" defined in [I-D.ietf-netmod-revised-datastores].
   While the YANG module is defined using YANG version 1.1, the YANG
   library supports the YANG modules written in any version of YANG.

6.  IANA Considerations

   RFC 7895 previously registered one URI in the IETF XML registry
   [RFC3688].  This document takes over this registration entry made by
   RFC 7895 and changes the Registrant to the IESG according to
   Section 4 in [RFC3688].

     URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-yang-library

     Registrant Contact: The IESG.

     XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   RFC 7895 previously registered one YANG module in the "YANG Module
   Names" registry [RFC6020] as follows:

     name:         ietf-yang-library
     namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-yang-library
     prefix:       yanglib
     reference:    RFC 7895

   This document takes over this registration entry made by RFC 7895.

7.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is accessed by network management protocols such as NETCONF
   [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the
   secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC5246].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC6536] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   The "/yang-library" subtree of the YANG library may help an attacker
   identify the server capabilities and server implementations with
   known bugs since the set of YANG modules supported by a server may
   reveal the kind of device and the manufacturer of the device.

   Although some of this information may be available to all NETCONF
   users via the NETCONF <hello> message (or similar messages in other
   management protocols), this YANG module potentially exposes
   additional details that could be of some assistance to an attacker.
   Server vulnerabilities may be specific to particular modules, module
   revisions, module features, or even module deviations.  For example,
   if a particular operation on a particular data node is known to cause
   a server to crash or significantly degrade device performance, then
   the module list information will help an attacker identify server
   implementations with such a defect, in order to launch a denial-of-
   service attack on the device.

Appendix A.  Summary of Changes from RFC 7895

   This document updates [RFC7895] in the following ways:

   o  Renamed document title from "YANG Module Library" to "YANG
      Library".

   o  Added a new top-level "/yang-library" container to hold the entire
      YANG library providing information about module sets, schemas, and
      datastores.

   o  Refactored the "/modules-state" container into a new
      "/yang-library/module-set" list.

   o  Added a new "/yang-library/schema" list and a new "/yang-library/
      datastore" list.

   o  Added a set of new groupings as replacements for the deprecated
      groupings.

   o  Added a "yang-library-update" notification as a replacement for
      the deprecated "yang-library-change" notification.

   o  Deprecated the "/modules-state" tree.

   o  Deprecated the "/module-list" grouping.

   o  Deprecated the "/yang-library-change" notification.

Appendix B.  Example YANG Library Instance for a Basic Server

   The following example shows the YANG Library of a basic server
   implementing the "ietf-interfaces" [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc7223bis] and
   "ietf-ip" [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc7277bis] modules in the <running>,
   <startup>, and <operational> datastores and the "ietf-hardware"
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-entity] module in the <operational> datastore.

   Newlines in leaf values are added for formatting reasons.

Appendix C.  Example YANG Library Instance for an Advanced Server

   The following example extends the preceding Basic Server YANG Library
   example, by using modules from [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8022bis] and
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo], to illustrate a slightly more
   advanced server that:

   o  Has a module with features only enabled in <operational>; the
      "ietf-routing module" is supported in <running>, <startup>, and
      <operational>, but the "multiple-ribs" and "router-id" features




Bierman, et al.          Expires August 31, 2018               [Page 27]

Internet-Draft                YANG Library                 February 2018


      are only enabled in <operational>.  Hence the "router-id" leaf may
      be read but not configured.

   o  Supports a dynamic configuration datastore "example-ds-ephemeral",
      with only the "ietf-network" and "ietf-network-topology" modules
      configurable via a notional dynamic configuration protocol.

   o  Shows an example of datastore specific deviations.  The module
      "example-vendor-hardware-deviations" is included in the schema for
      <operational> to remove data nodes that cannot be supported by the
      server.

   o  Shows how module-sets can be used to organize related modules
      together.
