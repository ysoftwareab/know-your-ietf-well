1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG data model that can be used to configure
   and manage Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) [RFC5880].  BFD
   is a network protocol which is used for liveness detection of
   arbitrary paths between systems.  Some examples of different types of
   paths over which we have BFD:

   1) Two systems directly connected via IP.  This is known as BFD over
   single-hop IP, a.k.a.  BFD for IPv4 and IPv6 [RFC5881]

   2) Two systems connected via multiple hops as described in BFD for
   Multiple Hops.  [RFC5883]

   3) Two systems connected via MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) as
   described in BFD for MPLS LSP [RFC5884]

   4) Two systems connected via a Link Aggregation Group (LAG) interface
   as described in BFD on LAG Interfaces [RFC7130]

   5) Two systems connected via pseudowires (PWs), this is known as
   Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV) as described in BFD
   for PW VCCV [RFC5885].  This is not addressed in this document.

   BFD typically does not operate on its own.  Various control
   protocols, also known as BFD clients, use the services provided by

Internet-Draft                  BFD YANG                    January 2018


   BFD for their own operation as described in Generic Application of
   BFD [RFC5882].  The obvious candidates which use BFD are those which
   do not have "hellos" to detect failures, e.g. static routes, and
   routing protocols whose "hellos" do not support sub-second failure
   detection, e.g.  OSPF and IS-IS.

2.  Design of the Data Model

   Since BFD is used for liveliness detection of various forwarding
   paths, there is no uniform key to identify a BFD session.  So the BFD
   data model is split in multiple YANG modules where each module
   corresponds to one type of forwarding path.  For example, BFD for IP
   single-hop is in one YANG module and BFD for MPLS-TE is in another
   YANG module.  The main difference between these modules is how a BFD
   session is uniquely identified, i.e the key for the list containing
   the BFD sessions for that forwarding path.  To avoid duplication of
   BFD definitions, we have common types and groupings which are used by
   all the modules.

   A new control-plane protocol "bfdv1" is defined and a "bfd" container
   is created under control-plane-protocol as specified in A YANG Data
   Model for Routing Management [RFC8022].  This new "bfd" node is
   augmented by all the YANG modules for their respective specific
   information.

   BFD can operate in the following contexts:

   1.  Network devices as described in Network Device YANG
       Organizational Models [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-device-model]

   2.  Logical Network Elements as described in YANG Logical Network
       Element [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-lne-model]

   3.  Network instances as described in YANG Logical Network Element
       [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-ni-model]

   The approach taken is to do a schema-mount (see Schema Mount
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-schema-mount]) of the BFD model in the appropriate
   locations.  For example, if an implementation supports BFD IP multi-
   hop in network instances, the implementation would do schema-mount of
   the BFD IP multi-hop model in a mount-point which resides in a
   network instance.

   The data models in this document strive to follow the "Network
   Management Datastore Architecture" (NMDA) guidelines described in
   [I-D.dsdt-nmda-guidelines].  This means that the data models do NOT
   have separate top-level or sibling containers for configuration and
   operational data.

Internet-Draft                  BFD YANG                    January 2018


2.1.  Design of Configuration Model

   The configuration model consists mainly of the parameters specified
   in BFD [RFC5880].  Some examples are desired minimum transmit
   interval, required minimum receive interval, detection multiplier,
   etc

   BFD clients are applications that use BFD for fast detection of
   failures.  Some implementations have BFD session configuration under
   the BFD clients.  For example, BFD session configuration under
   routing applications such as OSPF, IS-IS, BGP etc.  Other
   implementations have BFD session configuration centralized under BFD,
   i.e. outside the multiple BFD clients.

   The BFD parameters of interest to a BFD client are mainly the
   multiplier and interval(s) since those parameters impact the
   convergence time of the BFD clients when a failure occurs.  Other
   parameters such as BFD authentication are not specific to the
   requirements of the BFD client.  Ideally all configuration should be
   centralized under BFD.  However, this is a problem for clients of BFD
   which auto-discover their peers.  For example, IGPs do not have the
   peer address configured, instead the IGP is enabled on an interface
   and the IGP peers are auto-discovered.  So for an operator to
   configure BFD to an IGP peer, the operator would first have to
   determine the peer addresses.  And when a new peer is discovered, BFD
   configuration would need to be added.  To avoid this issue, we define
   grouping client-cfg-parms in Section 2.13 for BFD clients to
   configure BFD: this allows BFD clients such as the IGPs to have
   configuration (multiplier and intervals) for the BFD sessions they
   need.  The mechanism how the BFD sessions are created by the BFD
   clients is outside the scope of this document.  For BFD clients which
   create BFD sessions via their own configuration, authentication
   parameters (if required) are still specified in BFD.

2.1.1.  Common BFD configuration parameters

   The basic BFD configuration parameters are:

   local-multiplier
           This is the detection time multiplier as defined in BFD
           [RFC5880].

   desired-min-tx-interval
           This is the Desired Min TX Interval as defined in BFD
           [RFC5880].

   required-min-rx-interval




Rahman, et al.            Expires July 15, 2018                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                  BFD YANG                    January 2018


           This is the Required Min RX Interval as defined in BFD
           [RFC5880].

   Although BFD [RFC5880] allows for different values for transmit and
   receive intervals, some implementations allow users to specify just
   one interval which is used for both transmit and receive intervals or
   separate values for transmit and receive intervals.  The BFD YANG
   model supports this: there is a choice between "min-interval", used
   for both transmit and receive intervals, and "desired-min-tx-
   interval" and "required-min-rx-interval".  This is supported via a
   grouping which is used by the YANG modules for the various forwarding
   paths.

   For BFD authentication we have:

   key-chain
           This is a reference to key-chain defined in YANG Data Model
           for Key Chains [RFC8177].  The keys, cryptographic
           algorithms, key lifetime etc are all defined in the key-chain
           model.

   meticulous
           This enables meticulous mode as per BFD [RFC5880].

2.1.2.  Single-hop IP

   For single-hop IP, there is an augment of the "bfd" data node in
   Section 2.  The "ip-sh" node contains a list of IP single-hop
   sessions where each session is uniquely identified by the interface
   and destination address pair.  For the configuration parameters we
   use what is defined in Section 2.1.1.  The "ip-sh" node also contains
   a list of interfaces, this is used to specify authentication
   parameters for BFD sessions which are created by BFD clients, see
   Section 2.1.

   [RFC5880] and [RFC5881] do not specify whether echo function is
   continuous or on demand.  Therefore the mechanism used to start and
   stop echo function is implementation specific and should be done by
   augmentation:

      1) Configuration.  This is suitable for continuous echo function.
      An example is provided in Appendix A.

      2) RPC.  This is suitable for on-demand echo function.

Internet-Draft                  BFD YANG                    January 2018


2.1.3.  Multi-hop IP

   For multi-hop IP, there is an augment of the "bfd" data node in
   Section 2.

   Because of multiple paths, there could be multiple multi-hop IP
   sessions between a source and a destination address.  We identify
   this as a "session-group".  The key for each "session-group" consists
   of:

   source address
           Address belonging to the local system as per BFD for Multiple
           Hops [RFC5883]

   destination address
           Address belonging to the remote system as per BFD for
           Multiple Hops [RFC5883]

   For the configuration parameters we use what is defined in
   Section 2.1.1

   Here are some extra parameters:

   tx-ttl
           TTL of outgoing BFD control packets.

   rx-ttl
           Minimum TTL of incoming BFD control packets.

2.1.4.  MPLS Traffic Engineering Tunnels

   For MPLS-TE tunnels, BFD is configured under the MPLS-TE tunnel since
   the desired failure detection parameters is a property of the MPLS-TE
   tunnel.  This is achieved by augmenting the MPLS-TE data model in
   YANG Data Model for TE Topologies [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te].  For BFD
   parameters which are specific to the TE application, e.g. whether to
   tear down the tunnel in the event of a BFD session failure, these
   parameters will be defined in the YANG model of the MPLS-TE
   application.

   On top of the usual BFD parameters, we have the following per MPLS-TE
   tunnel:

   encap
           Encapsulation for the BFD packets: choice between IP, G-ACh
           and IP with G-ACh as per MPLS Generic Associated Channel
           [RFC5586]

Internet-Draft                  BFD YANG                    January 2018


   For general MPLS-TE data, "mpls-te" data node is added under the
   "bfd" node in Section 2.  Since some MPLS-TE tunnels are uni-
   directional there is no MPLS-TE configuration for these tunnels on
   the egress node (note that this does not apply to bi-directional
   MPLS-TP tunnels).  The BFD parameters for the egress node are added
   under "mpls-te".

2.1.5.  MPLS Label Switched Paths

   Here we address MPLS LSPs whose FEC is an IP address.  The "bfd" node
   in Section 2 is augmented with "mpls" which contains a list of
   sessions uniquely identified by an IP prefix.  Because of multiple
   paths, there could be multiple MPLS sessions to an MPLS FEC.  We
   identify this as a "session-group".

   Since these LSPs are uni-directional there is no LSP configuration on
   the egress node.

   The BFD parameters for the egress node are added under "mpls".

2.1.6.  Link Aggregation Groups

   Per BFD on LAG Interfaces [RFC7130], configuring BFD on LAG consists
   of having micro-BFD sessions on each LAG member link.  Since the BFD
   parameters are an attribute of the LAG, they should be under the LAG.
   However there is no LAG YANG model which we can augment.  So a "lag"
   data node is added to the "bfd" node in Section 2, the configuration
   is per-LAG: we have a list of LAGs.  The destination IP address of
   the micro-BFD sessions is configured per-LAG and per address-family
   (IPv4 and IPv6)

2.2.  Design of Operational Model

   The operational model contains both the overall statistics of BFD
   sessions running on the device and the per session operational
   information.

   The overall statistics of BFD sessions consist of number of BFD
   sessions, number of BFD sessions up etc.  This information is
   available globally (i.e. for all BFD sessions) under the "bfd" node
   in Section 2 and also per type of forwarding path.

   For each BFD session, mainly three categories of operational items
   are shown.  The fundamental information of a BFD session such as the
   local discriminator, remote discriminator and the capability of
   supporting demand detect mode are shown in the first category.  The
   second category includes a BFD session running information, e.g. the
   remote BFD state and the diagnostic code received.  Another example

Internet-Draft                  BFD YANG                    January 2018


   is the actual transmit interval between the control packets, which
   may be different from the desired minimum transmit interval
   configured, is shown in this category.  Similar examples are actual
   received interval between the control packets and the actual transmit
   interval between the echo packets.  The third category contains the
   detailed statistics of the session, e.g. when the session
   transitioned up/down and how long it has been in that state.

   For some path types, there may be more than 1 session on the virtual
   path to the destination.  For example, with IP multi-hop and MPLS
   LSPs, there could be multiple BFD sessions from the source to the
   same destination to test the various paths (ECMP) to the destination.
   This is represented by having multiple "sessions" under each
   "session-group".

2.3.  Notifications

   This YANG model defines notifications to inform clients of BFD of
   important events detected during the protocol operation.  Pair of
   local and remote discriminator identifies a BFD session on local
   system.  Notifications also give more important details about BFD
   sessions; e.g. new state, time in previous state, network-instance
   and the reason that the BFD session state changed.  The notifications
   are defined for each type of forwarding path but use groupings for
   common information.

2.4.  RPC Operations

   None.

2.5.  BFD top level hierarchy

   At the "bfd" node under control-plane-protocol, there is no
   configuration data, only operational data.  The operational data
   consist of overall BFD session statistics, i.e. for BFD on all types
   of forwarding paths.  The "bfd" node under control-plane-protocol can
   be used in a network device (top-level), or mounted in an LNE or in a
   network instance.

2.6.  BFD IP single-hop hierarchy

   An "ip-sh" node is added under "bfd" node in control-plane-protocol.
   The configuration and operational data for each BFD IP single-hop
   session is under this "ip-sh" node.  The "ip-sh" node can be used in
   a network device (top-level), or mounted in an LNE or in a network
   instance.

2.9.  BFD over MPLS LSPs hierarchy

   An "mpls" node is added under the "bfd" node in control-plane-
   protocol.  The configuration is per MPLS FEC under this "mpls" node.
   In the operational model we support multiple BFD sessions per MPLS
   FEC (ECMP), the local discriminator is used as key.  The "mpls" node
   can be used in a network device (top-level), or mounted in an LNE or
   in a network instance.

2.11.  Interaction with other YANG modules

   Generic YANG Data Model for Connectionless OAM protocols
   [I-D.ietf-lime-yang-connectionless-oam] describes how the LIME
   connectionless OAM model could be extended to support BFD.

   Also, the operation of the BFD data model depends on configuration
   parameters that are defined in other YANG modules.

2.11.1.  Module ietf-interfaces

   The following boolean configuration is defined in A YANG Data Model
   for Interface Management [RFC7223]:

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/if:enabled
           If this configuration is set to "false", no BFD packets can
           be transmitted or received on that interface.

2.11.2.  Module ietf-ip

   The following boolean configuration is defined in A YANG Data Model
   for IP Management [RFC7277]:

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv4/ip:enabled
           If this configuration is set to "false", no BFD IPv4 packets
           can be transmitted or received on that interface.

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv4/ip:forwarding
           If this configuration is set to "false", no BFD IPv4 packets
           can be transmitted or received on that interface.

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv6/ip:enabled
           If this configuration is set to "false", no BFD IPv6 packets
           can be transmitted or received on that interface.

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv6/ip:forwarding
           If this configuration is set to "false", no BFD IPv6 packets
           can be transmitted or received on that interface.

2.11.3.  Module ietf-mpls

   The following boolean configuration is defined in A YANG Data Model
   for MPLS Base [I-D.ietf-mpls-base-yang]:

   /rt:routing/mpls:mpls/mpls:interface/mpls:config/mpls:enabled
           If this configuration is set to "false", no BFD MPLS packets
           can be transmitted or received on that interface.

2.11.4.  Module ietf-te

   The following configuration is defined in the "ietf-te" YANG module
   YANG Data Model for TE Topology [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te]:

   /ietf-te:te/ietf-te:tunnels/ietf-te:tunnel/ietf-te:config/ietf-
   te:admin-status
           If this configuration is not set to "state-up", no BFD MPLS
           packets can be transmitted or received on that tunnel.

2.20.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this memo is designed to be accessed via
   the NETCONF protocol [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the
   secure transport layer and the mandatory to implement secure
   transport is SSH [RFC6242].  The NETCONF access control model
   [RFC6536] provides the means to restrict access for particular
   NETCONF users to a pre-configured subset of all available NETCONF
   protocol operations and content.

   The YANG module has writeable data nodes which can be used for
   creation of BFD sessions and modification of BFD session parameters.
   The system should "police" creation of BFD sessions to prevent new
   sessions from causing existing BFD sessions to fail.  For BFD session
   modification, the BFD protocol has mechanisms in place which allow
   for in service modification.

2.21.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to as assign a new namespace URI from the IETF
   XML registry.

   This document registers the following namesace URIs in the IETF XML
   registry [RFC3688]:

   --------------------------------------------------------------------

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-bfd

   Registrant Contact: The IESG.

   XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

Appendix A.  Echo function configuration example

   The following intervals are added for the echo function (if
   supported):

   desired-min-echo-tx-interval
           This is the minimum interval that the local system would like
           to use when transmitting BFD echo packets.  If 0, the echo
           function as defined in BFD [RFC5880] is disabled.

   required-min-echo-rx-interval
