Abstract

   This memo defines the profile of the MIME Content-Type [MIME-DIR] for
   directory information for a white-pages person object, based on a
   vCard electronic business card. The profile definition is independent
   of any particular directory service or protocol. The profile is
   defined for representing and exchanging a variety of information
   about an individual (e.g., formatted and structured name and delivery
   addresses, email address, multiple telephone numbers, photograph,
   logo, audio clips, etc.). The directory information used by this
   profile is based on the attributes for the person object defined in
   the X.520 and X.521 directory services recommendations. The profile
   also provides the method for including a [VCARD] representation of a
   white-pages directory entry within the MIME Content-Type defined by
   the [MIME-DIR] document.

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot; and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].

Overview

   The [MIME-DIR] document defines a MIME Content-Type for holding
   different kinds of directory information. The directory information
   can be based on any of a number of directory schemas. This document
   defines a [MIME-DIR] usage profile for conveying directory
   information based on one such schema; that of the white-pages type of
   person object.

   The schema is based on the attributes for the person object defined
   in the X.520 and X.521 directory services recommendations. The schema
   has augmented the basic attributes defined in the X.500 series
   recommendation in order to provide for an electronic representation
   of the information commonly found on a paper business card. This
   schema was first defined in the [VCARD] document. Hence, this [MIME-
   DIR] profile is referred to as the vCard MIME Directory Profile.

   A directory entry based on this usage profile can include traditional
   directory, white-pages information such as the distinguished name
   used to uniquely identify the entry, a formatted representation of
   the name used for user-interface or presentation purposes, both the
   structured and presentation form of the delivery address, various
   telephone numbers and organizational information associated with the
   entry. In addition, traditional paper business card information such
   as an image of an organizational logo or identify photograph can be
   included in this person object.

   The vCard MIME Directory Profile also provides support for
   representing other important information about the person associated
   with the directory entry. For instance, the date of birth of the
   person; an audio clip describing the pronunciation of the name
   associated with the directory entry, or some other application of the

   digital sound; longitude and latitude geo-positioning information
   related to the person associated with the directory entry; date and
   time that the directory information was last updated; annotations
   often written on a business card; Uniform Resource Locators (URL) for
   a website; public key information. The profile also provides support
   for non-standard extensions to the schema. This provides the
   flexibility for implementations to augment the current capabilities
   of the profile in a standardized way. More information about this
   electronic business card format can be found in [VCARD].

1.  The vCard Mime Directory Profile Registration

   This profile is identified by the following [MIME-DIR] registration
   template information. Subsequent sections define the profile
   definition.

   To: ietf-mime-directory@imc.org

   Subject: Registration of text/directory MIME profile VCARD

   Profile name: VCARD

   Profile purpose: To hold person object or white-pages type of
   directory information. The person schema captured in the directory
   entries is that commonly found in an electronic business card.

   Predefined MIME Directory value specifications used: uri, date,
   date-time, float

   New value specifications: This profile places further constraints on
   the [MIME-DIR] text value specification. In addition, it adds a
   binary, phone-number, utc-offset and vcard value specifications.

   Predefined MIME Directory types used: SOURCE, NAME, PROFILE, BEGIN,
   END.

   Predefined MIME Directory parameters used: ENCODING, VALUE, CHARSET,
   LANGUAGE, CONTEXT.

   New types: FN, N, NICKNAME, PHOTO, BDAY, ADR, LABEL, TEL, EMAIL,
   MAILER, TZ, GEO, TITLE, ROLE, LOGO, AGENT, ORG, CATEGORIES, NOTE,
   PRODID, REV, SORT-STRING, SOUND, URL, UID, VERSION, CLASS, KEY

   New parameters: TYPE

   Profile special notes: The vCard object MUST contain the FN, N and
   VERSION types. The type-grouping feature of [MIME-DIR] is supported
   by this profile to group related vCard properties about a directory

   entry. For example, vCard properties describing WORK or HOME related
   characteristics can be grouped with a unique group label.

   The profile permits the use of non-standard types (i.e., those
   identified with the prefix string &quot;X-&quot;) as a flexible method for
   implementations to extend the functionality currently defined within
   this profile.

2.  MIME Directory Features

   The vCard MIME Directory Profile makes use of many of the features
   defined by [MIME-DIR]. The following sections either clarify or
   extend the content-type definition of [MIME-DIR].

2.1 Predefined Type Usage

   The vCard MIME Directory Profile uses the following predefined types
   from [MIME-DIR].

2.1.1 BEGIN and END Type

   The content entity MUST begin with the BEGIN type with a value of
   &quot;VCARD&quot;. The content entity MUST end with the END type with a value
   of &quot;VCARD&quot;.

2.1.2 NAME Type

   If the NAME type is present, then its value is the displayable,
   presentation text associated with the source for the vCard, as
   specified in the SOURCE type.

2.1.3 PROFILE Type

   If the PROFILE type is present, then its value MUST be &quot;VCARD&quot;.

2.1.4 SOURCE Type

   If the SOURCE type is present, then its value provides information
   how to find the source for the vCard.

2.2 Predefined Type Parameter Usage

   The vCard MIME Directory Profile uses the following predefined type
   parameters as defined by [MIME-DIR].

        - LANGUAGE

        - ENCODING

        - VALUE

2.3 Predefined VALUE Type Usage

   The predefined data type values specified in [MIME-DIR] MUST NOT be
   repeated in COMMA separated value lists except within the N,
   NICKNAME, ADR and CATEGORIES value types.

   The text value type defined in [MIME-DIR] is further restricted such
   that any SEMI-COLON character (ASCII decimal 59) in the value MUST be
   escaped with the BACKSLASH character (ASCII decimal 92).

2.4 Extensions To The Predefined VALUE Types

   The predefined data type values specified in [MIME-DIR] have been
   extended by the vCard profile to include a number of value types that
   are specific to this profile.

2.4.1 BINARY

   The &quot;binary&quot; value type specifies that the type value is inline,
   encoded binary data. This value type can be specified in the PHOTO,
   LOGO, SOUND, and KEY types.

   If inline encoded binary data is specified, the ENCODING type
   parameter MUST be used to specify the encoding format. The binary
   data MUST be encoded using the &quot;B&quot; encoding format. Long lines of
   encoded binary data SHOULD BE folded to 75 characters using the
   folding method defined in [MIME-DIR].

   The value type is defined by the following notation:

   binary = &lt;A &quot;B&quot; binary encoded string as defined by [RFC 2047].&gt;

2.4.2 VCARD

   The &quot;vcard&quot; value type specifies that the type value is another
   vCard. This value type can be specified in the AGENT type. The value
   type is defined by this specification. Since each of the type

   declarations with in the vcard value type are being specified within
   a text value themselves, they MUST be terminated with the backslash
   escape sequence &quot;\n&quot; or &quot;\N&quot;, instead of the normal newline character
   sequence CRLF. In addition, any COMMA character (ASCII decimal 44),
   SEMI-COLON character (ASCII decimal 59) and COLON character (ASCII
   decimal 58) MUST be escaped with the BACKSLASH character (ASCII
   decimal 92). For example, with the AGENT type a value would be
   specified as:

        AGENT:BEGIN:VCARD\nFN:Joe Friday\nTEL:+1-919-555-7878\n
         TITLE:Area Administrator\, Assistant\n EMAIL\;TYPE=INTERN\n
         ET:jfriday@host.com\nEND:VCARD\n

2.4.3 PHONE-NUMBER

   The &quot;phone-number&quot; value type specifies that the type value is a
   telephone number. This value type can be specified in the TEL type.
   The value type is a text value that has the special semantics of a
   telephone number as defined in [CCITT E.163] and [CCITT X.121].

2.4.4 UTC-OFFSET

   The &quot;utc-offset&quot; value type specifies that the type value is a signed
   offset from UTC. This value type can be specified in the TZ type.

   The value type is an offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). It
   is specified as a positive or negative difference in units of hours
   and minutes (e.g., +hh:mm). The time is specified as a 24-hour clock.
   Hour values are from 00 to 23, and minute values are from 00 to 59.
   Hour and minutes are 2-digits with high order zeroes required to
   maintain digit count. The extended format for ISO 8601 UTC offsets
   MUST be used. The extended format makes use of a colon character as a
   separator of the hour and minute text fields.

   The value is defined by the following notation:

        time-hour       = 2DIGIT        ;00-23
        time-minute     = 2DIGIT        ;00-59
        utc-offset      = (&quot;+&quot; / &quot;-&quot;) time-hour &quot;:&quot; time-minute

2.5 Structured Type Values

   Compound type values are delimited by a field delimiter, specified by
   the SEMI-COLON character (ASCII decimal 59). A SEMI-COLON in a
   component of a compound property value MUST be escaped with a
   BACKSLASH character (ASCII decimal 92).

   Lists of values are delimited by a list delimiter, specified by the
   COMMA character (ASCII decimal 44). A COMMA character in a value MUST
   be escaped with a BACKSLASH character (ASCII decimal 92).

   This profile supports the type grouping mechanism defined in [MIME-
   DIR]. Grouping of related types is a useful technique to communicate
   common semantics concerning the properties of a vCard.

2.6 Line Delimiting and Folding

   This profile supports the same line delimiting and folding methods
   defined in [MIME-DIR]. Specifically, when parsing a content line,
   folded lines must first be unfolded according to the unfolding
   procedure described in [MIME-DIR]. After generating a content line,
   lines longer than 75 characters SHOULD be folded according to the
   folding procedure described in [MIME DIR].

   Folding is done after any content encoding of a type value. Unfolding
   is done before any decoding of a type value in a content line.

3.  vCard Profile Features

   The vCard MIME Directory Profile Type contains directory information,
   typically pertaining to a single directory entry. The information is
   described using an attribute schema that is tailored for capturing
   personal contact information. The vCard can include attributes that
   describe identification, delivery addressing, telecommunications
   addressing, geographical, organizational, general explanatory and
   security and access information about the particular object
   associated with the vCard.

3.1 Identification Types

   These types are used in the vCard profile to capture information
   associated with the identification and naming of the person or
   resource associated with the vCard.

3.1.1 FN Type Definition

   To: ietf-mime-directory@imc.org

   Subject: Registration of text/directory MIME type FN

   Type name:FN

   Type purpose: To specify the formatted text corresponding to the name
   of the object the vCard represents.

   Type encoding: 8bit

   Type value: A single text value.

   Type special notes: This type is based on the semantics of the X.520
   Common Name attribute. The property MUST be present in the vCard
   object.

   Type example:

        FN:Mr. John Q. Public\, Esq.

3.1.2 N Type Definition

   To: ietf-mime-directory@imc.org

   Subject: Registration of text/directory MIME type N

   Type name: N

   Type purpose: To specify the components of the name of the object the
   vCard represents.

   Type encoding: 8bit

   Type value: A single structured text value. Each component can have
   multiple values.

   Type special note: The structured type value corresponds, in
   sequence, to the Family Name, Given Name, Additional Names, Honorific
   Prefixes, and Honorific Suffixes. The text components are separated
   by the SEMI-COLON character (ASCII decimal 59). Individual text
   components can include multiple text values (e.g., multiple
   Additional Names) separated by the COMMA character (ASCII decimal
   44). This type is based on the semantics of the X.520 individual name
   attributes. The property MUST be present in the vCard object.

   Type example:

        N:Public;John;Quinlan;Mr.;Esq.

        N:Stevenson;John;Philip,Paul;Dr.;Jr.,M.D.,A.C.P.

3.1.3 NICKNAME Type Definition

   To: ietf-mime-directory@imc.org

   Subject: Registration of text/directory MIME type NICKNAME

   Type name: NICKNAME

   Type purpose: To specify the text corresponding to the nickname of
   the object the vCard represents.

   Type encoding: 8bit

   Type value: One or more text values separated by a COMMA character
   (ASCII decimal 44).

   Type special note: The nickname is the descriptive name given instead
   of or in addition to the one belonging to a person, place, or thing.
   It can also be used to specify a familiar form of a proper name
   specified by the FN or N types.

   Type example:

        NICKNAME:Robbie

        NICKNAME:Jim,Jimmie

3.1.4 PHOTO Type Definition

   To: ietf-mime-directory@imc.org

   Subject: Registration of text/directory MIME type PHOTO

   Type name: PHOTO

   Type purpose: To specify an image or photograph information that
   annotates some aspect of the object the vCard represents.

   Type encoding: The encoding MUST be reset to &quot;b&quot; using the ENCODING
   parameter in order to specify inline, encoded binary data. If the
   value is referenced by a URI value, then the default encoding of 8bit
   is used and no explicit ENCODING parameter is needed.

   Type value: A single value. The default is binary value. It can also
   be reset to uri value. The uri value can be used to specify a value
   outside of this MIME entity.

   Type special notes: The type can include the type parameter &quot;TYPE&quot; to
   specify the graphic image format type. The TYPE parameter values MUST
   be one of the IANA registered image formats or a non-standard image
   format.

   Type example:

        PHOTO;VALUE=uri:http://www.abc.com/pub/photos
         /jqpublic.gif


        PHOTO;ENCODING=b;TYPE=JPEG:MIICajCCAdOgAwIBAgICBEUwDQYJKoZIhvcN
         AQEEBQAwdzELMAkGA1UEBhMCVVMxLDAqBgNVBAoTI05ldHNjYXBlIENvbW11bm
         ljYXRpb25zIENvcnBvcmF0aW9uMRwwGgYDVQQLExNJbmZvcm1hdGlvbiBTeXN0
         &lt;...remainder of &quot;B&quot; encoded binary data...&gt;

3.1.5 BDAY Type Definition

   To: ietf-mime-directory@imc.org

   Subject: Registration of text/directory MIME type BDAY

   Type name: BDAY

   Type purpose: To specify the birth date of the object the vCard
   represents.

   Type encoding: 8bit

   Type value: The default is a single date value. It can also be reset
   to a single date-time value.

   Type examples:

        BDAY:1996-04-15

        BDAY:1953-10-15T23:10:00Z

        BDAY:1987-09-27T08:30:00-06:00

3.2 Delivery Addressing Types

   These types are concerned with information related to the delivery
   addressing or label for the vCard object.

3.2.1 ADR Type Definition

   To: ietf-mime-directory@imc.org

   Subject: Registration of text/directory MIME type ADR

   Type name: ADR

   Type purpose: To specify the components of the delivery address for
   the vCard object.

   Type encoding: 8bit

   Type value: A single structured text value, separated by the
   SEMI-COLON character (ASCII decimal 59).

   Type special notes: The structured type value consists of a sequence
   of address components. The component values MUST be specified in
   their corresponding position. The structured type value corresponds,
   in sequence, to the post office box; the extended address; the street
   address; the locality (e.g., city); the region (e.g., state or
   province); the postal code; the country name. When a component value
   is missing, the associated component separator MUST still be
   specified.

   The text components are separated by the SEMI-COLON character (ASCII
   decimal 59). Where it makes semantic sense, individual text
   components can include multiple text values (e.g., a &quot;street&quot;
   component with multiple lines) separated by the COMMA character
   (ASCII decimal 44).

   The type can include the type parameter &quot;TYPE&quot; to specify the
   delivery address type. The TYPE parameter values can include &quot;dom&quot; to
   indicate a domestic delivery address; &quot;intl&quot; to indicate an
   international delivery address; &quot;postal&quot; to indicate a postal
   delivery address; &quot;parcel&quot; to indicate a parcel delivery address;
   &quot;home&quot; to indicate a delivery address for a residence; &quot;work&quot; to
   indicate delivery address for a place of work; and &quot;pref&quot; to indicate
   the preferred delivery address when more than one address is
   specified. These type parameter values can be specified as a
   parameter list (i.e., &quot;TYPE=dom;TYPE=postal&quot;) or as a value list
   (i.e., &quot;TYPE=dom,postal&quot;). This type is based on semantics of the
   X.520 geographical and postal addressing attributes. The default is
   &quot;TYPE=intl,postal,parcel,work&quot;. The default can be overridden to some
   other set of values by specifying one or more alternate values. For
   example, the default can be reset to &quot;TYPE=dom,postal,work,home&quot; to
   specify a domestic delivery address for postal delivery to a
   residence that is also used for work.

   Type example: In this example the post office box and the extended
   address are absent.

        ADR;TYPE=dom,home,postal,parcel:;;123 Main
          Street;Any Town;CA;91921-1234

3.2.2 LABEL Type Definition

   To: ietf-mime-directory@imc.org

   Subject: Registration of text/directory MIME type LABEL

   Type name: LABEL

   Type purpose: To specify the formatted text corresponding to delivery
   address of the object the vCard represents.

   Type encoding: 8bit

   Type value: A single text value.

   Type special notes: The type value is formatted text that can be used
   to present a delivery address label for the vCard object. The type
   can include the type parameter &quot;TYPE&quot; to specify delivery label type.
   The TYPE parameter values can include &quot;dom&quot; to indicate a domestic
   delivery label; &quot;intl&quot; to indicate an international delivery label;
   &quot;postal&quot; to indicate a postal delivery label; &quot;parcel&quot; to indicate a
   parcel delivery label; &quot;home&quot; to indicate a delivery label for a
   residence; &quot;work&quot; to indicate delivery label for a place of work; and
   &quot;pref&quot; to indicate the preferred delivery label when more than one
   label is specified. These type parameter values can be specified as a
   parameter list (i.e., &quot;TYPE=dom;TYPE=postal&quot;) or as a value list
   (i.e., &quot;TYPE=dom,postal&quot;). This type is based on semantics of the
   X.520 geographical and postal addressing attributes. The default is
   &quot;TYPE=intl,postal,parcel,work&quot;. The default can be overridden to some
   other set of values by specifying one or more alternate values. For
   example, the default can be reset to &quot;TYPE=intl,post,parcel,home&quot; to
   specify an international delivery label for both postal and parcel
   delivery to a residential location.

   Type example: A multi-line address label.

5.  Differences From vCard v2.1

   This specification has been reviewed by the IETF community. The
   review process introduced a number of differences from the [VCARD]
   version 2.1. These differences require that vCard objects conforming
   to this specification have a different version number than a vCard
   conforming to [VCARD]. The differences include the following:

        . The QUOTED-PRINTABLE inline encoding has been eliminated.
          Only the &quot;B&quot; encoding of [RFC 2047] is an allowed value for
          the ENCODING parameter.

        . The method for specifying CRLF character sequences in text
          type values has been changed. The CRLF character sequence in
          a text type value is specified with the backslash character
          sequence &quot;\n&quot; or &quot;\N&quot;.

        . Any COMMA or SEMICOLON in a text type value must be backslash
          escaped.

        . VERSION value corresponding to this specification MUST be
          &quot;3.0&quot;.

        . The [MIME-DIR] predefined types of SOURCE, NAME and PROFILE
          are allowed.

        . The [MIME-DIR] VALUE type parameter for value data typing is
          allowed. In addition, there are extensions made to these type
          values for additional value types used in this specification.

        . The [VCARD] CHARSET type parameter has been eliminated.
          Character set can only be specified on the CHARSET parameter
          on the Content-Type MIME header field.

        . The [VCARD] support for non-significant WSP character has
          been eliminated.

        . The &quot;TYPE=&quot; prefix to parameter values is required. In
          [VCARD] this was optional.

        . LOGO, PHOTO and SOUND multimedia formats MUST be either IANA
          registered types or non-standard types.

        . Inline binary content must be &quot;B&quot; encoded and folded. A blank
          line after the encoded binary content is no longer required.

        . TEL values can be identified as personal communication
          services telephone numbers with the PCS type parameter value.

        . The CATEGORIES, CLASS, NICKNAME, PRODID and SORT-STRING types
          have been added.

        . The VERSION, N and FN types MUST be specified in a vCard.
          This identifies the version of the specification that the
          object was formatted to. It also assures that every vCard
          will include both a structured and formatted name that can be
          used to identify the object.

8.  Security Considerations

   vCards can carry cryptographic keys or certificates, as described in
   Section 3.7.2.

   Section 3.7.1 specifies a desired security classification policy for
   a particular vCard. That policy is not enforced in any way.

   The vCard objects have no inherent authentication or privacy, but can
   easily be carried by any security mechanism that transfers MIME
   objects with authentication or privacy. In cases where threats of
   &quot;spoofed&quot; vCard information is a concern, the vCard SHOULD BE

   transported using one of these secure mechanisms.

   The information in a vCard may become out of date. In cases where the
   vitality of data is important to an originator of a vCard, the &quot;URL&quot;
   type described in section 3.6.8 SHOULD BE specified. In addition, the
   &quot;REV&quot; type described in section 3.6.4 can be specified to indicate
   the last time that the vCard data was updated.
