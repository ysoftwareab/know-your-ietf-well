Abstract

   The purpose of this document is to make the Advanced Encryption
   Standard (AES) Key Wrap algorithm conveniently available to the
   Internet community.  The United States of America has adopted AES as
   the new encryption standard.  The AES Key Wrap algorithm will
   probably be adopted by the USA for encryption of AES keys. The
   authors took most of the text in this document from the draft AES Key
   Wrap posted by NIST.

1. Introduction

   NOTE: Most of the following text is taken from [AES-WRAP], and the
   assertions regarding the security of the AES Key Wrap algorithm are
   made by the US Government, not by the authors of this document.

   This specification is intended to satisfy the National Institute of
   Standards and Technology (NIST) Key Wrap requirement to:  Design a
   cryptographic algorithm called a Key Wrap that uses the Advanced
   Encryption Standard (AES) as a primitive to securely encrypt
   plaintext key(s) with any associated integrity information and data,
   such that the combination could be longer than the width of the AES
   block size (128-bits).  Each ciphertext bit should be a highly non-
   linear function of each plaintext bit, and (when unwrapping) each
   plaintext bit should be a highly non-linear function of each
   ciphertext bit.  It is sufficient to approximate an ideal
   pseudorandom permutation to the degree that exploitation of
   undesirable phenomena is as unlikely as guessing the AES engine key.

   This key wrap algorithm needs to provide ample security to protect
   keys in the context of prudently designed key management
   architecture.

   Throughout this document, any data being wrapped will be referred to
   as the key data.  It makes no difference to the algorithm whether the
   data being wrapped is a key; in fact there is often good reason to
   include other data with the key, to wrap multiple keys together, or
   to wrap data that isn&#x27;t strictly a key.  So, the term &quot;key data&quot; is
   used broadly to mean any data being wrapped, but particularly keys,
   since this is primarily a key wrap algorithm.  The key used to do the
   wrapping will be referred to as the key-encryption key (KEK).

   In this document a KEK can be any valid key supported by the AES
   codebook.  That is, a KEK can be a 128-bit key, a 192-bit key, or a
   256-bit key.

2. Overview

   The AES key wrap algorithm is designed to wrap or encrypt key data.
   The key wrap operates on blocks of 64 bits.  Before being wrapped,
   the key data is parsed into n blocks of 64 bits.

   The only restriction the key wrap algorithm places on n is that n be
   at least two.  (For key data with length less than or equal to 64
   bits, the constant field used in this specification and the key data
   form a single 128-bit codebook input making this key wrap
   unnecessary.)  The key wrap algorithm accommodates all supported AES
   key sizes.  However, other cryptographic values often need to be
   wrapped.  One such value is the seed of the random number generator
   for DSS.  This seed value requires n to be greater than four.
   Undoubtedly other values require this type of protection. Therefore,
   no upper bound is imposed on n.

   The AES key wrap can be configured to use any of the three key sizes
   supported by the AES codebook.  The choice of a key size affects the
   overall security provided by the key wrap, but it does not alter the
   description of the key wrap algorithm.  Therefore, in the description
   that follows, the key wrap is described generically; no key size is
   specified for the KEK.

2.1 Notation and Definitions

   The following notation is used in the description of the key wrapping
   algorithms:

      AES(K, W)     Encrypt W using the AES codebook with key K
      AES-1(K, W)   Decrypt W using the AES codebook with key K
      MSB(j, W)     Return the most significant j bits of W
      LSB(j, W)     Return the least significant j bits of W
      B1 ^ B2       The bitwise exclusive or (XOR) of B1 and B2
      B1 | B2       Concatenate B1 and B2
      K             The key-encryption key K
      n             The number of 64-bit key data blocks
      s             The number of steps in the wrapping process, s = 6n
      P[i]          The ith plaintext key data block
      C[i]          The ith ciphertext data block
      A             The 64-bit integrity check register
      R[i]          An array of 64-bit registers where
                       i = 0, 1, 2, ..., n
      A[t], R[i][t] The contents of registers A and R[i] after encryption
                       step t.
      IV            The 64-bit initial value used during the wrapping
                       process.

   In the key wrap algorithm, the concatenation function will be used to
   concatenate 64-bit quantities to form the 128-bit input to the AES
   codebook.  The extraction functions will be used to split the 128-bit
   output from the AES codebook into two 64-bit quantities.

2.2 Algorithms

   The specification of the key wrap algorithm requires the use of the
   AES codebook [AES].  The next three sections will describe the key
   wrap algorithm, the key unwrap algorithm, and the inherent data
   integrity check.

2.2.1 Key Wrap

   The inputs to the key wrapping process are the KEK and the plaintext
   to be wrapped.  The plaintext consists of n 64-bit blocks, containing
   the key data being wrapped.  The key wrapping process is described
   below.

   Inputs:      Plaintext, n 64-bit values {P1, P2, ..., Pn}, and
                Key, K (the KEK).
   Outputs:     Ciphertext, (n+1) 64-bit values {C0, C1, ..., Cn}.

<b>Original Text:</b>

   1) Initialize variables.

       Set A0 to an initial value (see 2.2.3)
       For i = 1 to n
            R[0][i] = P[i]

<b>Corrected Text:</b>

</pre>
<b>Notes:</b><br/>

</div>
   2) Calculate intermediate values.

       For t = 1 to s, where s = 6n
           A[t] = MSB(64, AES(K, A[t-1] | R[t-1][1])) ^ t
           For i = 1 to n-1
               R[t][i] = R[t-1][i+1]
           R[t][n] = LSB(64, AES(K, A[t-1] | R[t-1][1]))

   3) Output the results.

       Set C[0] = A[t]
       For i = 1 to n
           C[i] = R[t][i]

   An alternative description of the key wrap algorithm involves
   indexing rather than shifting.  This approach allows one to calculate
   the wrapped key in place, avoiding the rotation in the previous
   description.  This produces identical results and is more easily
   implemented in software.

   Inputs:  Plaintext, n 64-bit values {P1, P2, ..., Pn}, and
            Key, K (the KEK).
   Outputs: Ciphertext, (n+1) 64-bit values {C0, C1, ..., Cn}.

   1) Initialize variables.

       Set A = IV, an initial value (see 2.2.3)
       For i = 1 to n
           R[i] = P[i]

   2) Calculate intermediate values.

       For j = 0 to 5
           For i=1 to n
               B = AES(K, A | R[i])
               A = MSB(64, B) ^ t where t = (n*j)+i
               R[i] = LSB(64, B)

   3) Output the results.

       Set C[0] = A
       For i = 1 to n
           C[i] = R[i]

2.2.2 Key Unwrap

   The inputs to the unwrap process are the KEK and (n+1) 64-bit blocks
   of ciphertext consisting of previously wrapped key.  It returns n
   blocks of plaintext consisting of the n 64-bit blocks of the
   decrypted key data.

   Inputs:  Ciphertext, (n+1) 64-bit values {C0, C1, ..., Cn}, and
           Key, K (the KEK).
   Outputs: Plaintext, n 64-bit values {P1, P2, ..., Pn}.

   1) Initialize variables.

       Set A[s] = C[0] where s = 6n
       For i = 1 to n
           R[s][i] = C[i]

   2) Calculate the intermediate values.

       For t = s to 1
           A[t-1] = MSB(64, AES-1(K, ((A[t] ^ t) | R[t][n]))
           R[t-1][1] = LSB(64, AES-1(K, ((A[t]^t) | R[t][n]))
           For i = 2 to n
               R[t-1][i] = R[t][i-1]

   3) Output the results.

       If A[0] is an appropriate initial value (see 2.2.3),
       Then
           For i = 1 to n
               P[i] = R[0][i]
       Else
           Return an error

   The unwrap algorithm can also be specified as an index based
   operation, allowing the calculations to be carried out in place.
   Again, this produces the same results as the register shifting
   approach.

   Inputs:  Ciphertext, (n+1) 64-bit values {C0, C1, ..., Cn}, and
            Key, K (the KEK).
   Outputs: Plaintext, n 64-bit values {P0, P1, K, Pn}.

   1) Initialize variables.

       Set A = C[0]
       For i = 1 to n
           R[i] = C[i]

   2) Compute intermediate values.

       For j = 5 to 0
           For i = n to 1
               B = AES-1(K, (A ^ t) | R[i]) where t = n*j+i
               A = MSB(64, B)
               R[i] = LSB(64, B)

   3) Output results.

   If A is an appropriate initial value (see 2.2.3),
   Then
       For i = 1 to n
           P[i] = R[i]
   Else
       Return an error

2.2.3 Key Data Integrity -- the Initial Value

   The initial value (IV) refers to the value assigned to A[0] in the
   first step of the wrapping process.  This value is used to obtain an
   integrity check on the key data.  In the final step of the unwrapping
   process, the recovered value of A[0] is compared to the expected

   value of A[0].  If there is a match, the key is accepted as valid,
   and the unwrapping algorithm returns it.  If there is not a match,
   then the key is rejected, and the unwrapping algorithm returns an
   error.

   The exact properties achieved by this integrity check depend on the
   definition of the initial value.  Different applications may call for
   somewhat different properties; for example, whether there is need to
   determine the integrity of key data throughout its lifecycle or just
   when it is unwrapped.  This specification defines a default initial
   value that supports integrity of the key data during the period it is
   wrapped (2.2.3.1).  Provision is also made to support alternative
   initial values (in 2.2.3.2).

2.2.3.1 Default Initial Value

   The default initial value (IV) is defined to be the hexadecimal
   constant:

       A[0] = IV = A6A6A6A6A6A6A6A6

   The use of a constant as the IV supports a strong integrity check on
   the key data during the period that it is wrapped.  If unwrapping
   produces A[0] = A6A6A6A6A6A6A6A6, then the chance that the key data
   is corrupt is 2^-64.  <span class="Verified-inline-styling" id='inline-3671'>If unwrapping produces A[0] equal to any other value,</span id__locate=3671> <button id="btn_3671" target="expand_3671" onclick='hideFunction("expand_3671")'>Expand</button>

This resembles a copy-paste typo, where the last portion of &quot;If unwrapping produces A[0]&quot; was not removed in the second of two sentences.<br/><br/>I edited this based on comments from the authors.
</div>
</div>   then the unwrap must return an error and not return any key data.

2.2.3.2 Alternative Initial Values

   When the key wrap is used as part of a larger key management protocol
   or system, the desired scope for data integrity may be more than just
   the key data or the desired duration for more than just the period
   that it is wrapped.  Also, if the key data is not just an AES key, it
   may not always be a multiple of 64 bits.  Alternative definitions of
   the initial value can be used to address such problems.  NIST will
   define alternative initial values in future key management
   publications as needed.  In order to accommodate a set of
   alternatives that may evolve over time, key wrap implementations that
   are not application-specific will require some flexibility in the way
   that the initial value is set and tested.

3. Object Identifiers

   NIST has assigned the following object identifiers to identify the
   key wrap algorithm with the default initial value specified in
   2.2.3.1.  One object identifier is assigned for use with each of the
   KEK AES key sizes.

       aes  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { joint-iso-itu-t(2) country(16)

          us(840) organization(1) gov(101) csor(3) nistAlgorithm(4) 1 }

       id-aes128-wrap  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { aes 5 }
       id-aes192-wrap  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { aes 25 }
       id-aes256-wrap  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { aes 45 }

4. Test Vectors

   The examples in this section were generated using the index-based
   implementation of the key wrap algorithm.  The use of this approach
   allows a straightforward software implementation of the key wrap
   algorithm.

5. Security Considerations

   The key wrap algorithm includes a strong integrity check on the key
   data.  If unwrapping produces the expected check value in A[0], then
   the chance that the key data is corrupt is 2^-64.  If unwrapping
   produces an unexpected value, then the algorithm implementation MUST
   return an error, and it MUST NOT return any key data.

   Implementations must protect the KEK from disclosure.  Compromise of
   the KEK may result in the disclosure of all key data protected with
   that KEK.

5. Security Considerations

   The key wrap algorithm includes a strong integrity check on the key
   data.  If unwrapping produces the expected check value in A[0], then
   the chance that the key data is corrupt is 2^-64.  If unwrapping
   produces an unexpected value, then the algorithm implementation MUST
   return an error, and it MUST NOT return any key data.

   Implementations must protect the KEK from disclosure.  Compromise of
   the KEK may result in the disclosure of all key data protected with
   that KEK.
