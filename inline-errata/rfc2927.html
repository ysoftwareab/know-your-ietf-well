Abstract

   This document defines a multipurpose internet mail extensions (MIME)
   directory profile for holding a lightweight directory access protocol
   (LDAP) schema.  It is intended for communication with the Internet
   schema listing service.

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;,  &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [4].

1. Overview

   This document defines how a MIME type may be used to transfer a
   single LDAPv3 schema definition.

   A schema for use with LDAPv3 consists of any number of object class,
   attribute type, matching rule and syntax definitions.  These concepts
   are defined in the LDAPv3 protocol definition [2].  The schema MAY
   have a numeric OID assigned to it by a schema listing or registration
   service.

   A schema may import definitions from another schema.  Schema imports
   are not, however, transitive.

   For example, a schema contains a definition for a &quot;modem&quot; object
   class, which is to be defined as a subclass of the X.521 &quot;device&quot;
   object class.  In this case, the schema MUST import the definitions
   of X.521.

2. The &quot;schema-ldap-0&quot; MIME Directory Profile Registration

   This profile is identified by the following registration template
   information.

   To: ietf-mime-direct@imc.org
   Subject: Registration of text/directory MIME profile &quot;schema-ldap-0&quot;

   Profile name: schema-ldap-0

   Profile purpose: To represent a schema defined for use with LDAPv3
   servers.

   Profile types: SOURCE, ldapSchemas, attributeTypes, matchingRules,
   objectClasses, matchingRuleUse, ldapSyntaxes

   Profile special notes:

   The charset parameter MUST be present on the MIME content, and the
   value of this parameter MUST be &quot;utf-8&quot;.  This ensures that schema
   values can be used in LDAPv3 attribute values without a character set
   translation.

   Neither the &quot;BEGIN&quot; and &quot;END&quot; types nor type grouping are used in
   contents of this profile.

   All of the types in this profile with the exception of ldapSchemas
   may be multi-valued.  Each value is present on its own contentline.
   Values may be present in any order, and need not be arranged by type.

   The &quot;SOURCE&quot; type is optional, and if values are present they SHOULD
   be URIs of the &quot;ldap&quot; form.  If the URI is of the &quot;ldap&quot; form, the
   object indicated by the URI is a subschema entry.  The use of other
   forms are reserved for future applications.

   In this version of the profile, exactly one value of the ldapSchemas
   type MUST be present.  (Later versions of the profile may permit
   multiple ldapSchemas values to be present in a content.)

   Implementors should note that there will likely be values of the
   profile types in most contents much longer than 76 bytes.  In
   addition, there may be non-ASCII characters and embedded CRLFs inside
   of values, which could require either quoting of the value or use of
   a content transfer encoding.

   If a contentline in a particular content contains a &quot;context&quot;
   parameter and the value of that parameter is not &quot;ldap&quot;, then that
   contentline SHOULD be ignored.

   Intended usage: COMMON

   This document defines all the types, with the exception of &quot;SOURCE&quot;

   ldap-0&quot; directory profile, although they may be applicable to other
   profiles defined in the future.

4. Security Considerations

   A MIME body part containing an text/directory of the schema-ldap-0
   profile may be incorporated in a digitally signed MIME content, which
   can be used to verify that the body part has not been modified in
   transit.  When the signer has been certified by a trusted third party
   service, it may also be possible to verify the origin of the content.

Appendix A

   This appendix defines two new attributes which could be present in an
   subschema entry.  These attributes could be added to a future
   revision of the LDAP attribute definition [3].

A.1. ldapSchemas attribute type definition

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.101.120.17 NAME &#x27;ldapSchemas&#x27;
        SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.56 USAGE directoryOperation )

   Each value of the ldapSchemas attribute defines one schema.  Its
   syntax, given in section A.2, contains the elements needed for an
   LDAPv3 server to correctly process operations which use the
   definitions from this syntax.

A.2. LDAP Schema Definition syntax definition

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.56 DESC &#x27;LDAP Schema Definition&#x27; )

   Values in this syntax are represented according to the following BNF:

      LdapSchema = &quot;(&quot; whsp
        numericoid whsp
        [ &quot;NAME&quot; qdescrs ]
        [ &quot;OBSOLETE&quot; whsp ]
        [ &quot;IMPORTS&quot; oids ]
        [ &quot;CLASSES&quot; oids ]
        [ &quot;ATTRIBUTES&quot; oids ]
        [ &quot;MATCHING-RULES&quot; oids ]
        [ &quot;SYNTAXES&quot; oids ]
        whsp &quot;)&quot;

   The numericoid field uniquely identifies the schema.  A new OID
   should be assigned if any of the fields of the schema change.  It is
   not possible to import definitions from a schema until an OID has
   been assigned to it.

   The &quot;NAME&quot; field contains optional human-readable labels for the
   schema.

   The &quot;OBSOLETE&quot; field is present if the schema is obsolete.

   The &quot;IMPORTS&quot; field lists the OIDs of other schemas which are to be
   incorporated by reference into this schema.  It is an error to have
   an attribute type or object class defined in a schema with the same
   name but a different OID as an attribute type or object class in an

   imported schema.  It is also an error to import from two schema
   definitions in which there are attribute types or object classes with
   the same names but different OIDs.

   The &quot;CLASSES&quot; field lists the OIDs of object classes defined in this
   schema.  A schema need not contain any object class definitions.  A
   schema must not contain two object class definitions of the same name
   but with different OIDs.

   The &quot;ATTRIBUTES&quot; field lists the OIDs of attribute types defined in
   this schema.  A schema need not contain any object class definitions.
   A schema must not contain two attribute type definitions of the same
   name but with different OIDs.

   The &quot;MATCHING-RULES&quot; field lists the OIDs of matching rules defined
   in this schema.  A schema need not contain any matching rules.

   The &quot;SYNTAXES&quot; field lists the OIDs of syntaxes defined in this
   schema. A schema need not contain any syntaxes.
