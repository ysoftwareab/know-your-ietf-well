               Registration Event Package Extension for
                   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
               Globally Routable User Agent URIs (GRUUs)

Abstract

   RFC 3680 defines a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event package
   for registration state.  This package allows a watcher to learn about
   information stored by a SIP registrar, including its registered
   contact.

   However, the registered contact is frequently unreachable and thus
   not useful for watchers.  The Globally Routable User Agent URI
   (GRUU), defined in RFC 5627, is a URI that is capable of reaching a
   particular contact.  However this URI is not included in the document
   format defined in RFC 3680.  This specification defines an extension
   to the registration event package to include GRUUs assigned by the
   registrar.

1.  Introduction

   RFC 3680 [2] defines a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [5] event
   package for registration state.  This package allows a watcher to
   learn about information stored by a SIP registrar, including the
   registered contacts.

   However, a registered contact is frequently unreachable from hosts
   outside of the domain of the User Agent (UA).  It is commonly a
   private address, or, when it is a public address, access to it may be
   blocked by firewalls.

   The Globally Routable User Agent URI (GRUU), defined in RFC 5627 [3],
   is a URI that reaches a particular UA instance, but is reachable by
   any host on the Internet.  GRUUs assigned by the registrar represent
   additional registration state.  However, GRUUs assigned by the
   registrar are not included in the notifications provided by RFC 3680.
   For many applications of the registration event package, a GRUU is
   needed, and not the registered contact.

   For example, the Welcome Notices example in [2] will only operate
   correctly if the contact address in the registration event
   notification is reachable by the sender of the welcome notice.  When
   the registering device is using the GRUU extension, it is likely that
   the registered contact address will not be globally addressable, and
   a GRUU should be used as the target address for the MESSAGE.

   Another case where this feature may be helpful is within the Third
   Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS).
   IMS employs a technique where a REGISTER of a contact address to one
   Address of Record (AOR) causes the implicit registration of the same
   contact to other associated AORs.  If GRUUs are requested and
   obtained as part of the registration request, then additional GRUUs
   will also be needed for the implicit registrations.  While assigning
   the additional GRUUs is straightforward, informing the registering UA
   of them is not.  In IMS, UAs typically subscribe to the registration
   event, and subscriptions to the registration event for an AOR result
   in notifications, each containing the registration state of all the
   associated AORs.  The proposed extension provides a way to easily
   deliver the GRUUs for the associated AORs.

   As specified in RFC 5627 [3], temporary GRUUs are invalidated when
   contact address bindings for the corresponding AOR and instance ID
   are not refreshed, or when a registration to the AOR and instance ID
   is performed with a new Call-ID.  A UA cannot always determine with
   certainty which temporary GRUUs are valid based solely on the
   response to the REGISTER requests it has issued, or from

   notifications according to RFC 3680 [2].  The extension defined in
   this document provides sufficient information for a UA to determine
   which temporary GRUUs are valid.

   The registration event package has provisions for including extension
   elements within the &lt;contact&gt; element.  This document defines new
   elements that may be used in that context to deliver the public and
   temporary GRUUs corresponding to the contact.

2.  Terminology

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. [1]

3.  Description

   Two new elements (&lt;pub-gruu&gt; and &lt;temp-gruu&gt;) are defined, each of
   which contains a GRUU.  The &lt;temp-gruu&gt; element also identifies the
   oldest temporary GRUU that is currently valid.

   These optional elements may be included within the body of a NOTIFY
   for the registration event package when GRUUs are associated with the
   contact.  The contact URI and the GRUUs are then all available to the
   watcher.

4.  Notifier Processing of SUBSCRIBE Requests

   Unchanged from RFC 3680 [2].

5.  Notifier Generation of NOTIFY Requests

   A notifier for the registration event package [2] SHOULD include the
   &lt;pub-gruu&gt; element when a contact has an instance ID and a public
   GRUU is associated with the combination of the AOR and the instance
   ID.  When present, the &lt;pub-gruu&gt; element MUST be positioned as a
   child of the &lt;contact&gt; element.

   A notifier for the registration event package [2] MAY include the
   &lt;temp-gruu&gt; element when a contact has an instance ID and a temporary
   GRUU is associated with the combination of the AOR and the instance
   ID.  This element SHOULD be included if the subscriber is also
   authorized to register to the AOR.  This element SHOULD NOT be
   included if the subscriber is not authorized to register to the AOR,
   unless there is an explicitly configured policy directing that it be
   included.  When present, the &lt;temp-gruu&gt; element MUST be positioned
   as a child of the &lt;contact&gt; element.

   Note that it is possible for multiple registered contacts to share
   the same instance ID.  In such a case, each &lt;contact&gt; element will
   have child &lt;pub-gruu&gt; and &lt;temp-gruu&gt; elements, which are identical
   to the corresponding child elements in those other &lt;contact&gt; elements
   that share the same instance ID.  Since a particular contact cannot
   be associated with more than one instance ID, a &lt;contact&gt; element
   will never have more than one &lt;pub-gruu&gt; and one &lt;temp-gruu&gt; child
   element.

   If the notifier includes the &lt;pub-gruu&gt; element, it MUST populate the
   element with the public GRUU that is associated with the instance ID
   and AOR of the registered contact.

   <span class="Verified-inline-styling" id='inline-2995'>   If the notifier includes the &lt;temp-gruu&gt; element, it MUST populate <button id="btn_2995" target="expand_2995" onclick='hideFunction("expand_2995")'>Expand</button>
   the element with the most recently assigned temporary GRUU that is
   associated with the instance ID and AOR of the registered contact.
   It MUST also populate the element with a &quot;first-cseq&quot; attribute
   corresponding to the first (oldest) currently active temporary GRUU
   that is associated with the instance ID and AOR of the registered
   contact.  The value of the &quot;first-cseq&quot; attribute is set to the value of
   the CSeq header field of the REGISTER request that caused that first
   temporary GRUU to be assigned.

6.  Subscriber Processing of NOTIFY Requests

   When a subscriber receives a registration event notification with a
   &lt;contact&gt; containing a &lt;pub-gruu&gt;, it MAY associate the public GRUU
   with the corresponding AOR and instance ID.  Any previously received
   public GRUU for the same AOR and instance ID MUST be discarded.  (It
   will no longer function.)

   When a subscriber receives a registration event notification with a
   &lt;contact&gt; containing a &lt;temp-gruu&gt;, it MAY associate the temporary
   GRUU, together with the &quot;callid&quot; and &quot;cseq&quot; attributes, with the
   corresponding AOR and instance ID.

   Subscribers that are unaware of this extension will, as required by
   [2], ignore the &lt;pub-gruu&gt; and &lt;temp-gruu&gt; elements.

6.1.  Managing Temporary GRUU Lifetime

   Section 4.2 of RFC 5627 [3] gives guidance for developers of UAs on
   how to ensure that only valid temporary GRUUs are retained and used
   by the UA.  A UA cannot always determine with certainty which
   temporary GRUUs are valid based solely on the information contained
   in responses to the REGISTER requests it has issued or from the
   information contained in notifications that conform solely to RFC
   3680 [2].  The extension defined in this document provides sufficient

   added information for a UA to determine which temporary GRUUs are
   valid.  The extension to RFC 3680 defined in this document provides
   added information to help with that process.  The following are steps
   that the UA MAY take to ensure it only retains valid GRUUs:

   o  The UA should subscribe to the registration event package for the
      AOR it is registering.

   o  When a UA receives a 2xx response to a REGISTER request, it may
      extract and retain temporary GRUUs from the response for future
      use, as long as they remain valid.  Appropriate GRUUs to retain
      are those corresponding to the contact address and instance ID it
      has registered.  (Typically, the UA will register only one contact
      address, and so receive at most one temporary GRUU.)

   o  The UA may add the temporary GRUU to the set of valid temporary
      GRUUs associated with the AOR.  (Note, in this case AOR is the
      To-address of the REGISTER request.)  To aid in tracking validity,
      the UA should also associate a &quot;callid&quot; attribute and &quot;cseq&quot;
      attribute with the temporary GRUU, with values obtained
      respectively from the Call-ID and CSeq values of the REGISTER
      response containing the temporary GRUU.

   o  If the UA receives a registration event notification with an AOR
      (that it supports) and a &lt;contact&gt;, for a contact address and
      instance ID (that it has registered and that contains a &lt;temp-
      gruu&gt;), it may update its set of valid temporary GRUUs associated
      with the AOR, as follows:

      *  It may add the temporary GRUU to the set.  To aid in tracking
         validity, the UA should associate the &quot;callid&quot; and &quot;cseq&quot;
         attributes of the &lt;contact&gt; with the GRUU in the set.

      *  It should remove any temporary GRUUs with a &quot;callid&quot; attribute
         value different from that in the value of the &quot;callid&quot;
         attribute of the &lt;contact&gt;, or with a &quot;cseq&quot; attribute with
         value less than the value of the &quot;first-cseq&quot; attribute of the
         &lt;temp-gruu&gt;.

   o  If the UA receives a registration event notification with an AOR
      that it supports, and there are no &lt;contact&gt; entries for its
      instance ID, then it should discard all the temporary GRUUs it has
      saved for that AOR.

7.  Sample reginfo Document

      Note: This example and others in the following section are
      indented for readability by the addition of a fixed amount of
      whitespace to the beginning of each line.  This whitespace is not
      part of the example.  The conventions of [7] are used to describe
      representation of long message lines.

   The following is an example registration information document that
   includes the new element:

     &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
         &lt;reginfo xmlns=&quot;urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:reginfo&quot;
             xmlns:gr=&quot;urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:gruuinfo&quot;
             version=&quot;0&quot; state=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
           &lt;registration aor=&quot;sip:user@example.com&quot; id=&quot;as9&quot;
                state=&quot;active&quot;&gt;
             &lt;contact id=&quot;76&quot; state=&quot;active&quot; event=&quot;registered&quot;
                duration-registered=&quot;36001&quot; expires=&quot;3599&quot;
                callid=&quot;1j9FpLxk3uxtm8tn@192.0.2.1&quot; cseq=&quot;54321&quot;
                q=&quot;0.8&quot;&gt;
                  &lt;uri&gt;sip:user@192.0.2.1&lt;/uri&gt;
     &lt;allOneLine&gt;
                  &lt;unknown-param name=&quot;+sip.instance&quot;&gt;
     &quot;&amp;lt;urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6&amp;gt;&quot;
     &lt;/unknown-param&gt;
     &lt;/allOneLine&gt;
     &lt;allOneLine&gt;
                  &lt;gr:pub-gruu uri=&quot;sip:user@example.com
     ;gr=hha9s8d-999a&quot;/&gt;
     &lt;/allOneLine&gt;
     &lt;allOneLine&gt;
                  &lt;gr:temp-gruu uri=&quot;sip:8ffkas08af7fasklzi9@example.com
     ;gr&quot; first-cseq=&quot;54301&quot;/&gt;
     &lt;/allOneLine&gt;
             &lt;/contact&gt;
           &lt;/registration&gt;
         &lt;/reginfo&gt;

8.  Examples

   Note: In the following examples, the SIP messages have been
   simplified, removing headers that are not pertinent to the example.

   When the value of the Content-Length header field is &quot;...&quot;, this
   means that the value should be the computed length of the body.

8.1.  Example: Welcome Notice

   Consider the Welcome Notices example in [2].  When the application
   server receives a notification of a new registration containing the
   reginfo shown in Section 7, it should address messages using the
   contained public GRUU as follows:

      MESSAGE sip:user@example.com;gr=hha9s8d-999a SIP/2.0
      To: &lt;sip:user@example.com&gt;
      From: &quot;SIPland Notifier&quot; &lt;sip:notifier@example.com&gt;;tag=7xy8
      Content-Type: text/plain
      Content-Length: ...

      Welcome to SIPland!
      Blah, blah, blah.

8.2.  Example: Implicit Registration

   In a 3GPP IMS setting, a UA may send a single register message,
   requesting assignment of GRUUs, as follows:

      REGISTER sip:example.net SIP/2.0
      From: &lt;sip:user_aor_1@example.net&gt;;tag=5ab4
      To: &lt;sip:user_aor_1@example.net&gt;
      Call-ID: faif9a@ua.example.com
      CSeq: 23001 REGISTER
      Contact: &lt;sip:ua.example.com&gt;
        ;expires=3600
        ;+sip.instance=&quot;&lt;urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6&gt;&quot;
      Supported: path, gruu
      Content-Length: 0

   The response reports success of the registration and returns the
   GRUUs assigned for the combination of AOR, instance ID, and Contact.
   It also indicates (via the P-Associated-URI header [6]) that there
   are two other associated AORs that may have been implicitly
   registered using the same contact.  Each of those implicitly
   registered AORs will have unique GRUUs assigned.  The REGISTER
   response will not include those GRUUs; it will only include the GRUUs
   for the AOR and instance ID explicitly included in the registration.

      SIP/2.0 200 OK
      From: &lt;sip:user_aor_1@example.net&gt;;tag=5ab4
      To: &lt;sip:user_aor_1@example.net&gt;;tag=373392
      Call-ID: faif9a@ua.example.com
      CSeq: 23001 REGISTER
      Path: &lt;sip:proxy.example.net;lr&gt;
      Service-Route: &lt;sip:proxy.example.net;lr&gt;

      Contact: &lt;sip:ua.example.com&gt;
        ;expires=3600
        ;+sip.instance=&quot;&lt;urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6&gt;&quot;
        ;pub-gruu=&quot;sip:user_aor_1@example.net;gr=hha9s8d-999a&quot;
        ;temp-gruu=&quot;sip:8ffkas08af7fasklzi9@example.net;gr&quot;
      P-Associated-URI: &lt;sip:user_aor_2@example.net&gt;,
        &lt;sip:+358504821437@example.net;user=phone&gt;
      Content-Length: 0

   The UA then subscribes to the registration event package as follows:

      SUBSCRIBE sip:user_aor_1@example.net SIP/2.0
      From: &lt;sip:user_aor_1@example.net&gt;;tag=27182
      To: &lt;sip:user_aor_1@example.net&gt;
      Call-ID: gbjg0b@ua.example.com
      CSeq: 45001 SUBSCRIBE
      Route: &lt;sip:proxy.example.net;lr&gt;
      Event: reg
      Expires: 3600
      Accept: application/reginfo+xml
      Contact: &lt;sip:user_aor_1@example.net;gr=hha9s8d-999a&gt;
      Content-Length: 0

   (The successful response to the subscription is not shown.)  Once the
   subscription is established, an initial notification is sent giving
   registration status.  In IMS deployments, the response includes, in

   The status indicates that the associated URIs all have the same
   contact registered.  It also includes the unique GRUUs that have been
   assigned to each.  The UA may then retain those GRUUs for use when
   establishing dialogs using the corresponding AORs.

9.  XML Schema Definition

   The &lt;pub-gruu&gt; and &lt;temp-gruu&gt; elements are defined within a new XML
   namespace URI.  This namespace is &quot;urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:gruuinfo&quot;.
   The schema for these elements is:

   &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
     &lt;xs:schema targetNamespace=&quot;urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:gruuinfo&quot;
       elementFormDefault=&quot;qualified&quot;
       attributeFormDefault=&quot;unqualified&quot;
       xmlns:xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;
       xmlns:tns=&quot;urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:gruuinfo&quot;&gt;
       &lt;xs:complexType name=&quot;pubGruu&quot;&gt;
         &lt;xs:attribute name=&quot;uri&quot; type=&quot;xs:anyURI&quot;
                       use=&quot;required&quot;/&gt;
       &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
       &lt;xs:complexType name=&quot;tempGruu&quot;&gt;
         &lt;xs:complexContent&gt;
           &lt;xs:extension base=&quot;tns:pubGruu&quot;&gt;
             &lt;xs:attribute name=&quot;first-cseq&quot;
                           type=&quot;xs:unsignedLong&quot;
                           use=&quot;required&quot;/&gt;

           &lt;/xs:extension&gt;
         &lt;/xs:complexContent&gt;
       &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
       &lt;xs:element name=&quot;pub-gruu&quot; type=&quot;tns:pubGruu&quot;/&gt;
       &lt;xs:element name=&quot;temp-gruu&quot; type=&quot;tns:tempGruu&quot;/&gt;
     &lt;/xs:schema&gt;

10.  IANA Considerations

   There are two IANA considerations associated with this specification.

10.1.  URN Sub-Namespace Registration

   This section registers a new XML namespace, per the guidelines in
   [4].

   URI: The URI for this namespace is urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:gruuinfo

   Registrant Contact: IETF, SIPPING working group, &lt;sipping@ietf.org&gt;,
   Paul Kyzivat &lt;pkyzivat@cisco.com&gt;

   XML:

         BEGIN
         &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
         &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML Basic 1.0//EN&quot;
                   &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-basic/xhtml-basic10.dtd&quot;&gt;
         &lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;
         &lt;head&gt;
           &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;content-type&quot;
              content=&quot;text/html;charset=iso-8859-1&quot;/&gt;
           &lt;title&gt;Reg Information GRUU Extension Namespace&lt;/title&gt;
         &lt;/head&gt;
         &lt;body&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;Namespace for Reg Information GRUU Extension&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:gruuinfo&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5628.txt&quot;&gt;
               RFC5628&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/body&gt;
         &lt;/html&gt;
         END

10.2.  XML Schema Registration

   This section registers an XML schema per the procedures in [4].

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:gruuinfo.

   Registrant Contact: IETF, SIPPING working group, &lt;sipping@ietf.org&gt;,
   Paul Kyzivat &lt;pkyzivat@cisco.com&gt;

   The XML for this schema can be found in Section 9.

11.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for the registration event package are
   discussed in RFC 3680 [2], and those considerations apply here.

   If a contact address obtained via subscription to the registration
   event package is not reachable by the subscriber, then its disclosure
   may arguably be considered a minimal security risk.  In that case,
   the inclusion of a GRUU may be considered to increase the risk by
   providing a reachable address.  On the other hand, requests addressed
   to a GRUU are always first processed by the servicing proxy before
   they reach the intended User Agent.  The proxy may control access as
   desired, just as it may for the AOR.  For instance, the proxy
   servicing a GRUU may accept requests from senders whose identity
   appears on a white list, and reject other requests.  In this respect,
   disclosing a GRUU presents no more risk than disclosing the AOR.

   Temporary GRUUs have an additional security consideration.  The
   intent of the temporary GRUU is to provide a contact address that
   cannot be correlated to the identity of the calling party.  The
   recipient of a call using a temporary GRUU may guess the identity of
   the calling party and then attempt to obtain the temporary GRUUs
   assigned to that caller to confirm the conjecture.  Two possible
   approaches to obtaining the temporary GRUUs are:

   o  Send a REGISTER request to a conjectured caller.

   o  Send a SUBSCRIBE request for the registration event package to the
      conjectured caller.

   Typically, REGISTER is restricted to devices or users that are
   authorized to originate and receive calls with the AOR.  Anonymity
   among users of the same AOR is hard to achieve and typically
   unnecessary.  It is recommended (see Section 5) that the
   authorization policy for the registration event package permit only
   those subscribers who are authorized to register to the AOR to
   receive temporary GRUUs.  With this policy, the confidentiality of

   the temporary GRUU will be the same with and without the registration
   event package.  User Agents that use a temporary GRUU should note
   that confidentiality does not extend to parties that are permitted to
   register to the AOR or to obtain the temporary GRUU when subscribing
   to the registration event package.
