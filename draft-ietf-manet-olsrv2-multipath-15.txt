   Multipath Extension for the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol
                           version 2 (OLSRv2)
                  draft-ietf-manet-olsrv2-multipath-15

Abstract

   This document specifies a multipath extension for the Optimized Link
   State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2) to discover multiple
   disjoint paths for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs).  Considering the
   characteristics of MANETs, especially the dynamic network topology,
   using multiple paths can increase aggregated throughput and improve
   the reliability by avoiding single route failures.  The
   interoperability with OLSRv2 is retained.

Internet-Draft              Multipath OLSRv2                    May 2017


1.  Introduction

   The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2)
   [RFC7181] is a proactive link state protocol designed for use in
   mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs).  It generates routing messages
   periodically to create and maintain a Routing Set, which contains
   routing information to all the possible destinations in the routing
   domain.  For each destination, there exists a unique Routing Tuple,
   which indicates the next hop to reach the destination.

   This document specifies an extension of the OLSRv2 protocol
   [RFC7181], to provide multiple disjoint paths when appropriate for a
   source-destination pair.  Because of the characteristics of MANETs
   [RFC2501], especially the dynamic topology, having multiple paths is
   helpful for increasing network throughput, improving forwarding
   reliability, and load balancing.

   Multipath OLSRv2 (MP-OLSRv2) specified in this document uses the
   Multipath Dijkstra algorithm by default to explore multiple disjoint
   paths from a source router to a destination router based on the
   topology information obtained through OLSRv2, and to forward the
   datagrams in a load-balancing manner using source routing.  MP-OLSRv2
   is designed to be interoperable with OLSRv2.

1.1.  Motivation and Experiments to Be Conducted

   This document is an experimental extension of OLSRv2 that can
   increase the data forwarding reliability in dynamic and high-load
   MANET scenarios by transmitting datagrams over multiple disjoint
   paths using source routing.  This mechanism is used because:

   o  Disjoint paths can avoid single route failures.

   o  Transmitting datagrams through parallel paths can increase
      aggregated throughput.

   o  Some scenarios may require some routers must (or must not) be
      used.

   o  Having control of the paths at the source benefits the load
      balancing and traffic engineering.

   o  An application of this extension is in combination with Forward
      Error Correction (FEC) coding applied across packets (erasure
      coding) [WPMC11].  Because the packet drops are normally bursty in
      a path (for example, due to route failure), erasure coding is less
      effective in single path routing protocols.  By providing multiple
      disjoint paths, the application of erasure coding with multipath

      protocol is more resilient to routing failures.

   While in existing deployments, running code and simulations have
   proven the interest of multipath extension for OLSRv2 in certain
   networks, more experiments and experiences are still needed to
   understand the effects of the protocol specified in this experimental
   document.  The multipath extension for OLSRv2 is expected to be
   revised documented as a Standard Track document once sufficient
   operational experience is obtained.  Other than general experiences,
   including the protocol specification and interoperability with base
   OLSRv2 implementations, experiences in the following aspects are
   highly appreciated:

   o  Optimal values for the number of multiple paths (NUMBER_OF_PATHS,
      Section 5) to be used.  This depends on the network topology and
      router density.

   o  Optimal values used in the metric functions.  Metric functions are
      applied to increase the metric of used links and nodes so as to
      obtain disjoint paths.  What kind of disjointness is desired
      (node-disjoint or link-disjoint) may depend on the layer 2
      protocol used, and can be achieved by applying different sets of
      metric functions.

   o  Use of different metric types.  This multipath extension can be
      used with metric types that meet the requirement of OLSRv2, such
      as [RFC7779].  The metric type used has also impact to the choice
      of metric functions as indicated in the previous bullet point.

   o  The impact of partial topology information to multipath
      calculation.  OLSRv2 maintains a partial topology information base
      to reduce protocol overhead.  Experience has shown that multiple
      paths can be obtained even with such partial information, however,
      depending on the Multi-Point Relay (MPR) selection algorithm used,
      the disjointness of the multiple paths might be impacted depending
      on the Multi-Point Relay (MPR) selection algorithm used.

   o  Use of IPv6 loose source routing.  In the current specification,
      only strict source routing is used for IPv6 based on [RFC6554].
      In [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header], the use of the loose
      source routing is also proposed in IPv6.  In scenarios where the
      length of the source routing header is critical, the loose source
      routing can be considered.

   o  Optimal choice of "key" routers for loose source routing.  In some
      cases, loose source routing is used to reduce overhead or for
      interoperability with OLSRv2 routers.  Other than the basic rules
      defined in the following parts of this document, optimal choices

      of routers to put in the loose source routing header can be
      further studied.

   o  Different path-selection schedulers.  Depending on the application
      type and transport layer type, either per-flow scheduler or per-
      datagram scheduler is applied.  By default, the traffic load
      should be equally distributed in multiple paths.  In some
      scenarios, weighted scheduling can be considered: for example, the
      paths with lower metrics (i.e., higher quality) can transfer more
      datagrams or flows compared to paths with higher metrics.

   o  The impacts of the delay variation due to multipath routing.
      [RFC2991] brings out some concerns of multipath routing,
      especially variable latencies when per-datagram scheduling is
      applied.  Although current experiment results show that multipath
      routing can reduce the jitter in dynamic scenarios, some transport
      protocols or applications may be sensitive to the datagram re-
      ordering.

   o  The disjoint multipath protocol has interesting application with
      erasure coding, especially for services like video/audio streaming
      [WPMC11].  The combination of erasure coding mechanisms and this
      extension is thus encouraged.

   o  Different algorithms to obtain multiple paths, other than the
      default Multipath Dijkstra algorithm introduced in Section 8.5.2
      of this specification.

   o  The use of multi-topology information.  By using [RFC7722],
      multiple topologies using different metric types can be obtained.
      Although there is no work defining how this extension can make use
      of the multi-topology information base yet, it is encouraged to
      experiment with the use of multiple metrics for building multiple
      paths.

   Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the MANET working
   group's mailing list at manet@ietf.org and/or the authors."

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in

   This document uses the terminology and notation defined in [RFC5444],
   [RFC6130], [RFC7181].  Additionally, it defines the following

   terminology:

   OLSRv2 Routing Process -  A routing process based on [RFC7181],
      without multipath extension specified in this document.

   MP-OLSRv2 Routing Process -  A multipath routing process based on
      this specification as an extension to [RFC7181].

   SR-OLSRv2 Routing Process -  A OLSRv2 Routing Process that supports
      source routing (SR), or an MP-OLSRv2 Routing Process.


3.  Applicability Statement

   As an extension of OLSRv2, this specification is applicable to MANETs
   for which OLSRv2 is applicable (see [RFC7181]).  It can operate on
   single or multiple interfaces to discover multiple disjoint paths
   from a source router to a destination router.  MP-OLSRv2 is designed
   for networks with dynamic topology to avoid single route failure.  It
   can also provide higher aggregated throughput and load balancing.

   In a router supporting MP-OLSRv2, MP-OLSRv2 does not necessarily
   replace OLSRv2 completely.  The extension can be applied for certain
   applications that are suitable for multipath routing (mainly video or
   audio streams), based on information such as a DiffServ codepoint
   [RFC2474].

   Compared to OLSRv2, this extension does not introduce any new message
   type.  A new Message TLV Type is introduced to identify the routers
   that support forwarding based on source routing header.  It is
   interoperable with OLSRv2 implementations that do not have this
   extension: as the MP-OLSRv2 uses source routing, in IPv4 networks the
   interoperability is achieved using loose source routing headers; in
   IPv6 networks, it is achieved by eliminating routers that do not
   support IPv6 strict source routing.

   MP-OLSRv2 supports two different, but interoperable multipath
   calculation approaches: proactive and reactive.  In the proactive
   calculation, the paths to all the destinations are calculated before
   needed.  In the reactive calculation, only the paths to desired
   destination(s) are calculated on demand.  The proactive approach
   requires more computational resources than the reactive one.  The
   reactive approach requires the IP forwarding plane to trigger the
   multipath calculation.

   MP-OLSRv2 forwards datagrams using the source routing header.  As
   there are multiple paths to each destination, MP-OLSRv2 requires the
   IP forwarding plane to be able to choose which source route to be put

Internet-Draft              Multipath OLSRv2                    May 2017


   in the source routing header based on the path scheduler defined by
   MP-OLSRv2.  For IPv4 networks, implementation of loose source routing
   is required following [RFC0791].  For IPv6 networks, implementation
   of strict source routing is required following the source routing
   header generation and processing defined in [RFC6554].


4.  Protocol Overview and Functioning

   This specification uses OLSRv2 [RFC7181] to:

   o  Identify all the reachable routers in the network.

   o  Identify a sufficient subset of links in the networks, so that
      routes can be calculated to all reachable destinations.

   o  Provide a Routing Set containing the shortest routes from this
      router to all destinations.

   In addition, the MP-OLSRv2 Routing Process identifies the routers
   that support source routing by adding a new Message TLV in HELLO and
   Topology Control (TC) messages.  Based on the above information
   acquired, every MP-OLSRv2 Routing Process is aware of a reduced
   topology map of the network and the routers supporting source
   routing.

   A Multipath Routing Set containing the multipath information is
   maintained.  It may either be proactively calculated or reactively
   calculated:

   o  In the proactive approach, multiple paths to all possible
      destinations are calculated and updated based on control message
      exchange.  The routes are thus available before they are actually
      needed.

   o  In the reactive approach, a multipath algorithm is invoked on
      demand, i.e., only when there is a datagram to be sent from the
      source to the destination, and there is no available Routing Tuple
      in the Multipath Routing Set. This requires the IP forwarding
      information base to trigger the multipath calculation specified in
      Section 8.5 when no Multipath Routing Tuple is available.  The
      reactive operation is local to the router and no additional
      routing control messages exchange is required.  When the paths are
      being calculated, the datagrams SHOULD be buffered unless the
      router does not have enough memory.

   Routers in the same network may choose either proactive or reactive
   multipath calculation independently according to their computation

   resources.  The Multipath Dijkstra algorithm (defined in Section 8.5)
   is introduced as the default algorithm to generate multiple disjoint
   paths from a source to a destination, and such information is kept in
   the Multipath Routing Set.

   The datagram is forwarded based on source routing.  When there is a
   datagram to be sent to a destination, the source router acquires a
   path from the Multipath Routing Set. The path information is stored
   in the datagram header using the source routing header.


5.  Parameters and Constants

   In addition to the parameters and constants defined in [RFC7181],
   this specification uses the parameters and constants described in
   this section.

5.1.  Router Parameters

   NUMBER_OF_PATHS   The number of paths desired by the router.

   MAX_SRC_HOPS   The maximum number of hops allowed to be put in the
      source routing header.  A value set zero means there is no
      limitation on the maximum number of hops.  In an IPv6 network, it
      MUST be set to 0 because [RFC6554] supports only strict source
      routing.  All the intermediate routers MUST be included in the
      source routing header, which a various number of hops.  In an IPv4
      network, it MUST be strictly less than 11 and greater than 0 due
      to the length limit of the IPv4 header.

   CUTOFF_RATIO   The ratio that defines the maximum metric of a path
      compared to the shortest path kept in the OLSRv2 Routing Set. For
      example, the metric to a destination is R_metric based on the
      Routing Set. Then the maximum metric allowed for a path is
      CUTOFF_RATIO * R_metric.  CUTOFF_RATIO MUST be greater than or
      equal to 1.  Setting the number low makes it less likely that
      additional paths will be found -- for example, setting it to 1
      will only consider equal length paths.

   SR_TC_INTERVAL   The maximum time between the transmission of two
      successive TC messages by an MP-OLSRv2 Routing Process.

   SR_HOLD_TIME  The minimum value in the TLV with Type = VALIDITY_TIME
      included in TC messages generated based on SR_TC_INTERVAL.

6.  Packets and Messages

   This extension employs the routing control messages HELLO and TC
   (Topology Control) as defined in OLSRv2 [RFC7181] to obtain network
   topology information.  For the datagram to support source routing, a
   source routing header is added to each datagram routed by this
   extension.  Depending on the IP version used, the source routing
   header is defined in this section.

6.1.  HELLO and TC messages

   HELLO and TC messages used by the MP-OLSRv2 Routing Process use the
   same format as defined in [RFC7181].  In addition, a new Message TLV
   type is defined, to identify the originator of the HELLO or TC
   message that supports source route forwarding.  The new Message TLV
   type is introduced for enabling MP-OLSRv2 as an extension of OLSRv2:
   only the routers supporting source-route forwarding can be used in
   the source routing header of a datagram, because adding a router that
   does not understand the source routing header will cause routing
   failure.

6.1.1.  SOURCE_ROUTE TLV

   SOURCE_ROUTE TLV is a Message TLV signaling that the message is
   generated by a router that supports source-route forwarding.  It can
   be an MP-OLSRv2 Routing Process, or an OLSRv2 Routing Process that
   supports source-route forwarding.

   Every HELLO or TC message generated by a MP-OLSRv2 Routing Process
   MUST have exactly one SOURCE_ROUTE TLV without value.

   Every HELLO or TC message generated by an OLSRv2 Routing Process MUST
   have exactly one SOURCE_ROUTE TLV, if the OLSRv2 Routing Process
   supports source-route forwarding, and is willing to join the source
   route generated by other MP-OLSRv2 Routing Processes.  The existence
   of SOURCE_ROUTE TLV MUST be consistent for a specific OLSRv2 Routing
   Process, i.e., either it adds SOURCE_ROUTE TLV to all its HELLO/TC
   messages, or it does not add SOURCE_ROUTE TLV to any HELLO/TC
   messages.

6.2.  Datagram

6.2.1.  Source Routing Header in IPv4

   In IPv4 [RFC0791] networks, the MP-OLSRv2 Routing Process employs the
   loose source routing header, as defined in [RFC0791].  It exists as
   an option header, with option class 0, and option number 3.

Internet-Draft              Multipath OLSRv2                    May 2017


   The source route information is kept in the "route data" field of the
   loose source route header.

6.2.2.  Source Routing Header in IPv6

   In IPv6 [RFC2460] networks, the MP-OLSRv2 Routing Process employs the
   source routing header as defined in section 3 of [RFC6554], with IPv6
   Routing Type 3.

   The source route information is kept in the "Addresses" field of the
   routing header.


7.  Information Bases

   Each MP-OLSRv2 Routing Process maintains the information bases as
   defined in [RFC7181].  Additionally, a Multipath Information Base is
   used for this specification.  It includes the protocol sets as
   defined below.

7.1.  SR-OLSRv2 Router Set

   The SR-OLSRv2 Router Set records the routers that support source-
   route forwarding.  This includes routers that run the MP-OLSRv2
   Routing Process or the OLSRv2 Routing Process with source-route
   forwarding support.  The set consists of SR-OLSRv2 Router Tuples:

   (SR_addr, SR_time)

   where:

   SR_addr -   is the originator address of the router that supports
      source-route forwarding;

   SR_time -   is the time until which the SR-OLSRv2 Router Tuple is
      considered valid.

7.2.  Multipath Routing Set

   The Multipath Routing Set records the full path information of
   different paths to the destination.  It consists of Multipath Routing
   Tuples:

   (MR_dest_addr, MR_path_set)

   where:

Internet-Draft              Multipath OLSRv2                    May 2017


   MR_dest_addr -   is the network address of the destination, either
      the network address of an interface of a destination router or the
      network address of an attached network;

   MP_path_set -   contains the multiple paths to the destination.  It
      consists of a set of Path Tuples.

   Each Path Tuple is defined as:

   (PT_metric, PT_address[1], PT_address[2], ..., PT_address[n])

   where:

   PT_metric -   is the metric of the path to the destination, measured
      in LINK_METRIC_TYPE defined in [RFC7181];

   PT_address[1, ..., n-1] -   are the addresses of intermediate routers
      to be visited numbered from 1 to n-1, where n is the number of
      routers in the path, i.e., the hop count.


8.  Protocol Details

   This protocol is based on OLSRv2, and extended to discover multiple
   disjoint paths from a source router to a destination router.  It
   retains the basic routing control packets formats and processing of
   OLSRv2 to obtain the topology information of the network.  The main
   differences from the OLSRv2 Routing Process are the datagram
   processing at the source router and datagram forwarding.

8.1.  HELLO and TC Message Generation

   HELLO messages are generated according to Section 15.1 of [RFC7181],
   plus a single message TLV with Type := SOURCE_ROUTE included.

   TC messages are generated according to Section 16.1 of [RFC7181] plus
   a single message TLV with Type := SOURCE_ROUTE included.

   For the routers that do not generate TC messages according to
   [RFC7181], at least one TC message MUST be generated by an MP-OLSRv2
   Routing Process during the SR_TC_INTERVAL (Section 5), which MUST be
   greater than or equal to TC_INTERVAL.  Those TC messages MUST NOT
   carry any advertised neighbor addresses.  This serves for those
   routers to advertise the SOURCE_ROUTE TLV so that the other routers
   can be aware of the source-route enabled routers so as to be used as
   destinations of multipath routing.  The validity time associated with
   the VALIDITY_TIME TLV in such TC messages equals SR_HOLD_TIME, which
   MUST be greater than the SR_TC_INTERVAL.  If the TC message carries



Yi & Parrein            Expires November 25, 2017              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft              Multipath OLSRv2                    May 2017


   an optional INTERVAL_TIME TLV, it MUST have a value encoding the
   SR_TC_INTERVAL.

8.2.  HELLO and TC Message Processing

   HELLO and TC messages are processed according to section 15.3 and
   16.3 of [RFC7181].

   In addition to the reasons specified in [RFC7181] for discarding a
   HELLO message or a TC message on reception, a HELLO or TC message
   received MUST be discarded if it has more than one Message TLV with
   Type = SOURCE_ROUTE.

   For every HELLO or TC message received, if there is a Message TLV
   with Type := SOURCE_ROUTE, create or update (if the Tuple exists
   already) the SR-OLSR Router Tuple with

   o  SR_addr := originator address of the HELLO or TC message

   o  SR_time := current_time + validity time of the TC or HELLO message
      defined in [RFC7181].

8.3.  MPR Selection

   Each MP-OLSRv2 Routing Process selects routing MPRs and flooding MPRs
   following Section 18 of [RFC7181].  In a mixed network with OLSRv2-
   only routers, the following considerations apply when calculating
   MPRs:

   o  MP-OLSRv2 routers SHOULD be preferred as routing MPRs to increase
      the possibility of finding disjoint paths using MP-OLSRv2 routers.

   o  The number of routing MPRs that run MP-OLSRv2 Routing Process MUST
      be equal or greater than NUMBER_OF_PATHS if there are enough MP-
      OLSRv2 symmetric neighbors.  Otherwise all the MP-OLSRv2 routers
      are selected as routing MPRs, expect the routers with willingness
      WILL_NEVER.

8.4.  Datagram Processing at the MP-OLSRv2 Originator

   If datagrams without source routing header need to be forwarded using
   multiple paths (for example, based on the information of a DiffServ
   codepoint [RFC2474]), the MP-OLSRv2 Routing Process will try to find
   the Multipath Routing Tuple where:

   o  MR_dest_addr = destination of the datagram

   If no matching Multipath Routing Tuple is found and the Multipath



Yi & Parrein            Expires November 25, 2017              [Page 12]

Internet-Draft              Multipath OLSRv2                    May 2017


   Routing Set is maintained proactively, it indicates that there is no
   multipath route available to the desired destination.  The datagram
   is forwarded following the OLSRv2 Routing Process.

   If no matching Multipath Routing Tuple is found and the Multipath
   Routing Set is maintained reactively, the multipath algorithm defined
   in Section 8.5 is invoked, to calculate the Multipath Routing Tuple
   to the destination.  If the calculation does not return any Multipath
   Routing Tuple, the following steps are aborted and the datagram is
   forwarded following the OLSRv2 Routing Process.

   If a matching Multipath Routing Tuple is obtained, the Path Tuples of
   the Multipath Routing Tuple are applied to the datagrams using either
   per-flow scheduling or per-datagram scheduling, depending on the
   transport layer protocol and the application used.  By default, per-
   flow scheduling is used, especially for the transport protocols that
   are sensitive to reordering, such as TCP.  The path selection
   decision is made on the first datagram and all subsequent datagrams
   of the same flow use the same path.  If the path is detected broken
   before the flow is closed, another path with the most similar metric
   is used.  Per-datagram scheduling is recommended if the traffic is
   insensitive to reordering such as non-reliable transmission of media
   traffic, or when erasure coding is applied.  In such case, each
   datagram selects its paths independently.

   By default, the traffic load should be equally distributed in
   multiple paths.  Other path scheduling mechanisms (e.g., assigning
   more traffic over better paths) are also possible and will not impact
   the interoperability of different implementations.

   The addresses in PT_address[1, ..., n-1] of the chosen Path Tuple are
   thus added to the datagram header as the source routing header.  For
   IPv6 networks, strict source routing is used, thus all the
   intermediate routers in the path are stored in the source routing
   header following the format defined in section 3 of [RFC6554] with
   Routing Type set to 3.

   For IPv4 networks, loose source routing is used, with the following
   rules:

   o  Only the addresses that exist in SR-OLSR Router Set can be added
      to the source routing header.

   o  If the length of the path (n) is greater than MAX_SRC_HOPS
      (Section 5) or adding the whole path information exceeds the MTU,
      only the "key" routers in the path are kept.  By default, the key
      routers are uniformly chosen in the path.  If further information
      such as capacity of the routers (e.g., battery life) or the



Yi & Parrein            Expires November 25, 2017              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft              Multipath OLSRv2                    May 2017


      routers' willingness in forwarding data is available, the routers
      with higher capacity and willingness are preferred.

   o  The routers that are considered not appropriate for forwarding
      indicated by external policies should be avoided.

   It is not recommended to fragment the IP packet if the packet with
   the source routing header would exceed the minimum MTU along the
   path.  Depending on the size of the routing domain, the MTU should be
   at least 1280 + 40 (for the outer IP header) + 16 * diameter of the
   network in number of hops (for the source routing header).  If the
   links in the network have different MTU sizes, by using technologies
   like Path MTU Discovery, the routers are able to be aware of the MTU
   along the path.  The size of the datagram plus the size of IP headers
   (including the source routing header) should not exceed the minimum
   MTU along the path, otherwise, the source routing should not be used.

   If the destination of the datagrams is out the MP-OLSRv2 routing
   domain, the datagram must be source routed to the gateway between the
   MP-OLSRv2 routing domain and the rest of the Internet.  The gateway
   MUST remove the source routing header before forwarding the datagram
   to the rest of the Internet.

8.5.  Multipath Calculation

8.5.1.  Requirements of Multipath Calculation

   The Multipath Routing Set maintains the information of multiple paths
   to the destination.  The Path Tuples of the Multipath Routing Set
   (Section 7.2) are generated based on a multipath algorithm.

   For each path to a destination, the algorithm must provide:

   o  The metric of the path to the destination,

   o  The list of intermediate routers on the path.

   For IPv6 networks, as strict source routing is used, only the routers
   that exist in the SR-OLSRv2 Router Set are considered in the path
   calculation, i.e., only the source-routing supported routers can
   exist in the path.

   After the calculation of multiple paths, the metric of paths (denoted
   c_i for path i) to the destination is compared to the R_metric of the
   the OLSRv2 Routing Tuple ([RFC7181]) to the same destination.  If the
   metric c_i is greater than R_metric * CUTOFF_RATIO (Section 5), the
   corresponding path i SHOULD NOT be used.  If less than 2 paths are
   found with metrics less than R_metric * CUTOFF_RATIO, the router



Yi & Parrein            Expires November 25, 2017              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft              Multipath OLSRv2                    May 2017


   SHOULD fall back to OLSRv2 Routing Process without using multipath
   routing.  This can happen if there are too many OLSRv2-only routers
   in the network, and requiring multipath routing may result in
   inferior paths.

   By invoking the multipath algorithm, up to NUMBER_OF_PATHS paths are
   obtained and added to the Multipath Routing Set by creating a
   Multipath Routing Tuple with:

   o  MR_dest_addr := destination of the datagram

   o  An MP_path_set with calculated Path Tuples.  Each Path Tuple
      corresponds to a path obtained in the Multipath Dijkstra
      algorithm, with PT_metric := metric of the calculated path and
      PT_address[1, ..., n-1] := list of intermediate routers.

8.5.2.  Multipath Dijkstra Algorithm

   This section introduces the Multipath Dijkstra Algorithm as a default
   algorithm.  It tries to obtain disjoint paths when appropriate, but
   does not guarantee strict disjoint paths.  The use of other
   algorithms is not prohibited, as long as the requirements described
   in Section 8.5.1 are met.  Using different multipath algorithms will
   not impact the interoperability.

   The general principle of the Multipath Dijkstra Algorithm [ADHOC11]
   is using Dijkstra algorithm for multiple iterations, and at iteration
   i to look for the shortest path P[i] to the destination d.  After
   each iteration, the metric of used links is increased.  Compared to
   the original Dijkstra's algorithm, the main modification consists in
   adding two incremental functions named metric functions fp and fe in
   order to prevent the next steps resulting in similar paths:

   o  fp(c) is used to increase metrics of arcs belonging to the
      previous path P[i-1] (with i>1), where c is the value of the
      previous metric.  This encourages future paths to use different
      arcs but not different vertices.

   o  fe(c) is used to increase metrics of the arcs that lead to
      intermediate vertices of the previous path P[i-1] (with i>1),
      where c is the value of the previous metric.  The "lead to" means
      that only one vertex of the arc belongs to the previous path
      P[i-1], while the other vertex does not.  The "intermediate" means
      that the source and destination vertices are not considered.

   Considering the simple example in Figure 1: a path P[i] S--A--D is
   obtained at step i.  For the next step, the metric of link S--A and
   A--D are to be increased using fp(c), because they belong to the path



Yi & Parrein            Expires November 25, 2017              [Page 15]

Internet-Draft              Multipath OLSRv2                    May 2017


   P[i].  A--B is to be increased using fe(c), because A is an
   intermediate vertex of path P[i], and B is not part of P[i].  B--D is
   unchanged.

                                          B
                                       /    \
                                      /      \
                                     /        \
                          S---------A-----------D



                                 Figure 1

   It is possible to choose different fp and fe to get link-disjoint
   paths or node-disjoint paths as desired.  A recommendation for
   configuration of fp and fe is given in Section 9.

   To get NUMBER_OF_PATHS different paths, for each path P[i] (i = 1,
   ..., NUMBER_OF_PATHS) do:

   1.  Run Dijkstra's algorithm to get the shortest path P[i] for the
       destination d.

   2.  Apply metric function fp to the metric of links (in both
       directions) in P[i].

   3.  Apply metric function fe to the metric of links (in both
       directions) that lead to routers used in P[i].

   A simple example of the Multipath Dijkstra Algorithm is illustrated
   in Appendix A.

8.6.  Multipath Routing Set Updates

   The Multipath Routing Set MUST be updated when the Local Information
   Base, the Neighborhood Information Base, or the Topology Information
   Base indicate a change (including of any potentially used outgoing
   neighbor metric values) of the known symmetric links and/or attached
   networks in the MANET, hence changing the Topology Graph, as
   described in section 17.7 of [RFC7181].  How the Multipath Routing
   Set is updated depends on whether the set is maintained reactively or
   proactively:

   o  In reactive mode, all the Tuples in the Multipath Routing Set are
      removed.  The new arriving datagrams will be processed as
      specified in Section 8.4;




Yi & Parrein            Expires November 25, 2017              [Page 16]

Internet-Draft              Multipath OLSRv2                    May 2017


   o  In proactive mode, the route to all the destinations are updated
      according to Section 8.5.

8.7.  Datagram Forwarding

   In IPv4 networks, datagrams are forwarded using loose source routing
   as specified in Section 3.1 of [RFC0791].

   In IPv6 networks, datagrams are forwarded using strict source routing
   as specified in Section 4.2 of [RFC6554], except the applied routers
   are MP-OLSRv2 routers rather than RPL routers.  The last hop of the
   source route MUST remove the source routing header.


9.  Configuration Parameters

   This section gives default values and guidelines for setting
   parameters defined in Section 5.  Network administrators may wish to
   change certain or all the parameters for different network scenarios.
   As an experimental protocol, the users of this protocol are also
   encouraged to explore different parameter setting in various network
   environments, and provide feedback.

   o  NUMBER_OF_PATHS := 3.  This parameter defines the number of
      parallel paths used in datagram forwarding.  Setting it to one
      makes the specification identical to OLSRv2.  Setting it to too
      large values may lead to unnecessary computational overhead and
      inferior paths.

   o  MAX_SRC_HOPS := 10, for IPv4 networks.  For IPv6 networks, it MUST
      be set to 0, i.e., no constraint on maximum number of hops.

   o  CUTOFF_RATIO := 1.5.  It MUST be greater or equal than 1.

   o  SR_TC_INTERVAL := 10 x TC_INTERVAL.  It MUST be greater than or
      equal to TC_INTERVAL.  It SHOULD be significantly greater than
      TC_INTERVAL to reduce unnecessary TC message generations.

   o  SR_HOLD_TIME := 3 x SR_TC_INTERVAL.  It MUST be greater than
      SR_TC_INTERVAL and SHOULD allow for a small number of lost
      messages.

   If Multipath Dijkstra Algorithm is applied:

   o  fp(c) := 4*c, where c is the original metric of the link.

   o  fe(c) := 2*c, where c is the original metric of the link.

Internet-Draft              Multipath OLSRv2                    May 2017


   The setting of metric functions fp and fc defines the preference of
   obtained multiple disjoint paths.  If id is the identity function,
   i.e., fp(c)=c, 3 cases are possible:

   o  if id=fe<fp: only increase the metric of related links;

   o  if id<fe=fp: apply equal increase to the metric of related nodes
      and links;

   o  if id<fe<fp: apply greater increase to the metric of related
      links.

   Increasing the metric of related links or nodes means avoiding the
   use of such links or nodes in the next path to be calculated.


10.  Implementation Status

   The RFC Editor is advised to remove the entire section before
   publication, as well as the reference to RFC 7942.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].  The
   description of implementations in this section is intended to assist
   the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to RFCs.
   Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here
   does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort has
   been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied
   by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not be
   construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

   Until April 2015, there are 3 open source implementations of the
   protocol specified in this document, for both testbed and simulation
   use.

11.  Security Considerations

   As an extension of [RFC7181], the security considerations and



Yi & Parrein            Expires November 25, 2017              [Page 19]

Internet-Draft              Multipath OLSRv2                    May 2017


   security architecture illustrated in [RFC7181] are applicable to this
   MP-OLSRv2 specification.  The implementations without security
   mechanisms are vulnerable to threats discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-manet-olsrv2-sec-threats].

   In a mixed network with OLSRv2-only routers, a compromised router can
   add SOURCE_ROUTE TLVs in its TC and HELLO messages, which will make
   other MP-OLSRv2 Routing Processes believe that it supports source
   routing.  This will increase the possibility of being chosen as MPRs
   and put into the source routing header.  The former will make it
   possible to manipulate the flooding of TC messages and the latter
   will make the datagram pass through the compromised router.

   As with [RFC7181], a conformant implementation of MP-OLSRv2 MUST, at
   minimum, implement the security mechanisms specified in [RFC7183] to
   provide integrity and replay protection of routing control messages.

   The MP-OLSRv2 Routing Process MUST drop datagrams entering or exiting
   a OLSRv2/MP-OLSRv2 routing domain that contain a source routing
   header.  Compared to OLSRv2, the use of the source routing header in
   this specification introduces vulnerabilities related to source
   routing attacks, which include bypassing filtering devices, bandwidth
   exhaustion of certain routers, etc.  Those attacks are discussed in
   Section 5 of [RFC6554] and [RFC5095].  The influence is limited to
   the OLSRv2/MP-OLSRv2 routing domain, because the source routing
   header is used only in the current routing domain.

   If the multiple paths are calculated reactively, the datagrams SHOULD
   be buffered while the paths are being calculated.  Because the path
   calculation is local and no control message is exchanged, the
   buffering time should be trivial.  However, depending on the CPU
   power and memory of the router, a maximum buffer size SHOULD be set
   to avoid occupying too much memory of the router.  When the buffer is
   full, the oldest datagrams are dropped.  A possible attack that a
   malicious application could launch is that it initiates a large
   amount of datagrams to all the other routers in the network, thus
   triggering path calculation to all the other routers and during which
   the datagrams are buffered.  This might flush other legitimate
   datagrams.  But the impact of the attack is transient: once the path
   calculation is finished, the datagrams are forwarded and the buffer
   goes back to empty.

Appendix A.  Examples of Multipath Dijkstra Algorithm

   This appendix gives two examples of Multipath Dijkstra algorithm.

   A network topology is depicted in Figure 2.

   The capital letters are the names of routers.  An arbitrary metric
   with value between 1 and 3 is used.  The initial metrics of all the
   links are indicated in the parentheses.  The incremental functions
   fp(c)=4c and fe(c)=2c are used in this example.  Two paths from
   router S to router D are demanded.

   On the first run of the Dijkstra algorithm, the shortest path S->A->D
   with metric 3 is obtained.

   The incremental function fp is applied to increase the metric of the
   link S-A and A-D. fe is applied to increase the metric of the link
   A-B and A-C.  Figure 3 shows the link metrics after the increment.

                                 Figure 3

   On the second run of the Dijkstra algorithm, the second path
   S->B->C->D with metric 6 is obtained.

   As mentioned in Section 8.5, the Multipath Dijkstra Algorithm does
   not guarantee strict disjoint paths in order to avoid choosing
   inferior paths.  For example, given the topology in Figure 4, two
   paths from node S to D are desired.  On the top of the figure, there
   is a high cost path between S and D.

   If a algorithm tries to obtain strict disjoint paths, the two paths
   obtained will be S--B--D and S--(high cost path)--D, which are
   extremely unbalanced.  It is undesirable because it will cause huge
   delay variance between the paths.  By using the Multipath Dijkstra
   algorithm, which is based on the punishing scheme, S--B--D and
   S--B--C--D will be obtained.

                             --high cost path-
                            /                 \
