1. Introduction

   This draft describes an existing information model (IM) relevant to
   Network Topology [ONF TR-512] and illustrates how it can be used to
   help ensure the consistency and completeness of the YANG data model
   (DM) for TE topologies solutions development work in TEAS.

2. Background and Motivation

   Information Models (IM) and Data Models (DM) are related but
   different.  An IM provides an abstract, conceptual view of the system
   being modeled in terms of its constituent parts (objects),
   independent of any specific implementations or protocols used to
   transport the data; it hides all protocol and implementation details
   (RFC 3444, TM Forum/NGCOR, ITU-T SG 15).  A DM is a concrete
   specification in a particular language of an interface to, in this
   case, a controlled/managed system.  The intention of the distinction
   between IMs and DMs has been to separate the modeling of problem
   space semantics from the modeling of the implementation of those
   semantics (though the dividing line has not always been clearly
   articulated).

   A DM may be derived from an IM though it is often created without
   (explicit or obviously implicit) reference to one.  When a DM is
   derived from an IM, the DM and the components of the system it
   provides control/management access to are traceable to the
   definitions provided in the IM.  There is no ambiguity between
   designer, developer, user or operator regarding the name, function,
   and information elements that are associated with a particular
   managed object.

   As described in [I-D.betts], when DMs are created ''in isolation''
   solely for the purpose of encoding specific interfaces, they may do
   that job adequately for any particular interface but in complex
   domains may create opportunities for confusion, duplication of
   effort, lack of interoperability, and lack of extensibility. In the
   past, ad-hoc development of DMs has caused significant operational
   and implementation inefficiencies in our industry.

   Since March 2014, upon IESG recommendation that SNMP no longer be
   used for new work re configuration and that NETCONF/YANG be used
   instead, there has been an explosion of YANG DM development in IETF.
   It has consequently been recognized as essential to assure proper
   coordination of YANG DM development (including reaching out to
   different SDOs/consortia), as well as to assure that the YANG modules
   themselves provide a good representation of what is being modeled, to
   meet expectations of functionality, quality, and interoperability.
   In order to facilitate this objective, guidance from available
   pertinent IMs can be valuable.

   This draft describes an existing information model relevant to
   Network Topology [ONF TR-512], which is part of the Common
   Information Model (ONF-CIM) of network resources (as described in [I-
   D.betts]), that can be leveraged to assess the consistency and
   completeness of related YANG modules under development.  Being part
   of a Common Information Model, it will not lead to development of
   incompatible/uncoordinated models that can be difficult to maintain
   as other purpose-specific interfaces are developed.

3. The Common Information Model

   This section provides a high level introduction to the ONF Common
   Information Model (ONF-CIM), and in particular its Core Model
   Fragment (see [ONF TR-512]), to provide an overall context for the
   topology relevant subset.

   An information model describes the things in a domain in terms of
   objects, their properties (represented as attributes), and their
   relationships.

   The ONF-CIM is expressed in a formal language called UML (Unified
   Modeling Language). UML has a number of basic model elements, called

Internet-Draft   Usage of an IM for network topology          July 2015


   UML artifacts. In order to assure a consistent and harmonized
   modeling approach, only a selected subset of these UML artifacts were
   used in the development of the ONF-CIM according to guidelines for
   creating an information model expressed in UML (see the UML
   Guidelines document in the ONF TR-512 [ONF TR-512]).

   The ONF-CIM has been developed using the Papyrus open source UML
   Tool, for which a detailed guidelines document is available (see the
   Papyrus Guidelines document in the ONF TR-512 [ONF TR-512]). This
   guidelines document also describes how the modelers constructing the
   ONF-CIM can cooperate in the GitHub environment to allow for separate
   and still coordinated development of the ONF-CIM fragments.

   The OMF-CIM includes all of the artifacts (objects, attributes,
   relationships, etc.) that are necessary to describe the domain for
   the applications being developed.

   It will be necessary to continually expand and refine the ONF-CIM
   over time as, for example to add, new applications, capabilities or
   forwarding technologies, or to refine the ONF-CIM as new insights are
   gained. To allow these extensions to be made in a seamless manner,
   the ONF-CIM is structured into a number of model fragments. This
   modeling process allows the fragments that contain these extensions
   to be developed, by the domain experts, with as much independence as
   possible.  This process is further articulated in [I-D.betts].

3.1. Core Model Fragment

   The Core Model Fragment of the ONF-CIM consists of model artifacts
   that are intended for use by multiple applications and/or forwarding
   technologies.

   For navigability, the Core Model Fragment is further sub-structured
   into modules. Currently, these consist of a Core Network Module and a
   Core Foundation Module.

3.1.1. Core Network Module

   The Core Network Module (CNM) consists of artifacts that model the
   essential network aspects that are neutral to the forwarding
   technology of the network. The CNM currently encompasses Topology,

Internet-Draft   Usage of an IM for network topology          July 2015


   Termination, and Forwarding aspects (subsets of the CNM) as described
   below:

   -  Topology Subset of CNM

      The Topology subset of the CNM supports the modeling of network
      topology information, which can be used to build the topology
      database and depict the topology. Object classes representing
      topological entities include:

      o Forwarding Domain (FD): Offers the potential to enable
        forwarding of information.

      o Link (L): Models the adjacency between two or more FDs. A Link
        has LinkEnds (LE).

      o Logical Termination Point (LTP): Models the ports of a link. It
        encapsulates the termination, adaptation, and OAM functions of
        one or more transport layers.

      o Network Element (NE): While not actually part of topology, a NE
        brings meaning to the FD and the LTP contexts (and hence the
        links). A NE represents physical equipment ''bundling'' to
        provide a view of management scope, management access, and
        session.

      The Topology subset of the CNM supports network topology
      abstraction and virtualization. FD abstraction is supported via
      recursive aggregation and virtualization via partitioning of
      resources according to the resource dedication criterion.

   -  Forwarding Subset of CNM

      The Forwarding subset of the CNM (not covered in detail in this
      draft) supports configuration of forwarding entities, including
      their setup, modification, and tear down. Artifacts representing
      the forwarding construct include:

      o ForwardingConstruct (FC): In conjunction with the EndPoint, FC
        models the enabled forwarding between two EPs across a FD.

Internet-Draft   Usage of an IM for network topology          July 2015


      o EndPoint (EP): Models the access to the FC, and associates the
        FC to the LTP. When the FC supports protection, the EP also
        indicates its role in the protection scheme, i.e., whether it
        is a working or protection EP.

      o FcRoute: Also known as SncRoute. It models the individual
        routes of an FC.

      o FcSwitch: Also known as SncSwitch. It models the switched
        forwarding of traffic (traffic flow) between EPs and is present
        where there is protection functionality in the FD.

   -  Termination Subset of CNM

      The Termination subset of the CNM (not covered in detail in this
      draft) supports modeling of the processing of transport
      characteristic information, such as termination, adaptation, OAM,
      etc. Artifacts representing the termination and adaptation and OAM
      construct include:

      o Logical Termination Point (LTP): See the LTP description in the
        Topology Subset

      o Layer Protocol (LP): This identifies the type of signal and is
        the anchor for transport layer protocol specific definitions,
        which are modeled as conditional packages, e.g., for OTN,
        ODUk_TTP_Pac, OCh_TTP_Pac, etc.

3.1.2. Core Foundation Module

   To communicate about an entity, it is important to have some way of
   referring to that entity, i.e., to have some way of referencing it.
   The Core Foundation module defines the artifacts for referencing
   entities; i.e.:

   -  Global Unique ID (GUID):

      An identifier that is globally unique where an identifier is a
      property of an entity/role with a value that is unique within an
      identifier space, where the identifier space is itself unique, and
      immutable. The identifier therefore represents the identity of the

Internet-Draft   Usage of an IM for network topology          July 2015


      entity/role. An identifier carries no semantics with respect to
      the purpose of the entity.)

   -  Local ID:

      An identifier that is unique in the context of some scope that is
      less than the global scope (where an identifier is as defined in
      GUID above).

   -  Name:

      A property of an entity with a value that is unique in some
      namespace but may change during the life of the entity. A name
      carries no semantics with respect to the purpose of the entity.

   -  Label:

      A property of an entity with a value that is not expected to be
      unique and is allowed to change. A label carries no semantics with
      respect to the purpose of the entity and has no effect on the
      entity behavior or state.

   The Core Foundation module also provides the opportunity to extend
   any entity using the Extension structure.

   The module also defines two foundation object classes:

   -  GlobalClass:

      Super class of object classes for which their instances can exist
      on their own right, e.g. NE, LTP, FD, Link, and FC. Global classes
      shall have one and only one globally unique identifier (GUID) and
      may have zero or more local identifiers, zero or more names, zero
      or more labels, zero or more extensions.

   -  LocalClass:

      Super class of object classes for which the existence of their
      instances depends on instances of global classes; e.g., LP (of
      LTP), EP (of FC), and LE (of Link). Local classes shall have at

      least one local identifier, may have zero or more names, zero or
      more labels, zero or more extensions.

   The Core Foundation module also defines a State_Pac artifact, which
   is a package of state attributes. The State_Pac is inherited by
   GlobalClass and LocalClass object classes. The State_Pac consists of
   the following state-related attributes:

              Figure 4-1 Overview of the CNM Topology Subset

4.1. Object Classes of the CNM Topology Subset

   This section describes the object classes of the Topology Subset of
   the CNM. Relationships between these classes are described in section
   4.2 below

4.1.1. LogicalTerminationPoint (LTP) and LayerProtocol (LP)

   The LogicalTerminationPoint (LTP) object class encapsulates the
   termination, adaptation and OAM functions of one or more transport
   protocol layers. The structure of the LTP supports all transport
   protocols including circuit and packet forms. Each transport layer is
   represented by a LayerProtocol (LP) instance. The LayerProtocol
   instances of the LTP can be used for controlling the termination and
   OAM functionality of that layer. It can also be used for controlling
   the adaptation (i.e. encapsulation and/or multiplexing of client
   signal). Where the client/server relationship is fixed 1:1 and
   immutable, the different layers can be encapsulated in a single LTP
   instance. Where there is a n:1 relationship between client and
   server, the layers must be split over separate instances of LTP.

   The LP object class is defined with generic attributes
   ''layerProtocolName'' for indicating the supported transport layer
   protocol.

Internet-Draft   Usage of an IM for network topology          July 2015


   Transport layer specific properties (such as layer-specific
   termination and adaptation properties) are modeled as attributes of
   conditional packages (called ''_Pacs'' in the UML notation of the
   ONF-CIM) associated with the LP object class.

4.1.2. ForwardingDomain (FD)

   The ForwardingDomain (FD) object class models the switching and
   routing capabilities (see ''subnetwork'' topological component in
   [G.852.2] and [TMF612]), which is used to effect forwarding of
   transport characteristic information and offers the potential to
   enable forwarding. It represents the resource that supports flows
   across the FD. The FD object can hold zero or more instances of
   ForwardingConstruct (FC) (representing constrained forwarding, not
   discussed further in this document, covering connections, VLANs etc)
   of one or more layer networks; e.g., OCh, ODU, ETH, and MPLS-TP. The
   FD object provides the context for operations that
   create/modify/delete FCs.

   The FD object class supports a recursive aggregation relationship
   such that the internal construction of an FD can be exposed as
   multiple lower level FDs and associated Links (partitioning) (see
   section 4.2.1.)

   At the lowest level of recursion, a FD (within a network element)
   could represent a switch matrix (i.e., a fabric).

   Note that an NE can encompass multiple switch matrices (FDs), as
   described in section 4.2.2. An instance of FD is associated with zero
   or more LTP objects, as described in section 4.2.3.

4.1.3. Link and Link End (LE)

   The Link object class models the adjacency between two or more
   ForwardingDomains (FDs).

   In its basic form (i.e., point-to-point Link) it associates a set of
   LTP clients on one FD with an equivalent set of LTP clients on
   another FD. Like the FC, the Link has endpoints (LinkEnd) which take
   roles in the context of the function of the Link. A point-to-point
   Link can be a TE Link and support parameters such as capacity, delay

Internet-Draft   Usage of an IM for network topology          July 2015


   etc. These parameters depend on the type of technology that supports
   the link.

   A Link can be terminated on two or more FDs. This provides support
   for technologies such as PON and Layer 2 MAC in MAC configurations.

   The LinkEnd further details the relationship between FD and Link for
   asymmetric cases.

   A FD may aggregate Links (see section 4.2.5).

   The Link can support multiple transport layers via the associated LTP
   object. An instance of Link can be formed with the necessary
   properties according to the degree of virtualization. For
   implementation optimization, multiple layer-specific links can be
   merged and represented as a single Link instance.

4.1.4. Network Element (NE)

   The NetworkElement (NE) object class represents a network element
   (traditional NE) in the data plane or a virtual network element
   visible in an interface where virtualization is used.

   In the direct interface from a SDN controller to a network element in
   the data plane, the NE object defines the scope of control for the
   resources within the network element, e.g., internal transfer of user
   information between the external terminations (ports), encapsulation,
   multiplexing/demultiplexing, and OAM functions, etc. The NE provides
   the scope of the naming space for identifying objects representing
   the resources within the network element.

   Where virtualization is employed, the NE object represents a virtual
   NE (VNE). The mapping of the VNE to the NEs is the internal matter of
   the SDN controller that offers the view of the VNE. Via the interface
   between hierarchical SDN controllers, NE instances can be created (or
   deleted) for providing (or removing) virtual views of the combination
   of slices of network elements in the data plane.

             Figure 4-2 ForwardingDomain recursion with Links

   Figure 4-2 shows a UML fragment including the Link and
   ForwardingDomain (FD). For simplicity it is assumed here that the
   Links and FDs are for a single LayerProtocol (LP) although it can be
   seen from the detailed figure earlier in this section that both a FD
   and link can support a list of LPs.

   The pictorial form shows a number of instances of FD interconnected
   by Links and shows nesting of FDs. The recursive aggregation
   "HigherLevelFdEncompassesLowerLevelFds" relationship (represented by
   an open diamond) supports the FD nesting but it should be noted that
   this is intentionally showing no lifecycle dependency between the
   lower FDs and the higher ones that nest them (to do this composition,
   a black diamond would have been used instead of the open diamond).
   This is to allow for rearrangements of the FD hierarchy (e.g. when
   regions of a network are split or merged). This emphasizes that the
   nesting is an abstraction rather than decomposition. The underlying
   network still operates regardless of how it is perceived in terms of
   aggregating FDs. The model allows for only one hierarchy.

   Aggregation)

   Figure 4-3 above shows an overlay of NetworkElement (NE) on the
   ForwardingDomains and a corresponding fragment of UML showing only
   the ForwardingDomain and NetworkElement classes.

   The figure emphasizes that one level of abstraction of
   ForwardingDomain is bounded by an NE. This is represented in the UML
   fragment by the composition association (black diamond) that explains
   that there is a lifecycle dependency in that the ForwardingDomain at
   this level that cannot exist without the NE. The figure also shows
   that a ForwardingDomain need not be bounded by an NE (as explained in
   the UML fragment by the 0..1 composition) and that a ForwardingDomain
   may have smaller scope than the whole NE (even when considering only
   a single LayerProtocol as described below).

   In one of the cases depicted (e.g., the right hand side NE
   encompassing two FDs), the two ForwardingDomains in the NE are
   completely independent. In the other cases depicted (e.g., the left
   hand side NE encompassing three FDs) the subordinate
   ForwardingDomains are themselves joined by Links emphasizing that the
   NE does not necessarily represent the lowest level of relevant
   network decomposition.

   The figure also emphasizes that just because one ForwardingDomain at
   a particular level of decomposition of the network happens to be the
   one bounded by an NE does not mean that all ForwardingDomains at that
   level are also bounded by NEs.

4.2.3. ForwardingDomain association with LTPs (FdAggregatesLtps
   Composition)

   An instance of FD is associated with zero or more LTP objects via the
   "FdAggregatesLtps" composition.

4.2.4. ForwardingDomain aggregating Links (FdEncompassesLinks)

   A ForwardingDomain can aggregate links. An example of
   ForwardingDomain Recursive Aggregation with Links is shows in section
   4.2.1 above.

   association can be inferred from the

   higherLevelFdContainsLowerLevelFd association together with the
   linkHasAssociatedFds association.

4.2.5. ForwardingDomain aggregating NEs

   A ForwardingDomain can aggregate Network Elements. An example of
   ForwardingDomain Recursive Aggregation with Links and NEs is shown in
   section 4.2.2 above.

   However, the FdAggregatesNe association is not modeled because this
   association can be inferred from higherLevelFdContainsLowerLevelFd
   association and together with the NeEncompassesFd association.

5. Detailed Description of the Topology Subset

   The two key classes related to Topology are the ForwardingDomain (FD)
   and the Link. For simple cases the FD represents the switching
   capability in the network and the Link represents adjacency. These
   are depicted in the context of other model classes in Figure 5-1.

    Figure 5-1 Object Classes and Relationships in the Topology Subset

   Figure 5-1 shows a lightweight view of the model omitting the
   attributes (where appropriate these will be described later in this
   section).

   The FD and Link will be described in detail later in the document.
   Figure 5-1 focuses on interrelationships and these will be the focus
   of this section. The figure shows that:

     -  An FD may be a subordinate part of a NetworkElement (NE) or may
        be larger than, and independent of, any NE.

     -  An FD may encompass lower level FDs. This may be such that:

          o  A FD directly contained in an NE is divided into smaller
             parts

          o  A FD not encompassed by an NE is divided into smaller
             parts some of which may be encompassed by NEs

          o  The FD represents the whole network

     -  An FD encompasses Links that interconnect any FDs encompassed
        by the FD

     -  A Link may aggregate Links in several ways

          o  In parallel where several links are considered as one

          o  In series where Links chain to form a Link of a greater
             span

               . Note that this case requires further development in
                  the model

     -  A Link has associated FDs that it interconnects

          o  A Link may interconnect 2 or more FDs

               . Note that it is usual for a Link to interconnect 2 FDs
                  but there are cases where many FDs may be
                  interconnected by a Link

     -  A Link has LinkEnds (LE)that represent the ports of the Link
        itself

          o  LEs are especially relevant for multi-ended asymmetric
             Link

     -  An LE aggregates LogicalTerminationPoints (LTPs) that bound the
        Link. The LTP represent a stack LayerProtocol terminations
        where the details of each is held in the LayerProtocol (LP).
        The LTP may be:

          o  Part of an NE

          o  Conceptually independent from any NE

     -  An LE references LTPs on which the Link associated to the LE
        terminates

   Both the Link and FD are TopologicalEntities (an abstract class, i.e.
   a class that will never instantiate) and hence they can acquire
   contents from the conditional packages (_Pacs). The conditional
   packages provide all key topology properties.

5.1. Topological Entity

   As noted in the previous section the two key topology classes are
   Forwarding Domain (FD) and Link (L).

   The FD topological component is used to show the potential to enable
   forwarding. At the lowest level of recursion, an FD (within a network
   element (NE)) represents a switch matrix (e.g., a fabric). Note that
   an NE can encompass multiple switch matrices (FDs).

   As noted earlier the Link models adjacency between two or more
   Forwarding Domains (FD).

Internet-Draft   Usage of an IM for network topology          July 2015


   Both the link and the FD have the potential to handle more than one
   layerProtocol (both have a layerProtocolNameList attribute).

   As shown in Figure 5-1 an object class ''TopologicalEntity'' has been
   defined to collect topology-related properties (characteristics etc.)
   that are common for FD and Link.

   A TopologicalEntity is an abstract representation of the emergent
   effect of the combined functioning of an arrangement of components
   (running hardware, software running on hardware, etc). The effect can
   be considered as the realization of the potential for apparent
   communication adjacency for entities that are bound to the
   terminations at the boundary of the TopologicalEntity.

   The TopologicalEntity enables the creation of constrained forwarding
   to achieve the apparent adjacency. The apparent adjacency has
   intended performance degraded from perfect adjacency and a statement
   of that degradation is conveyed via the attributes of the packages
   associated with this class. In the model both ForwardingDomain and
   Link are TopologicalEntities.

   This abstract class is used as a modeling approach to apply packages
   of attributes to both Link and ForwardingDomain. Link and
   ForwardingDomain are the key TopologicalEntities.

5.2. Characteristics of Topological Entity

   As noted above the characteristic of a TopologicalEnity are covered
   by the conditional packages (_PACs).

5.2.1. Risk (RiskParameter_Pac)

   The risk characteristics of a TopologicalEntity come directly from
   the underlying physical realization.

   The risk characteristics propagate from the physical realization to
   the client and from the server layer to the client layer, this
   propagation may be modified by protection.

   A TopologicalEntity may suffer degradation or failure as a result of
   a problem in a part of the underlying realization.

   The realization can be partitioned into segments which have some
   relevant common failure modes.

   There is a risk of failure/degradation of each segment of the
   underlying realization.

   Each segment is a part of a larger physical/geographical unit that
   behaves as one with respect to failure (i.e. a failure will have a
   high probability of impacting the whole unit (e.g. all fibers in the
   same cable).

   Disruptions to that larger physical/geographical unit will impact
   (cause failure/errors to) all TopologicalEntities that use any part
   of that larger physical/geographical entity.

   Any TopologicalEntity that uses any part of that larger
   physical/geographical unit will suffer impact and hence each
   TopologicalEntity shares risk.

   The identifier of each physical/geographical unit that is involved in
   the realization of each segment of a Topological entity can be listed
   in the RiskParameter_Pac of that TopologicalEntity.

   A segment has one or more risk characteristic.

   Shared risk between two TopologicalEntities compromises the integrity
   of any solution that use one of those TopologicalEntity as a backup
   for the other.

   Where two TopologicalEntities have a common risk characteristic they
   have an elevated probability of failing simultaneously compared to
   two TopologicalEntities that do not share risk characteristics.

     -  riskCharacteristicList: A list of risk characteristics
        (RiskCharacteristic) for consideration in an analysis of shared
        risk. Each element of the list represents a specific risk
        consideration.

     -  RiskCharacteristic: The information for a particular risk
        characteristic where there is a list of risk identifiers
        related to that characteristic. It includes:

          o  riskCharacteristicName: The name of the risk
             characteristic. The characteristic may be related to a

             specific degree of closeness. For example a particular
             characteristic may apply to failures that are localized
             (e.g. to one side of a road) where as another
             characteristic may relate to failures that have a broader
             impact (e.g. both sides of a road that crosses a bridge).
             Depending upon the importance of the traffic being routed
             different risk characteristics will be evaluated.

          o  riskIdentifierList: A list of the identifiers of each
             physical/geographic unit (with the specific risk
             characteristic) that is related to a segment of the
             TopologicalEntity.

5.2.2. TransferCost_Pac

   The cost characteristics of a TopologicalEntity not necessarily
   correlated to the cost of the underlying physical realization.

   They may be quite specific to the individual TopologicalEntity e.g.
   opportunity cost. Relates to layer capacity

   There may be many perspectives from which cost may be considered for
   a particular TopologicalEntity and hence many specifc costs and
   potentially cost algorithms.

   Using an entity will incur a cost.

     -  costCharcteristicList: The list of costs (CostCharacteristic)
        where each cost relates to some aspect of the Link

          o  CostCharcteristic: The information for a particular cost
             characteristic

               . costName: The cost characteristic will related to some
                  aspect of the TopologicalEntity (e.g. $ cost, routing
                  weight). This aspect will be conveyed by the costName

               . costValue: The specific cost.

               . costAlgorithm: The cost may vary based upon some
                  properties of the TopologicalEntity. The rules for the
                  variation are conveyed by the costAlgorithm.

5.2.3. TransferTiming_Pac

   A link will suffer effects from the underlying physical realization
   related to the timing of the information passed by the link.

     -  fixedLatencyCharacteristic: A TopologicalEntity suffers delay
        caused by the realization of the servers (e.g. distance
        related; FEC encoding etc.) along with some client specific
        processing. This is the total average latency effect of the
        TopologicalEntity

     -  jitterCharacteristic: High frequency deviation from true
        periodicity of a signal and therefore a small high rate of
        change of transfer latency. Applies to TDM systems (and not
        packet).

     -  wanderCharacteristics: Low frequency deviation from true
        periodicity of a signal and therefore a small low rate of
        change of transfer latency. Applies to TDM systems (and not
        packet).

     -  queuingLatencyList: The effect on the latency of a queuing
        process. This only has significant effect for packet based
        systems and has a complex characteristic (QueuingLatency).

          o  QueuingLatency: Provides information on latency
             characteristic for a particular stated trafficProperty.

5.2.4. TransferIntegrity_Pac

   Transfer integrity characteristic covers expected (specified) error,
   loss and duplicaion signal content as well as any damage of any form
   to total link and to the client signals.

     -  errorCharacteristic: describes the degree to which the signal
        propagated can be errored. Applies to TDM systems as the

        errored signal will be propagated and not packet as errored
        packets will be discarded.

     -  lossCharacteristic: Describes the acceptable characteristic of
        lost packets where loss may result from discard due to errors
        or overflow. Applies to packet systems and not TDM (as for TDM
        errored signals are propagated unless grossly errored and
        overflow/underflow turns into timing slips).

     -  repeatDeliveryCharacteristic: Primarily applies to packet
        systems where a packet may be delivered more than once (in
        fault recovery for example). It can also apply to TDM where
        several frames may be received twice due to switching in a
        system with a large differential propagation delay.

     -  deliveryOrderCharacteristic: Describes the degree to which
        packets will be delivered out of sequence. Does not apply to
        TDM as the TDM protocols maintain strict order.

     -  unavailableTimeCharacteristic: Describes the duration for which
        there may be no valid signal propagated.

     -  serverIntegrityProcessCharacteristic: Describes the effect of
        any server integrity enhancement process on the characteristics
        of the TopologicalEntity.

5.2.5. TransferCapcity_Pac

   The TopologicalEntity derives capacity from the underlying
   realization.

   A TopologicalEntity may be an abstraction and virtualization of a
   subset of the underlying capability offered in a view or may be
   directly reflecting the underlying realization.

   A TopologicalEntity may be directly used in the view or may be
   assigned to another view for use.

   The clients supported by a multi-layer TopologicalEntity may interact
   such that the resources used by one client may impact those available
   to another. This is derived from the LTP spec details.

   A TopologicalEntity represents the capacity available to user
   (client) along with client interaction and usage.

   A TopologicalEntity may reflect one or more client protocols and one
   or more members for each profile.

     -  totalPotentialCapacity: A ''best case'' view of the capacity of
        the TopologicalEntity assuming that any shared capacity is
        available to be taken.

   Note that this area is still under development to cover concepts such
   as:

     -  exclusiveCapacityList: The capacity allocated to this
        TopologicalEntity for its exclusive use

     -  sharedCapacityList: The capacity allocated to this
        TopologicalEntity that is not exclusively available as it is
        shared with others.

     -  assignedAsExclusiveCapacityList: The capacity assigned from
        this TopologicalEnity to another TopologicalEntity for its
        exclusive use

     -  assignedAsSharedCapacityList: The capacity assigned to one or
        more other TopologicalEntities for shared use where the
        interaction follows some stated algorithm.

     -  Capacity which includes:

          o  totalSize

          o  numberOfUsageInstances

          o  maximumUsageSize

          o  numberingRange

5.2.6. Validation_Pac

   Validation covers the various adjacenct discovery and reachability
   verification protocols. Also may cover Information source and degree
   of integrity.

     -  validationMechanismList: Provides details of the specific
        validation mechanism(s) used to confirm the presence of an
        intended topologicalEntity.

5.2.7. LayerProtocolTransition_Pac

   Relevant for a Link that is formed by abstracting one or more LTPs
   (in a stack) to focus on the flow and deemphasize the protocol
   transformation.

   This abstraction is relevant when considering multi-layer routing.

   The layer protocols of the LTP and the order of their application to
   the signal is still relevant and need to be accounted for. This is
   derived from the LTP spec details.

   This Pac provides the relevant abstractions of the LTPs and provides
   the necessary association to the LTPs involved.

   Links that included details in this Pac are often referred to as
   Transitional Links.

     -  transitionedLayerProtocolList: Provides the ordered structure
        of layer protocol transitions encapsulated in the
        TopologicalEntity. The ordering relates to the LinkEnd role.

6. Usage of the CNM Topology Subset regarding TE Topology DM

   As discussed earlier, a data model (DM) may be derived from an IM.
   It is possible to leverage the CNM Topology Subset to assess the
   consistency and completeness of related YANG modules under
   development. Appendix A provides a simple example of such a
   derivation.

7. Security Considerations

   This informational document is intended only to provide a description
   of an interface-protocol-neutral information model, and the security
   concerns are therefore out of the scope of this document.

8. IANA Considerations

   This document includes no request to IANA.

9. Conclusions

   The information model described in this draft, which is relevant to
   Network Topology [ONF TR-512], can be leveraged in assessing the
   consistency and completeness of related YANG modules under
   development.

   Shown below is the YANG specification for the Link object class. To
   also illustrate the concept of pruning (see [I-D.betts-netmod-

   object class (see Section 5.2) defined in the ONF-CIM CNM are taken
   for mapping to YANG.
