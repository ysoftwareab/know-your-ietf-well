                  Attestation Results for Connectivity
                 draft-voit-rats-attestation-results-00

Abstract

   This document defines reusable Attestation Result information
   elements.  When these elements are offered to Relying Parties as
   Evidence, different aspects of Attester trustworthiness can be
   evaluated.  Additionally, where the Relying Party is interfacing with
   a heterogenous mix of Attesting Environment and Verifier types,
   consistent policies can be applied to subsequent information exchange
   between each Attester and the Relying Party.

1.  Introduction

   The Remote ATtestation procedureS (RATS) architecture
   [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture] defines conceptual messages conveyed
   between architectural subsystems to support trustworthiness

   appraisal.  Within RATS, the Attestation Results conceptual message
   consists of "output generated by a Verifier, typically including
   information about an Attester, where the Verifier vouches for the
   validity of the results".

   Generated Attestation Results are ultimately conveyed to one or more
   Relying Parties.  Reception of an Attestation Result enables a
   Relying Party to determine what action to take with regards to an
   Attester.  Frequently, this action will be to choose whether to allow
   the Attester to interact with the Relying Party over a connection
   between the two.

   When determining whether to allow connectivity-based interactions
   with an Attester, a Relying Party is challenged with a number of
   difficult problems which it must be able to handle successfully.
   These problems include:

   o  What types of Attestation Results (AR) might a Relying Party be
      willing to trust from a specific type of Verifier?

   o  What supplemental information must the Verifier need to include
      within Attestation Results to convince a Relying Party to allow
      interactions, or to apply policies to any connections, based on
      these Attestation Results?

   o  What are the operating/environmental realities of the Attesting
      Environment where a Relying Party should only be able to associate
      a certain confidence regarding Attestation Results out of the
      Verifier?  (In other words, different types of Trusted Execution
      Environments (TEE) need not be treated as equivalent.)

   o  How to make direct comparisons where there is a heterogeneous mix
      of Attesting Environments and Verifier types.

   To address these problems, it is important that specific Attestation
   Result information elements are framed independently of Attesting
   Environment specific constraints.  If they are not, a Relying Party
   would be forced to adapt to the syntax and semantics of many vendor
   specific environments.  This is not a reasonable ask as there can be
   many types of Attesters connecting into a Relying Party.

   The business need therefore is for common Attestation Result
   information element definitions.  With these definitions, consistent
   connectivity decisions can be made by a Relying Party where there is
   a heterogenous mix of Attesting Environment types and Verifier types.

   This document defines information elements for Attestation Results in
   a way which normalizes the trustworthiness assertions that can be

   made from a diverse set of Attesters.  Of specific focus are TPM,
   TrustZone, and SGX based Attesting Environments.  Extensions to this
   document can enable additional TEE environments and additional
   information elements to be supported.

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Terminology

   The following terms are imported from [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture]:
   Appraisal Policy for Attestation Results, Attester, Attesting
   Environment, Claims, Evidence, Relying Party, and Verifier.

   [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture] also describes topological patterns that
   illustrate the need for interoperable conceptual messages.  The two
   patterns called "background-check model" and "passport model" are
   imported from the RATS architecture and used in this document as a
   reference to the architectural concepts: Background-Check Model and
   Passport Model.

   Newly defined terms for this document:

   AR-augmented Evidence:  a bundle of Evidence which includes at least
      the following:

      1.  Verifier signed Attestation Results.  These Attestation
          Results must include a Trustworthiness Vector describing a
          Verifier's most recent appraisal of an Attester, and some
          Verifier Proof-of-Freshness (PoF).

      2.  A Relying Party PoF which is bound to the Attestation Results
          of (1) by the Attester's Attesting Environment signature.

      3.  Sufficient information to determine the elapsed interval
          between the Verifier PoF and Relying Party PoF.

   Identity Evidence:  Evidence which unambiguously identifies an
      identity.  Identity Evidence could take different forms, such as a
      certificate, or a signature which can be appraised to have only
      been generated by a specific private/public key pair.

Internet-Draft             Attestation Results                April 2021


   Trustworthiness Claim:  a specific quanta of trustworthiness which
      can be assigned by a Verifier based on its appraisal policy.

   Trustworthiness Vector:  a set of zero to many Trustworthiness Claims
      assigned during a single appraisal procedure by a Verifier using
      Evidence generated by an Attester.  The vector is included within
      Attestation Results.

2.  Attestation Results and Actions

   When a Relying Party receives Attestation Results, it will receive
   them as part of a protocol from an endpoint which expects some result
   from this communication.  Upon receipt, the Relying Party will apply
   an Appraisal Policy for Attestation Results.  This policy will
   consider the Attestation Results as well as additional information
   about the Attester and Verifier when determining what action to take.

2.1.  Attestation Results for Connectivity

   When the action is a communication establishment attempt with an
   Attester, there is only a limited set of actions which a Relying
   Party might take.  These actions include:

   o  Allow or deny information exchange with the Attester (i.e.,
      connectivity).  When there is a deny, reasons should be returned
      to the Attester.

   o  Connect the Attester to a specific context within a Relying Party.

   o  Apply policies on the connection to or from the Attester (e.g.,
      rate limits).

   There are three categories of information which must be conveyed to
   the Relying Party before it determines which of these actions to
   take.

   1.  Non-repudiable Identity Evidence - Evidence which undoubtably
       identifies one or more entities involved with a connection.

   2.  Trustworthiness Claims - Specifics a Verifier asserts with
       regards to its trustworthiness findings about an Attester.

   3.  Claim Freshness - Establishes the time of last update (or
       refresh) of Trustworthiness Claims.

   The following sections detail requirements for these three
   categories.

Internet-Draft             Attestation Results                April 2021


2.2.  Non-repudiable Identity

   Identity Evidence must be conveyed during the establishment of any
   trust-based relationship.  Specific use cases will define the minimum
   types of identities required by a particular Relying Party.  At
   minimum, a Relying Party MUST able to verify the identity of a
   Verifier it chooses to trust.  This Identity Evidence will often
   consist of a Verifier signature aross the Attestation Results; and
   this signature could only have come from a key pair maintained by a
   trusted developer or operator of the Verifier.  Also at minimum for
   connectivity related relationships, each set of Attestation Results
   must be provably and non-reputably bound to the identity of the
   specific Attesting Environment.

   In a subset of use cases, these two pieces of Identity Evidence may
   be sufficient for a Relying Party to successfully meet the criteria
   for its Appraisal Policy for Attestation Results.  In this case a
   Relying Party will simply connect to any device successfully
   appraised and verified by a Verifier.  However where the Appraisal
   Policy for Attestation Results is more nuanced, the Relying Party may
   need additional information.  Some Identity Evidence related
   questions which the Relying Party may consider include:

   o  Does the Relying Party only trust this Verifier to make
      Trustworthiness Claims on behalf a specific type of hardware
      rooted Attesting Environment?  Might a mix of Verifiers be
      necessary to cover all mandatory Trustworthiness Claims?

   o  Does the Relying Party only accept connections from a verified-
      authentic software build from a specific software developer?

   o  Does the Relying Party only accept connections from specific
      preconfigured list of Attesters?

   For any of these more nuanced appraisals, additional Identity
   Evidence or other policy related information must be conveyed or pre-
   provisioned during the formation of a trust context between the
   Relying Party, the Attester, the Attester's Attesting Environment,
   and the Verifier.

2.2.1.  Verifier

   For the Verifier identity, it is important to review the chain of
   trust for that Verifier.  Additionally, the Relying Party must have
   confidence that the Trustworthiness Claims being relied upon from the
   Verifier considered the chain of trust for the Attesting Environment
   .

Internet-Draft             Attestation Results                April 2021


2.2.2.  Attesting Environment

   For the Attesting Environment identity, there MUST exist a chain of
   trust ultimately bound to a hardware-based root of trust in the
   Attesting Environment.  It is upon this root of trust that unique,
   non-repudiable identities may be founded.  Example attested
   identities may include:

   o  a type of hardware chip used for the Attesting Environment

   o  a specific instance of a running Attesting Environment

   o  a software build executing within an Attesting Environment

   o  the developer(s) responsible for the code executing within an
      Attesting Environment

   This document only defines the domain of the first of these four
   identities.  The reason the first is especially important in this
   document's context is that each type of hardware chip might support a
   different set of Trustworthiness Claims.  Consequently, the Relying
   Party might require Identity Evidence which indicates of the type of
   hardware chip when it considers its Appraisal Policy for Attestation
   Results.  For more see Appendix A.

2.2.3.  Attester

   Per [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture] Section 3.3, an Attester and a
   corresponding Attesting Environment might not share common
   boundaries.  In such cases, where connections are being established
   directly to an Attester but not to the Attesting Environment, the
   Verifier must include sufficient information in the Attestation
   Results to enable the Relying Party to have confidence that the
   Attester's trustworthiness is represented by Trustworthiness Claims
   signed by the appropriate Attesting Environment.

2.2.4.  Communicating Identity

   Any of the above identities may be needed to be established by the
   Relying Party during the connectivity establishment process.

   (text below needs work)

   The mechanism for communicating the Attesting Environment identity
   (and if it is different, the Attester identity ) may be either
   implicit or explicit within an instance of Attestation Results.  An
   example of explicit communication would be to include the following
   Identity Evidence directly in the Attestation Results: a unique

Internet-Draft             Attestation Results                April 2021


   identifier for an Attesting Environment, the name of a key which can
   be provably associated with that unique identifier, and the set of
   Attestation Results are signed using that key.  An example of
   implicit communication would be to include the following Identity
   Evidence: a signature which has been made across the Attestation
   Results.  It would be then up to the Relying Party's Appraisal Policy
   for Attestation Results to verify that this signature could only have
   come from an entity having access to the associated private key.

   Note that proving identity also requires some element of freshness be
   embedded within a signed portion of the Attestation Results.  This
   element of freshness significantly reduces the identity spoofing
   risks from a replay attack.

2.3.  Trustworthiness Claims

2.3.1.  Specific Claims

   A Verifier must be able to assert different aspects of Attester
   trustworthiness.  Therefore specific Claims of Verifier appraised
   trustworthiness have been defined in this section.  These are known
   as Trustworthiness Claims.  These Trustworthiness Claims may be
   either affirming (positive) or detracting (negative).  It is these
   Trustworthiness Claims which are asserted within the Attestation
   Results produced by a Verifier.  It is out of the scope of this
   document for the Verifier to provide proof or logic on how the
   assertion was derived.

   Following are the set of Trustworthiness Claims defined within this
   document:

   +------------------------+-----------------------------+------------+

   Each type of Attesting Environment MUST be able to support one or
   more of the set of affirming Trustworthiness Claims listed above.
   Additional Trustworthiness Claims may be defined in subsequent
   documents, but the goal is to minimize these Trustworthiness Claims
   to just Verifier appaisals which are directly actionable by the
   Relying Party.

2.3.2.  Trustworthiness Vector

   Multiple Trustworthiness Claims may be asserted about an Attesting
   Environment at single point in time.  The set of Trustworthiness
   Claims inserted into an instance of Attestation Results by a Verifier
   is known as a Trustworthiness Vector.  The order of Claims in the
   vector is NOT meaningful.  A Trustworthiness Vector with no
   Trustworthiness Claims (i.e., a null Trustworthiness Vector) is a
   valid construct.  In this case, the Verifier is making no affirming
   or detracting Claims.

2.3.3.  Trustworthiness Vector for a type of Attesting Environment

   Some Trustworthiness Claims are implicit based on the underlying type
   of Attesting Environment.  Where such implicit Trustworthiness Claims
   exist, they do not have to be explicitly included in the

Internet-Draft             Attestation Results                April 2021


   Trustworthiness Vector.  However these implicit Trustworthiness
   Claims SHOULD be considered as being present by the Relying Party.

   Additionally, there are some Trustworthiness Claims which cannot be
   adequately supported by an Attesting Environment.  For example, it
   would be difficult for an Attester that includes only a TPM (and no
   other TEE) from ever having a Verifier appraise support for 'runtime-
   confidential'.  As such, a Relying Party would be acting properly, if
   it rejects any non-supportable Trustworthiness Claims asserted from a
   Verifier.

   As a result, the need for the ability to carry a specific
   Trustworthiness Claim will vary by the type of Attesting Environment.
   Example mappings for SGX, Trustzone, and TPMs can be seen in
   Appendix A.  (This is work in progress)

2.4.  Freshness

   (Work needed in this Section.  The intent is that all freshness
   mechanisms of [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture], Section 20 will be
   supported.)  A Relying Party will care about the recentness of
   specific Trustworthiness Claims.  And a Relying Party will often
   track when there is an Expiry of Verifier Confidence for the
   Trustworthiness Vector itself.  With connectivity related Attestation
   Results, sometimes reboot will reset various Trustworthiness Claims.
   In this case you don't have to worry about seeing the reboot itself
   as connectivity reestablishment will refresh the recentness timers.

3.  Connectivity Model

   The establishment and maintenance of a connection between an Attester
   and a Relying Party will follow the Passport Model from Section 5.1
   of [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture].  Figure 1 describes this flow of
   information using the time definitions described in
   [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture].  Corresponding messages are passed
   within an authentication framework, such the EAP protocol [RFC5247]
   over TLS [RFC8446].

                        Figure 1: Interaction Model

   Figure 1 assumes that some form of time interval tracking is possible
   between the Verifer PoF and Relying Party PoF.  However, there is a
   simplified case that does not require a Relying Party's PoF.  In that
   second variant, the Relying Party trusts that the Attester cannot be
   meaningfully changed from the outside during that interval.  Based on
   that assumption, the Relying Party PoF can be safely omitted.  In
   essence, the AR-augmented Evidence is replaced by the stand-alone
   Attestation Results.

   In the first variant illustrated in Figure 1, a Verifier B is often
   implemented as a code module within the Relying Party.  In these
   cases, the role Relying Party and the role Verifier are collapsed in
   one entity.  As a result, the entity can appraise both the
   Attestation Result parts as well as the Evidence parts of AR-
   augmented Evidence to determine whether an Attester qualifies for
   connection to the Relying Party's resources.  Appraisal policies
   define the conditions and prerequisites for when an Attester
   qualifies for connection.  In essence, an Attester has to be able to
   provide all of the mandatory affirming Trustworthiness Claims and
   none of the disqualifying detracting Trustworthiness Claims.

   More details on each interaction step are as follows.  The numbers
   used match to the numbered steps in Figure 1:

   1.  An Attester sends Evidence which is provably fresh to Verifier A
       at time(EG).  Freshness from the perspective of Verifer A MAY be
       established with Verifier PoF such as a nonce.

   2.  Verifier A appraises (1), then sends the following items back to
       that Attester within Attestation Results:

       1.  the verified identity of the Attesting Environment,

       2.  the Verifier A appraised Trustworthiness Vector of an
           Attester,

       3.  a freshness proof associated with the Attestation Results,

       4.  a Verifier signature across (2.1) though (2.3).

   3.  At time(EG') a Relying Party PoF (such as a nonce) known to the
       Relying Party is sent to the Attester.

   4.  The Attester generates and sends AR-augmented Evidence to the
       Relying Party/Verifier B.  This AR-augmented Evidence includes:

       1.  The Attestation Results from (2)

       2.  Attestation Environment signing of a hash of the Attestation
           Results plus the proof-of-freshness from (3).  This allows
           the delta of time between (2.3) and (3) to be definitively
           calculated by the Relying Party.

   5.  On receipt of (4), the Relying Party applies its Appraisal Policy
       for Attestation Results.  At minimum, this appraisal policy
       process must include the following:

       1.  Verify that (4.2) includes the nonce from (3).

       2.  Use a local certificate to validate the signature (4.1).

       3.  Verify that the hash from (4.2) matches (4.1)

       4.  Use the identity of (2.1) to validate the signature of (4.2).

       5.  Failure of any steps (5.1) through (5.4) means the link does
           not meet minimum validation criteria, therefore appraise the
           link as having a null Verifier B Trustworthiness Vector.
           Jump to step (6.1).

Internet-Draft             Attestation Results                April 2021


       6.  When there is large or uncertain time gap between time(EG)
           and time(EG'), the link should be assigned a null Verifier B
           Trustworthiness Vector.  Jump to step (6.1).

       7.  Assemble the Verifier B Trustworthiness Vector

           1.  Copy Verifier A Trustworthiness Vector to Verifier B
               Trustworthiness Vector

           2.  Add implicit Trustworthiness Claims inherent to the type
               of TEE.

           3.  Prune any unbelieveable Trustworthiness Claims

           4.  Prune any Trustworthiness Claims the Relying Party
               doesn't accept from this Verifier.

   6.  The Relying Party takes action based on Verifier B's appraised
       Trustworthiness Vector:

       1.  Allow the information exchange from the Attester into a
           Relying Party context where the Verifier B appraised
           Trustworthiness Vector includes all the mandatory affirming
           Trustworthiness Claims, and none of the disqualifying
           detracting Trustworthiness Claims.

       2.  Disallow any information exchange into a Relying Party
           context for which that Verifier B appraised Trustworthiness
           Vector not qualified.

   As link layer protocols re-authenticate, steps (1) to (2) and steps
   (3) to (6) will independently refresh.  This allows the
   Trustworthiness of Attester to be continuously re-appraised.

   Additionally, it will be common that each device on either side of a
   connection will want to attest the other.  This will be a process
   known as multual-attestation.  To support this, the process listed
   above may be run independently on each side of the connection.

  Start: Evidence received starts the generation of a new
  Trustworthiness Vector.  (e.g.,  TPM Quote Received, log received,
  or appraisal timer expired)

  Step 0: set Trustworthiness Vector = Null

  Step 1: Is there sufficient fresh signed evidence to appraise?
    (yes) - No Action
    (no) -  Goto Step 6

  Step 2: Appraise Hardware Integrity PCRs
    (if hw-verification-fail) - push onto vector, go to Step 6
      else (if hw-authentic) - push onto vector
    (if not evaluated, or insufficient data to conclude: take no action)

  Step 3: Appraise Attesting Environment identity
    (if hw-instance-recognized) - push onto vector
      else (if hw-instance-unknown) - push onto vector
    (if not evaluated, or insufficient data to conclude: take no action)

  Step 4: Appraise executable loaded and filesystem integrity
    (if executables-verified) - push onto vector
       else (if executables-fail) - push onto vector, go to Step 6
    (if file-system-anomaly) - push onto vector, go to Step 6
    (if not evaluated, or insufficient data to conclude: take no action)

  Step 5: Appraise all remaining Trustworthiness Claims and set as
          appropriate.

  Step 6: Assemble Attestation Results, and push to Attester

Appendix E.  Some issues being worked

   It is possible for a cluster/hierarchy of Verifiers to have aggregate
   AR which are perhaps signed/endorsed by a lead Verifier.  What should
   be the Proof-of-Freshness or Verifier associated with any of the
   aggregate set of Trustworthiness Claims?

   There will need to be a subsequent document which documents how these
   objects which will be translated into a protocol on a wire (e.g.  EAP
   on TLS).  Some breakpoint between what is in this draft, and what is
   in specific drafts for wire encoding will need to be determined.
   Questions like architecting the cluster/hierarchy of Verifiers fall
   into this breakdown.

   For Trustworthiness Claims such as "exectables verified", there could
   be value in identifying a specific Appraisal Policy for Attestation
   Results applied.  One way this could be done would be a URI which
   identifies this policy.  As the URI also could encode the version of
   the software, it might also act as a mechanism to signal the Relying
   Party to refresh/re-evaluate its view of Verifier A.
