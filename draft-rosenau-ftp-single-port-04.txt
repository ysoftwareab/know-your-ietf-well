Rosenau            FTP extension for IP forwarding             [Page 1]



Abstract

   The FTP protocol [1] needs two connections. A control and a data
   connection. Using networks with "port forwarding" (eg. SSH, DSL
   routers, VPN etc.) there is often only the possibility for the
   server to listen on only one TCP port. In such networks the
   traditional FTP protocol cannot be used.

   This memo describes an extension to the FTP protocol that allows the
   use of FTP using only one TCP port number for both control
   connections and passive-mode data connections.

   The extension can also be used to use the FTP protocol over network
   protocols that do not have a "port" concept (such as the NetBIOS
   protocol).

Changes in version "-01"

   - The SPDT command was no longer proposed. Instead a method using
     a special user name and password is proposed.

   - The data returned by SPSV is only valid for one connection. This
     is necessary for better resource management within the FTP server.
     version-00 did not clarify this.

   - Spelling or grammar mistakes were corrected and unclear statements
     were replaced.

Change in version "-02"

   - Added chapter 6 about implementation issues.

Change in version "-03"

   - Fixed a mistake in chapter 6

Changes in this version

   The changes in version "-04" are done because of comments of a
   third party:

   - Changed back to the SPDT variant no longer proposing the method
     using a special user name and password.
     
   - Added chapter 7 about security issues.

1.  INTRODUCTION

   To transfer data via FTP [1] you need two connections: A control
   connection and a data connection.

   In traditional FTP there are two methods to establish the data
   connection:

   1) The active method: The server establishes the data connection;
      the client must send its address to the server and listen on a
      TCP port.

   2) The passive method: The server sends its address (including
      the TCP port number) to the client, which establishes the
      connection.

   The active method requires that the client can listen for incoming
   connections and that the server can establish a connection to the
   client. The client must know its own address as it is seen by the
   server. This is not the case when the client is behind a
   firewall [3].

   The passive method requires the server to be able to listen for
   incoming TCP connections on a second port and to know its own IP
   address. If the server is behind a NAT firewall with TCP port
   forwarding this is often not the case.

   Both variants do originally only work with IPv4; FTP using other
   network protocols requires special extensions such as the "EPRT" [4]
   or the "LPRT" [2] command. Both extensions do not work with
   protocols that do not have a "port" concept (such as NetBIOS).

   This draft describes an extension to the FTP protocol that allows
   using FTP with TCP port forwarding ("IP forwarding") or network
   protocols that do not have a "port" concept.

2.  OVERVIEW

   The reason for the problems described above is the fact that either
   the server or the client must know its own network address (this
   includes the port number when using TCP) and tell it to the other
   side. The server needs a second address (in the case of TCP a second
   port) if using passive mode. This can be a problem when using TCP
   port forwarding. (Note that in this case neither of the two
   computers knows its own address and port number.)

   The extension proposed here allows the server to use the same
   address (and port number) for a passive mode data connection as it
   is used for a control connection.

   To establish the data connection the client establishes a second
   connection to the same port that is used for the control connection
   and tells the server that it desires to establish a data connection.

   Because the client already knows the address and port number of the
   control connection (it would not have been able to connect
   otherwise) neither the server nor the client need to know its own
   address nor its port number.

3.  EXTENSION COMMAND ADDED

      USE SINGLE PORT PASSIVE MODE ("SPSV" proposed)

         This command is sent by the client to indicate that it wants
         to use the method described in this document to establish a
         data connection. The command has no parameter.

         If the command succeeds the server will reply

             227 Any informational text (identifier)

         The user name and the password in brackets are used to
         establish a data connection. An implementation may use a
         common user name for all data connections and the password as
         a connection identifier that will identify this control
         connection.

         Unlike the "PASV" command the data replied by "SPSV" is only
         valid for one data connection. After establishing a data
         connection "SPSV" must be sent again to get a new identifier
         before establishing a new data connection. This is necessary
         to allow the server to implement the "Service not ready"
         behaviour as it is described below.

         The identifier MUST NOT contain brackets, colons or characters
         above 126 or below 33. The identifier must not be longer than
         32 characters. The identifier is case-sensitive.

      ESTABLISHING A DATA CONNECTION ("SPDT" proposed)

         This command is the only command sent over the data
         connection. It is sent instead of a "USER" command. The server
         should be prepared to accept the command instead of the "PASS"
         command or directly after the "PASS" command because some FTP
         proxy servers require sending an USER/PASS combination before
         establishing a connection.

         The argument is the identifier received in the answer to the
         "use singe port passive mode" command.

         If the server accepted the command it returns EXACTLY the
         following sequence:

             200<SP>DATA<CR><LF>

         After transmitting this sequence the former control connection
         becomes the new data connection.

         If the identifier was not correct the server returns a reply
         with the code 504 and drops the TCP connection.


4.  EXAMPLE TRANSMISSION SCENARIO

   - The control connection ("--1-->") is established.
     S--1-->C   220 FTP server ready<CRLF>
     C--1-->S   USER u001<CRLF>
     S--1-->C   331 Enter password<CRLF>
     C--1-->S   PASS xyz<CRLF>
     S--1-->C   230 You are logged in<CRLF>
     C--1-->S   SPSV<CRLF>
     S--1-->C   227 Entering single-port mode (xYab1234)<CRLF>
   - The data connection ("---2->") is established
     S---2->C   220 FTP server ready<CRLF>
     C---2->S   SPDT xYab1234<CRLF>
     S---2->C   200 DATA<CRLF>
     C--1-->S   RETR contents.txt<CRLF>
     S--1-->C   150 Transmitting data<CRLF>
     S---2->C   (Contents of contents.txt)
   - The server closes the data connection ("---2->")
     S--1-->C   226 Data transferred<CRLF>
     ...

5.  THE "SERVICE NOT READY" MESSAGE

   If there are too many control connections open many FTP servers deny
   new users to connect to the server. The server sends the following
   message:
       120 Too many users connected. Try later.<CRLF>
   and drops the connection.

   If a client sent an "SPSV" command but did not establish a data
   connection, yet, this is not possible. In this case the following
   behaviour is proposed:
      <--- 220 Too many users; only SPSV connections allowed<CRLF>
      ---> SPDT xYz1234<CRLF>
      <--- 200 DATA<CRLF>
   or with a real user name:
      <--- 220 Too many users; only SPSV connections allowed<CRLF>
      ---> USER u001<CRLF>
      <--- 421 Too many users connected. Try later.<CRLF>


6.  POSSIBLE IMPLEMENTATION

   In many implementations a new process is started everytime a
   connection to the FTP service port is opened. The "inetd" service
   on UNIX operating systems is an example for this behavior.

   Adding the "SPSV" option to existing FTP server programs may be
   done by implementing two extensions:

   Extension behavior on SPSV)
     The "SPSV" command behaves like the "PASV" command with the
     exception that the format of the response is different. Example:
       --> SPSV<CRLF>
         (Server is actually doing "PASV"; TCP port is 12345 in this
         example; the response differs from "PASV":)
       <-- 227 Entering single-port mode (12345)<CRLF>



Rosenau            FTP extension for IP forwarding             [Page 7]


   Extension behaviour on SPDT)
     The SPDT command is used to create a tunneling connection to a
     port number given in the argument. Example:
       <-- 220 FTP server ready<CRLF>
       --> SPDT 80<CRLF>
         (Server tries to establish a connection to localhost:80
         which is actually the HTTP server)
       <-- 200 DATA<CRLF>
         (Server is simply "tunneling" the data between the two
         TCP connections)
       --> GET /index.html<CRLF><CRLF>
       <-- HTTP/1.0 200 OK<CRLF>
       <-- Content-type: text/html<CRLF>
       <-- <CRLF><CRLF>
       <-- <<HTML>>
       <-- Hello world!
       <-- <</HTML>>

   This simple way of implementing the extensions would make it easy to
   bypass server security systems such as firewalls. To avoid this such
   an implementation should first check if the port number given by the
   "SPDT" argument really is used by the FTP service.


7.  SECURITY ISSUES

   This extension can be combined with any other FTP extension.
   Therefore all security extensions of FTP can be combined with this
   extension.

   Extensions that normally would transfer data over the data
   connection after it has been established will transfer their data
   after receiving the "200 DATA<CRLF>" characters.
   
   When using an implementation that is based on tunneling (as
   described in chapter 6) the process receiving a "SPDT" command
   should not allow a tunneling connection to a non-FTP process.
   Using non-TCP/IP connections (e.g. AF_UNIX) for tunneling could make
   this easier.

   The "identifier" should contain information that is really needed
   for establishing the connection (such as the port number in the
   example in chapter 6) as well as a random number cookie that is used
   to verify if the identifier is really valid. The SPDT command will
   check if the random number part in the identifier matches the one
   generated by the SPSV command.
   
   The port number should also not be included directly in the
   identifier but it should only be transferred encrypted or indirectly
   (e.g. file name of a temporary file containing the port number).
   The "file name" variant would also ensure that SPDT can only tunnel
   FTP connections (and not HTTP connections as shown in chapter 6.)
