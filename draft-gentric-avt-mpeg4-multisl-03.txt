Abstract 
    
   This document describes a payload format for transporting MPEG-4 
   encoded data using RTP. MPEG-4 is a recent standard from ISO/IEC for 
   the coding of natural and synthetic audio-visual data. Several 
   services provided by RTP are beneficial for MPEG-4 encoded data 
   transport over the Internet. Additionally, the use of RTP makes it 
   possible to synchronize MPEG-4 data with other real-time data types. 
    
   This specification is a product of the Audio/Video Transport working 
   group within the Internet Engineering Task Force and ISO/IEC MPEG-4 
   ad hoc group on MPEG-4 over Internet. Comments are solicited and 
   should be addressed to the working group's mailing list at rem-
   conf@es.net and/or the authors.

1. Introduction 
    
   MPEG-4 is a recent standard from ISO/IEC for the coding of natural 
   and synthetic audio-visual data in the form of audiovisual objects 
   that are arranged into an audiovisual scene by means of a scene 
   description [1][2][3][4]. This draft specifies an RTP [5] payload 
   format for transporting MPEG-4 encoded data streams. 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [6]. 
    
   The benefits of using RTP for MPEG-4 data stream transport include: 
    
   i. Ability to synchronize MPEG-4 streams with other RTP payloads 
    
   ii. Monitoring MPEG-4 delivery performance through RTCP 
    
   iii. Combining MPEG-4 and other real-time data streams received from 
   multiple end-systems into a set of consolidated streams through RTP 
   mixers 
    
   iv. Converting data types, etc. through the use of RTP translators. 
    
   1.1 Overview of MPEG-4 End-System Architecture 
    
   Fig. 1 below shows the general layered architecture of MPEG-4 
   terminals. The Compression Layer processes individual audio-visual 
   media streams. The MPEG-4 compression schemes are defined in the 
   ISO/IEC specifications 14496-2 [2] and 14496-3 [3]. The compression 
   schemes in MPEG-4 achieve efficient encoding over a bandwidth 
   ranging from several kbps to many Mbps. The audio-visual content 
   compressed by this layer is organized into Elementary Streams (ESs). 
   The MPEG-4 standard specifies MPEG-4 compliant streams. Within the 
   constraint of this compliance the compression layer is unaware of a 
   specific delivery technology, but it can be made to react to the 
   characteristics of a particular delivery layer such as the path-MTU 
   or loss characteristics. Also, some compressors can be designed to 
   be delivery specific for implementation efficiency. In such cases 
   the compressor may work in a non-optimal fashion with delivery 
   technologies that are different than the one it is specifically 
   designed to operate with. 
    
   The hierarchical relations, location and properties of ESs in a 
   presentation are described by a dynamic set of Object Descriptors 
   (ODs). Each OD groups one or more ES Descriptors referring to a 
   single content item (audio-visual object). Hence, multiple 
   alternative or hierarchical representations of each content item are 
   possible. 
    
   ODs are themselves conveyed through one or more ESs. A complete set 
   of ODs can be seen as an MPEG-4 resource or session description at a 

  
Gentric et al.            Expires July 2001                         2 

                RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams      April 2001 
 
 
   stream level. The resource description may itself be hierarchical, 
   i.e. an ES conveying an OD may describe other ESs conveying other 
   ODs. 
    
   The session description is accompanied by a dynamic scene 
   description, Binary Format for Scene (BIFS), again conveyed through 
   one or more ESs. At this level, content is identified in terms of 
   audio-visual objects. The spatio-temporal location of each object is 
   defined by BIFS. The audio-visual content of those objects that are 
   synthetic and static are described by BIFS also. Natural and 
   animated synthetic objects may refer to an OD that points to one or 
   more ESs that carries the coded representation of the object or its 
   animation data. 
    
   By conveying the session (or resource) description as well as the 
   scene (or content composition) description through their own ESs, it 
   is made possible to change portions of the content composition and 
   the number and properties of media streams that carry the audio- 
   visual content separately and dynamically at well known instants in 
   time. 
    
   One or more initial Scene Description streams and the corresponding 
   OD stream have to be pointed to by an initial object descriptor 
   (IOD). The IOD needs to be made available to the receivers through 
   some out-of-band means that are out of scope of this payload 
   specification. However in the context of transport on IP networks it 
   is defined in a separate document [9]. 
    
   A homogeneous encapsulation of ESs carrying media or control (ODs, 
   BIFS) data is defined by the Sync Layer (SL) that primarily provides 
   the synchronization between streams. The Compression Layer organizes 
   the ESs in Access Units (AU), the smallest elements that can be 
   attributed individual timestamps. Integer or fractional AUs are then 
   encapsulated in SL packets.  All consecutive data from one stream is 
   called an SL-packetized stream at this layer. The interface between 
   the compression layer and the SL is called the Elementary Stream 
   Interface (ESI). The ESI is informative. 
    
   The Delivery Layer in MPEG-4 consists of the Delivery Multimedia 
   Integration Framework defined in ISO/IEC 14496-6 [4]. This layer is 
   media unaware but delivery technology aware. It provides transparent 
   access to and delivery of content irrespective of the technologies 
   used.  The interface between the SL and DMIF is called the DMIF 
   Application Interface (DAI). It offers content location independent 
   procedures for establishing MPEG-4 sessions and access to transport 
   channels. The specification of this payload format is considered as 
   a part of the MPEG-4 Delivery Layer.

1.2 MPEG-4 Elementary Stream Data Packetization 
    
   The ESs from the encoders are fed into the SL with indications of AU 
   boundaries, random access points, desired composition time and the 
   current time. 
    
   The Sync Layer fragments the ESs into SL packets, each containing a 
   header that encodes information conveyed through the ESI. If the AU 
   is larger than a SL packet, subsequent packets containing remaining 
   parts of the AU are generated with subset headers until the complete 
   AU is packetized. 
    
   The syntax of the Sync Layer is configurable and can be adapted to 
   the needs of the stream to be transported. This includes the 
   possibility to select the presence or absence of individual syntax 
   elements as well as configuration of their length in bits. The 
   configuration for each individual stream is conveyed in a 
   SLConfigDescriptor, which is an integral part of the ES Descriptor 
   for this stream. The MPEG-4 SLConfigDescriptor, being configuration 
   information, is not carried by the media stream itself but is rather 
   transported via an ObjectDescriptor Stream encoded using the MPEG-4 
   Object Description framework. This can be done in a separate stream 
   using this payload format (see section 4.2 for details). The 
   SLConfigDescriptor MAY be transported by other means (for example as 
   a a=fmtp parameter, see section 5).

2. Analysis of the carriage of MPEG-4 over IP 
    
   When transporting MPEG-4 audio and video, applications may or may 
   not require the use of MPEG-4 systems. To achieve the highest level 
   of interoperability between all MPEG-4 applications, it is desirable 
   that (a) in both cases the same MPEG-4 transport format can be used 
   and that (b) receivers that have no MPEG-4 system knowledge can 
   easily skip the MPEG-4 system specific information, if any. 
    
   RTP is perfectly suitable to transport MPEG-4 audio and MPEG-4 
   video, but when using MPEG-4 systems a problem arises from the fact 
   that both RTP and MPEG-4 systems contain a synchronization layer. 
   In particular, the RTP header duplicates some of the information 
   provided in SL packet headers such as the composition timestamps 
   (CTSs) and the marker bit that signals the end of access units. 
    
   To avoid unnecessary overhead and potential interoperability risks 
   when transporting MPEG-4 systems, it is desirable to remove the 
   redundancy between the SL packet header and the RTP packet header. 
   To be independent on the use of MPEG-4 systems, synchronization can 
   rely on the parameters provided in the RTP header. 
    
   In case SL headers are used, the redundant fields are removed from 
   the SL header, producing "reduced SL headers". 
   The remaining information from the SL header, if any, is contained 
   inside the RTP packet payload, together with the SL packet payload. 
   The combination of RTP packet headers and reduced SL packet headers 
   can be used to logically map the RTP packets to complete SL packets. 
    
   Some of the information contained in the reduced SL headers is also 
   useful for transport over RTP when MPEG-4 systems is not used. 
    
   For that reason the information in the "reduced" SL headers is split 
   into "general useful information" and "MPEG-4 systems only 
   information". 
    
   The "general useful information" hereinafter called Mapped SL Packet 
   Header (MSLH) is carried by a number of fields configurable using 
   parameters defined in section 5.1; all receivers can parse these 
   fields. 
    
   The "MPEG-4 systems only information", if any, is contained in a 
   reduced SL header, hereinafter called Remaining SL Packet Header 
   (RSLH), also signaled by parameters (see section 5.1)and preceded by 
   a length field, so as to enable easy skipping of this information by 
   non-MPEG-4 system devices. 
    
   This is depicted in figure 2.

   Figure 2: Mapping of SL Packet into RTP packet 
    
   This RTP payload format has been designed so that it can be 
   configured (using parameters described in section 5.1) to be 
   identical to RFC 3016 for the recommended MPEG-4 video 
   configurations. Hence receivers that comply with this payload 
   specification can decode such RTP payload.  
    
3. Payload Format 
    
   The RTP Payload corresponds to an integer number of SL packets. 
    
   SL packets inside RTP packets MUST be in the SL stream order i.e: 
   i)   decodingTimeStamp order, if present 
   ii)  packetSequenceNumber order, if present 
   iii) Implicit decoding order in all other cases. 
    
   The SL Packet Headers are transformed into RSLH with some fields 
   extracted to be mapped in the RTP header and others extracted to be 
   mapped in the corresponding MSLH. The SL Packet Payload is 
   unchanged. 
    
   This payload format has two modes. The "SingleSL" mode is a mode 
   where a single SL packet is transported per RTP packet. The 
   "MultipleSL" mode is a mode where more than one SL packet are 
   transported per RTP packet. The default mode is the Single-SL mode. 
   The mode can be set to Multiple-SL by adding a non-zero SLPPSize or 
   SLPPSizeLength parameter (see section 5.1). 
    
   RTP Packets SHOULD be sent in the SL stream order (as defined 
   above). 
    
   The size (or number) of the SL packet(s) SHOULD be adjusted such 
   that the resulting RTP packet is not larger than the path-MTU. To 
   handle larger packets, this payload format relies on lower layers 
   for fragmentation, which may not be desirable.

3.1 RTP Header Fields Usage 
    
   Payload Type (PT): The assignment of an RTP payload type for this 
   new packet format is outside the scope of this document, and will 
   not be specified here. It is expected that the RTP profile for a 
   particular class of applications will assign a payload type for this 
   encoding, or if that is not done then a payload type in the dynamic 
   range shall be chosen. 
    
   Marker (M) bit: The M bit is set to 1 when all SL packets in the RTP 
   packet are Access Units ends i.e. the M bit maps to the SL 
   accessUnitEndFlag. 
    
   M is set to 1 when the RTP packet contains either: 
   . a single SL packet containing a full Access Unit 
   . a single SL packet transporting the last fragment of an Access 
   Unit 
   . multiple SL packets each containing a full Access Unit 
   . multiple SL packets each containing the last fragment of an Access 
   Unit 
   . multiple SL packets each containing either a full Access Unit or 
   the last fragment of an Access Unit 
    
   The last 2 cases occur when using specific interleaving schemes. In 
   some interleaving schemes it may not be practical to reshuffle the 
   SL packets so as to group Access Unit ends in the same RTP packet. 
   In that case, Access Unit boundaries SHOULD be transported using one 
   or both of the SL flags accessUnitStartFlag and accessUnitEndFlag. 
    
   Extension (X) bit: Defined by the RTP profile used. 
    
   Sequence Number: The RTP sequence number should be generated by the 
   sender with a constant random offset and does not have to be 
   correlated to any (optional) MPEG-4 SL sequence numbers. 
    
   Timestamp: Set to the value in the compositionTimeStamp field of the 
   first SL packet, if present. If compositionTimeStamp has less than 
   32 bits length, the MSBs of timestamp MUST be set to zero. 
    
   Although it is available from the SL configuration data, the 
   resolution of the timestamp may need to be conveyed explicitly 
   through some out-of-band means to be used by network elements which 
   are not MPEG-4 aware. 
    
   If compositionTimeStamp has more than 32 bits length, this payload 
   format cannot be used. 
    
   In all cases, the sender SHALL always make sure that RTP time stamps 
   are identical only for RTP packets transporting fragments of the 
   same Access Unit. 
    
   In case compositionTimeStamp is not present in the current SL 
   packet, but has been present in a previous SL packet the reason is 
  
Gentric et al.            Expires July 2001                         7 

                RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams      April 2001 
 
 
   that this is the same Access Unit that has been fragmented therefore 
   the same timestamp value MUST be taken as RTP timestamp. 
    
   If compositionTimeStamp is never present in SL packets for this 
   stream, the RTP packetizer SHOULD convey a reading of a local clock 
   at the time the RTP packet is created. 
    
   According to RFC1889 [5, Section 5.1] timestamps are recommended to 
   start at a random value for security reasons. However then, a 
   receiver is not in the general case able to reconstruct the original 
   MPEG-4 Time Stamps (CTS, DTS, OCR) which can be of use for 
   applications where streams from multiple sources are to be 
   synchronized. Therefore the usage of such a random offset SHOULD be 
   avoided. 
    
   Note that since RTP devices may re-stamp the stream, all time stamps 
   inside of the RTP payload (CTS and DTS in MSLH, OCR in RSLH) MUST be 
   expressed as difference to the RTP time stamp. Since this 
   subtraction may lead to negative values, the offset MUST be encoded 
   as a two's complement signed integer in network byte order. Note 
   these offsets (delta) typically require much fewer bits to be 
   encoded than the original length, which is another justification. 
 
   SSRC, CC and CSRC fields are used as described in RFC 1889 [5]. 
    
   RTCP SHOULD be used as defined in RFC 1889 [5]. 
    
   RTP timestamps in RTCP SR packets: according to the RTP timing 
   model, the RTP timestamp that is carried into an RTCP SR packet is 
   the same as the compositionTimeStamp that would be applied to an RTP 
   packet for data that was sampled at the instant the SR packet is 
   being generated and sent. The RTP timestamp value is calculated from 
   the NTP timestamp for the current time, which also goes in the RTCP 
   SR packet. To perform that calculation, an implementation needs to 
   periodically establish a correspondence between the CTS value of a 
   data packet and the NTP time at which that data was sampled. 
 
3.2 RTP payload structure 
    
   The packet payload structure consists of 3 byte-aligned sections. 
    
   The first section is the MSLHSection and contains Mapped SL Packet 
   Headers (MSLH). The MSLH structure is described in 3.3. In the 
   Single-SL mode this section is empty by default. 
    
   The second section is the RSLHSection and contains Remaining SL 
   Headers (RSLH). The RSLH structure is described in 3.5. By default 
   this section is empty. 
    
   The last section (SLPPSection) contains the SL packet payloads. This 
   section is never empty.

3.4.1 Fields of MSLH

                RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams      April 2001 
 
 
   SLPPayloadSize (SL Packet Payload Size): Indicates the size in bytes 
   of the associated SL Packet Payload, which can be found in the 
   SLPPSection of the RTP packet. The length in bits of this field is 
   signaled by the SLPPSizeLength parameter (see section 5.1). 
    
   SLPSeqNum/SLPSeqNumDelta: Encodes the packetSequenceNumber (serial 
   number) of the SL Packet. 
    
   SLPSeqNum is found only for the first SL packet. SLPSeqNumDelta is 
   optional and -if present- appears for subsequent (non-first) SL 
   packets. 
    
   The length in bits of the SLPSeqNum field is defined by the 
   SLPSeqNumLength parameter (see section 5.1). 
    
   The length in bits of the SLPSeqNumDelta field is defined by the 
   SLPSeqNumDeltaLength parameter (see section 5.1). 
    
   If the parameter SLPSeqNumDeltaLength is defined, non-first SL 
   packets have their packetSequenceNumber encoded as a difference 
   named SLPSeqNumDelta. This difference is relative to the previous SL 
   packet in the RTP packet according to (with i>=0): 
   packetSequenceNumber(0) = SLPSeqNum(0)    
   packetSequenceNumber(i+1) = packetSequenceNumber(i) + 
   SLPSeqNumDelta(i+1) + 1    
    
   If the parameter SLPSeqNumDeltaLength is not defined the default 
   value is zero i.e. the SLPSeqNumDelta field is not present for non-
   first SL packets. Furthermore receivers SHALL then apply the above 
   formula with SLPSeqNumDelta equal to zero i.e. by default 
   packetSequenceNumber is incremented by 1 for each SL packet in one 
   RTP packet. This means that for streams that use 
   packetSequenceNumber and are not interleaved the transport of 
   packetSequenceNumber in the Multiple-SL mode is "almost free". 
 
   CTSFlag (1 bit): Indicates whether the CTSDelta field is present. A 
   value of 1 indicates that the field is present, a value of 0 that it 
   is not present. 
    
   If CTSDeltaLength is not zero this field is present in all MSLH 
   since the receiver needs it to reconstruct the 
   compositionTimeStampFlag of SL Headers. 
    
   CTSDelta: Specifies the value of the CTS as a 2-complement offset 
   (delta) from the timestamp in the RTP header of this RTP packet. 
   The length in bits of each CTSDelta field is specified by the 
   CTSDeltaLength parameter (see section 5.1). 
    
   This field is present if CTSFlag is 1 except for the first MSLH 
   since the composition time stamp of the first SL packet is mapped to 
   the RTP time stamp, regardless of whether CTSFlag is 1. In all cases 
   the sender MUST remove the compositionTimeStamp from the RSLH.

                RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams      April 2001 
 
 
   DTSFlag (1 bit): Indicates whether the DTSDelta field is present. A 
   value of 1 indicates that DTSDelta is present, a value of 0 that it 
   is not present. 
    
   If DTSDeltaLength is not zero this field is present in all MSLH 
   since the receiver needs it to reconstruct the decodingTimeStampFlag 
   of SL Headers. 
    
   DTSDelta: Specifies the value of the decodingTimeStamp as a 2 
   complement offset (delta) from the timestamp in the RTP header of 
   this packet. The length in bits of each DTSDelta field is specified 
   by the DTSDeltaLength parameter (see section 5.1). 
    
   This field appears when DTSFlag is 1. The sender MUST always remove 
   the decodingTimeStamp from the RSLH. 
 
3.4.2 Relationship between sizes of MSLH fields and parameters

   Parsing of the bit-wise concatenated RSLHs requires MPEG-4 system 
   awareness, specifically it requires to understand the MPEG-4 
   Synchronization Layer (SL) syntax and the modifications to this 
   syntax described in the next section. 
    
   However thanks to the RSLHSectionSize field non-MPEG-4-system 
   receivers MAY skip this part by rounding up RSLPHSize/8 to the next 
   integer number of bytes.  
       
3.6 RSLH structure 
    
   A Remaining SL Packet Header (RSLH) is what remains of an SL header 
   after modifications for mapping into this payload format.  
    
   The following modifications of the SL packet header MUST be applied. 
   The other fields of the SL packet header MUST remain unchanged but 
   are bit-shifted to fill in the gaps left by the operations specified 
   below. 
    
3.6.1 Removal of fields 
    


  
Gentric et al.            Expires July 2001                        13 

                RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams      April 2001 
 
 
   The following SL Packet Header fields -if present- are removed since 
   they are mapped either in the RTP header or in the corresponding 
   MSLH: 
   . compositionTimeStampFlag 
   . compositionTimeStamp 
   . decodingTimeStampFlag 
   . decodingTimeStamp 
   . packetSequenceNumber 
   . AccessUnitEndFlag (in Single-SL mode only) 
    
   The AccessUnitEndFlag, when present for a given stream, MUST be 
   removed from every RSLH when using the Single-SL mode since it has 
   the same meaning as the Marker bit (and for compatibility with RFC 
   3016). However when using the Multiple-SL mode, AccessUnitEndFlag 
   MUST NOT be removed since it is useful to signal individual AU ends. 
 
3.6.2 Mapping of OCR 
    
   Furthermore if the SL Packet header contains an OCR, then this field 
   is encoded in the RSLH as a 2-complement difference (delta) exactly 
   like a compositionTimeStamp or a decodingTimeStamp in the MSLH. The 
   length in bit of this difference is indicated by the OCRDeltaLength 
   parameter (see section 5.1). 
    
   With this payload format OCRs MUST have the same clock resolution as 
   Time Stamps. 
    
   If compositionTimeStamp is not present for a SL packet that has OCR 
   then the OCR SHALL be encoded as a difference to the RTP time stamp. 
    
3.6.3 Degradation Priority 
    
   For streams that use the optional degradationPriority field in the 
   SL Packet Headers, only SL packets with the same degradation 
   priority SHALL be transported by one RTP packet so that components 
   may dispatch the RTP packets according to appropriate QOS or 
   protection schemes. Furthermore only the first RSLH of one RTP 
   packet SHALL contain the degradationPriority field since it would be 
   otherwise redundant.  
 
3.7 SLPPSection structure 
    
   The SLPPSection (SL Packet Payload Section) contains the 
   concatenated SL Packet Payloads. By definition SL Packet Payloads 
   are byte aligned. 
    
   For efficiency SL packets do not carry their own payload size. This 
   is not an issue for RTP packets that contain a single SL Packet. 
    
   However in the Multiple-SL mode the size of each SL packet payload 
   MUST be available to the receiver.

                RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams      April 2001 
 
 
   If the SL packet payload size is constant for a stream, the size 
   information SHOULD NOT be transported in the RTP packet. However in 
   that case it MUST be signaled using the SLPPSize parameter (see 
   section 5.1). 
    
   If the SL packet payload size is variable then the size of each SL 
   packet payload MUST be indicated in the corresponding MSLH. In order 
   to do so the MSLH MUST contain a SLPPayloadSize field. The number of 
   bits on which this SLPPayloadSize field is encoded MUST be indicated 
   using the SLPPSizeLength parameter (see section 5.1). 
    
   The absence of either SLPPSize or SLPPSizeLength indicates the 
   Single-SL mode i.e. that a single SL packet is transported in each 
   RTP packet for that stream.

3.8 Interleaving 
    
   SL Packets MAY be interleaved. Senders MAY perform interleaving. 
   Receivers MUST support interleaving. 
    
   When interleaving of SL packets is used it SHALL be implemented 
   using the SLPSeqNum field of MSLH. 
    
   The AUSequenceNumber field of the SL header MUST NOT be used for 
   interleaving since firstly it may collide with the Scene Description 
   Carousel usage described in section 5.1 and secondly it is not 
   visible to non-MPEG-4 system receivers. 
    
   The conjunction of RTP sequence number and SLPSeqNum can produce a 
   quasi-unique identifier for each SL packet so that a receiver can 
   unambiguously reconstruct the original order even in case of out-of-
   order packets, packet loss or duplication.

                RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams      April 2001 
 
 
    
   This section specifies rules for senders in order to prevent media 
   decoding difficulties at the receiver end. 
    
   MPEG-4 Access Units are the default fragments for MPEG-4 bitstreams 
   and SHOULD be mapped one-to-one to RTP packets of this format with 
   two exceptions: 
   - Access Units larger than the MTU, 
   - When using interleaving for better packet loss resilience. 
    
   In all cases Access Unit start MUST be aligned with SL packet start. 
    
   This section gives rules to apply when performing Access Unit 
   fragmentation. 
    
   Some MPEG-4 codecs define optional syntax for Access Units sub-
   entities (fragments) that are independently decodable for error 
   resilience purposes. Examples are Video Packets for video and Error 
   Sensitivity Categories (ESC) for audio. This always corresponds to 
   specific bitstream syntax, which is signaled in the 
   DecoderSpecificInfo inside the DecoderConfig in SLConfig, and/or 
   using the corresponding parameters as described in section 5.1. 
   Therefore encoders and decoders are both aware whether they are 
   operating in such a mode or not (however since this codec 
   configuration is an opaque data block this is not explicitly 
   signaled by this payload format). 
    
   If not operating in such a mode it is obvious that the decoder has 
   to skip packets after a loss until an Access Unit start is received. 
   Similarly decoder implementations that do not implement robust 
   decoding of Access Units fragments have to discard all packets after 
   a packet loss until an Access Unit start is received. In the same 
   way decoder implementations that do not implement re-synchronization 
   at any Access Units start have to discard all packets after a packet 
   loss until a Random Access Point Access Unit is received. 
    
   One problem would arise however for decoder implementations that try 
   to restart decoding after a packet loss if independently decodable 
   fragments are signaled (in the decoder configuration) but the 
   fragments actually received are not independently decodable because 
   the RTP sender has made RTP packets on different boundaries than the 
   fragments provided by the encoder (so this issue applies to the 
   interface between the encoder and the RTP sender and to the RTP 
   sender component itself). 
    
   For this reason the following rules must apply to SL streams that 
   are specifically made for transport with this payload format: 
    
   SL packets SHOULD be codec-semantic entities in the spirit of ALF 
   i.e. either complete Access Units or fragments of Access Units that 
   are independently decodable. Specifically when a given codec has an 
   independently decodable Access Unit fragments optional syntax this 
   option SHOULD be used.

                RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams      April 2001 
 
 
    
   Furthermore when streams are generated using independently decodable 
   Access Units fragments these Access Units fragments MUST be mapped 
   one-to-one into SL packets. Consequently independently decodable 
   Access Units fragments MUST NOT be split across several SL packets 
   and therefore MUST NOT be split across several RTP packets. 
    
   For example an MPEG-4 audio stream encoded using the ESC syntax MUST 
   NOT split one ESC across 2 RTP packets. 
    
   This rule is relaxed when using MPEG-4 Video Packets for two 
   reasons: firstly Video Packets can be much larger than typical MTU 
   and secondly all Video Packets start with a specific 
   resynchronization marker that can be unambiguously detected. 
   Therefore for video streams using the Video Packet syntax Video 
   Packets MAY be split across several SL packets although it is 
   strongly RECOMMENDED to always adapt the Video Packet size to fit 
   the MTU. A Video Packet start MUST always be aligned with a SL 
   packet start, except when a GOV is present, in which case the GOV 
   and the first Video Packet of the following VOP MUST be included in 
   the same SL packet. 
 
4. Other issues 
 
4.1 SL packetized stream reconstruction 
    
   The MPEG-4 over IP framework [9] requires that the way a receiver 
   can reconstruct a valid SL packetized stream shall be documented, 
   this is the purpose of this section. 
    
   Since this format directly transports SL packets this reconstruction 
   is trivial with the following rules: 
    
   - SLPacketHeader.packetSequenceNumber is restored from 
   MSLH.SLPSeqNum for the first SL packet in the RTP packet (i= 0): 
   SLPacketHeader.packetSequenceNumber(0) = MSLH.SLPSeqNum(0) 
   and for subsequent packets using (for i>=0) : 
   SLPacketHeader.packetSequenceNumber(i+1) = 
   SLPacketHeader.packetSequenceNumber(i) + MSLH.SLPSeqNumDelta(i+1) +1 
    
   - All time stamps (CTS, DTS, OCR), when present, are restored from 
   the delta values. 
   - Time stamps flags (CTSFlag, DTSFlag) in MSLH are used to 
   reconstruct respectively the compositionTimeStampFlag and 
   decodingTimeStampFlag of SLPacketHeader. 
    
   Specifically the reconstruction depends on the parameters as 
   follows: 
    
   If CTSDeltaLength is absent or equals 0: 
   The SL stream reconstruction rules are: 
   . for the first (or only) SL packet:  
    . if SLConfig.useTimeStamps == true, then: 
  
Gentric et al.            Expires July 2001                        17 

                RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams      April 2001 
 
 
     . SLPacketHeader.compositionTimeStampFlag = true 
     . SLPacketHeader.compositionTimeStamp = RTP TimeStamp 
    . if SLConfig.useTimeStamps == false, then: 
     . SLPacketHeader.compositionTimeStampFlag is not defined 
   . for the following SL packets: 
    . SLPacketHeader.compositionTimeStampFlag = false 
    
   If CTSDeltaLength is not zero: 
    . SLPacketHeader.compositionTimeStampFlag = MSLH.CTSFlag 
    . SLPacketHeader.compositionTimeStamp = RTP TimeStamp + 
   MSLH.CTSDelta 
    
   - The other SL packet header fields SHALL remain as found in RSLH. 
    
   It is obvious that in the general case the reconstruction of the 
   original SL packetized stream requires SL-awareness. However this 
   payload format allows in all cases a receiver that does not know 
   about the SL syntax to reconstruct the semantic of SL for the 
   following very useful features: 
   - Packet order (decoding order) 
   - Access Unit boundaries (using the M bit) 
   - Access Unit fragments (i.e. SL packet boundaries using 
   MSLH.SLPPayloadSize) 
   - Composition Time Stamps (using the RTP Time Stamp and 
   MSLH.CTSDelta) 
   - Decoding Time Stamps (using the RTP Time Stamp and MSLH.DTSDelta) 
   - Packet sequence number (using the RTP Time Sequence number and 
   MSLH.SLPSeqNum) 
 
4.2 Handling of scene description streams 
    
   MPEG-4 introduces new stream types as described in section 1 namely 
   Object Descriptors and BIFS. In the following both OD and BIFS are 
   discussed on the same basis i.e. as "scene description". 
    
   Considering Scene description as a "stream-able" type of content is 
   a rather new concept and for that reasons some specific comments are 
   needed. 
    
   Typically scene descriptions are encoded in such a way that 
   information loss would in the general case cripple the presentation 
   beyond any hope of repair by the receiver. Still this is well suited 
   for a number of multimedia applications were the scene is first made 
   available via reliable channels to the client and then played. This 
   payload format is not intended for this type of applications for 
   which download of MPEG-4 interchange (.mp4) files is typical. 
   However it can also be used if the RTP packets are transported using 
   TCP or any other reliable protocol. 
    
   On the other hand MPEG-4 has introduced the possibility to 
   dynamically change the scene description by sending animation 
   information (changes in parameters) and structural change 
   information (updates). Since this information has to be sent in a 
  
Gentric et al.            Expires July 2001                        18 

                RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams      April 2001 
 
 
   timely fashion MPEG-4 has defined a number of techniques in order to 
   encode the scene description in a manner that makes it behave 
   similarly to other temporal encoding schemes such as audio and 
   video. This payload format is intended for this usage. 
    
   Note that in many cases the application will consist of first the 
   reliable transmission of a static initial scene followed by the 
   streaming of animations and updates. For this reason the usage of 
   this payload format is attractive since it offers a unique solution. 
    
   Senders must be aware that suitable schemes should be used when 
   scene description streams transport sensitive configuration 
   information. For example in case the RTP packet transporting an OD-
   update command would be lost, the corresponding media stream would 
   not be accessible by the receiver.  
 
   Redundancy is a possibility and may either be added by tools 
   hierarchically higher than this payload format, e.g. by packet based 
   FEC, re-transmission, or similar tools. In such a case, the general 
   congestion control principles have to be observed. 
    
   Since BIFS and OD streams may be modified during the session with 
   update commands, there is a need to send both update commands and 
   full BIFS/OD refresh. For that reason MPEG-4 defines Random Access 
   Points (RAP) for scene description streams (OD and BIFS) where by 
   definition a decoder can restart decoding i.e. receives a "full 
   update" of the scene. This mechanism is called Scene and Object 
   Description Carrousel. The AU Sequence Number field of SL Packet 
   Header is used to support this behavior at the Synchronization 
   Layer. When two access units are sent consecutively with the same AU 
   Sequence Number, the second one is assumed to be a semantic 
   repetition of the first. If a receiver starts to listen in the 
   middle of a session or has detected losses, it can skip all received 
   Access Units until such a RAP. The periodicity of transmission of 
   these RAPs should be chosen/adjusted depending on the application 
   and the network it is deployed on; i.e. exactly like Intra-coded 
   frames for video, it is the responsibility of the sender to make 
   sure the periodicity of RAPs is suitable. 
 
4.3 Multiplexing 
    
   An advanced MPEG-4 session may involve a large number of objects 
   that may be as many as a few hundred, transporting each ES as an 
   individual RTP stream may not always be practical. Allocating and 
   controlling hundreds of destination addresses for each MPEG-4 
   session may pose insurmountable session administration problems. 
   The input/output processing overhead at the end-points will be 
   extremely high also. Additionally, low delay transmission of low 
   bitrate data streams, e.g. facial animation parameters, results in 
   extremely high header overheads.

                RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams      April 2001 
 
 
   To solve these problems, MPEG-4 data transport requires a 
   multiplexing scheme that allows selective bundling of several ESs. 
   This is beyond the scope of the payload format defined here. 
    
   The MPEG-4's Flexmux multiplexing scheme may be used for this 
   purpose and a specific RTP payload format is being developed [11].  
    
   Another approach may be to develop a generic RTP multiplexing scheme 
   usable for MPEG-4 data. The multiplexing scheme reported in [8] may 
   be a candidate for this approach. 
    
   For MPEG-4 applications, the multiplexing technique needs to address 
   the following requirements: 
    
   i. The ESs multiplexed in one stream can change frequently during a 
   session. Consequently, the coding type, individual packet size and 
   temporal relationships between the multiplexed data units must be 
   handled dynamically. 
    
   ii. The multiplexing scheme should have a mechanism to determine the 
   ES identifier (ES_ID) for each of the multiplexed packets. ES_ID is 
   not a part of the SL header. 
    
   iii. In general, an SL packet does not contain information about its 
   size. The multiplexing scheme should be able to delineate the 
   multiplexed packets whose lengths may vary from a few bytes to close 
   to the path-MTU. 
    
4.5 Overlap with RFC 3016 
    
   This payload format has been designed to have an overlap with RFC 
   3016 [7]. The conditions for this overlap are: 
   Conditions for RFC 3016: 
   i. MPEG-4 video elementary streams only 
   ii. Maximum one VOP or Video Packet per RTP packet 
   Conditions for this payload format: 
   i. No structural parameters defined (or all set to zero), i.e. 
   Single-SL mode with empty MSLH and empty RSLH.  
   ii. Receivers MUST be ready to accept (ignore) video configuration 
   headers (e.g. VOSH, VO and VOL) and visual-object-sequence-end-code 
   transported in-band. 
    
5. Types and Names 
    
   This section describes the MIME types and names associated with this 
   payload format. Section 5.1 is intended for registration with IANA 
   in RFC 2048. 
    
   This format may require additional information about the mapping to 
   be made available to the receiver. This is done using parameters 
   described in the next section. The absence of any of these fields is 
   equivalent to a field set to the default value, which is always

                RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams      April 2001 
 
 
   zero. The absence of any such parameters resolves into a default 
   "basic" configuration. 
    
   In the MPEG-4 framework the SL stream configuration information is 
   carried using the Object Descriptor. For compatibility with 
   receivers that do not implement the full MPEG-4 system specification 
   this information MAY also be signaled using parameters described 
   here. When such information is present both in an Object Descriptor 
   and as a parameter of this payload format it MUST be exactly the 
   same. 
    
   For transport of MPEG-4 audio and video without the use of MPEG-4 
   systems, as well as to support non-MPEG-4 system receivers, it is 
   also possible to transport information on the profile and level of 
   the stream and on the decoder configuration. This is also described 
   in the next section. 
    
5.1 MIME type registration 
 
   MIME media type name:  "video" or ôaudio" or "application" 
    
   "video" SHOULD be used for MPEG-4 Video streams (ISO/IEC 14496-2) or 
   MPEG-4 Systems streams that convey information needed for an 
   audio/visual presentation. 
    
   "audio" SHOULD be used for MPEG-4 Audio streams (ISO/IEC 14496-3) or 
   MPEG-4 Systems streams that convey information needed for an audio 
   only presentation. 
    
   "application" SHOULD be used for MPEG-4 Systems streams 
   (ISO/IEC14496-1) that serve other purposes than audio/visual 
   presentation, e.g. in some cases when MPEG-J streams are 
   transmitted. 
    
   MIME subtype name: mpeg4-sl 
    
   Required parameters: none 
    
   Optional parameters: 
    
   DTSDeltaLength: 
   The number of bits on which the DTSDelta field is encoded in MSLH. 
   The default value is zero and indicates the absence of DTSFlag and 
   DTSDelta in MSLH (the stream does not transport decodingTimeStamps). 
   A value larger than zero indicates that there is a DTSFlag in each 
   MSLH. Since decodingTimeStamp -if present- must be encoded as a 
   difference to the RTP time stamp, the DTSDeltaLength parameter MUST 
   be present in order to transport decodingTimeStamps with this 
   payload format. 
         
   CTSDeltaLength: 
   The number of bits on which the CTSDelta field is encoded in (non-
   first) MSLH. The default value is zero and indicates the absence of

                RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams      April 2001 
 
 
   the CTSFlag and CTSDelta fields in MSLH. Non-zero values MOST NOT be 
   signaled in the Single-SL mode. Since compositionTimeStamps -if 
   present- must be encoded as a difference to the RTP time stamp, the 
   CTSDeltaLength parameter MUST be present in order to transport 
   compositionTimeStamps using this payload format (in the Multiple-SL 
   mode). However CTSDeltaLength SHOULD be set to zero (or not 
   signaled) for streams that have a constant Access Unit duration 
   (which can be explicitly signaled using the DurationFlag and 
   AccessUnitDuration field of SLConfigDescriptor). 
         
   OCRDeltaLength: 
   The number of bits on which the OCRDelta field is encoded in RSLH. 
   The default value is zero and indicates the absence of OCR for this 
   stream. Since objectClockReference -if present- must be encoded as a 
   difference to the RTP time stamp, the OCRDeltaLength parameter MUST 
   be present in order to transport objectClockReferences with this 
   payload format. 
    
   SLPPSizeLength: 
   The number of bits on which the SLPPayloadSize field of MSLH is 
   encoded. The default value is zero and indicates the Single-SL mode 
   (unless SLPPSize is present). Simultaneous presence of this 
   parameter and SLPPSize is illegal. Either the SLPPSizeLength or 
   SLPPSize parameter MUST be present in order to signal the Multiple-
   SL mode of this payload format. 
    
   SLPPSize: 
   The constant size in bytes of each SL Packet Payload for this 
   stream. The default value is zero and indicates variable SL Packet 
   Payload size (or the Single-SL mode if SLPPSizeLength is absent). 
   Simultaneous presence of this parameter and SLPPSizeLength is 
   illegal. Either the SLPPSizeLength or SLPPSize parameter MUST be 
   present in order to signal the Multiple-SL mode of this payload 
   format. When SLPPSize is present the SLPPayloadSize of MSLH in the 
   RTP packets MUST NOT be present. 
    
   SLPSeqNumLength: 
   The number of bits on which the SLPSeqNum is encoded in the first 
   MSLH. The default value is zero and indicates the absence of 
   SLPSeqNum and SLPSeqNumDelta for all MSLHs. Since 
   packetSequenceNumber -if present- must be mapped in MSLH, the 
   SLPSeqNumLength parameter MUST be present in order to transport 
   packetSequenceNumber with this payload format. 
 
   SLPSeqNumDeltaLength: 
   The number of bits on which the SLPSeqNumDelta are encoded in any 
   non-first MSLH. The default value is zero and indicates that 
   packetSequenceNumber MUST be incremented by one for each SL packet 
   in the RTP packet (see section 3.5). Since when interleaving 
   packetSequenceNumber does not increment by 1 inside a RTP packet, 
   the SLPSeqNumDeltaLength parameter MUST be present when using 
   interleaving with this payload format.

   RSLHSectionSizeLength: 
   The number of bits that is used to encode the RSLHSectionSize field. 
   The default value is zero and indicates the absence of the whole 
   RSLHSection for all RTP packets of this stream. Compatibility with 
   RFC 3016 requires that the RSLHSection must be empty, including the 
   RSLHSectionSize field. This is the reason why there is such a 
   variable length with a default value indicating absence of the 
   RSLHSectionSize field. 
    
   SLConfigDescriptor: 
   A base-64 encoding of the SLConfigDescriptor. This SHALL be the 
   original SLConfigDescriptor and it SHALL be the same as the one 
   transported by the OD framework, if any. 
    
   profile-level-id: 
   A decimal representation of the MPEG-4 Profile Level indication 
   value. For audio this parameter indicates which MPEG-4 Audio tool 
   subsets are applied to encode the audio stream and is defined in 
   defined in ISO/IEC 14496-1. For video this parameter indicates which 
   MPEG-4 Visual tool subsets are applied to encode the video stream 
   and is defined in Table G-1 of ISO/IEC 14496-2. This parameter MAY 
   be used in the capability exchange or session setup procedure to 
   indicate MPEG-4 Profile and Level combination of which the relevant 
   MPEG-4 media codec is capable. If this parameter is not specified by 
   the procedure, its default value of 1 (Simple Profile/Level 1) is 
   used. 
    
   Config: 
   A hexadecimal representation of an octet string that expresses the 
   media payload configuration. Configuration data is mapped onto the 
   octet string in an MSB-first basis. The first bit of the 
   configuration data SHALL be located at the MSB of the first octet. 
   In the last octet, zero-valued padding bits, if necessary, shall 
   follow the configuration data. For audio this is a 
   "StreamMuxConfig", as defined in ISO/IEC 14496-3. For video this 
   expresses the MPEG-4 Visual configuration information, as defined in 
   subclause 6.2.1 Start codes of ISO/IEC14496-2[2][4][9] and the 
   configuration information indicated by this parameter SHALL be the 
   same as the configuration information in the corresponding MPEG-4 
   Visual stream, except for first-half-vbv-occupancy and latter-half-
   vbv-occupancy, if it exists, which may vary in the repeated 
   configuration information inside an MPEG-4 Visual stream (See 6.2.1 
   Start codes of ISO/IEC14496-2). 
    
   object-type: 
   A decimal representation of the MPEG-4 Audio Object Type value 
   defined in ISO/IEC 14496-3. This parameter specifies the tool used 
   by the encoder. It CAN be used to limit the capability within the 
   specified "profile-level-id". 
    
   Bitrate: 
   A decimal representation of the audio bitrate in bits per second for 
   the audio bit stream.

   Encoding considerations: 
   System bitstreams MUST be generated according to MPEG-4 System 
   specifications (ISO/IEC 14496-1). Video bitstreams MUST be generated 
   according to MPEG-4 Visual specifications (ISO/IEC 14496-2). Audio 
   bitstreams MUST be generated according to MPEG-4 Visual 
   specifications (ISO/IEC 14496-3). All SL streams MUST be generated 
   according to MPEG-4 Sync Layer specifications (ISO/IEC 14496-1 
   section 10), in order to read this format the SLConfigDescriptor is 
   REQUIRED. These bitstream are binary data and MUST be encoded for 
   non-binary transport (for Email, the Base64 encoding is sufficient).  
   This type is also defined for transfer via RTP.  The RTP packets 
   MUST be packetized according to the RTP payload format defined in 
   RFC <self-reference-to-this>. 
    
   Security considerations: 
   As in RFC <self-reference-to-this>. 
    
   Interoperability considerations: 
   MPEG-4 provides a large and rich set of tools for the coding of 
   visual objects.  For effective implementation of the standard, 
   subsets of the MPEG-4 tool sets have been provided for use in 
   specific applications. These subsets, called 'Profiles', limit the 
   size of the tool set a decoder is required to implement. In order to 
   restrict computational complexity, one or more 'Levels' are set for 
   each Profile.  A Profile@Level combination allows: 
   o a codec builder to implement only the subset of the standard he 
   needs, while maintaining interworking with other MPEG-4 devices 
   included in the same combination, and 
   o checking whether MPEG-4 devices comply with the standard 
   ('conformance testing'). 
   A stream SHALL be compliant with the MPEG-4 Profile@Level specified 
   by the parameter "profile-level-id". Interoperability between a 
   sender and a receiver may be achieved by specifying the parameter 
   "profile-level-id" in MIME content, or by arranging in the 
   capability exchange/announcement procedure to set this parameter 
   mutually to the same value. 
    
   Published specification: 
   The specifications for MPEG-4 streams are presented in ISO/IEC 
   14469-1, 14469-2, and 14469-3.  The RTP payload format is described 
   in RFC <self-reference-to-this>.

5.2 Concatenation of parameters 
    
   Multiple parameters SHOULD be expressed as a MIME media type string, 
   in the form of a semicolon-separated list of parameter=value pairs 
   (see examples in Appendix). 
    
5.3 Usage of SDP 
    
5.3.1 The a=fmtp keyword 
    
   It is assumed that one typical way to transport the above-described 
   parameters associated with this payload format is via a SDP message 
   for example transported to the client in reply to a RTSP DESCRIBE of 
   via SAP. In that case the (a=fmtp) keyword MUST be used as described 
   in RFC 2327 [10, section 6]. The syntax being then: 
    
   a=fmtp:<format> <parameter name>=<value> 
    
5.3.2 SDP example 
    
   The following is an example of SDP syntax for the description of a 
   session containing one MPEG-4 audio stream, one MPEG-4 video and two 
   MPEG-4 system stream, transported using this format and the AVP 
   profile [12]. Note that the video stream DTSDelta are encoded on 4 
   bits in this example. See the Appendix for more examples. 
    
   o= .... 
   I= .... 
   c=IN IP4 123.234.71.112 
   m=video 1034 RTP/AVP 97 
   a=fmtp:DTSDeltaLength=4 
   a=rtpmap:97 mpeg4-sl 
   m=audio 810  RTP/AVP 98 
   a=fmtp: profile-level-id=1; config=7866E7E6EF 
   a=rtpmpa:98 mpeg4-sl 
   m=application 1234  RTP/AVP 99 
   a=rtpmap:99 mpeg4-sl 
   m=application 1234  RTP/AVP 99 
   a=rtpmap:99 mpeg4-sl 
 
6. Security Considerations

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification 
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP 
   specification [5]. This implies that confidentiality of the media 
   streams is achieved by encryption. Because the data compression used 
   with this payload format is applied end-to-end, encryption may be 
   performed on the compressed data so there is no conflict between the 
   two operations. The packet processing complexity of this payload 
   type ûi.e. excluding media data processing- does not exhibit any 
   significant non-uniformity in the receiver side to cause a denial-
   of-service threat. 
    
   However, it is possible to inject non-compliant MPEG streams (Audio, 
   Video, and Systems) to overload the receiver/decoder's buffers which 
   might compromise the functionality of the receiver or even crash it. 
   This is especially true for end-to-end systems like MPEG where the 
   buffer models are precisely defined. 
    
   MPEG-4 Systems supports stream types including commands that are 
   executed on the terminal like OD commands, BIFS commands, etc. and 
   programmatic content like MPEG-J (Java(TM) Byte Code) and 
   ECMASCRIPT. It is possible to use one or more of the above in a 
   manner non-compliant to MPEG to crash or temporarily make the 
   receiver unavailable. 
    
   Authentication mechanisms can be used to validate of the sender and 
   the data to prevent security problems due to non-compliant malignant 
   MPEG-4 streams. 
    
   A security model is defined in MPEG-4 Systems streams carrying MPEG-
   J access units which comprises Java(TM) classes and objects. MPEG-J 
   defines a set of Java APIs and a secure execution model.  MPEG-J 
   content can call this set of APIs and Java(TM) methods from a set of 
   Java packages supported in the receiver within the defined security 
   model. According to this security model, downloaded byte code is 
   forbidden to load libraries, define native methods, start programs, 
   read or write files, or read system properties. 
    
   Receivers can implement intelligent filters to validate the buffer 
   requirements or parametric (OD, BIFS, etc.) or programmatic (MPEG-J, 
   ECMAScript) commands in the streams. However, this can increase the 
   complexity significantly.

APPENDIX: Examples of usage of this payload format 
    
   This payload format has been designed to transport with flexibility 
   a very versatile packetization scheme (the MPEG-4 Synchronization 
   Layer); its complexity is therefore larger than the average for RTP 
   payload formats. For this reason this section describes a number of 
   key examples of how this payload format can be used.  
    
   A C++-like syntax called SDL (Syntactic Description Language) 
   defined in [1, section 14] is used to economically describe MPEG-4 
   system data structures. 
 
Appendix.1 MPEG-4 Video 
    
   Let us consider the case of a 30 frames per second MPEG-4 video 
   stream which bit rate is high enough that Access Units have to be 
   split in several SL packets (typically above 300 kb/s). 
    
   Let us assume also that the video codec generates in that case Video 
   Packets suitable to fit in one SL packet i.e that the video codec is 
   MTU aware and the MTU is 1500 bytes. We assume furthermore that this 
   stream contains B frames and that decodingTimeStamps are present. 
    
SLConfigDescriptor 
    
   In this example the SLConfigDescriptor is: 
    
   class SLConfigDescriptor extends BaseDescriptor : bit(8) 
   tag=SLConfigDescrTag { 
    bit(8) predefined; 
    if (predefined==0) { 
     bit(1) useAccessUnitStartFlag; = 1 
     bit(1) useAccessUnitEndFlag; = 0 
     bit(1) useRandomAccessPointFlag; = 1 
     bit(1) hasRandomAccessUnitsOnlyFlag; = 0 
     bit(1) usePaddingFlag; = 0 
     bit(1) useTimeStampsFlag; = 1 
     bit(1) useIdleFlag; = 0 
     bit(1) durationFlag; = 0 
     bit(32) timeStampResolution; = 30 
     bit(32) OCRResolution; = 0 
     bit(8) timeStampLength; = 32 
     bit(8) OCRLength; = 0 
     bit(8) AU_Length; = 0 
     bit(8) instantBitrateLength; = 0

                RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams      April 2001 
 
 
     bit(4) degradationPriorityLength; = 0 
     bit(5) AU_seqNumLength; = 0 
     bit(5) packetSeqNumLength; = 0 
     bit(2) reserved=0b11; 
    } 
    if (durationFlag) { 
     bit(32) timeScale; // NOT USED 
     bit(16) accessUnitDuration;  // NOT USED 
     bit(16) compositionUnitDuration;  // NOT USED 
    } 
    if (!useTimeStampsFlag) { 
     bit(timeStampLength) startDecodingTimeStamp; = 0 
     bit(timeStampLength) startCompositionTimeStamp; = 0 
    } 
   } 
    
   The useRandomAccessPointFlag is set so that the 
   randomAccessPointFlag can indicate that the corresponding SL packet 
   contains a GOV and the first Video Packet of an Intra coded frame. 
    
SL Packet Header structure 
    
   With this configuration we have the following SL packet header 
   structure: 
    
   aligned(8) class SL_PacketHeader (SLConfigDescriptor SL) { 
    if (SL.useAccessUnitStartFlag) { 
     bit(1) accessUnitStartFlag; // 1 bit 
    } 
    if (accessUnitStartFlag) { 
     if (SL.useRandomAccessPointFlag) { 
      bit(1) randomAccessPointFlag; // 1 bit 
     } 
     if (SL.useTimeStampsFlag) { 
      bit(1) decodingTimeStampFlag; // 1 bit 
      bit(1) compositionTimeStampFlag; // 1 bit 
     } 
     if (decodingTimeStampFlag) { 
      bit(SL.timeStampLength) decodingTimeStamp; 
     } 
     if (compositionTimeStampFlag) { 
      bit(SL.timeStampLength) compositionTimeStamp; 
     } 
    } 
   } 
    
Parameters 
    
   decodingTimeStamps are encoded on 32 bits, which is much more than 
   needed for delta. Therefore the sender will use DTSDeltaLength to 
   signal that only 6 bits are used for the coding of relative DTS in 
   the RTP packet.

   The RSLHSectionSize cannot exceed 2 bits, which is encoded on 2 bits 
   and signaled by RSLHSectionSizeLength. The resulting concatenated 
   fmtp line is: 
    
   a=fmtp:<format> DTSDeltaLength=6;RSLHSectionSizeLength=2 
    
RTP packet structure 
    
   Two cases can occur; for packets that transport first fragments of 
   Access Units we have:

   Note the compositionTimeStamp is never present since it would be 
   redundant with the RTP time stamp. However the value of CTSFlag is 1 
   to indicate to the receiver that the value of 
   compositionTimeStampFlag for the corresponding reconstructed SL 
   packed. 
    
Overhead estimation 
    
   In this example we have a RTP overhead of 40 + 2 bytes for 1400 
   bytes of payload i.e. 3 % overhead. 
 
Appendix.2 RFC 3016 compatible MPEG-4 Video 
    
   This is an example of a video stream where the SL is configured to 
   produce RTP packets compatible with RFC 3016. 
    
SLConfigDescriptor 
    
   In this example the SLConfigDescriptor is: 
    
   class SLConfigDescriptor extends BaseDescriptor : bit(8) 
   tag=SLConfigDescrTag { 
    bit(8) predefined; 
    if (predefined==0) { 
     bit(1) useAccessUnitStartFlag; = 0 
     bit(1) useAccessUnitEndFlag; = 1 
     bit(1) useRandomAccessPointFlag; = 0 
     bit(1) hasRandomAccessUnitsOnlyFlag; = 0 
     bit(1) usePaddingFlag; = 0 
     bit(1) useTimeStampsFlag; = 0 
     bit(1) useIdleFlag; = 0 
     bit(1) durationFlag; = 0 
     bit(32) timeStampResolution; = 0 
     bit(32) OCRResolution; = 0 
     bit(8) timeStampLength; = 0 
     bit(8) OCRLength; = 0 
     bit(8) AU_Length; = 0 
     bit(8) instantBitrateLength; = 0 
     bit(4) degradationPriorityLength; = 0 
     bit(5) AU_seqNumLength; = 0 
     bit(5) packetSeqNumLength; = 0 
     bit(2) reserved=0b11; 
    } 
    if (durationFlag) {

     bit(32) timeScale; // NOT USED 
     bit(16) accessUnitDuration;  // NOT USED 
     bit(16) compositionUnitDuration;  // NOT USED 
    } 
    if (!useTimeStampsFlag) { 
     bit(timeStampLength) startDecodingTimeStamp; = 0 
     bit(timeStampLength) startCompositionTimeStamp; = 0 
    } 
   } 
 
SL Packet Header structure 
    
   With this configuration we have the following SL packet header 
   structure: 
    
   aligned(8) class SL_PacketHeader (SLConfigDescriptor SL) { 
    if (SL.useAccessUnitEndFlag) { 
     bit(1) accessUnitEndFlag; // 1 bit 
    } 
   } 
    
Parameters 
    
   This configuration is the default one; no parameters are required. 
    
RTP packet structure 
    
   Note that accessUnitEndFlag is mapped to the RTP header M bit. 
    
   +=========================================+=============+ 
   | Field                                   |  size       |

   | SL packet payload                       | 1400 bytes  | 
   +-----------------------------------------+-------------+ 
 
Overhead 
 
   In this example we have a RTP overhead of 40 bytes for 1400 bytes of 
   payload i.e. 3 % overhead. 
 
Appendix.3 Low delay MPEG-4 Audio 
    
   This example is for a low delay audio service. For this reason a 
   single SL packet is transported in each RTP packet. 
    
SLConfigDescriptor 
    
   Since CTS=DTS and AccessUnit duration is constant signaling of MPEG-
   4 time stamps is not needed (the durationFlag is set)

                RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams      April 2001 
 
 
   We also assume here an audio Object Type for which all Access Units 
   are Random Access Points, which is signaled using the 
   hasRandomAccessUnitsOnlyFlag in the SLConfigDescriptor. 
    
   We assume furtheremore a mode where the Access Unit size is constant 
   and 5 bytes (which is signaled with AU_Length). 
    
   In this example the SLConfigDescriptor is: 
    
   class SLConfigDescriptor extends BaseDescriptor : bit(8) 
   tag=SLConfigDescrTag { 
    bit(8) predefined; 
    if (predefined==0) { 
     bit(1) useAccessUnitStartFlag; = 0 
     bit(1) useAccessUnitEndFlag; = 0

Overhead estimation 
    
   The overhead is extremely large i.e. more than 800 %, since 40 bytes 
   of headers are required to transport 5 bytes of data. Note however 
   that RTP header compression would work well since time stamps 
   increments are constant. 
    
    
    
    
Appendix.4 Media delivery MPEG-4 Audio 
    
   This example is for a media delivery service where delay is not an 
   issue but efficiency is. In this case several SL Packets are 
   transported in each RTP packet. 
    
SLConfigDescriptor 
    
   Is the same as in Appendix.3 
    
SL packet header 
    
   With this configuration the SL packet header is empty. 
    
Parameters 
    
   The absence of RSLHSectionSizeLength indicates that the RSLHSection 
   is empty. 
    
   The size of SL Packets (which are all complete Access Units in this 
   case) is constant and is indicated  with: 
    
   a=fmtp:<format> SLPPSize=5 
    
   This also indicates to the receiver that the Multiple-SL mode will 
   be used, i.e. that a 2 bytes field will give the size of the 
   MSLHSection. In this case however this field always contains zero 
   since the MSLHSection is empty.

Overhead estimation 
    
   The overhead is 3% i.e. minimal. 
 
Appendix.5 A more complex case: AAC with interleaving 
    
   Let us consider AAC around 130 kb/s where each Access Unit is split 
   in 4 SL packets corresponding to Error Sensitivity Categories (ESC) 
   of maximum 90 bytes for which interleaving is very useful in terms 
   of error resilience. We will therefore use an interleaving scheme 
   where 15 SL Packets from 15 consecutive Access Units will be 
   interleaved per RTP packet to match a MTU of 1500 bytes. 
    
   The interleaving sequence is 4 RTP packets and 350 ms long, which is 
   too long for conferencing but perfectly OK for Internet radio. 
    
   Since the sequence contains 60 SL packets, the sequence number can 
   be encoded on 6 bits. But 2 bits are actually enough if the sender 
   always resets the SL packet sequence number to zero at the start of 
   each sequence, since only the first MSLH in each of the 4 RTP 
   packets in the sequence carries an absolute sequence number value 
   (0,1,2,3). 
    
   2 bits are also enough for SLPSeqNumDelta, which is constant and 
   equal to 3 (since +1 is automatically added)  
    
   Note that the 4th RTP packet in each sequence has its M bit set to 1 
   since it contains 15 SL packets transporting the end of 15 different 
   Access Units. 
    
   With this scheme a sender (for example upon reception of RTCP 
   reports indicating high loss rates) can ûfor example- choose to 
   duplicate for each interleaving sequence the first RTP packet that 
   contains the most useful data in terms of ESC or apply other error 
   protection techniques, with due care to congestion issues.

   In this example we will also show several other SL features (OCR, AU 
   boundary flags, as detailed below). 
    
   One feature demonstrated by this example is the degradation 
   priority. We assume degradation priority can take 4 different 
   values, one for each SL packet of an Access Unit and is encoded on 2 
   bits. This interleaving scheme makes sure that only SL packets of 
   identical degradation priorities are grouped in the same RTP packet 
   (3.6.3) and that only the first RSLH of each RTP packet transports 
   the degradation priority. 
    
   We also assume that for each last SL packet of each RTP packet the 
   server inserts an OCR. 
    
    
SLConfigDescriptor  
    
   In this example the SLConfigDescriptor is: 
    
   class SLConfigDescriptor extends BaseDescriptor : bit(8) 
   tag=SLConfigDescrTag { 
    bit(8) predefined; 
    if (predefined==0) { 
     bit(1) useAccessUnitStartFlag; = 1 
     bit(1) useAccessUnitEndFlag; = 1 
     bit(1) useRandomAccessPointFlag; = 0 
     bit(1) hasRandomAccessUnitsOnlyFlag; = 1 
     bit(1) usePaddingFlag; = 0 
     bit(1) useTimeStampsFlag; = 0 
     bit(1) useIdleFlag; = 0 
     bit(1) durationFlag; = 1 
     bit(32) timeStampResolution; = 0 
     bit(32) OCRResolution; = 30 
     bit(8) timeStampLength; = 0 
     bit(8) OCRLength; = 32 
     bit(8) AU_Length; = 0 
     bit(8) instantBitrateLength; = 0 
     bit(4) degradationPriorityLength; = 2 
     bit(5) AU_seqNumLength; = 0 
     bit(5) packetSeqNumLength; = 6 
     bit(2) reserved=0b11; 
    } 
    if (durationFlag) { 
     bit(32) timeScale; = 1000// milliseconds 
     bit(16) accessUnitDuration; = 23.22 // ms 
     bit(16) compositionUnitDuration; = 23.22 // ms 
    } 
    if (!useTimeStampsFlag) { 
     bit(timeStampLength) startDecodingTimeStamp; = 0 
     bit(timeStampLength) startCompositionTimeStamp; = 0 
    } 
   }

SL Packet Header structure 
    
   With this configuration we have the following SL packet header 
   structure: 
    
   aligned(8) class SL_PacketHeader (SLConfigDescriptor SL) { 
    bit(1) accessUnitStartFlag;  
    bit(1) accessUnitEndFlag; 
    bit(1) OCRflag; 
    bit(SL.packetSeqNumLength) packetSequenceNumber; 
    bit(1) DegPrioflag; 
    if (DegPrioflag) { 
     bit(SL.degradationPriorityLength) degradationPriority;} 
    if (OCRflag) { 
     bit(SL.OCRLength) objectClockReference;} 
    } 
   } 
    
Parameters 
    
   The RSLHSectionSize cannot exceed 2 bits, which is encoded on 2 bits 
   and signaled by RSLHSectionSizeLength. 
    
   The resulting concatenated fmtp line is: 
    
   a=fmtp:<format> 
   SLPPSizeLength=6;RSLHSectionSizeLength=2;SLPSeqNumLength=2;SLPSeqNum
   DeltaLength=2;OCRDeltaLength=16

   The MSLHSection is 19 bytes, the RSLHSection is 10 bytes; in this 
   example we have therefore a RTP overhead of 40 + 23 bytes for 1350 
   bytes (max) of payload i.e. around 5 % overhead.
