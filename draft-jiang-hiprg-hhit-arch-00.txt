1. Introduction 

   This document analyzes the problems and limitation of the current 
   flat-structured Host Identity Tag (HIT, [RFC4423]) architecture. The 
   document specifies a hierarchical HIT architecture, which splits a 
   HIT into two parts: a HIP management domain tag and a host tag. The 
   proposed hierarchical HIT architecture is also compatible with the 
   flat-structured HIT architecture. The format of HIT and the detail 
   process of HITs generation are defined. This architecture and the 
   process of HITs generation ensure the global uniqueness of HITs. This 
   architecture also enables the multiple HIP management domains, solves 
   the deployment problem of current flat-structured HIT architecture. 
   It also enhances the scalability and resolution efficiency of the 
   mapping system. 

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1]. 

3. Analysis of the Current Flat-structured HIT Architecture 

   The original HIT concept was defined in [RFC4423]. ''A Host Identity 
   Tag (HIT) is used in other protocols to represent the Host Identity.'' 
   It is a quite restricted definition. However, [HIP-base] has updated 
   the HIT concept and enhanced the functionality of HIT. ''... the Host

   Identity Tag (HIT), becomes the operational representation. It is 128 
   bits long and is used in the HIP payloads and to index the 
   corresponding state in the end hosts.'' 

   In order to be able to represent hosts, the uniqueness of HITs is 
   required in global scope. ''In the HIP packets, the HITs identify the 
   sender and recipient of a packet. Consequently, a HIT should be 
   unique in the whole IP universe as long as it is being used.'' 
   [RFC4423] 

   Although mathematically ''the probability of HIT collision between two 
   hosts is very low'' [HIP-base], there is no mechanism to ensure that a 
   HIT is global unique. The current defined HIT is generated according 
   to the ORCHID generation method described in [RFC4843]. [RFC4843] 
   suggests "several possible methods ... to preserve a low enough 
   probability of collisions''. However, it cannot guarantee the global 
   uniqueness of HITs. Furthermore, while the number of end devices 
   continuously grows in the future, the possibility of HIT collision 
   will increase rapidly. A technical mechanism is needed to ensure the 
   global uniqueness of HITs, particularly with the consideration that 
   collisions may happen. 

   [RFC 4423] states ''In the extremely rare case of a single HIT mapping 
   to more than one Host Identity, the Host Identifiers (public keys) 
   will make the final difference.'' It means the mapping system between 
   HIP and IP must store or at least be aware of the Host Identifiers of 
   all hosts. Given the facts that the Host Identifiers is quite large 
   and may be in various formats, the storage and management burden of 
   the mapping system could be quite high. If there was a mechanism to 
   ensure the global uniqueness of HITs, then, the mapping system would 
   not have to be aware the Host Identifiers. 

   Furthermore, within the flat-structured HIT architecture, the 
   robustness of resolution efficiency in the supporting mapping system 
   is in a big question mark: a mapping server has to hold or at least 
   to be able to access a large database that contains all HITs 
   information in the global scope. The number of HITs is at least in 
   billion-level giving the fact there are billions hosts now. In the 
   future, it may rapidly grow up to trillion-level, or even higher. The 
   storage burden, maintenance consumption and synchronization updating 
   are problems that are very difficult to solve. For each single 
   looking up operation, one may search through most of the database, on 
   average, O(number of total global HITs). It is unfeasible for both 
   computing power and time reasons. 

   One more disadvantage that the flat-structured HIT architecture is 
   the difficulties for management. There is no common between HITs that

   their HIs assigned by the same authority or that their represented 
   hosts have the same properties. Hence, it is difficult to categorize 
   HITS. The ACL operators have to have explicit list of HITs in the ACL. 
   Contrarily, the hierarchical HITs are aggregatable. It makes HITs 
   manageable. Each network manager just needs to manage and maintain 
   HITs and their mapping information in a relatively small range. 

   According to the above analysis, it is nature to break up the flat 
   HIT architecture into hierarchy. It can effectively break up global 
   uniqueness into smaller scope uniqueness. It can improve the 
   resolution processing and enhance the scalability and resolution 
   efficiency. Furthermore, it can optimize the management of both the 
   host identity and the mapping database. Each management domain is 
   responsible only for a part of the global HIT architecture. However, 
   it is useful that the new hierarchical HIT architecture keep 
   compatible with the flat HIT architecture for privacy purpose and 
   other usage scenarios. 

4. Hierarchical HIT Architecture 

   In this document, we introduce a two-level hierarchically structured 
   HIT architecture. HIT is ''128 bits long value and is used in the HIP 
   payloads and to index the corresponding state in the end hosts.'' 
   [HIP-base] ''In the HIP packets, the HITs identify the sender and 
   recipient of a packet.'' [RFC 4423] HITs refer to nodes or virtual 
   nodes. All nodes are required to have at least one HIT. A single node 
   may also have multiple HITs. Applications on a same node may bind to 
   different HITs. This is sometimes convenient for point-to-point 
   communications. 

   We break the current 128-bit flat-structured HIT into two parts: 32-
   bit HIP management domain tag and 96-bit host tag. It can represent 
   maximum 2^32 management domains and 2^96 hosts within each management 
   domain. 

   |          32 bits              |              96 bits            | 
   +-------------------------------+---------------------------------+ 
   |  HIP management domain tag    |             host tag            | 
   +-------------------------------+---------------------------------+ 

   For the secure consideration, we assign more bits to the host tag, 
   which is hash output, leaving less but enough bits for HIP management 
   domain tag. The more the number of bits the host tag is, the more 
   secure it is against brute-force attacks. In the worst case, if the 
   hash algorithm cannot be inverted, the expected number of iterations 
   required for a brute force attack is O(2^96) in order to find a host 
   identity that matches with a given host tag.

   The HIP management domain, as its literal, is a logic region in which 
   the HIs of all nodes are assigned by the same authority. Within a 
   same HIP management domain, all the nodes should have the same HIP 
   management domain tag or the same leftmost certain bits. Furthermore, 
   the authority may be organized internally hierarchically. 

   The HIP management domain tag should be assigned by a global 
   management organization with the principle that every HIP management 
   domain tag must be globally unique. 

   Consequentially, the HIP management domain tags may be organized 
   hierarchically. For example, a big organization may obtain a block of 
   HIP management tags with a given leftmost 24-bit. It then can assign 
   32-bit HIP management domain tags to its sub-organizations. All these 
   sub-organizations have the same leftmost 24-bit. 

   The host tags remain the original meaning of HIT -                                                       - ''a hashed encoding 
   of the Host Identity''. For each HIP management domain, it is 
   mandatory to maintain the uniqueness of all host tags. It is 
   guarantee by the process of generating a HIT, see Section 5. 

   For index and resolution purposes, HITs are aggregatable with 
   management domain tags of arbitrary bit-length, similar to IPv4 
   addresses under Classless Inter-Domain Routing [RFC4632]. 

4.1. Compatible flat-structured HITs 

   Obviously, not all hosts are willing to use hierarchical HITs in all 
   scenarios for various reasons, such as privacy, etc. Therefore, it is 
   useful that the hierarchical HIT architecture keep compatible with 
   the flat HIT architecture. 

   The flat HITs can be defined as a specific sub-set of the 
   hierarchical HITs architecture. With a the same reserved Flat HIT Tag 
   (2 or 3 bits) at the beginning and the number of bits that can be 
   chosen arbitrarily reduce 2 or 3 bits out of 128, flat HITs can be 
   used as defined in [RFC 4423]. 

   |                           128 bits                              | 
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------+ 
   |FHIT Tag|            Flat host identity tag                      | 
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------+ 

4.2. HITs on HIP-enabled nodes 

   HIP-enabled nodes may have considerable or little knowledge of the 
   internal structure of the hierarchical HIT, depending on the role the

   node plays (for instance, host versus mapping server). At a minimum, 
   a node may consider pre-generated HITs have no internal structure: 

   |                           128 bits                              | 
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------+ 
   |                       host identity tag                         | 
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------+ 

   Only sophisticated hosts may additionally be aware of the type of 
   their HITS and use the hierarchical structure of HITs to simplify the 
   resolution procedure. 

5. Generating a hierarchical HIT 

   The process of generating a new hierarchical HIT takes three input 
   values: a 32-bit HIP management domain tag, a 2-bit collusion count, 
   the host identity (the public key of an asymmetric key pair). A 
   hierarchical HIT should be generated as follows: 

      1. Set the 2-bit collision count to zero. 

      2. Concatenate from left to right the HIP management domain tag, 
         the collusion count, and the host identity. Execute the SHA-1 
         algorithm on the concatenation. Take the 94 leftmost bits of 
         the SHA-1 hash value. 

      3. Concatenate from left to right the 32-bit HIP management 
         domain tag, the 2-bit collusion count and 94-bit hash output 
         to form a 128-bit HIT. 

      4. Perform duplicate detection within the HIP management domain 
         scope. If a HIT collision is detected, increment the collision 
         count by one and go back to step 2. However, after four 
         collisions, stop and report the error. 

   The design that includes the HIP management domain tag in the hash 
   input is mainly against the re-computation attack: create a database 
   of HITs and matching public keys. With the design, an attacker must 
   create a separate database for each HIP management domain. 

   The design reduces the number of bit of hash output from 96 to 94. It 
   does reduce the safety. However, O(2^94) iterations is large enough 
   to prevent brute-force attacks. 

   For security reason, the abovementioned SHA-1 hash algorithm may be 
   replaced any safer algorithm.

6. Security Considerations 

   The most important security property of HIT is that it is self-
   certifying (i.e., given a HIT, it is computationally hard to find a 
   Host Identity key that matches the HIT). Although this document 
   limits the hash output to be 94-bit long, it does not affect the self 
   certifying security property. 

7. IANA Considerations 

   This document defines a new namespace: HIP management domain tag. It 
   is a 32-bit long value, which represents a globally unique HIP 
   management domain. IANA may found an authority institute to manage 
   the global assignment of HIP management domain tag.
