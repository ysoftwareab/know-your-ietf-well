Internet-Draft Address Autoconfiguration for multiple MBRs  July 7, 2008


Abstract 

   In order to allow the subordinate MANET to be connected to the 
   external network, the MANET border router (MBR) has been defined. For 
   providing scalability and reliability to the subordinate MANET, 
   multiple MBRs may be deployed. One of the issues on the subordinate 
   MANET with multiple MBRs is which network prefixes are to be 
   advertised by MBRs. In the case when MBRs advertise different network 
   prefixes, if a MANET node changes its default MBR to a new one, the 
   node may have to transmit packets via non-optimal paths to keep using 
   the existing connection to the previous MBR, or change its address by 
   using the network prefix information from the new MBR. In the latter 
   case, on-going sessions can be terminated because of the address 
   change. In this draft, we define a PMIPv6 based address 
   autoconfiguration mechanism that enables MANET nodes to operate 
   properly when all MBRs advertise the same network prefix in the 
   subordinate MANET.

Internet-Draft Address Autoconfiguration for multiple MBRs  July 7, 2008


1. Introduction 

   The mobile ad hoc network (MANET) enables mobile nodes to communicate 
   via multiple wireless hops without the need of any wired 
   infrastructure. In a MANET, two nodes not within their transmission 
   range have to deliver data to each other through other intermediate 
   nodes. For forwarding packets destined to other nodes, each node must 
   have the routing capability, i.e., the mechanism for establishing 
   data delivery routes between any pair of source and destination 
   nodes. The IETF MANET working group has defined route setup 
   mechanisms for delivering data between MANET nodes. Especially for an 
   ad hoc network such as the MANET, the mechanism that can allow 
   nodes to configure their addresses autonomically is more desirable 
   than the static address configuration mechanism since the former has 
   less configuration and management overhead by not incurring manual 
   intervention.

   The MANET can be classified into the subordinate MANET or the 
   autonomous MANET depending on whether it is connected to the external 
   network or not[1]. The MANET border router (MBR) which is a gateway 
   device connecting the MANET with the external network has been 
   defined for the subordinate MANET. As the number of nodes in the MANET 
   increases, the amount of traffic between the MANET and the Internet 
   increases, so the MBR gets overloaded, resulting in the overall 
   network performance degradation. To overcome this problem, multiple 
   MBRs can be used for the Internet connectivity [2]. Mechanisms in 
   which each MBR advertises a different network prefix have been 
   proposed for the MANET with multiple MBRs[3-4]. However, in these 
   mechanisms, if a node moves to another place, it sends packets via 
   non-optimal paths to maintain its connection to the previous MBR, or 
   it changes its address by using the network prefix from the new MBR. 
   In the latter case, an on-going session may get terminated because
   of the address change.

   In this draft, we define a PMIPv6 based address autoconfiguration 
   mechanism that enables MANET nodes to operate properly in the case 
   when all MBRs advertise the same network prefix.

   The message exchange procedure among network components considered
   in this draft is shown in figure 1. The network is composed of an 
   external network such as the global Internet, a PMIPv6 domain and a 
   MANET. In the PMIPv6 network, there exists a local mobility 
   anchor (LMA) which acts like a home agent (HA) within the PMIPv6 
   domain[5]. The MANET is connected to the PMIPv6 domain by using 
   multiple MBRs, and each MBR acts as a mobility access gateway (MAG) 
   within the PMIPv6 domain. To the MANET, a single network prefix is 
   assigned, and each MBR periodically advertises the same network 
   prefix and the IPv6 address assigned to its MANET interface by using 
   the simplified multicast forwarding (SMF) message defined in [6]. 
   SMF messages transmitted by MBRs have the same network prefix and 
   the prefix length.

   A MANET node consists of a MANET router (MR) and (virtual) hosts[7].
   A MR has a MANET interface for connecting to the MANET and a host 
   interface for connecting to hosts. When a MR connects to the MANET 
   for the first time, it waits for SMF messages from MBRs for some time 
   duration which is determined by a given timer value. If the MR 
   receives SMF messages from multiple MBRs, it selects the MBR which
   can be reached via the minimum number of hops. If more than one MBRs 
   can be reached via the minimum hops, it selects one at random or 
   based on some other metrics. Let the MBR firstly chosen by the MR be 
   MBR1. The MR configures the IPv6 address of its MANET interface by 
   using the stateless address autoconfiguration mechanism based on the 
   network prefix included in the SMF message from MBR1 and its MAC 
   address, and sets MBR1 as its default gateway. Then, the MR obtains 
   a network prefix by using the DHCP with prefix delegation.

   The MR with the delegated network prefix allocates an IPv6 address 
   belonging to the delegated network prefix to the hosts connected to 
   itself. Also, the MR sends a Registration Request (RR) message with
   the delegated network prefix information to MBR1. The format of the
   RR message is defined in the section 2. From the received RR message,
   MBR1 stores the binding information of the network prefix and the
   address assigned to the MANET interface of the MR, and sends a proxy
   binding update (PBU) message to the LMA. Then, the LMA stores the
   binding information of the received network prefix and the MBR1
   address. The packets from hosts in the external network to the hosts
   connected to the MR are delivered to the LMA, first, and, then, the
   LMA forwards the received packets to MBR1 via the tunnel, and then,
   MBR1 forwards them to the MR.

   If the MR moves and receives a SMF message which has been broadcast 
   by another MBR (i.e., MBR2) and the difference between the number of 
   hops from MBR1 and that from MBR2 is larger than a given threshold,
   the MR changes its default gateway address information from MBR1 to 
   MBR2. After that, the MR sends a RR message to MBR2. Upon receiving 
   the RR message, MBR2 stores the binding information of the network 
   prefix and the IPv6 address assigned to the MANET interface of the 
   MR, and sends a PBU message to the LMA. Upon receiving the PBU 
   message, the LMA changes the binding information of the network 
   prefix information in the PBU message from MBR1 to MBR2. Then, the 
   packets from hosts in the external network to the MR are delivered 
   to MBR2 via the LMA through the tunnel. And, MBR2 forwards the 
   received packets to the MR.
