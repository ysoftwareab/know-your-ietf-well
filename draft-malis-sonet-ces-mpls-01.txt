                SONET/SDH Circuit Emulation Over MPLS       July 2000 
 
 
3. Introduction 
    
   This document describes a method for encapsulating time division 
   multiplexed (TDM) digital signals (TDM circuit emulation) for 
   transmission over a packet-oriented MPLS network. The transmission 
   system for circuit-oriented TDM signals is the Synchronous Optical 
   Network (SONET)[3]/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) [4]. To 
   support TDM traffic, which includes voice, data, and private leased 
   line service, the MPLS network must emulate the circuit 
   characteristics of SONET/SDH payloads.  MPLS labels and a new 
   circuit emulation header are used to encapsulate TDM signals and 
   provide the Circuit Emulation Service over MPLS (CEM). 
    
   This document is closely related to references [5], which describes 
   the control protocol methods used to signal the usage of CEM, and 
   [6], which describes a related method of encapsulating Layer 2 
   frames over MPLS and which shares the same signaling. 
    
    
4. Scope 
    
   This document describes how to provide CEM for the following digital 
   signals: 
    
   1. SONET STS-1 synchronous payload envelope (SPE)/SDH VC-3 
    
   2. STS-Nc SPE (N = 3, 12, or 48)/SDH VC-4, VC-4-4c, VC-4-16c 
    
   Other SONET/SDH signals, such as virtual tributary (VT) structured 
   sub-rate mapping, are not explicitly discussed in this document; 
   however, it can be extended in the future to support VT services. 
   OC-192c SPE/VC-4-64c are also not included at this point, since most 
   MPLS networks use OC-192c or slower trunks, and thus would not have 
   sufficient capacity.  As trunk capacities increase in the future, 
   the scope of this document can be accordingly extended. 
    
    
5. CEM Encapsulation Format 
    
   A TDM data stream is segmented into packets and encapsulated in MPLS 
   packets. Each packet has one or more MPLS labels, followed by a 32-
   bit CEM header to associate the packet with the TDM stream.  
    
   The outside label is used to identify the MPLS LSP used to tunnel 
   the TDM packets through the MPLS network (the tunnel LSP).  The 
   interior label is used to multiplex multiple TDM connections within 
   the same tunnel.  This is similar to the label stack usage defined 
   in [5] and [6].

   The 32-bit TDM header has the following format: 
    
      0                   1                   2                   3 
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      |   Payload Bytes   |   Struct Pointer  |N|P|  Seq num  | BIP-4 | 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
 
                        Figure 1. TDM Header Format 
    
    
   The above fields are defined as follows: 
    
   Payload Bytes(N): the number of TDM payload bytes contained in this 
   packet,  from 48 to 1,023 bytes.  All of the packets in a given CES 
   stream have the same number of payload bytes.  Note that there is a 
   possibility that the packet size may exceed the SPE size in the case 
   of an STS-1 SPE, which could cause two pointers to be needed in the 
   CEM header, since the payload may contain two J1 bytes for 
   consecutive SPEs.  For this reason, the number of payload bytes must 
   be less than 783 for STS-1 SPEs. 
    
   Structure Pointer: The pointer points to the J1 byte in the payload 
   area. The value is from 0 to 1,022, where 0 means the first byte 
   after the TDM header. The pointer is set to 0x3FF (1,023) if a 
   packet does not carry the J1 byte.  See [3] and [4] for more 
   information on the J1 byte and the structure pointer. 
    
   The N and P bits: See Section 7 below for their definition. 
    
   Seq Num:  This is a packet sequence number, which continuously 
   cycles from 0 to 63.  It begins at 0 when a TDM LSP is created. 
    
   BIP-4: The bit interleaved even parity is over the first 28 header 
   bits. 
    
 
6. Clocking Mode 
    
   It is necessary to be able to regenerate the input service clock at 
   the output interface.  Two clocking modes are supported: synchronous 
   and asynchronous. 
    
6.1 Synchronous 
    
   When synchronous SONET timing is available at both ends of the 
   circuit, the N(JE) and P(JE) bits are set for negative or positive 
   justification events. The event is carried in five consecutive 
   packets at the transmitter. The receiver plays out the event when 
   three out of five packets with NJE/PJE bit set are received. If both 
   bits are set, then path AIS event has occurred.  If there is a 
   frequency offset between the frame rate of the transport overhead 
   and that of the STS SPE, then the alignment of the SPE shall

   periodically slip back or advance in time through positive or 
   negative stuffing. The N(JE) and P(JE) bits are used to replay the 
   stuff indicators and eliminate transport jitter. 
    
6.2 Asynchronous 
    
   If synchronous timing is not available, the N and P bits are not 
   used for frequency justification and adaptive methods are used to 
   recover the timing. The N and P bits are only checked for the 
   occurrence of a path AIS event. An example adaptive method can be 
   found in Section 3.4.2 of [7]. 
 
 
7. CEM LSP Signaling 
    
   For maximum network scaling, CEM LSP signaling may be performed 
   using the LDP Extended Discovery mechanism as described in [5].  
   MPLS traffic tunnels may be dedicated to CEM, or shared with other 
   MPLS-based services.  The value 8008 is used for the VC Type in the 
   VC FEC Element defined in [5] in order to signify that the LSP being 
   signaled is to carry CEM.  Note that the sequencing control word in 
   [6] is not used, as its functionality is included in the CEM 
   encapsulation. 
    
   Alternatively, static label assignment may be used, or a dedicated 
   traffic engineered LSP may be used for each CEM circuit. 
    
    
8.  Open Issues 
    
   Future revisions of this draft will discuss QoS requirements and 
   mechanisms for CEM, methods to provide (or simulate) bi-directional 
   LSPs (perhaps using the Group ID from [5]), signaling for the number 
   of payload bytes, and sending additional end-to-end alarm 
   information in addition to AIS. 
 
 
9. Security Considerations 
 
   As with [5], this document does not affect the underlying security 
   issues of MPLS. 
    
    
10. Intellectual Property Disclaimer 
 
   This document is being submitted for use in IETF standards 
   discussions.  Vivace Networks, Inc. has filed one or more patent 
   applications relating to the CEM technology outlined in this 
   document.  Vivace Networks, Inc. will grant free unlimited licenses

   Appendix A. SONET/SDH Rates and Formats 
    
   For simplicity, the discussion in this section uses SONET 
   terminology, but it applies equally to SDH as well.  SDH-equivalent 
   terminology is shown in the tables. 
    
   The basic SONET modular signal is the synchronous transport signal-
   level 1 (STS-1). A number of STS-1s may be multiplexed into higher-
   level signals denoted as STS-N, with N synchronous payload envelopes 
   (SPEs). The optical counterpart of the STS-N is the Optical Carrier-
   level N, or OC-N. Table 1 lists standard SONET line rates discussed 
   in this document. 
    
    
     OC Level          OC-1    OC-3    OC-12      OC-48     OC-192 
     SDH Term             -   STM-1    STM-4     STM-16     STM-64 
     Line Rate(Mb/s) 51.840 155.520  622.080  2,488.320  9,953.280 
    
                    Table 1. Standard SONET Line Rates 
    
    
   Each SONET frame is 125 ´s and consists of nine rows. An STS-N frame 
   has nine rows and N*90 columns. Of the N*90 columns, the first N*3 
   columns are transport overhead and the other N*87 columns are SPEs. 
   A number of STS-1s may also be linked together to form a super-rate 
   signal with only one SPE. The optical super-rate signal is denoted 
   as OC-Nc, which has a higher payload capacity than OC-N. 
    
   The first 9-byte column of each SPE is the path overhead (POH) and 
   the remaining columns form the payload capacity with fixed stuff 
   (STS-Nc only).  The fixed stuff, which is purely overhead, is N/3-1 
   columns for STS-Nc.  Thus, STS-1 and STS-3c do not have any fixed 
   stuff, STS-12c has three columns of fixed stuff, and so on. 
    
   The POH of an STS-1 or STS-Nc is always nine bytes in nine rows. The 
   payload capacity of an STS-1 is 86 columns (774 bytes) per frame. 
   The payload capacity of an STS-Nc is (N*87)û(N/3) columns per frame.  
   Thus, the payload capacity of an STS-3c is (3*87 û 1)*9 = 2,340 
   bytes per frame. As another example, the payload capacity of an STS-
   192c is 149,760 bytes, which is exactly 64 times larger than the 
   STS-3c. 
    
   There are 8,000 SONET frames per second. Therefore, the SPE size, 
   (POH plus payload capacity) of an STS-1 is 783*8*8,000 = 50.112 
   Mb/s. The SPE size of a concatenated STS-3c is 2,349 bytes per frame 
   or 150.336 Mb/s. The payload capacity of an STS-192c is 149,760 
   bytes per frame, which is equivalent to 9,584.640 Mb/s. Table 2 
   lists the SPE and payload rates supported.

   defined in the next section, for carriage across MPLS networks.
