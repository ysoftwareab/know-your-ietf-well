   Abstract 
    
   This document specifies an RTP payload format for the transmission of 
   3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) timed text.  3GPP timed 
   text is time-lined decorated text media format whose defined storage 
   format is the ISO (International Standardisation Organisation) Base 
   Media File Format.  As of today, 3GP files containing timed text 
   contents can be downloaded via HTTP and be synchronised with 
   audio/video contents.  There is however no available mechanism for 
   streaming 3GPP timed text contents.  In the following sections the 
   problems of streaming timed text are addressed and a payload format 
   for streaming 3GPP timed text over RTP is specified.

2. Introduction 
    
   The purpose of this draft is to provide a means to stream the 3GPP 
   timed text using RTP. 
    
   3GPP timed text is a 3GP file format for time-lined decorated text 
   specified in [1].  The 3GP file format itself follows the ISO Base 
   Media File Format recommendation [2].  Besides plain text, the 3GPP 
   timed text format allows the display of decorated text (e.g. blinking 
   text, scrolling, hyperlinks) synchronised or not with other media.  
    
   The 3GPP timed text format was developed for 3GPP Transparent End-to-
   end Packet-switched Streaming Services (PSS) [1].  The scope of the 
   3GPP PSS includes downloading and streaming of multimedia content 
   over 3G packet-switched networks.  The PSS adopts multimedia codecs 
   (such as MPEG-4 Visual, AMR, MPEG-4 AAC, and JPEG) and protocols like 
   SMIL [9] for presentation layouts or RTP for streaming.  The current 
   usage of the 3GPP timed text file format is limited to downloading 
   via HTTP (with or without audio contents) due to the lack of an 
   appropriate RTP payload format. 
    
   In general, a multimedia presentation might consist of several 
   audio/video/text streams or tracks (in 3GP file format jargon).  
   Different tracks may have different contents and tracks of different 
   media may be spatially synchronised using the information within the 
   tracks or a scene description language like SMIL.  An example of this 
   would be a media session with three different media tracks: 1 audio, 
   1 video and 1 timed text that reproduces a music video with karaoke 
   subtitles.  The information contained in each track defines the 
   regions where each media is displayed, how the media looks like and 
   how it is synchronised, e.g., the song lyrics is displayed below the 
   video and the words are highlighted and synchronised with the 
   soundtrack. 
    
   Basically the 3GPP timed text format can be summarised as consisting 
   of four differentiated functional components: 
    
    - initial setup information for text tracks: these are the height 
   and width of the text region where the text track (contents) are 
   displayed, the translation offsets tx and ty relative to the video 
   track region and the layer or proximity of the text to the user.  In 
   the 3GPP timed text format, these pieces of information are extracted 
   from Track Header Box, "tkhd". 
    - general formatting information about the text track: default font, 
   default background colour, default horizontal and vertical 
   justification, default line width, default scrolling, etcetera.  In 
   the 3GPP timed text format, these pieces of information are extracted 
   from the Sample Description Box, "stsd". 
    - the actual text, conveyed as plain text using either UTF-8 or UTF-
   16 encoding and, 
     
   Rey & Matsui                                               [Page 3] 
   Internet Draft  RTP Payload Format for 3GPP Timed Text February 2004 
    
    
    - the "decoration": whether it is highlighted text, blinking text, 
   karaoke, hypertext, scroll delay, other text styles/formatting than 
   the defaults, etcetera.  In the 3GPP timed text format, these pieces 
   of information are extracted from the various Modifier Boxes: "hlit", 
   "hclr", "blnk", "krok", "href", "dlay", "styl" or "tbox". 
    
   For details refer to Annex A that summarises the basics of the 3GP 
   file format and to [1], where a more detailed description of the 
   setup information, format parameters and modifiers is contained. 
    
    
2.1 Requirements 
    
   In this section a set of requirements is listed.  A justification for 
   each of them is also given.  An RTP Payload Format for 3GPP timed 
   text SHALL: 
    
        1.  Keep the 3GP text sample structure.  A text sample consists 
   of the text length, the text string (either UTF-8 or UTF-16 encoded), 
   and one or several Modifier Boxes containing the text "decoration", 
   as defined in [1].  This is important to foster interoperability of 
   3GP file and RTP payload formats. 
    
        2.  Transmit the text sample size, sample duration and sample 
   description index in-band.  In RTP it is important to transmit it in-
   band because this information might change from sample to sample.  
   This is also important for buffering purposes as described in Section 
   4.1. 
    
        3.  Enable the transmission of the formatting information 
   (contained in the Sample Description Box, "stsd") by out-of-band and 
   in-band means.  In general, a single sample description may be used 
   by different text samples.  Therefore, to save overhead it is 
   sensible to transmit a default formatting once at the initialisation 
   phase and update this on demand.  On the other hand, these pieces of 
   information may become large so that out-of-band transmission might 
   not be the most appropriate method.  Also, out-of-band channels might 
   not be always available.  For these reasons, the payload format SHALL 
   enable also the in-band transmission of sample description 
   information.  This is especially useful for live streaming (where the 
   contents are not known a priori) or to protect this information 
   through other mechanisms like FEC [4] or retransmission [13].  RFC 
   2354 [8] discusses available mechanisms for packet loss resiliency. 
    
        4.  Enable the aggregation of text samples in one single RTP 
   packet.  In a mobile communication environment a typical text sample 
   size is around 100-200 bytes.  Thus, transporting several text 
   samples in one RTP packet makes the transport over RTP more 
   efficient. 
    
        5.  Enable the fragmentation and reassembly of a text sample 
   into several RTP packets in order to cover a wide range of 
   applications and network environments.  In general, fragmentation is 
     
   Rey & Matsui                                               [Page 4] 
   Internet Draft  RTP Payload Format for 3GPP Timed Text February 2004 
    
    
   a rare event given the low bit rates and text sample sizes.  However, 
   the 3GPP Timed Text media format allows for larger text samples and 
   so SHALL the payload format cover this possibility. 
    
        6.  Enable the use of resilient transport mechanisms, such as 
   repetition, retransmissions and FEC. 
    
    
3. Terminology 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [5]. 
    
   Furthermore, the following definitions are used in this document: 
    
    - text sample or whole text sample: this refers to a unit of text 
   data as contained in the source 3GP file.  Its equivalent in 
   audio/video would be an audio/video frame (see Section 14 for 
   details).  A text sample contains a text length indication, a text 
   string, and zero or several modifier boxes (the decoration of the 
   text).  
    - fragment or text sample fragment: a fraction of a text sample as 
   defined above. A fragment may either text strings and modifiers or 
   just one of these. 
    - sample contents: general term to identify timed text data 
   transported when using this payload format.  In addition to text 
   samples and fragments, it may also be used to refer to the sample 
   descriptions associated to the text samples.

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      |                                                               | 
      +                      RTP payload                              | 
      |                                                               | 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   Marker bit (M): the marker bit must be set to 1 if the RTP packet 
   includes the last fragment of a text sample; otherwise set to 0.  For 

     
   Rey & Matsui                                               [Page 5] 
   Internet Draft  RTP Payload Format for 3GPP Timed Text February 2004 
    
    
   RTP packets containing several text samples, being at least one of 
   them non-fragmented, the marker bit MUST be set to 1. 
    
   Timestamp: the timestamp indicates the sampling instant of the timed 
   text sample contained in the RTP packet.  The initial value is 
   randomly determined.  If the RTP packet includes more than one text 
   sample (i.e. text sample aggregation), the timestamp indicates the 
   sampling instant of the oldest text sample in the RTP packet.  The 
   samples MUST be placed in playout order, whereas the oldest sample is 
   placed first in the payload.  The timestamp of the subsequent samples 
   is obtained by adding the timed text sample duration (if present) to 
   the timestamp value.  For example, let sdur(0), sdur(1) and sdur(2) 
   be the durations of three subsequent timed text samples included in 
   an RTP packet.  Let rtpts be the timestamp as present in the RTP 
   header.  The timestamp ts(i) for each sample (i=0,1,2) would be:  
    
                ts(i)=rtpts + sum[sdur (i-1)]; 
                         
                   ts(0)=rtpts, 
                   ts(1)=rtpts +  sdur(0) 
                   ts(2)=rtpts + (sdur(0)+ sdur(1)) 
    
   Some text samples may become large and have to be fragmented and so 
   spread over several RTP packets.  In this case, the receiver needs to 
   associate fragments of the same text sample.  This is done using the 
   timestamp.  The order of the fragments is resolved using the fields 
   available in the following headers. 
    
   The value timestamp clockrate is copied directly from the 3GP file: 
   the value of "timescale" in the Media Header Box is to be used.  
    
   Payload Type (PT): the payload type is set dynamically and sent by 
   out-of-band means. 
    
   The usage of the remaining RTP header fields follows the rules of RTP 
   [3] and the profile in use. 
    
    
4.1 Fragmentation of Timed Text Samples 
    
   This section justifies why text samples MAY be fragmented and 
   discusses some of the possible approaches to do it.  A solution is 
   proposed together with rules and recommendations for fragmenting and 
   transporting text samples using this payload format. 
    
   3GPP Timed Text applications are expected to operate at low bit rates.  
   This fact added to the small size of timed text samples (typically 
   one or two hundred bytes) makes fragmentation of text samples a rare 
   event.  Samples should usually fit into the MTU size of the used 
   network path. 
    
   Nevertheless, the text string (e.g. ending roll in a movie) and some 
   modifier boxes, i.e. for hyperlinks ("href"), for karaoke ("krok") or 
     
   Rey & Matsui                                               [Page 6] 
   Internet Draft  RTP Payload Format for 3GPP Timed Text February 2004 
    
    
   for fonts ("styl") might become large and need fragmentation.  This 
   may also apply for future modifier boxes.  While the text string is 
   recommended as per [1] to take a maximum of 2048 bytes for maximum 
   client interoperability, there is no recommendation on the amount of 
   space occupied by modifier boxes. 
    
   In order to transport these larger text samples using RTP, it could 
   be argued that a careful encoding be used to transform the original 
   large sample into smaller self-contained text samples that fit into 
   the transport MTU.  This would comply with the ALF principle, as per 
   RFC 2367 [14].  It would also need additional pre-processing previous 
   to RTP encapsulation.  Given the low probability of fragmentation, it 
   is believed that the overhead of this pre-processing (careful 
   encoding) is not worth.  It appears more appropriate to encode text 
   samples without taking the path MTU into account.  In this manner, 
   this payload format meets a trade-off by intentionally leaving out 
   this pre-processing and making some text samples more sensitive to 
   packet losses. 
    
   However, a minimum set of fragmentation rules and recommendations 
   SHALL be observed to guarantee a minimum resiliency and guide in the 
   task of fragmentation.  Text samples and fragments thereof are 
   aggregated in the RTP payload according to the rules and 
   recommendations specified as follows:   
    
    - it is RECOMMENDED that text samples are fragmented as seldom as 
   possible.  E.g. if a previous packet has some free space and a new 
   text sample fits in one MTU, a new RTP packet SHOULD be sent, instead 
   of sending two or more fragments out of it.  In order to fill up the 
   remaining bits, piggybacking of sample descriptions MAY be performed. 
    
    - text strings MUST split at character boundaries.  Otherwise, it is 
   not possible to display the text of a fragment if the previous is 
   lost. 
    
    - it is RECOMMENDED to include as fewer text sample fragments as 
   possible in an RTP packet.  This reduces the effects of packet loss.  
   RTP packets using this payload format MAY include zero or more whole 
   text samples, zero or more text sample fragments and zero or more 
   sample descriptions. 
    
    - sample descriptions SHALL NOT be fragmented, since they contain 
   important information that may affect several text samples.   
    
    - for enhanced resiliency against packet loss it is RECOMMENDED that 
   fragments containing decoration are especially protected using FEC 
   [4], retransmission [13], packet repetition or a similar technique.   
    
    - when fragmenting text samples, the start of the decoration 
   (modifiers) MUST be indicated.  Otherwise, if packets are lost, a 
   client may be unable to identify where the modifiers start and the 
   text ends. 
    
     
   Rey & Matsui                                               [Page 7] 
   Internet Draft  RTP Payload Format for 3GPP Timed Text February 2004 
    
    
   Usually, RTP applications use the information on packet size from UDP 
   or lower layers to find out the length of the RTP payload.  This 
   means that if several text samples (or fragments) are contained in 
   the payload a length indication MUST be present for all fragments, 
   but the last one.  Similarly, those transported as unique payload do 
   not need of a length indication. 
    
   However, some transport schemes for RTP, e.g. RFC 3640 [15], require 
   that the length of each fragment is indicated.  This payload format 
   does not mandate to comply with such requirement, but OPTIONALLY 
   allows to do so.  Implementations subject to such requirement MUST 
   include an explicit length indication,i.e. the LEN field, by setting 
   the L bit in all cases.   
    
   Note also that the order of the text samples and fragments in the RTP 
   payload is important.  As described above in the definition of the 
   RTP timestamp usage, these MUST be placed chronologically in the RTP 
   payload, so that the SDUR field allows calculating the timestamp of 
   the samples following.  At the same time, other samples MAY follow if 
   the current and following samples contain each a length indication.  
   Otherwise, the sample is either placed at the end or as unique RTP 
   payload.  Fragments carrying modifier box contents and sample 
   descriptions MAY be placed in any order (no timing requirements) and 
   MAY be present as often as needed.  Modifier box fragments SHOULD be 
   placed as close as possible to the text strings, which they belong 
   to.

   Internet Draft  RTP Payload Format for 3GPP Timed Text February 2004 
    
    
   The payload headers specified in this document consist of a set of 
   common fields followed by specific fields for each header type.   
    
   The structure of the payload headers resembles that of the 'access 
   units' in RFC 3640.  This similarity is intentional, in order to ease 
   the transport using MPEG4 elementary streams.  In this manner, the 
   'AU header' of that document finds an equivalent in the common header 
   fields for all TYPE values: R, U, L, TYPE and LEN.  The specific 
   fields plus the sample contents would be similar to the 'AU data 
   section'. 
    
   The payload header the following format: 
    
       0                   1                   2                   3 
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      | R   |U|L|TYPE |             LEN (if L=1)      |   specific    | 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      |   fields (variable)...| 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                                         
    
   where, 
    
   - R (3 bits) "Reserved bits": this field MUST be set to zero.  
    
   - U (1 bit) "UTF Transformation": indicates whether the text 
   characters are encoded using UTF-8 (U=0) or UTF-16 (U=1).  It MUST 
   also be present in text sample fragments if they contain text 
   strings.  If  the payload does not carry text strings, this bit has 
   no meaning and SHALL be disregarded. 
    
   - L (1 bit) "Length Field" flag: if set indicates the presence of the 
   OPTIONAL length field, LEN.  By default this flag is reset.  Where 
   several 'access units' are included in an RTP packet, the length MUST 
   be used to parse the payload.  In this case, it SHALL be present in 
   all 'access units' but the last one.  In some cases, as in RFC 3640 
   [15], the length field is always needed, and so MUST L flag be always 
   set. 
    
   - LEN (16 bits) "Length Field": indicates the size (in bytes) of this 
   field and all the bits following, i.e. specific payload header fields 
   for each TYPE (excluding initial byte) plus the sample contents.  If 
   present, LEN has the following values: 
    
    - TYPE = 1, LEN >= 6,  
    - TYPE = 2, LEN > 9,  
    - TYPE = 3, LEN > 3,  
    - TYPE = 4, LEN > 3,  
    - TYPE = 5, LEN > 3.  
    
   For whole text samples (TYPE=1), the sample contents length 
   corresponds to the entry value in the Sample Size Box, "stsz" (see 
   also SLEN below).  Otherwise the sample contents length MUST be 
     
   Rey & Matsui                                               [Page 9]

   calculated when fragmenting the sample, in order to obtain the 
   correct LEN value.   
    
   Empty text samples do not have sample contents. For this case, TYPE 1 
   with a LEN of 6 (0x0006) MUST be used. 
    
   The following payload header compositions (including the specific 
   fields) result for the different values of TYPE: 
    
    - TYPE = 0,6 and 7 are reserved. 
    - TYPE = 1,  
    
       0                   1                   2                   3 
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      | R   |U|L|TYPE |       LEN (if L=1, always >=6)|    SIDX       | 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      |                      SDUR                     | 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   This header type is used to transport whole text samples.  If several 
   text samples are sent in an RTP packet, every sample has its own 
   header.   
    
   The LEN field MUST be always equal (for empty text samples) or 
   greater than 6 (0x0006). 
    
   The fields above have the following meaning: 
    
    - SIDX (8 bits) "Text Sample Entry Index": indicates the reference 
   index for the text sample, which corresponds to the index field in 
   the Sample to Chunk Box, "stsc", for the sample.  This field is used 
   to map the corresponding sample description information.  The SIDX is 
   unequivocally linked to one particular sample description.  
   Therefore, sample descriptions SHALL not be modified during a 
   streaming session.  A maximum of 126 SIDX values is allowed per text 
   stream.  To allow SIDX wrap-up, clients SHALL keep as valid only 
   those values of SIDX outside of the interval (X+128) modulo 255, 
   where X is the last SIDX value received.  The SIDX values 0 (0x00) 
   and 255 (0xff) are reserved for possible future extensions.   
    
    - SDUR (24 bits) "Text Sample Duration": indicates the sample 
   duration in timestamp units of the text sample, which corresponds to 
   the entry value in the Decoding Time to Sample Box, "stts", for that 
   sample.  This field allows by a clockrate of 1000 Hz a maximum 
   duration of approximately 279 hours (16 bits is would allow for just 
   65 seconds, which might be too short for some streams).   
    
   It is assumed that all text samples have a known duration at the time 
   of transmission.  In some cases however, e.g. live streaming, the 
   SDUR value might not be known.  To cover this exception, the value 
   zero (0x000000) is reserved to signal unknown duration.  For all 
   other cases SDUR MUST be different from 0x000000.   
     
   Rey & Matsui                                              [Page 10] 
   Internet Draft  RTP Payload Format for 3GPP Timed Text February 2004 
    
    
    
   The ordering of 'access units' in the RTP payload is important.  
   Logically, samples of unknown duration SHALL NOT precede any text 
   samples or text sample fragments in the RTP payload.  Otherwise it 
   would not be possible to find out the timestamp of these.  However, 
   samples of unknown duration MAY precede sample descriptions, as they 
   have no duration.   
    
   In general, text sample contents expire when the next sample becomes 
   valid.  As an exception, samples of unknown duration (SDUR=0x000000) 
   are valid until new packets arrive.  
    
   Note also, that samples of unknown duration SHALL NOT use features, 
   such as scrolling or karaoke, which would need to know the duration 
   of the sample up-front.

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   This header type is used to transport text sample fragments 
   containing text strings.  
    
   The LEN field (16 bits) has the same meaning as above. If present, 
   the length of LEN MUST be greater than a value of nine (0x0009).  
    
   The SLEN field (16 bits) indicates the size (in bytes) of the (whole) 
   text sample to which this fragment belongs.  As seen above, the text 
   sample length corresponds to the entry value in the Sample Size Box, 
   "stsz".  Clients MAY use SLEN to buffer space for the remaining 
   fragments of the text sample. 
    
   The fields TOTAL (4 bits) and THIS (4 bits) indicate the total number 
   of fragments in which the original text sample has been fragmented 
   and which order occupies the current fragment in that sequence, 
   respectively.  The usual 'byte offset' field is not used here for two 
   reasons: a) it would take one more byte and b) it does not provide 
   any useful information on the character offset.  UTF-8/16 text 
   strings have, in general, a variable character length ranging from 1 
   to 6 bytes.  Therefore, the TOTAL/THIS solution is preferred. 
    
   The R, U, L, TYPE, SIDX, and SDUR fields have identical 
   interpretation as above.  The U, SIDX and SDUR fields are useful 
   since partial text strings MAY also be displayed with the 
   corresponding decoration.

   This header type is used to transport either whole modifier boxes or 
   just the first fragment of these.  This depends on whether the 
   modifier boxes fit into one RTP packet.   
    
   In case fragmentation is needed, this header type identifies first 
   fragment.  As explained above, the rules for fragmentation require 
   that the start of the modifier boxes be signaled. 
    
   The R, U, L, TOTAL/THIS and LEN fields are used as above.  If present, 
   the LEN field MUST be greater than three (0x0003). 
    
   Note that the SLEN, SIDX and SDUR fields are not present.  This is 
   because: a) these fragments do not contain text strings and b) these 
   types of fragments are applied over text string fragments, which 
   already contain this information.

   This header type is used to transport sample descriptions.  The L 
   flag MUST be always set.  Consequently, the LEN field MUST be greater 
   than three (0x0003).  Every sample description MUST have its own TYPE 
   5 header. 
    
    
5. Resilient Transport 
    
   Apart from the basic fragmentation measures described in the section 
   above, the simplest option for packet loss resilient transport is to 
   send the same text samples (or fragments) again, i.e. repetition.  A 
   server MAY decide to send the same contents again as a measure for 
   error resilience.   
    
   Repetition of text samples (or fragments) is only allowed if exactly 
   the same RTP payloads are sent, so that a receiver can use original 
   and repeated fragments together to reconstruct the text samples.  If 
   a text sample was originally sent as non-fragmented text sample, a 
   repetition of that sample MUST be sent also as a single non-
   fragmented text sample.  Likewise, if the original text sample was 
   fragmented and spread over several RTP packets, repeated fragments 
   SHALL also be observe the same byte boundaries and use the same 
   headers and bytes per fragment.  Finally, if several text samples 
   resolve to the same timestamp, the receiver SHOULD use the one 
   received in the RTP packet with the highest sequence number and 
   discard the rest.   
    
   In repeated text samples (or fragments), all RTP header fields MUST 
   keep their original values except the sequence number that MUST be 
   increased to comply with RTP.   
    
    
6. Congestion control 
    
   The RTP profile under which this payload format is used defines an 
   appropriate congestion control mechanism in different environments.  
   Following the rules under the profile, an RTP application can 
   determine its acceptable bitrate and packet rate in order to be fair 
   to other TCP or RTP flows. 
    
   If an RTP application using this payload format uses retransmission, 
   the acceptable packet rate and bitrate includes both the original and 
   retransmitted data.  This guarantees that an application using 
   retransmission achieves the same fairness as one that does not.  Such 
   a rule may translate in practice into the following actions: 
    
   If enhanced service is used, it should be made sure that the total 
   bitrate and packet rate do not exceed that of the requested service.  
   It should be further monitored that the requested services are 
   actually delivered.  In a best-effort environment, the sender SHOULD 
   NOT send retransmission packets without ensuring first that enough 
   bandwidth for retransmission is available.  Other solutions like 

     
   Rey & Matsui                                              [Page 13] 
   Internet Draft  RTP Payload Format for 3GPP Timed Text February 2004 
    
    
   reducing the packet rate and bitrate of the original stream (for 
   example by encoding the data at a lower rate) MAY be used.  
    
   Similar considerations apply, if an RTP application using this 
   payload format implements forward error correction, FEC [4].  Hereby, 
   the sender should take care that the amount of FEC does not actually 
   worsen the problem. 
    
   Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that applications implementing this 
   payload format also implement congestion control.  The actual 
   mechanism for congestion control is out of the scope of this document 
   but should be suitable for real-time flows.  As an example, RFC 3448 
   [11] specifies an equation-based congestion control that fulfils this 
   requirement. 
    
    
7. SMIL usage 
    
   The SMIL recommendation [9] specifies a means for synchronising 
   different media streams. 
    
   This payload format defines the spatial layout parameters for a timed 
   text stream.  These specify the location of the text display area 
   relative to the top left corner of the video display area, when a 
   text stream is played with a single video stream without SMIL.  In 
   cases where several media streams shall be synchronized, SMIL MAY be 
   used to specify the spatial layout parameters. 
    
   It shall be noted that even if SMIL scene description is used the 
   track header information pieces SHOULD be sent anyway as they 
   represent the intrinsic media properties. 
    
    
8. MIME Type usage Registration 
    
8.1 3GPP Timed Text MIME Registration 
    
   MIME type: video 
    
   MIME subtype: 3gpp-tt 
    
   Required parameters: 
    
        rate: the RTP timestamp clockrate is equal to the clockrate of 
        the media.  The value timestamp clockrate is copied directly 
        from the 3GP file: the value of "timescale" in the Media Header 
        Box is to be used. 
    
        brand=<brand-name>, where <brand-name> identifies a Release 
        specification of 3GPP Timed Text being transmitted over RTP.  A 
        brand indicates the "best use" of the contents: the brand value 
        "3gp5" indicates Release 5 of 3GPP Technical Specification (TS) 
        26.245 [1].

        tx3g=<base64-value-1>, <base64-value-2>,... where <base64-value-
        i> represents a list of sample description entries using base64 
        encoding.  This parameter MAY be used to convey sample 
        descriptions out-of-band.  The list of sample entries is not 
        required to follow any particular order.  Each value <base64-
        value-i> represents the concatenation of the SIDX and sample 
        descriptions contents for that SIDX.  The LEN field is not 
        needed. 
         
        width=<integer-value> indicates the width in pixels of the text 
        track or area where the text is actually displayed. 
         
        height=<integer-value> indicates the height in pixels of the 
        text track. 
         
        tx=<integer-value>, indicates the horizontal translation offset 
        in pixels of the text track with respect to the origin of the 
        video track. 
         
        ty=<integer-value>, indicates the vertical translation offset in 
        pixels of the text track. 
         
        layer=<integer-value>, indicates the proximity of the text track 
        to the viewer.  Higher values means closer to the viewer.  This 
        parameter has no units. 
         
   Optional parameters: 
    
        mver=<version-value>, "Minor version" where <version-value> is a 
        positive integer.  It identifies the oldest compatible version.  
        How the version is defined can be found in TS 26.245 "3GPP 
        Transparent end-to-end packet switched streaming service (PSS); 
        Timed Text Format (Release 6)". 
         
        cbrand=<value1,value2,...>, "List of Compatible Brands" where 
        value1 is a brand.  This list MUST at least contain the <brand-
        name> as in "brand".

9. SDP usage 
    
   This document defines the MIME subtype name "3gpp-tt" and introduces 
   several REQUIRED payload-format-specific parameters: "brand", 
   "width", "height", "tx", "ty", "layer", "spldesc" and "tx3g" and two 
   OPTIONAL parameters "mver" and "cbrand". 
    
9.1 Mapping to SDP 
    
   The information carried in the MIME media type specification has a 
   specific mapping to fields in SDP [4], which is commonly used to 
   describe RTP sessions.  When SDP is used to specify transmission 
   using this payload format, the mapping is done as follows: 
    
   -  The MIME type ("video") goes in the SDP "m=" as the media name.  
   The "video" MIME Type is used as timed text is considered visual 
   media. 
    
   -  The MIME subtype ("3gpp-tt") goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as the 
   encoding name.  The value timestamp clockrate is copied directly from

   Internet Draft  RTP Payload Format for 3GPP Timed Text February 2004 
    
    
   the 3GP file, the value of "timescale" in the Media Header Box is to 
   be used.  Other values MAY be specified by out-of-band means. 
     
   -  The REQUIRED payload-format-specific parameters "brand", "width", 
   "height", "tx", "ty", "layer", "tx3g" and "spldesc" go in the SDP 
   "a=fmtp" as a semicolon separated list of parameter=<value> (or 
   parameter=<value1,value2,value3> for "tx3g") pairs. 
    
   -  The OPTIONAL payload-format-specific parameters "mver", "cbrand" 
   go in the SDP "a=fmtp" as a semicolon-separated list of 
   parameter=<value> pairs. 
    
   -  Any remaining parameters go in the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute by 
   copying them directly from the MIME media type string as a semicolon 
   separated list of parameter=value pairs. 
    
   In the following sections some example SDP descriptions are 
   presented. 
    
    
10. Examples of RTP packet structure 
    
   In this section, some examples of RTP packet structure are explained 
   for better understanding of this payload format.  The wrap-around of 
   the long lines is indicated by the backslash character "\".  The 
   examples assume aggregate control of stream container files.  The 
   session descriptions are not complete but limited to the example 
   purposes.

11. IANA Considerations 
    
   This document introduces the MIME subtype name "3gpp-tt" in Section 
   8.  
    
    
12. Security considerations 
    
   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification 
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP 
   specification [3].  This implies that confidentiality of the media 
   streams is achieved by encryption.  
    
   Furthermore, the main security issues are confidentiality and 
   authentication of the text itself.  The payload format itself does 
   not have any support for security.  These issues have to be solved by 
   a payload external mechanism, e.g. SRTP [10].

14. Annex A Basics of 3GP File Structure 
    
   Each 3GP file consists of "Boxes".  Boxes start with a header which 
   indicates both size and type contained.  The 3GP file contains the 
   File Type Box (ftyp), the Movie Box (moov), and the Media Data Box 
   (mdat).  The Movie Box and the Media Data Box, serving as containers, 
   include own boxes for each media.  Similarly, each box type may 
   include a number of boxes, see ISO Base Media file Format [2] for a 
   complete list of possibilities. 
    
   In the following, only those boxes are mentioned, which are useful 
   for the purposes of this payload format. 
    
   The File Type Box identifies the type and properties of a 3GP file.  
   The File Type Box contents comprise the major brand, the minor 
   version and the compatible brands.  These are communicated via out-
   of-band means, such as SDP, when streamed with RTP.  For the 3GPP 
   timed text file format, the set of compatible-brands MUST include 
   "3gp5". 
    
   The Movie Box contains one or more Track Boxes (trak) which include 
   information about each track.  A Track Box contains, among others, 
   the Track Header Box (tkhd), the Media Header Box (mdhd) and the 
   Media Information Box (minf).  The Media Header Box contains the 
   timescale or number of time units that pass in one second.  The Media 
   Information Box includes the Sample Table Box (stbl) which itself 
   contains the Sample Description Box (stsd), the Decoding Time to 
   Sample Box (stts), the Sample Size Box (stsz) and the Sample to Chunk 
   Box (stsc).  Sample descriptions for each text sample are encoded as 
   "tx3g" sample entries in the Sample Description Box (stsd).  
    
   The Track Header Box specifies the characteristics of a single track, 
   where a track is, in this case, the streamed text during a session.  
   Exactly one Track Header Box is needed for a track.  It contains 
   information about the track, such as the spatial layout (width and 
   height), the video transformation matrix and the layer number.  Since 
   these pieces of information are essential and static, i.e. constant 
   for the duration of the session, they MUST be sent prior to the 
   transmission of any text samples.  See the ISO base media file format 
   [2] for details about the definition of the conveyed information. 
    
   When using scene description in SMIL [9], it is possible to specify 
   the layer and the position of the text track.  However, in this case, 
   the transmission of the Track Header Box (tkhd) is still RECOMMENDED, 
   as the intrinsic track information is specified there.  Otherwise, 
   the Track Header Box information MUST be sent prior to the start of 
   the text streaming.

   Internet Draft  RTP Payload Format for 3GPP Timed Text February 2004 
    
    
   The Sample Table Box (stbl) contains all the time and data indexing 
   of the media samples in a track.  Using the tables here, it is 
   possible to locate samples in time, determine their type, and 
   determine their size, container, and offset into that container.  
   From the Sample Table Box (stbl) the following information is carried 
   in each RTP packet using this payload format: the Sample Description 
   Box (stsd), the Decoding Time to Sample Box (stts), the Sample Size 
   Box (stsz) and the Sample to Chunk Box (stsc).  The Decoding Time to 
   Sample Box (stts) is mapped to the field SDUR (Text Sample Duration); 
   the Sample Size Box (stsz) is mapped the field SLEN (Text Sample 
   Length) and the Sample to Chunk Box is mapped to the field SIDX (Text 
   Sample Entry Index).  The Sample to Chunk Box (stsc) associates the 
   text sample and its corresponding sample description entry in the 
   Sample Description Box (stsd, see below).  The Sample to Chunk Box 
   can be used to associate a text sample with a sample description 
   entry.  Since the sample description may vary during the session, the 
   association SDIX must be sent together with the text samples using 
   this payload format. 
    
   The Sample Description Box (stsd) provides information on the basic 
   characteristics of text samples.  Each entry is a sample entry box of 
   type "tx3g".  An example of the information contained in a sample 
   entry could be the font size or the background colour.  Since these 
   pieces of information are commonly used by many text samples during 
   the session, it is sent by out-of-bands means.  A complete list of 
   text characteristics can be found in [1].  
    
   Finally, the Media Data Box contains the media data itself.  In 3GPP 
   timed text tracks this box contains text samples.  Its equivalent to 
   audio and video is audio and video frames, respectively.  The text 
   sample consists of the text length, the text string, and one or 
   several Modifier Boxes.  The text length is the size of the text in 
   bytes.  The text string is plain text to render.  The Modifier Box is 
   information to render in addition to the text such as colour, font, 
   etc.
