Abstract

   Along with providing support for certain basic authentication,
   authorization and accounting functions, the Diameter base protocol is
   intended to provide a framework for AAA applications.

   This document defines the Management Information Base (MIB) module
   which describes the minimum set of objects needed to manage an
   implementation of the Diameter Credit Control application.

1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].  In particular, it describes managed objects used for
   managing the Diameter base protocol.

   Discussion of this draft may be directed to the authors.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Overview

   The base Diameter protocol [RFC3588] is never used alone; it is
   always extended for a particular application.  Four standard Diameter
   applications have been defined to date: NASREQ [RFC4005], Mobile IP
   [RFC4004] [RFC3141], Credit Control [RFC4006] and EAP [RFC4072];
   others may be defined in the future.

   This MIB defines objects supporting the management of the Diameter
   Credit Control Application protocol as described in [RFC4006].  The
   MIB specification for the Diameter base protocol [BASEMIB] SHOULD be
   implemented prior to the implementation of this MIB.

       DESCRIPTION
               "The status of this conceptual row.

               To create a row in this table, a manager must
               set this object to either createAndGo(4) or
               createAndWait(5).

               Until instances of all corresponding columns
               are appropriately configured, the value of the
               corresponding instance of the
               dccaPeerRowStatus column is 'notReady'.

               In particular, a newly created row cannot be
               made active until the corresponding dccaPeerId
               has been set.

               dccaPeerId may not be modified while the
               value of this object is active(1):
               An attempt to set these objects while the value
               of dccaPeerRowStatus is active(1) will result
               in an inconsistentValue error.

               Entries in this table with dccaPeerRowStatus
               equal to active(1) remain in the table until
               destroyed.

               Entries in this table with dccaPeerRowStatus
               equal to values other than active(1) will be
               destroyed after timeout (5 minutes).

               If a dccaPeerId being created via SNMP already
               exists in another active dccaPeerEntry, then a
               newly created row
               cannot be made active until the original row
               with the dccaPeerId value is destroyed.

                To create a row in this table, a manager must
                set this object to either createAndGo(4) or
                createAndWait(5).

                Until instances of all corresponding columns
                are appropriately configured, the value of the
                corresponding instance of the
                dccaPeerVendorRowStatus column is 'notReady'.

                In particular, a newly created row cannot be
                made active until the corresponding
                dccaPeerVendorId has been set.

                value of dccaPeerVendorRowStatus is active(1)
                will result in an inconsistentValue error.

                Entries in this table with
                dccaPeerVendorRowStatus equal to

                If the peer vendor id being created via SNMP
                already exists

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign an OID under mib-2.


6.  Security Considerations

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), there is no control as
   to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET (read) the
   objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model [RFC3414] and the View-based Access
   Control Model [RFC3415] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/
   create/delete) them.
