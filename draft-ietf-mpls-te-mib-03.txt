Abstract
   
   This memo defines an experimental portion of the
   Management Information Base  (MIB) for use with
   network management protocols in the Internet
   community.  In particular, it describes managed
   objects for Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)
   [MPLSArch] [MPLSFW] based traffic engineering.


1. Introduction
   
   This memo defines an experimental portion of the
   Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network
   management protocols in the Internet community. In
   particular, it describes managed objects for modeling
   a Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)
   [MPLSArch][MPLSFW] based traffic engineering. This MIB
   should be used in conjunction with the companion
   document [LSRMIB] for MPLS based traffic engineering
   configuration and management.

   Comments should be made directly to the MPLS mailing
   list at mpls@uu.net.
   
   This memo does not, in its draft form, specify a
   standard for the Internet community.


2. Terminology
   
   This document uses terminology from the MPLS
   architecture document [MPLSArch] and MPLS Label Switch
   Router MIB [LSRMIB]. Some frequently used terms are
   described next.
   
   An explicitly routed LSP (ERLSP) is referred to as an
   MPLS tunnel.  It consists of one in-segment and/or one
   out-segment at the ingress/egress LSRs, each segment
   being associated with one MPLS interface.  These are
   also referred to as tunnel segments.  Additionally, at
   an intermediate LSR, we model a connection as
   consisting of one or more in-segments and/or one or
   more out-segments.  The binding or interconnection
   between in-segments and out-segments in performed
   using a cross-connect. These objects are defined in
   the MPLS Label Switch Router MIB [LSRMIB].


3. The SNMP Management Framework
   
   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of
   five major components:

   -  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271
      [SNMPArch].
   
   -  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and
      events for the purpose of management.  The first
      version of this Structure of Management
      Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
      RFC 1155 [SMIv1], RFC 1212 [SNMPv1MIBDef] and RFC
      1215 [SNMPv1Traps].  The second version, called
      SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [SMIv2], RFC 1903
      [SNMPv2TC] and RFC 1904 [SNMPv2Conf].
   
   -  Message protocols for transferring management
      information.  The first version of the SNMP
      message protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in
      RFC 1157 [SNMPv1].  A second version of the SNMP
      message protocol, which is not an Internet
      standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and
      described in RFC 1901 [SNMPv2c] and RFC 1906
      [SNMPv2TM].  The third version of the message
      protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC
      1906 [SNMPv2TM], RFC 2272 [SNMPv3MP] and RFC 2574
      [SNMPv3USM].
   
   -  Protocol operations for accessing management
      information.  The first set of protocol operations
      and associated PDU formats is described in RFC
      1157 [SNMPv1].  A second set of protocol
      operations and associated PDU formats is described
      in RFC 1905 [SNMPv2PO].
   
   -  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC

      2273 [SNMPv3App] and the view-based access control
      mechanism described in RFC 2575 [SNMPv3VACM].
   
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information
   store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms
   defined in the SMI.  This memo specifies a MIB module
   that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A MIB conforming to
   the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be
   semantically equivalent, except where objects or
   events are omitted because no translation is possible
   (use of Counter64).  Some machine-readable information
   in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions
   in SMIv1 during the translation process.  However,
   this loss of machine-readable information is not
   considered to change the semantics of the MIB.


3.1.  Object Definitions
   
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information
   store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of
   Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the
   SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.
   The object type together with an object instance
   serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation
   of the object.  For human convenience, we often use a
   textual string, termed the descriptor, to also refer
   to the object type.

4. Feature Checklist
   
   The MPLS traffic engineering MIB is designed to
   satisfy the following requirements and constraints.
   
   -  The MIB must support the configuration of point-to-
      point unidirectional tunnels.
   
   -  The MIB should be able to support the configuration
      of point-to-point bi-directional tunnels.
   
   -  The MIB should be able to support the configuration
      of multi-point-to-point unidirectional tunnels.
   
   -  MPLS tunnels need not be interfaces, but it should
      be possible to configure a tunnel as an interface.
   
   - The MIB should be able to support both manually
      configured MPLS tunnels as well as those set up
      via any MPLS signaling protocol.
   
   -  It should be possible to support persistent as well
      as non-persistent tunnels.


5. Outline
   
   Traffic engineering support for MPLS tunnels requires
   the following configuration.
   



Srinivasan, et al.           Expires September 2000          [Page 6]


Internet Draft       MPLS Traffic Engineering MIB       10 March 2000



   -  Setting up MPLS tunnels along with appropriate
      configuration parameters.
   
   -  Configuring tunnel loose and strict source routed
      hops.
   
   These actions may need to be accompanied with
   corresponding actions using [LSRMIB] to establish and
   configure tunnel segments, if this is done manually.
   Also, the in-segment and out-segment performance
   tables, mplsInSegmentPerfTable and
   mplsOutSegmentPerfTable [LSRMIB], should be used to
   determine performance of the tunnels and tunnel
   segments.


5.1.  Summary of Traffic Engineering MIB
   
   The MIB objects for performing these actions consist
   of the following tables.
   
   -  Tunnel table (mplsTunnelTable) for setting up MPLS
      tunnels.
   
   -  Tunnel hop table (mplsTunnelHopTable) for configuring
     strict and loose source routed MPLS tunnels hops.
   
   -  Resource table (mplsTunnelResourceTable) for
     setting up the tunnel resources.
   
   -  Tunnel Actual Route Table (mplsTunnelARHopTable)
     for viewing the actual route used by the tunnel.

Internet Draft       MPLS Traffic Engineering MIB       10 March 2000



   
   These tables are described in the subsequent sections.


6. Brief Description of MIB Objects
   
   The objects described in this section support the
   functionality described in documents [RSVPTun][CR-
   LDP].  The tables support both manually configured and
   signaled tunnels.  Moreover, they provide the
   capability to associate two unidirectional tunnels to
   form a single bi-directional tunnel.


6.1.  mplsTunnelTable
   
   The mplsTunnelTable allows new MPLS tunnels to be
   created between an MPLS LSR and a remote endpoint, and
   existing tunnels to be reconfigured or removed.  Note
   that we only support point-to-point tunnel segments,
   although multi-point-to-point and point-to-multi-point
   connections are supported by an LSR acting as a cross-
   connect.  Each MPLS tunnel can thus have one out-
   segment originating at an LSR and/or one in-segment
   terminating at that LSR.
   
   mplsTunnelTable does not define the in and out
   segments forming the tunnel.  Instead, these are
   defined by creating rows in the in-segment and out-
   segment tables, defining relationships in the cross-
   connect table and referring to these rows in the
   mplsTunnelTable using a cross-connect index,



Srinivasan, et al.           Expires September 2000          [Page 8]


Internet Draft       MPLS Traffic Engineering MIB       10 March 2000



   mplsTunnelXCID. These segment and cross-connect
   related objects are defined in [LSRMIB].


6.2.  mplsTunnelHopTable
   
   mplsTunnelHopTable is used to indicate the hops,
   strict or loose, for an MPLS tunnel defined in
   mplsTunnelTable, when it is established via signaling.
   Each row in this table is indexed primarily by the
   same index mplsTunnelIndex as the row of the
   corresponding tunnel in mplsTunnelTable.  Each row
   also has a secondary index, mplsTunnelHopIndex,
   corresponding to the next hop of this tunnel.  The
   scalar mplsTunnelMaxHops indicates the maximum number
   of hops that can be specified on each tunnel supported
   by this LSR.


6.3.  mplsTunnelResourceTable
   
   mplsTunnelResourceTable is used to indicate the
   resources required for a tunnel. Multiple tunnels may
   share the same resource by pointing to the same entry
   in this table. Tunnels that do not share resources
   must point to separate entries in this table.


6.4.  mplsTunnelARHopTable
   
   mplsTunnelARHopTable is used to indicate the actual
   route taken by a tunnel. This table is particularly



Srinivasan, et al.           Expires September 2000          [Page 9]


Internet Draft       MPLS Traffic Engineering MIB       10 March 2000



   useful in cases where tunnel hops are loosely routed.
   This table will allow the user to see the actual path
   taken by the tunnel through the network. Support of
   this tunnel is dependent upon the MPLS signaling
   protocols providing this information.


7. Example of Tunnel Setup

   This section contains an example of which MIB objects
   should be modified if one would like to create
   loosely routed, unidirectional traffic engineered
   tunnel, which spans two hops of a simple network.
   Note that these objects should be created on the
   "head-end" LSR.
   
   In mplsTunnelTable:
   {
     mplsTunnelIndex             = 1,
     mplsTunnelInstance          = 1,
     mplsTunnelName              = "My first tunnel ",
     mplsTunnelDescr             = "Here to there",
     mplsTunnelIsIf              = true (1),
     mplsTunnelIfIndex           = 12,

     mplsTunnelResourceEntryIndex= 5,
     mplsTunnelInstancePriority  = 1,
     mplsTunnelRowStatus         = createAndGo (4)
   }
   
   In mplsTunnelResourceTable:
   {
     mplsTunnelResourceIndex     = 5,
     mplsTunnelInMaxRate         = 100,
     mplsTunnelInMeanRate        = 100,
     mplsTunnelInMaxBurstSize    = 100,
     mplsTunnelOutMaxRate        = 100,
     mplsTunnelOutMeanRate       = 100,
     mplsTunnelOutMaxBurstSize   = 100,
     mplsTunnelResourceRowStatus = createAndGo (4)
   }
   
   The next two instances of mplsTunnelHopEntry are used
   to denote the hops this tunnel will take across the
   network. Note that mplsTunnelIndex,
   mplsTunnelInstance, and mplsTunnelHopIndex are used to
   index these objects. For the purposes of this example,
   all entries in the MplsTunnelHopTable will use the
   index of 1, which was defined for the mpslTunnelEntry
   above.
   
   The following denotes the beginning of the network, or
   the first hop. We have used the fictitious LSR

     mplsTunnelHopIpv4PrefixLen      = 9,
     mplsTunnelHopStrictOrLoose      = loose (2),
     mplsTunnelHopRowStatus          = createAndGo (4)
   }
   
   The following denotes the end of the network, or the
   last hop in our example. We have used the fictitious
   LSR identified by "123.123.126.1" as our end router.

MplsLabel ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
   STATUS        current
   DESCRIPTION
       "Represents an MPLS label.  Note that the
        contents of a label field are interpreted in an
        interface-type specific fashion.  For example,
        the label carried in the MPLS shim header is 20
        bits wide and the top 12 bits must be zero.  The
        frame relay label can be either 10, 17 or 23
        bits wide depending on the size of the DLCI
        field size and the top 22, 15, or 9 bits must be
        zero, respectively.  For an ATM interface, the
        lowermost 16 bits are interpreted as the VCI,
        the next 8 bits as the VPI and the remaining
        bits must be zero.  Also note the permissible
        label values are also a function of the
        interface type.  For example, the value 3 has
        special semantics in the control plane for an
        MPLS shim header label and is not a valid label

9. Security Considerations
   
   There are a number of management objects defined in
   this MIB that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write



Srinivasan, et al.          Expires September 2000          [Page 60]


Internet Draft       MPLS Traffic Engineering MIB       10 March 2000



   and/or read-create. Such objects may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
   The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a
   negative effect on network operations.
   
   It is thus important to control even GET access to
   these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values
   of these object when sending them over the network
   via SNMP. Not all versions of SNMP provide features
   for such a secure environment.
   
   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if
   the network itself is secure (for example by using
   IPSec [IPSEC]), there is no control as to who on the
   secure network is allowed to access and GET/SET
   (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.
   It is recommended that the implementers consider the
   security features as provided by the SNMPv3
   framework. Specifically, the use of the User-based
   Security Model [SNMPv3USM] and the View- based Access
   Control [SNMPv3VACM] is recommended. It is then a
   customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is
   properly configured to give access to the objects
   only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete)
   them.
