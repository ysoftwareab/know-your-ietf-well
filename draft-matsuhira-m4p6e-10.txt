1.  Introduction

   This document provides Multiple IPv4 address and port number - IPv6
   address mapping encapulation (M4P6E) base specification.

   M4P6E provide IPv4 address sharing function without Network Address
   Translation (NAT [RFC1631]).  M4P6E require IPv6 network.


2.  Architecture of M4P6E

   Figure 1 shows M4P6E address architecture.  M4P6E address consists
   four parts, M4P6E prefix, IPv4 network plane ID, IPv4 address, and
   Port number.


   |                      |                |                |         |
   |    80 - m bits       |   m bits       |    32 bits     | 16 bits |
   +----------------------+----------------+----------------+----:----+
   |  M4P6E prefix        | IPv4 network   |  IPv4 address  |  port   |
   |                      | plane ID       |                | number  |
   +----------------------+----------------+----------------+----:----+
   |<--------------- Locator (128 -n bits  )-------------------->:<-->|
   |                                                             : ID |
   |                                                            (n bits)


                                 Figure 1

   In M4P6E, boundary of locator and identifier is in port number part,
   that mean, M4P6E use upper part of port number as locator, and lower
   part of port number as identifier.


3.  M4P6E address format

   Figure 2 show a example of M4P6E address format.  In this example,
   16bits IPv4 network plane ID is used, that provide 65535 IPv4 network
   plane.



    | 3 |      45bits      |  16bits |  16 bits|   32bits   | 16 bits |
    +---+------------------+---------+---------+------------+---------+
    |001|  routing prefix  |subnet id| plane ID|IPv4 address| Port #  |
    +---+------------------+---------+----------------------+---------+

4.  Using M4P6E in client server environments

4.1.  Client environments

   Figure 3 shows a example of M4P6E usage in client environments.  In
   this document, NAPT is IPv4 - IPv4 Netowrk address and port number
   translator.  Coopetation with NAPT, M4P6E provide IPv4 address
   sharing with different users.

4.2.  Server environments

   Figure 4 shows an example of M4P6E usage in server environments.  In
   this example, server terminate M4P6E tunnel.  This case, Server
   require at least one port number per server, that mean, 128bits host
   route advertise for server access via IPv4.  This case, full access
   is provided via IPv6.

4.3.  Data Center Environments

   Figure 5 shows an example of M4P6E usage in Data Center environments.
   In this example, M4P6E is used only in Data Center Backend Network
   closely.  Client which is connected via backbone network does not
   know the exists of M4P6E. M4P6E can provide at least one port number
   per server, this case, 128bits host route is advertised, however this
   route in advertised only in data center backbone network.  Ofcource,
   IPv6 address may allocated to the server, so full access is provided
   via IPv6.

5.  Port Number Issue

   M4P6E require port number of transport layer.  M4P6E can not support
   ICMPv4 [RFC0792].  The function provided by ICMPv4 does not work in
   M4P6E environments, such as Path MTU Discovery [RFC1191], ping
   command, etc.

   M4P6E can not also support IPv4 IPsec ESP [RFC4303] because transport
   header is encrypted.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.

7.  Security Considerations

   M4P6E use automatic tunneling technologies.  Security consideration
   related tunneling technologies are discussed in RFC2893 [RFC2893],
