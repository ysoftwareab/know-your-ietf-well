Abstract

This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for
use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.  In
particular it defines objects for managing MAC bridges based on the IEEE
802.1D-1998 MAC Bridges and IEEE 802.1Q-1998 Virtual LAN (VLAN)
standards for bridging between Local Area Network (LAN) segments.

Provisions are made for support of transparent bridging.  Provisions are
also made so that these objects apply to bridges connected by
subnetworks other than LAN segments.  This memo also includes several
MIB modules in a manner that is compliant to the SNMPv2 SMI [5].




1.  The SNMP Management Framework

The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [1].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        RFC 1155 [2], RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].  The second
        version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [5], RFC 1903
        [6] and RFC 1904 [7].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in RFC 1157 [8].  A second version of the SNMP message
        protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is
        called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
        The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and
        described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2272 [11] and RFC 2274 [12].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in RFC 1157 [8].  A second set of protocol operations
        and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [14] and
        the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2275
        [15].

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are defined
using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A MIB
conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate

translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
MIB.

2.  Overview

A common device present in many networks is the Bridge.  This device is
used to connect Local Area Network segments below the network layer.
These devices are often known as 'layer 2 switches'.

There are two major modes defined for this bridging; transparent and
source route.  The transparent method of bridging is defined by IEEE
802.1D-1998 [19].  Managed objects for source route bridges are defined
in [23].

IEEE 802.1D is augmented by IEEE 802.1Q-1998 [20] to provide support for
'virtual bridged LANs' where a single bridged physical LAN network may
be used to support multiple logical bridged LANs, each of which offers a
service approximately the same as that defined by 802.1D.  Such virtual
LANs (VLANs) are an integral feature of switched LAN networks.  A VLAN
can be viewed as a group of end-stations on multiple LAN segments and
can communicate as if they were on a single LAN.  IEEE 802.1Q defines
port-based Virtual LANs where membership is determined by the bridge
port on which data frames are received.  This memo defines the objects
needed for the management of port-based VLANs in bridge entities.

This memo defines those objects needed for the management of a bridging
entity operating in the transparent mode, as well as some objects
applicable to all types of bridges.  Managed objects for Source-Routing
are defined in [23].


2.1.  Scope

This MIB includes a comprehensive set of managed objects which attempts
to match the set defined in IEEE 802.1D and IEEE 802.1Q.  However, to be
consistent with the spirit of the SNMP Framework, a subjective judgement
was made to omit the objects from those standards most 'costly' to
implement in an agent and least 'essential' for fault and configuration
management.  The omissions are described in section 3 below.

Historical note:

RFC 1493 used the following principles for determining inclusion of an
object in the BRIDGE-MIB module:

 (1)   Start with a small set of essential objects and add only as
       further objects are needed.






Bell, et al.             Expires September 1999         [Page 4]


Internet Draft            Bridge MIB Extensions               March 1999


 (2)   Require objects be essential for either fault or configuration
       management.

 (3)   Consider evidence of current use and/or utility.

 (4)   Limit the total of objects.

 (5)   Exclude objects which are simply derivable from others in this or
       other MIBs.

 (6)   Avoid causing critical sections to be heavily instrumented.  The
       guideline that was followed is one counter per critical section
       per layer.



3.  Structure of MIBs

This document defines additional objects, on top of those existing in
the base BRIDGE-MIB module defined in RFC1493: that MIB module is
maintained unchanged for backwards compatibility.  Section 3.4.3 of the
present document contains some recommendations regarding usage of
objects in RFC1493 by devices implementing the enhancements defined
here.

Two MIB modules are defined here:

 (1)   Managed objects for an extended bridge MIB module P-BRIDGE-MIB
       for the traffic class and multicast filtering enhancements
       defined by IEEE 802.1D-1998.

 (2)   Managed objects for a virtual bridge MIB module Q-BRIDGE-MIB for
       the Virtual LAN bridging enhancements defined by IEEE
       802.1Q-1998.


3.1.  Structure of Extended Bridge MIB module

Objects in this MIB are arranged into groups.  Each group is organized
as a set of related objects.  The overall structure and assignment of
objects to their groups is shown below.

3.1.1.  Relationship to IEEE 802.1D-1998 Manageable Objects

This section contains a cross-reference to the objects defined in IEEE
802.1D-1998 [19].  It also details those objects that are not considered
necessary in this MIB module.

Some objects defined by [19] have been included in the virtual bridge
MIB module rather than this one: entries in dot1qTpGroupTable,
dot1qForwardAllTable and dot1qForwardUnregisteredTable are required for
virtual bridged LANs with additional indexing (e.g. per-VLAN, per-FDB)
and so are not defined here.  Instead, devices which do not implement
virtual bridged LANs, should implement these tables with a fixed value
for dot1qFdbId (the value 1 is recommended) or dot1qVlanIndex (the value
1 is recommended).  Devices which support Extended Filtering Services
(dynamic learning of Multicast Group Addresses and Group Service
Requirements in the Filtering Database) should support
dot1qTpGroupTable, dot1qForwardAllTable and
dot1qForwardUnregisteredTable.

                                    control is provided in this MIB.


3.1.2.  Relationship to IEEE 802.1Q Manageable Objects

This section contains a cross-reference to the objects defined in IEEE
802.1Q-1998 [20].  These objects have been included in this MIB as they
provide a natural fit with the 802.1D objects they are located with.

3.1.3.  The dot1dExtBase Group

This group contains the objects which are applicable to all bridges
implementing the traffic class and multicast filtering features of
802.1D.  It includes per-device configuration of GARP and GMRP
protocols.  This group will be implemented by all devices which
implement the extensions defined in 802.1D-1998.


3.1.4.  The dot1dPriority Group

This group contains the objects for configuring and reporting status of
priority-based queuing mechanisms in a bridge.  This includes per- port
user_priority treatment, mapping of user_priority in frames into
internal traffic classes and outbound user_priority and access_priority.


3.1.5.  The dot1dGarp Group

This group contains the objects for configuring and reporting on
operation of the Generic Attribute Registration Protocol (GARP).


3.1.6.  The dot1dGmrp Group

This group contains the objects for configuring and reporting on
operation of the GARP Multicast Registration Protocol (GMRP).


3.1.7.  The dot1dHCPortTable

This table extends the dot1dTp group from RFC1493 and contains the
objects for reporting port bridging statistics for high-capacity network
interfaces.

3.2.  Structure of Virtual Bridge MIB module

Objects in this MIB are arranged into groups.  Each group is organized
as a set of related objects.  The overall structure and assignment of
objects to their groups is shown below.  Some of the original objects
from RFC1493 need to be indexed differently when extended in a VLAN
environment so some objects in that module effectively duplicate new
objects defined here: this is necessary for backwards compatibility.


3.2.1.  Relationship to IEEE 802.1Q Manageable Objects

This section contains a cross-reference to the objects defined in [20].
It also details those objects that are not considered necessary in this
MIB module.

Note: unlike IEEE 802.1D, [20] chose not to define a new set of managed
object names so those following are referenced from the descriptions of
management operations with section numbering from clause 12 in that
document.

3.2.2.  The dot1qBase Group

This mandatory group contains the objects which are applicable to all
bridges implementing 802.1Q virtual LANs.


3.2.3.  The dot1qTp Group

This group contains objects that control the operation and report the
status of transparent bridging.  This includes management of the dynamic
Filtering Databases for both unicast and multicast forwarding.  This
group will be implemented by all bridges that perform destination-
address filtering.

3.2.4.  The dot1qStatic Group

This group contains objects that control static configuration
information for transparent bridging.  This includes management of the
static entries in the Filtering Databases for both unicast and multicast
forwarding.


3.2.5.  The dot1qVlan Group

This group contains objects that control configuration and report status
of the Virtual LANs known to a bridge.  This includes management of the
statically configured VLANs as well as reporting VLANs discovered by
other means e.g. GVRP.  It also controls configuration and reports
status of per-port objects relating to VLANs and reports traffic
statistics.  It also provides for management of the VLAN Learning
Constraints.



3.3.  Textual Conventions

The datatypes MacAddress, BridgeId, Timeout, EnabledStatus, PortList,
VlanIndex and VlanId are used as textual conventions in this document.
These textual conventions have NO effect on either the syntax nor the
semantics of any managed object.  Objects defined using these
conventions are always encoded by means of the rules that define their
primitive type.  Hence, no changes to the SMI or the SNMP are necessary
to accommodate these textual conventions which are adopted merely for
the convenience of readers.



3.4.  Relationship to Other MIBs

As described above, some IEEE 802.1D management objects have not been
included in this MIB because they overlap with objects in other MIBs
applicable to a bridge implementing this MIB.  In particular, it is
assumed that a bridge implementing this MIB will also implement (at
least) the 'system' group defined in MIB-II [24], the 'interfaces' group
defined in [22] and the old Bridge MIB [21].









Bell, et al.             Expires September 1999        [Page 13]


Internet Draft            Bridge MIB Extensions               March 1999


3.4.1.  Relationship to the 'system' group

In MIB-II, the 'system' group is defined as being mandatory for all
systems such that each managed entity contains one instance of each
object in the 'system' group.  Thus, those objects apply to the entity
as a whole irrespective of whether the entity's sole functionality is
bridging, or whether bridging is only a subset of the entity's
functionality.


3.4.2.  Relation to Interfaces MIB

RFC 1573, the Interface MIB Evolution [22], requires that any MIB which
is an adjunct of the Interface MIB, clarify specific areas within the
Interface MIB.  These areas were intentionally left vague in [22] to
avoid over constraining the MIB, thereby precluding management of
certain media-types.

Section 3.3 of [22] enumerates several areas which a media-specific MIB
must clarify.  Each of these areas is addressed in a following
subsection.  The implementor is referred to [22] in order to understand
the general intent of these areas.

In [22], the 'interfaces' group is defined as being mandatory for all
systems and contains information on an entity's interfaces, where each
interface is thought of as being attached to a `subnetwork'.  (Note that
this term is not to be confused with `subnet' which refers to an
addressing partitioning scheme used in the Internet suite of protocols.)
The term 'segment' is used in this memo to refer to such a subnetwork,
whether it be an Ethernet segment, a 'ring', a WAN link, or even an X.25
virtual circuit.

Implicit in this Bridge MIB is the notion of ports on a bridge.  Each of
these ports is associated with one interface of the 'interfaces' group
(one row in ifTable) and, in most situations, each port is associated
with a different interface.  However, there are situations in which
multiple ports are associated with the same interface.  An example of
such a situation would be several ports each corresponding one-to-one
with several X.25 virtual circuits but all on the same interface.

Each port is uniquely identified by a port number.  A port number has no
mandatory relationship to an interface number, but in the simple case a
port number will have the same value as the corresponding interface's
interface number.  Port numbers are in the range (1..dot1dBaseNumPorts).






Bell, et al.             Expires September 1999        [Page 14]


Internet Draft            Bridge MIB Extensions               March 1999


Some entities perform other functionality as well as bridging through
the sending and receiving of data on their interfaces.  In such
situations, only a subset of the data sent/received on an interface is
within the domain of the entity's bridging functionality.  This subset
is considered to be delineated according to a set of protocols, with
some protocols being bridged, and other protocols not being bridged.
For example, in an entity which exclusively performed bridging, all
protocols would be considered as being bridged, whereas in an entity
which performed IP routing on IP datagrams and only bridged other
protocols, only the non-IP data would be considered as being bridged.
Thus, this Bridge MIB (and in particular, its counters) is applicable
only to that subset of the data on an entity's interfaces which is
sent/received for a protocol being bridged.  All such data is
sent/received via the ports of the bridge.


3.4.2.1.  Layering Model

This memo assumes the interpretation of the Interfaces Group to be in
accordance with [22] which states that the interfaces table (ifTable)
contains information on the managed resource's interfaces and that each
sub-layer below the internetwork layer of a network interface is
considered an interface.

This memo recommends that, within an entity, VLANs which are
instantiated as an entry in dot1qVlanCurrentTable by either management
configuration through dot1qVlanStaticTable or by dynamic means (e.g.
through GVRP), are NOT also represented by an entry in ifTable.

Where an entity contains higher-layer protocol entities e.g. IP-layer
interfaces, that transmit and receive traffic to/from a VLAN, these
should be represented in the ifTable as interfaces of type
propVirtual(53).


3.4.2.2.  ifStackTable

In addition, [22] defines a table 'ifStackTable' for describing the
relationship between logical interfaces within an entity.  It is
anticipated that implementors will use this table to describe the
binding of e.g. IP interfaces to physical ports, although the presence
of VLANs makes the representation less than perfect for showing
connectivity: the ifStackTable cannot represent the full capability of
the 802.1Q VLAN bridging standard since that makes a distinction between
VLAN bindings on 'ingress' to and 'egress' from a port: these





Bell, et al.             Expires September 1999        [Page 15]


Internet Draft            Bridge MIB Extensions               March 1999


relationships may or may not be symmetrical whereas [22] assumes a
symmetrical binding for transmit and receive.  This makes it necessary
to define other manageable objects for configuring which ports are
members of which VLANs.


3.4.2.3.  ifRcvAddressTable

This table contains all MAC addresses, unicast, multicast, and
broadcast, for which an interface will receive packets and forward them
up to a higher layer entity for local consumption.  Note that this does
not include addresses for data-link layer control protocols such as
Spanning-Tree, GMRP or GVRP.  The format of the address, contained in
ifRcvAddressAddress, is the same as for ifPhysAddress.

This table does not include unicast or multicast addresses which are
accepted for possible forwarding out some other port.  This table is
explicitly not intended to provide a bridge address filtering mechanism.


3.4.3.  Relation to Basic Bridge MIB

This section defines how objects in the basic bridge MIB module should
be represented for devices which implement the extensions: some of the
old objects are less useful in such devices but must still be
implemented for reasons of backwards comaptibility.  Note that formal
conformance statements for that MIB module do not exist since it is
defined in SMIv1.


3.4.3.1.  The dot1dBase Group

This mandatory group contains the objects which are applicable to all
types of bridges.  Interpretation of this group is unchanged.


3.4.3.2.  The dot1dStp Group

This group contains the objects that denote the bridge's state with
respect to the Spanning Tree Protocol.  Interpretation of this group is
unchanged.

Internet Draft            Bridge MIB Extensions               March 1999


3.4.3.3.  The dot1dTp Group

This group contains objects that describe the entity's state with
respect to transparent bridging.

In a device operating with a single Filtering Database, interpretation
of this group is unchanged.

In a device supporting multiple Filtering Databases, this group is
interpreted as follows:

dot1dTpLearnedEntryDiscards
     The number of times that *any* of the FDBs became full.

dot1dTpAgingTime
     This applies to all Filtering Databases.

dot1dTpFdbTable
     Report MAC addresses learned on each port, regardless of which
     Filtering Database they have been learnt in.  If an address has
     been learnt in multiple databases on a single port, report it only
     once.  If an address has been learnt in multiple databases on more
     than one port, report the entry on any one of the valid ports.

dot1dTpPortTable
     This table is port-based and is not affected by multiple Filtering
     Databases or multiple VLANs.  The counters should include frames
     received or transmitted for all VLANs.  Note that equivalent 64-bit
     port statistics counters are defined in this document for high-
     capacity network interfaces with conformance statements to indicate
     for which speeds of interface they are required.


3.4.3.4.  The dot1dStatic Group

This optional group contains objects that describe the configuration of
destination-address filtering.

In a device operating with a single Filtering Database, interpretation
of this group is unchanged.

In a device supporting multiple Filtering Databases, this group is
interpreted as follows:

Internet Draft            Bridge MIB Extensions               March 1999


dot1dStaticTable
     Entries read from this table include all static entries from all of
     the Filtering Databases.  Entries for the same MAC address and
     receive port in more than one Filtering Database must appear only
     once since these are the indices of this table.  This table should
     be implemented as read-only in devices that support multiple
     Forwarding Databases - instead, write access should be provided
     through dot1qStaticUnicastTable and dot1qStaticMulticastTable, as
     defined in this document.



4.  Extensions to RFC 1493

In addition to the objects in RFC1493, this document contains:

 (1)   References point to sections of IEEE 802.1D-1998.

 (2)   Added support for multiple traffic classes and dynamic multicast
       filtering as per IEEE 802.1D-1998.

 (3)   Added support for bridged Virtual LANs as per IEEE 802.1Q-1998.

 (4)   Added support for 64-bit versions of existing RFC1493 port
       counters.

9.  Security Considerations

There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that have a
MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects may be
considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The
support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET/SET
(read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features
as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of the User-
based Security Model RFC 2274 [12] and the View-based Access Control
Model RFC 2275 [15] is recommended.

It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity
giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly configured to give
access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have
legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
