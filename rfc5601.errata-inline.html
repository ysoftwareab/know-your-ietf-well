1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines a MIB module that can be used to manage
   pseudowire (PW) services for transmission over a Packet Switched
   Network (PSN) [RFC3931] [RFC4447].  This MIB module provides generic
   management of PWs that is common to all types of PSN and PW services
   defined by the IETF PWE3 Working Group.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB

   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [BCP14].

   This document adopts the definitions, acronyms, and mechanisms
   described in [RFC3985] and [RFC3916].  Unless otherwise stated, the
   mechanisms of [RFC3985] apply and will not be re-described here.

4.  Overview

   The PWE3 MIB modules architecture provides a layered modular model
   into which any supported emulated service can be connected to any
   supported PSN type.  This specific MIB module provides the glue for
   mapping between the emulated service onto the native PSN service.  As
   such, the defining of a PW emulated service requires the use of at
   least three types of MIB modules.

   Starting from the emulated service, the first type is a service-
   specific module, which is dependent on the emulated signal type.
   These modules are defined in other documents.

   The second type is this module, the PW-STD-MIB module, which
   configures general parameters of the PW that are common to all types
   of emulated services and PSN types.

   The third type of module is a PSN-specific module.  There is a
   different module for each type of PSN.  These modules associate the
   PW with one or more &quot;tunnels&quot; that carry the service over the PSN.
   These modules are defined in other documents.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   The MIB module consists of six tables:

   - The generic configuration and status monitoring objects that are
     common to all service types and PSN types (pwTable).

   - The PW Performance Current Table (pwPerfCurrentTable) contains PW
     statistics for the current 15-minute period.

   - The PW Performance Interval Table (pwPerfIntervalTable) contains PW
     statistics for historical intervals (usually 96 15-minute entries
     to cover a 24-hour period).

   - The PW Performance 1-day Interval Table (pwPerf1DayIntervalTable)
     contains PW statistics for historical intervals accumulated per
     day.  Usually 30 1-day entries to cover a monthly period.

   - The mapping table (pwIndexMappingTable) enables the reverse mapping
     of the unique PWid parameters [peer IP, PW type, and PW ID] and the
     pwIndex.

   - The mapping table (pwGenFecIndexMappingTable) enables the reverse
     mapping of unique PWid parameters used in genFecSignaling
     [pwGroupAttachmentID, pwLocalAttachmentID, and pwPeerAttachmentID]
     and the pwIndex.

   This MIB module uses Textual Conventions from [RFC2578], [RFC2579],
   [RFC2580], [RFC2863], [RFC3411], [RFC3593], [RFC3705], [RFC4001], and
   [RFC5542], and references [RFC3413], [RFC4623], and [RFC4720].

6.  PW-STD-MIB Module Usage

   An entry in the PW table (pwTable) MUST exist for all PW types (ATM,
   FR, Ethernet, SONET, etc.).  This table holds generic parameters
   related to the PW creation and monitoring.

   A conceptual row can be created in the pwTable in one of the
   following ways:

   1) The operator creates a row in the pwTable when configuring the
      node for a new service.  This mode MUST be supported by the agent,
      and MUST be used when creating a non-signaled (manually assigned)
      PW.

   2) The agent MAY create a row in the pwTable if a signaling message
      has been received from a peer node with signaling identification
      parameters that are not already known to the local node (i.e.,
      there is no related entry created by the operator with matching
      parameters).  This mode is OPTIONAL.

   3) The agent MAY create a row in the pwTable automatically due to
      some auto-discovery application, or based on configuration that is
      done through non-SNMP applications.  This mode is OPTIONAL.

      - The agent then creates the rows in the (locally supported)
        performance tables and reverse-mapping tables in PW-STD-MIB
        module.

7.  Relations to Other PWE3 MIB Modules

   - Based on the PSN type defined for the PW, a row is created in the
     PSN-specific module (for example, [RFC5602]) and associated to the
     PW table by the common pwIndex.

   - Based on the PW type defined for the PW, a row is created in the
     service-specific module (for example, [CEPMIB]) and associated to
     the PW table by the common pwIndex.

   - Unless all the necessary entries in the applicable tables have been
     created and all the parameters have been consistently configured in
     those tables, signaling cannot be performed from the local node,
     and the pwVcOperStatus should report &#x27;notPresent&#x27;.

8.  Relations to the IF-MIB

   The PW in general is not an ifIndex [RFC2863] on its own, for agent
   scalability reasons.  The PW is typically associated via the PWE3 MIB
   modules to an ifIndex the PW is emulating.  This ifIndex may
   represent a physical entity -- for example, a PW emulating a SONET
   path as in Circuit Emulation Service over Packet (CEP).  In that
   case, the PW itself is not an ifIndex; however, the PW-STD-CEP-MIB
   module associates the PW to the ifIndex of the path to be emulated.
   In some cases, the PW will be associated to an ifIndex representing a
   virtual interface.  An example is Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)
   where the PW emulates a logical interface of a (logical) bridge.  The
   physical ports&#x27; association to the VPLS instance is defined in the
   non-PW MIB modules in this case.

   Exception to the above MAY exist in some implementations where it is
   convenient to manage the PW as an ifIndex in the ifTable.  A special
   ifType to represent a PW virtual interface (246) will be used in the
   ifTable in this case.

   When the PW is managed as an ifIndex, by default it SHOULD NOT be
   stacked, i.e., this ifIndex SHOULD NOT be layered above the
   respective PSN tunnel ifIndex or the attachment circuit ifIndex or
   the interface carrying the attachment circuit.

   Note that the ifIndex that carries the PW toward/from the PSN is not
   explicitly configured via PWE3 MIB modules except in rare cases.  In
   most cases, the PW is carried inside a PSN tunnel, and the interfaces
   carrying the tunnel are specified in the related MIB modules that
   control the PSN tunnels.

9.  PW Notifications

   This MIB module includes notifications for PW entering the up or down
   state, in accordance with the guidelines for interface notifications
   as described in [RFC2863].  Implementers should be aware that in many
   systems, it is desired to correlate notifications, such that
   notifications will not be emitted if notifications from a higher
   level (such as ports or tunnels) are already in effect.  Specifically
   for PWs, it is anticipated that most network&#x27;s equipment failures
   turn into lowerLayerDown state at the PW level, where a notification
   has already been emitted from a higher level.

   When a PW is represented as an ifIndex, it is RECOMMENDED that PW
   notifications be turned off, to avoid duplication with the ifIndex
   status change notifications.

10.  Example of the PW MIB Modules Usage

   In this section, we provide an example of using the MIB objects
   described in section 7 to set up a CEP PW over Multiprotocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) PSN.  While this example is not meant to illustrate
   every permutation of the MIB, it is intended as an aid to
   understanding some of the key concepts.  It is meant to be read after
   going through the MIB itself.

   In this example, a PW service for CEP is configured over an MPLS PSN
   (MPLS-TE tunnel).  It uses LDP as in [RFC4447] for service setup.

   For the operation in the service-specific MIB modules and the PSN-
   specific MIB modules, see the specific MIB module memo.  This example
   is continued in the memo describing the PW-CEP-STD-MIB module (for
   example, [CEPMIB]) and the PW-MPLS-STD-MIB module [RFC5602].

   In the PW-STD-MIB module:

   In pwTable:
   {
      pwIndex               5,

      pwType                cep,

      pwInboundMode         loose,

      pwPeerAddrType        ipv4,
      pwPeerAddr            192.0.2.5, -- In this case, equal to the
                                       -- peer LDP entity IP addr
      pwID                  10,
      pwLocalGroupID        12,

                                    -- report to the peer.
      pwRemoteGroupID       0xFFFF, -- Will be received by
                                    -- signaling protocol
      pwRemoteCwStatus      notKnownYet,
      pwRemoteIfMtu         0,
      pwRemoteIfString      &quot;&quot;,
      pwRemoteCapabilities  notYetKnown,
      ..
      pwOutboundVcLabel     0xFFFF, -- Will be received by
                                    -- signaling protocol
      pwInboundVcLabel      0xFFFF, -- Will be set by signaling
                                    -- protocol
      pwName                &quot;Example of CEP PW&quot;,
      pwDescr               &quot;&quot;,
      ..

      pwAdminStatus         up,
      ..
       }

11.  IANA PWE3 MIB Module

   This section contains the initial version of the IANA-PWE3-MIB.  IANA
   has updated this MIB module based on expert review as defined in
   [RFC5226].  Each new assignment of PW type or PW PSN type made by
   IANA based on the procedures described in [RFC4446] should be
   documented in the online version of IANA-PWE3-MIB.  The current
   IANA-PWE3-MIB contains PW types as requested in [RFC4446] and
   [RFC4863].

     DESCRIPTION
        &quot;This MIB module contains managed object definitions for
         pseudowire operation as in Bryant, S. and P. Pate, &#x27;Pseudo
         Wire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) Architecture&#x27; [RFC3985],
         Martini, L., et al, &#x27;Pseudowire Setup and Maintenance Using
         the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)&#x27; [RFC4447], and
         Townsley, M., et al, &#x27;Layer Two Tunneling Protocol
         (Version 3)&#x27; [RFC3931].

         This MIB module enables the use of any underlying packet
         switched network (PSN).  MIB nodules that will support
         PW operations over specific PSN types are defined in
         separate memos.

         The indexes for this MIB module are also used to index the
         PSN-specific tables and the PW-specific tables.  The PW Type
         dictates which PW-specific MIB module to use.

     DESCRIPTION
          &quot;A row in this table represents a pseudowire (PW) virtual
           connection across a packet network.  It is indexed by
           pwIndex, which uniquely identifies a singular
           connection.
           A row can be created by an operator command from a
           management plan of a PE, by signaling, or due to auto-
           discovery process.  An operator&#x27;s command can be issued via
           a non-SNMP application; in such case, a row will be created
           implicitly by the agent.
           The read-create objects in this table are divided into
           three categories:
           1) Objects that MUST NOT be changed after row activation.
              These are objects that define basic properties of the
              PW (for example type, destination, etc.).
           2) Objects that MAY be changed when the PW is
              defined as not active.  A change of these objects involves
              re-signaling of the PW or it might be traffic affecting.
              PW not active is defined as one of the following
              conditions:
                  a) The pwRowStatus is notInService(2).
                  b) The pwRowStatus is notReady(3).
                  c) The pwAdminStatus is down(2).
           If the operator needs to change one of the values for an
           active row, the operator can either set the pwRowStatus to
           notInService(2) or set pwAdminStatus to down(2).
           Signaling (or traffic) is initiated again upon setting
           the pwRowStatus to active(1) or setting the pwAdminStatus
           to up(1) or testing(3), respectively.

           3) Objects that MAY be changed at any time.

           A PW MAY have an entry in the ifTable in addition to the
           entry in this table.  In this case, a special ifType for PW
           will be set in the ifTable, and the ifIndex in the ifTable
           of the PW will be set in the pwIfIndex object in this table.

           By default, all the read-create objects MUST NOT be
           changed after row activation, unless specifically indicated
           in the individual object description.

           Manual entries in this table SHOULD be preserved after a
           reboot; the agent MUST ensure the integrity of those
           entries.  If the set of entries of a specific row are found
           to be inconsistent after reboot, the PW pwOperStatus MUST
           be declared as notPresent(5).

          &quot;If the PW is attached to another PW instead of a local
           native service, this item indicates the pwIndex of the
           attached PW.  Otherwise, this object MUST
           be set to zero.  Attachment to another PW will have no
           PW specific entry in any of the service MIB modules.
           This object may be modified only when the value of
           the associated pwAdminStatus object is down(2), and
           the associated pwOperStatus object has value down(2)
           or notPresent(5) such that the row in the pwTable
           represents an inactive PW.&quot;

<b>Notes:</b><br/>
Description of the pwEntry object in the same RFC states that &quot;The read-create objects in this table are divided into<br/>           three categories:<br/>           1) Objects that MUST NOT be changed after row activation.<br/>              These are objects that define basic properties of the<br/>              PW (for example type, destination, etc.).<br/>           2) Objects that MAY be changed when the PW is<br/>              defined as not active.  A change of these objects involves<br/>              re-signaling of the PW or it might be traffic affecting.<br/>              PW not active is defined as one of the following<br/>              conditions:<br/>                  a) The pwRowStatus is notInService(2).<br/>                  b) The pwRowStatus is notReady(3).<br/>                  c) The pwAdminStatus is down(2).<br/>           If the operator needs to change one of the values for an<br/>           active row, the operator can either set the pwRowStatus to<br/>           notInService(2) or set pwAdminStatus to down(2).<br/>           Signaling (or traffic) is initiated again upon setting<br/>           the pwRowStatus to active(1) or setting the pwAdminStatus<br/>           to up(1) or testing(3), respectively.<br/>           3) Objects that MAY be changed at any time.&quot;<br/><br/>In further states (in tthe same description) that &quot;By default, all the read-create objects MUST NOT be changed after row activation, unless specifically indicated in the individual object description.&quot;<br/><br/>pwAttachedPwIndex object is used to stitch a couple of PWs represented by two different rows in the pwTable, with the pwAttachedPwIndex value in the row representing one of them set to the pwIndex of the other one and vice versa.<br/>Since there is no way in the SMIv2 paradigm to create two rows in the same table<br/>in a single atomic operation, setting a this attribute in a pair of rows is only <br/>possible when both are created. In order to do that, read-create access mode of<br/>the pwAttachedPwIndex object has to be interpreted as ability to set its value<br/>when the row represents an inactive PW. <br/>In accordance with the quoted description, such an interpretation must be<br/>explicitly specified in the description of this object.<br/><br/>Such a specification is missing in the current text, hence the default<br/>interpretation of the read-create access mode is holds.<br/>Proposed text fixes this problem.

          If the pwOwner object is &#x27;pwIdFecSignaling&#x27; or
          &#x27;l2tpControlProtocol&#x27;, then this object is signaled in the

          Element&#x27;.  For other values of pwOwner, this object is not
          signaled and it MAY be set to zero.

          For implementations that support the pwIndexMappingTable,
          a non-zero value is RECOMMENDED, even if this
          identifier is not signaled.  This is so that reverse
          mappings can be provided by pwIndexMappingTable and
          pwPeerMappingTable.  It is therefore RECOMMENDED that the
          value of this pwID be unique (or if pwPeerAddrType is not
          &#x27;unknown&#x27;, at least [pwType, pwID, pwPeerAddrType, pwPeerAddr]
          is unique.)&quot;

     STATUS  current
     DESCRIPTION
         &quot;This notification is generated when the pwOperStatus
          object for one or more contiguous entries in the pwTable are
          about to enter the down(2) or lowerLayerDown(6) state from
          any other state, except for transition from the
          notPresent(5) state.  For the purpose of deciding when
          these notifications occur, the lowerLayerDown(6) state
          and the down(2) state are considered to be equivalent;
          i.e., there is no notification on transition from
          lowerLayerDown(6) into down(2), and there is a trap on
          transition from any other state except down(2) (and
          notPresent) into lowerLayerDown(6).

          The included values of pwOperStatus MUST each be equal to
          down(2) or lowerLayerDown(6).  The two instances of
          pwOperStatus in this notification indicate the range of
          indexes that are affected.  Note that all the indexes of
          the two ends of the range can be derived from the
          instance identifiers of these two objects.  For cases
          where a contiguous range of cross-connects have
          transitioned into the down(2) and lowerLayerDown(6) states
          at roughly the same time, the device SHOULD issue a single
          notification for each range of contiguous indexes in an
          effort to minimize the emission of a large number of
          notifications.  If a notification has to be issued for
          just a single cross-connect entry, then the instance
          identifier (and values) of the two pwOperStatus objects
          MUST be identical.&quot;

     DESCRIPTION
         &quot;This notification is generated when the pwOperStatus
          object for one or more contiguous entries in the pwTable are
          about to enter the up(1) state from some other state

          except the notPresent(5) state and given that the pwDown
          notification been issued for these entries.  The included
          values of pwOperStatus MUST both be set equal to this
          new state (i.e., up(1)).  The two instances of pwOperStatus
          in this notification indicate the range of indexes that
          are affected.  Note that all the indexes of the two ends
          of the range can be derived from the instance identifiers
          of these two objects.  For cases where a contiguous range
          of cross-connects have transitioned into the up(1) state

13.  Security Considerations

   It is clear that this MIB module is potentially useful for monitoring
   PW-capable PEs.  This MIB module can also be used for configuration
   of certain objects, and anything that can be configured can be
   incorrectly configured, with potentially disastrous results.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  the pwTable contains objects to configure PW parameters on a
      Provider Edge (PE) device.  Unauthorized access to objects in this
      table could result in disruption of traffic on the network.  The
      objects pwUpDownNotifEnable and pwNotifRate control the reports
      from the network element to the EMS.  Unauthorized access to these
      objects could result in disruption of configuration and status
      change reporting, resulting mis-view of the network conditions.
      The use of stronger mechanisms such as SNMPv3 security should be
      considered where possible.  Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and USM MUST
      be used with any v3 agent that implements this MIB module.
      Administrators should consider whether read access to these
      objects should be allowed, since read access may be undesirable
      under certain circumstances.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  the pwTable, pwPerfCurrentTable, pwPerfIntervalTable,
      pwPerf1DayIntervalTable, pwIndexMappingTable, pwPeerMappingTable,
      and pwGenFecIndexMappingTable collectively show the pseudowire
      connectivity topology and its performance characteristics.  If an
      administrator does not want to reveal this information, then these
      tables should be considered sensitive/vulnerable.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

14.  IANA Considerations

14.1.  ifType for PW

   IANA has assigned a value (246) for PW in the IANAifType-MIB called
   ifPwType.

14.2.  PW MIB Modules OBJECT IDENTIFIER Values

   A PW may appear as ifIndex in the ifTable, and therefore the pwStdMIB
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER has been assigned under the &#x27;transmission&#x27; subtree,
   as the common practice in assigning OBJECT IDENTIFIERs for MIB
   modules representing entities in the ifTable.

   All other MIB modules related to PW management SHOULD be assigned
   under the &#x27;mib-2&#x27; subtree; individual requests will appear in the MIB
   module memo&#x27;s IANA Considerations section.

14.3.  IANA Considerations for PW-STD-MIB

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

         Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
         ----------        -----------------------

         pwStdMIB          { transmission 246 }

14.4.  IANA Considerations for IANA-PWE3-MIB

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

         Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
         ----------        -----------------------

         ianaPwe3MIB       { mib-2 174 }
