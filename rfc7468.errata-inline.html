          Textual Encodings of PKIX, PKCS, and CMS Structures

Abstract

   This document describes and discusses the textual encodings of the
   Public-Key Infrastructure X.509 (PKIX), Public-Key Cryptography
   Standards (PKCS), and Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS).  The
   textual encodings are well-known, are implemented by several
   applications and libraries, and are widely deployed.  This document
   articulates the de facto rules by which existing implementations
   operate and defines them so that future implementations can
   interoperate.

1.  Introduction

   Several security-related standards used on the Internet define ASN.1
   data formats that are normally encoded using the Basic Encoding Rules
   (BER) or Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) [X.690], which are
   binary, octet-oriented encodings.  This document is about the textual
   encodings of the following formats:

   1.  Certificates, Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs), and Subject
       Public Key Info structures in the Internet X.509 Public Key
       Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
       Profile [RFC5280].

   2.  PKCS #10: Certification Request Syntax [RFC2986].

   3.  PKCS #7: Cryptographic Message Syntax [RFC2315].

   4.  Cryptographic Message Syntax [RFC5652].

   5.  PKCS #8: Private-Key Information Syntax [RFC5208], renamed to One
       Asymmetric Key in Asymmetric Key Package [RFC5958], and Encrypted
       Private-Key Information Syntax in the same documents.

   6.  Attribute Certificates in An Internet Attribute Certificate
       Profile for Authorization [RFC5755].

   A disadvantage of a binary data format is that it cannot be
   interchanged in textual transports, such as email or text documents.
   One advantage with text-based encodings is that they are easy to
   modify using common text editors; for example, a user may concatenate
   several certificates to form a certificate chain with copy-and-paste
   operations.

   The tradition within the RFC series can be traced back to Privacy-
   Enhanced Mail (PEM) [RFC1421], based on a proposal by Marshall Rose
   in Message Encapsulation [RFC934].  Originally called &quot;PEM
   encapsulation mechanism&quot;, &quot;encapsulated PEM message&quot;, or (arguably)
   &quot;PEM printable encoding&quot;, today the format is sometimes referred to
   as &quot;PEM encoding&quot;.  Variations include OpenPGP ASCII armor [RFC4880]
   and OpenSSH key file format [RFC4716].

   For reasons that basically boil down to non-coordination or
   inattention, many PKIX, PKCS, and CMS libraries implement a text-
   based encoding that is similar to -- but not identical with -- PEM
   encoding.  This document specifies the _textual encoding_ format,
   articulates the de facto rules that most implementations operate by,
   and provides recommendations that will promote interoperability going
   forward.  This document also provides common nomenclature for syntax
   elements, reflecting the evolution of this de facto standard format.
   Peter Gutmann&#x27;s &quot;X.509 Style Guide&quot; [X.509SG] contains a section
   &quot;base64 Encoding&quot; that describes the formats and contains suggestions
   similar to what is in this document.  All figures are real,
   functional examples, with key lengths and inner contents chosen to be
   as small as practicable.

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and
   &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

2.  General Considerations

   Textual encoding begins with a line comprising &quot;-----BEGIN &quot;, a
   label, and &quot;-----&quot;, and ends with a line comprising &quot;-----END &quot;, a
   label, and &quot;-----&quot;.  Between these lines, or &quot;encapsulation
   boundaries&quot;, are base64-encoded data according to Section 4 of
   [RFC4648].  (PEM [RFC1421] referred to this data as the &quot;encapsulated

   text portion&quot;.)  Data before the encapsulation boundaries are
   permitted, and parsers MUST NOT malfunction when processing such
   data.  Furthermore, parsers SHOULD ignore whitespace and other non-
   base64 characters and MUST handle different newline conventions.

   The type of data encoded is labeled depending on the type label in
   the &quot;-----BEGIN &quot; line (pre-encapsulation boundary).  For example,
   the line may be &quot;-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----&quot; to indicate that the
   content is a PKIX certificate (see further below).  Generators MUST
   put the same label on the &quot;-----END &quot; line (post-encapsulation
   boundary) as the corresponding &quot;-----BEGIN &quot; line.  Labels are
   formally case-sensitive, uppercase, and comprised of zero or more
   characters; they do not contain consecutive spaces or hyphen-minuses,
   nor do they contain spaces or hyphen-minuses at either end.  Parsers
   MAY disregard the label in the post-encapsulation boundary instead of
   signaling an error if there is a label mismatch: some extant
   implementations require the labels to match; others do not.

   There is exactly one space character (SP) separating the &quot;BEGIN&quot; or
   &quot;END&quot; from the label.  There are exactly five hyphen-minus (also
   known as dash) characters (&quot;-&quot;) on both ends of the encapsulation
   boundaries, no more, no less.

   The label type implies that the encoded data follows the specified
   syntax.  Parsers MUST handle non-conforming data gracefully.
   However, not all parsers or generators prior to this document behave
   consistently.  A conforming parser MAY interpret the contents as
   another label type but ought to be aware of the security implications
   discussed in the Security Considerations section.  The labels
   described in this document identify container formats that are not
   specific to any particular cryptographic algorithm, a property
   consistent with algorithm agility.  These formats use the ASN.1
   AlgorithmIdentifier structure as described in Section 4.1.1.2 of
   [RFC5280].

   Unlike legacy PEM encoding [RFC1421], OpenPGP ASCII armor, and the
   OpenSSH key file format, textual encoding does *not* define or permit
   headers to be encoded alongside the data.  Empty space can appear
   between the pre-encapsulation boundary and the base64, but generators
   SHOULD NOT emit such any such spacing.  (The provision for this empty
   area is a throwback to PEM, which defined an &quot;encapsulated header
   portion&quot;.)

   Implementers need to be aware that extant parsers diverge
   considerably on the handling of whitespace.  In this document,
   &quot;whitespace&quot; means any character or series of characters that
   represent horizontal or vertical space in typography.  In US-ASCII,
   whitespace means HT (0x09), VT (0x0B), FF (0x0C), SP (0x20), CR

   (0x0D), and LF (0x0A); &quot;blank&quot; means HT and SP; lines are divided
   with CRLF, CR, or LF.  The common ABNF production WSP is congruent
   with &quot;blank&quot;; a new production W is used for &quot;whitespace&quot;.  The ABNF
   in Section 3 is specific to US-ASCII.  As these textual encodings can
   be used on many different systems as well as on long-term archival
   storage media such as paper or engravings, an implementer ought to
   use the spirit rather than the letter of the rules when generating or
   parsing these formats in environments that are not strictly limited
   to US-ASCII.

   Most extant parsers ignore blanks at the ends of lines; blanks at the
   beginnings of lines or in the middle of the base64-encoded data are
   far less compatible.  These observations are codified in Figure 1.
   The most lax parser implementations are not line-oriented at all and
   will accept any mixture of whitespace outside of the encapsulation
   boundaries (see Figure 2).  Such lax parsing may run the risk of
   accepting text that was not intended to be accepted in the first
   place (e.g., because the text was a snippet or sample).

   Generators MUST wrap the base64-encoded lines so that each line
   consists of exactly 64 characters except for the final line, which
   will encode the remainder of the data (within the 64-character line
   boundary), and they MUST NOT emit extraneous whitespace.  Parsers MAY
   handle other line sizes.  These requirements are consistent with PEM
   [RFC1421].

   Files MAY contain multiple textual encoding instances.  This is used,
   for example, when a file contains several certificates.  Whether the
   instances are ordered or unordered depends on the context.

3.  ABNF

   The ABNF [RFC5234] of the textual encoding is:

  textualmsg = preeb *WSP eol
               *eolWSP
               base64text

5.1.  Encoding

   Public-key certificates are encoded using the &quot;CERTIFICATE&quot; label.
   The encoded data MUST be a BER (DER strongly preferred; see
   Appendix B) encoded ASN.1 Certificate structure as described in
   Section 4 of [RFC5280].

                       Figure 6: Certificate Example

   Historically, the label &quot;X509 CERTIFICATE&quot; and also less commonly
   &quot;X.509 CERTIFICATE&quot; have been used.  Generators conforming to this
   document MUST generate &quot;CERTIFICATE&quot; labels and MUST NOT generate
   &quot;X509 CERTIFICATE&quot; or &quot;X.509 CERTIFICATE&quot; labels.  Parsers SHOULD NOT
   treat &quot;X509 CERTIFICATE&quot; or &quot;X.509 CERTIFICATE&quot; as equivalent to
   &quot;CERTIFICATE&quot;, but a valid exception may be for backwards
   compatibility (potentially together with a warning).

5.2.  Explanatory Text

   Many tools are known to emit explanatory text before the BEGIN and
   after the END lines for PKIX certificates, more than any other type.
   If emitted, such text SHOULD be related to the certificate, such as
   providing a textual representation of key data elements in the
   certificate.

5.3.  File Extension

   Although textual encodings of PKIX structures can occur anywhere,
   many tools are known to offer an option to output this encoding when
   serializing PKIX structures.  To promote interoperability and to
   separate DER encodings from textual encodings, the extension &quot;.crt&quot;
   SHOULD be used for the textual encoding of a certificate.
   Implementations should be aware that in spite of this recommendation,
   many tools still default to encode certificates in this textual
   encoding with the extension &quot;.cer&quot;.

   This section does not disturb the official application/pkix-cert
   registration [RFC2585] in any way (which states that &quot;each &#x27;.cer&#x27;
   file contains exactly one certificate, encoded in DER format&quot;), but
   merely articulates a widespread, de facto alternative.

6.  Textual Encoding of Certificate Revocation Lists

   Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) are encoded using the &quot;X509 CRL&quot;
   label.  The encoded data MUST be a BER (DER strongly preferred; see
   Appendix B) encoded ASN.1 CertificateList structure as described in
   Section 5 of [RFC5280].

-----END X509 CRL-----

                           Figure 8: CRL Example

   Historically, the label &quot;CRL&quot; has rarely been used.  Today, it is not
   common and many popular tools do not understand the label.
   Therefore, this document standardizes &quot;X509 CRL&quot; in order to promote
   interoperability and backwards-compatibility.  Generators conforming
   to this document MUST generate &quot;X509 CRL&quot; labels and MUST NOT
   generate &quot;CRL&quot; labels.  Parsers SHOULD NOT treat &quot;CRL&quot; as equivalent
   to &quot;X509 CRL&quot;.

7.  Textual Encoding of PKCS #10 Certification Request Syntax

   PKCS #10 Certification Requests are encoded using the
   &quot;CERTIFICATE REQUEST&quot; label.  The encoded data MUST be a BER (DER
   strongly preferred; see Appendix B) encoded ASN.1
   CertificationRequest structure as described in [RFC2986].

   The label &quot;NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST&quot; is also in wide use.  Generators
   conforming to this document MUST generate &quot;CERTIFICATE REQUEST&quot;
   labels.  Parsers MAY treat &quot;NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST&quot; as equivalent to
   &quot;CERTIFICATE REQUEST&quot;.

8.  Textual Encoding of PKCS #7 Cryptographic Message Syntax

   PKCS #7 Cryptographic Message Syntax structures are encoded using the
   &quot;PKCS7&quot; label.  The encoded data MUST be a BER-encoded ASN.1
   ContentInfo structure as described in [RFC2315].

-----BEGIN PKCS7-----

-----END PKCS7-----

                        Figure 10: PKCS #7 Example

   The label &quot;CERTIFICATE CHAIN&quot; has been in use to denote a degenerate
   PKCS #7 structure that contains only a list of certificates (see
   Section 9 of [RFC2315]).  Several modern tools do not support this
   label.  Generators MUST NOT generate the &quot;CERTIFICATE CHAIN&quot; label.
   Parsers SHOULD NOT treat &quot;CERTIFICATE CHAIN&quot; as equivalent to
   &quot;PKCS7&quot;.

   PKCS #7 is an old specification that has long been superseded by CMS
   [RFC5652].  Implementations SHOULD NOT generate PKCS #7 when CMS is
   an alternative.

9.  Textual Encoding of Cryptographic Message Syntax

   Cryptographic Message Syntax structures are encoded using the &quot;CMS&quot;
   label.  The encoded data MUST be a BER-encoded ASN.1 ContentInfo
   structure as described in [RFC5652].

-----BEGIN CMS-----

-----END CMS-----

                          Figure 11: CMS Example

   CMS is the IETF successor to PKCS #7.  Section 1.1.1 of [RFC5652]
   describes the changes since PKCS #7 v1.5.  Implementations SHOULD
   generate CMS when it is an alternative, promoting interoperability
   and forwards-compatibility.

10.  One Asymmetric Key and the Textual Encoding of PKCS #8 Private Key
     Info

   Unencrypted PKCS #8 Private Key Information Syntax structures
   (PrivateKeyInfo), renamed to Asymmetric Key Packages
   (OneAsymmetricKey), are encoded using the &quot;PRIVATE KEY&quot; label.  The
   encoded data MUST be a BER (DER preferred; see Appendix B) encoded
   ASN.1 PrivateKeyInfo structure as described in PKCS #8 [RFC5208], or
   a OneAsymmetricKey structure as described in [RFC5958].  The two are
   semantically identical and can be distinguished by version number.

14.  Security Considerations

   Data in this format often originates from untrusted sources, thus
   parsers must be prepared to handle unexpected data without causing
   security vulnerabilities.

   Implementers building implementations that rely on canonical
   representation or the ability to fingerprint a particular data object
   need to understand that this document does not define canonical
   encodings.  The first ambiguity is introduced by permitting the text-
   encoded representation instead of the binary BER or DER encodings,
   but further ambiguities arise when multiple labels are treated as
   similar.  Variations of whitespace and non-base64 alphabetic
   characters can create further ambiguities.  Data encoding ambiguities
   also create opportunities for side channels.  If canonical encodings
   are desired, the encoded structure must be decoded and processed into
   a canonical form (namely, DER encoding).

Appendix B.  DER Expectations

   This appendix is informative.  Consult the respective standards for
   the normative rules.

   DER is a restricted profile of BER [X.690]; thus, all DER encodings
   of data values are BER encodings, but just one of the BER encodings
   is the DER encoding for a data value.  Canonical encoding matters
   when performing cryptographic operations; additionally, canonical
   encoding has certain efficiency advantages for parsers.  There are
   three principal reasons to encode with DER:

   1.  A digital signature is (supposed to be) computed over the DER
       encoding of the semantic content, so providing anything other
       than the DER encoding is senseless.  (In practice, an implementer
       might choose to have an implementation parse and digest the data
       as is, but this practice amounts to guesswork.)

   2.  In practice, cryptographic hashes are computed over the DER
       encoding for identification.

   3.  In practice, the content is small.  DER always encodes data
       values in definite-length form (where the length is stated at the
       beginning of the encoding); thus, a parser can anticipate memory
       or resource usage up front.

   Figure 20 matches the structures in this document with the particular
   reasons for DER encoding:

                     Figure 20: Guide for DER Encoding

   * Cryptographic Message Syntax is designed for content of any length;
     indefinite-length encoding enables one-pass processing (streaming)
     when generating the encoding.  Only certain parts -- namely, signed
     and authenticated attributes -- need to be DER encoded.

   ~ Although not always &quot;small&quot;, these encoded structures should not be
     particularly &quot;large&quot; (e.g., more than 16 kilobytes).  The parser
     ought to be informed of large things up front in any event; this is
     yet another reason to DER encode these things in the first place.

Acknowledgements

   Peter Gutmann suggested to document labels for Attribute Certificates
   and PKCS #7 messages, and to add examples for the non-standard
   variants.  Dr. Stephen Henson suggested distinguishing when BER
   versus DER is appropriate or necessary.
