                 draft-iesg-nomcom-eligibility-2020-03

Abstract

   The 2020-2021 Nominating Committee (NomCom) is to be formed between
   IETF 107 and IETF 108, and the issue of eligibility of who can serve
   on that NomCom needs clarification.  This document provides a one-
   time interpretation of the eligibility rules that is required for the
   exceptional situation of the cancellation of the in-person IETF 107
   meeting.  This document only affects the seating of the 2020-2021
   NomCom and any rules or processes that relate to NomCom eligibility
   before IETF 108, and does not set a precedent for the future.

1.  Introduction

   The COVID-19 outbreak, which at the time of this writing has been
   declared a global pandemic [PANDEMIC], has resulted in the
   cancellation of the in-person IETF 107 meeting [CANCEL107], resulting
   in its conversion to a limited-agenda virtual meeting, with remote
   participation only [VIRTUAL107].

   The 2020-2021 Nominating Committee (NomCom) is to be formed between
   IETF 107 and IETF 108, and the issue of eligibility of who can serve
   on that NomCom needs clarification: a one-time interpretation of the
   eligibility rules is required for this particular exceptional
   situation.  That interpretation will apply to the seating of that
   NomCom and to any rules or processes that relate to NomCom
   eligibility before the scheduled time for IETF 108.

   [[CREF1: RFC Editor: Please remove this paragraph.]] This document
   will be part of BCP 10 when it is published.

2.  Background

   Section 4.14 of BCP 10 [RFC8713] includes these requirements for
   eligibility:

      Members of the IETF community must have attended at least three of
      the last five IETF meetings in order to volunteer.

      The five meetings are the five most recent meetings that ended
      prior to the date on which the solicitation for NomCom volunteers
      was submitted for distribution to the IETF community.

   On 13 March a message was posted to the IETF discussion list
   [SOLICITINPUT], suggesting two possible interpretations and asking
   for community input that might include suggesting other
   interpretations.  Discussion over the subsequent two weeks centered
   around three:

   1.  Do not count IETF 107 at all, for the purpose of NomCom
       eligibility, as BCP 10 clearly refers to in-person meetings only.
       NomCom eligibility would, therefore, be based on attendance at
       IETFs 102 through 106.

   2.  Do not have anyone lose eligibility because of IETF 107, but do
       count someone as having attended 107, for the purpose of NomCom

       eligibility, if that person attended the IETF 107 virtual meeting
       (signed the electronic blue sheet).  People could thus gain
       eligibility from IETF 107, but could not lose eligibility from
       it, and eligibility would be based on attendance at IETFs 102
       through 107.

   3.  Count virtual attendance at IETF 107 and consider IETF 107 as one
       of the last five meetings, so that NomCom eligibility would be
       based on attendance at IETFs 103 through 107.

   In judging rough consensus the IESG has considered the arguments and
   levels of support in favor of and against each option.  The arguments
   largely involved issues of fairness to newer participants, acceptance
   of more participants in the volunteer pool, and greatest adherence to
   the spirit of the rules defined in BCP 10, which is the community-
   consensus basis we are working from.

   On 25 March a message was posted to the IETF discussion list
   [COMMENTDEADLINE], asking for final comments by 30 April.  This
   documents the outcome of that discussion with the choice of
   interpretation 1, above.

3.  Eligibility for the 2020-2021 Nominating Committee

   The following text modifies, for the 2020-2021 NomCom cycle only, the
   first two paragraphs (quoted above) of Section 4.14 of BCP 10
   [RFC8713]:

      Members of the IETF community must have attended at least three of
      the last five in-person IETF meetings in order to volunteer.

      The five meetings are the five most recent in-person meetings that
      ended prior to the date on which the solicitation for NomCom
      volunteers was submitted for distribution to the IETF community.
      Because no IETF 107 in-person meeting was held, for the 2020-2021
      Nominating Committee those five meetings are IETFs 102, 103, 104,
      105, and 106.

   This update is an emergency interpretation of the intent of BCP 10
   for this current exceptional situation only, and applies only to the
   2020-2021 NomCom, which is expected to be seated prior to IETF 108,
   and to any rules or processes that relate to NomCom eligibility
   before IETF 108.  It will explicitly not apply to any future NomCom
   and does not set precedent: an update to BCP 10 will be necessary to
   address future eligibility, as there will be time for proper
   community work on such an update (see [ELIGIBILITYDISCUSS]).  That
   update could change any part of the BCP 10 process, including
   anything specified in this document.
