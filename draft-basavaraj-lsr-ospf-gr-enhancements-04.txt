1.  Introduction

   This document describes the enhancements to the current OSPF
   [RFC2328] and OSPFv3 [RFC5340] graceful restart procedures as
   respectively defined in OSPF Graceful Restart [RFC3623] and OSPFv3
   Graceful Restart [RFC5187] to improve routing convergence in certain
   OSPF network deployment scenarios.  The goal is for both the
   restarting OSPF node and the helper OSPF node to terminate the OSPF
   graceful restart procedure faster and not wait for the grace period
   expiry in those network scenarios and hence improve the overall OSPF
   network convergence.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Graceful Restart Enhancements

3.1.  Stub-Link Network Scenarios

          +--------+             +--------+            +--------+
          |Router-1|---Area 0----|Router-2|---Area 1---|Router-3|

Internet-Draft            OSPF GR Enhancements             December 2021


   As graphically depicted in figure 1, Router-2 is an area border
   router (ABR) with OSPF links in 2 areas.  Furthermore, Router-2 has
   formed full adjacencies only in Area 0.  In Area 1, Router-2 has an
   OSPF link enabled but Router2 could not form an adjacency either
   because Router-3 is down or Router-3 does not have OSPF enabled.
   Hence, Router-2 will only have a stub link in Area 1.

   On restart, the ABR router Router-2, having only a stub link in the
   Area 1, will never receive its pre-restart LSA in this area and will
   never form an adjacency and will have to wait for the grace period
   expiry leading to slower OSPF routing convergence.

   For this scenario, if no OSPF control packets are received within the
   dead interval on a link in Area 1 as per the above network scenario,
   Router-2 MUST mark the link as stub and MUST not wait for the grace
   period to form an adjacency on this link to successfully Exit GR.

3.2.  Multiple Failure Scenarios

   In scenarios where more than one router is restarting at the same
   time in the same OSPF area and StrictLSAChecking is disabled,
   restarting OSPF routers will end up waiting the entire grace interval
   to exit GR.  If the restarting routers receive a Grace Link State
   Advertisement (LSA) from another router in a given area after
   restart, and the helper routers receive grace LSAs from more than one
   router, this will indicate that there have been multiple failures.
   Therefore, the helper and restarting routers MUST terminate GR and
   avoid any unnecessary delay in OSPF routing convergence.

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in OSPF Graceful Restart [RFC3623] and
   OSPFv3 Graceful Restart [RFC5187] are applicable.  This document does
   not introduce any additional security considerations.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This specification doesn not require any IANA assignments.

6.  Acknowledgements
