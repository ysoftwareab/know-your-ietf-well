      Abstract 
          
         This document depicts a standard set of information to be 
         (dynamically) negotiated between a customer and an IP service 
         provider or between service providers, by means of instantiated 
         Service Level Specifications (SLS). It also specifies the 
         corresponding semantics of such information, so that it might be 
         appropriately modeled and processed by the above-mentioned parties in 
         an automated fashion.

      1. Introduction 
          
         The deployment of value-added IP service offerings over the Internet 
         has yielded a tremendous effort for the definition, the specification 
         and possibly the standardization of the notion of Quality of Service 
         (QoS), which generally encompasses a wide set of elementary 
         parameters, such as the maximum transit delay, the inter-packet delay 
         variation, or the packet loss rate. 
          
         Because the subscription to an IP service offering implies the 
         definition of a contractual agreement between the customer and the 
         corresponding IP Service Provider (ISP), the level of quality that 
         will be associated to the deployment of such service will be based 
         upon a set of the aforementioned parameters both parties will have to 
         agree upon.

      Internet Draft        Attributes of a SLS Template          October 2003 
                                           
                                           
         From this perspective, this document aims at listing (and promoting a 
         standard formalism for) a set of basic parameters that will compose 
         the elementary contents of a SLS, hence yielding the specification of 
         a (hopefully) standardized SLS template that should dramatically 
         facilitate the enforcement of IP QoS policies, especially with an 
         inter-domain context where QoS-based IP service offerings are 
         deployed over the whole Internet. 
          
         Thus, this document presents an outline for the definition of the SLS 
         parameters and the semantics that go behind this representation. As 
         such, the document is structured as follows: 
          
         - Section 4 lists the basic assumptions this work relies upon, and 
           also provides a glossary of the terms used in this draft, 
          
         - Section 5 specifies the SLS template, while section 6 provides some 
           example of SLS instantiations, with the goal to show how such 
           templates could be used, 
          
         - Finally, sections 7 and 8 provide a list of requirements as far as 
           the use of a SLS negotiation protocol is concerned, and some 
           security considerations, respectively. 
          
      2. Conventions used in this document 
          
         The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
         "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
         document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2]. 
          
      3. Changes since the Previous Version 
          
         The following changes have been made since the previous version of 
         the document: 
          
         - Most of the text has been cleaned up and the overall organization 
           of the document has been reviewed, 
          
         - A section on SLS negotiation protocol requirements has been added, 
          
         - Both the References and Authors' sections have been updated, 
          
         - Remaining typos have been corrected. 
          
      4. Basic Assumptions  
          
      4.1. A DiffServ-driven Approach 
          
         The basic assumption of this document is that IP service offerings 
         will be deployed over a public IP infrastructure (namely the 
         Internet) where part of if not all the network devices (namely the IP 
         routers) will be DiffServ-capable, as per [3]. In particular, these

      Internet Draft        Attributes of a SLS Template          October 2003 
                                           
                                           
         routers support Per Hop Behaviors (PHB), like the Assured Forwarding 
         (AF) PHB ([4]) and the Expedited Forwarding (EF) PHB ([5]). 
          
         In this document, ISPs are in charge of the exploitation of the 
         underlying IP infrastructure that will support the QoS-based IP 
         service offerings customers will have the ability to subscribe to, 
         while the level of quality associated to these services is 
         technically described in SLS templates. 
          
         Furthermore, the DiffServ-related terminology used in this document 
         fully complies with [6]. 
          
      4.2. Positioning SLS Templates in a Layered Model 
          
         The Differentiated Services specification effort has yielded the 
         identification of a set of elementary functions and concepts, whose 
         respective interactions can be depicted according to a layered 
         approach, as per the following figure 1.

                         Fig. 1: A Layered Model of DiffServ. 
          
         As per figure 1, each of the layer displays its own QoS capabilities. 
         According to the definition of a Per-Domain Behavior (PDB, [7]), the 
         specification of such PDBs should include the reference to the (lower 
         layer) PHB(s) the PDB "layer" relies upon. 
          
         Furthermore, the mapping between instantiated SLS templates and PDBs 
         remains an unexplored area: for example, a SLS is service-oriented 
         and customer-specific, whereas a PDB is customer-unaware.

      Internet Draft        Attributes of a SLS Template          October 2003 
                                           
                                           
          
      5. Service Level Specification Template 
          
         The following sub-sections provide a description of the attributes 
         that MAY be conveyed and valued in a given SLS template. 
          
      5.1. The Scope Attribute 
          
         The Scope attribute of a SLS template indicates where the QoS policy 
         for the corresponding IP service offering is to be enforced. 
         Therefore, the scope uniquely identifies the network region where the 
         QoS policy will be enforced, by defining the boundaries of such 
         region. 
          
         The scope of a SLS MUST be expressed by a couple of ingress and 
         egress interfaces. Ingress and egress respectively denote the entry 
         and exit points of the network region that will convey the IP 
         datagrams associated to the corresponding service offering.  
          
         The introduction of the notion of ingress and egress interfaces 
         implicitly states that SLS templates refer to uni-directional IP 
         flows, where an IP flow is a set of IP datagrams that share at least 
         one common characteristic, e.g. the same destination address. 
         Obviously, the direction dimension of a SLS template does not exclude 
         the provisioning of bi-directional SLS templates, thanks to the 
         combination of at least two SLS templates. 
          
      5.1.1. Semantics of the Scope Attribute 
          
         Scope = (ingress, egress), where: 
          
         - Ingress = Interface (I/F) Identifier | Set of I/F Identifiers | Any 
          
         - Egress = Interface Identifier | Set of I/F Identifiers | Any 
          
         Note that "|" denotes an exclusive OR, while "Any" is logically 
         equivalent to "Unspecified". 
          
      5.1.2. Possible Combinations of the Scope Attribute 
          
         The following combinations are permitted: 
          
         (1, 1), which reflects a one-to-one (peer-to-peer) communication. 
         This kind of scope refers to "Pipe" SLS templates in the rest of the 
         document, 
          
         (1, N), which reflects a one-to-many communication (N > 1), e.g. a 
         videoconferencing service. This kind of scope refers to "Hose" SLS 
         templates in the rest of the document,

      Internet Draft        Attributes of a SLS Template          October 2003 
                                           
                                           
         (1, Any), which reflects a one-to-any communication, e.g. a 
         broadcasting service, 
          
         (N, 1), which reflects a many-to-one communication, e.g. an IP 
         Virtual Private Network (VPN) service offering, deployed according to 
         a hub-and-spoke topology. This kind of scope refers to "Funnel" SLS 
         templates in the rest of the document, 
          
         (Any, 1), which reflects an any-to-one communication (e.g. all the IP 
         traffic of a stub domain that has a single exit point towards the 
         Internet). 
          
         This scope taxonomy currently excludes the case of many-to-many 
         communication types, which would be denoted as (M, N) according to 
         the above semantics: either the ingress or the egress interfaces MUST 
         be unique, whereas scopes of the (M, N) type could be de-composed 
         into M instances of scopes of the (1, N) types, a.k.a. M instances of 
         Hose SLSes. 
          
         Also, there SHOULD be a 1:1 relationship between the interface 
         identifier and the link the interface is attached to. The 
         corresponding link identifier MAY be an IP address, but it may also 
         be any other identification means both parties (customer and 
         provider) would have agreed upon: for example, layer 2 link 
         identifiers could be used in either Ethernet or PPP (Point-to-Point 
         Protocol, [8]) access links. 
          
      5.2. The Flow Identifier (Flow ID) Attribute 
          
         The Flow Identifier (Flow ID) attribute of a SLS template refers to 
         the IP flow, defined as a set of IP datagrams that share at least one 
         common characteristic, and which corresponds to the IP service 
         offering whose level of quality is technically depicted in the 
         aforementioned SLS. This parameter provides an input for IP datagram 
         classification to be performed by a DiffServ boundary node. Such a 
         classification can either reflect a Behavior Aggregate (BA) or a 
         Multi-Field (MF) taxonomy. 
          
         The MF-based classification may either depict micro-flows or macro-
         flows, based on the source prefix attribute, for example (see section 
         5.2.1 below). 
          
      5.2.1. Semantics of the Flow ID Attribute 
          
         A given SLS template MUST contain one and only one Flow ID attribute, 
         which MAY formally be described by one or a combination of the 
         following attribute. 
          
         Flow ID = {DiffServ Information, Source information, Destination

           Destination Port | (Source Port, Destination Port) | Any 
          
      5.2.2. Usage of the Flow ID Attribute 
          
         In the case of a BA-based classification, the DiffServ information 
         MUST be provided, while the remaining information of the Flow ID 
         attribute MUST NOT be specified. As an example, an Ordered Aggregate 
         (OA) that defines a stream of AF-marked IP datagrams could be 
         described by a single Flow ID attribute using several DSCP values, 
         indicating as many drop precedence levels. Note that the DSCP value 
         of the Flow ID's DiffServ information does not necessarily relate to 
         a specific PHB, but rather is a means (among others) for identifying 
         an IP flow. 
          
         In the case where the Flow IP attribute is valued with the (IP source 
         address, IP destination address) pair while the Scope attribute is 
         left unspecified, there is therefore no specific assumption about the 
         ingress and egress points that the corresponding traffic will cross. 
         Furthermore, it is the responsibility of the service provider to 
         select the route (thanks to the enforcement of a routing if not a 
         traffic engineering policy) that will convey this traffic across the 
         DiffServ domain. 
          
         On the other hand, if both the Scope and Flow ID attributes of a SLS 
         template have been specified so that the (Ingress I/F, Egress I/F) 
         pair as well as the (Source IP Address, Destination IP Address) pair 
         have been explicitly valued, then the route followed by the flow 
         between the two hosts MUST go through the Ingress and Egress 
         interfaces.  
          
      5.3. The Performance Attribute 
          
         The Performance attribute describes the network level of quality that 
         is associated to the transportation of an IP flow, as it has been 
         defined by the Flow ID attribute of the SLS template, and within the 
         limits defined by the Scope attribute of the same SLS template. 
          
         The Performance attribute is a set of indicators, and four indicators 
         have been defined so far, according to the following semantics.

      Internet Draft        Attributes of a SLS Template          October 2003 
                                           
                                           
      5.3.1. Semantics of the Performance Attribute 
          
         The following indicators compose the Performance attribute of a SLS 
         template. 
          
         - One-way delay ([9]), measurement period, optional quantile 
          
         - Inter-packet delay variation ([10]), measurement period, optional 
           quantile 
          
         - Packet loss rate ([11]), measurement period 
          
         - Throughput, measurement period 
          
         For a given SLS template, all these indicators refer to an IP flow 
         which has been described by the valued Flow ID attribute of the SLS, 
         and within the ingress and egress domain boundaries, as per the Scope 
         attribute of the SLS. Such indicators are measured during a period of 
         time which is specified by the "measurement period" indication 
         associated to each indicator. 
          
         The quantile indication is an optional parameter that is relevant to 
         reflect an empirical gauge of the corresponding performance 
         indicators. For example, a SLS template whose Performance attribute 
         would contain the triplet (delay = 10 ms, measurement period = 5 min, 
         quantile = 10E-3) means that the customer's expectation is that the 
         probability of delays greater than 10 ms is less than 10E-3 for any 
         measurement period of 5 minutes. 
          
         Such Performance attribute semantics therefore yields the 
         specification of arrays like N (delay/loss, quantile) pairs. The more 
         pairs, the better the delay probability can be approximated as a tail 
         distribution. 
          
         As for the throughput indicator, it is measured at the egress point 
         (as defined in the Scope attribute of the SLS), by counting all the 
         outgoing IP datagrams described by the Flow ID attribute of the SLS. 
          
      5.3.2. Quantitative aspects of the Performance Attribute 
          
         One of the performance indicators of the Performance attribute is 
         said to be quantitative whenever its value is expressed as a numeric 
         value. Then, the QoS reflected by an instantiated SLS is said to be 
         quantitative when at least one of the indicators of the Performance 
         attribute of the SLS is quantified. 
          
      5.3.3. Qualitative aspects of the Performance Attribute 
          
         If none of the indicators of the Performance attribute of a given SLS 
         has been quantified, then such indicators MAY be valued so that they 
         reflect a qualitative QoS. The corresponding values of these

      Internet Draft        Attributes of a SLS Template          October 2003 
                                           
                                           
         indicators MAY therefore be of the following kind: "low", "medium", 
         "high". 
          
         From a commercial perspective, such values MAY be associated to the 
         definition of QoS-based IP service offerings, such as the "Bronze" 
         service (e.g. with a delay indicator valued at "high"), the "Silver" 
         service, (e.g. with a loss indicator valued at "medium"), and the 
         "Gold" service (e.g. with a (delay, loss) pair valued at "low"). 
          
      5.4. The Traffic Conformance Attribute 
          
         The Traffic Conformance attribute of a SLS template is a set of 
         indicators that aim at describing how an IP flow (as depicted by the 
         Flow ID attribute of the SLS) should "look like" (e.g. in terms of 
         volume (per unit of time)) so that the customer be serviced according 
         to the level of quality that has been described in the Performance 
         attribute of the SLS for this traffic. 
          
         The indicators of the Traffic Conformance attribute are the input 
         data for traffic conformance algorithms, whereas traffic conformance 
         testing functions are operated at the boundaries of a DiffServ 
         domain, thanks to the contents of the Traffic Conformance attribute 
         and the aforementioned algorithm. 
          
         Basic traffic conformance testing relies upon a set of actions that 
         yield the identification of "in-profile" and "out-of-profile" IP 
         datagrams of a given IP flow (as depicted by the Flow ID attribute of 
         the SLS). From this standpoint, the indicators that have been valued 
         in the Traffic Conformance attribute of a given SLS describe the 
         reference values the IP flow will have to comply with, hence the 
         notions of "in-profile" and "out-of-profile" traffics. 
          
         The traffic conformance algorithm is the means that unambiguously 
         identifies in-profile and out-of-profile IP datagrams, based upon the 
         valued indicators of the Traffic Conformance attribute of the SLS. 
          
         Furthermore, there MAY be cases where traffic conformance testing 
         actions are iterative, hence the notion of multi-level traffic 
         conformance testing, where an IP datagram of a given flow will be 
         tagged (thanks to a particular action taken by the traffic 
         conformance algorithm) to reflect its belonging to a specific level. 
          
         In such cases, the Traffic Conformance attribute of the SLS template 
         MUST indicate the level the indicators refer to. 
          
      5.4.1. Semantics of the Traffic Conformance attribute 
          
         Indicators that MAY be conveyed by the Traffic Conformance attribute 
         include: 
          
         - Multi-Level Conformance Testing n (n being an integer)

      Internet Draft        Attributes of a SLS Template          October 2003 
                                           
                                           
          
         - Peak Rate p (expressed in bits per second or kilobits per second) 
          
         - Token Bucket Rate r (expressed in bits per second or kilobits per 
           second) 
          
         - Bucket Depth b (expressed in bytes) 
          
         - Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU) M (expressed in bytes) 
          
         - Minimum Packet Size m (expressed in bytes). 
          
      5.4.2. Usage of the Traffic Conformance attribute 
          
      5.4.2.1. Basic Conformance Testing 
          
         Basic conformance testing MAY rely upon the use of a token bucket 
         algorithm, whereas the indicators of the Traffic Conformance 
         attribute of the SLS template will be the token bucket rate r and the 
         bucket depth b. 
          
         Also, when defining the MTU indicator of the Traffic Conformance 
         attribute of the SLS, then the corresponding conformance algorithm 
         will consist in the following: 
          
         - If the size of the incoming IP datagram is smaller or equal to MTU, 
           then the datagram will be forwarded, 
          
         - If the size of the incoming datagrams is strictly greater than the 
           MTU, then the datagram will be dropped. 
          
      5.4.2.2. Two-Level Conformance Testing 
          
         A two-rate three-colour marker relies upon the use of two token 
         buckets, whose respective rates are denoted r1 and r2 (with r2 > r1). 
         Both buckets contain green and yellow tokens, respectively. In this 
         case (where the indicators of the Traffic Conformance attribute of 
         the SLS are the (r1, b1) and (r2, b2) characteristics of the token 
         buckets), a simple traffic conformance algorithm is the following: 
          
         - If there are green and yellow tokens left in the respective 
           buckets, an incoming datagram will be tagged "green", 
          
         - If there are yellow tokens left only, an incoming datagram will be 
           tagged "yellow", 
          
         - The incoming datagram will be tagged "red" otherwise. 
          
      5.5. The Excess Treatment Attribute

      Internet Draft        Attributes of a SLS Template          October 2003 
                                           
                                           
         The SLS template MUST describe how out-of-profile traffic flows will 
         be processed, and this is the role of the Excess Treatment attribute. 
         By default, if the Excess Treatment attribute is not specified in the 
         SLS template, in excess traffic will be dropped. 
         As a consequence, the semantics of the Excess Treatment attribute of 
         the SLS template will consist in describing a specific action to be 
         taken by the (DiffServ-enabled) router: such actions MAY consist in 
         re-marking the IP datagrams (i.e. modifying the value of the DSCP 
         bits), storing in-excess traffic in specific queues, etc. (a 
         combination of elementary actions, e.g. "re-mark then store" SHOULD 
         also be possible). 
          
      5.6. The Service Schedule Attribute 
          
         The Service Schedule attribute of a SLS template reflects the 
         "working hours" of the corresponding service, by indicating both 
         start and end times of the service. This attribute might be expressed 
         as a collection of the following indicators: 
          
         - Time of the day range, e.g. a service is available from 08:00 to 
           17:00, 
          
         - Day of the week range, e.g. a service available from Monday to 
           Friday, 
          
         - Month of the year range, e.g. the service is available from June 
           2003. 
          
      5.7. The Reliability Attribute 
          
         The Reliability attribute of a SLS reflects the maximum Mean Down 
         Time (MDT) per year, as well as the maximum Mean Time To Repair 
         (MTTR) as far as the availability of the service is concerned. 
         Reference units for the Reliability attribute SHOULD be minutes per 
         year for the MDT indicator, and seconds for the MTTR indicator. 
          
      5.8. Additional Attributes 
          
         The current version of this draft has proposed and defined a set of 
         attributes that SHOULD be conveyed in a SLS template. Obviously, 
         there may be a need for conveying additional information, and updated 
         versions of this document should reflect such requirement as 
         appropriate. 
          
      6. Examples of Instantiated SLS Templates 
          
      6.1. SLS for a Virtual Leased Line Service 
          
         Let us assume the availability of a (unidirectional) Virtual Leased 
         Line (VLL) service offering, provided with a guaranteed throughput of 

       
      Goderis et al.  Best Current Practice - Exp. April 2004       [Page 11] 
       
       
      Internet Draft        Attributes of a SLS Template          October 2003 
                                           
                                           
         1 Mbit/s, a guaranteed one-way transit delay of 20 ms for a 10E-3 
         quantile, as well as a guaranteed packet loss rate of 0%. 
          
         Therefore, the value attributes of the corresponding SLS template 
         will be the following: 
          
         - Scope = (1, 1) 
          
         - Flow ID = ((Set of) Source Addresses, (Set of) Destination 
           Addresses, EF marking) - there may be several IP networks that may 
           communicate through this virtual leased line, and all the IP 
           traffic that will be conveyed by this VLL will be EF-marked. 
          
         - Traffic Conformance = (b, r, drop), where r = 1 Mbit/s (token 
           bucket algorithm), and out-of-profile traffic will be dropped. 
          
         - Performance = (20 ms, 5 min, 10E-3, 0%), where delay = 20 ms, 
           measured during a period of 5 minutes with an associated quantile 
           of 10E-3, and with a 0% of packet loss rate (which implies that the 
           throughput guarantee is identical to the token bucket rate r, hence 
           1 Mbit/s. 
          
         - Service Schedule = (24/24, 7/7) - for example. 
          
         - Reliability = (MTTR = 30 s) - for example. 
          
         In this example, it's worth mentioning that the throughput guarantee 
         has been derived from the packet loss rate, the token bucket rate and 
         the action to be taken for out-of-profile traffic (drop). 
          
      6.2. The Funnel Service 
          
         The Funnel service would aim at protecting local traffic (within an 
         enterprise) from Internet traffic, such as HTTP. An example of such 
         service is depicted in figure 2 below: 
          
                              /-------------------\ 
                              |                   | 
                              | Network    -------|-- B 
                              |           /       | 
                   A ---------|-------------------|-- C 
                              |           \       | 
                     <-a(out) |            -------|-- D 
                              |                   | 
                              \-------------------/ 
                                            
                         Fig. 2: Example of a Funnel Service. 
          
         In figure 2, customer A requires that the traffic entering his 
         network and coming from B, C or D, does not exceed the a(out) rate.

      Internet Draft        Attributes of a SLS Template          October 2003 
                                           
                                           
         The attributes of the corresponding SLS would therefore be the 
         following: 
          
         - Scope = (N, 1) 
          
         - Flow ID = (DSCP). The filter for incoming traffic will be applied 
           on the DSCP marking. 
          
         - Traffic Conformance = (b, r, drop). The token bucket algorithm 
           reflects the maximum allowed (incoming) throughput (r = a(out)) on 
           the specified egress interface, as defined in the Scope attribute. 
           Out-of-profile traffic will be dropped. 
          
      6.3. SLS for Best Effort Traffic 
          
         The attributes of a Best Effort (BE) SLS would be the following: 
          
         - Scope = all combinations that have been defined in section 5.1.2 of 
           the document. 
          
         There would be no indication of the Flow ID attribute, nor the 
         Traffic Conformance, nor the Performance attributes. Nevertheless, 
         both the Service Schedule and the Reliability attributes MAY be 
         valued. 
          
      7. SLS Negotiation Protocol Requirements 
          
         The information that is conveyed in SLS templates by means of 
         specific attributes will be negotiated between the customer and the 
         service provider parties. As such, this information will be exchanged 
         thanks to a communication protocol, which SHOULD address the 
         following requirements. 
          
         - The SLS negotiation protocol should use of a reliable transport 
           mode, given the importance of the QoS information to be exchanged 
           between the customer and the service provider, 
          
         - The protocol architecture should provide a means for a dynamic SLS 
           negotiation and subscription procedure, so that it may introduce a 
           high level of automation in the actual negotiation and invocation 
           of the corresponding IP service offerings, 
          
         - The protocol should support a reporting mechanism that may be used 
           for statistical information retrieval, 
          
         - The protocol should support the appropriate security mechanisms to 
           provide some guarantees as far as the preservation of the 
           confidentiality of the information contained in a SLS template is 
           concerned.

      Internet Draft        Attributes of a SLS Template          October 2003 
                                           
                                           
      8. Security Considerations 
          
         This draft has identified a set of information that will be exchanged 
         between a customer and a service provider by means of a SLS template 
         negotiation and instantiation procedure. As such, it raises the issue 
         of the security associated to the provisioning of such information, 
         by means of a protocol which should be able to address the 
         requirements discussed in the previous section 7. In particular, the 
         following security features SHOULD be considered: 
          
         - Identification and authentication of the requesting entity (a.k.a. 
           the customer), if not both parties, 
          
         - Identification and authentication of the peering entities that will 
           participate in the SLS negotiation process, 
          
         - Preservation of the confidentiality of the information to be 
           exchanged between both parties during the SLS negotiation and 
           instantiation procedures.
