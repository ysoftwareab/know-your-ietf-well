     1. Introduction 

      
     This  draft  describes  the  methodology  for  benchmarking  MPLS  based 
     protection mechanisms. The new terminology that it introduces is defined 
     in [TERM-ID].  
      
     MPLS based protection mechanisms provide faster recovery of real time 
     services in case of an unplanned link or node failure in the network 
     core, where MPLS is used as a signaling protocol to setup point-to-point 
     traffic engineered tunnels. MPLS based protection mechanisms improve 
     service availability by minimizing the duration of the most common 
     failures.  There  are  generally  two  factors  impacting  service 
     availability. One is the frequency and the other is the duration of the

     Internet-Draft     Methodology for benchmarking MPLS      July 2007 
                             Protection Mechanisms  
     failure. Unexpected correlated failures are less common. Correlated 
     failures mean co-occurrence of two or more failures simultaneously. 
     These failures are often observed when two or more logical resources 
     (for e.g. layer-2 links), relying on a common physical resource (for 
     e.g. common transport) fail. Common transport may include TDM and WDM 
     links providing multiplexing at layer-2 and layer-1. Within the context 
     of MPLS protection mechanisms, Shared Risk Link Groups [MPLS-FRR-EXT] 
     encompass correlations failures.  
      
     Not all correlated failures can be anticipated in advance of their 
     occurrence. Failures due to natural disasters or planned failures are 
     the most notable causes. Due to the frequent occurrences of such 
     failures, it is necessary that implementations can handle these faults 
     gracefully, and recover the services affected by failures very quickly.  
      
     Some  routers  recover  faster  as  compared  to  the  others,  hence 
     benchmarking this type of failures become very useful. Benchmarking of 
     unexpected   correlated   failures   should   include   measurement   of 
     restoration with and without the availability of IP fallback. This 
     document provides detailed test cases focusing on benchmarking MPLS 
     protection mechanisms. Benchmarking of unexpected correlated failures 
     is currently out of scope of this document. 
      
     A link or a node failure could occur either at the head-end or at the 
     mid point node of a primary tunnel. The backup tunnel could offer either 
     link or node protection following a failure along the path of the 
     primary tunnel. The time lapsed in transitioning primary tunnel traffic 
     to the backup tunnel is a key measurement that ensures the service level 
     agreements. Failover time depends upon many factors such as the number 
     of prefixes bound to a tunnel, services (such as IGP, BGP, Layer 3/ 
     Layer 2 VPNs) that are bound to the tunnel, number of primary tunnels 
     affected by the failure event, number of primary tunnels protected by 
     backup, the type of failure and the physical media on which the failover 
     occurs. This document describes all different topologies and scenarios 
     that should be considered to effectively benchmark MPLS protection 
     mechanisms and failover times. Different failure scenarios and scaling 
     considerations are also provided in this document. In addition the 
     document provides a reporting format for the observed results.

     Internet-Draft     Methodology for benchmarking MPLS      July 2007 
                             Protection Mechanisms  
     To benchmark the failover time, data plane traffic is used as defined in 
     [IGP-METH]. Traffic loss is the key component in a black-box type test 
     and is used to measure convergence. 
      
      
     All benchmarking test cases defined in this document apply to both 
     facility backup and local protection enabled in detour mode. The test 
     cases cover all possible failure scenarios and the associated procedures 
     benchmark the ability of the DUT to perform recovery from failures 
     within target failover time.  
      
     Figure 1 represents the basic reference test bed and is applicable to 
     all the test cases defined in this document. TG & TA represents Traffic 
     Generator & Analyzer respectively. A tester is connected to the DUT and 
     it sends and receives IP traffic along with the working Path, run 
     protocol emulations simulating real world peering scenarios.

     The tester MUST record the number of lost, duplicate, and reordered 
     packets. It should further record arrival and departure times so that 
     Failover Time, Additive Latency, and Reversion Time can be measured.

     The tester may be a single device or a test system emulating all the 
     different roles along a primary or backup path. 
      
      
      
     2. Existing definitions 

     For the sake of clarity and continuity this RFC adopts the template 
     for definitions set out in Section 2 of RFC 1242.  Definitions are 
     indexed and grouped together in sections for ease of reference. 
      
     The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
     "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
     this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. 
      
     The reader is assumed to be familiar with the commonly used MPLS  
     terminology, some of which is defined in [MPLS-FRR-EXT].   
      
      
          
     3. Test Considerations 

        This section discusses the fundamentals of MPLS Protection testing:  

            -The types of network events that causes failover 
            -Indications for failover 
            -the use of data traffic 
            -Traffic generation 
            -LSP Scaling 
            -Reversion of LSP 
            -IGP Selection 
         
         
      3.1. Failover Events 

        The failover to the backup tunnel is primarily triggered by either a 
        link or node failures observed downstream of the Point of Local 
        repair (PLR). Some of these failure events are listed below.  

        Link failure events

            - Interface Shutdown on remote side with BFD 
            - Fiber Pull on the PLR side (Both TX & RX or just the Tx) 
            - Fiber Pull on the remote side (Both TX & RX or just the Rx) 
            - Online insertion and removal (OIR) on PLR side   
            - OIR on remote side   
            - Sub-interface failure (e.g. shutting down of a VLAN) 
            - Parent interface shutdown (an interface bearing multiple sub-
          interfaces 
             
         
        Node failure events 
         
        A System reload is initiated either by a graceful shutdown or by a 
        power failure. A system crash is referred to as a software failure or 
        an assert. 
         
            - Reload protected Node, when RSVP Hello is enabled 
            - Crash  Protected Node, when RSVP Hello is enable  
            - Reload Protected Node, when BFD is enable 
            - Crash  Protected Node, when BFD is enable 
         
             
      3.2. Failure Detection [TERM-ID] 

        Local failures can be detected via SONET/SDH failure with directly 
        connected LSR.  Failure indication may vary with the type of alarm - 
        LOS, AIS, or RDI. Failures on Ethernet links such as Gigabit Ethernet 
        rely upon Layer 3 signaling indication for failure.   

        Different MPLS protection mechanisms and different implementations 
        use different failure detection techniques such as RSVP hellos, BFD 
        etc. Ethernet technologies such as Gigabit Ethernet rely upon layer 3 
        failure indication mechanisms since there is no Layer 2 failure 
        indication mechanism. The failure detection time may not always be 
        negligible and it could impact the overall failover time. 

        The test procedures in this document can be used for a local failure 
        or remote failure scenarios for comprehensive benchmarking and to

                             Protection Mechanisms  
        evaluate failover performance independent of the failure detection 
        techniques. 

     

    3.3. Use of Data Traffic for MPLS Protection Benchmarking 

        Currently end customers use packet loss as a key metric for failover 
        time. Packet loss is an externally observable event and has direct 
        impact on customers' applications.  MPLS protection mechanism is 
        expected to minimize the packet loss in the event of a failure. For 
        this reason it is important to develop a standard router benchmarking 
        methodology for measuring MPLS protection that uses packet loss as a 
        metric.  At a known rate of forwarding, packet loss can be measured 
        and the Failover time can be determined. Measurement of control plane    
        signaling to establish backup paths is not enough to verify failover. 
        Failover is best determined when packets are actually traversing the 
        backup path.  

        An additional benefit of using packet loss for calculation of 
        Failover time is that it allows use of a black-box tests environment. 
        Data traffic is offered at line-rate to the device under test (DUT), 
        and an emulated network failure event is forced to occur, and packet 
        loss is externally measured to calculate the convergence time. This 
        setup is independent of the DUT architecture.  

        In addition, this methodology considers the packets in error and 
        duplicate packets that could have been generated during the failover 
        process. In scenarios, where separate measurement of packets in error 
        and duplicate packets is difficult to obtain, these packets should be 
        attributed to lost packets. 

         

      3.4. LSP and Route Scaling 

        Failover time performance may vary with the number of established 
        primary and backup tunnels (LSP) and installed routes. However the 
        procedure outlined here should be used for any number of LSPs (L) and 
        number of routes protected by PLR(R). Number of L and R must be 
        recorded.

      3.5. Selection of IGP 

        The underlying IGP could be ISIS-TE or OSPF-TE for the methodology 
        proposed here.      

         

         

      3.6. Reversion [TERM-ID] 

        Fast Reroute provides a method to return or restore a backup path to 
        original primary LSP upon recovery from the failure. This is referred 
        to as Reversion, which can be implemented as Global Reversion or 
        Local Reversion. In all test cases listed here Reversion should not 
        produce any packet loss, out of order or duplicate packets. Each of 
        the test cases in this methodology document provides a check to 
        confirm that there is no packet loss.   

       

      3.7. Traffic generation 

        It is suggested that there be one or more traffic streams as long as 
        there is a steady and constant rate of flow for all the streams.  In 
        order to monitor the DUT performance for recovery times a set of 
        route prefixes should be advertised before traffic is sent. The 
        traffic should be configured towards these routes.  

        A typical example would be configuring the traffic generator to send 
        the traffic to the first, middle and last of the advertised routes. 
        (First, middle and last could be decided by the numerically smallest, 
        median and the largest respectively of the advertised prefix). 
        Generating traffic to all of the prefixes reachable by the protected 
        tunnel (probably in a Round-Robin fashion, where the traffic is 
        destined to all the prefixes but one prefix at a time in a cyclic 
        manner) is not recommended. The reason why traffic generation is not 
        recommended in a Round-Robin fashion to all the prefixes, one at a 
        time is that if there are many prefixes reachable through the LSP the 
        time interval between 2 packets destined to one prefix may be 
        significantly high and may be comparable with the failover time being 
        measured  which  does  not  aid  in  getting  an  accurate  failover 
        measurement.

      3.8. Motivation for topologies 

         

        Given that the label stack is dependent of the following 3 entities 
        it is recommended that the benchmarking of failover time be performed 
        on all the 8 topologies provided in section 4 

            - Type of protection (Link Vs Node) 

            - # of remaining hops of the primary tunnel from the PLR 

            - # of remaining hops of the backup tunnel from the PLR 

      

     4. Test Setup 

        Topologies to be used for benchmarking the failover time: 

        This section proposes a set of topologies that covers all the 
        scenarios for local protection. All of these 8 topologies shown 
        (figure 2- figure 9) can be mapped to the reference topology shown in 
        figure 1. Topologies provided in sections 4.1 to 4.8 refer to test-
        bed required to benchmark failover time when DUT is configured as a 
        PLR in either head-end or midpoint role. The labels stack provided 
        with each topology is at the PLR. 

        The label stacks shown below each figure in section 4.1 to 4.9 
        considers enabling of Penultimate Hop Popping (PHP).  

        Figures 2-9 uses the following convention: 

        a) HE is Head-End 

        b) TE is Tail-End 

        c) MID is Mid point 

        d) MP is Merge Point 

        e) PLR is Point of Local Repair 

        f) PRI is Primary

     5. Test Methodology 

        The procedure described in this section can be applied to all the 8 
        base test cases and the associated topologies. The backup as well as 
        the primary tunnel are configured to be alike in terms of bandwidth 
        usage. In order to benchmark failover with all possible label stack 
        depth applicable as seen with current deployments, it is suggested 
        that the methodology includes all the scenarios listed here

          5.1. Headend as PLR with link failure  

          Objective 

          To benchmark the MPLS failover time due to Link failure events      
          described in section 3.1 experienced by the DUT which is the point 
          of local repair (PLR).  

           Test Setup 

             - select any one topology out of 8 from section 4   
             - select overlay technology for FRR test e.g. IGP,VPN,or VC       
             - The DUT will also have 2 interfaces connected to the traffic  
               Generator/analyzer. (If the node downstream of the PLR is not 
               A simulated node, then the Ingress of the tunnel should have  
               one link connected to the traffic generator and the node  
               downstream to the PLR or the egress of the tunnel should have 
               a link connected to the traffic analyzer). 
                
              
           Test Configuration 
         
            1.  Configure the number of primaries on R2 and the backups on 
                 R2 as required by the topology selected.   
            2.   Advertise prefixes (as per FRR Scalability table describe in  
                 Appendix A) by the tail end.  
         
                 
           Procedure  
         
             1. Establish the primary lsp on R2 required by the topology 
                 selected 
             2. Establish the backup lsp on R2 required by the selected 
                 topology 
             3. Verify primary and backup lsps are up and that primary is 
                 protected  
             4. Verify Fast Reroute protection is enabled and ready 
             5. Setup traffic streams as described in section 3.7  
             6. Send IP traffic at maximum Forwarding Rate to DUT.  
             7. Verify traffic switched over Primary LSP.

             9. Verify that primary tunnel and prefixes gets mapped to 
                 backup tunnels    
             10. Stop traffic stream and measure the traffic loss. 
             11. Failover time is calculated as defined in section 6, 
                 Reporting format.  
             12. Start traffic stream again to verify reversion when 
                 protected interface comes up. Traffic loss should be 0 due 
                 to make before break or reversion.  
             13. Enable protected interface that was down (Node in the case 
                 of NNHOP)

             Minimum failover time                    milliseconds 
             Mean failover time                       milliseconds 
             Maximum failover time                    milliseconds 
             Minimum reversion time                   milliseconds 
             Mean reversion time                      milliseconds 
             Maximum reversion time                   milliseconds 
         
         
        Failover time suggested above is calculated using one of the 
        following 3 methods 
         

           1. Packet-Based Loss method (PBLM): (Number of packets 
             dropped/packets per second * 1000) milliseconds. This method 
             could also be referred as Rate Derived method. 

           2. Time-Based Loss Method (TBLM): This method relies on the 
             ability of the Traffic generators to provide statistics which 
             reveal the duration of failure in milliseconds based on when the 
             packet loss occurred (interval between non-zero packet loss and 
             zero loss). 

           3. Timestamp Based Method (TBM): This method of failover 
             calculation is based on the timestamp that gets transmitted as 
             payload in the packets originated by the generator. The Traffic 
             Analyzer records the timestamp of the last packet received 
             before the failover event and the first packet after the 
             failover and derives the time based on the difference between 
             these 2 timestamps. Note: The payload could also contain 
             sequence numbers for out-of-order packet calculation and 
             duplicate packets. 

        Note: If the primary is configured to be dynamic, and if the primary    
        is to reroute, make before break should occur from the backup that is 
        in use to a new alternate primary. If there is any packet loss seen, 
        it should be added to failover time.

     8. Security Considerations 

        Benchmarking activities as described in this memo are limited to 
        technology characterization using controlled stimuli in a laboratory 
        environment, with dedicated address space and the constraints 
        specified in the sections above.  

        The benchmarking network topology will be an independent test setup 
        and MUST NOT be connected to devices that may forward the test 
        traffic into a production network, or misroute traffic to the test   
        management network. 

        Further, benchmarking is performed on a "black-box" basis, relying   
        solely on measurements observable external to the DUT/SUT.  

        Special capabilities SHOULD NOT exist in the DUT/SUT specifically   
        for benchmarking purposes. Any implications for network security    
        arising from the DUT/SUT SHOULD be identical in the lab and in    
        production networks. 

         

        The isolated nature of the benchmarking environments and the fact   
        that no special features or capabilities, other than those used in   
        operational networks, are enabled on the DUT/SUT requires no   
        security considerations specific to the benchmarking process.

        Appendix A: Fast Reroute Scalability Table 

        This section provides the recommended numbers for evaluating the 
        scalability of fast reroute implementations. It also recommends the 
        typical numbers for IGP/VPNv4 Prefixes, LSP Tunnels and VC entries. 
        Based on the features supported by the device under test, appropriate 
        scaling limits can be used for the test bed.
