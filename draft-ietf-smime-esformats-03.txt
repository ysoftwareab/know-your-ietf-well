Abstract

The informational RFC defines the format of an electronic signature 
that can remain valid over long periods. This includes evidence as to 
its validity even if the signer or verifying party later attempts to 
deny (i.e. repudiates, see [ISONR]) the validity of the signature.

The format can be considered as an extension to RFC 2630 [CMS] and RFC 
2634 [ESS], where, when appropriate additional signed and unsigned 
attributes have been defined.

The contents of this Informational RFC is technically equivalent to 
ETSI TS 101 733 V.1.2.2 Copyright (C). Individual copies of this

1.  Introduction

This document is intended to cover electronic signatures for various 
types of transactions, including business transactions (e.g. purchase 
requisition, contract, and invoice applications) where long term 
validity of such signatures is important. 

ETSI TC-SEC, Pinkas, Ross, Pope       Informational RFC        [Page 1]
Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats


Electronic signatures can be used for any transaction between an 
individual and a company, between two companies, between an individual 
and a governmental body, etc. This document is independent of any 
environment. It can be applied to any environment e.g. smart cards, GSM 
SIM cards, special programs for electronic signatures etc.

An electronic signature produced in accordance with this document 
provides evidence that can be processed to get confidence that some 
commitment has been explicitly endorsed under a signature policy, at a 
given time, by a signer under an identifier, e.g. a name or a 
pseudonym, and optionally a role.

The European Directive on a community framework for Electronic 
Signatures defines an electronic signature as: "data in electronic form 
which is attached to or logically associated with other electronic data 
and which serves as a method of authentication".  An electronic 
signature as used in the current document is a form of advanced 
electronic signature as defined in the Directive.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document (in uppercase,
as shown) are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2  Overview

2.1  Aim

The aim of this document is to define an Electronic Signature (ES) that 
remains valid over long periods. This includes evidence as to its 
validity even if the signer or verifying party later attempts to deny 
(repudiates) the validity of the signature.

This document specifies the use of trusted service providers (e.g. 
TimeStamping Authorities (TSA)), and the data that needs to be archived 
(e.g. cross certificates and revocation lists) to meet the requirements 
of long term electronic signatures. An electronic signature defined by 
this document can be used for arbitration in case of a dispute between 
the signer and verifier, which may occur at some later time, even years 
later. This document uses a signature policy, referenced by the signer, 
as the basis for establishing the validity of an electronic signature. 

2.2  Basis of Present Document

This document is based on the use of public key cryptography to produce 
digital signatures, supported by public key certificates.

A Public key certificate is a public keys of a user, together with some 
other information, rendered unforgeable by encipherment with the 
private key of the Certification Authority (CA) which issued it (ITU-T 
Recommendation X.509 [1]). 


ETSI TC-SEC, Pinkas, Ross, Pope       Informational RFC        [Page 4]
Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats


This document also specifies the uses of timestamping services to prove 
the validity of a signature long after the normal lifetime of critical 
elements of an electronic signature and to support non-repudiation. It 
also, as an option, defines the use of additional timestamps to provide 
very long-term protection against key compromise or weakened 
algorithms.

This document builds on existing standards that are widely adopted. 
This includes:

     * RFC 2459 [RFC2459] Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure 
       Certificate and CRL Profile (PKIX);
     * RFC 2630 [CMS] Crytographic Message Syntax (CMS);
     * RFC 2634 [ESS] Enhanced Security Services (ESS);
     * RFC 2439 [OCSP] One-line Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP);
     * ITU-T Recommendation X.509 [1] Authentication framework;
     * RFC (to be published) [TSP] PKIX Time Stamping protocol (TSP).

NOTE:  See clause 8 for a full set of references.

2.3  Major Parties

The following are the major parties involved in a business transaction 
supported by electronic signatures as defined in this document:

     * the Signer;
     * the Verifier;
     * the Arbitrator;
     * Trusted Service Providers (TSP).

A Signer is an entity that initially creates the electronic signature. 
When the signer digitally signs over data using the prescribed format, 
this represents a commitment on behalf of the signing entity to the 
data being signed. 

A verifier is an entity that verifies an evidence. (ISO/IEC 13888-1 
[13]). Within the context of this document this is an entity that 
validates an electronic signature.
An arbitrator, is an entity which arbitrates disputes between a signer 
and a verifier when there is a disagreement on the validity of a 
digital signature.

Trusted Service Providers (TSPs) are one or more entities that help 
to build trust relationships between the signer and verifier. Use of 
some specific TSP services MAY be mandated by signature policy. TSP 
supporting services may provide the following information: user 
certificates, cross-certificates, timestamping tokens, CRLs, ARLs, 
OCSP responses.






ETSI TC-SEC, Pinkas, Ross, Pope       Informational RFC        [Page 5]
Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats

The following TSPs are used to support the validation or 
the verification of electronic signatures :

     * Certification Authorities;
     * Registration Authorities;
     * Repository Authorities (e.g. a Directory);
     * TimeStamping Authorities;
     * One-line Certificate Status Protocol responders;
     * Attribute Authorities;
     * Signature Policy Issuers.

Certification Authorities provide users with public key certificates.

Registration Authorities allows the registration of entities before a 
CA generates certificates.

Repository Authorities publish CRLs issued by CAs, cross-certificates 
(i.e. CA certificates) issued by CAs, signature policies issued by 
Signature Policy Issuers and optionally public key certificates (i.e. 
leaf certificates) issued by CAs.

TimeStamping Authorities attest that some data was formed before a 
given trusted time. 

One-line Certificate Status Protocol responders (OSCP responders) 
provide information about the status (i.e. revoked, not revoked, 
unknown) of a particular certificate.

A Signature Policy Issuer issues signatures policies that define the 
technical and procedural requirements for electronic signature 
creation, validation and verification, in order to meet a particular 
business need.

Attributes Authorities provide users with attributes linked to public 
key certificates

2.4  Electronic Signatures and Validation Data

Validation of an electronic signature in accordance with this document 
requires:

     * The electronic signature; this includes:

        -  the signature policy;
        -  the signed user data;
        -  the digital signature;
        -  other signed attributes provided by the signer;
.       -  other unsigned attributes provided by the signer.

    * Validation data which is the additional data needed to validate 
      the electronic signature; this includes:

        -  certificates references;
        -  certificates;

ETSI TC-SEC, Pinkas, Ross, Pope       Informational RFC        [Page 6]
Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats

        -  revocation status information references;
        -  revocation status information;
        -  time-stamps from Time Stamping Authorities (TSAs).

     * The signature policy specifies the technical requirements on
       signature creation and validation in order to meet a particular
       business need. A given legal/contractual context may recognize a
       particular signature policy as meeting its requirements.

For example: a specific signature policy may be recognized by court 
of law as meeting the requirements of the European Directive for 
electronic commerce. A signature policy may be written using a formal 
notation like ASN.1 or in an informal free text form provided the 
rules of the policy are clearly identified. However, for a given 
signature policy there shall be one definitive form which has a unique 
binary encoded value.

Signed user data is the user's data that is signed.

The Digital Signature is the digital signature applied over the 
following attributes provided by the signer:

    * hash of the user data (message digest);
    * signature Policy Identifier;
    * other signed attributes 

The other signed attributes include any additional information which 
must be signed to conform to the signature policy or this document 
(e.g. signing time).

According to the requirements of a specific signature policy in use, 
various Validation Data shall be collected and attached to or 
associated with the signature structure by the signer and/or the 
verifier. The validation data includes CA certificates as well as 
revocation status information in the form of certificate revocation 
lists (CRLs) or certificate status information provided by an on-line 
service. Additional data also includes timestamps and other time 
related data used to provide evidence of the timing of given events. It 
is required, as a minimum, that either the signer or verifier obtains a 
timestamp over the signer's signature or a secure time record of the 
electronic signature must be maintained. Such secure records must not 
be undetectably modified and must record the time close to when the 
signature was first validated.


2.5  Forms of Validation Data

An electronic signature may exist in many forms including: 

    * the Electronic Signature (ES), which includes the digital 
      signature and other basic information provided by the signer;




ETSI TC-SEC, Pinkas, Ross, Pope       Informational RFC        [Page 7]
Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats

    * the ES with Timestamp (ES-T), which adds a timestamp to the 
      Electronic Signature, to take initial steps towards providing 
      long term validity;

    * the ES with Complete validation data (ES-C), which adds to the 
      ES-T references to the complete set of data supporting the 
      validity of the electronic signature (i.e. revocation status 
      information).

The signer must provide at least the ES form, but in some cases may 
decide to provide the ES-T form and in the extreme case could provide 
the ES-C form. If the signer does not provide ES-T, the verifier must 
either create the ES-T on first receipt of an electronic signature or 
shall keep a secure time record of the ES. Either of these two 
approaches provide independent evidence of the existence of 
the signature at the time it was first verified which should be near 
the time it was created, and so protects against later repudiation of 
the existence of the signature. If the signer does not provide ES-C the 
verifier must create the ES-C when the complete set of revocation and 
other validation data is available.

The ES satisfies the legal requirements for electronic signatures as 
defined in the European Directive on electronic signatures, see Annex C 
for further discussion on relationship of this document to the 
Directive. It provides basic authentication and integrity protection 
and can be created without accessing on-line (timestamping) services. 
However, without the addition of a timestamp or a secure time record 
the electronic signature does not protect against the threat that the 
signer later denies having created the electronic signature (i.e. does 
not provide non-repudiation of its existence). 

The ES-T time-stamp or time record should be created close to the time 
that ES was created to provide protection against repudiation. At this 
time all the data needed to complete the validation may not be 
available but what information is readily available may be used to 
carry out some of the initial checks. For example, only part of the 
revocation information may be available for verification at that point 
in time. Generally, the ES-C form cannot be created at the same time as 
the ES, as it is necessary to allow time for any revocation information 
to be captured. Also, if a certificate is found to be temporarily 
suspended, it will be necessary to wait until the end of the suspension 
period.

The signer should only create the ES-C in situations where it was 
prepared to wait for a sufficient length of time after creating the ES 
form before dispatching the ES-C. This, however, has the advantage that 
the verifier can be presented with the complete set of data supporting 
the validity of the ES.

Support for ES-C by the verifier is mandated (see clause 6 for 
specific conformance requirements).

An Electronic Signature (ES), with the additional validation data 
forming the ES-T and ES-C is illustrated in Figure 1:

+---------------------------------------------------------------------+



Figure 1: Illustration of an ES, ES-T and ES-C

The verifiers conformance requirements of an ES with a timestamp of the 
digital signature is defined in subclause 6.2.

The ES on its own satisfies the legal requirements for electronic 
signatures as defined in the European Directive on electronic 
signatures. The signers conformance requirements of an ES are defined 
in subclause 6.1, and are met using a structure as indicated in figure 
2:


+------Elect.Signature (ES)-----------|

||         | |Attributes| |         | | 
|+---------+ +----------+ +---------+ |
|+-----------------------------------+|



Figure 2: Illustration of an ES

Where there are requirements for long term signatures without 
timestamping the digital signature, then a secure record is needed of 
the time of verification in association with the electronic signature 
(i.e. both must be securely recorded).  In addition the certificates 
and revocation information used at the time of verification should to 
be recorded as indicated in figure 3 as an ES-C(bis).

+----------------------------------------------------------------+

Figure 3: Illustration of an ES-C(bis)

The verifiers conformance requirements of an ES-C(bis) is defined in 
subclause 6.3.

Note: A timestamp attached to the electronic signature or a secure time 
record helps to protect the validity of the signature even if some of 
the verification data associated with the signature become compromised 
AFTER the signature was generated. The timestamp or a secure time 
record provides evidence that the signature was generated BEFORE the 
event of compromise; hence the signature will maintain its validity 
status.

2.6  Extended Forms of Validation Data

The complete validation data (ES-C) described above may be extended to 
form an ES with eXtended validation data (ES-X) to meet following 
additional requirements.

Firstly, when the verifier does not has access to, 

     * the signer's certificate, 
     * all the CA certificates that make up the full certification 
       path,
     * all the associated revocation status information, as referenced 
       in the ES-C. 

then the values of these certificates and revocation information may be 
added to the ES-C. This form of extended validation data is called a 
X-Long.

Secondly, if there is a risk that any CA keys used in the certificate 
chain may be compromised, then it is necessary to additionally 
timestamp the validation data by either:

     * timestamping all the validation data as held with the ES(ES-C),
       this eXtended validation data is called a Type 1 X-Timestamp; or 
     * timestamping individual reference data as used for complete 
       validation. 



ETSI TC-SEC, Pinkas, Ross, Pope       Informational RFC       [Page 10]
Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats

This form of eXtended validation data is called a Type 2 X-Timestamp.

NOTE:  The advantages/drawbacks for Type 1 and Type 2 X-Timestamp are 
discussed in this document (see clause B.4.6.)


If all the above conditions occur then a combination of the two formats 
above may be used. This form of eXtended validation data is called 
a X-Long-Timestamped.

Support for the extended forms of validation data is optional.

An Electronic Signature (ES) , with the additional validation data 
forming the ES-X long is illustrated in Figure 4:

2.7  Archive Validation Data

Before the algorithms, keys and other cryptographic data used at the 
time the ES-C was built become weak and the cryptographic functions 
become vulnerable, or the certificates supporting previous timestamps 
expires, the signed data, the ES-C and any additional information 
(ES-X) should be timestamped.  If possible this should use stronger 
algorithms (or longer key lengths) than in the original timestamp.  

This additional data and timestamp is called Archive Validation Data
(ES-A).  The Timestamping process may be repeated every time the 
protection used to timestamp a previous ES-A become weak. An ES-A 
may thus bear multiple embedded time stamps.

An example of an Electronic Signature (ES), with the additional 
validation data for the ES-C and ES-X forming the ES-A is illustrated 
in Figure 7.

+-------------------------------- ES-A --------- ----------+ 
|  +-------------------- ES-A -----------------+           | 
|  |  +--------- ES-X -------------- +         |           |

|  +-------------------------------------------+           | 
+----------------------------------------------------------+

Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats


2.8  Arbitration

The ES-C may be used for arbitration should there be a dispute between 
the signer and verifier, provided that:

      * a copy of the signature policy referenced by the signer is 
        available;

      * the arbitrator knows where to retrieve the signer's certificate 
        (if not already present), all the cross-certificates and the 
        required CRLs and/or OCSPs responses referenced in the ES-C;

      * none of the issuing key from the certificate chain have ever 
        been compromised;

      * the cryptography used at the time the ES-C was built has not 
        been broken at the time the arbitration is performed.

When the second condition is not met, then the plaintiff must provide 
an ES-X Long.

When it is known by some external means that the third condition is 
not met, then the plaintiff must provide an ES-X Timestamped.

When the two previous conditions are not met, the plaintiff must 
provide the two above information (i.e. an ES-X Timestamped and Long).

When the last condition is not met, the plaintiff must provide an 
ES-A. 

It should be noticed that a verifier may need to get two time stamps 
at two different instants of time: one soon after the generation of 
the ES and one soon after some grace period allowing any entity from 
the certification chain to declare a key compromise.

2.9  Validation Process

The Validation Process validates an electronic signature in accordance 
with the requirements of the signature policy. The output status of 
the validation process can be:

     * valid;
     * invalid;
     * incomplete verification.

A Valid response indicates that the signature has passed verification 
and it complies with the signature validation policy.

A signature validation policy is a part of the signature policy which 
specifies the technical requirements on the signer in creating a 
signature and verifier when validating a signature.



ETSI TC-SEC, Pinkas, Ross, Pope       Informational RFC       [Page 13]
Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats


An Invalid response indicates that either the signature format is 
incorrect or that the digital signature value fails verification 
(e.g. the integrity checks on the digital signature value fails or 
any of the certificates on which the digital signature verification 
depends is known to be invalid or revoked).

An Incomplete Validation response indicates that the format and 
digital signature verifications have not failed but there is 
insufficient information to determine if the electronic signature 
is valid under the signature policy. This can include situations 
where additional information, which does not effect the validity of 
the digital signature value, may be available but is invalid. 

In the case of Incomplete Validation, it may be possible to request 
that the electronic signature be checked again at a later date when 
additional validation information might become available. Also, in the 
case of incomplete validation, additional information may be made 
available to the application or user, thus allowing the application or 
user to decide what to do with partially correct electronic signatures.

The validation process may also output validation data :

     * a signature timestamp;
     * the complete validation data;
     * the archive validation data.

2.10  Example Validation Sequence

Figure 8, and subsequent description, describes how the validation 
process may build up a complete electronic signature over time.

Soon after receiving the electronic signature (ES) from the signer (1), 
the digital signature value may be checked,  the validation process 
must at least add a time-stamp (2), unless the signer has provided one 
which is trusted by the verifier. The validation process may also 
validate the electronic signature, as required under the identified 
signature policy, using additional data (e.g. certificates, CRL, etc.) 
provided by trusted service providers. If the validation process is not 
complete then the output from this stage is the ES-T.

When all the additional data (e.g. the complete certificate and 
revocation information) necessary to validate the electronic signature 
first becomes available, then the validation process:

     * obtains all the necessary additional certificate and revocation 
       status information;

     * completes all the validation checks on the ES, using the 
       complete certificate and revocation information  (if a timestamp 
       is not already present, this may be added at the same stage 
       combining ES-T and ES-C process);



ETSI TC-SEC, Pinkas, Ross, Pope       Informational RFC       [Page 14]
Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats


     * records the complete certificate and revocation references (3);

     * indicates the validity status to the user (4).

At the same time as the validation process creates the ES-C, the 
validation process may provide and/or record the values of certificates 
and revocation status information used in ES-C, called the ES-X Long 
(5). This is illustrated in figure 9:

When the validation process creates the ES-C it may also create 
extended forms of validation data. A first alternative is to timestamp 
all data forming the Type 1 X-Timestamp (6). This is illustrated in

Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats

Before the algorithms used in any of electronic signatures become or 
are likely, to be compromised or rendered vulnerable in the future, it 
is necessary to timestamp the entire electronic signature, including 
all the values of the validation and user data as an ES with Archive 
validation data (ES-A) 

  An ES-A is illustrated in figure 12:

2.11  Additional optional features of an ES

This document also defines additional optional features of
an electronic signature to:

     * indicate a commitment type being made by the signer;
     * indicate the role under which a signature was created;
     * support multiple signatures.

ETSI TC-SEC, Pinkas, Ross, Pope       Informational RFC       [Page 19]
Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats


3. Data structure of an Electronic Signature

This clause uses and builds upon the Cryptographic Message Syntax 
(CMS), as defined in RFC 2630 [CMS], and Enhanced Security Services 
(ESS), as defined in RFC 2634 [ESS]. The overall structure 
of Electronic Signature is as defined in [CMS]. The Electronic 
Signature (ES) uses attributes defined in [CMS], [ESS] and 
this document. This document defines in full the ES attributes which it 
uses and are not defined elsewhere.

The mandated set of attributes and the digital signature value is 
defined as the minimum Electronic Signature (ES) required by this 
document. A signature policy MAY mandate other signed attributes to be
present.

3.1  General Syntax

The general syntax of the ES is as defined in [CMS].

3.2  Data Content Type 

The data content type of the ES is as defined in [CMS].

The data content type is intended to refer to arbitrary octet strings, 
such as ASCII text files; the interpretation is left to the 
application.  Such strings need not have any internal structure 
(although they could have their own ASN.1 definition or other 
structure).

3.3  Signed-data Content Type

The Signed-data content type of the ES is as defined in [CMS].

The signed-data content type consists of a content of any type and zero 
or more signature values. Any number of signers in parallel can sign 
any type of content. The typical application of the signed-data content 
type represents one signer's digital signature on content of the data 
content type.

To make sure that the verifier uses the right certificate, this 
document mandates that the hash of the signers certificate is always 
included in the Signing Certificate signed attribute.

3.4  SignedData Type

The syntax of the SignedData type of the ES is as defined in [CMS].

The fields of type SignedData have the meanings defined [CMS] except 
that:

     * version is the syntax version number. The value of version must 
       be 3.


ETSI TC-SEC, Pinkas, Ross, Pope       Informational RFC       [Page 20]
Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats

     * The identification of signer's certificate used to create the 
       signature is always present as a signed attribute.

     * The degenerate case where there are no signers is not valid in 
       this document.

3.5  EncapsulatedContentInfo Type

The syntax of the EncapsulatedContentInfo a type of the ES is as 
defined in [CMS].

For the purpose of long term validation as defined by this document, it 
is advisable that either the eContent is present, or the data which is 
signed is archived in such as way as to preserve the any data encoding. 
It is important that the OCTET STRING used to generate the signature 
remains the same every time either the verifier or an arbitrator 
validates the signature.

The degenerate case where there are no signers is not valid in this 
document.

3.6  SignerInfo Type

The syntax of the SignerInfo a type of the ES is as defined in [CMS].

Per-signer information is represented in the type SignerInfo. In the 
case of multiple independent signatures, there is an instance 
of this field for each signer.

The fields of type SignerInfo have the meanings defined in [CMS] 
except that signedAttributes must, as a minimum, contain the following 
attributes:

* ContentType as defined in clause 3.7.1.
* MessageDigest as defined in clause 3.7.2.
* SigningTime as defined in clause 3.7.3.
* SigningCertificate as defined in clause 3.8.1.
* SignaturePolicyId as defined in clause 3.9.1.

3.6.1  Message Digest Calculation Process

The message digest calculation process is as defined in [CMS]. 

3.6.2  Message Signature Generation Process

The input to the digital signature generation process is as defined in 
[CMS]. 

3.6.3  Message Signature Verification Process

The procedures for CMS signed data validation are as defined in 
[CMS] and enhanced in this document.



ETSI TC-SEC, Pinkas, Ross, Pope       Informational RFC       [Page 21]
Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats

The input to the signature verification process includes the signer's 
public key verified as correct using either the ESS Signing 
Certificate attribute or the Other Signing Certificate attribute. 

3.7  CMS Imported Mandatory Present Attributes

The following attributes MUST be present with the signed-data defined 
by this document. The attributes are defined in [CMS].

3.7.1  Content Type

The syntax of the content-type attribute type of the ES is as defined 
in [CMS].

3.7.2  Message Digest

The syntax of the message-digest attribute type of the ES is as defined 
in [CMS].

3.7.3  Signing Time

The syntax of the message-digest attribute type of the ES is as defined 
in [CMS] and further qualified by this document.

The signing-time attribute type specifies the time at which the signer 
claims to have performed the signing process. 

This present document recommends the use of GeneralizedTime.

3.8  Alternative Signing Certificate Attributes

One, and only one, of the following two alternative attributes MUST be 
present with the signed-data defined by this document to identify the 
signing certificate. Both attributes include an identifier and a hash 
of the signing certificate. The first, which is adopted in existing 
standards, may be only used with the SHA-1 hashing algorithm. The 
other shall be used when other hashing algorithms are to be supported.

The signing certificate attribute is designed to prevent the simple 
substitution and re-issue attacks, and to allow for a restricted set of 
authorization certificates to be used in verifying a signature.

3.8.1  ESS Signing Certificate Attribute Definition

The syntax of the signing certificate attribute type of the ES is as 
defined in [ESS], and further qualified and profile in this document.

The ESS signing certificate attribute must be a signed attribute.

This document mandates the presence of this attribute as a signed CMS 
attribute, and the sequence must not be empty. The certificate used to 
verify the signature must be identified in the sequence, the Signature 
Validation Policy may mandate other certificate references to be 
present, that may include all the certificates up to the point of 

ETSI TC-SEC, Pinkas, Ross, Pope       Informational RFC       [Page 22]
Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats

trust. The encoding of the ESSCertID for this certificate must include 
the issuerSerial field. 

The issuerAndSerialNumber present in the SignerInfo must be 
consistent with issuerSerial field. The certificate identified must be 
used during the signature verification process. If the hash of the 
certificate does not match the certificate used to verify the 
signature, the signature must be considered invalid.

The sequence of policy information field is not used in this document.

NOTE: Where an attribute certificate is used by the signer to associate 
a role, or other attributes of the signer, with the electronic 
signature this is placed in the Signer Attribute attribute as defined 
in clause 3.12.3.

3.8.2  Other Signing Certificate Attribute Definition

The following attribute is identical to the ESS SigningCertificate 
defined above except that this attribute can be used with hashing 
algorithms other than SHA-1.

This attribute must be used in the same manner as defined above for 
the ESS SigningCertificate attribute.

The following object identifier identifies the signing certificate 
attribute:

id-aa-ets-otherSigCert OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1)
    member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs9(9)
    smime(16) id-aa(2) 19 }

The signing certificate attribute value has the ASN.1 syntax 
OtherSigningCertificate

OtherSigningCertificate ::=  SEQUENCE {
    certs        SEQUENCE OF OtherCertID,
    policies     SEQUENCE OF PolicyInformation OPTIONAL
                 -- NOT USED IN THIS DOCUMENT
}

OtherCertID ::= SEQUENCE {
     otherCertHash            OtherHash,
     issuerSerial             IssuerSerial OPTIONAL
}

OtherHash ::= CHOICE {
    sha1Hash OtherHashValue,  -- This contains a SHA-1 hash
    otherHash OtherHashAlgAndValue
}

OtherHashValue ::= OCTET STRING

OtherHashAlgAndValue ::= SEQUENCE {
  hashAlgorithm  AlgorithmIdentifier,
  hashValue      OtherHashValue
}



3.9  Additional Mandatory Attributes 

3.9.1  Signature policy Identifier

This document mandates that a reference to the signature policy, is 
included in the signedData, this reference is either explicitly 
identified or implied by the semantics of the signed content and other 
external data.  A signature policy defines the rules for creation and 
validation of an electronic signature, is included as a signed 
attribute with every signature. The signature policy identifier must be 
a signed attribute.

The following object identifier identifies the signature policy 
identifier attribute:

id-aa-ets-sigPolicyId OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1)
    member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs9(9)
    smime(16) id-aa(2) 15 }

Signature-policy-identifier attribute values have ASN.1 type 
SignaturePolicyIdentifier.

SignaturePolicyIdentifier ::= CHOICE{
         SignaturePolicyId          SignaturePolicyId,
         SignaturePolicyImplied     SignaturePolicyImplied }


SignaturePolicyId ::= SEQUENCE {
        sigPolicyIdentifier   SigPolicyId,
        sigPolicyHash         SigPolicyHash,
        sigPolicyQualifiers   SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF
                              SigPolicyQualifierInfo      OPTIONAL
										}

SignaturePolicyImplied ::= NULL
 
The presence of the NULL type indicates that the signature policy is 
implied by the semantics of the signed data and other external data.







ETSI TC-SEC, Pinkas, Ross, Pope       Informational RFC       [Page 24]
Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats

The sigPolicyId field contains an object-identifier which 
uniquely identifies a specific version of the signature policy. The 
syntax of this field is as follows:

   SigPolicyId ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER

The sigPolicyHash field contains the identifier of the hash algorithm 
and the hash of the value of the signature policy.

If the signature policy is defined using a computer processable 
notation like ASN.1, then the hash is calculated on the value without 
the outer type and length fields and the hashing algorithm must be as 
specified in the field signPolicyHshAlg.

If the signature policy is defined using another structure, the type of 
structure and the hashing algorithm must be either specified as part 
of the signature policy, or indicated using a signature policy 
qualifier. 

   SigPolicyHash ::= ETSIHashAlgAndValue

A signature policy identifier may be qualified with other information 
about the qualifier. The semantics and syntax of the qualifier is as 
associated with the object-identifier in the sigPolicyQualifierId 
field. The general syntax of this qualifier is as follows:

   SigPolicyQualifierInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
        sigPolicyQualifierId  SigPolicyQualifierId,
        sigQualifier          ANY DEFINED BY sigPolicyQualifierId
}

This document specifies the following qualifiers:

    * spuri: This contains the web URI or URL reference to the 
      signature policy

    * spUserNotice: This contains a user notice which should be 
      displayed whenever the signature is validated.

3.10  CMS Imported Optional Attributes

The following attributes MAY be present with the signed-data defined by 
this document. The attributes are defined in ref [CMS] and are imported

into this specification and were appropriate qualified and profiling by 
this document.

3.10.1  Countersignature

The syntax of the countersignature attribute type of the ES is as 
defined in [CMS]. The countersignature attribute must be an unsigned 
attribute.

3.11  ESS Imported Optional Attributes

The following attributes MAY be present with the signed-data defined by 
this document. The attributes are defined in ref [ESS] and are imported 
into this specification and were appropriate qualified and profiling 
by this document.



ETSI TC-SEC, Pinkas, Ross, Pope       Informational RFC       [Page 26]
Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats




3.11.1 Content Reference Attribute 

The content reference attribute is a link from one SignedData to 
another. It may be used to link a reply to the original message to 
which it refers, or to incorporate by reference one SignedData into 
another. 

The content reference attribute MUST be used as defined in [ESS].  The 
content reference MUST be a signed attribute.

The syntax of the content reference attribute type of the ES is as 
defined in [ESS].

3.11.2  Content Identifier Attribute 

The content identifier attribute provides an identifier for the signed 
content for use when reference may be later required to that content, 
for example in the content reference attribute in other signed data 
sent later.

The content identifier must be a signed attribute.

The syntax of the content identifier attribute type of the ES is as 
defined in [ESS].

The minimal signedContentIdentifier should contain a concatenation of 
user-specific identification information (such as a user name or public 
keying material identification information), a GeneralizedTime string, 
and a random number.

3.11.3	Content Hints Attribute 

The content hints attribute provides information that describes the 
format of the signed content. It may be used by the signer to indicate 
to a verifier the precise format that MUST be used to present the data 
(e.g. text, voice, video) to a verifier.  This attribute MUST be 
present when it is mandatory to present the signed data to human users 
on verification.

The syntax of the content hints attribute type of the ES is as defined 
in ESS (RFC 2634, section 2.9 [9]).

When used to indicate the precise format of the data to be presented to 
the user the following rules apply:

The contentType (defined in RFC 2630 [8]) indicates the type of the 
associated content. It is an object identifier (i.e. a unique string of 
integers) assigned by an authority that defines the content type.




ETSI TC-SEC, Pinkas, Ross, Pope       Informational RFC       [Page 27]
Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats 
 
The UTF8String shall define the presentation format. The format may be 
defined by MIME types as indicated below. 


Note 1: The contentType can be id-data defined in CMS (RFC 2630 [8]). 
The UTF8String can be used to indicate the encoding of the data, like 
MIME type. RFC 2045 [25] provides a common structure for encoding a 
range of electronic documents and other multi-media types, see annex B 
for further information, a system supporting verification of electronic 
signature may present information to users in the form identified by 
the MIME type.


id-data OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) 
rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs7(7) 1 }


3.12   Additional Optional Attributes 

3.12.1  Commitment Type Indication Attribute

There may be situation were a signer wants to explicitly indicate to a 
verifier that by signing the data, it illustrates a type of commitment 
on behalf of the signer. The commitmentTypeIndication attribute conveys 
such information.



The commitmentTypeIndication attribute must be a signed attribute.

The commitment type may be:

    * defined as part of the signature policy, in which case the 
      commitment type has precise semantics that is defined as part of 
      the signature policy. 

    * be a registered type, in which case the commitment type has 
      precise semantics defined by registration, under the rules of the
      registration authority. Such a registration authority may be a
      trading association or a legislative authority.

The signature policy specifies a set of attributes that it 
"recognizes". This "recognized" set includes all those commitment types 
defined as part of the signature policy as well as any externally 
defined commitment types that the policy may choose to recognize. Only

These generic commitment types have the following meaning: 

Proof of origin indicates that the signer recognizes to have created, 
approved and sent the message.

Proof of receipt indicates that signer recognizes to have received the 
content of the message.

Proof of delivery indicates that the TSP providing that indication has 
delivered a message in a local store accessible to the recipient of the 
message.

(but not necessarily approved, nor sent it).

3.12.2  Signer Location attribute

The signer-location attribute is an attribute which specifies a 
mnemonic for an address associated with the signer at a particular 
geographical (e.g. city) location. The mnemonic is registered in the 
country in which the signer is located and is used in the provision of 
the Public Telegram Service (according to ITU-T Recommendation F.1
[PTS]).

The signer-location attribute must be a signed attribute.

3.12.3  Signer Attributes attribute

The signer-attributes attribute is an attribute which specifies 
additional attributes of the signer (e.g. role). 

It may be either:

     * claimed attributes of the signer; or
     * certified attributes of the signer;

The signer-attributes attribute must be a signed attribute.

The following object identifier identifies the signer-attribute 
attribute:

id-aa-ets-signerAttr OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2)
    us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs-9(9) smime(16) id-aa(2) 18}

Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats



The value of messageImprint field within TimeStampToken must be a hash 
of the value of eContent field within encapContentInfo within the 
signedData.

For further information and definition of TimeStampToken see [TSP].


3.13  Support for Multiple Signatures

3.13.1  Independent Signatures

Multiple independent signatures are supported by independent SignerInfo 
from each signer.

Each SignerInfo must include all the attributes required under this 
document and must be processed independently by the verifier.

3.13.2  Embedded Signatures

Multiple embedded signatures are supported using the counter-signature 
unsigned attribute (see clause 3.10.1). Each counter signature is 
carried in Countersignature held as an unsigned attribute to the 
SignerInfo to which the counter-signature is applied.

4.  Validation Data

This clause specifies the validation data structures which builds on 
the electronic signature specified in clause 3. This includes:

    * Timestamp applied to the electronic signature value.

    * Complete validation data which comprises the timestamp of the 
      signature value, plus references to all the certificates and 
      revocation information used for full validation of the electronic 
      signature.

The following optional eXtended forms of validation data are also 
defined:

     * X-timestamp: There are two types of timestamp used in extended 
       validation data defined by this document.

        - Type 1 -Timestamp which comprises a timestamp over the ES
          with Complete validation data (ES-C).


        - Type 2 X-Timestamp which comprises of a timestamp over the 
          certification path references and the revocation information 
          references used to support the ES-C.




ETSI TC-SEC, Pinkas, Ross, Pope       Informational RFC       [Page 32]
Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats




               * X-Long : This comprises a  Complete validation data 
                 plus the actual values of all the certificates and 
                 revocation information used in the ES-C.

               * X-Long-Timestamp: This comprises a Type 1 or Type 2 
                 X-Timestamp plus the actual values of all the 
                 certificates and revocation information used in the
                 ES-C.

This clause also specifies the data structures used in Archive 
validation data: 

      * Archive validation data comprises a  Complete validation data,
        the certificate and revocation values (as in a X-Long 
        validation data), any other existing X-timestamps, plus the
        Signed User data and an additional archive timestamp over all 
        that data. An archive timestamp may be repeatedly applied 
        after long periods to maintain validity when electronic 
        signature and timestamping algorithms weaken.

The additional data required to create the forms of electronic 
signature identified above is carried as unsigned attributes 
associated with an individual signature by being placed in the 
unsignedAttrs field of SignerInfo. Thus all the attributes defined 
in clause 4 are unsigned attributes.

NOTE:  Where multiple signatures are to be supported, as described in 
clause 3.13, each signature has a separate SignerInfo. Thus, each 
signature requires its own unsigned attribute values to create ES-T, 
ES-C etc.

4.1  Electronic Signature Timestamp 

An Electronic Signature with Timestamp is an Electronic Signature for 
which part, but not all, of the additional data required for validation 
is available (e.g. some certificates and revocation information is 
available but not all). 

The minimum structure Timestamp validation data is the Signature 
Timestamp Attribute as defined in clause 4.1.1 over the ES signature 
value.

4.1.1  Signature Timestamp Attribute Definition

The Signature Timestamp attribute is timestamp of the signature value. 
It is an unsigned attribute. Several instances of this attribute from 
different TSAs may occur with an electronic signature.





ETSI TC-SEC, Pinkas, Ross, Pope       Informational RFC       [Page 33]
Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats

The Signature Validation Policy specifies, in the 
signatureTimestampDelay field of TimestampTrustConditions, a maximum 
acceptable time difference which is allowed between the time indicated 
in the signing time attribute and the time indicated by the Signature 
Timestamp attribute. If this delay is exceeded then the electronic 
signature must be considered as invalid.

The following object identifier identifies the Signature Timestamp 
attribute:

     id-aa-signatureTimeStampToken OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1)
     member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs-9(9) smime(16)
     id-aa(2) 14}

The Signature timestamp attribute value has ASN.1 type 
SignatureTimeStampToken.

SignatureTimeStampToken ::= TimeStampToken

The value of messageImprint field within TimeStampToken must be a hash 
of the value of signature field within SignerInfo for the signedData 
being timestamped.

For further information and definition of TimeStampToken see [TSP]

4.2  Complete Validation Data 

An electronic signature with complete validation data is an Electronic 
Signature for which all the additional data required for validation 
(i.e. all certificates and revocation information) is available.  
Complete validation data (ES-C) build on the electronic signature 
Timestamp as defined above.

The minimum structure of a Complete validation data is:

     * the Signature Timestamp Attribute, as defined in clause 4.1.1;
     * Complete Certificate Refs, as defined in clause 4.2.1;
     * Complete Revocation Refs, as defined in clause 4.2.2.

The Complete validation data MAY also include the following additional 
information, forming a X-Long validation data, for use if later 
validation processes may not have access to this information:

     * Complete Certificate Values, as defined in clause 4.2.3;
     * Complete Revocation Values, as defined in clause 4.2.4.

The  Complete validation data MAY also include one of the following 
additional attributes, forming a X-Timestamp validation data, to 
provide additional protection against later CA compromise and provide 
integrity of the validation data used:

     * ES-C Timestamp, as defined in clause 4.2.5; or
     * Time-Stamped Certificates and CRLs references, as defined in 
       clause 4.2.6.

ETSI TC-SEC, Pinkas, Ross, Pope       Informational RFC       [Page 34]
Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats

NOTE 1: As long as the CA's are trusted such that these keys cannot 
be compromised or the cryptography used broken, the ES-C provides long 
term proof of a valid electronic signature.

A valid electronic signature is an electronic signature which passes 
validation according to a signature validation policy.

NOTE 2: The ES-C provides the following important property for long 
standing signatures; that is having been found once to be valid, must 
continue to be so months or years later. Long after the validity period 
of the certificates have expired, or after the user key has been 
compromised.

4.2.1  Complete Certificate Refs Attribute Definition

The Complete Certificate Refs attribute is an unsigned attribute. It 
references the full set of CA certificates that have been used to 
validate a ES with Complete validation data (ES-C) up to (but not 
including) the signer's certificate. Only a single instance of this 
attribute must occur with an electronic signature.

Note: The signer's certified is referenced in the signing certificate 
attribute (see clause 3.1).

id-aa-ets-certificateRefs OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2)
    us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs-9(9) smime(16) id-aa(2) 21}

CompleteCertificateRefs.

CompleteCertificateRefs ::=  SEQUENCE OF OTHERCertID

OTHERCertID is defined in clause 3.8.2. 

The IssuerSerial that must be present in OTHERCertID. The certHash 
must match the hash of the certificate referenced.

NOTE:  Copies of the certificate values may be held using the 
Certificate Values attribute defined in clause 4.3.1.

4.2.2  Complete Revocation Refs Attribute Definition

The Complete Revocation Refs attribute is an unsigned attribute. Only a 
single instance of this attribute must occur with an electronic 
signature. It references the full set of the CRL or OCSP responses that 
have been used in the validation of the signer and CA certificates 
used in ES with Complete validation data.

The following object identifier identifies the CompleteRevocationRefs 
attribute:

id-aa-ets-revocationRefs OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2)
    us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs-9(9) smime(16) id-aa(2) 22}


ETSI TC-SEC, Pinkas, Ross, Pope       Informational RFC       [Page 35]
Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats

CrlOcspRef ::= SEQUENCE {
    crlids           [0] CRLListID        OPTIONAL,
    ocspids          [1] OcspListID       OPTIONAL,
    otherRev         [2] OtherRevRefs     OPTIONAL
}

CompleteRevocationRefs must contain one CrlOcspRef for the signing 
certificate, followed by one for each OTHERCertID in the 
CompleteCertificateRefs attribute. The second and subsequent CrlOcspRef 
fields must be in the same order as the OTHERCertID to which they 
relate. At least one of CRLListID or OcspListID or OtherRevRefs should 
be present for all but the "trusted" CA of the certificate path.

CRLListID ::=  SEQUENCE {
    crls        SEQUENCE OF CrlValidatedID}

CrlValidatedID ::=  SEQUENCE {
     crlHash                   ETSIHash, 
     crlIdentifier             CrlIdentifier OPTIONAL}

    crlissuer                 Name,
    crlIssuedTime             UTCTime,
    crlNumber                 INTEGER OPTIONAL
                                            }

OcspListID ::=  SEQUENCE {
    ocspResponses        SEQUENCE OF OcspResponsesID}

OcspResponsesID ::=  SEQUENCE {
    ocspIdentifier              OcspIdentifier,

OcspIdentifier ::= SEQUENCE {
     ocspResponderID    ResponderID,  
                       -- As in OCSP response data
     producedAt      GeneralizedTime 
                       -- As in OCSP response data
                                             }

When creating an crlValidatedID, the crlHash is computed over the 
entire DER encoded CRL including the signature. The crlIdentifier would 
normally be present unless the CRL can be inferred from other 
information.




ETSI TC-SEC, Pinkas, Ross, Pope       Informational RFC       [Page 36]
Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats

The crlIdentifier is to identify the CRL using the issuer name and the 
CRL issued time which must correspond to the time "thisUpdate" 
contained in the issued CRL. The crlListID attribute is an unsigned 
attribute. In the case that the identified CRL is a Delta CRL then 
references to the set of CRLs to provide a complete revocation list 
must be included.

The OcspIdentifier is to identify the OSCP response using the issuer 
name and the time of issue of the OCSP response which must correspond 
to the time "producedAt" contained in the issued OCSP response. Since 
it may be needed to make the difference between two OCSP responses 
received within the same second, then the hash of the response 
contained in the OcspResponsesID may be needed to solve the ambiguity.

NOTE: Copies of the CRL and OCSP responses values may be held using 
the Revocation Values attribute defined in clause 4.3.2.

OtherRevRefs ::= SEQUENCE {
   otherRevRefType      OtherRevRefType,
   otherRevRefs         ANY DEFINED BY otherRevRefType
}

OtherRevRefType ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER

The syntax and semantics of other revocation references is outside the 
scope of this document.  The definition of the syntax of the other form 
of revocation information is as identified by OtherRevRefType.

4.4  Archive Validation Data

Where an electronic signature is required to last for a very long time, 
and a the timestamp on an electronic signature is in danger of being 
invalidated due to algorithm weakness or limits in the validity period 
of the TSA certificate, then it may be required to timestamp the

electronic signature several times. When this is required an archive 
timestamp attribute may be required. This timestamp may be repeatedly 
applied over a period of time.

4.4.1  Archive Timestamp Attribute Definition

The Archive Timestamp attribute is timestamp of the user data and the 
entire electronic signature. If the Certificate values and Revocation 
Values attributes are not present these attributes must be added to 
the electronic signature prior to the timestamp. The Archive Timestamp 
attribute is an unsigned attribute. Several instances of this attribute 
may occur with on electronic signature both over time and from 
different TSAs.

The timestamp should be created using stronger algorithms (or longer 
key lengths) than in the original electronic signatures.

5.  Security considerations

5.1  Protection of Private Key

The security of the electronic signature mechanism defined in this 
document depends on the privacy of the signer's private key.  
Implementations must take steps to ensure that private keys cannot be 
compromised.

5.2  Choice of Algorithms

Implementers should be aware that cryptographic algorithms become 
weaker with time. As new cryptoanalysis techniques are developed and 
computing performance improves, the work factor to break a particular 
cryptographic algorithm will reduce. Therefore, cryptographic algorithm 
implementations should be modular allowing new algorithms to be readily 
inserted. That is, implementers should be prepared for the set of 
mandatory to implement algorithms to change over time.

6.  Conformance Requirements

This document only defines conformance requirements up to a ES with 
Complete validation data (ES-C). This means that none of the extended 
and archive forms of Electronic Signature (ES-X, ES-A) need to be 
implemented to get conformance to this standard.

This document mandates support for elements of the signature policy.

6.1  Signer

A system supporting signers according to this document must, at a 
minimum, support generation of an electronic signature consisting of 
the following components:

      * The general CMS syntax and content type as defined in RFC 2630 
        (see clauses 4.1 and 4.2).

      * CMS SignedData as defined in RFC 2630 with version set to 3 
        and at least one SignerInfo must be present 
        (see clauses 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6).

      * The following CMS Attributes as defined in RFC 2630 :

             - ContentType; This must always be present 
               (see clause 3.7.1);

             - MessageDigest; This must always be present 
               (see clause 3.7.2);

             - SigningTime; This must always be present 
               (see clause 3.7.3).


ETSI TC-SEC, Pinkas, Ross, Pope       Informational RFC       [Page 41]
Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats

      * The following ESS Attributes as defined in RFC 2634 :

              - SigningCertificate: This must be set as defined 
                in clauses 3.8.1 and 3.8.2.

      * The following Attributes as defined in clause 3.9:
             - SignaturePolicyIdentifier; This must always be present.

      * Public Key Certificates as defined in ITU-T Recommendation 
        X.509 [1] and profiled in RFC 2459 [7] (see clause 9.1).

6.2  Verifier using timestamping 

A system supporting verifiers according to this document with 
timestamping facilities must, at a minimum, support:

       * Verification of the mandated components of an electronic 
         signature, as defined in clause 5.1.

       * Signature Timestamp attribute, as defined in clause 4.1.1.

       * Complete Certificate Refs attribute, as defined in 
         clause 4.2.1.

       * Complete Revocation Refs Attribute, as defined in 
         clause  4.2.2.

       * Public Key Certificates, as defined in ITU-T 
         Recommendation X.509 and profiled in RFC 2459.

       * Either of:

             - Certificate Revocation Lists. as defined in ITU-T 
               Recommendation X.509 [1] and profiled in RFC 2459 [7]; 
               or

             - On-line Certificate Status Protocol responses, as 
               defined in RFC 2560.

6.3	Verifier using secure records

A system supporting verifiers according to the present document shall, 
at a minimum, support:

       * Verification of the mandated components of an electronic
         signature, as defined in subclause 5.1.

       * Complete Certificate Refs attribute, as defined in 
          subclause 4.2.1.

Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats

       * Complete Revocation Refs Attribute, as defined in
         subclause 9.2.2.

       * A record shall be maintained, which cannot be undetectably
         modified, of the electronic signature and the time when the
         signature was first validated using the referenced 
         certificates and revocation information.
 
       * Public Key Certificates, as defined in ITU-T Recommendation
         X.509 [1] and profiled in RFC 2459 [7] (see subclause 10.1).

       * Either of:
             - Certificate Revocation Lists. as defined in ITU-T
               Recommendation X.509 [1] and profiled in RFC 2459 [7]
              Or

             - On-line Certificate Status Protocol, as defined 
               in RFC 2560 [8] (see subclause 10.3).

Annex B (informative): General Description

This annex captures the concepts that apply to this document and the 
rational for the elements of the specification defined using ASN.1 in 
the main text of this document.

The specification below includes a description why the component is 
needed, with a brief description of the vulnerabilities and threats 
and the manner by which they are countered. 

B.1  The Signature Policy

The signature policy is a set of rules for the creation and validation 
of an electronic signature, under which the signature can be 
determined to be valid. A given legal/contractual context may 
recognize a particular signature policy as meeting its requirements. 
A signature policy may be issued, for example, by a party relying on 
the electronic signatures and selected by the signer for use with that 
relying party. Alternatively, a signature policy may be established 
through an electronic trading association for use amongst its members. 
Both the signer and verifier use the same signature policy.

The signature policy may be explicitly identified or may be implied by 
the semantics of the data being signed and other external data like a 
contract being referenced which itself refers to a signature policy.

An explicit signature policy has a globally unique reference, which is 
bound to an electronic signature by the signer as part of the signature 
calculation.

The signature policy needs to be available in human readable form so 
that it can be assessed to meet the requirements of the legal and 
contractual context in which it is being applied. To facilitate the 
automatic processing of an electronic signature the parts of the 
signature policy which specify the electronic rules for the creation 
and validation of the electronic signature also needs to be in a 
computer processable form.

The signature policy thus includes the following:

     * Information about the signature policy that can be displayed 
       to the signer or the verifiers.
     * Rules, which apply to functionality, covered by this document 
       (referred to as the Signature Validation Policy).
     * Rules which may be implied through adoption of Certificate 
       Policies that apply to the electronic signature (e.g. rules for
       ensuring the secrecy of the private signing key).
     * Rules, which relate to the environment used by the signer,
       e.g. the use of an agreed CAD (Card Accepting Device) used 
       in conjunction with a smart card.

Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats

An explicit Signature Validation Policy may be structured so that it 
can be computer processable. Any format of the signature validation 
policy is allowed by this document. However, for a given explicit 
signature policy there must be one definitive form that has a unique 
binary encoded value.

The Signature Validation Policy includes rules regarding use of TSPs 
(CA, Attribute Authorities, Time Stamping Authorities) as well as 
rules defining the components of the electronic signature that must be 
provided by the signer with data required by the verifier to provide 
long term proof. 

B.2  Signed Information

The information being signed may be defined as a MIME-encapsulated 
message which can be used to signal the format of the content in order 
to select the right display or application. It can be composed of 
formatted text (e.g. EDIFACT), free text or of fields from an 
electronic form (e-form). For example, the Adobe(tm) format "pdf" may 
be used or the eXtensible Mark up Language (XML). 

B.3  Components of an Electronic Signature 

B.3.1  Reference to the Signature Policy

The definition of electronic signature includes: "a commitment has 
been explicitly endorsed under a "Signature policy", at a given time, 
by a signer under an identifier, e.g. a name or a pseudonym, and 
optionally a role". 

When two independent parties want to evaluate an electronic signature, 
it is fundamental that they get the same result. To meet this 
requirement same signature policy must be used by the signer and 
verifier.

The signature policy may be explicitly identified or may be implied by 
the semantics of the data being signed and other external data which 
designate the signature policy to be used.

By signing over the signature policy identifier the signer explicitly 
indicates that he or she has applied the signature policy in creating 
the signature. Thus, undertakes any explicit or implied commitments.

In order to unambiguously identify an explicit signature policy that is 
to be used to verify the signature an identifier and hash of the 
"Signature policy" shall be part of the signed data. Additional 
information about the explicit policy (e.g. web reference to the 
document) may be carried as "qualifiers" to the signature policy 
identifier.






ETSI TC-SEC, Pinkas, Ross, Pope       Informational RFC       [Page 65]
Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats

When the signature policy not explicitly identified, but is implied by 
the semantics of the data being signed, then the signature will include 
a signature policy identifier that indicates that the signature policy 
is implied. In this case the verification rules must be determined by 
using other external data which will designate the signature policy to 
be used. If it may be determined from the context that all the 
documents to be verified refer to the same signature policy, then that 
policy may be predetermined or fixed within the application.

In order to identify unambiguously the "Signature Validation Policy" 
to be used to verify the signature an identifier and hash of the 
"Signature policy" must be part of the signed data. Additional 
information about the policy (e.g. web reference to the document) may 
be carried as "qualifiers" to the signature policy identifier.

B.3.2  Commitment Type Indication

The definition of electronic signature includes: "a commitment has 
been explicitly endorsed under a signature policy, at a given time, 
by a signer under an identifier, e.g. a name or a pseudonym, and 
optionally a role". 

The commitment type can be indicated in the electronic signature 
either:

      * explicitly using a "commitment type indication" in the
        electronic signature;

      * implicitly or explicitly from the semantics of the signed data.

If the indicated commitment type is explicit using a "commitment type 
indication" in the electronic signature, acceptance of a verified 
signature implies acceptance of the semantics of that commitment type. 
The semantics of explicit commitment types indications must be 
specified either as part of the signature policy or may be registered 
for generic use across multiple policies.

If a signature includes a commitment type indication other than one of 
those recognized under the signature policy the signature must be 
treated as invalid.

How commitment is indicated using the semantics of the data being 
signed is outside the scope of this document.

NOTE:  Examples of commitment indicated through the semantics of the 
data being signed, are:

     * An explicit commitment made by the signer indicated by the type 
       of data being signed over. Thus, the data structure being 
       signed can have an explicit commitment within the context of 
       the application (e.g. EDIFACT purchase order).




ETSI TC-SEC, Pinkas, Ross, Pope       Informational RFC       [Page 66]
Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats

     * An implicit commitment which is a commitment made by the signer 
       because the data being signed over has specific semantics
       (meaning) which is only interpretable by humans, (i.e. free 
       text).


B.3.3  Certificate Identifier from the Signer

The definition of the ETSI electronic signature includes: "a 
commitment has been explicitly endorsed under a signature policy, 
at a given time, by a signer under an identifier, e.g. a name or a 
pseudonym, and optionally a role."

In many real life environments users will be able to get from 
different CAs or even from the same CA, different certificates 
containing the same public key for different names. The prime 
advantage is that a user can use the same private key for different 
purposes. Multiple use of the private key is an advantage when a smart 
card is used to protect the private key, since the storage of a smart 
card is always limited. When several CAs are involved, each different 
certificate may contain a different identity, e.g. as a national or as 
an employee from a company. Thus when a private key is used for 
various purposes, the certificate is needed to clarify the context in 
which the private key was used when generating the signature. Where 
there is the possibility of multiple use of private keys it is 
necessary for the signer to indicate to the verifier the precise 
certificate to be used.

Many current schemes simply add the certificate after the signed data 
and thus are subject to various substitution attacks. An example of a 
substitution attack is a "bad" CA that would issue a certificate to 
someone with the public key of someone else. If the certificate from 
the signer was simply appended to the signature and thus not protected 
by the signature, any one could substitute one certificate by another 
and the message would appear to be signed by some one else. 

In order to counter this kind of attack, the identifier of the signer 
has to be protected by the digital signature from the signer.

Although it does not provide the same advantages as the previous 
technique, another technique to counter that threat has been 
identified. It requires all CAs to perform a Proof Of Possession of 
the private key at the time of registration. The problem with that 
technique is that it does not provide any guarantee at the time of 
verification and only some proof "after the event" may be obtained, if 
and only if the CA keeps the Proof Of Possession in audit trail.

In order to identify unambiguously the certificate to be used for the 
verification of the signature an identifier of the certificate from 
the signer must be part of the signed data.





ETSI TC-SEC, Pinkas, Ross, Pope       Informational RFC       [Page 67]
Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats

B.3.4  Role Attributes

The definition of electronic signature includes: "a commitment has 
been explicitly endorsed under a non repudiation security policy, 
at a given time, by a signer under an identifier, e.g. a name or a 
pseudonym, and optionally a role. "

While the name of the signer is important, the position of the signer 
within a company or an organization can be even more important. Some 
contracts may only be valid if signed by a user in a particular role, 
e.g. a Sales Director. In many cases whom the sales Director really 
is, is not that important but being sure that the signer is empowered 
by his company to be the Sales Director is fundamental.

This document defines two different ways for providing this feature:

      * by placing a claimed role name in the CMS signed 
        attributes field;

     * by placing a attribute certificate containing a certified 
       role name in the CMS signed attributes field.

NOTE:  Another possible approach would have been to use additional 
attributes containing the roles name(s) in the signer's certificate. 
However, it was decided not to follow this approach as it breaks the 
basic philosophy of the certificate being issued for one primary 
purpose. Also, by using separate certificates for management of the 
signer's identity certificate and management of additional roles can 
simplify the management, as new identity keys need not be issued if a 
use of role is to be changed.

B.3.5.1  Claimed Role

The signer may be trusted to state his own role without any 
certificate to corroborate this claim. In which case the claimed role 
can be added to the signature as a signed attribute.

B.3.5.2  Certified Role

Unlike public key certificates that bind an identifier to a public 
key, Attribute Certificates bind the identifier of a certificate to 
some attributes, like a role. An Attribute Certificate is NOT issued 
by a CA but by an Attribute Authority (AA). The Attribute Authority 
will be most of the time under the control of an organization or a 
company that is best placed to know which attributes are relevant for 
which individual. 









ETSI TC-SEC, Pinkas, Ross, Pope       Informational RFC       [Page 68]
Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats

The Attribute Authority may use or point to public key certificates 
issued by any CA, provided that the appropriate trust may be placed 
in that CA. Attribute Certificates may have various periods of 
validity. That period may be quite short, e.g. one day. While this 
requires that a new Attribute Certificate is obtained every day, valid 
for that day, this can be advantageous since revocation of such 
certificates may not be needed. When signing, the signer will have to 
specify which Attribute Certificate it selects. In order to do 
so, a reference to the Attribute Certificate will have to be included 
in the signed data in order to be protected by the digital signature 
from the signer.

In order to identify unambiguously the attribute certificate(s) to be 
used for the verification of the signature an identifier of the 
attribute certificate(s) from the signer must be part of the signed 
data.

B.3.5  Signer Location

In some transactions the purported location of the signer at the time 
he or she applies his signature may need to be indicated. For this 
reason an optional location indicator must be able to be included.

In order to provide indication of the location of the signer at the 
time he or she applied his signature a  location attribute may be 
included in the signature.

B.3.6  Signing Time

The definition of electronic signature includes: "a commitment has 
been explicitly endorsed under a signature policy, at a given time, 
by a signer under an identifier, e.g. a name or a pseudonym, and 
optionally a 
role. "

There are several ways to address this problem. The solution adopted 
in this document is to sign over a time which the signer claims is the 
signing time (i.e. claimed signing time) and to require a trusted 
time stamp to be obtained when building a ES with Timestamp. When a 
verifier accepts a signature, the two times must be within acceptable 
limits. 

The solution that is adopted in this document offers the major 
advantage that electronic signatures can be generated without any on-
line connection to a trusted time source (i.e. they may be generated 
off-line).

Thus two dates and two signatures are required: 

     * a signing time indicated by the signer and which is part of 
       the data signed by the signer (i.e. part of the basic 
       electronic signature);



ETSI TC-SEC, Pinkas, Ross, Pope       Informational RFC       [Page 69]
Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats


     * a time indicated by a TimeStamping Authority (TSA) which is 
       signed over the digital signature value of the basic electronic
       signature. The signer, verifier or both may obtain the TSA
       timestamp.

In order for an electronic signature to be valid under a signature 
policy, it must be timestamped by a TSA where the signing time as 
indicated by the signer and the time of time stamping as indicated by 
a TSA must be "close enough" to meet the requirements of the signature 
validation policy. 

"Close enough" means a few minutes, hours or even days according to 
the "Signature Validation Policy". 

NOTE:  The need for Timestamping is further explained in clause B.4.5.
A further optional attribute is defined in this document to timestamp 
the content, to provide proof of the existence of the content, at the 
time indicated by the timestamp.

Using this optional attribute a trusted secure time may be obtained 
before the document is signed and included under the digital signature.
This solution requires an on-line connection to a trusted timestamping 
service before generating the signature and may not represent the 
precise signing time, since it can be obtained in advance.  However, 
this optional attribute may be used by the signer to prove that the 
signed object existed before the date included in the timestamp (see 
3.12.3, Content Timestamp).

Also, the signing time should be between the time indicated by this 
timestamp and time indicated by the ES-T timestamp.

B.3.7  Content Format

When presenting signed data to a human user it may be important that 
there is no ambiguity as to the presentation of the signed information 
to the relying party. In order for the appropriate representation 
(text, sound or video) to be selected by the relying party a content 
hint may be indicated by the signer. If a relying party system does not 
use the format specified in the content hints to present the data to 
the relying party, the electronic signature may not be valid.

B.4  Components of Validation Data

B.4.1  Revocation Status Information

A verifier will have to prove that the certificate of the signer was 
valid at the time of the signature. This can be done by either:

     * using Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs);

     * using responses from an on-line certificate status server 
       (for example; obtained through the OCSP protocol).


ETSI TC-SEC, Pinkas, Ross, Pope       Informational RFC       [Page 70]
Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats

B.4.2  CRL Information

When using CRLs to get revocation information, a verifier will have to 
make sure that he or she gets at the time of the first verification the
appropriate certificate revocation information from the signer's CA. 
This should be done as soon as possible to minimize the time delay 
between the generation and verification of the signature. This involves
checking that the signer certificate serial number is not included in 
the CRL. The signer, the verifier or any other third party may obtain 
either this CRL. If obtained by the signer, then it must be conveyed 
to the verifier. It may be convenient to archive the CRL for ease of 
subsequent verification or arbitration. 

Alternatively, provided the CRL is archived elsewhere which is 
accessible for the purpose of arbitration, then the serial number of 
the CRL used may be archived together with the verified electronic 
signature.

It may happen that the certificate serial number appears in the CRL 
but with the status "suspended" (i.e. on hold). In such a case, the 
electronic signature is not yet valid, since it is not possible to 
know whether the certificate will or will not be revoked at the end 
of the suspension period. If a decision has to be taken immediately 
then the signature has to be considered as invalid. If a decision can 
wait until the end of the suspension period, then two cases are 
possible:

     * the certificate serial number has disappeared from the list 
       and thus the certificate can be considered as valid and that 
       CRL must be captured and archived either by the verifier or 
       elsewhere and be kept accessible for the purpose of arbitration.

     * the certificate serial number has been maintained on the list 
       with the status definitively revoked and thus the electronic 
       signature must be considered as invalid and discarded.

At this point the verifier may be convinced that he or she got a valid 
signature, but is not yet in a position to prove at a later time that 
the signature was verified as valid. Before addressing this point, an 
alternative to CRL is to use OCSP responses.















ETSI TC-SEC, Pinkas, Ross, Pope       Informational RFC       [Page 71]
Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats

B.4.3  OCSP Information

When using OCSP to get revocation information , a verifier will have 
to make sure that he or she gets at the time of the first verification 
an OCSP response that contains the status "valid". This should be done 
as soon as possible after the generation of the signature. The signer, 
the verifier or any other third party may fetch this OCSP response. 
Since OSCP responses are transient and thus are not archived by any 
TSP including CA, it is the responsibility of every verifier to make 
sure that it is stored in a safe place. The simplest way is to store 
them associated with the electronic signature. An alternative would be 
to store them in some storage so that they can then be easily 
retrieved. 

In the same way as for the case of the CRL, it may happen that the 
certificate is declared as invalid but with the secondary status 
"suspended". 

In such a case, the electronic signature is not yet valid, since it is 
not possible to know whether the certificate will or will not be 
revoked at the end of the suspension period. If a decision has to be 
taken immediately then the electronic signature has to be considered 
as invalid. If a decision can wait until the end of the suspension 
period, then two cases are possible:

     * An OCSP response with a valid status is obtained at a later 
       date and thus the certificate can be considered as valid and 
       that OCSP response must be captured.


     * An OCSP response with an invalid status is obtained with a 
       secondary status indicating that the certificate is 
       definitively revoked and thus the electronic signature must be 
       considered as invalid and discarded.

As in the CRL case, at this point, the verifier may be convinced that 
he or she got a valid signature, but is not yet in a position to prove 
at a later time that the signature was verified as valid. 

B.4.4  Certification Path

A verifier will have to prove that the certification path was valid, 
at the time of the signature, up to a trust point according to the 
naming constraints and the certificate policy constraints from the 
"Signature Validation Policy". It will be necessary to capture all the 
certificates from the certification path, starting with those from the 
signer and ending up with those of the self-signed certificate from 
one trusted root of the "Signature Validation Policy". In addition, it 
will be necessary to capture the Authority Revocation Lists (ARLs) to 
prove than none of the CAs from the chain was revoked at the time of 
the signature.




ETSI TC-SEC, Pinkas, Ross, Pope       Informational RFC       [Page 72]
Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats

As in the OCSP case, at this point, the verifier may be convinced that 
he or she got a valid signature, but is not yet in a position to prove 
at a later time that the signature was verified as valid.

B.4.5  Timestamping for Long Life of Signature

An important property for long standing signatures is that a 
signature, having been found once to be valid, must continue to be so 
months or years later. 

A signer, verifier or both may be required to provide on request, 
proof that a digital signature was created or verified during the 
validity period of the all the certificates that make up the 
certificate path. In this case, the signer, verifier or both will 
also be required to provide proof that all the user and CA 
certificates used were not revoked when the signature was created 
or verified. 

It would be quite unacceptable, to consider a signature as invalid 
even if the keys or certificates were later compromised. Thus there 
is a need to be able to demonstrate that the signature keys was valid 
around the time that the signature was created to provide long term 
evidence of the validity of a signature.

It could be the case that a certificate was valid at the time of the 
signature but revoked some time later. In this event, evidence must be 
provided that the document was signed before the signing key was 
revoked. 

Timestamping by a Time Stamping Authority (TSA) can provide such 
evidence. A time stamp is obtained by sending the hash value of the 
given data to the TSA. The returned "timestamp" is a signed document 
that contains the hash value, the identity of the TSA, and the time of 
stamping. This proves that the given data existed before the time of 
stamping. Timestamping a digital signature (by sending a hash of the 
signature to the TSA) before the revocation of the signer's private 
key, provides evidence that the signature has been created before the 
key was revoked.


If a recipient wants to hold a valid electronic signature he will have 
to ensure that he has obtained a valid time stamp for it, before that 
key (and any key involved in the validation) is revoked. The sooner 
the timestamp is obtained after the signing time, the better.

It is important to note that signatures may be generated "off-line" 
and time-stamped at a later time by anyone, for example by the signer 
or any recipient interested in the value of the signature. The time 
stamp can thus be provided by the signer together with the signed 
document, or obtained by the recipient following receipt of the signed 
document.




ETSI TC-SEC, Pinkas, Ross, Pope       Informational RFC       [Page 73]
Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats

The time stamp is NOT a component of the Electronic Signature, but the 
essential component of the ES with Timestamp.

It is required in this document that signer's digital signature value 
is timestamped by a trusted source, known as a TimeStamping Authority.

This document requires that the signer's digital signature value is 
timestamped by a trusted source before the electronic signature can 
become a ES with Complete validation data (ES-C). The acceptable TSAs 
are specified in the Signature Validation Policy.

Should both the signer and verifier be required to timestamp the 
signature value to meet the requirements of the signature policy, the 
signature policy MAY specify a permitted time delay between the two 
time stamps.

B.4.6  Timestamping before CA Key Compromises

Timestamped extended electronic signatures are needed when there is a 
requirement to safeguard against the possibility of a CA key in the 
certificate chain ever being compromised. A verifier may be required 
to provide on request, proof that the certification path and the 
revocation information used a the time of the signature were valid, 
even in the case where one of the issuing keys or OCSP responder keys 
is later compromised.


The current document defines two ways of using timestamps to protect 
against this compromise:

    * Timestamp the ES with Complete validation data, when an OCSP 
      response is used to get the status of the certificate from the
      signer.

    * Timestamp only the certification path and revocation information 
      references when a CRL is used to get the status of the 
      certificate from the signer.

NOTE:  the signer, verifier or both may obtain the timestamp.
















ETSI TC-SEC, Pinkas, Ross, Pope       Informational RFC       [Page 74]
Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats

B.4.6.1  Timestamping the ES with Complete validation data

When an OCSP response is used, it is necessary to time stamp in 
particular that response in the case the key from the responder would 
be compromised. Since the information contained in the OCSP response 
is user specific and time specific, an individual time stamp is needed 
for every signature received. Instead of placing the time stamp only 
over the certification path references and the revocation information 
references, which include the OCSP response, the time stamp is placed 
on the ES-C. Since the certification path and revocation information 
references are included in the ES with Complete validation data they 
are also protected. For the same cryptographic price, this provides an 
integrity mechanism over the ES with Complete validation data. Any 
modification can be immediately detected. It should be noticed that 
other means of protecting/detecting the integrity of the ES with 
Complete Validation Data exist and could be used. 

Although the technique requires a time stamp for every signature, it 
is well suited for individual users wishing to have an integrity 
protected copy of all the validated signatures they have received.

By timestamping the complete electronic signature, including the 
digital signature as well as the references to the certificates and 
revocation status information used to support validation of that 
signature, the timestamp ensures that there is no ambiguity in the 
means of validating that signature.

This technique is referred to as ES with eXtended validation data 
(ES-X), type 1 Timestamped in this document. 

NOTE:  Trust is achieved in the references by including a hash of the 
data being referenced. 

If it is desired for any reason to keep a copy of the additional data 
being referenced, the additional data may be attached to the 
electronic signature, in which case the electronic signature becomes 
a ES-X Long as defined by this document.

A ES-X Long Timestamped  is simply the concatenation of a ES-X 
Timestamped  with a copy of the additional data being referenced.

B.4.6.2  Timestamping Certificates and Revocation Information 

References Timestamping each ES with Complete validation data as 
defined above may not be efficient, particularly when the same set of 
CA certificates and CRL information is used to validate many 
signatures.








ETSI TC-SEC, Pinkas, Ross, Pope       Informational RFC       [Page 75]
Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats

Timestamping CA certificates will stop any attacker from issuing bogus 
CA certificates that could be claimed to existing before the CA key 
was compromised. Any bogus timestamped CA certificates will show that 
the certificate was created after the legitimate CA key was 
compromised. In the same way, timestamping CA CRLs, will stop any 
attacker from issuing bogus CA CRLs which could be claimed to existing 
before the CA key was compromised.

Timestamping of commonly used certificates and CRLs can be done 
centrally, e.g. inside a company or by a service provider. This method 
reduces the amount of data the verifier has to timestamp, for example 
it could reduce to just one time stamp per day (i.e. in the case were 
all the signers use the same CA and the CRL applies for the whole day).
The information that needs to be time stamped is not the actual 
certificates and CRLs but the unambiguous references to those 
certificates and CRLs.

To comply with extended validation data, type 2 Timestamped, this 
document requires the following: 

     * All the CA certificates references and revocation information 
       references (i.e. CRLs) used in validating the ES-C are covered
       by one or more timestamp. 

Thus a ES-C with a timestamp signature value at time T1, can be proved 
valid if all the CA and CRL references are timestamped at time T1+.

B.4.7  Timestamping for Long Life of Signature 

Advances in computing increase the probability of being able to break 
algorithms and compromise keys. There is therefore a requirement to be 
able to protect electronic signatures against this probability.

Over a period of time weaknesses may occur in the cryptographic 
algorithms used to create an electronic signature (e.g. due to the 
time available for cryptoanalysis, or improvements in cryptoanalytical 
techniques). Before this such weaknesses become likely, a verifier 
should take extra measures to maintain the validity of the electronic 
signature. Several techniques could be used to achieve this goal 
depending on the nature of the weakened cryptography. In order to 
simplify, a single technique, called Archive validation data, covering 
all the cases is being used in this document.

Archive validation data consists of the Complete validation data and 
the complete certificate and revocation data, time stamped together 
with the electronic signature. The Archive validation data is 
necessary if the hash function and the crypto algorithms that were 
used to create the signature are no longer secure. Also, if it cannot 
be assumed that the hash function used by the Time Stamping Authority 
is secure, then nested timestamps of Archived Electronic Signature are 
required. 




ETSI TC-SEC, Pinkas, Ross, Pope       Informational RFC       [Page 76]
Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats

The potential for Trusted Service Provider (TSP) key compromise should 
be significantly lower than user keys, because TSP(s) are expected to 
use stronger cryptography and better key protection. It can be expected
that new algorithms (or old ones with greater key lengths) will be 
used. In such a case, a sequence of timestamps will protect against 
forgery. Each timestamp needs to be affixed before either the 
compromise of the signing key or of the cracking of the algorithms used
by the TSA. TSAs (TimeStamping Authorities) should have long keys (e.g.
which at the time of drafting this document was 2048 bits for the 
signing RSA algorithm) and/or a "good" or different algorithm.

Nested timestamps will also protect the verifier against key compromise
or cracking the algorithm on the old electronic signatures.

The process will need to be performed and iterated before the 
cryptographic algorithms used for generating the previous time stamp 
are no longer secure. Archive validation data may thus bear multiple 
embedded time stamps.

B.4.8  Reference to Additional Data

Using type 1 or 2 of Timestamped extended validation data verifiers 
still needs to keep track of all the components that were used to 
validate the signature, in order to be able to retrieve them again 
later on. These components may be archived by an external source like 
a trusted service provider, in which case referenced information that 
is provided as part of the ES with Complete validation data (ES-C) is 
adequate. The actual certificates and CRL information reference in the 
ES-C can be gathered when needed for arbitration. 

B.4.9  Timestamping for Mutual Recognition

In some business scenarios both the signer and the verifier need to 
timestamp their own copy of the signature value. Ideally the two 
timestamps should be as close as possible to each other.

Example: A contract is signed by two parties A and B representing 
their respective organizations, to timestamp the signer and verifier 
data two approaches are possible:

      * under the terms of the contract pre-defined common "trusted"
        TSA may be used;













ETSI TC-SEC, Pinkas, Ross, Pope       Informational RFC       [Page 77]
Internet Draft                             Electronic Signature Formats

      * if both organizations run their own timestamping services, A 
        and B can have the transaction timestamped by these two
        timestamping services. In the latter case, the electronic 
        signature will only be considered as valid, if both timestamps 
        were obtained in due time (i.e. there should not be a long 
        delay between obtaining the two timestamps). Thus, neither A 
        nor B can repudiate the signing time indicated by their own 
        timestamping service. 

Therefore, A and B do not need to agree on a common "trusted" TSA to 
get a valid transaction.

It is important to note that signatures may be generated "off-line" 
and timestamped at a later time by anyone, e.g. by the signer or any 
recipient interested in validating the signature. The timestamp over 
the signature from the signer can thus be provided by the signer 
together with the signed document, and /or obtained by the verifier 
following receipt of the signed document.

The business scenarios may thus dictate that one or more of the long-
term signature timestamping methods describe above be used. This will 
need to be part of a mutually agreed the Signature Validation Policy 
with is part of the overall signature policy under which digital 
signature may be used to support the business relationship between the 
two parties. 

B.4.10  TSA Key Compromise

TSA servers should be built in such a way that once the private 
signature key is installed, that there is minimal likelihood of 
compromise over as long as possible period. Thus the validity period 
for the TSA's keys should be as long as possible.

Both the ES-T and the ES-C contain at least one time stamp over the 
signer's signature. In order to protect against the compromise of the 
private signature key used to produce that timestamp, the Archive 
validation data can be used when a different TimeStamping Authority key 
is involved to produce the additional timestamp. If it is believed that 
the TSA key used in providing an earlier timestamp may ever be 
compromised (e.g. outside its validity period), then the ES-A should be 
used. For extremely long periods this may be applied repeatedly using 
new TSA keys.

B.5  Multiple Signatures

Some electronic signatures may only be valid if they bear more than one 
signature. This is the case generally when a contract is signed between 
two parties. The ordering of the signatures may or may not be 
important, i.e. one may or may not need to be applied before the other. 
Several forms of multiple and counter signatures may need to be 
supported, which fall into two basic categories:

     * independent signatures;
     * embedded signatures.

Independent signatures are parallel signatures where the ordering of 
the signatures is not important. The capability to have more than one 
independent signature over the same data must be provided.

Embedded signatures are applied one after the other and are used where 
the order the signatures are applied is important. The capability to 
sign over signed data must be provided.

These forms are described in clause 3.13. All other multiple signature 
schemes, e.g. a signed document with a countersignature, double 
countersignatures or multiple signatures, can be reduced to one or more 
occurrence of the above two cases. 


Annex C (informative):  Identifiers and roles

C.1  Signer Name Forms

The name used by the signer, held as the subject in the signer's 
certificate, must uniquely identify the entity.  The name must be 
allocated and verified on registration with the Certification 
Authority, either directly or indirectly through a Registration 
Authority, before being issued with a Certificate.

This document places no restrictions on the form of the name. The 
subject's name may be a distinguished name, as defined in [RFC2459], 
held in the subject field of the certificate, or any other name form 
held in the X.509 subjectAltName certificate extension field. In the 
case that the subject has no distinguished name, the subject name can 
be an empty sequence and the subjectAltName extension must be critical.

C.2  TSP Name Forms

All TSP name forms (Certification Authorities, Attribute Authorities 
and TimeStamping Authorities) must be in the form of a distinguished 
name held in the subject field of the certificate.

The TSP name form must include the legal jurisdiction (i.e. country) 
under which it operates and an identification for the organization 
providing the service.

C.3  Roles and Signer Attributes

Where a signer signs as an individual but wishes to also identify 
him/herself as acting on behalf of an organization, it may be necessary 
to provide two independent forms of identification. The first identity, 
with is directly associated with the signing key identifies him/her as 
an individual. The second, which is managed independently, identifies 
that person acting as part of the organization, possibly with a given 
role.

In this case the first identity is carried in the 
subject/subjectAltName field of the signer's certificate as described 
above.

This document supports the following means of providing a second form 
of identification:

     * by placing a secondary name field containing a claimed role in 
       the CMS signed attributes field;

     * by placing an attribute certificate containing a certified role 
       in the CMS signed attributes field.
