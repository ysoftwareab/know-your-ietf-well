Internet-Draft          SeND Hash Threat Analysis              June 2008


Abstract

   This document analysis the use of hashes in SeND, possible threats
   and the impact of recent attacks on hash functions used by SeND.
   Current SeND specification [rfc3971] uses SHA-1 [sha-1] hash
   algorithm and PKIX certificates [rfc3280] and does not provide
   support for the hash algorithm agility.  Based on previous analysis,
   this document suggests multiple hash support that should be included
   in the SeND update specification.

Internet-Draft          SeND Hash Threat Analysis              June 2008


1.  Introduction

   The most common uses of hash functions are non-repudiable digital
   signatures on messages and digital signatures on certificates.  Both
   are affected by recent collision attacks and both are used in SeND
   [rfc4270].  SeND uses SHA-1 hash algorithm to produce contents of the
   RSA Signature option in ND message (Digital Signature field and Key
   Hash field).  PKIX certificates are used for the router authorization
   in Authorization Delegation Discovery (ADD) process.  Hash functions
   are also used in the statless autoconfiguration process that is based
   on CGAs.

   Theoretically, all mentioned uses of hash functions are affected by
   recent collision attacks.  According to our analysis in this
   document, none of these attacks are currently doable.  But we have to
   take into account that future attacks will be improved and provide a
   support for multiple hash algorithms.

3.  Impact of collision attacks on SeND

   "Hash algorithms are used by cryptographers in a variety of security
   protocols, for a variety of purposes, at all levels of the Internet
   protocol stack.  They are used because they have two security
   properties: to be one way and collision free."  "The recent attacks
   have demonstrated that one of those security properties is not
   true."[rfc4270] Following the approach recommended by [rfc4270] and
   [new-hashes], we will analyze the impact of these attacks on SeND
   case by case in this section.  Through our analysis, whether we
   should support hash agility on SeND is also discussed.

   Up to date, all demonstrated attacks are attacks against a collision-
   free property.  Attacks against the one-way property are not yet
   feasible [rfc4270].

3.1.  Attacks against CGAs in stateless autoconfiguration

   Hash functions are used in the stateless autoconfiguration process
   that is based on CGAs.  Impacts of collision attacks on current uses
   of CGAs are analyzed in the update of CGA specification [rfc4982],
   which also enables CGAs to support hash agility.  CGAs provide proof-
   of-ownership of the private key corresponding to the public key used
   to generate CGA, and they don't deal with the non-repudiation
   feature, while collision attacks are mainly about affecting non-
   repudiation feature.  While SeND is CGA based protocol, we are sure
   that the node that signes the message is the same as the node that
   creates the message and associated hash.  So, as [rfc4982] points out
   CGA based protocols, including SeND, are not affected by the recent
   collision attacks.

3.2.  Attacks against PKIX certificates in ADD process

   The second use of hash functions is for router auhtorization in ADD
   process.  Router sends to host a certification path, which is a path
   between a router and hosts's trust anchor and consists of PKIX
   certificates.  Researchers demonstrated attack against PKIX
   certificates with MD5 signature.  They succeded to construct the
   original and the false certificate that had the same identity data
   and digital signature, but different public key [new-hashes].  The
   problem for the attacker is that two certificates with the same
   identity are not very useful in real-world scenarios, while
   Certification Authority is not allowed to provide such two
   certificates.  Additionally, most certificate parts are not in danger
   because human-readable certificate fields are not affected by the
   collision attacks.  However, implementations SHOULD use human-
   readable certificate extensions only if SeND certificate profile
   demands.  We also have to take into account that attacker could



Kukec, et al.           Expires December 28, 2008               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft          SeND Hash Threat Analysis              June 2008


   produce such false certificate only if he could predict context-
   useful certificate data.  So, although collision attacks against PKIX
   certificates are theoretically possible, they can hardly be performed
   in practice.

   However, if attacker succeeds to perform attack, once in future when
   attacks will be improved, the most dangerous will be attacks against
   middle-certificates in the certification path, where for the cost of
   one false certificate, attacker launches attack on multiple routers.
   In such scenarios, We will be at least safe from attacks against
   Trust Anchor's certificate because it is not exchanged in SeND
   messages.  If attacker, for example, will manage to produce a false
   certificate with changed IP prefixes in IP subjectAltName extension
   (which is currently just theoretically possible), IP prefixes range
   will be broadened at maximum to the range from the Trust Anchor's
   certificate.

3.3.  Attacks against Digital Signature in RSA Signature option

   Digital signature in RSA Signature option is produced as the SHA-1
   hash of IPv6 addresses, ICMPv6 header and ND message and is signed
   with the sender's private key, which corresponds to the public key
   from the CGA parameters structure and is authorized usually through
   CGAs.  The possible attack on such explicit digital signature is
   typical non-repudiation attack.  Attacker could generate a false
   message with the same hash and sign that false hashed message with
   authorized private key.  However, the problem for the attacker is
   that they are very hard to predict the useful input data.  It
   minimizes the possibility for a real-world collision attack and the
   fact that in order to perform a succesfull real-world attack he can
   not change a human-readable data.  But we also have to take into
   account that a variant of SHA-1 was already affected by recent
   collision attacks and we have to prepare for future improved attacks.

3.4.  Attacks against Key Hash in RSA Signature option

   Key Hash field in the RSA Signature option is a SHA-1 hash of the
   public key from the CGA parameters structure in the CGA option of
   SeND message.  Key Hash field is a typical example of data
   fingerprinting, which is potentially dangerous because input field is
   a non human-readable data.  But the problem for the attacker is that
   a public key, which is input data is authorized through CGAs, and
   sometimes additionally through a certification path if peer has
   configured trust anchor.  For the succesfull attack, attacker has to
   break both SHA-1 hashed public key, as well as corresponding CGA and
   possiblly a certification path.  Otherwise, changed key pair will be
   detected in the process of CGA verification.  The same as in previous
   cases, this attack is theoretically possible, but very hard to

4.  Support for the hash agility in SeND

   While all of analyzed hash functions in SeND are theoretically
   affected by recent collision attacks, these attacks indicate the
   possibility of future real-world attacks.  In order to increase the
   future security of SeND, we suggest the support for the hash and
   algorithm agility in SeND.

   The most effective and secure would be to bind the hash function
   option with something that can not be changed at all, like [rfc4982]
   does for CGA - encoding the hash function information into addresses.
   But, there is no possibilty to do that in SeND.  We could decide to
   use by default the same hash function in SeND as in CGA, but this
   solution is architecturally strange and it does not really increase
   the security since the difficulty for attackers remain to break one
   single hash function.  Furthermore, it may even reduce the security
   level by providing more relevant information of the hash function.
   On the other side, the use of two different hash algorithms makes
   attacker's life harder.

   Another solution is to incorporate the hash function option into SeND
   message.  By putting a new hash function option in SeND message
   before RSA Signature option, attacker will have to break both the
   signature and the hash input at the same time since the new option
   will be input field for the Digital Signature in RSA Signature
   option.  However, we can not avoid a downgrade attack totally because
   peer might be using just ND and not SeND.  A completely safe solution
   here does not exist.  A new hash function option in SeND message is a
   reasonable and the best solution for the hash algorithm agility
   support in SeND.

   Each implementation SHOULD use different hash or signature algorithms
   for each of the relevant fields (Key Hash field, Digital Signature,
   PKIX signature algorithm).  Since all algorithms are in different
   procedures, making them the same does not make those procedures
   simpler, but making them different complicates possible attacks.

4.1.  Hash algorithm option

   In order to provide hash algorithm agility, each SeND implemenation
   MUST support the Hash algorithm option.  The Hash algorithm option
   defines:

   o  a hash algorithm that MUST be used for producing the RSA Signature
      option (Key Hash field) - HA-KH,

   o  a hash algorithm that MUST be used for producing the RSA Signature
      option (Digital Signature field) - HA-DS,

   o  a PKIX signature algorithm that the sender of the Hash algorithm
      option is ready to accept and validate.  In order to enhance
      interoperability, implementations SHOULD also accept and validate
      PKIX certificates with a signature algorithm that has the higher
      encoding number than requested signature algorithm.
      Implementations MUST NOT accept PKIX certificates with signature
      algorithms marked with lower encoding.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines three new registries that have been created and
   are maintained by IANA.

   o  Hash Algorithm for Key Hash field (HA-KH).  The values in this
      name space are 5-bit unsigned integers.

   o  Hash Algorithm for Digital Signature field (HA-DS).  The values in
      this name space are 5-bit unsigned integers.

   o  Signature Algorithm (SA).  The values in this name space are 5-bit
      unsigned integers.

   Initial values for these registries are given below.  Future
   assignments are to be made through Standards Action [rfc2434].
   Assignments for each registry consist of a name, a value and a RFC
   number where the registry is defined.

   The following initial values are assigned for HA-KH in this document:

             Name        | Value |  RFCs
      -------------------+-------+------------
            SHA-1        | 00000 | this document

   The following initial values are assigned for HA-DS in this document:
