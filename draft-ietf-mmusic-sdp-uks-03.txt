 Unknown Key Share Attacks on uses of TLS with the Session Description
                             Protocol (SDP)
                      draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-uks-03

Abstract

   This document describes unknown key-share attacks on the use of
   Datagram Transport Layer Security for the Secure Real-Time Transport
   Protocol (DTLS-SRTP).  Similar attacks are described on the use of
   DTLS-SRTP with the identity bindings used in Web Real-Time
   Communications (WebRTC) and SIP identity.  These attacks are
   difficult to mount, but they cause a victim to be mislead about the
   identity of a communicating peer.  Simple mitigation techniques are
   defined for each.

1.  Introduction

   The use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) [TLS13] with the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) [SDP] is defined in [FINGERPRINT].
   Further use with Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) [DTLS] and
   the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [SRTP] is defined as
   DTLS-SRTP [DTLS-SRTP].

   In these specifications, key agreement is performed using TLS or
   DTLS, with authentication being tied back to the session description
   (or SDP) through the use of certificate fingerprints.  Communication
   peers check that a hash, or fingerprint, provided in the SDP matches
   the certificate that is used in the TLS or DTLS handshake.

   WebRTC identity (see Section 7 of [WEBRTC-SEC]) and SIP identity
   [SIP-ID] both provide a mechanism that binds an external identity to
   the certificate fingerprints from a session description.  However,
   this binding is not integrity-protected and therefore vulnerable to
   an identity misbinding attack - or unknown key-share (UKS) attack -

   where the attacker binds their identity to the fingerprint of another
   entity.  A successful attack leads to the creation of sessions where
   peers are confused about the identify of the participants.

   This document describes a TLS extension that can be used in
   combination with these identity bindings to prevent this attack.

   A similar attack is possible with the use of certificate fingerprints
   alone.  Though attacks in this setting are likely infeasible in
   existing deployments due to the narrow conditions necessary (see
   Section 2.1), this document also describes mitigations for this
   attack.

   The mechanisms defined in this document are intended to strengthen
   the protocol by preventing the use of unknown key shares in
   combination with other protocol or implementation vulnerabilities.

   This document assumes that signaling is integrity protected.
   However, as Section 7 of [FINGERPRINT] explains, many deployments
   that use SDP do not guarantee integrity of session signaling and so
   are vulnerable to other attacks.  [FINGERPRINT] offers key continuity
   mechanisms as a potential means of reducing exposure to attack in the
   absence of integrity protection.  Section 2.2 provides some analysis
   of the effect of key continuity in relation to the described attacks.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Unknown Key-Share Attack

   In an unknown key-share attack [UKS], a malicious participant in a
   protocol claims to control a key that is in reality controlled by
   some other actor.  This arises when the identity associated with a
   key is not properly bound to the key.

   An endpoint that can acquire the certificate fingerprint of another
   entity can advertise that fingerprint as their own in SDP.  An
   attacker can use a copy of that fingerprint to cause a victim to
   communicate with another unaware victim, even though it believes that
   it is communicating with the attacker.

   When the identity of communicating peers is established by higher-
   layer signaling constructs, such as those in SIP identity [SIP-ID] or
   WebRTC [WEBRTC-SEC], this allows an attacker to bind their own
   identity to a session with any other entity.

   The attacker obtains an identity assertion for an identity it
   controls, but binds that to the fingerprint of one peer.  The
   attacker is then able to cause a TLS connection to be established
   where two endpoints communicate.  The victim that has its fingerprint
   copied by the attack correctly believes that it is communicating with
   the other victim; however, the other victim incorrectly believes that
   it is communicating with the attacker.

   A similar attack can be mounted without any communications
   established based on the SDP "fingerprint" attribute [FINGERPRINT].

   This attack is an aspect of SDP-based protocols that the technique
   known as third-party call control (3PCC) [RFC3725] relies on.  3PCC
   exploits the potential for the identity of a signaling peer to be
   different than the media peer, allowing the media peer to be selected
   by the signaling peer.  Section 2.3 describes the consequences of the
   mitigations described here for systems that use 3PCC.

2.1.  Limits on Attack Feasibility

   The use of TLS with SDP depends on the integrity of session
   signaling.  Assuming signaling integrity limits the capabilities of
   an attacker in several ways.  In particular:

   1.  An attacker can only modify the parts of the session signaling
       for a session that they are part of, which is limited to their
       own offers and answers.

   2.  No entity will complete communications with a peer unless they
       are willing to participate in a session with that peer.

   The combination of these two constraints make the spectrum of
   possible attacks quite limited.  An attacker is only able to switch
   its own certificate fingerprint for a valid certificate that is
   acceptable to its peer.  Attacks therefore rely on joining two
   separate sessions into a single session.

   However, the second condition might not be necessary when using an
   identity binding such as those defined in [WEBRTC] or [SIP-ID].  When
   using an identity binding, the threat model assumes the possibility
   of attack by an entity with access to the signaling channel.
   Removing this constraint makes attacks considerably more feasible.

2.2.  Interactions with Key Continuity

   Systems that use key continuity might be able to detect an unknown
   key-share attack if a session with either the attacker or the geniune
   peer (i.e., the victim whose fingerprint was copied by an attacker)



Thomson & Rescorla        Expires July 8, 2019                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                   SDP UKS                    January 2019


   was established in the past.  Whether this is possible depends on how
   key continuity is implemented.

   Implementations that maintain a single database of identities with an
   index on peer keys could discover that the identity saved for the
   peer key does not match the claimed identity.  Such an implementation
   could notice the disparity between the actual keys (those copied from
   a victim) and the expected keys (those of the attacker).

   In comparison, implementations that first match based on peer
   identity could treat an unknown key-share attack as though their peer
   had used a newly-configured device.  The apparent addition of a new
   device could generate user-visible notices (e.g., "Mallory appears to
   have a new device").  However, such an event is not always considered
   alarming; some implementations might silently save a new key.

2.3.  Third-Party Call Control

   Third-party call control (3PCC) [RFC3725] is a technique where a
   signaling peer establishes a call that is terminated by a different
   entity.  This attack is very similar to the 3PCC technique, except
   where the TLS peers are aware of the use of 3PCC.

   For 3PCC to work with the proposed mechanisms, TLS peers need to be
   aware of the signaling so that they can correctly generate (and
   check) the extension.  It is understood that this technique will
   prevent the use of 3PCC if peers are not able to access signaling.

3.  Attack on Identity Bindings

   The identity assertions used for WebRTC (Section 7 of [WEBRTC-SEC])
   and the SIP PASSPoRT using in SIP identity ([SIP-ID], [PASSPoRT]) are
   bound to the certificate fingerprint of an endpoint.  An attacker
   causes an identity binding to be created that binds an identity they
   control to the fingerprint of a victim.

   An attacker can thereby cause a victim to believe that they are
   communicating with an attacker-controlled identity, when they are
   really talking to another entity of the attacker's choice.  The
   attacker only needs to create an identity assertion that covers a
   certificate fingerprint of their choosing.

   The problem might appear to be caused by the fact that the entity
   that certifies the identity binding is not required to verify that
   the entity requesting the binding controls the keys associated with
   the fingerprints.  Both SIP and WebRTC identity providers are not
   required to perform this validation.  This is not an issue because
   verifying control of the associated keys is not a necessary condition

   for a secure protocol, nor would it be sufficient to prevent attack
   [SIGMA].

   A simple solution to this problem is suggested by [SIGMA].  The
   identity of endpoints is included under a message authentication code
   (MAC) during the cryptographic handshake.  Endpoints then validate
   that their peer has provided an identity that matches their
   expectations.  In TLS, the Finished message provides a MAC over the
   entire handshake, so that including the identity in a TLS extension
   is sufficient to implement this solution.

   Rather than include a complete identity binding - which could be
   sizeable - a collision- and pre-image-resistant hash of the binding
   is included in a TLS extension.  Endpoints then need only validate
   that the extension contains a hash of the identity binding they
   received in signaling.  If the identity binding is successfully
   validated, the identity of a peer is verified and bound to the
   session.

   The same technique can be used to cause two victims to both believe
   they are talking to the attacker when they are talking to each other.

3.1.  Example

   In the example shown in Figure 1, it is assumed that the attacker
   also controls the signaling channel.

   Mallory (the attacker) presents two victims, Norma and Patsy, with
   two separate sessions.  In the first session, Patsy is presented with
   the option to communicate with Norma; a second session with Mallory
   is presented to Norma.

     Norma                   Mallory                   Patsy
     (fp=N)                   -----                    (fp=P)
       |                        |                        |
       |                        |<---- Signaling1 ------>|
       |                        |   Norma=N Patsy=P      |
       |<---- Signaling2 ------>|                        |
       |   Norma=N Mallory=P    |                        |
       |                                                 |
       |<=================DTLS (fp=N,P)=================>|
       |                                                 |
     (peer = Mallory!)                         (peer = Norma)

               Figure 1: Example Attack on Identity Bindings

   The attack requires that Mallory obtain an identity binding for their
   own identity with the fingerprints presented by Patsy (P).  This
   false binding is then presented to Norma.

   Patsy could be similarly duped, but in this example, a correct
   binding between Norma's identity and fingerprint (N) is faithfully
   presented by Mallory.

   The resulting DTLS session is established directly between Norma and
   Patsy.  Patsy correctly believes that they are communicating with
   Norma.  However, Norma incorrectly believes they are talking to
   Mallory.

   In order for this attack to work without compromising signaling
   integrity, it is likely that the attacker also needs to subvert the
   session as described in Section 4.  Endpoints can use the
   "external_session_id" extension (see Section 4.3) in addition to this
   so that two calls between the same parties can't be altered by an
   attacker.

3.2.  The external_id_hash TLS Extension

   The "external_id_hash" TLS extension carries a hash of the identity
   assertion that communicating peers have exchanged.

   The "extension_data" for the "external_id_hash" extension contains a
   "ExternalIdentityHash" struct, described below using the syntax
   defined in [TLS13]:

      struct {
         opaque binding_hash<0..32>;
      } ExternalIdentityHash;

   A WebRTC identity assertion is provided as a JSON [JSON] object that
   is encoded into a JSON text.  The resulting string is then encoded
   using UTF-8 [UTF8].  The content of the "external_id_hash" extension
   are produced by hashing the resulting octets with SHA-256 [SHA].
   This produces the 32 octets of the "binding_hash" parameter, which is
   the sole contents of the extension.

   The SDP "identity" attribute includes the base64 [BASE64] encoding of
   the same octets that were input to the hash.  The "external_id_hash"
   extension is validated by performing base64 decoding on the value of
   the SDP "identity" attribute, hashing the resulting octets using SHA-
   256, and comparing the results with the content of the extension.

   Where a PASSPoRT is used, the compact form of the PASSPoRT MUST be
   expanded into the full form.  The base64 encoding used in the



Thomson & Rescorla        Expires July 8, 2019                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                   SDP UKS                    January 2019


   Identity (or 'y') header field MUST be decoded then used as input to
   SHA-256.  This produces the 32 octet "binding_hash" value used for
   creating or validating the extension.

   Note:  Should SHA-256 prove to be inadequate at some point in the
      future (see [AGILITY]), a new TLS extension can be defined that
      uses a different hash function.

   Identity bindings in either form might be provided by only one peer.
   An endpoint that does not produce an identity binding MUST generate
   an empty "external_id_hash" extension in its ClientHello.  This
   allows its peer to include a hash of its identity binding.  An
   endpoint without an identity binding MUST include an empty
   "external_id_hash" extension in its ServerHello or
   EncryptedExtensions message, to indicate support for the extension.

   A peer that receives an "external_id_hash" extension that does not
   match the value of the identity binding from its peer MUST
   immediately fail the TLS handshake with an error.  This includes
   cases where the binding is absent, in which the extension MUST be
   present and empty.

   An "external_id_hash" extension that is any length other than 0 or 32
   is invalid and MUST cause the receiving endpoint to generate a fatal
   "decode_error" alert.

   A peer that receives an identity binding, but does not receive an
   "external_id_hash" extension MAY choose to fail the connection,
   though it is expected that implementations written prior to the
   definition of the extensions in this document will not support both
   for some time.

   In TLS 1.3, the "external_id_hash" extension MUST be sent in the
   EncryptedExtensions message.

4.  Unknown Key-Share with Fingerprints

   A similar attack can create a session where there is confusion about
   the communicating endpoints by substituting the fingerprint of a
   communicating endpoint.

   An endpoint that is configured to reuse a certificate can be attacked
   if it is willing to initiate two calls at the same time, one of which
   is with an attacker.  The attacker can arrange for the victim to
   incorrectly believe that is calling the attacker when it is in fact
   calling a second party.  The second party correctly believes that it
   is talking to the victim.

   As with the attack on identity bindings, this can be used to cause
   two victims to both believe they are talking to the attacker when
   they are talking to each other.

4.1.  Example

   In this example, two sessions are created with the same endpoint at
   the same time.  One of those sessions is initiated with the attacker,
   the second session is created toward another honest endpoint.  The
   attacker convinces the endpoint that their session has completed, and
   that the session with the other endpoint has succeeded.

   In addition to the constraints described in Section 2.1, the attacker
   in this example also needs to the ability to view and drop packets
   between victims.  That is, the attacker is on-path.

   The attack shown in Figure 2 depends on a somewhat implausible set of
   conditions.  It is intended to demonstrate what sort of attack is
   possible and what conditions are necessary to exploit this weakness
   in the protocol.

     Norma                   Mallory                 Patsy
     (fp=N)                   -----                  (fp=P)

       |<---Signaling1 (fp=P)---+                      |

       |                       |                       |

           Figure 2: Example Attack Scenario using Fingerprints

   In this scenario, there are two sessions initiated at the same time
   by Norma.  Signaling is shown with single lines ('-'), DTLS and media
   with double lines ('=').

   The first session is established with Mallory, who falsely uses
   Patsy's certificate fingerprint (denoted with 'fp=P').  A second
   session is initiated between Norma and Patsy.  Signaling for both
   sessions is permitted to complete.




Thomson & Rescorla        Expires July 8, 2019                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                   SDP UKS                    January 2019


   Once signaling is complete on the session that is ostensibly between
   Mallory and Norma is complete.  Mallory begins forwarding DTLS and
   media packets sent to her by Norma to Patsy.  These packets denoted
   'DTLS1' because Norma associates these with the first signaling
   session ('signaling1').

   Mallory also intercepts packets from Patsy and forwards those to
   Norma at the transport address that Norma associates with Mallory.
   These packets are denoted 'DTLS2' to indicate that Patsy associates
   these with the second signaling session ('signaling2'), however Norma
   will interpret these as being associated with the first signaling
   session ('signaling1').

   The second signaling exchange - 'signaling2', between Norma and Patsy
   - is permitted to continue to the point where Patsy believes that it
   has succeeded.  This ensures that Patsy believes that she is
   communicating with Norma.  In the end, Norma believes that she is
   communicating with Mallory, when she is really communicating with
   Patsy.

   Though Patsy needs to believe that the second signaling session has
   been successfully established, Mallory has no real interest in seeing
   that session complete.  Mallory only needs to ensure that Patsy does
   not abandon the session prematurely.  For this reason, it might be
   necessary to permit the signaling from Patsy to reach Norma to allow
   Patsy to receive a call completion signal, such as a SIP ACK.  Once
   the second session completes, Mallory might cause DTLS packets sent
   by Norma to Patsy to be dropped, though these will likely be
   discarded by Patsy.

   For the attacked session to be sustained beyond the point that Norma
   detects errors in the second session, Mallory also needs to block any
   signaling that Norma might send to Patsy asking for the call to be
   abandoned.  Otherwise, Patsy might receive a notice that the call is
   failed and thereby abort the call.

   This attack creates an asymmetry in the beliefs about the identity of
   peers.  However, this attack is only possible if the victim (Norma)
   is willing to conduct two sessions nearly simultaneously, if the
   attacker (Mallory) is on the network path between the victims, and if
   the same certificate - and therefore SDP "fingerprint" attribute
   value - is used in both sessions.

   Where ICE [ICE] is used, Mallory also needs to ensure that
   connectivity between Patsy and Norma succeed, either by forwarding
   checks or answering and generating the necessary messages.

4.2.  Unique Session Identity Solution

   An attack on DTLS-SRTP is possible because the identity of peers
   involved is not established prior to establishing the call.
   Endpoints use certificate fingerprints as a proxy for authentication,
   but as long as fingerprints are used in multiple calls, they are
   vulnerable to attack.

   The solution to this problem is to assign a new identifier to
   communicating peers.  Each endpoint assigns their peer a unique
   identifier during call signaling.  The peer echoes that identifier in
   the TLS handshake, binding that identity into the session.  Including
   this new identity in the TLS handshake means that it will be covered
   by the TLS Finished message, which is necessary to authenticate it
   (see [SIGMA]).  Validating that peers use the correct identifier then
   means that the session is established between the correct two
   endpoints.

   This solution relies on the unique identifier given to DTLS sessions
   using the SDP "tls-id" attribute [DTLS-SDP].  This field is already
   required to be unique.  Thus, no two offers or answers from the same
   client will have the same value.

   A new "external_session_id" extension is added to the TLS or DTLS
   handshake for connections that are established as part of the same
   call or real-time session.  This carries the value of the "tls-id"
   attribute and provides integrity protection for its exchange as part
   of the TLS or DTLS handshake.

4.3.  The external_session_id TLS Extension

   The "external_session_id" TLS extension carries the unique identifier
   that an endpoint selects.  When used with SDP, the value includes the
   "tls-id" attribute from the SDP that the endpoint generated when
   negotiating the session.  This document only defines use of this
   extension for SDP; other methods of external session negotiation can
   use this extension to include a unique session identifier.

   The "extension_data" for the "external_session_id" extension contains
   a ExternalSessionId struct, described below using the syntax defined
   in [TLS13]:

      struct {
         opaque session_id<20..255>;
      } ExternalSessionId;

   For SDP, the "session_id" field of the extension includes the value
   of the "tls-id" SDP attribute as defined in [DTLS-SDP] (that is, the



Thomson & Rescorla        Expires July 8, 2019                 [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                   SDP UKS                    January 2019


   "tls-id-value" ABNF production).  The value of the "tls-id" attribute
   is encoded using ASCII [ASCII].

   Where RTP and RTCP [RTP] are not multiplexed, it is possible that the
   two separate DTLS connections carrying RTP and RTCP can be switched.
   This is considered benign since these protocols are usually
   distinguishable.  RTP/RTCP multiplexing is advised to address this
   problem.

   The "external_session_id" extension is included in a ClientHello and
   either ServerHello (for TLS and DTLS versions less than 1.3) or
   EncryptedExtensions (for TLS 1.3).  In TLS 1.3, the
   "external_session_id" extension MUST NOT be included in a
   ServerHello.

   Endpoints MUST check that the "session_id" parameter in the extension
   that they receive includes the "tls-id" attribute value that they
   received in their peer's session description.  Endpoints can perform
   string comparison by ASCII decoding the TLS extension value and
   comparing it to the SDP attribute value, or compare the encoded TLS
   extension octets with the encoded SDP attribute value.  An endpoint
   that receives a "external_session_id" extension that is not identical
   to the value that it expects MUST abort the connection with a fatal
   "handshake_failure" alert.

   An endpoint that is communicating with a peer that does not support
   this extension will receive a ClientHello, ServerHello or
   EncryptedExtensions that does not include this extension.  An
   endpoint MAY choose to continue a session without this extension in
   order to interoperate with peers that do not implement this
   specification.

   In TLS 1.3, the "external_session_id" extension MUST be sent in the
   EncryptedExtensions message.

5.  Consequences of Session Concatenation

   Use of session identifiers does not prevent an attacker from
   establishing two concurrent sessions with different peers and
   forwarding signaling from those peers to each other.  Concatenating
   two signaling sessions creates a situation where both peers believe
   that they are talking to the attacker when they are talking to each
   other.

   This kind of attack is prevented by systems that enable peer
   authentication such as WebRTC identity [WEBRTC-SEC] or SIP identity
   [SIP-ID].  However, session concatention remains possible at higher




Thomson & Rescorla        Expires July 8, 2019                 [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                   SDP UKS                    January 2019


   layers: an attacker can establish two independent sessions and simply
   forward any data it receives from one into the other.

   In the absence of any higher-level concept of peer identity, the use
   of session identifiers does not prevent session concatenation.  The
   value to an attacker is limited unless information from the TLS
   connection is extracted and used with the signaling.  For instance, a
   key exporter [EXPORTER] might be used to create a shared secret or
   unique identifier that is used in a secondary protocol.

   If a secondary protocol uses the signaling channel with the
   assumption that the signaling and TLS peers are the same then that
   protocol is vulnerable to attack unless they also validate the
   identity of peers at both layers.  Use of the "external_session_id"
   does not guarantee that the identity of the peer at the TLS layer is
   the same as the identity of the signaling peer.

   It is important to note that multiple connections can be created
   within the same signaling session.  An attacker might concatenate
   only part of a session, choosing to terminate some connections (and
   optionally forward data) while arranging to have peers interact
   directly for other connections.  It is even possible to have
   different peers interact for each connection.  This means that the
   actual identity of the peer for one connection might differ from the
   peer on another connection.

   Information extracted from a TLS connection therefore MUST NOT be
   used in a secondary protocol outside of that connection if that
   protocol relies on the signaling protocol having the same peers.
   Similarly, data from one TLS connection MUST NOT be used in other TLS
   connections even if they are established as a result of the same
   signaling session.

6.  Security Considerations

   This entire document contains security considerations.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers two extensions in the TLS "ExtensionType
   Values" registry established in [TLS13]:

   o  The "external_id_hash" extension defined in Section 3.2 has been
      assigned a code point of TBD; it is recommended and is marked as
      "Encrypted" in TLS 1.3.
