 Abstract

    In 802.11 or similar technologies, the network device enters a
    æcell-search modeÆ when the signal level/quality of the serving AP
    drops below a certain value. In the cell-search mode, the device
    actively measures the signal level and/or quality of neighbouring
    APs in addition to that of the serving AP.

    This document describes how the use of MN originated cell-search
    list indications, which carry signal level and signal quality
    measurements of access points in the immediate vicinity of the
    mobile node, can assist in a handover scheme that factors in
    seamlessness, target router selection, context transfer and
    resource usage information.

 2. Introduction

    Mobile-IP protocols ([2002],[MIP6]), define how an MN can change
    its L3 point of interface to networks and yet maintain ongoing L4
    sessions. They are particularly important in wireless LAN
    environments consisting of multiple subnets.

    Related to these protocols is the concept of network-initiated pre-
    handover mobile-IP binding/registration, where the MN performs
    mobile-IP binding/registration procedures with new ARs while it is
    still on the old link ([LOWLATENCY], [FASTMIP6]), so that the
    change is seamless.

    Context transfer refers to the transfer of state from an oAR to a
    nAR as the mobile handovers from an old subnet to a new subnet.
    This state corresponds to L2/L3 security and QoS/resource
    configurations maintained by the oAR as a policy enforcement point
    for the MN ([CTX], [CTXREQ]).

    In 802.11 or similar technologies, the WIF enters a æcell-search
    modeÆ when the signal level/quality of the serving AP drops below a
    certain value. In the cell-search mode, the WIF actively measures
    the signal level and/or quality of neighbouring APs in addition to
    that of the serving AP.

    In a seamless, anticipative and resource-mindful IP handover
    scheme, the network intelligently determines the target access
    router among candidate routers, transfers the mobile nodeÆs context
    from the old router to this new router, and forwards Layer-3
    handover information associated with this new router to the mobile
    node before it performs a Layer-2 handover. In this wise, the
    overall handover latency as experienced by the MN is effectively
    reduced to the latency of the Layer-2 handover.

    The following sections describe how the use of MN originated cell-
    search list indications, which carry signal level and signal
    quality measurements of access points in the immediate vicinity of
    the mobile node, can assist in a handover scheme that factors in
    seamlessness, target router selection, context transfer and
    resource usage information.

    The concept of a wireless MN indicating signal level/quality 
    measurements of neighbour cells to the network is not new; it has 
    been used before in [GSMRR].

 3. Underlying Framework

    To describe the utility of the cell-search list indications, we
    must first describe an architecture for managing network-controlled
    seamless, anticipative & resource-mindful handovers over which it
    may be viable. An example of such an architecture is shown in Fig
    1.

      Fig 1 Example architecture for managing anticipative & resource-
                             mindful handovers


    In this example, we assume that handover is managed distributedly
    amongst ARs.

    Each AR has a resource management entity (RM) that communicates
    with its peers on neighbour ARs via an IARP. Typically, the ARs
    communicate resource usage information via RES-STAT-IND primitives
    as shown in Fig 2, at some intervals. Due to the sampling effect,
    this information is only statistically accurate to a certain
    confidence level. Within each RM is a handover management entity
    (HM) that acts as a coordinator of handovers.

    Between the MN and an AR, a L3 EAP exists to perform access
    registration and host configuration, e.g. [DHC6].

     Fig 2 ARs exchange resource usage information at regular intervals


    On each MN, a HM entity exists on an orthogonal plane that
    intersects with the TCP/IP plane at the IP and L2/MAC layer. It 
    utilises the EAP to send and respond to handover management 
    messages to and from its peer on the AR. The HM acts as a L2-L3 
    synchronising handover coordinator on the MN, in terms of gathering
    relevant information from or configuring the WIF via the WIF-SAP, 
    and configuring the IP layer synchronously.

    The WIF is a network device attached to the lower edge of IP, and
    hence its protocol stack is only defined up to the L2/MAC layer,
    e.g. 802.11. It exports the WIF-SAP, which is a set of well defined
    programming interfaces to obtain status information on and
    configure the L2/physical link that the WIF attaches to.

 4. The Cell-Search List Indications

    We now describe the use of the cell-search list indications and its
    ramifications in a handover scenario. In this scenario, distributed
    handover control is assumed, where each AR performs the router
    selection, context transfer and IP handover functions.

    We assume the MN is in the vicinity of three APs, oAP, nAP1 and
    nAP2 which also act as, or are on three subnets on which are, three
    ARs, oAR, nAR1 and nAR2, respectively. The MN is initially attached
    to oAP and shares some context with oAR.

    a) Due to some pre-configured trigger event, e.g. a neighbour AP's
       signal level going over the serving AP's signal level plus
       hysteresis (0), the MN starts a process which sends CSLIST-IND
       messages to the oAR at certain intervals, reporting on the
       signal level and/or signal quality of oAP, nAP1 and nAP2 (1b).
       These lists act as indications to the network of APs that are
       handover candidates in view of their signal level and/or
       quality.

    b) On receipt of this primitive, oAR determines if a handover is
       required. Assuming the oAR maintains topological information on
       the connectivity of neighbouring APs and ARs, and has a rough
       idea of the current state of network resources used in the
       vicinity, then the oAR can form a list of candidate ARs that it
       can attempt to handover the MN to, if a handover is required
       (2). The decision on whether to perform a handover, and the
       selection of candidate ARs, may be based on one part or a
       combination of the following criteria:

       i)   In terms of signal level/quality, the neighbour AP/AR(s)
            can serve the MN better than the current serving AP/AR,
            hysteresis accounted.

       ii)  In terms of network resources, it is discovered that some
            neighbour AP/ARs are under-utilised, and the network wishes
            to perform load-balancing.

       iii) In terms of policy, the MN is a better paying customer and
            should be moved to an æexclusiveÆ, overlapping set of
            AP/ARs providing better service, or the MN is a lower
            paying customer and should be moved to a lower grade
            connection.

       iv)  In terms of predicted direction and velocity of the MN,
            (based on time sequence samples given by the measurements),
            the neighbour AP/AR(s) have cell position and size
            characteristics that better suite the MN.

       Also, assume that the oAR, through the latest resource update it
       received, has the following resource usage information regarding
       its neigbours:

                         +------+------+------+------+
                         |  AP  | oAR  | nAR1 | nAR2 |
                         +------+------+------+------+
                         | RES  |  34  |  24  |  48  |
                         +------+------+------+------+

       Base on signal strengths alone, it would seem that nAP2/nAR2 is
       the best target for handover, followed by nAP1/nAR1. However,
       minding the resource usage information, letÆs say the HM entity
       on the oAR determines the following order in terms of target
       selection: nAP1/nAR1, nAP2/nAR2.

    c) Based on the order of nARs in this list, the oAR makes an
       attempt at nAR1 by sending a handover request (HO_REQ) message
       to it. This message carries QoS and/or security context
       information (oCtx) associated with the MN and oAR-nAR BET
       establishment primitives. If nAR1 rejects oCtx, perhaps due to
       lack of resources, it sends the handover reject message (HO_REJ)
       to oAR (3).

    d) On receipt of the rejection from nAR1, oAR proceeds to request a
       handover with nAR2, which is next in its candidate routers list.
       nAR2 accepts the handover request by sending the HO_CNF
       primitive carrying its router advertisement (nRA2), and, if
       stateful IP autoconfiguration is used, the new IP address
       (nCOA2) that the MN should use on its new link (4). The oAR then
       establishes a oAR-nAR2 BET.

    e) The oAR then sends a handover command to the MN, passing nAP2's
       tuning parameters (nAP2) and nRA2 and nCOA2, to which the MN
       responds by tuning to nAP2 and commiting the RA information to
       its IP stack (5).

    f) Thenafter, the MN and nAR2 exchanges messages to determine
       success or failure of the handover (6).


    The ability of the network to associate APs to ARs reguire that
    network maintain a list of the identities, channel, frequency
    and/or hardware addresses and associated subnets and ARs for every
    AP under its management.

    In the distributed approach, portions of this list are configured
    into ARs in the network via network management protocols such that
    each portion not only contains information on the APs on the subnet

    which the AR serves, but also on adjacent APs and the ARs on whose
    subnet they are connected to.


 5. Configuring the Cell-Search Threshold and List Indication

    In the course of initially associating with an AP on a network and
    registering for access with the network through the EAP, the MN
    should allow the network to configure the parameters associated
    with the sending of the cell-search list indications, such as the
    trigger event to enter the cell-search mode and start sending them,
    the sending rate and the window averaging operations on the
    SLEV/SQUA figures to be reported.

    In this wise, networks that have AP layouts with thick overlapping
    coverage areas can dictate a higher threshold for cell search and
    for triggering the cell-search list indications, which will in turn
    result in a longer time limit to setup the handover, and hence
    statistically improve the handover success rates. Fig 4 and Fig 5
    illustrates this option.

    The cell-search and list indication configuration message is
    described in section 7.1.

 6. The WIF-SAP

    In order to support the above scheme, the function of handover and
    AP-reassociation needs to be taken out of the wireless LAN adaptors
    (considered as Layer-2 in the IP stack), and promoted to the HM
    entity which is on par with the IP layer. This requires the
    adaptors to export programming interfaces to provide following
    functions:

    a) strict association with an AP by channel, frequency or MAC/
       hardware address, such that the adaptor does not change its AP
       association even when it moves out of the coverage of that AP
       (AP-ASSOC-CMD).

    b) configurable cell-search mode that provides periodic
       measurements of the signal level and/or quality of the serving
       neighbour APs (CSLIST-IND-L2).

    c) indication of the completion of the AP re-association procedure
       (AP_ASSOC_CMPLT_IND), in the case where a) is a non-blocking
       call.

    Fig 6 shows the use of these programming interfaces in relation to
    the handover scenario described in section 4.

 7. Suggested Message Structures

 7.1 Cell-Search and List Indication Configuration Command

    This element consists of the following sub-elements:

    a) Flag. This flag is used to indicate absence or presence of the
       following elements.

    b) Cell-Search Threshold. This is a technology-specific element and
       defines the threshold below which the MN should enter cell-
       search mode and start measuring the signal level and/or quality
       of nAPs.

    c) Measurement Condition Clause. This element dictates when the MN
       should start sending the CSLIST-IND messages. It consists of the
       following elements:

       i)   Condition Flag-Pairs. Bits in these flag-pairs denote
            conditions for which the MN should send the cell-search 
            list indication, e.g. with immediate effect, on serving AP
            signal level going under -X dBm, on a neighbour AP signal
            quality going X dBm above the serving AP's, etc. These
            bits come in pairs to allow 'and/or' conjugate conditions
            to be specified.

       ii)  Condition Parameters. For each condition specified in i)
            above, its associated X parameters are specified here.

    d) Measurement Method Clause. This element dictates the interval at
       which, and the number of times the cell-search list indications
       should be sent by the MN on meeting the condition clause. It
       consists of the following elements:

       i)   Method Flag. Bits in this flag denote methods, e.g. at
            regular X intervals, function mX + Y of signal
            level/quality, X number of times, apply X point sampling
            between indications, and Y window averaging using Z filter,
            etc.

       ii)  Method Parameters. For each method specified in i) above,
            its associated X,Y and Z parameters are specified here.


 7.2 Cell-Search List Indication (CSLIST-IND)

    This message consists of the following sub-elements:

      a) Measurement Flag. Bits in this flag determine if,

 Internet Draft      Cell-Search List For Handover            May 2002


         i)   The given measurements are valid/accurate.
         ii)  Signal level is measured.
         iii) Signal quality is measured.

      b) Number Of APs. This gives the number of APs for which
         measurements are included in this message.

      c) AP Measurements Entries. These contain the actual signal level
         and/or quality measurements for each AP that the MN measured.
         The number of entries is given by b) above. Each entry
         consists of the following elements:

         i)   AP Id. A mutually agreed number between the MN and the
              network identifying the AP.

         ii)  Channel/Frequency/MAC Address. This may be given in place
              of i).

         iii) Signal Level. This is the signal level measurement of the
              AP.

         iv)  Signal Quality. This is the signal quality of the AP.


 7.3 Handover Command (HO-CMD)

    The handover command message consists of the following sub-
    elements:

    a) AP Information. This element indicate to the MN the AP that it
       should handover to, and it includes:

       i)   AP Id. A mutually agreed number between the MN and the
            network identifying the AP.

       ii)  AP Tuning Parameters. This may be given in place of i).

    b) IP address on the new subnet. This element is present if an
       inter-subnet handover is required, and the network employs
       stateful IP configuration for MNs. It is the IP address that the
       MN should use on the new link.

    c) Router Information. This element is present if an inter-subnet
       handover is dictated. On IPv6 networks, it is basically the RA
       from the nAR.

 8. Security Considerations

    Over the air interface, all information elements may be sent
    encrypted using encryption methods made available by the EAP, and
    using a security context negotiated with the network in the course
    of registering for access.


 9. Scalability Considerations

    At the subnet level, the mechanism may add additional processing
    load on ARs, thus lowering the maximum number of MNs that can be
    attached to the subnet. However, at the network level, operations
    can be distributed across ARs. In this way, an increase in the
    number of MNs can be compensated by an increase in the number of
    subnet/ARs.
