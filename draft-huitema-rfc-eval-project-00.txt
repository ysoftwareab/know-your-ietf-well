                   draft-huitema-rfc-eval-project-00

Abstract

   This document presents a first attempt at evaluating the production
   of the IETF.  We analyze a set of randomly chosen RFC approved in
   2018, looking for history and delays, and using Google Scholar as a
   proxy for the RFC popularity.  The results are interesting, and
   inform further evaluation efforts.

1.  RFC Evaluation project

   As stated on the organization's web site, "The IETF is a large open
   international community of network designers, operators, vendors, and
   researchers concerned with the evolution of the Internet architecture
   and the smooth operation of the Internet."  In this memo, we start
   exploring how the IETF could possibly be evaluated, and we do so by
   attempting to evaluate the RFC production process.

   The IETF data tracker provides information about RFC and drafts, from
   which we can infer statistics about the production system.  We can



Huitema                 Expires February 1, 2020                [Page 2]

   measure how long it takes to drive a proposition from initial draft
   to final publication, and how these delays can be split between
   Working Group discussions, IETF reviews, IESG assessment, RFC Editor
   delays and final reviews by the authors.

   Just measuring production delays may be misleading.  The IETF
   produces standard proposals and informative memos that get published
   in the RFC series, but that is not its only purpose.  Two other
   purposes would be the organization of fruitful discussions between
   members of the technical community, and the filtering of ill-thought
   proposals so they are not endorsed in IETF publications.

   To try assess this other purposes, we have to find ways to measure
   the impact of the documents that were published.  If the
   communication between participants was efficient, the documents
   should be easily accepted by the community.  If bad ideas were
   filtered, the specifications should lead to deployed product and
   services with good feedback.

   A potential failure mode of the IETF is to do too much filtering.
   After all, classifying a proposal as ill-thought or potentially
   harmful is subjective.  A comprehensive analysis would look at the
   fate of proposals that were not accepted by the IETF but got
   developed in other ways and became eventually successful.  We will
   not try to assess that in this memo, but further studies migh
   consider the issue.

2.  Methodology

   In this exploration, we want to evaluate not just the mechanics of
   the RFC production, but also the quality and impact of the results.
   This evaluation of quality and impact is subjective.  We start with
   two ideas:

   1- Use Google Scholar to assess the citation counts of published
   documents

   2- Ask the RFC authors whether the specifications resulted in the
   deployment of products or services

   When accessing Google Scholar, we search for quoted strings of the
   form "RFC xxxx".  This is an arbitrary choice, we could for example
   have chosen to search for "RFCxxx" or a combination of the two forms.
   We retained the simpler alternative, because we don't believe that
   picking one or the other would introduce a significant bias.

   Basic production mechanisms could be evaluated by processing data
   from the IETF tracker, but subjective data requires manual assessment



Huitema                 Expires February 1, 2020                [Page 3]

   of results, which can be time consuming.  Google Scholar also
   requires manual access because the site does not offer an open API.
   Since our resources are limited, we will only perform this analysis
   for a small sample of RFC, selected at random from the list of RFC
   approved in 2018.  Specifically, we will pick 10 RFC at random
   between:

   o  RFC 8307, published in January 2018, and

   o  RFC 8511, published December 2018.

   In order to avoid injecting personal bias in the random selecton, we
   use a random selection process similar to the Nomination Committee
   selection process defined in [RFC3797].  The process is seeded with
   the text string "vanitas vanitatum et omnia vanitas", and the results
   are:

   When evaluating delays and impact, we will compare the year 2018 to
   2008 and 1998, 10 and 20 years ago.  To drive this comparison, we
   pick 20 RFC at random among those published in 2008, and another 20
   among those published in 1998.  We use the same nomcom-like
   methodology.

   For 2008, we picking random RFC numbers between RFC 5134 (January
   2008) and RFC 5405 (December 2008), using the sentence "sed fugit

   interea fugit irreparabile tempus" as a seed.  We actually list here
   21 numbers, because the random draw place RFC 5315 in 20th position,
   but that RFC was never issued.  We replace it by RFC 5301, which came
   in 21st position.

3.  Analysis of 20 selected RFC

   We review each of the RFC listed in (#methodology) for the year 2018,
   trying both to answer the known questions and to gather insight for
   further analyzes.  In many cases, the analysis of the data is
   complemented by direct feedback from the RFC authors.

   The long delay in Auth48 is probaby due to clustering with [RFC8410],
   which entered AUTH 48 on 06/05.  The MISSREF tracker code was cleared
   then.

3.2.  8456

   Benchmarking Methodology for Software-Defined Networking (SDN)

   The draft underwent very extensive copy editing, covering use of
   articles, turn of phrases, choice of vocabulary.  The changes are
   enough to cause pagination differences.  The "diff" tool marks pretty
   much every page as changed.  Some diagrams see change in protocol
   elements like message names.

   According to the author, the experience of producing this draft
   mirrors a typical one in the Benchmarking Methodologies Working Group
   (BMWG).There were multiple authors in multiple time zones, which
   slowed down the AUTH process somewhat, although the Auth48 delay of
   46 is only a bit longer than the average draft.

   The RFC was part of cluster with [RFC8455].

   Google Scholar shows 3 references.  BMWG publishes informational RFCs
   centered around benchmarking, and the methodologies in RFC 8456 have
   been implemented in benchmarking products.

3.3.  8446

   The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3 [RFC8446], as
   the title indicates, defines the new version of the TLS protocol.
   From the datatracker, we extract the following:

   The RFC was a major effort in the IETF.  Working group members
   developed and tested several implementations.  Researchers analyzed
   the specifications and performed to formal verification.  Deployment
   tests outlined issues that caused extra work when the specification
   was almost ready.  These complexity largely explains the time spent
   in the working group.

   Comparing the final draft to the published version, we find
   relatively light copy editing.  It includes explaining acronyms on
   first use, clarifying some definitions standardizing punctiation and
   capitalization, and spelling out some numbers in text.  This
   generally fall in the category of "style", although some of the
   clarifications go into message definitions.  However, that simple
   analysis does not explain why the Auth48 phase took almost two
   months.

   According to the author, the main reason was a requirement to have
   author and AD review each proposed change, down to any single comma.
   The concern there was that any change in a complex specification
   might affect a protocol that was extensively reviewed in the working
   group.  The author asked the RFC editors to back away a number of
   edits that he considered spurious.  This took a long time, partly
   because it was very hard to distinguish the edits that were editorial
   from those that were typesetting.

   The RFC has 123 references in Google Scholar.  There are 21
   implementations listed in the Wiki of the TLS 1.3 project.  It has
   been deployed on major browsers.

   the WG, and then to drive initial work/evolutions from the WG.

   mentions "blockage by a minority of politically-savvy persons."  Once
   the WG was created, other work was higher priority than working on
   the use case.

   This RFC took only 9 months from first draft to publication, which is
   the shortest in the 2018 sample set.  In part, this is because the
   text was privately circulated and reviewed before the first draft was
   published.  The nature of the document is another reason for the
   short delay.  It is an opinion piece, and does not require the same
   type of consensus building and reviews than a protocol specification.

   Comparing the final draft and the published version shows only minor
   copy edit, mostly for style.  According to the author, because this
   is because he knows how to write in RFC Style with the result that
   his documents often need a minimum of editing.  He also makes sure
   that the document on which the Production Center starts working
   already has changes discussed and approved during Last Call and IESG
   review incorporated rather than expecting the Production Center to
   operate off of notes about changed to be made.

   was using for storing provably generated RSA keys.  This is a short
   RFC that was published relatively quickly, although discussion
   between the author, the Independent Series Editor and the IESG lasted
   several months.  The IESG actually asked the ISE to not publish this
   document, because "it extends an IETF protocol in a way that requires
   IETF review and should therefore not be published without IETF review
   and IESG approval.  The ISE overruled that advice.

   This RFC recommends to deprecate two encryption algorithms that are
   now considered obsolete and possibly broken.  The document was sent
   back to the WG after the first last call, edited, and then there was
   a second last call.  The delay from first draft to working group last
   call was relatively short, but thenumber may be misleading.  The
   initial draft was a replacement of a similar draft in the KITTEN
   working group, which stagnated for some time before the VURDLE
   working group took up the work.  The deprecation of RC4 was somewhat
   contentious, but the WG had already debated this prior to the
   production of this draft, and the draft was not delayed by this
   debate.

   Most of the 280 days between IETF LC and IESG approval was because
   the IESG had to talk about whether this document should obsolete or
   move to historic RFC 4757, and no one was really actively pushing
   that discussion for a while.

   The 99 days in AUTH48 are mostly because one of the authors was a
   sitting AD, and those duties ended up taking precedence over
   reviewing this document.

   Minor copy editing, for style.

   The TCP congestion control algorithm Cubic was defined first in 2005,
   was implemented in Linux soon after, and was implemented in major
   OSes after that.  After some debates from 2015 to 2015, the TCPM
   working group adopted the draft, with a goal of documenting Cubic in
   the RFc series.  According to the authors, this was not a high
   priority effort, as Cubic was already implemented in multiple OSes
   and documented in research papers.  At some point, only one of the
   authors was actively working on the draft.  Ths may explain why
   another two years was spent progressing the draft after adoption by
   the WG.

   The RFC publication may or may not have triggered further
   implementations.  On the other hand, several OSes picked up bug fixes
   from the draft and the RFC.

   progress it.  The draft was parked in 2013 by the WG chairs after
   failing to get consensus in WG last call.  The AD finally pulled the
   plug in 2016, and the draft was then resubmitted to the ISE.

   At that point, the author was busy and was treating this RFC with a
   low priority because, in his words, it would not be a "real RFC".
   There were problems with the draft that only came up late.  It was
   written back before TLS1.3 existed and the author had to add TLS1.3
   support onto it late in the process.  He also got a very late comment
   while in AUTH48 that caused some rewrite.  Finally, there was some
   IANA issue with the extension registry where a similar extension was
   added by someone else.  The draft was changed to just use it.

   Changes in AUTH48 include added reference to TLS 1.3, copy-editing
   for style, some added requirements, added paragraphs, and changes in
   algorithms specification.

   setbacks occurred at the start: it took a while to find a home for
   this draft.  It was presented in the TLS WG (because it's a TLS
   extension) and UTA WG (because it has to do with applications using
   TLS).  Then the ADs determined that a new WG was needed, so the

   is due to the complexity of the problem, and the need to wait for
   implementations.  It is a very important change to OSPF that makes
   OSPFv3 fully extensible.  Since it was a non-backward compatible
   change, the developers started out with some very complex migration

   IPv4, IPv6, and IPv4-IPv6 Coexistence: Updates for the IP Performance

   RFC8468 was somehow special in that there was not a technical reason/
   interest that triggered it, but rather a formal requirement.  While
   writing RFC7312 the IP Performance Metrics working group (IPPM)
   realized that RFC 2330, the IP Performance Metrics Framework
   supported IPv4 only and explicitly excluded support for IPv6.
   Nevertheless, people used the metrics that were defined on top of RFC
   2330 (and, therefore, IPv4 only) for IPv6, too.  Although the IPPM WG
   agreed that the work was needed, the interest of IPPM attendees in
   progressing (and reading/reviewing) the IPv6 draft was limited.
   Resolving the IPv6 technical part was straight-forward, but
   subsequently some people asked for a broader scope (topics like
   header compression, 6lo, etc.) and it took some time to figure out
   and later on convince people that these topics are out of scope.  The
   group also had to resolve contentious topics, for example how to
   measure the processing of IPv6 extension headers, which is sometimes
   non-standard.

   The Auth48 delay for this draft was longer than average.  According
   to the authors, the main reasons include:

   o  Work-load and travel caused by busy-work-periods of all co-authors

   o  Time zone difference between co-authors and editor (at least US,
      Europe, India, not considering travel)

   o  Editor proposing and committing some unacceptable modifications
      that needed to be reverted

   o  Lengthy discussions on a new document title (required high effort
      and took a long time, in particular reaching consensus between co-
      authors and editor was time-consuming and involved the AD)

   o  Editor correctly identifying some nits (obsoleted personal
      websites of co-authors) and co-authors attempting to fix them.

   The differences between the final draft and the publish RFC show copy
   editing for style and clarity, but do not account for the back and
   forth between authors and editors mentioned by the authors.

   2 references on Google Scholar.  In contrast, RFC 2330 has more than
   3000 references, including over 70 that are more recent than RFC
   8468.  The authors believe that many of these references include IPv6
   work that should formally reference RFC 8468 in addition to RFC 2330,
   but do not.

4.  Observations

   We examine the 20 RFC in the sample, measuring various
   characteristics such as delay and citation counts, in an attempt to
   identify patterns in the IETF processes.

4.1.  Publication delays

   We look at the distribution of delays between the submission of the
   first draft and the publication of the RFC.  We break out the total
   delay in three components:

   o  The working group delay, from the first draft to the start of the
      IETF last call;

   o  The IETF delay, which lasts from the beginning of the IETF last
      call to the approval by the IESG, including the reviews by various
      directorates;

   o  The RFC production, from approval by the IESG to publication,
      including the Auth48 reviews.

   For submissions to the independent stream, we don't have a working
   group.  We consider instead the progression of the individual draft
   until the adoption by the ISE as the equivalent of the "working
   group" period, and the delay from adoption by the ISE until
   submission to the RFC Editor as the equivalent of the IETF delay.
   The following table shows the delays for the 20 RFC in the sample:

   The average delay from first draft to publication is about 3 years,
   but this varies widely.  Excluding the independent stream
   submissions, the average delay from start to finish is 3 years and 3

   months, of which on average 2 years and 8 months are spent getting
   consensus in the working group.

   The longest delay is found for [RFC8492], 6.5 years from start to
   finish.  This is however a very special case, a draft that was
   prepared for the TLS working group and failed to reach consensus.
   After that, it was resubmitted to the ISE, and incurred atypical
   production delays.

   On average, we see that 80% of the delay is incurred in WG
   processing, 10% in IETF review, and 10% for edition and publication.
   We can compare these delays to those observed 10 years ago and 20
   years ago:

   The IETF takes three to four times more times to produce an RFC in
   2018 than it did in 1998, but about the sametime as it did in 1998.

   The increased delay does not mean increased work per RFC.  The number
   of RFC published per year remained between 200 and 300 all those
   years, and the number of participants is not greater now than in
   1998.  If we estimated the "level of attention" by dividing the
   number of participants by the number of RFC produced, we would see a
   number that remains stable.  People are probably not working much
   more on each RFC now than they were 20 years ago, but the same amount
   of work is stretched over a much longer period.

4.2.  Citation Counts

   Part of the exercise is to test whether citation counts provide a
   useful measure of the popularity of the IETF production.  These
   citation counts vary widely:

   The results indicate that [RFC8446] is by far the most popular of the
   20 RFC in our sample.  This is not surprising, since TLS is a key
   Internet Protocol.  Of the other publications, only 4 have 5 to 9
   citations, and the others have three or less.

   In order to get a baseline, we can look at the number of references
   for the RFC published in 2008 and 1998.  However, we need totake time
   into account.  Documents published a long time ago are expected to
   have accrued more references.  We try to address this by looking at
   three counts for each document: the overall number of references over
   the document's lifetime, the number of references obtained in the
   year following publication, and the number of references observed
   since 2018:

   The total numbers shows a decreasing number of references over time.
   This can be explain to some degree by the passage of time.  If we
   restrict the analysis to the number of references accrued in the year
   of publishing and the year after that, we still see decreasing
   numbers.  For example, the top quartile of RFC published in 1998 had
   at least 19 references by the end of 1999, while the top quartile of
   RFC published in 2008 only had at least 12 references, which is twice
   the corresponding number for the RFC of 2018.

   We also see that the number of references to RFC fades over time.
   Only the most popular of the RFC produced in 1998 are still
   referenced in 2019.  The overall popularity of the RFC series benefit
   from a history of publishing relevant documents, but over time the
   references to historic documents will decrease and the overall
   popularity will depend on more recent documents.

   We need however to be a bit cautious before asserting that
   publications with a low citation count have limited impact:

   o  some documents may well accumulate more citations over time.  For
      example, [RFC8377] updates [RFC6455].  There are more than 1000
      citations of [RFC6455] on Google Scholar.  We might expect that
      the citation count of [RFC8377] will increase in the coming years.

   o  citation counts largely come from academic publications, and thus
      reflect popularity within researchers more than popularity with
      network operators and vendors.

   We should be able to assess the popularity of specifications with
   vendors, operators and designers by asking questions about deployed
   services and products.

4.3.  Preparation and Publication delays

   The preparation and publication delays include three components:

   o  the delay from submission to the RFC Editor to beginning of
      Auth48, during which the document is prepared;

   o  the AUTH48 delay, during which authors review and eventually
      approve the changes proposed by the editors;

   o  the publication delay, from final agreement by authors and editors
      to actual publication.

   The breakdown of the publication delays for each RFC is shown in the
   following table.

   On average, the total delay appears to be a bit more than four month,
   but the average is skewed by the extreme values encountered for
   [RFC8492].  If we exclude that RFC from the computations, the average
   delay drops to a just a bit more than 3 months: about 2 months for
   the preparation, a bit more than one month for the Auth48 phase, and
   4 days for the publishing.

   Of course, these delays vary from RFC to RFC.  To try explain the
   causes of the delay, we compute the correlation factor between the
   observed delays and 4 plausible explanation factors:

   o  The number of pages in the document,

   o  The amount of copy edit, as discussed in (#copy-editing),

   o  Whether or not an IANA action was required.

   We find the following values:

            +-------------+----------+---------+-------------+
            | Correlation | RFC edit | Auth 48 | Edit(total) |
            +-------------+----------+---------+-------------+
            | Nb pages    |     0.50 |   -0.04 |        0.21 |
            |             |          |         |             |
            | Copy-Edit   |     0.42 |    0.24 |        0.45 |
            |             |          |         |             |
            | IANA        |    -0.13 |    0.26 |        0.15 |
            +-------------+----------+---------+-------------+

   None of these indicate strong correlations.  The greater number of
   pages will tend to increase the preparation delay, but it does not
   appear to impact the Auth48 delay at all.  The amount of copy editing
   also tend to increase the the preparation delay somewhat and the
   Auth48 delay a little.  The presence or absence of IANA action has
   very ittle correlation with the delays.

   We also observe that the Auth48 delay varies much more than the
   preparation delay, with a standard deviation of 20 days for Auth48
   versus 10 days for the preparation delay.  In theory, Auth48 is just
   a final verification: the authors receive the document prepared by
   the RFC production center, and just have to give their approval, or
   maybe request a last minute correction.  The name indicates that this
   is expected to last just two days, but in average it lasts more than
   a month.

   We tested a variety of hypotheses that might explain the duration of
   AUTH48 by computing the correlation coefficients between various

   properties of the RFC and the production delays.  The results are
   listed in the following table:

   +----------------------+----------------+---------+-----------------+
   | Correlation          | RFC production | Auth 48 | RFC Edit(total) |

   | Nb drafts            |           0.19 |    -0.3 |           -0.17 |
   |                      |                |         |                 |
   | Nb Authors           |            0.4 |   -0.04 |            0.16 |
   |                      |                |         |                 |
   | WG delay             |           0.03 |   -0.16 |           -0.15 |
   +----------------------+----------------+---------+-----------------+

   The results show that there is no simple answer.  The number of
   pages, the required amount of copy editing and to a very small extent
   the number of drafts can help predict the production delay, but there
   is no obvious predictor for the Auth 48 delay.  In particular, there
   is no numerical evidence that the number of authors influences the
   Auth48 delay, or that authors who have spent a long time working on
   the document in the working group somehow spend even longer to answer
   questions during Auth48 - if anything, the numerical results point in
   the opposite direction.

   After asking the authors of the RFC in the sample why the AUTH48
   phase took a long time, and we got three explanations:

   1- Some RFC have multiple authors in multiple time zones.  This slows
   down the coordination required for approving changes.

   2- Some authors found some of the proposed changes unnecessary or
   undesirable, and asked that they be reversed.  This required long
   exchanges between authors and editors.

   3- Some authors were not giving high priority to AUTH48 responses.

   As mentioned above, we were not able to verify these hypotheses by
   looking at the data.

4.4.  Copy editing

   We can assess the amount of copy editing applied to each published
   RFC by comparing the text of the draft approved for publication and
   the text of the RFC.  We do expect differences in the "boilerplate"
   and in the IANA section, but we will also see differences due to copy
   editing.  Assessing the amount of copy editing is subjective, and we
   do it using a scale of 1 to 4:

   1- Minor editing

   2- Editing for style, such as capitalization, hyphens, that versus
   which, and expending all acronyms at least one.

   3- Editing for clarity in addition to style, such as rewriting
   ambiguous sentences and clarifying use of internal references.  For
   Yang models, that may include model corrections suggested by the
   verifier.

   4- Extensive editing.

   The following table shows that with about half of the RFC required
   editing for style, and the other half at least some editing for
   clarity.

   This method of assessment does not take into account the number of
   changes proposed by the editors and eventually rejected by the
   authors, since these changes are not present in either the final
   draft or the published RFC.  It might be possible to get an
   evaluation of these "phantom changes" from the RFC Production Center.

Internet-Draft                  RFC-Eval                       July 2019


4.5.  Independent Series

   Out of 20 randomly selected RFC, 3 were published through the
   "independent series".  One is an independent opinion, another a
   description of a non-IETF protocol format, and the third was
   [RFC8492], which is a special case.  Apart from this special case,
   the publication delays were significantly shorter for the Independent
   Stream than for the IETF stream.  This seems to indicate that the
   Independent Series is functioning as expected.

   The authors of these 3 RFC are regular IETF contributors.  This
   pbservation motivated a secondary analysis of all the RFC published
   in the "independent" stream in 2018.  There are 14 such RFC: 8507,
   8494, 8493, 8492, 8483, 8479, 8433, 8409, 8374, 8369, 8367, 8351,
   8328 and 8324.  (RFC 8367 and 8369 were published on 1 April 2018.)
   We can ask whether the authors of these RFC are these outsiders, part
   of a "wider community" or are people who are also contributing to the
   IETF.  The overwhelming response is, "insiders".  Pretty much all the
   authors are or were involved in the IETF, many of them with a
   prominent track record.  There are just 2 exceptions, a single RFC in
   which only 3 of the 5 authors are well associated with the IETF.

5.  Next steps

   This draft is not really complete.  We have obtained feedback from
   many authors but not all.  We should also get a review from the RFC
   Production Center.  We may want to find a better way of looking at
   citations than simple queries on Google Scholar.

   Even with those limitations, the exercise shows some promise, and
   also shows the interest of doing more studies.  For example, one of
   the plausible questions is whether the IETF impact is increasing or
   decreasing over time.  We could do that by repeating the statistical
   sampling analysis for previous years, for example 2008 and 1998.

6.  Security considerations

   This draft does not specify any protocol.

   We might want to analyze whether security issues were discovered
   after publication of specific standards.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This draft does not require any IANA action.

   Peliminary analysis does not indicate that IANA is causing any
   particular delay in the publication process.
