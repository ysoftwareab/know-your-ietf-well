Abstract

   This document define a new form of name, called permanent 
   identifier, that may be included in the subjectAltName extension 
   of a public key certificate issued to an entity.

   The permanent identifier is an optional feature that may be used 
   by a CA to indicate that the certificate relates to the same 
   entity even if the name or the affiliation of that entity has 
   changed.

   The subject name when carried in the subject field is only unique 
   for each subject entity certified by the one CA as defined by the 
   issuer name field. This new form of name also can carry a 
   name that is unique for each subject entity certified by any CA.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

   Please send comments on this document to the ietf-pkix@imc.org
   mailing list.

1  Introduction

   This specification is one part of a family of standards for the 
   X.509 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for the Internet. It is based 
   on RFC 2459, which defines underlying certificate formats and 
   semantics needed for a full implementation of this standard.

   The subject field of a public key certificate identifies the entity 
   associated with the public key stored in the subject public key 
   field. Names and identities of a subject may be carried in the 
   subject field and/or the subjectAltName extension. Where it is 
   non-empty, the subject field MUST contain an X.500 distinguished 
   name (DN). The DN MUST be unique for each subject entity certified 
   by a single CA as defined by the issuer name field.

   The subject name changes whenever any of the components of that 
   name gets changed. There are several reasons for such a change to 
   happen.

         For employees of a company or organization, the person may get 
         a different position within the same company and thus will 
         move from one organization unit to another one. Including the 
         organization unit in the name may however be very useful to 
         allow the relying parties (RPÆs) using that certificate to 
         identify the right individual.

         For citizens, an individual may change their name by legal 
         processes, especially women as a result of marriage.

         Any certificate subject identified by geographical location may
         relocate and change at least some of the location attributes 

         (e.g. country name, state or province, locality, or street).

   A permanent identifier may be useful both in the context of access 
   control and of non repudiation.

         For access control, the permanent identifier may be used in 
         an ACL (Access Control List) instead of the DN or any other 
         form of name and would not need to be changed, even if the 
         subject name of the entity changes.

         For non-repudiation, the permanent identifier may be used to 
         link different transactions to the same entity, even when 
         the subject name of the entity changes.

   When two certificates from the same CA contain the same permanent 
   identifier value, then these certificates relate to the same 
   entity, whatever the content of the DN or other subjectAltName
   components may be.

   When two certificates from different CAÆs contain both the same 
   permanent identifier value and the same type of permanent 
   identifier from a given Assigner Authority, then these

Permanent Identifier                  Document Expiration:  August 2002

   certificates relate to the same entity, whatever the content of 
   the DN or other subjectAltName components may be.

2. Definition of a Permanent Identifier

   A CA which includes a permanent identifier in a certificate is 
   certifying that any public key certificate containing that 
   identifier refers to the same entity, whatever the content of 
   the DN or other subjectAltName components may be.

   The use of a permanent identifier is optional. This name is 
   defined as a form of otherName from the GeneralName structure in 
   SubjectAltName. The permanent identifier is defined as follows:

   id-on-permanentIdentifier   AttributeType ::= { id-on 2 }

     PermanentIdentifier ::=     SEQUENCE {
        identifierValue                      IdentifierValue,
        identifierType                       IdentifierType OPTIONAL
     }

     IdentifierValue ::= CHOICE {
            iA5String            IA5String,
            uTF8String           UTF8String
     }

     IdentifierType ::= CHOICE {
            registeredOID                   OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
            uniformResourceIdentifier       IA5String,
            intluniformResourceIdentifier   UTF8String
     }

   The IdentifierType field, when present, identifies both the 
   organization responsible for assigning the content of the 
   identifier field and the type of that field.

   When the IdentifierType field is missing, then it is assumed that 
   the organization responsible for assigning the content of the 
   identifier field is the CA itself and that there is only one type 
   of such identifier for the CA.

   Two forms of values are supported for the IdentifierValue: 
   IA5String or UTF8String.

   The IdentifierType field may contain a registeredOID in the form of :

           a) an Object Identifier (i.e. an OID), or
           b) a permanent URI using IA5String, or
           c) a permanent URI using UTF8String.

   Characteristically, when an OID is used, the prefix of the OID 
   identifies the organization, and a suffix is used to identify the 
   type of permanent identifier being identified.  Essentially the 
   same thing is true of URIÆs. 

Pinkas, Gindin                                                [ Page 3]


Permanent Identifier                  Document Expiration:  August 2002


   If identifierType is missing, then the permanent identifier is 
   locally unique to the CA.

   If identifierType is present, then the permanent identifier is 
   globally unique among all CAÆs.

Note: the full arc of the object identifier is derived using:

   id-pkix OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) identified-organization(3) 
   dod(6) internet(1) security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) }

id-on   OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pkix 8 }    -- other name forms

3. Security considerations

   A given entity may have at an instant of time or at different 
   instants of time multiple forms of identities. 

   If the permanent identifier is locally unique to the CA (i.e. 
   identifierType is not present), then two certificates from the 
   same CA can be compared. When they contain two identical permanent 
   identifiers, then a relying party  may determine that they refer to 
   the same entity.

   If the permanent identifier is globally unique among all CAÆs (i.e. 
   identifierType is present), then two certificates from different 
   CAÆs can be compared. When they contain two identical permanent 
   identifiers, then a relying party may determine that they refer to 
   the same entity.

   The permanent identifier identifies the entity, irrespective of any 
   attribute extension. When a public key certificate contains 
   attribute extensions, the permanent identifier, if present, should 
   not be used for access control purposes but only for audit purposes. 
   The reason is that since these attributes may change, access could 
   be granted on attributes that were originally present in a 
   certificate issued to that entity but are no more present in the 
   current certificate.

B. OIDÆs for organizations

In order to obtain an OID for an identifier type, organizations need 
first to have a registered OID for themselves (or must use a permanent 
URI). In some cases, OIDÆs are provided for free. In other cases a 
one-time fee is required. The main difference lies in the nature of 
the information that is collected at the time of registration and how 
this information is verified for its accuracy.

B.1. Using IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)

The application form for a Private Enterprise Number in the IANA's 
OID list is: http://www.iana.org/cgi-bin/enterprise.pl. 

Currently IANA assigns numbers for free. The IANA-registered Private 
Enterprises prefix is: iso.org.dod.internet.private.enterprise 
(1.3.6.1.4.1)

These numbers are used, among other things, for defining private 
SNMP MIBs.

The official assignments under this OID are stored in the IANA file 
"enterprise-numbers" available at: 
ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/enterprise-numbers

B.2. Using an ISO member body

ISO has defined the OID structure in a such a way so that every ISO 
member-body has its own unique OID. Then every ISO member-body is free 
to allocate its own arc space below. 

Organizations and enterprises may contact the ISO member-body where 
their organization or enterprise is established to obtain an 
organization/enterprise OID.

Currently, ISO members do not assign organization/enterprise OIDÆs for 
free. 

Most of them do not publish registries of such OIDÆs which they have 
assigned, sometimes restricting the access to registered organizations 
or preferring to charge inquirers for the assignee of an OID on a 
per-inquiry basis. The use of OIDÆs from an ISO member organization 
which does not publish such a registry may impose extra costs on the 
CA that needs to make sure that the OID corresponds to the registered 
organization.

As an example, AFNOR (Association Francaise de Normalisation - the 
French organization that is a member of ISO) has defined an arc to 
allocate OIDÆs for companies: 

{iso (1) member-body (2) fr (250) type-org (1) organisation (n)}
