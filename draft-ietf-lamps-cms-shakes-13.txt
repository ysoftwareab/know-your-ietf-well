                              Syntax (CMS)
                     draft-ietf-lamps-cms-shakes-13

Abstract

   This document updates the "Cryptographic Message Syntax Algorithms"
   (RFC3370) and describes the conventions for using the SHAKE family of
   hash functions in the Cryptographic Message Syntax as one-way hash
   functions with the RSA Probabilistic signature and ECDSA signature
   algorithms.  The conventions for the associated signer public keys in
   CMS are also described.

2.  Introduction

   The "Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)" [RFC5652] is used to
   digitally sign, digest, authenticate, or encrypt arbitrary message
   contents.  "Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Algorithms" [RFC3370]
   defines the use of common cryptographic algorithms with CMS.  This
   specification updates RFC3370 and describes the use of the SHAKE128
   and SHAKE256 specified in [SHA3] as new hash functions in CMS.  In
   addition, it describes the use of these functions with the RSASSA-PSS
   signature algorithm [RFC8017] and the Elliptic Curve Digital

   Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) [X9.62] with the CMS signed-data content
   type.

   In the SHA-3 family, two extendable-output functions (SHAKEs),
   SHAKE128 and SHAKE256, are defined.  Four other hash function
   instances, SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, and SHA3-512, are also
   defined but are out of scope for this document.  A SHAKE is a
   variable length hash function defined as SHAKE(M, d) where the output
   is a d-bits-long digest of message M.  The corresponding collision
   and second-preimage-resistance strengths for SHAKE128 are
   min(d/2,128) and min(d,128) bits, respectively (Appendix A.1 [SHA3]).
   And the corresponding collision and second-preimage-resistance
   strengths for SHAKE256 are min(d/2,256) and min(d,256) bits,
   respectively.  In this specification we use d=256 (for SHAKE128) and
   d=512 (for SHAKE256).

   A SHAKE can be used in CMS as the message digest function (to hash
   the message to be signed) in RSASSA-PSS and ECDSA, message
   authentication code and as the mask generation function (MGF) in
   RSASSA-PSS.  This specification describes the identifiers for SHAKEs
   to be used in CMS and their meaning.

2.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Identifiers

   This section identifies eight new object identifiers (OIDs) for using
   SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 in CMS.

   Two object identifiers for SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 hash functions are
   defined in [shake-nist-oids] and we include them here for
   convenience.

     id-shake128 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { joint-iso-itu-t(2)
          country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) csor(3)

     id-shake256 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { joint-iso-itu-t(2)
          country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) csor(3)
          nistAlgorithm(4) 2 12 }

Internet-Draft                SHAKEs in CMS                    July 2019


   In this specification, when using the id-shake128 or id-shake256
   algorithm identifiers, the parameters MUST be absent.  That is, the
   identifier SHALL be a SEQUENCE of one component, the OID.

   [I-D.ietf-lamps-pkix-shake] [ EDNOTE: Update reference with the RFC
   when it is ready ] defines two identifiers for RSASSA-PSS signatures
   using SHAKEs which we include here for convenience.

     id-RSASSA-PSS-SHAKE128  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { iso(1)
               identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1)
               security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) algorithms(6)
               TBD1 }

     id-RSASSA-PSS-SHAKE256  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { iso(1)
               identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1)
               security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) algorithms(6)
               TBD2 }

   The same RSASSA-PSS algorithm identifiers can be used for identifying
   public keys and signatures.

   [I-D.ietf-lamps-pkix-shake] [ EDNOTE: Update reference with the RFC
   when it is ready ] also defines two algorithm identifiers of ECDSA
   signatures using SHAKEs which we include here for convenience.

     id-ecdsa-with-shake128 OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { iso(1)
               identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1)
               security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) algorithms(6)
               TBD3 }

     id-ecdsa-with-shake256 OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { iso(1)
               identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1)
               security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) algorithms(6)
               TBD4 }

   The parameters for the four RSASSA-PSS and ECDSA identifiers MUST be
   absent.  That is, each identifier SHALL be a SEQUENCE of one
   component, the OID.

   Two object identifiers for KMACs using SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 as
   defined in by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
   (NIST) in [shake-nist-oids] and we include them here for convenience.

          nistAlgorithm(4) 2 20 }

   The parameters for id-KmacWithSHAKE128 and id-KmacWithSHAKE256 are
   OPTIONAL.

   Section 4.1, Section 4.2.1, Section 4.2.2 and Section 4.4 specify the
   required output length for each use of SHAKE128 or SHAKE256 in
   message digests, RSASSA-PSS, ECDSA and KMAC.

4.  Use in CMS

4.1.  Message Digests

   The id-shake128 and id-shake256 OIDs (Section 3) can be used as the
   digest algorithm identifiers located in the SignedData, SignerInfo,
   DigestedData, and the AuthenticatedData digestAlgorithm fields in CMS
   [RFC5652].  The OID encoding MUST omit the parameters field and the
   output length of SHA256 or SHAKE256 as the message digest MUST be 256
   or 512 bits, respectively.

   The digest values are located in the DigestedData field and the
   Message Digest authenticated attribute included in the
   signedAttributes of the SignedData signerInfo.  In addition, digest
   values are input to signature algorithms.  The digest algorithm MUST
   be the same as the message hash algorithms used in signatures.

4.2.  Signatures

   In CMS, signature algorithm identifiers are located in the SignerInfo
   signatureAlgorithm field of SignedData content type and
   countersignature attribute.  Signature values are located in the
   SignerInfo signature field of SignedData content type and
   countersignature attribute.

   Conforming implementations that process RSASSA-PSS and ECDSA with
   SHAKE signatures when processing CMS data MUST recognize the
   corresponding OIDs specified in Section 3.

   When using RSASSA-PSS or ECDSA with SHAKEs, the RSA modulus or ECDSA
   curve order SHOULD be chosen in line with the SHAKE output length.
   Refer to Section 6 for more details.

4.2.1.  RSASSA-PSS Signatures

   The RSASSA-PSS algorithm is defined in [RFC8017].  When id-RSASSA-
   PSS-SHAKE128 or id-RSASSA-PSS-SHAKE256 specified in Section 3 is
   used, the encoding MUST omit the parameters field.  That is, the
   AlgorithmIdentifier SHALL be a SEQUENCE of one component, id-RSASSA-
   PSS-SHAKE128 or id-RSASSA-PSS-SHAKE256.  [RFC4055] defines RSASSA-
   PSS-params that are used to define the algorithms and inputs to the
   algorithm.  This specification does not use parameters because the
   hash, mask generation algorithm, trailer and salt are embedded in the
   OID definition.

   The hash algorithm to hash a message being signed and the hash
   algorithm as the mask generation function used in RSASSA-PSS MUST be
   the same: both SHAKE128 or both SHAKE256.  The output length of the
   hash algorithm which hashes the message SHALL be 32 (for SHAKE128) or
   64 bytes (for SHAKE256).

   The mask generation function takes an octet string of variable length
   and a desired output length as input, and outputs an octet string of
   the desired length.  In RSASSA-PSS with SHAKEs, the SHAKEs MUST be
   used natively as the MGF function, instead of the MGF1 algorithm that
   uses the hash function in multiple iterations as specified in
   Section B.2.1 of [RFC8017].  In other words, the MGF is defined as
   the SHAKE128 or SHAKE256 output of the mgfSeed for id-RSASSA-PSS-
   SHAKE128 and id-RSASSA-PSS-SHAKE256, respectively.  The mgfSeed is
   the seed from which mask is generated, an octet string [RFC8017].  As
   explained in Step 9 of section 9.1.1 of [RFC8017], the output length
   of the MGF is emLen - hLen - 1 bytes. emLen is the maximum message
   length ceil((n-1)/8), where n is the RSA modulus in bits. hLen is 32
   and 64-bytes for id-RSASSA-PSS-SHAKE128 and id-RSASSA-PSS-SHAKE256,
   respectively.  Thus when SHAKE is used as the MGF, the SHAKE output
   length maskLen is (8*emLen - 264) or (8*emLen - 520) bits,
   respectively.  For example, when RSA modulus n is 2048, the output
   length of SHAKE128 or SHAKE256 as the MGF will be 1784 or 1528-bits
   when id-RSASSA-PSS-SHAKE128 or id-RSASSA-PSS-SHAKE256 is used,
   respectively.

   The RSASSA-PSS saltLength MUST be 32 bytes for id-RSASSA-PSS-SHAKE128
   or 64 bytes for id-RSASSA-PSS-SHAKE256.  Finally, the trailerField
   MUST be 1, which represents the trailer field with hexadecimal value
   0xBC [RFC8017].

4.2.2.  ECDSA Signatures

   The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is defined in
   [X9.62].  When the id-ecdsa-with-shake128 or id-ecdsa-with-shake256
   (specified in Section 3) algorithm identifier appears, the respective



Kampanakis & Dang       Expires January 22, 2020                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                SHAKEs in CMS                    July 2019


   SHAKE function is used as the hash.  The encoding MUST omit the
   parameters field.  That is, the AlgorithmIdentifier SHALL be a
   SEQUENCE of one component, the OID id-ecdsa-with-shake128 or id-
   ecdsa-with-shake256.

   For simplicity and compliance with the ECDSA standard specification,
   the output length of the hash function must be explicitly determined.
   The output length for SHAKE128 or SHAKE256 used in ECDSA MUST be 256
   or 512 bits, respectively.

   Conforming CA implementations that generate ECDSA with SHAKE
   signatures in certificates or CRLs SHOULD generate such signatures
   with a deterministically generated, non-random k in accordance with
   all the requirements specified in [RFC6979].  They MAY also generate
   such signatures in accordance with all other recommendations in
   [X9.62] or [SEC1] if they have a stated policy that requires
   conformance to those standards.  Those standards have not specified
   SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 as hash algorithm options.  However, SHAKE128
   and SHAKE256 with output length being 32 and 64 octets, respectively
   can be used instead of 256 and 512-bit output hash algorithms such as
   SHA256 and SHA512.

4.3.  Public Keys

   In CMS, the signer's public key algorithm identifiers are located in
   the OriginatorPublicKey's algorithm attribute.  The conventions and
   encoding for RSASSA-PSS and ECDSA public keys algorithm identifiers
   are as specified in Section 2.3 of [RFC3279], Section 3.1 of
   [RFC4055] and Section 2.1 of [RFC5480].

   Traditionally, the rsaEncryption object identifier is used to
   identify RSA public keys.  The rsaEncryption object identifier
   continues to identify the public key when the RSA private key owner
   does not wish to limit the use of the public key exclusively to
   RSASSA-PSS with SHAKEs.  When the RSA private key owner wishes to
   limit the use of the public key exclusively to RSASSA-PSS, the
   AlgorithmIdentifier for RSASSA-PSS defined in Section 3 SHOULD be
   used as the algorithm attribute in the OriginatorPublicKey sequence.
   Conforming client implementations that process RSASSA-PSS with SHAKE
   public keys in CMS message MUST recognize the corresponding OIDs in
   Section 3.

   Conforming implementations MUST specify and process the algorithms
   explicitly by using the OIDs specified in Section 3 when encoding
   ECDSA with SHAKE public keys in CMS messages.

   The identifier parameters, as explained in Section 3, MUST be absent.

Internet-Draft                SHAKEs in CMS                    July 2019


4.4.  Message Authentication Codes

   KMAC message authentication code (KMAC) is specified in [SP800-185].
   In CMS, KMAC algorithm identifiers are located in the
   AuthenticatedData macAlgorithm field.  The KMAC values are located in
   the AuthenticatedData mac field.

   When the id-KmacWithSHAKE128 or id-KmacWithSHAKE256 OID is used as
   the MAC algorithm identifier, the parameters field is optional
   (absent or present).  If absent, the SHAKE256 output length used in
   KMAC is 256 or 512 bits, respectively, and the customization string
   is an empty string by default.

   Conforming implementations that process KMACs with the SHAKEs when
   processing CMS data MUST recognize these identifiers.

   When calculating the KMAC output, the variable N is 0xD2B282C2, S is
   an empty string, and L, the integer representing the requested output
   length in bits, is 256 or 512 for KmacWithSHAKE128 or
   KmacWithSHAKE256, respectively, in this specification.

5.  IANA Considerations

   requested for the SMI Security for S/MIME Module Identifiers

6.  Security Considerations

   This document updates [RFC3370].  The security considerations section
   of that document applies to this specification as well.

   NIST has defined appropriate use of the hash functions in terms of
   the algorithm strengths and expected time frames for secure use in
   Special Publications (SPs) [SP800-78-4] and [SP800-107].  These
   documents can be used as guides to choose appropriate key sizes for
   various security scenarios.

   SHAKE128 with output length of 256-bits offers 128-bits of collision
   and 256-bits of preimage resistance.  Thus, SHAKE128 OIDs in this
   specification are RECOMMENDED with 2048 (112-bit security) or
   3072-bit (128-bit security) RSA modulus or curves with group order of

   256-bits (128-bit security).  SHAKE256 with 512-bits output length
   offers 256-bits of collision and 512-bits of preimage resistance.
   Thus, the SHAKE256 OIDs in this specification are RECOMMENDED with
   4096-bit RSA modulus or higher or curves with group order of 384-bits
   (256-bit security) or higher.  Note that we recommended 4096-bit RSA
   because we would need 15360-bit modulus for 256-bits of security
   which is impractical for today's technology.

   When more than two parties share the same message-authentication key,
   data origin authentication is not provided.  Any party that knows the
   message-authentication key can compute a valid MAC, therefore the
   content could originate from any one of the parties.

7.  Acknowledgements

   This document is based on Russ Housley's draft
   [I-D.housley-lamps-cms-sha3-hash].  It replaces SHA3 hash functions
   by SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 as the LAMPS WG agreed.

   The authors would like to thank Russ Housley for his guidance and
   very valuable contributions with the ASN.1 module.  Valuable feedback
   was also provided by Eric Rescorla.
