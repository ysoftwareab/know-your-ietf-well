Internet-Draft       Pending Additions Event Package       February 2008


1.  Introduction

   The framework for consent-based communications in SIP
   [I-D.ietf-sip-consent-framework] identifies the need for users
   manipulating the translation logic at a relay (e.g., adding a new
   recipient) to be informed about the consent-related status of the
   recipients of a given translation.  That is, the user manipulating
   the translation logic needs to know which recipients have given the
   relay permission to send them SIP requests.

   This document defines a SIP event package whereby user agents can
   subscribe to the consent-related state of the resources that are
   being added to a resource list that defines a translation.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Relay:  Any SIP server, be it a proxy, B2BUA (Back-to-Back User
      Agent), or some hybrid, that receives a request, translates its
      Request-URI into one or more next-hop URIs (i.e., recipient URIs),
      and delivers the request to those URIs.


3.  Overview of Operation

   A user agent subscribes to a relay using the Pending Additions event
   package.  NOTIFY requests within this event package can carry an XML
   document in the "application/resource-lists+xml" format [RFC4826] or
   in the "application/resource-lists-diff+xml" format, which is based
   on XML patch operations [I-D.ietf-simple-xml-patch-ops].

   A document in the "application/resource-lists+xml" format provides
   the user agent with the whole list of resources being added to a
   resource list along with the consent-related status of those
   resources.  A document in the "application/resource-lists-diff+xml"
   format provides the user agent with the changes the list of resources
   being added has experimented since the last notification sent to the
   user agent.


4.  XML Schema Definition

   This section defines the <consent-status> element, which provides
   consent-related information about a resource to be added to a relay's



Camarillo                Expires August 18, 2008                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft       Pending Additions Event Package       February 2008


   translation logic.

   A consent-status document is an XML document that MUST be well-formed
   and SHOULD be valid.  Consent-status documents MUST be based on XML
   1.0 and MUST be encoded using UTF-8.  This specification makes use of
   XML namespaces for identifying consent-status documents.  The
   namespace URI for elements defined for this purpose is a URN, using
   the namespace identifier 'ietf'.  This URN is:


       urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:consent-status



   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <xs:schema targetNamespace="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:consent-status"
     elementFormDefault="qualified"
     attributeFormDefault="unqualified"
     xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
     xmlns:tns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:consent-status">
      <xs:element name="consent-status">
         <xs:simpleType>
           <xs:restriction base="xs:string">
             <xs:enumeration value="pending"/>
             <xs:enumeration value="waiting"/>
             <xs:enumeration value="error"/>
             <xs:enumeration value="denied"/>
             <xs:enumeration value="granted"/>
           </xs:restriction>
         </xs:simpleType>
      </xs:element>
   </xs:schema>

   The <consent-status> element can take on the following values:

   Pending:  the relay has received a request to add a resource to its
      translation logic and will ask for permission to do so.

   Waiting:  the relay has requested permission to add the resource to
      its translation logic but has not gotten any answer from the
      resource yet.

   Error:  the relay has requested permission to add the resource to its
      translation logic and has received an error response (e.g., a SIP
      error response to the MESSAGE request send to request permission).
      That is, the permission document requesting permission could not
      be delivered to the resource.

Internet-Draft       Pending Additions Event Package       February 2008


   Denied:  the resource has denied the relay permission to add the
      resource to the relay's translation logic.

   Granted:  the resource has granted the relay permission to add the
      resource to the relay's translation logic.

   Section 5.1.11 contains an example of an "application/
   resource-lists+xml" document that carries consent-related state
   information using <consent-status> elements.


5.  Pending Additions Event Package Definition

   This section provides the details for defining a SIP [RFC3261] event
   notification package, as specified by [RFC3265].

5.1.  Event Package Name

   The name of this event package is "consent-pending-additions".  This
   package name is carried in the Event and Allow-Events header, as
   defined in [RFC3265].

5.1.1.  Event Package Parameters

   This package does not define any event package parameters.

5.1.2.  SUBSCRIBE Bodies

   A SUBSCRIBE for Pending Additions events MAY contain a body.  This
   body would serve the purpose of filtering the subscription.  The
   definition of such a body is outside the scope of this specification.

   A SUBSCRIBE for the Pending Additions event package MAY be sent
   without a body.  This implies that the default session policy
   filtering policy has been requested.  The default policy is that
   notifications are generated every time there is any change in the
   state of a resource in the list.

5.1.3.  Subscription Duration

   The default expiration time for a subscription is one hour (3600
   seconds).

5.1.4.  NOTIFY Bodies

   In this event package, the body of the notifications contains a
   resource list document.  This document describes the resources being
   added as recipients to a translation operation.  All subscribers and



Camarillo                Expires August 18, 2008                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft       Pending Additions Event Package       February 2008


   notifiers MUST support the "application/resource-lists+xml" data
   format [RFC4826] and its extension to carry consent-related state
   information, which is specified in Section 4.  The SUBSCRIBE request
   MAY contain an Accept header field.  If no such header field is
   present, it has a default value of "application/resource-lists+xml".
   If the header field is present, it MUST include "application/
   resource-lists+xml", and MAY include any other types capable of
   representing consent-related state.

   Additionally, all subscribers and notifiers SHOULD support the
   "application/resource-lists-diff+xml" format.  Section 6 discusses
   the usage of the Pending Additions event package with this format.

5.1.5.  Notifier Processing of SUBSCRIBE Requests

   The state of the resources to be added to a relay's translation logic
   can reveal sensitive information.  Therefore, all subscriptions
   SHOULD be authenticated and then authorized before approval.
   Authorization policy is at the discretion of the administrator.

5.1.6.  Notifier Generation of NOTIFY Requests

   A notifier for the Pending Additions event package SHOULD include the
   <consent-status> element, which is defined in Section 4.  The
   <consent-status> element MUST be positioned as an instance of the
   <any> element within the <entry> element.

   Notifications SHOULD be generated for the Pending Additions package
   whenever there is a change in the consent-related state of a
   resource.  When a resource moves to the error, denied, or granted
   states, and once a NOTIFY request is sent, the resource is removed
   from further notifications.

5.1.7.  Subscriber Processing of NOTIFY Requests

   NOTIFY requests contain full state.  The subscriber does not need to
   perform any type of information aggregation.  Section 6 discusses the
   use of the Pending Additions event package with partial
   notifications.

5.1.8.  Handling of Forked Requests

   The state of a given resource list is normally handled by a server
   and stored in a repository.  Therefore, there is usually a single
   place where the resource-list state is resident.  This implies that a
   subscription for this information is readily handled by a single
   element with access to this repository.  There is, therefore, no
   compelling need for a subscription to pending additions information



Camarillo                Expires August 18, 2008                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft       Pending Additions Event Package       February 2008


   to fork.  As a result, a subscriber MUST NOT create multiple dialogs
   as a result of a single subscription request.  The required
   processing to guarantee that only a single dialog is established is
   described in Section 4.4.9 of [RFC3265].

5.1.9.  Rate of Notifications

   For reasons of congestion control, it is important that the rate of
   notifications not become excessive.  As a result, it is RECOMMENDED
   that the server does not generate notifications for a single
   subscriber at a rate faster than once every 5 seconds.

5.1.10.  State Agents

   State agents have no role in the handling of this package.

5.1.11.  Example

   The following is an example of an "application/resource-lists+xml"
   document that carries consent-related state information using
   <consent-status> elements:


      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <resource-lists xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:resource-lists"
       xmlns:cs="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:consent-status">
       <list>
        <entry uri="sip:bill@example.com">
         <display-name>Bill Doe</display-name>
         <cs:consent-status>pending</cs:consent-status>
        </entry>
        <entry uri="sip:joe@example.com">
         <display-name>Joe Smith</display-name>
         <cs:consent-status>pending</cs:consent-status>
        </entry>
        <entry uri="sip:nancy@example.com">
         <display-name>Nancy Gross</display-name>
         <cs:consent-status>granted</cs:consent-status>
        </entry>
       </list>
      </resource-lists>


6.  Partial Notifications

   The lists of resources reported by this event package may contain
   many resources.  When the "application/resource-lists+xml" format is
   used and there is a change in the consent-related status of a



Camarillo                Expires August 18, 2008                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft       Pending Additions Event Package       February 2008


   resource, the server generates a notification with the whole list.
   Generating large notifications to report small changes does not meet
   the efficiency requirements of some bandwidth-constrained
   environments.  The partial notifications mechanism specified in this
   section is a more efficient way to report changes in the status of
   resources.

   Subscribers signal support for partial notifications by including the
   "application/resource-lists-diff+xml" format in the Accept header
   field of the SUBSCRIBE requests they generate.  If a client
   subscribing to the Pending Additions event package generates an
   Accept header field that includes the MIME type "application/
   resource-lists-diff+xml", the server has the option of returning
   documents in this format (instead of in the "application/
   resource-list+xml" format).

6.1.  Generation of Partial Notifications

   Once a subscription is accepted and installed, the server MUST
   deliver full state in its first notification.  To report full state,
   the server uses the regular format for resource lists.  Consequently,
   the server MUST set the Content-Type header field to the value
   'application/resource-lists+xml'.

   In order to deliver a partial notification, the server MUST set the
   Content-Type header field to the value 'application/
   resource-lists-diff+xml'.  When the server generates a partial
   notification, the server SHOULD only include the information that has
   changed compared to the previous notification.  It is up to the
   server's local policy to determine what is considered as a change to
   the previous state.

   The server MUST construct partial notifications according to the
   following logic: all the information that has been added to the
   document is listed inside <add> elements.  All information that has
   been removed from the document is listed inside <remove> elements and
   all information that has been changed is listed under <replace>
   elements.

   The server MUST NOT send a new NOTIFY request with a partial
   notification until it has received a final response from the
   subscriber for the previous one or the previous NOTIFY request has
   timed out.

   When the server receives a SUBSCRIBE request (refresh or termination)
   within the associated subscription, it SHOULD send a NOTIFY request
   containing the full document using the 'application/
   resource-lists+xml' content type.

Internet-Draft       Pending Additions Event Package       February 2008


   If the server has used a content type other than 'application/
   resource-lists+xml' in notifications within the existing subscription
   and changes to deliver partial notifications, the server MUST deliver
   full state using the 'application/resource-lists+xml' content type
   before generating its first partial notification.

6.2.  Processing of Partial Notifications

   When a subscriber receives the first notification containing full
   state in a 'application/resource-lists+xml' MIME body, the subscriber
   MUST store the received full document as its local copy.

   When the subscriber receives a subsequent notification, the
   subscriber MUST modify its locally-stored information according to
   the following logic:

   o  If the notification carries a 'application/resource-lists+xml'
      document, the subscriber MUST replace its local copy of the
      document with the document received in notification.

   o  If the notification carries a 'application/
      resource-lists-diff+xml' document, the subscriber MUST apply the
      changes indicated in the received 'application/
      resource-lists-diff+xml' document to its local copy of the full
      document.

   If subscriber encounters a processing error while processing a
   'application/resource-lists-diff+xml' encoded document, the
   subscriber SHOULD renew its subscription.  A subscriber can fall back
   to normal operations by not including the "application/
   resource-list-diff+xml' format in a new SUBSCRIBE request.

   If the server changes the content type used in notifications within
   the existing subscription, the subscriber MUST discard all the
   previously received information and process the new content as
   specified for that content type.

6.3.  XML Schema for Partial Notifications

   This is the XML schema for the "application/resource-lists-diff+xml"
   data format.  The "urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:xml-patch-ops" schema
   is defined in [I-D.ietf-simple-xml-patch-ops].

6.4.  Examples

   Section 5.1.11 contains and example of an 'application/
   resource-lists+xml' document, which carries full state.  The
   following is an 'application/resource-lists-diff+xml' partial update
   document:


   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <resource-lists-diff xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:resource-lists"
    xmlns:cs="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:consent-status">

  <replace
sel="*/list/entry[@uri='sip:bill@example.com']/cs:consent-status/text()"
  >granted</replace>

   </resource-lists-diff>


   The following is the resulting 'application/resource-lists+xml'
   document after applying the partial update:


      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <resource-lists xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:resource-lists"
       xmlns:cs="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:consent-status">
       <list>
        <entry uri="sip:bill@example.com">
         <display-name>Bill Doe</display-name>
         <cs:consent-status>granted</cs:consent-status>
        </entry>
        <entry uri="sip:joe@example.com">
         <display-name>Joe Smith</display-name>
         <cs:consent-status>pending</cs:consent-status>
        </entry>
        <entry uri="sip:nancy@example.com">
         <display-name>Nancy Gross</display-name>
         <cs:consent-status>granted</cs:consent-status>

8.  Security Considerations

   The Framework for Consent-based Communications in the Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) [I-D.ietf-sip-consent-framework] discusses
   security-related issues that are related to this specification.

   Subscriptions to the Pending Additions even package can reveal
   sensitive information.  For this reason, it is RECOMMENDED that
   relays use strong means for authentication and information
   confidentiality.  Additionally, attackers may attempt to modify the
   contents of the notifications sent by a relay to its subscribers.
   Consequently, it is RECOMMENDED that relays use a strong means for
   information integrity protection.

   It is RECOMMENDED that relays authenticate subscribers using the
   normal SIP authentication mechanisms, such as Digest, as defined in
   [RFC3261].

   The mechanism used for conveying information to subscribers SHOULD
   ensure the integrity and confidentially of the information.  In order
   to achieve these, an end-to-end SIP encryption mechanism, such as
   S/MIME, as described in [RFC3261], SHOULD be used.

   If strong end-to-end security means (such as above) is not available,
   it is RECOMMENDED that hop-by-hop security based on TLS and SIPS
   URIs, as described in [RFC3261], is used.
