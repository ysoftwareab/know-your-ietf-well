1.  Introduction

   Many applications are distributed in nature, and their performance
   may be impacted by a IP impairments, server capacity, congestion and
   other factors.  It is important to measure the performance of
   applications and services to ensure that quality objectives are being
   met and to support problem diagnosis.  Standardized metrics help to
   ensure that performance measurement is implemented consistently and
   to facilitate interpretation and comparison.

   There are at least three phases in the development of performance
   standards.  They are:

   1.  Definition of a Performance Metric and its units of measure

   2.  Specification of a Method of Measurement

Clark                                                          [Page  2]

Metrics Framework                                        2 November 2008


   3.  Specification of the Reporting Format

   During the development of metrics it is often useful to define
   performance objectives and expected value ranges however this is not
   defined as part of the metric specification.

   This memo refers to a Performance Metrics Entity, or PM Entity, which
   may in future be a working group or directorate or a combination of
   these two.

1.1.  Background and Motivation

   Although the IETF has two active Working Groups dedicated to the
   development of performance metrics, they each have strict limitations
   in their charters:

   - The Benchmarking Methodology WG has addressed a range of networking
   technologies and protocols in their long history (such as IEEE 802.3,
   ATM, Frame Relay, and Routing Protocols), but the charter strictly
   limits their performance characterizations to the laboratory
   environment.

   - The IP Performance Metrics WG has the mandate to develop metrics
   applicable to live IP networks, but it is specifically prohibited
   from developing metrics that characterize traffic (such as a VoIP
   stream).

   A BOF held at IETF-69 introduced the IETF community to the
   possibility of a generalized activity to define standardized
   performance metrics.  The existence of a growing list of Internet-
   Drafts on performance metrics (with community interest in
   development, but in un-chartered areas) illustrates the need for
   additional performance work.  The majority of people present at the
   BOF supported the proposition that IETF should be working in these
   areas, and no one objected to any of the proposals.

   The IETF does have current and completed activities related to the
   reporting of application performance metrics (e.g.  RAQMON) and is
   also actively involved in the development of reliable transport
   protocols which would affect the relationship between IP performance
   and application performance.

   Thus there is a gap in the currently chartered coverage of IETF WGs:
   development of performance metrics for non-IP-layer protocols that
   can be used to characterize performance on live networks.

1.2.  Organization of this memo

   This memo is divided in two major sections beyond the Purpose and
   Scope section.  The first is a definition and description of a
   performance metric and its key aspects.  The second defines a process
   to develop these metrics that is applicable to the IETF environment.

Clark                                                          [Page  3]

2.  Purpose and Scope

   The purpose of this memo is to define a framework and a process for
   developing performance metrics for IP-based applications that operate
   over reliable or datagram transport protocols, and that can be used
   to characterize traffic on live networks and services.

   The scope of this memo includes the support of metric definition for
   any protocol developed by the IETF, however this memo is not intended
   to supercede existing working methods within WGs that have existing
   chartered work in this area.

   This process is not intended to govern performance metric development
   in existing IETF WG that are focused on metrics development, such as
   IPPM and BMWG.  However, the framework and guidelines may be useful
   in these activities, and MAY be applied where appropriate.


3.  Metrics Development

   This section provides key definitions and qualifications of
   performance metrics.

3.1.  Audience for Metrics

   Metrics are intended for use in measuring the performance of an
   application, network or service.  A key first step in metric
   definition is to identify what metrics are needed by the "user" in
   order to properly maintain service quality and to identify and
   quantify problems, i.e. to consider the audience for the metrics.

3.2.  Definitions of a Metric

   A metric is a measure of an observable behavior of an application,
   protocol or other system.  The definition of a metric often assumes
   some implicit or explicit underlying statistical process, and a
   metric is an estimate of a parameter of this process.  If the assumed
   statistical process closely models the behavior of the system then
   the metric is "better" in the sense that it more accurately
   characterizes the state or behavior of the system.

   A metric should serve some defined purpose.  This may include the
   measurement of capacity, quantifying how bad some problem is,
   measurement of service level, problem diagnosis or location and other
   such uses.  A metric may also be an input to some other process, for
   example the computation of a composite metric or a model or
   simulation of a system.  Tests of the "usefulness" of a metric
   include:

      (i) the degree to which its absence would cause significant loss
      of information on the behavior or state of the application or

Clark                                                          [Page  4]

Metrics Framework                                        2 November 2008

      system being measured

      (ii) the correlation between the metric and the quality of service
      / experience delivered to the user (person or other application)

      (iii) the degree to which the metric is able to support the
      identification and location of problems affecting service quality.

   For example, consider a distributed application operating over a
   network connection that is subject to packet loss.  A Packet Loss
   Rate (PLR) metric is defined as the mean packet loss rate over some
   time period.  If the application performs poorly over network
   connections with high packet loss rate and always performs well when
   the packet loss rate is zero then the PLR metric is useful to some
   degree.  Some applications are sensitive to short periods of high
   loss (bursty loss) and are relatively insensitive to isolated packet
   loss events; for this type of application there would be very weak
   correlation between PLR and application performance.  A "better"
   metric would consider both the packet loss rate and the distribution
   of loss events.  If application performance is degraded when the PLR
   exceeds some rate then a useful metric may be a measure of the
   duration and frequency of periods during which the PLR exceeds that
   rate.

3.3.  Computed Metrics

3.3.1 Composed Metrics

   Some metrics may not be measured directly, but may be composed from
   metrics that have been measured.  Usually the contribution metrics
   have a limited scope in time or space, and they can be combined to
   estimate the performance of some larger entity.  Some examples of
   composed metrics and composed metric definitions are:

   Spatial Composition is defined as the composition of metrics of the
   same type with differing spatial domains [Ref ?].  For spatially
   composed metrics to be meaningful, the spatial domains should be non-
   overlapping and contiguous, and the composition operation should be
   mathematically appropriate for the type of metric.

   Temporal Composition is defined as the composition of sets of metrics
   of the same type with differing time spans [Ref ?].  For temporally
   composed metrics to be meaningful, the time spans should be
   non-overlapping and contiguous, and the composition operation should
   be mathematically appropriate for the type of metric.

   Temporal Aggregation is a summarization of metrics into a smaller
   number of metrics, each of which has a greater time span than the
   original metrics.  An example would be to compute the minimum,
   maximum and average values of a series of time sampled values of a
   metric.

3.3.2 Index (from compagg)

Clark                                                          [Page  5]

Metrics Framework                                        2 November 2008

 
   An Index is a metric for which the output value range has been
   selected for convenience or clarity, and the behavior of which is
   selected to support ease of understanding.  The deterministic
   function for an index is often developed after the index range and
   index behavior have been determined. 

3.4.  Metric Specification

3.4.1.  Outline

   A metric definition MUST have a normative part that defines what the
   metric is and how it is measured or computed and SHOULD have an
   informative part that describes the metric and its application.

3.4.2.  Normative parts of metric definition

   The normative part of a metric definition MUST define at least the
   following:

   (i) Metric Name

   Metric names MUST be unique within the set of metrics being defined
   and MAY be descriptive.

   (ii) Metric Description

   The description MUST explain what the metric is, what is being
   measured and how this relates to the performance of the system being
   measured.

   (iii) Measurement Method

   This MUST define what is being measured, estimated or computed and
   the specific algorithm to be used.  Terms such as "average" should be
   qualified (e.g. running average or average over some interval).  It
   is important to also define exception cases and how these are
   handled.  For example, there are a number of commonly used metrics
   related to packet loss; these often don't define the criteria by
   which a packet is determined to be lost (vs very delayed) or how
   duplicate packets are handled.  For example, if the average packet
   loss rate during a time interval is reported, and a packet's arrival
   is delayed from one interval to the next then was it "lost" during
   the interval during which it should have arrived or should it be
   counted as received?

   (iv) Units of measurement

   The units of measurement must be clearly stated.

   (v) Measurement timing

   The acceptable range of timing intervals or sampling intervals for a

Clark                                                          [Page  6]

Metrics Framework                                        2 November 2008

   measurement and the timing accuracy required for such intervals must
   be specified.  Short intervals or frequent sampling provides a richer
   source of information that can be helpful in assessing application
   performance however can lead to excessive measurement data.  Long
   measurement or sampling intervals reduce that amount of reported and
   collected data however may be insufficient to truly understand
   application performance or service quality if this varies with time.

  (vi) Measurement Point
   If the measurement is specific to a measurement point this should be
   defined.

3.4.3.  Informative parts of metric definition

   The informative part of a metric specification is intended to support
   the implementation and use of the metric.  This part SHOULD provide
   the following data: 

   (i) Implementation 
   The implementation description may be in the form of text, algorithm
   or example software.  The objective of this part of the metric
   definition is to assist implementers to achieve a consistent result.

   (ii) Verification
   The metric definition SHOULD provide guidance on verification
   testing. This may be in the form of test vectors, a formal
   verification test method or informal advice.

   (iii) Use and Applications 

   The Use and Applications description is intended to assist the "user"
   to understand how, when and where the metric can be applied, and what
   significance the value range for the metric may have.  This MAY
   include a definition of the "typical" and "abnormal" range of the
   metric, if this was not apparent from the nature of the metric.
   For example: 

        (a) it is fairly intuitive that a lower packet loss rate
         would equate to better performance however the user may
         not know the significance of some given packet loss rate, 

        (b) the speech level of a telephone signal is commonly expressed
         in dBm0.  If the user is presented with:

                  Speech level = -7 dBm0 

         this is not intuitively understandable, unless the user is a
         telephony expert.  If the metric definition explains that the
         typical range is -18 to -28 dBm0, a value higher than -18
         means the signal may be too high (loud) and less than -28
         means that the signal may be too low (quiet), it is much
         easier to interpret the metric.

  (iv) Reporting Model

   The Reporting Model definition is intended to make any relationship
   between the metric and the reporting model clear. There are often
   implied relationships between the method of reporting metrics and the
   metric itself, however these are often not made apparent to the
   implementor. For example, if the metric is a short term running
   average packet delay variation (e.g.  PPDV as defined in RFC3550)
   however this value is reported at intervals of 6-10 seconds
   this results in a sampling model which may have limited accuracy if
   packet delay variation is non-stationary.

   Example definition

   Metric Name: BurstPacketLossFrequency

   Metric Description: A burst of packet loss is defined as a longest
   period starting and ending with lost packets during which no more
   than Gmin consecutive packets are received.  The
   BurstPacketLossFrequency is defined as the number of bursts of packet
   loss occurring during a specified time interval (e.g. per minute, per
   hour, per day).  If Gmin is set to 0 then a burst of packet loss
   would comprise only consecutive lost packets, whereas a Gmin of 16
   would define bursts as periods of both lost and received packets
   (sparse bursts) having a loss rate of greater than 5.9%.

   Measurement Method: Bursts may be detected using the Markov Model
   algorithm defined in RFC3611.  The BurstPacketLossFrequency is

Clark                                                          [Page  8]

Metrics Framework                                        2 November 2008

   calculated by counting the number of burst events within the defined
   measurement interval.  A burst that spans the boundary between two
   time intervals shall be counted within the later of the two
   intervals.

   Units of Measurement: Bursts per time interval (e.g. per second, per
   hour, per day)

   Measurement Timing: This metric can be used over a wide range of time
   intervals.  Using time intervals of longer than one hour may prevent
   the detection of variations in the value of this metric due to time-
   of-day load network load changes.  Timing intervals should not vary
   in duration by more than +/- 2%.

   Implementation Guidelines: See RFC3611.

   Conformance Testing: See Appendix for C code to generate test
   vectors.

   Use and Applications: This metric is useful to detect IP network
   transient problems that affect the quality of applications such as
   Voice over IP or IP Video.  The value of Gmin may be selected to
   ensure that bursts correspond to a packet loss rate that would
   degrade the performance of the application of interest (e.g. 16 for
   VoIP).

   Reporting Model: This metric needs to be associated with a defined
   time interval, which could be defined by fixed intervals or by a
   sliding window.

3.5.  Dependencies

3.5.1.  Timing accuracy

   The accuracy of the timing of a measurement may affect the accuracy
   of the metric.  This may not materially affect a sampled value metric
   however would affect an interval based metric.  Some metrics, for
   example the number of events per time interval, would be directly
   affected; for example a 10 percent variation in time interval would
   lead directly to a 10 percent variation in the measured value.  Other
   metrics, such as the average packet loss rate during some time
   interval, would be affected to a lesser extent.

   If it is necessary to correlate sampled values or intervals then it
   is essential that the accuracy of sampling time and interval start/
   stop times is sufficient for the application (for example +/- 2%).

3.5.2.  Dependencies of metric definitions on related events or metrics

   Metric definitions may explicitly or implicitly rely on factors that
   may not be obvious.  For example, the recognition of a packet as
   being "lost" relies on having some method to know the packet was
   actually lost (e.g.  RTP sequence number), and some time threshold

Clark                                                          [Page  9]

Metrics Framework                                        2 November 2008

   after which a non-received packet is declared as lost.  It is
   important that any such dependencies are recognized and incorporated
   into the metric definition.

3.5.3.  Relationship between application performance and lower layer
        metrics

   Lower layer metrics may be used to compute or infer the performance
   of higher layer applications, potentially using an application
   performance model.  The accuracy of this will depend on many factors
   including:

   (i) The completeness of the set of metrics - i.e. are there metrics
   for all the input values to the application performance model?

   (ii) Correlation between input variables (being measured) and
   application performance

   (iii) Variability in the measured metrics and how this variability
   affects application performance


4.  Performance Metric Development Process

4.1.  New Proposals for Metrics

   The following entry criteria will be considered for each proposal.

   Proposals SHOULD be prepared as Internet Drafts, describing the
   metrics and conforming to the qualifications above as much as
   possible.

   Proposals SHOULD be vetted by the corresponding protocol development
   Working Group prior to discussion by the PM Entity.  This aspect of
   the process includes an assessment of the need for the metrics
   proposed and assessment of the support for their development in IETF.

   Proposals SHOULD include an assessment of interaction and/or overlap
   with work in other Standards Development Organizations.

   Proposals SHOULD specify the intended audience and users of the
   metrics.  The development process encourages participation by members
   of the intended audience.

   Proposals SHOULD survey the existing standards work in the area and
   identify additional expertise that might be consulted, or possible
   overlap with other standards development orgs.

   Proposals SHOULD identify any security and IANA requirements.
   Security issues could potentially involve revealing of user
   identifying data or the potential misuse of active test tools.  IANA
   considerations may involve the need for a metrics registry.

4.2.  Reviewing Metrics

   Each metric SHOULD be assessed according to the following list of
   qualifications:

   o  Unambiguously defined?

   o  Units of Measure Specified?

   o  Measurement Interval Specified?

   o  Measurement Errors Identified?

   o  Repeatable?

   o  Implementable?

   o  Correlation with application performance/ user experience?

4.3.  Proposal Approval

  New work item proposals SHALL be approved using the existing IETF
  process.

4.4.  PM Entity Interaction with other WGs

   The PM Entity SHALL work in partnership with the related protocol
   development WG when considering an Internet Draft that specifies
   performance metrics for a protocol.  A sufficient number of
   individuals with expertise must be willing to consult on the draft.
   If the related WG has concluded, comments on the proposal should
   still be sought from key RFC authors and former chairs, or from the
   WG mailing list if it was not closed.

   Existing mailing lists SHOULD be used however a dedicated mailing
   list MAY be initiated if necessary to facilitate work on a draft.

   In some cases, it will be appropriate to have the IETF session
   discussion during the related protocol WG session, to maximize
   visibility of the effort to that WG and expand the review.

4.5.  Standards Track Performance Metrics

   The PM Entity will manage the progression of PM RFCs along the
   Standards Track.  See [I-D.bradner-metricstest].  This may include
   the preparation of test plans to examine different implementations of
   the metrics to ensure that the metric definitions are clear and
   unambiguous (depending on the final form of the draft above).

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


6.  Security Considerations

   In general, the existence of framework for performance metric
   development does not constitute a security issue for the Internet.
   Metric definitions may introduce security issues and this framework
   recommends that those defining metrics should identify any such risk
   factors.

   The security considerations that apply to any active measurement of
   live networks are relevant here as well.  See [RFC4656].
