Abstract

   This document describes a structure for representing trust anchor
   information.  A trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented
   via a public key and associated data.  The public key is used to
   verify digital signatures and the associated data is used to
   constrain the types of information or actions for which the trust
   anchor is authoritative.  The structures defined in this document are
   intended to satisfy the format-related requirements defined in Trust
   Anchor Management Requirements and for use within the context of the
   Trust Anchor Management Protocol (TAMP).

1.  Introduction

   Trust anchors are widely used to verify digital signatures and
   validate certification paths [RFC5280][X.509].  Though widely used,
   there is no standard format for representing trust anchor
   information.  This document describes the TrustAnchorInfo structure.
   This structure is intended to satisfy the format-requirements
   expressed in Trust Anchor Management Requirements
   [I-D.draft-ietf-pkix-ta-mgmt-reqs].  The structure is intended for
   use with the Trust Anchor Management Protocol (TAMP) [TAMP].  It is
   primarily intended to offer a more compact alternative to X.509
   certificates for exchanging trust anchor information and to provide a
   means of associating constraints with certificates without breaking
   the signature on the certificate.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Trust Anchors

   As with TAMP, this specification recognizes three types of trust
   anchors: apex trust anchors, management trust anchors, and identity
   trust anchors.  All trust anchors, regardless of their type, contain
   the following components:

   o  A public key signature algorithm identifier and associated public
      key, which MAY include parameters

   o  A public key identifier

   o  An OPTIONAL human readable trust anchor title

   o  OPTIONAL X.509 certification path controls

   o  OPTIONAL extensions

1.2.1.  Apex Trust Anchors

   Within the context of a single trust anchor store, one trust anchor
   is superior to all others.  This trust anchor is referred to as the
   apex trust anchor.  Typically, this trust anchor is installed during
   initialization of a trust anchor store, with its integrity confirmed
   using manual means.  This trust anchor represents an authority that
   is unconstrained within the context of the trust anchor store.  An
   apex trust anchor may delegate authority to other trust anchors.

Internet-Draft                     TAF                      October 2008


   The apex trust anchor private key is expected to be controlled by an
   entity with information assurance responsibility for the trust anchor
   store.  The apex trust anchor is by definition unconstrained and
   therefore does not have explicit authorization information associated
   with it.  In order to make processing of management messages as
   uniform as possible, the apex trust anchor has an implicit OID
   associated with it that represents the special anyContentType value.
   This OID will be used as input to processing algorithms to represent
   the apex trust anchor authorization.

   The apex trust anchor has a different structure than other trust
   anchors; it MAY include two public keys.  Whenever the apex trust
   anchor is updated, both public keys are replaced.  The first public
   key, called the operational public key, is used in the same manner as
   other trust anchors.  The second public key, called the contingency
   public key, can only be used to update the apex trust anchor.  The
   contingency private key SHOULD be used at only one point in time; it
   is used only to sign a message which results in its own replacement
   (as well as the replacement of the operational public key).  The
   contingency public key is distributed in encrypted form.  When the
   contingency public key is used, the symmetric key needed to decrypt
   the contingency public key must be provided, ideally as part of the
   message that is to be verified with the contingency public key.  When
   an apex trust anchor that contains a contingency key is replaced with
   an apex trust anchor that does not contain a contingency key, the
   contingency key of the old apex trust anchor is deleted, or replaced
   with an empty object.

1.2.2.  Management Trust Anchors

   Management trust anchors are used to verify and authorize selected
   digitally signed objects.  Typically, these objects are protected
   using the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [RFC3852] and contain
   payloads used to manage some aspect of the device hosting the trust
   anchor store containing the management trust anchor.  For example,
   TAMP messages are validated to a management trust anchor.  Similarly,
   a signed firmware package as specified in [RFC4108] is validated to a
   management trust anchor.

   Authorization checking is required for management messages.  These
   checks are based on the content type of the management message.
   Management trust anchors include a list of object identifiers (OIDs)
   that name authorized content types along with OPTIONAL constraints.
   The authorization mechanism used within the TrustAnchorInfo structure
   for management trust anchors is described in [CCC].

   A management trust anchor may be used directly to verify and
   authorize a signed object, or may be used to validate a certification

   path terminated by a certificate containing the public key used to
   verify a digitally signed object.

1.2.3.  Identity Trust Anchors

   Identity trust anchors are used to validate certification paths, and
   they represent a trust anchor for a public key infrastructure.  They
   are most often used in the validation of certificates associated with
   non-management applications.

2.  Trust Anchor Information Syntax

   This section describes the TrustAnchorInfo structure.


   TrustAnchorInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
      version   [0] TrustAnchorInfoVersion DEFAULT v2,
      pubKey    PublicKeyInfo,
      keyId     KeyIdentifier,
      taType    TrustAnchorType,
      taTitle   TrustAnchorTitle OPTIONAL,
      certPath  CertPathControls OPTIONAL,
      exts      [3] Extensions OPTIONAL  }

   TrustAnchorInfoVersion ::= INTEGER { v1(1), v2(2), v3(3) }

   PublicKeyInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
      algorithm  AlgorithmIdentifier,
      publicKey  BIT STRING }

   KeyIdentifier ::= OCTET STRING



2.1.  Version

   version identifies the version of TrustAnchorInfo.  Where the exts
   field is present or the TrustAnchorType.apex option is used but the
   ApexTrustAnchorInfo.continPubKey is omitted, v3 MUST be used.  In all
   other cases, v2 MAY be used.

2.2.  Public Key

   pubKey identifies the public key and algorithm associated with the
   trust anchor using the PublicKeyInfo structure.  The PublicKeyInfo
   structure contains the algorithm identifier followed by the public
   key itself.  The algorithm field is an AlgorithmIdentifier, which
   contains an object identifier and OPTIONAL parameters.  The object
   identifier names the public key algorithm and indicates the syntax of
   the parameters, if present, as well as the format of the public key.
   The public key is encoded as a BIT STRING.  For the apex trust
   anchor, this field contains the operational public key.

2.3.  Key Identitifer

   keyId contains the public key identifier of the trust anchor public
   key.  For the apex trust anchor, this field contains the public key
   identifier of the operational public key.

2.4.  Trust Anchor Type



       TrustAnchorType ::= CHOICE {
         apex   [0] ApexTrustAnchorInfo,
         mgmt   [1] MgmtTrustAnchorInfo,
         ident  [2] NULL }



   taType indicates the type of trust anchor, and it carries information
   specific to the type of trust anchor that is being represented.  If
   an apex trust anchor is represented, then apex trust anchor
   information is carried using the ApexTrustAnchorInfo structure.  If a
   management trust anchor is represented, then management trust anchor
   information is carried using the MgmtTrustAnchorInfo structure.  If
   an identity trust anchor is represented, no additional information is
   carried.



    ApexTrustAnchorInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
      continPubKey  ApexContingencyKey OPTIONAL,
      tampSeqNum        SeqNumber OPTIONAL }

    ApexContingencyKey ::= SEQUENCE {
      wrapAlgorithm        AlgorithmIdentifier,
      wrappedContinPubKey  OCTET STRING }

    SeqNumber ::= INTEGER (0..9223372036854775807)



   The fields of ApexTrustAnchorInfo are used as follows:

   o  continPubKey contains the optional encrypted apex trust anchor
      contingency public key using the ApexContingencyKey structure.

   o  tampSeqNum is OPTIONAL.  This field has been deprecated.  TAMP
      [TAMP] provides sequence number propagation and processing
      details.

   The fields of ApexContingencyKey are used as follows:

   o  wrapAlgorithm identifies the symmetric algorithm used to encrypt
      the apex trust anchor contingency public key.  If this public key
      is ever needed, the symmetric key needed to decrypt it will be

      provided in the message that is to be validated using it.  The
      algorithm identifier is an AlgorithmIdentifier, which contains an
      object identifier and OPTIONAL parameters.  The object identifier
      indicates the syntax of the parameters, if present.

   o  wrappedContinPubKey is the encrypted apex trust anchor contingency
      public key.  Once decrypted, it yields the PublicKeyInfo
      structure, which consists of the algorithm identifier followed by
      the public key itself.  The algorithm identifier is an
      AlgorithmIdentifier that contains an object identifier and
      OPTIONAL parameters.  The object identifier indicates the format
      of the public key and the syntax of the parameters, if present.
      The public key is encoded as a BIT STRING.




    MgmtTrustAnchorInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
      taUsage  TrustAnchorUsage,
      tampSeqNum   SeqNumber OPTIONAL }

    TrustAnchorUsage ::= CMSContentConstraints

    CMSContentConstraints ::= ContentTypeConstraintList

    ContentTypeConstraintList ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF
                              ContentTypeConstraint

    ContentTypeConstraint ::= SEQUENCE {
      contentType      ContentType,
      canSource        BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
      attrConstraints  AttrConstraintList OPTIONAL }

    ContentType ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER

    AttrConstraintList ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF AttrConstraint

    AttrConstraint ::= SEQUENCE {
      attrType    AttributeType,
      attrValues  SET SIZE (1..MAX) OF AttributeValue }



   The fields of MgmtTrustAnchorInfo are used as follows:

   o  taUsage represents the authorized uses of the management trust
      anchor using the TrustAnchorUsage structure.




Housley, et al.           Expires April 9, 2009                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                     TAF                      October 2008


   o  tampSeqNum is OPTIONAL.  This field has been deprecated.  TAMP
      [TAMP] provides sequence number propagation and processing
      details.

   The TrustAnchorUsage is defined using the CMSContentConstraints type
   defined in [CCC], and repeated above.  The CMSContentConstraints is a
   list of permitted content types and associated constraints.  The
   management trust anchor can be used to validate digital signatures on
   the permitted content types, including TAMP message content types.

   The anyContentType object identifier can be used to indicate that the
   trust anchor is unconstrained.  The apex trust anchor has an implicit
   CMSContentConstraints field with a single permitted content type of
   anyContentType.  Where anyContentType is asserted or implied,
   canSource and attrConstraints MUST BE absent, indicating the trust
   anchor can serve as a source for any content type without any
   constraints.

   The fields of ContentTypeConstraint are used as follows:

   o  contentType indicates the encapsulated content type identifier
      that can be validated using the management trust anchor.  For
      example, it contains id-ct-firmwarePackage when the management
      trust anchor can be used to validate digital signatures on
      firmware packages [RFC4108].  A particular content type MUST NOT
      appear more than once in the list.  The CMS-related content types
      need not be included in the list of permitted content types.
      These content types are always authorized to facilitate the use of
      CMS in the protection of content, and they MUST NOT appear in the
      contentType field.  The always authorized content types are:

      *  id-signedData,

      *  id-envelopedData,

      *  id-digestedData,

      *  id-encryptedData,

      *  id-ct-authEnvelopedData,

      *  id-ct-authData,

      *  id-ct-compressedData,

      *  id-ct-contentCollection

Internet-Draft                     TAF                      October 2008


      *  id-ct-contentWithAttrs.

   o  canSource is a Boolean flag, and it applies to direct signatures
      or direct authentication for the specified content type.  If the
      canSource flag is FALSE, then the management trust anchor cannot
      be used to directly sign or authenticate the specified content
      type.  Regardless of the flag value, a management trust anchor can
      be used to sign or authenticate outer layers when multiple layers
      of CMS protected content type are present.

   o  attrConstraints is an OPTIONAL field that contains a sequence of
      content type specific constraints.  If the attrConstraints field
      is absent, then the management trust anchor can be used to verify
      the specified content type without any further checking.  If the
      attrConstraints field is present, then the management trust anchor
      can only be used to verify the specified content type if all of
      the constraints for that content type are satisfied.  Content type
      constraints are checked by matching the attribute values in the
      AttrConstraintList against the attribute value in the content.
      The constraints checking fails if the attribute is present and the
      attribute value is not one of the values provided in
      AttrConstraintList.

   The AttrConstraintList contains a sequence of attributes, which is
   defined in [CCC] and repeated above.  The fields of AttrConstraint
   are used as follows:

   o  attrType is the object identifier of the signed attribute carried
      in the SignerInfo of the content.  For a signed content to satisfy
      the constraint, if the SignerInfo includes a signed attribute of
      the same type, then the signed attribute MUST contain one of the
      values supplied in the attrValues field.

   o  attrValues provides one or more acceptable signed attribute
      values.  It is a set of AttributeValue.  For a signed content to
      satisfy the constraint, if the SignerInfo includes a signed
      attribute of the type identified in the attrType field, then the
      signed attribute MUST contain one of the values in the set.

2.5.  Trust Anchor Title



    TrustAnchorTitle ::= UTF8String (SIZE (1..64))



   taTitle is OPTIONAL.  When it is present, it provides a human

Internet-Draft                     TAF                      October 2008


   readable name for the trust anchor.  The text is encoded in UTF-8
   [RFC3629], which accommodates most of the world's writing systems.

2.6.  Certification Path Controls



    CertPathControls ::= SEQUENCE {
      taName           Name,
      certificate      [0] Certificate OPTIONAL,
      policySet        [1] CertificatePolicies OPTIONAL,
      policyFlags      [2] CertPolicyFlags OPTIONAL,
      clearanceConstr  [3] AuthorityClearanceConstraints OPTIONAL,
      nameConstr       [4] NameConstraints OPTIONAL }



   certPath is OPTIONAL.  When it is present, it provides the controls
   needed to initialize an X.509 certification path validation algorithm
   implementation (see Section 6 in [RFC5280]).  When absent, the trust
   anchor cannot be used to validate the signature on an X.509
   certificate.  For the apex trust anchor, this field contains the
   certification path controls associated with the operational public
   key.

   taName provides the X.500 distinguished name associated with the
   trust anchor, and this distinguished name is used to construct and
   validate an X.509 certification path.  The name MUST NOT be an empty
   sequence.  An identity trust anchor is of little use without a
   distinguished name.  Omission of the taName prevents the trust anchor
   from performing delegation using X.509 certificates.

   certificate provides an OPTIONAL X.509 certificate, which can be used
   in some environments to represent the trust anchor in certification
   path development and validation.  If the certificate is present, the
   subject name in the certificate MUST exactly match the X.500
   distinguished name provided in the taName field.  The complete
   description of the syntax and semantics of the Certificate are
   provided in [RFC5280].  Constraints defined in the taType, policySet,
   policyFlags, clearanceConstr, nameConstr and exts fields within
   TrustAnchorInfo augment or replace values contained in a certificate;
   values defined in these TrustAnchorInfo fields are always enforced.
   Extensions included in a certificate are enforced only if there is no
   value in the corresponding structure in the TrustAnchorInfo.
   Correspondence between extensions within a certificate and
   TrustAnchorInfo fields is defined as follows:

   o  id-pe-wrappedApexContinKey extensions correspond to the
      TrustAnchorType.apex field.

   o  id-pe-cmsContentConstraints extensions correspond to the
      TrustAnchorType.mgmt field.

   o  id-ce-certificatePolicies extensions correspond to the
      CertPathControls.policySet field.

   o  id-ce-policyConstraints extensions correspond to the
      CertPolicyFlags.inhibitPolicyMapping and
      CertPolicyFlags.requireExplicitPolicy fields.

   o  id-ce-inhibitAnyPolicy extensions correspond to the
      CertPolicyFlags.inhibitAnyPolicy field.

   o  id-ce-authorityClearanceConstraints extensions correspond to the
      CertPathControls.clearanceConstr field.

   o  id-ce-nameConstraints extensions correspond to the
      CertPathControls.nameConstr field.




    CertificatePolicies ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF PolicyInformation

    PolicyInformation ::= SEQUENCE {
      policyIdentifier  CertPolicyId,
      policyQualifiers  SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF
                              PolicyQualifierInfo OPTIONAL }

    CertPolicyId ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER


   policySet is OPTIONAL.  When present, it contains sequence of
   certificate policy identifiers to be provided as inputs to the
   certification path validation algorithm.  When absent, the special
   value any-policy is provided as the input to the certification path
   validation algorithm.  The complete description of the syntax and
   semantics of the CertificatePolicies are provided in [RFC5280],
   including the syntax for PolicyInformation.  In this context, the
   OPTIONAL policyQualifiers structure MUST NOT be included.

   policyFlags is OPTIONAL.  When present, three Boolean values for
   input to the certification path validation algorithm are provided in
   a BIT STRING.  When absent, the input to the certification path
   validation algorithm is { FALSE, FALSE, FALSE }, which represents the
   most liberal setting for these flags.  The three bits are used as
   follows:

      inhibitPolicyMapping indicates if policy mapping is allowed in the
      certification path.  When set to TRUE, policy mapping is not
      permitted.  This value represents the initial-policy-mapping-
      inhibit input value to the certification path validation algorithm
      described in section 6.1.1 of [RFC5280].

      requireExplicitPolicy indicates if the certification path MUST be
      valid for at least one of the certificate policies in the
      policySet.  When set to TRUE, all certificates in the
      certification path MUST contain an acceptable policy identifier in
      the certificate policies extension.  This value represents the
      initial-explicit-policy input value to the certification path
      validation algorithm described in section 6.1.1 of [RFC5280].  An
      acceptable policy identifier is a member of the policySet or the
      identifier of a policy that is declared to be equivalent through
      policy mapping.  This bit MUST be set to FALSE if policySet is
      absent.

      inhibitAnyPolicy indicates whether the special anyPolicy policy
      identifier, with the value { 2 5 29 32 0 }, is considered an
      explicit match for other certificate policies.  When set to TRUE,
      the special anyPolicy policy identifier is only considered a match
      for itself.  This value represents the initial-any-policy-inhibit
      input value to the certification path validation algorithm
      described in section 6.1.1 of [RFC5280].

        SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF Clearance

    Clearance ::= SEQUENCE {

      classList          [1] ClassList DEFAULT {unclassified},
      securityCategories [2] SET OF SecurityCategory OPTIONAL }

    ClassList ::= BIT STRING {

      unclassified  (1),
      restricted    (2),
      confidential  (3),
      secret        (4),

      value  [1] EXPLICIT SECURITY-CATEGORY.&Type
                      ({SecurityCategoriesTable}{@type}) }

    SECURITY-CATEGORY ::= TYPE-IDENTIFIER

    SecurityCategoriesTable SECURITY-CATEGORY ::= {...}


   clearanceConstr is OPTIONAL.  It has the same syntax and semantics as
   the Authority Clearance Constraints certificate extension as
   specified in [ClearConstr].  When it is present, constraints are
   provided on the Authority Clearance Constraints certificate extension
   and Clearance certificate extension that might appear in subordinate
   X.509 certificates.  For a subordinate certificate to be valid, it
   MUST conform to these constraints.  When it is absent, no constraints
   are imposed on the Authority Clearance Constraints certificate
   extension and Clearance certificate extension that might appear in
   subordinate X.509 certificates.



    NameConstraints ::= SEQUENCE {
      permittedSubtrees  [0] GeneralSubtrees OPTIONAL,

    GeneralSubtrees ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF GeneralSubtree

    GeneralSubtree ::= SEQUENCE {
      base     GeneralName,
      minimum  [0] BaseDistance DEFAULT 0,

      maximum  [1] BaseDistance OPTIONAL }

   BaseDistance ::= INTEGER (0..MAX)


   nameConstr is OPTIONAL.  It has the same syntax and semantics as the
   Name Constraints certificate extension [RFC5280], which includes a
   list of permitted names and a list of excluded names.  The definition
   of GeneralName can be found in [RFC5280].  When it is present,
   constraints are provided on names (including alternative names) that
   might appear in subordinate X.509 certificates.  When applied to
   Certification Authority (CA) certificates, the CA can apply further
   constraints by including the Name Constraints certificate extension
   in subordinate certificates.  For a subordinate certificate to be
   valid, it MUST conform to these constraints.  When it is absent, no
   constraints are imposed on names that appear in subordinate X.509
   certificates.

   When the trust anchor is used to validate a certification path,
   CertPathControls provides limitations on certification paths that
   will successfully validate.  An application that is validating a
   certification path MUST NOT ignore these limitations, but the
   application can impose additional limitations to ensure that the
   validated certification path is appropriate for the intended
   application context.  As input to the certification path validation
   algorithm, an application MAY:

   o  Provide a subset of the certification policies provided in the
      policySet;

   o  Provide a TRUE value for any of the flags in the policyFlags;

   o  Provide a subset of clearance values provided in the
      clearanceConstr;

   o  Provide a subset of the permitted names provided in the
      nameConstr;

   o  Provide additional excluded names to the ones that are provided in
      the nameConstr

2.7.  Extensions

   exts is OPTIONAL.  When it is present, it can be used to associate
   additional information with the trust anchor using the standard
   Extensions structure.  Extensions that are anticipated to be widely
   used have been included in the CertPathControls structure to avoid
   overhead associated with use of the Extensions structure.  To avoid

3.  Security Considerations

   Compromise of an identity trust anchor private key permits
   unauthorized parties to issue certificates that will be acceptable to
   all applications configured with the corresponding identity trust
   anchor.  The unauthorized private key holder will be limited by the
   certification path controls associated with the identity trust
   anchor.  For example, clearance constraints in the identity trust
   anchor will determine the clearances that will be accepted in
   certificates that are issued by the unauthorized private key holder.

   Compromise of a management trust anchor private key permits
   unauthorized parties to generate signed messages that will be
   acceptable to all applications that use a trust anchor store
   containing the corresponding management trust anchor.  For example,
   if the management trust anchor is authorized to sign firmware
   packages, then the unauthorized private key holder can generate
   firmware that may be successfully installed and used by applications
   that trust the management trust anchor.

   Compromise of the Apex Trust Anchor operational private key permits
   unauthorized parties to generate signed messages that will be
   acceptable to all applications that use a trust anchor store
   containing the corresponding apex trust anchor.  The unauthorized
   private key holder can generate signed messages of any content type
   that may be accepted and used by applications that trust the apex
   trust anchor.  The contingency private key offers a potential way to
   recover from such a compromise.

   The compromise of a CA's private key leads to the same type of
   problems as the compromise of an identity or a management trust
   anchor private key.  The unauthorized private key holder will be
   limited by the certification path controls associated with the trust
   anchor.  If the CA is subordinate to a management trust anchor, the
   scope of potential damage caused by a private key compromise is also
   limited by the CMS content constraints certificate extension [CCC] in
   the CA certificate, the CMS content constraints on any superior CA
   certificates, and the CMS content constraints on the parent
   management trust anchor.

   The compromise of an end entity private key leads to the same type of
   problems as the compromise of an identity or a management trust
   anchor private key, except that the end entity is unable to issue any
   certificates.  The unauthorized private key holder will be limited by
   the certification path controls associated with the trust anchor.  If
   the certified public key is subordinate to a management trust anchor,
   the scope of potential damage caused by a private key compromise is
   also limited by the CMS content constraints certificate extension

   [CCC] in the end entity certificate, the CMS content constraints on
   any superior CA certificates, and the CMS content constraints on the
   parent management trust anchor.

   Premature disclosure of the key-encryption key used to encrypt the
   apex trust anchor contingency public key may result in early exposure
   of the apex trust anchor contingency public key.

   Usage of a certificate independent of the TrustAnchorInfo structure
   that envelopes it must be carefully managed to avoid violating
   constraints expressed in the TrustAnchorInfo.  When enveloping a
   certificate in a TrustAnchorInfo structure, values included in the
   certificate should be evaluated to ensure there is no confusion or
   conflict with values in the TrustAnchorInfo structure.
