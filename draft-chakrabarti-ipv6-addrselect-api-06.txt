Internet-Draft    IPv6 Socket API for Address Selection       May 2007


Abstract

   The IPv6 default address selection document [RFC3484] describes the
   rules for selecting source and destination IPv6 addresses, and
   indicates that applications should be able to reverse the sense of
   some of the address selection rules through some unspecified API.
   However, no such socket API exists in the basic [RFC3493] or advanced
   [RFC3542] IPv6 socket API documents.  This document fills that gap by
   specifying new socket level options and flags for the getaddrinfo()
   API to specify preferences for address selection that modify the
   default address selection algorithm.  The socket API described in
   this document will be particularly useful for IPv6 applications that
   want to choose between temporary and public addresses, and for Mobile
   IPv6 aware applications that want to use the care-of address for
   communication.

Internet-Draft    IPv6 Socket API for Address Selection       May 2007


1.  Introduction

   [RFC3484] specifies the default address selection rules for IPv6
   [RFC2460].  This document defines socket API extensions that allow
   applications to override the default choice of address selection.
   Privacy considerations [RFC3041] have introduced "public" and
   "temporary" addresses.  IPv6 Mobility [RFC3775] introduces "home
   address" and "care-of address" definitions in the mobile systems.

   The default address selection rules in [RFC3484] in summary are that
   a public address is preferred over a temporary address, that a mobile
   IPv6 home address is preferred over a care-of address, and that a
   larger scope address is preferred over a smaller scope address.
   Although it is desirable to have default rules for address selection,
   an application may want to reverse certain address selection rules
   for efficiency and other application-specific reasons.

   Currently IPv6 socket API extensions provide mechanisms to choose a
   specific source address through simple bind() operation or
   IPV6_PKTINFO socket option [RFC3542].  However, in order to use
   bind() or IPV6_PKTINFO socket option, the application itself must
   make sure that the source address is appropriate for the destination
   address (e.g., with respect to the interface used to send packets to
   the destination).  The application also needs to verify the
   appropriateness of the source address scope with respect to the
   destination address and so on.  This can be quite complex for the
   application, since in effect it needs to implement all the default
   address selection rules in order to change its preferences with
   respect to one of the rules.

   The mechanism presented in this document allows the application to
   specify attributes of the source addresses it prefers while still
   having the system perform the rest of the address selection rules.
   For instance, if an application specifies that it
   prefers to use a care-of address over a home address as the source
   address and if the host has two care-of addresses, one public and one
   temporary, then the host would select the public care-of address by
   following the default address selection rule for preferring a public
   over a temporary address.

   A socket option has been deemed useful for this purpose, as it
   enables an application to specify address selection preferences on a
   per-socket basis.  It can also provide the flexibility of enabling
   and disabling address selection preferences in non-connected (UDP)
   sockets.  The socket option uses a set of flags for specifying
   address selection preferences.  Since the API should not assume a
   particular implementation method of the address selection [RFC3484]
   in the network layer or in getaddrinfo(), the corresponding set of

Internet-Draft    IPv6 Socket API for Address Selection       May 2007


   flags are also defined for getaddrinfo().

   As a result, this document introduces several flags for address
   selection preferences that alter the default address selection
   [RFC3484] for a number of rules.  It analyzes the usefulness of
   providing API functionality for different default address selection
   rules; it provides API to alter only those rules that are possibly
   used by certain classes of applications.  In addition, it also
   considers CGA [RFC3972] and non-CGA source addresses when CGA
   addresses are available in the system.  In the future, more
   destination or source flags may be added to expand the API as the
   needs may arise.

   The approach in this document is to allow the application to specify
   preferences for address selection and not to be able to specify hard
   requirements: For instance, an application can set a flag to prefer a
   temporary source address, but if no temporary source addresses are
   available at the node, a public address would be chosen instead.

   Specifying hard requirements for address selection would be
   problematic for several reasons.  The major one is that in the vast
   majority of cases the application would like to be able to
   communicate even if an address with the 'optimal' attributes is not
   available.  For instance, an application that performs very short,
   e.g., UDP, transactional exchanges (e.g.  DNS queries), might prefer
   to use a care-of address when running on a mobile host which is away
   from home since this provides a short round-trip time in many cases.
   But if the application is running on a mobile host that is at home,
   or running on a host which isn't providing Mobile IPv6, then it
   doesn't make sense for the application to fail due to no care-of
   address being available.  Also, in particular when using UDP sockets
   and the sendto() or sendmsg() primitives, the use of hard
   requirements would have been problematic, since the set of available
   IP addresses might very well have changed from when the application
   called getaddrinfo() until it called sendto() or sendmsg(), which
   would introduce new failure modes.

   For the few applications that have hard requirements on the
   attributes of the IP addresses they use, this document defines a
   verification function which allows such applications to properly fail
   to communicate when their address selection requirements are not met.

   Furthermore, the approach is to define two flags for each rule that
   can be modified, so that an application can specify its preference
   for addresses selected as per the rule, the opposite preference (i.e.
   an address selected as per the rule reverted), or choose not to set
   either of the flags relating to that rule and leave it up to the
   system default (see section 3.1).  This approach allows different

   implementations to have different system defaults, and works with
   getaddrinfo() as well as setsockopt().  (For setsockopt a different
   approach could have been chosen, but that would still require this
   approach for getaddrinfo.)

   Note that this document does not directly modify the destination address
   selection rules described in [RFC3484]. An analysis has been done to see
   which destination address rules may be required to be altered by the 
   applications. Rule number 4(prefer home address), 8(prefer smaller scope),
   7(prefer native interfaces) of default address selection document [RFC3484]
   were taken into consideration for destination address alteration. But, at
   this point, there was not enough practical usage for applications to alter
   destination address selection rules directly by applying the setsockopt()
   with a preferred destination type of address flag.  
   Moreover, [RFC3484] destination address selection rules are dependent on
   source address selections, thus by altering the default source address
   selection by using the methods described in this document, one indirectly 
   influences the choice of destination address selection. Hence this document
   explains how getaddrinfo() can be used to select the destination address 
   while taking the preferred source addresses into consideration [Section 11].

   This document specifies extensions only to the Basic IPv6 socket API
   specified in [RFC3493].  The intent is that this document serves as a
   model for expressing preferences for attributes of IP addresses, that
   also need to be expressible in other networking API such as those
   found in middleware systems and the Java environment.

2.  Definition Of Terms

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Address preference flag:
      A flag expressing a preference for a particular type of
      (e.g. temporary, public) source or destination addresses.

   Opposite flags:
      Each flag expressing an address preference has a so called
      "opposite flag" expressing the opposite preference:

      *  home address preference flag is the opposite of the care-of
         address preference flag.

      *  temporary address preference flag is the opposite of the public
         address preference flag.

      *  CGA address preference flag is the opposite of the non-CGA
         address preference flag.

   Contradictory flags:
      Any combination of flags including both a flag expressing a given
      address preference and a flag expressing the opposite preference
      constitutes Such flags are contradictory by definition of their
      usefulness with respect to source address selection.  For example,
      consider a set of flags including both the home address preference
      flag and the care-of address preference flag.  When considering
      source address selection, the selected address can be a home
      address, or a care-of address, but it cannot be both at the same
      time.  Hence, to prefer an address which is both a home address,
      and a care-of address, is contradictory.

3.  Usage Scenario

   The examples discussed here are limited to applications supporting
   Mobile IPv6, IPv6 Privacy Extensions and Cryptographically Generated
   Addresses.  Address selection document [RFC3484] recommends that home
   addresses should be preferred over care-of address when both are
   configured.  However, a mobile node may want to prefer care-of
   address as source address for DNS query in the foreign network as it
   normally means a shorter and local return path compared to the route
   via the mobile node's home-agent when the query contains home address
   as source address.  Another example is IKE application which requires
   care-of address as its source address for the initial security
   association pair with Home Agent [RFC3775] while the mobile node
   boots up at the foreign network and wants to do the key exchange
   before a successful home-registration.  Also a Mobile IPv6 aware
   application may want to toggle between home address and care-of
   address depending on its location and state of the application.  It
   may also want to open different sockets and use home address as
   source address for one socket and care-of address for the others.

   In a non-mobile environment, an application may similarly prefer to
   use temporary address as source address for certain cases.  By
   default, the source address selection rule selects "public" address
   when both are available.  For example, an application supporting web
   browser and mail-server may want to use "temporary" address for the
   former and "public" address for the mail-server as a mail-server may
   require reverse path for DNS records for anti-spam rules.

   Similarly, a node may be configured to use Cryptographically
   Generated Addresses [RFC3972] by default, as in Secure Neighbor
   Discovery [RFC3971], but an application may prefer not to use it.
   For instance, fping [FPING], a debugging tool which tests basic
   reachability of multiple destinations by sending packets in parallel,
   may find that the cost and time incurred in proof-of-ownership by CGA
   verification is not justified.  On the other hand, when a node is not
   configured for CGA as default, an application may prefer using CGA by
   setting the corresponding preference.

4.  Design Alternatives

   Some suggested to have per-application flags instead of per-socket
   and per-packet flags.  However, this design stays with per-socket and
   per-packet flags for the following reasons:

   o  While some systems have per environment/application flags (such as
      environment variables in Unix systems) this might not be available
      in all systems which implement the socket API.

   o  When an application links with some standard library, that library
      might use the socket API, while the application is unaware of that
      fact.  Mechanisms that would provide per application flags may
      affect not only the application itself but also the libraries,
      hence creating risks of unintended consequences.

   Instead of the pair of 'flag' and 'opposite flag' for each rule that
   can be modified, the socket option could have been defined to use a
   single 'flag' value for each rule.  This would still have allowed
   different implementations to have different default settings as long
   as the applications were coded to first retrieve the default setting
   (using getsockopt()), and then clear or set the 'flag' according to
   their preferences, and finally set the new value with setsockopt().

   But such an approach would not be possible for getaddrinfo() because
   all the preferences would need to be expressible in the parameters
   that are passed with a single getaddrinfo() call.  Hence, for
   consistency, the 'flag' and 'opposite flag' approach is used for both
   getaddrinfo() and setsockopt().

5.  Address Preference Flags

   The following flags are defined to alter or set the default rule of
   source and destination address selection rules discussed in default
   address selection specification [RFC3484].

      IPV6_PREFER_SRC_HOME /* Prefer Home address as source */

      IPV6_PREFER_SRC_COA /* Prefer Care-of address as source */

      IPV6_PREFER_SRC_TMP /* Prefer Temporary address as source */

      IPV6_PREFER_SRC_PUBLIC /* Prefer Public address as source */

      IPV6_PREFER_SRC_CGA /* Prefer CGA address as source */

      IPV6_PREFER_SRC_NONCGA /* Prefer a non-CGA address as source */

   These flags can be combined together in a flag-set to express more
   complex address preferences.  However such combinations can result in
   a contradictory flag-set, for example:

      IPV6_PREFER_SRC_PUBLIC | IPV6_PREFER_SRC_TMP

      IPV6_PREFER_SRC_HOME | IPV6_PREFER_SRC_COA

      IPV6_PREFER_SRC_HOME | IPV6_PREFER_SRC_COA | IPV6_PREFER_SRC_TMP

      IPV6_PREFER_SRC_CGA | IPV6_PREFER_SRC_NONCGA

      Etc.

   Example of valid combination of address selection flags are given
   below:

      IPV6_PREFER_SRC_HOME | IPV6_PREFER_SRC_PUBLIC

      IPV6_PREFER_SRC_HOME | IPV6_PREFER_SRC_CGA

      IPV6_PREFER_SRC_COA | IPV6_PREFER_SRC_PUBLIC | IPV6_PREFER_SRC_CGA

      IPV6_PREFER_SRC_HOME | IPV6_PREFER_SRC_NONCGA

   If a flag-set includes a combination of 'X' and 'Y', and if 'Y' is
   not applicable or available in the system, then the selected address
   has attribute 'X' and system default for the attribute 'Y'.  For
   example, on a system that has only public addresses, the valid
   combination of flags:

      IPV6_PREFER_SRC_TMP | IPV6_PREFER_SRC_HOME

   would result in the selected address being a public home address,
   since no temporary addresses are available.

6.  Additions to the Socket Interface

   The IPv6 Basic Socket API [RFC3493] defines socket options for IPv6.
   To allow applications to influence address selection mechanisms this
   document adds a new socket option at the IPPROTO_IPV6 level.  This
   socket option is called IPV6_ADDR_PREFERENCES.  It can be used with
   setsockopt() and getsockopt() calls to set and get the address
   selection preferences affecting all packets sent via a given socket.
   The socket option value (optval) is a 32-bits unsigned integer
   argument.  The argument consists of a number of flags where each flag
   indicates an address selection preference which modifies one of the
   rules in the default address selection specification.

   The following flags are defined to alter or set the default rule of
   source and destination address selection rules discussed in default
   address selection specification [RFC3484].  They are defined as a
   result of including the <netinet/in.h> header:

      IPV6_PREFER_SRC_HOME /* Prefer Home address as source */

      IPV6_PREFER_SRC_COA /* Prefer Care-of address as source */

      IPV6_PREFER_SRC_TMP /* Prefer Temporary address as source */

      IPV6_PREFER_SRC_PUBLIC /* Prefer Public address as source */

      IPV6_PREFER_SRC_CGA /* Prefer CGA address as source */

      IPV6_PREFER_SRC_NONCGA /* Prefer a non-CGA address as source */

   NOTE: No source preference flag for longest matching prefix is
   defined here because it is believed to be handled by the policy table
   defined in the default address selection specification.

   When the IPV6_ADDR_PREFERENCES is successfully set with setsockopt(),
   the option value given is used to specify address preference for any
   connection initiation through the socket and all subsequent packets
   sent via that socket.  If no option is set, the system selects a
   default value as per default address selection algorithm or by some
   other equivalent means.

   Setting contradictory flags at the same time results in the error
   EINVAL.

7.  Additions to the protocol-independent nodename translation

   Section 8 of Default Address Selection [RFC3484] document indicates
   possible implementation strategies for getaddrinfo() [RFC3493].  One
   of them suggests that getaddrinfo() collects available source/
   destination pair from the network layer after being sorted at the
   network layer with full knowledge of source address selection.
   Another strategy is to call down to the network layer to retrieve
   source address information and then sort the list in the context of
   getaddrinfo().

   This implies that getaddrinfo() should be aware of the address
   selection preferences of the application, since getaddrinfo() is
   independent of any socket the application might be using.

   Thus if an application alters the default address selection rules by
   using setsockopt() with the IPV6_ADDR_PREFERENCES option, the
   application should also use the corresponding address selection
   preference flags with its getaddrinfo() call.

   For that purpose, the addrinfo data structure defined in Basic IPV6
   Socket API Extension [RFC3493] has been extended with an extended
   "ai_eflags" flag-set field to provides the designers freedom of
   adding more flags as necessary without crowding the valuable bit
   space in the "ai_flags" flag-set field.  The extended addrinfo data
   structre is defined as a result of including the <netdb.h> header:

    struct addrinfo {
        int ai_flags;             /* input flags */
        int ai_family;            /* protocol family for socket */
        int ai_socktype;          /* socket type */
        int ai_protocol;          /* protocol for socket */
        socklen_t ai_addrlen;     /* length of socket address */
        char *ai_canonname;       /* canonical name for hostname */
        struct sockaddr *ai_addr; /* socket address for socket */
        struct addrinfo *ai_next; /* pointer to next in list */
        int ai_eflags;            /* Extended flags for special usage */
    };

   Note that the additional field for extended flags are added at the
   bottom of the addrinfo structure to preserve binary compatibility of
   the new functionality with the old applications which use the
   existing addrinfo data structure.

   A new flag (AI_EXTFLAGS) is defined for the "ai_flags" flag-set field
   of the addrinfo data structure to tell the system to look for the
   "ai_eflags" extended flag-set field in the addrinfo structure.  It is
   defined in the <netdb.h> header:

      AI_EXTFLAGS /* extended flag-set present */

   If AI_EXTFLAGS flag is set in "ai_flags" flag-set field of the
   addrinfo data structure, then the getaddrinfo() implementation MUST
   look for the "ai_eflags" values stored in the extended flag-set field
   "ai_eflags" of the addrinfo data structure.  The flags stored in the
   extended flags set "ai_eflags" field are only meaningful if the
   AI_EXTFLAGS flag is set in the "ai_flags" flag-set field of the
   addrinfo data structure.  By default, AI_EXTFLAGS is not set.
   If AI_EXTFLAGS is set in the "ai_flags" flag-set field, and the
   "ai_eflags" field is 0(zero), then AI_EXTFLAGS is ignored.

   The IPV6 source address preference values (IPV6_PREFER_SRC_*) defined
   for the IPV6_ADDR_PREFERENCES socket option are also used as
   address selection preference flags for the extended flag-set (ai_eflags)
   field of the addrinfo data structure, so that getaddrinfo() can
   return matching destination addresses corresponding to the source
   address preferences expressed by the caller application.

   Thus, an application passes source address selection hints to
   getaddrinfo by setting AI_EXTFLAGS in the "ai_flags" field of the
   addrinfo structure, and the corresponding address selection
   preference flags (IPV6_PREFER_SRC_*) in the "ai_eflags" field.

   Currently AI_EXTFLAGS is defined for the AF_INET6 socket protocol
   family only.  But its usage should be extendable to other socket
   protocol families as appropriate.

   If contradictory flags such as IPV6_PREFER_SRC_HOME and
   IPV6_PREFER_SRC_COA are set in ai_eflags, the getaddrinfo() fails and
   return the value EAI_BADEXTFLAGS which is defined in <netdb.h>.  
   This error value MUST be interpreted into a descriptive text string 
   when passed to the gai_strerror() function [RFC3493].

8.  Application Requirements

   An application should call getsockopt() prior calling setsockopt() if
   the application needs to be able to restore the socket back to the
   system default preferences.  Note, this is suggested for portability.
   An application which does not have this requirement can just use
   getaddrinfo() while specifying its preferences, followed by:

      uint32_t flags = IPV6_PREFER_SRC_TMP;

      if (setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IPV6, IPV6_ADDR_PREFERENCES,
                     (void *) &flags, sizeof (flags)) == -1) {
          perror("setsockopt IPV6_ADDR_REFERENCES");
          }

   An application which needs to be able to restore the default settings
   on the socket would instead do this:

      uint32_t save_flags, flags;
      int optlen = sizeof (save_flags);

      /* Save the existing IPv6_ADDR_PREFERENCE flags now */

      if (getsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IPV6, IPV6_ADDR_PREFERENCES,
                     (void *) &save_flags, &optlen) == -1 {
          perror("getsockopt IPV6_ADDR_REFERENCES");
          }

      /* Set the new flags */
      flags = IPV6_PREFER_SRC_TMP;
      if (setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IPV6, IPV6_ADDR_PREFERENCES,
                  (void *) &flags, sizeof (flags)) == -1) {
          perror("setsockopt IPV6_ADDR_REFERENCES");
          }

      /*
       *
       *  Do some work with the socket here.
       *
       */

      /* Restore the flags */

      if (setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IPV6, IPV6_ADDR_PREFERENCES,
                  (void *) &save_flags, sizeof (save_flags)) == -1) {
          perror("setsockopt IPV6_ADDR_REFERENCES");
          }

   Applications MUST not set contradictory flags at the same time.

   In order to allow different implementations to do different parts of
   address selection in getaddrinfo() and in the protocol stack, this
   specification requires that applications set the semantically
   equivalent flags when calling getaddrinfo() and setsockopt().  For
   example, if the application sets the IPV6_PREFER_SRC_COA flag, it
   MUST use the same for the "ai_eflag" field of the addrinfo data
   structure when calling getaddrinfo().  If applications are not
   setting the semantically equivalent flags the behavior of the
   implementation is undefined.

9.  Usage Example

   An example of usage of this API is given below:

    struct addrinfo hints, *ai, *ai0;
    uint32_t preferences;

    preferences = IPV6_PREFER_SRC_TMP;

    hints.ai_flags |= AI_EXTFLAGS;
    hints.ai_eflags = preferences;  /* Chosen address preference flag */
    /* Fill in other hints fields */

    getaddrinfo(....,&hints,. &ai0..);

    /* Loop over all returned addresses and do connect  */
    for (ai = ai0; ai; ai = ai->ai_next) {
        s = socket(ai->ai_family, ...);

        setsockopt(s, IPV6_ADDR_PREFERENCES, (void *) &preferences,
                   sizeof (preferences));

        if (connect(s, ai->ai_addr, ai->ai_addrlen) == -1){
            close (s);
            s = -1;
            continue;
            }

        break;
        }

    freeaddrinfo(ai0);

10.  Implementation Notes

   o  Within the same application, if a specific source address is set
      by either bind() or IPV6_PKTINFO socket option, while at the same
      time an address selection preference is expressed with the
      IPV6_ADDR_PREFERENCES socket option, then the source address
      setting carried by bind() or IPV6_PKTINFO takes precedence over
      the address selection setting.

   o  setsockopt() and getaddrinfo() should silently ignore any address
      preference flags that are not supported in the system.  For
      example, a host which does not implement Mobile IPv6, should not
      fail setsockopt() or getaddrinfo() that specify preferences for
      home or care-of addresses.  The socket option calls should return
      error (-1) and set errno to EINVAL when contradictory flags values
      are passed to them.

   o  If an implementation supports both stream and datagram sockets, it
      should implement the address preference mechanism API described in
      this document on both types of sockets.

   o  An implementation supporting this API MUST implement both
      getaddrinfo() extension flags and socket option flags processing
      for portability of applications.

   o  The following flags are set as default values on a system (which
      is consistent with [RFC3484] defaults):

      IPV6_PREFER_SRC_HOME

      IPV6_PREFER_SRC_PUBLIC

      IPV6_PREFER_SRC_CGA

11.  Mapping to Default Address Selection Rules

   This API defines only those flags that are deemed to be useful by the
   applications to alter default address selection rules.  Thus we
   discuss the mapping of each set of flags to the corresponding rule
   number in the address selection document [RFC3484].

      Source address selection rule #4 (prefer home address):

      IPV6_PREFER_SRC_HOME (default)

      IPV6_PREFER_SRC_COA

      Source address selection rule #7 (prefer public address) :

      IPV6_PREFER_SRC_PUBLIC (default)

      IPV6_PREFER_SRC_TMP

   At this time, this document does not define flags to alter source
   address selection rule #2 (prefer appropriate scope for destination)
   and destination address selection rule #8 (prefer smaller scope) as
   the implementers felt that there were no practical applications that
   can take advantage of reverting the scoping rules of IPv6 default
   address selection.  Flags altering other destination address
   selection rules (#4, prefer home address and #7, prefer native
   transport) could have applications, but the problem is that the local
   system cannot systematically determine whether a destination address
   is a tunnel address for destination rule #7 (although it can when the
   destination address is one of its own, or can be syntactically
   recognized as a tunnel address, e.g., a 6to4 address.)  The flags
   defined for source address selection rule #4 (prefer home address)
   should also take care of destination address selection rule #4.  Thus
   at this point, it was decided not to define flags for these
   destination rules.

   Also, note that there is no corresponding destination address
   selection rule for source address selection rule #7 (prefer public
   addresses) of default address selection document [RFC3484].  However,
   this API provides a way for an application to make sure that the
   source address preference set in setsockopt() is taken into account
   by the getaddrinfo() function.  Let's consider an example to
   understand this scenario.  DA and DB are two global destination
   addresses and the node has two global source addresses SA and SB
   through interface A and B respectively.  SA is a temporary address
   while SB is a public address.  The application has set
   IPV6_PREFER_SRC_TMP in the setsockopt() flag.  The route to DA points
   to interface A and route to DB points to interface B. Thus when



Nordmark, et al.        Expires November 10, 2007              [Page 19]

Internet-Draft    IPv6 Socket API for Address Selection       May 2007


   AI_EXTFLAGS in ai_flags and IPV6_PREFER_SRC_TMP in ai_eflags are set,
   getaddrinfo() returns DA before DB in the list of destination
   addresses and thus SA will be used to communicate with the
   destination DA.  Similarly, getaddrinfo() returns DB before DA when
   AI_EXTFLAGS and ai_eflags are set to IPV6_PREFER_SRC_PUBLIC.  Thus
   the source address preference is taking effect into destination
   address selection and as well as source address selection by the
   getaddrinfo() function.

   The following numerical example clarifies the above further.

   Imagine a host with two addresses:

      1234::1:1 public

      9876::1:2 temporary

   The destination has the following two addresses:

      1234::9:3

      9876::9:4

   By default getaddrinfo() will return the destination addresses in the
   order

      1234::9:3

      9876::9:4

   because the public source is preferred and 1234 matches more bits
   with the public source address.  On the other hand, if ai_flags is
   set to AI_EXTFLAGS and ai_eflags to IPV6_PREFER_SRC_TMP, getaddrinfo
   will return the addresses in the reverse order since the temporary
   source address will be preferred.

   Other source address rules (that are not mentioned here) were also
   deemed not applicable for changing its default on a per-application
   basis.

12.  IPv4-mapped IPv6 Addresses

   IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses for AF_INET6 sockets are supported in this
   API.  In some cases the application of IPv4-mapped addresses are
   limited because the API attributes are IPv6 specific.  For example,
   IPv6 temporary addresses and cryptographically generated addresses
   have no IPv4 counterparts.  Thus the IPV6_PREFER_SRC_TMP or
   IPV6_PREFER_SRC_CGA are not directly applicable to an IPv4-mapped
   IPv6 address.  However, the IPv4-mapped address support may be useful
   for mobile-IPv4 applications shifting source address between the home
   address and the care-of address.  Thus the IPV6_PREFER_SRC_COA and
   IPV6_PREFER_SRC_HOME are applicable to an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address.
   At this point it is not understood whether this API has any value to
   IPv4 addresses or AF_INET family of sockets.

13.  Validation function for source address

   Sometimes an application may have a requirement to only use addresses
   with some particular attribute, and if no such address is available
   the application should fail to communicate instead of communicating
   using the 'wrong' address.  In that situation, address selection
   preferences do not guarantee that the application requirements are
   met.  Instead, the application has to explicitly verify that the
   chosen address satisfies its requirements using a validation
   function.  Such an application would go through the following steps:

   1.  The application specifies one or more IPV6_PREFER_SRC_* flags and
       AI_EXTFLAGS ai_flags with getaddrinfo().

   2.  The application specifies the same IPV6_PREFER_SRC_* flags with
       setsockopt()

   3.  The application calls connect().  This applies even for datagram
       (UDP) sockets, as the connect call results in the stack selecting
       a source address, for TCP as well as UDP.

   4.  Retrieve the selected source address using the getsockname() API
       call.

   5.  Verify with the validation function that the retrieved address is
       satisfactory as specified below.  If not, abort the communication
       e.g., by closing the socket.

   The verification of temporary vs. public, home vs. care-of, CGA vs.
   not, are performed by a new validation function defined for this
   purpose:

      #include <netinet/in.h>

      short inet6_is_srcaddr(struct sockaddr_in6 *srcaddr,
                                  uint32_t flags);

   Where the flags contains the specified IPV6_PREFER_SRC_* source
   preference flags, and the srcaddr is a non-NULL pointer to a
   sockaddr_in6 structure initialized as follows:

   o  sin6_addr is a 128-bit IPv6 address of the local node.

   o  sin6_family MUST be set to AF_INET6.

   o  sin6_scope_id MUST be set if the address is link-local.

   inet6_is_srcaddr() is defined to return three possible values (0, 1,

   -1): The function returns true (1) when the IPv6 address corresponds
   to a valid address in the node and satisfies the given preference
   flags.  If the IPv6 address input value does not correspond to any
   address in the node or if the flags are not one of the valid
   preference flags, it returns a failure (-1).  If the input address
   does not match an address which satisfies the preference flags
   indicated, the function returns false (0.)

   This function can handle multiple valid preference flags combination
   as its second parameter, for example IPV6_PREFER_SRC_COA |
   IPV6_PREFER_SRC_TMP, which means that all flags MUST be satisfied for
   the result to be true.  Contradictory flag values result in a false
   return value.

   The function will return true for IPV6_PREFER_SRC_HOME even if the
   host is not implementing mobile IPv6, as well as for a mobile node
   which is at home (i.e., does not have any care-of address).

   addresses.  The setting of certain address preferences (e.g. not
   using a CGA address, or not using a temporary address) may be
   restricted to privileged processes because of security implications.

Appendix A.  Per Packet Address Selection Preference

   This document discusses setting source address selection preferences
   on a per socket basis with the new IPV6_ADDR_PREFERENCES socket
   option used in setsockopt().  The document does not encourage setting
   the source address selection preference on a per packet basis through
   the use of ancillary data objects with sendmsg(), or setsockopt()
   with unconnected datagram sockets.

   Per-packet source address selection is expensive as the system will
   have to determine the source address indicated by the application
   preference before sending each packet, while setsockopt() address
   preference on a connected socket makes the selection once and uses
   that source address for all packets transmitted through that socket
   end-point, as long as the socket option is set.

   However, this document provides guidelines for those implementations
   which like to have an option on implementing transmit-side ancillary
   data object support for altering default source address selection.
   Therefore, if an application chooses to use the per-packet source
   address selection, then the implementation should process at the
   IPPROTO_IPV6 level (cmsg_level) ancillary data object of type
   (cmsg_type) IPV6_ADDR_PREFERENCES containing as data (cmsg_data[]) a
   32-bits unsigned integer encoding the source address selection
   preference flags (e.g.  IPV6_PREFER_SRC_COA |
   IPV6_PREFER_SRC_PUBLIC), in a fashion similar to the advanced IPV6
   Socket API [RFC3542].  This address selection preference ancillary
   data object may be present along with other ancillary data objects.

   The implementation processing the ancillary data object is
   responsible for selection of preferred source address as indicated in
   the ancillary data object.  Thus, an application can use sendmsg() to
   pass an address selection preference ancillary data object to the
   IPv6 layer.  The following example shows usage of the ancillary data
   API for setting address preferences:

   void *extptr;
   socklen_t extlen;
   struct msghdr msg;
   struct cmsghdr *cmsgptr;
   int cmsglen;
   struct sockaddr_in6 dest;
   uint32_t flags;

   extlen = sizeof(flags);
   cmsglen = CMSG_SPACE(extlen);
   cmsgptr = malloc(cmsglen);
   cmsgptr->cmsg_len = CMSG_LEN(extlen);
   cmsgptr->cmsg_level = IPPROTO_IPV6;
   cmsgptr->cmsg_type = IPV6_ADDR_PREFERENCES;

   extptr = CMSG_DATA(cmsgptr);

   flags = IPV6_PREFER_SRC_COA;
   memcpy(extptr, &flags, extlen);

   msg.msg_control = cmsgptr;
   msg.msg_controllen = cmsglen;

   /* finish filling in msg{} */

   msg.msg_name = dest;

   sendmsg(s, &msg, 0);


   Thus when an IPV6_ADDR_PREFERENCES ancillary data object is passed to
   sendmsg(), the value included in the object is used to specify
   address preference for the packet being sent by sendmsg().

Internet-Draft    IPv6 Socket API for Address Selection       May 2007


Appendix B.  Changes from previous version of draft

   o  Added an appendix discussing setting source address selection
      preferences on a per packet basis, including via passing a
      transmit-side ancillary data object.

   o  Changed getaddrinfo()usage and removed the AI_PREFER flags.  Added
      one extended flag field in addrinfo structure and added one
      AI_flag in order to save bits.

   o  Removed scope address preferences as some questioned about
      applicability of IPV6_PREFER_SRC and DST scope rules alterations.

   o  Added -1 return value for inet6_is_srcaddr() for failure
      situation.

   o  Addressed comments by the working group and reviewers of this
      draft.

   o  Added a definition of term for X and not-X flags.

   o  Changed "not-X flag" by "opposite flag", and "X and not-X flags"
      by by "contradictory flags"

   o  updated rationale why not to deal with native transport
      destination address selection rule.

Appendix C.  Intellectual Property Statement

   This document only defines a source preference flag to choose
   Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA) as source address when
   applicable.  CGA are obtained using public keys and hashes to prove
   address ownership.  Several IPR claims have been made about such
   methods.
