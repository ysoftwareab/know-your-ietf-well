1. Introduction 

   FEC Framework document [FECARCH] defines the FEC Framework 
   Configuration Information that governs the overall FEC framework 
   operation common to any FEC scheme. This information MUST be 
   available at both sender and reciever(s). This document describes one 
   signalling protocol to determine and communicate the Configuration 
   information between sender and receiver(s). The configuration 
   information may be encoded in any compatible format such as SDP 
   [RFC4566], XML etc. The signaling protocol is intended to be generic

   and could be utilized by any FEC scheme and/or any Content Delivery 
   Protocol (CDP).   

   This document doesn't describe any FEC scheme specifics information 
   (for example, how are source blocks are constructed) or any sender or 
   receiver side operation for a particular FEC scheme (for example, 
   whether the receiver makes use of one or more repair flows that are 
   received) etc. Such FEC scheme specifics should be covered in 
   separate document(s). This document doesn't mandate a particular 
   encoding format for the configuration information either. 

   <What is CDP>     

   The FEC Framework document [FECARCH] defines a Content Delivery 
   Protocol (CDP) as a complete (suite of) specification which, through 
   the use of FEC Framework, is able to make use of a particular FEC 
   scheme to provide FEC capabilities. In other words, CDP is specific 
   to a FEC scheme, but makes use of common building blocks (including 
   signaling protocol) as defined in the FEC Framework document 
   [FECARCH]. 

   This document is structured such that Section 2 describes the terms 
   used in this document, section 3 describes the FEC Framework 
   configuration information, section 4 describes the signalling 
   protocol for the multicast, section 5 describes the signalling 
   protocol for the unicast, and section 6 describes security 
   consideration.

2. Terminology/Abbreviations 

   This document makes use of the terms/abbreviations defined in the FEC 
   Framework document [FECARCH]. Additionally, it defines 

   o  Media Sender   -  Node performing the Media encoding and producing 
      the original media flow to the 'FEC Sender'

   o  Media Receiver -  Node performing the Media decoding;  

   o  FEC Sender     -  Node performing the FEC encoding on the original 
      stream to produce the FEC stream 

   o  FEC Receiver   -  Node performing the FEC decoding, as needed, and 
      providing the original media flow to the Media receiver. 

   o  Sender         -  Same as FEC Sender 

   o  Receiver       -  Same as FEC Receiver 

   o  (Media) Stream -  A single media instance i.e. an audio stream or 
      a video stream. 

    

   This documents deliberately refers to the 'FEC Sender' and 'FEC 
   Receiver' as the 'Sender' and 'Receiver' respectively.  

    

3. FEC Framework Configuration Information  

   The FEC Framework [FECARCH] defines a minimum set of information that 
   MUST be communicated between the sender and receiver(s) for a proper 
   operation of an FEC scheme.  This information is referred to as "FEC 
   Framework Configuration Information". This is the information that 
   the FEC Framework needs in order to apply FEC protection to the 
   transport flows.  

   A single instance of the FEC Framework provides FEC protection for 
   all packets of a specified set of source packet flows, by means of 
   one or more packet flows consisting of repair packets. As per the FEC 
   Framework document [FECARCH], the FEC Framework Configuation 
   Information includes, for each instance of the FEC Framework:  

    

   1. Identification of Source Flow(s) 

   2. Identification of the repair flow(s) 

   3. Identification of FEC Scheme 

   4. Length of Source FEC payload ID

Internet-Draft      FEC Framework Config Signaling        February 2008 
    

   5. FEC Scheme Specific Information (FSSI) 

    

   FSSI basically provides an opaque container to encode FEC scheme 
   specific configuration information such as buffer size, decoding 
   wait-time etc. Please refer to the FEC Framework document [FECARCH] 
   for more details. 

   The signaling protocol described in this document requires that the 
   application layer responsible for the FEC Framework instance i.e. FEC 
   scheme provide the value for each of the configuration information 
   parameter (listed above) encoded as per the chosen encoding format. 
   Failure to receive the complete information, the signaling protocol 
   module must return an error for the OAM purposes and optionally 
   convey to the application layer. Please refer to the figure 1 of the 
   FEC Framework document [FECARCH] for further illustration.   

   This document does make any assumption that the 'FEC sender and 
   receiver' functionality and the 'Media Source/Receiver' functionality 
   are implemented on the single device, though it is likely to be the 
   case. 

    

3.1. Encoding Format 

   The FEC Framework configuration information (listed above in section 
   3) may be encoded in any format such as SDP, XML etc. as chosen or 
   prefered by a particular FEC Framework instance i.e. FEC Scheme. The 
   selection of such encoding format or syntax is independent of the 
   signaling protocol and beyond the scope of this document.  

   Whatever encoding format is selected for a particular FEC framework 
   instance, it must be known by the signaling protocol. This is to 
   provide a mean (e.g. a field such as Payload Type) in the signaling 
   protocol message(s) to convey the chosen encoding format for the 
   configuration information so that the Payload i.e. configuration 
   information can be correctly parsed as per the semantics of the 
   chosen encoding format. Please note that the the encoding format is 
   not a negotiated parameter, but rather a property of a particular FEC 
   Framework instance i.e. FEC scheme and/or its implementation. 

   Additionally, the encoding format for each FEC Framework 
   configuration parameter must be defined in terms of a sequence of 
   octets that can be embedded within the payload of the signaling 
   protocol message(s).  The length of the encoding format MUST either 
 
 
Asati                  Expires August 18, 2008                 [Page 5] 

Internet-Draft      FEC Framework Config Signaling        February 2008 
    

   be fixed, or it must be possible to derive the length from examining 
   the encoded octets themselves.  For example, the initial octets may 
   include some kind of length indication. 

   Each instance of the FEC Framework muse use a single encoding format 
   to describe e.g. encode all of the configuration information 
   associated with that instance. The signaling protocol may not 
   validate the encoded information, though it may validate the syntax 
   or length of the encoded information. 

   The reader may refer to the SDP elements document [FECSDP], which 
   describes the usage of 'SDP' encoding format as an example encoding 
   format for FEC framework configuration information.   

    

4. Signaling Protocol 

   FEC Framework [FECARCH] requires certain FEC Framework Configuration 
   Information to be available to both sender and receiver(s). This 
   configuration information is almost always formulated at the sender 
   (or on behalf of a sender), the receiver(s) somehow must get this 
   configuration information. While one may envision a static method to 
   populate the configuration information at both sender and 
   receiver(s), it would require the knowledge of every receiver in 
   advance and that is something not always feasible. Hence, there is a 
   desire to define and describe dynamic method i.e. signaling protocol 
   to convey the configuration information from sender to one or more 
   receivers.  

   It is important to note that there may be either only one receiver 
   needing the FEC Framework configuration information to FEC protect a 
   "unicasted multimedia stream" (such as Video On Demand stream), or 
   one or more receivers needing the FEC Framework configuration 
   information to FEC protect a "multicasted multimedia stream" (such as 
   Broadcast TV or IPTV). While the unicasted stream requires the 
   identification of the receiver (which typically initiates the  
   communication) at the sender, the multicasted stream doesn't require 
   the identification of the receiver at the sender.    

   Such diversity necessitates describing at least two signaling 
   protocols - one to deliver the configuration information to many 
   receivers via multicasting (described in section 4.1), and the other 
   to deliver the configuration information to one and only one receiver 
   via unicasting (described in section 4.2).

   and FEC receiver (that may or many not be the Media Sender and Media 
   Receiver respectively) such that FEC_Sender1 is serving 
   FEC_Reciver11,12,13 via the multicast signaling protocol, whereas the 
   FEC_Sender2 is serving only FEC_Reciever2 via the unicast signaling 
   protocol.

   The rest of the section continues to use the terms 'Sender' and 
   'Receiver' to refer to the 'FEC Sender' and 'FEC Receiver' 
   respectively. 

    

4.1. Signaling Protocol for Multicasting 

   A one-to-many signaling protocol is desired in order to effectively 
   deliver the FEC Framework configuration from one sender to many 
   receivers. The Session Announcement Protocol (SAP) version 2 
   [RFC2974] is used as the signaling protocol to multicast the 
   configuration information. The apparent advantage is that the server 
   doesn't need to maintain any state for any receiver using SAP. 

   At the high level, a sender, acting as the SAP announcer, signals the 
   FEC Framework Configuration Information for each FEC Framework 
   instance available at the sender, using the SAP message(s). The 
   configuration information, encoded in a suitable format as per the 
   section 3.1, is carried in the Payload of the SAP message(s). A 
   receiver, acting as the SAP listener, listens on a well known UDP 
   port and at least one well known multicast group IP address. This 
   enables the receiver to receives the SAP message(s) and obtains the 
   FEC Framework Configuration Information for each FEC Framework 
   Instnace.

Internet-Draft      FEC Framework Config Signaling        February 2008 
    

   Using the configuration information, the receiver becomes aware of 
   available FEC protection options, and may subscribe to one or more 
   multicast trees to receive the FEC streams using out-of-band 
   multicasting techniques such as PIM [RFC4601]. This, however, is 
   beyond the specification of this document. 

   SAP message is carried over UDP over IP. The destination UDP port 
   must be 9875 and source UDP port may be any available number. The SAP 
   message(s) SHOULD contain an authentication header and MAY be 
   subjected to the cryptography. One cryptography method suggested by 
   this specification is the usage of Group Cryptography as specified in 
   GDOI [RFC3547].

   While the RFC2974 includes explanation for each field, the most 
   interesting is the 'Payload' field. This field is required, by this 
   specification, to carry the the FEC Framework configuration 
   information. Subsequently, the 'Payload Type' field, which is a MIME

   content type specifier, must describe the encoding format used to 
   encode the Payload,. For example, the 'Payload Type' field may be 
   application/sdp if the FEC framework configuration information was 
   encoded in SDP format. Similarly, it would be application/xml if the 
   FEC framework configuration information was encoded in XML format. 

    

4.1.1. Sender Procedure 

   The sender signals the FEC framework configuration for each FEC 
   framework instance in a periodic SAP announcement message. The SAP 
   announcement message is sent to a well known multicast IP address and 
   port. The announcement is multicasted with the same scope as the 
   session it is announcing. 

   The SAP module at the sender obtains the FEC Framework configuration 
   information per Instance from the 'FEC Framework' module and places 
   that in the SAP payload accordingly. A single SAP (announcement) 
   message may carry the FEC Framework Configuration Information for 
   each FEC Framework Instance. This is a preferred method, though the 
   other method may be to aggregate more than one SAP (announcement) 
   messages in a single UDP datagram as long as the resulting UDP 
   datagram length is less than the IP MTU of the outgoing interface.  

   The IP packet carrying the SAP message must be sent with destination 
   IP address of either 239.16.33.254 (if IPv4 administrative scope 239. 
   is selected) or 224.2.127.254 (if IPv4 global scope 224.0.1.0-
   238.255.255.255 is selected) or FF0X:0:0:0:0:0:2:7FFE (if IPv6 is 
   selected, where X is the 4-bit scope value) with UDP destination port 
   9875. The default IP TTL value should be 255, though the 
   implementation should allow to set it to any other value. The IP DSCP 
   field may be set to any value that indicates a desired QoS treatment 
   in the IP network. 

   The IP packet carrying the SAP message must be sent with source IP 
   address that is reachable by the receiver. The sender may assign the 
   same IP address in the "originating source" field of the SAP message, 
   as the one used in the source IP address of the IP packet.  

   Furthermore, the FEC Framework Configuration Information must NOT 
   include any of the reserved multicast group IP addresses for the FEC 
   streams (i.e. source or repair flows), though it may use the same IP 
   address as the 'originating source' address to identify the FEC 
   streams (i.e. source or repair flows). Please refer to IANA 
   assignments for multicast addresses.

Internet-Draft      FEC Framework Config Signaling        February 2008 
    

   The sender must periodically send the 'SAP announcement' message. 
   This is required so that the receiver doesn't purge the cached 
   entry(s) from the database and doesn't trigger the deletion of FEC 
   Framework configuration information. While the time interval between 
   repetitions of an announcement can be calculated as per the very 
   sophisticated but complex formula explained in RFC2974, the preferred 
   and simpler mean is to let the user specify the time interval from 
   the range of 1-60 mins with suggested default being 10 mins. The 
   implementation of signaling protocol should provide the flexibility 
   to the operator to choose the complex method over the simpler method 
   of determining the SAP announcement time interval. Additionally, the 
   'time interval' should be signaled within the FEC Framework 
   configuration Information. 

   The sender may choose to delete the announced FEC framework 
   configuration information by sending a 'SAP deletion' message. This 
   may be used if the sender no longer desires to send any FEC streams. 
   If the sender needs to modify the announced FEC Framework 
   configuration Information for one or more FEC instances, then the 
   sender must send a new announcement message with a different 'Message 
   Identifier Hash' value as per the rules described in section 5 of 
   RFC2974. Such announcement message should be sent immediately 
   (without having to wait for the time-interval) to ensure that the 
   modifications are received by the receiver as soon as possible. The 
   sender must send the SAP deletion message to delete the previous SAP 
   announcement message (i.e. with the previous 'Message Identifier 
   Hash' value). 

    

4.1.2. Receiver Procedure 

   The receiver must listen on UDP port 9875 for packets arriving with 
   IP destination address of either 239.16.33.254 (if IPv4 
   administrative scope is selected) or 224.2.127.254 (if IPv4 global 
   scope is selected) or FF0X:0:0:0:0:0:2:7FFE (if IPv6 is selected, 
   where X is the 4-bit scope value). 

   The receiver, upon receiving a SAP announcement message, creates an 
   entry, if it doesn't already exists, in a local database and passes 
   the FEC Framework configuration information from the SAP Payload 
   field to the 'FEC Framework' module. When the same annoucement 
   (please see section 5 of RFC2974) is received the next time, the 
   timer of the corresponding entry should be reset to the three times 
   the time-interval value that is signaled by the sender or one hour, 
   whichever is greater.

   Editor's Note: SAP doesn't allow the time-interval to be signaled in 
   the SAP header. Hence, we need this to be specified in the FEC 
   Framework Configuration Information (allowed by SAP). For example, 
   the usage of "r=" (repeat time) field in SDP. 

   The receiver, upon receiving a SAP delete message, must delete the 
   matching SAP entry in its database. This should result in the 
   receiver no longer using the relevant FEC framework configuration 
   information for every instance, and should no longer subscribe to any 
   related FEC streams.  

    

4.2. Signaling Protocol for Unicasting 

    

   The signaling protocol for unicasting enables two nodes, which wish 
   to communicate one-to-one across an IP network, to exchange the FEC 
   Framework configuration Information. This exchange may be 
   unidirectional or bidirectional depending on the application desiring 
   the FEC protection for its communication.  

   For example, a multimedia (VoD) client may send a request via 
   unicasting for a particular content to the multimedia (VoD) server, 
   which may offer various options such as encodings, bitrates, 
   transport etc. for the content. The client selects the suitable 
   options and answers to the server, paving the way for the content to 
   be unicasted on the chosen transport from server to the client. This 
   offer/answer signaling, described in [RFC3264], is commonly utilized 
   by many application protocols such as SIP, RTSP etc. 

   The fact that two nodes desiring unicast communication almost always 
   rely on an application to first exchange the application related 
   parameters via the signaling protocol, it is logical to enhance such 
   signaling protocol(s) to (a) convey the desire for the FEC protection 
   and (b) subsequently also exchange FEC parameters i.e. FEC Framework 
   Configuration information. This enables the node acting as the 
   offerer to offer 'FEC Framework Configuration Information' for each 
   of available FEC instances, and the node acting as the answerer 
   conveying the chosen FEC Framework instance(s) to the offerer. The 
   usage of FEC framework instance i.e. FEC scheme is beyond the scope 
   of this document. Please refer to the FEC Framework document 
   [FECARCH]. 

   While enhancing the application's signaling protocol to exchange FEC 
   parameters is one method (briefly explained above), another method

   would be to have a unicast based generic protocol that could be used 
   by two nodes independent of the application's signaling protocol. The 
   latter method is under investigation and may be covered in future. 

    

4.2.1. SIP 

   SIP [RFC3261] is an application-level signaling protocol to create,  
   modify, and terminate multimedia sessions with one or more 
   participants. SIP also enables the participants to discover one 
   another and to agree on a characterization of a multimedia session 
   they would like to share. SIP runs on either TCP or UDP or SCTP 
   transport, and uses SDP to describe multmedia session attributes.  

   SIP already uses offer/answer model with SDP, described in [RFC3264], 
   to exchange the information between two nodes to establish unicast 
   sessions between them. This specification extends the usage of this 
   model for exchanging the FEC Framework Configuration Information, 
   explained in section 3, between two SIP speaking nodes. 

    

4.2.2. RSTP 

   RTSP [RFC2326] is an application-level signaling protocol for control 
   over the delivery of data with real-time properties. RTSP provides an 
   extensible framework to enable controlled, on-demand delivery of 
   real-time data, such as audio and video. RTSP runs on either TCP or 
   UDP transports.  

   RTSP already provides an ability to extend the existing method with 
   new parameters. This specification suggests requesting for the FEC 
   protection options by including "FEC Protection Required" in the 
   "Require:" header of SETUP (method) request message. The node 
   receiving such request either responds with "200 OK" message that 
   includes offers i.e. available FEC options (e.g. FEC Framework 
   Configuration Information for each Instnace) or "551 Option not 
   supported" message. 

   Node1->Node2:  SETUP < ... > RTSP/1.0 

                  CSeq: 1 

                  Transport: <omitted for simplicity> 

                  Require: FEC Protections Required

Internet-Draft      FEC Framework Config Signaling        February 2008 
    

   Node2->Node1:  RTSP/1.0 200 OK   |  or |  RTSP/1.0 551 Option Not 
   supported 

                  CSeq: 1           |     |  CSeq: 1 

                  Transport: <omitted for simplicity> 

    

   The requesting node (node1) may then send either the SETUP message 
   without using the Require: header, if the remote node didn't support 
   the "FEC protection", or a new SETUP message to request the selected 
   FEC protection streams. 

    

4.2.3. DSM-CC 

   DSM-CC is a predominant suite of protocols including the signaling 
   protocol used for the video control plane in Cable/MSO networks that 
   have offered video services for decades. Unfortunately, DSM-CC is 
   actually standardised in MPEG-2 ISO/IEC 13818-6 (part 6 of the MPEG-2 
   standard), not within the IETF yet, hence, DSM-CC related 
   enhancements aren't covered in this document. The same is applicable 
   to Session Setup protocol (SSP) and Lightweight Stream Control 
   Protocol (LSCP) that are derived from DSM-CC, as well. 

    

5. Security Considerations 

   There are no additional security consideration other than what's 
   already covered in RFC2974 for SAP, RFC2326 for RTSP, RFC3261 for SIP 
   etc. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   None. 

7. Conclusions 

   TBD. 

8. Acknowledgments
