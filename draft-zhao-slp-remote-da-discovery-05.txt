Internet Draft    Remote Discovery in SLP via DNS SRV  February 16, 2004


1. Introduction

   This document describes remote service discovery in the Service
   Location Protocol (SLP) [RFC2608] via DNS SRV [RFC2782]. We consider
   remote service discovery as discovering desired services in given
   remote DNS domains, and local service discovery as discovering
   desired services within the local administrative domain.

   SLP provides a scalable framework for local service discovery and
   selection. In SLP, User Agents (UAs) discover desired services in the
   local administrative domain by querying all Service Agents (SAs) via
   multicast or querying a Directory Agent (DA) via unicast. To query a
   DA using unicast, a UA needs to first learn about the DA via DHCP,
   static configuration or multicast (listening for DAAdvert multicast
   or issuing DA discovery SrvRqst multicast).

   DNS SRV provides a good support for remote service discovery.
   However, if multiple servers are discovered via DNS SRV for a
   service, only priority and weight can be used to make a selection. If
   additional service properties (such as cost, speed and service
   quality) need to be considered in the selection process, DNS SRV
   becomes insufficient.

   We propose that using SLP and DNS SRV together can provide a better
   support for remote service discovery. First, a UA uses DNS SRV to
   find SLP DAs at a remote DNS domain. Then, the UA queries one or more
   of those DAs to discover desired services. In this way, we can avoid
   the limitations in using SLP and DNS SRV separately. On one hand,
   without DNS SRV, an SLP UA needs to depend on static configuration to
   learn about remote DAs because DHCP and multicast DA discovery are
   not generally applicable beyond the local administrative domain. On
   the other hand, without SLP, DNS SRV has limited support for service
   selection.

   In this document, we first define the DNS SRV Resource Records (RRs)
   for SLP DA services, which are used to map a given DNS domain to
   remotely accessible (i.e., accessible from the Internet) DAs in that
   domain. Then, we discuss various issues in using SLP and DNS SRV
   together for remote service discovery. Finally, we give the steps for
   discovering desired services in remote DNS domains.

2. The DNS SRV RRs for SLP DA services

   According to RFC 2782 [RFC2782], the DNS SRV RRs for SLP DA services
   are defined as follows:

   _slpda._Proto.Name TTL Class SRV Priority Weight Port Target

   where "slpda" is the symbolic name for SLP DA services in Assigned
   Numbers [NUMBERS], the Proto field is either "tcp" or "udp", and the
   Target field is the domain name of an SLP DA. Please refer to
   [RFC2782] for detailed explanation of each field in DNS SRV RRs.

   Next we show an example of using DNS SRV RRs to map a given DNS
   domain to remotely accessible DAs in that domain. To discover
   remotely accessible DAs in a remote domain (say, example.com), a UA
   makes a DNS query [RFC1034,RFC1035] for QNAME=_slpda._tcp.example.com
   (or QNAME=_slpda._udp.example.com), QCLASS=IN, and QTYPE=SRV. Then
   the UA will receive a list of DNS SRV RRs in a DNS reply, which gives
   all remotely accessible DAs in the domain example.com, such as:

   ;;                             Priority Weight Port Target
   _slpda._tcp.example.com IN SRV 0        0      427  da1.example.com
   _slpda._tcp.example.com IN SRV 0        0      427  da2.example.com

3. Remote Service Discovery in SLP via DNS SRV

   SLP DAs can be discovered in two ways: (1) using the mechanisms
   described in RFC 2608; (2) using DNS SRV RRs as described in this
   document. The second approach is useful for UAs to acquire service
   information for remote domains. For example, a mobile node visiting a
   network (without the use of mobile IP) may want to obtain information
   about services in its home network.

3.1. The DNS Domain of Interest for Remote Service Discovery

   Using DNS SRV RRs to discover SLP DAs requires knowledge of the
   domain where SLP DAs are registered. For remote service discovery, we
   assume that the DNS domain of interest is known via a priori
   knowledge. For example, a UA is configured with a domain name or the
   user provides the domain name manually.

   Note that there is no implied "search order" of DNS domains in
   finding remote DAs. For instance, if a UA is looking for remote DAs
   in foo.bar.example.com, it SHOULD only look for
   _slp._tcp.foo.bar.example.com, and MUST NOT fall back to look for
   _slp._tcp.bar.example.com, _slp._tcp.example.com, and so on.

3.2. SLP DAs for Remote Service Discovery

   A UA discovers desired services in a given remote DNS domain by
   unicasting requests to DAs in that domain. The UA uses remote DAs
   according to these prioritized rules: (1) using DAs which it has been
   configured with; (2) using DAs which it has discovered via DNS SRV.

3.3. SLP Scopes for Remote Service Discovery

   As SLP scopes are intended to be used only within one administrative
   domain, they are likely incomprehensible to users outside of the
   administrative domain. Thus, any remotely accessible service MUST be
   registered in the "default" scope, but it MAY be registered in other
   scopes at the same time. Similarly, all DAs advertised via DNS SRV
   MUST serve the "default" scope, but they MAY serve other scopes at
   the same time. As a result, users wishing to discover services at a
   remote DNS domain SHOULD only search the "default" scope.

4. Steps for Remote Service Discovery

   The steps for a User Agent U to discover desired services in a remote
   domain D are as follows.

   (1) U makes a DNS query for QNAME=_slpda._tcp.D, QCLASS=IN, and
       QTYPE=SRV. Then U gets a list of DNS SRV RRs (referred to as L)
       in a DNS reply, which gives all remotely accessible DAs in D.

   (2) U selects a DA X based on the priority and weight information
       per RFC 2782.

   (3) U queries X in the "default" scope to discover desired services
       in D.

   Note that the services discovered in the above steps may not
   necessarily be remotely accessible.

5. Security Considerations

   To support remote service discovery, a domain exposes its service
   information to the Internet. Standard SLP authentication SHOULD be
   used to protect valuable service information. First, there is a risk
   that any SA could advertise any service on a DA accessible from the
   Internet. Such a DA SHOULD reject all registrations and
   deregistrations that cannot be authenticated. Secondly, to avoid
   disclosing unintended service information to remote users, a DA
   accessible from the Internet SHOULD at least authenticate service
   queries that are not in the "default" scope. Finally, the security
   considerations for DNS SRV [RFC2782] apply to this document.

6. Applicability Statements

   This specification describes remote service discovery in SLP via DNS
   SRV. It facilitates discovering services at a remote DNS domain if
   the domain name is known via a priori knowledge. However, it does not
   intend to solve the problem of Internet-wide service discovery.

   Users should be aware of two constraints in using DNS SRV to discover
   SLP DAs: (1) they SHOULD only use DNS SRV to discover DAs in the
   "default" scope, and (2) an administrator may choose to only register
   a subset of all DAs in the "default" scope via DNS SRV. Thus, to
   discover local DAs, implementations MUST use the standard SLP
   mechanisms per RFC 2608. In addition, implementations supporting this
   specification MAY use DNS SRV to discover local DAs in the "default"
   scope.

   As SLP scopes are not intended to be used outside the local
   administrative domain, all remote service discovery in SLP SHOULD be
   carried only in the "default" scope.

   Notice that the services discovered via DNS SRV and remote SLP DAs
   may not necessarily be remotely accessible.

7. IANA Considerations

   In the DNS SRV RRs for SLP DA services, the symbolic name for the
   Service field is "slpda", supported protocols are "tcp" and "udp".
   The following values are to be registered with IANA:

       Service Field      Protocol Field     Reference
       -------------      --------------     ---------
           slpda                tcp          [RFCxxxx]
           slpda                udp          [RFCxxxx]
