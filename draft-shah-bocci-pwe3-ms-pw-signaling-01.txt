     Abstract 

        The pseudowire switching [6] draft describes how a Pseudowire can 
        span across multiple PSN domains. This multi-segment PW (MS-PW) 
        threads through one or more PEs that are not the endpoints of the PW 
        and are called switching PE (S-PE). The switching PE at each hop is 
        configured a-priori with two single hops PW information that enables 
        it to conduct splicing between the two. The configuration of such 
        information at each S-PE for possibly thousands of MS-PWs is 
        cumbersome. We describe a mechanism whereby a S-PE can identify and 
        process the PW control signaling with the information present in the 
        signaling message in a manner that eliminates the requirement to 
        configure PW splicing information. In this mechanism source PE 
        inserts information about the destination PE and the PW endpoint that 
        is recognized by the receiving PE to identify his role as a switching 
        PE and engage in propagating the PW signal towards the destination 
        PE.

     1. Introduction 
         
     1.1. Scope 
         
        The multi-segment pseudo-wire requirements draft [5] describes a 
        multi-segment pseudo wire as a concatenation of multiple single 
        segment pseudo wires.  
        [6] describes a solution in which, at each hop, two pseudo wires are 
        configured; one-half of the pseudo wire to the preceding hop and 
        other half of the pseudo wire to the succeeding hop. When a switching

     Internet-Draft   Multi-segment Pseudo-Wire Signaling               2005 
         
        PE receives PW signal on any half of the pseudo wire, it triggers a 
        PW signal on the other half of pseudo wire in order for the signaling 
        to thread through each hop all the way to the destination. The 
        requirement of pre-configuring the segments of a pseudo wire at each 
        hop presents administrative overhead which increases as the number of 
        multi-segment pseudo wires increase. In addition, it limits the 
        flexibility of ultimate PE to dynamically re-route a multi-segment 
        pseudo wire through a different set of one or more switching PEs. 
        The goal of the solution proposed in this document is to: 
        o  Eliminate the need to pre-configure pseudo wire segments at 
           switching PEs. 
        o  Provide QOS information to each switching PE in order for them to 
           intelligently manage the network resources. 
        o  Build on, as far as possible, the existing pseudo wire control 
           protocol methodologies. 
        o  Provide mechanisms to build a backup pseudo wire. 

        The following sections describe the solution with definition of 
        additional information elements, the role of the source PE, switching 
        PE and target PE in the creation, maintenance and termination of the 
        multi-segment pseudo wire. The document does not describe the 
        permutations and combinations of different control planes and PSN 
        technologies. This subject is covered in detail in [6]. Among the 
        several cases described in [6], the only case undertaken in this 
        document is the multi-segment PW consisting of a concatenation of 
        single-segment pseudo wires that are signaled dynamically. The 
        signaling protocol proposed is based on the PW control protocol [3] 
        using Targeted LDP in Downstream Unsolicited mode. 
        The proposal in this document is intended as a logical progression 
        from the existing signaling standards for single-segment PWs. As 
        such, the basic signaling is kept simple.

                      Figure 2:   PW switching Reference Model 
        Figure 2 extends the single segment PW architecture to show a 
        generalized multi-segmented PW case. PE1 and PE3 provide PWE3 to CE1 
        and CE2. These PEs reside in different PSNs. A PSN tunnel extends 
        from PE1 to PE2 across PSN1, and a second PSN tunnel extends from PE2 
        to PE3 across PSN2. PWs are used to connect the Attachment circuits 
        (ACs) attached to PE1 to the corresponding ACs attached to PE3. Each 
        PW on the tunnel across PSN1 is stitched to a PW in the tunnel across 
        PSN2 at PE2 to complete the multi-segment PW (MS-PW) between PE1 and 
        PE3. PE2 is therefore the PW switching point and will be referred to 
        as the PW switching provider edge (S-PE). PW1 and PW3 are segments of 
        the same MS-PW while PW2 and PW4 are segments of another pseudo wire. 
        PW segments of the same MS-PW (e.g., PW1 and PW3) MUST be of the same 
        PW type. Note that although Figure 2 only shows a single S-PE, a PW 
        may transit more than one S-PE along its path.

               Figure 3:   PW Switching Interprovider Reference Model 
        Figure 3 shows the inter-provider reference model [5]. In this case, 
        the two PSNs are administered by provider 1 and provider 2 
        respectively. PE2 and PE3 represent both ASBRs for those providers, 
        and S-PEs for the inter-provider PWs. An MPLS interface is assumed 
        between PE2 and PE3, which are interconnected using an inter-provider 
        PSN tunnel.  
         
     1.3. Overview of the proposed solution 

        This document proposes signaling methodologies for U-PEs and S-PEs 
        such that a multi-segmented PW can be extended across multiple PSN 
        domains without having to configure the intermediate PE hops. The key 
        points of the procedure are briefly described below. Detailed 
        procedures are provided in subsequent sections. 
        o  Both U-PEs are locally configured with PW specific information 
           relevant to the PW ID FEC. 
        o  Each U-PE determines its role with respect to MS-PW signaling, 
           i.e., active or passive, based on local configuration of the MS-
           PW. If the local configuration does not specify it, a U-PE 
           compares its IP address with that of its peer U-PE. The higher 
           address value takes an active role and initiates the MS-PW 
           signaling, while the lower address value takes a passive role. The 
           passive U-PE waits for the MS-PW signaling message to arrive from 
           its peer.

     Internet-Draft   Multi-segment Pseudo-Wire Signaling               2005 
         
        o  The active U-PE (known as the source U-PE or SU-PE) prepares a MS-
           PW TLV and sends the MS-PW Label Mapping message to one or more 
           next hop T-LDP peers. Section 6. describes how the next hop can be 
           chosen. However, details of PW routing are outside the scope of 
           this draft.  
        o  The switching PE (S-PE) recognizes the MS-PW label-mapping message 
           based on the PW type, processes it, adds its own label, and then 
           forwards it to a subset of T-LDP peers, as described above. Note 
           that the S-PE may receive more than one MS-PW label-mapping 
           message for a given MS-PW FEC. The following sections describe how 
           this case is handled. 
        o  One or more copies of MS-PW label-mapping message may arrive 
           through one or more paths at the last PW segment where the Target 
           U-PE (TU-PE) resides. All the S-PEs on the target segment 
           recognize the TU-PE to be their T-LDP peer, and thus only send the 
           MS-PW Label Mapping message to that TU-PE.  
        o  The TU-PE may receive multiple MS-PW Label Mapping messages for 
           the same MS-PW FEC from the set of previous hop S-PEs. It selects 
           one as its primary path from a penultimate hop S-PE, processes the 
           message, and advertises the Label Mapping in the reverse 
           direction. If the methods proposed in Section 6. are not used, a 
           label release is issued for each of the received Label Mappings 
           that were not selected. This triggers a tear down of the dangling 
           PWs in the reverse direction that were not selected for return 
           path. Note however that the TU-PE can select a backup path at the 
           same time of the primary path. In this case, it issues a Label 
           Mapping message on both the primary and backup paths. All other 
           labels are released. 
        o  The selected penultimate hop S-PE finds the MS-PW record created 
           during the forward path processing and selects the previous hop 
           for the MS-PW in the reverse direction. 
        o  The MS-PW signaling in the reverse direction continues on to pin 
           down the bidirectional PW at each segment. Only one copy of MS-PW 
           Label Mapping message is expected to arrive at SU-PE, except when 
           the TU-PE attempts to establish a backup MS-PW at the same time. 
           The procedures in this case are explained later in this document. 
 
        The following sections discuss the detailed signaling procedures, TLV 
        definitions, QOS characteristics, resiliency, OAM handling, etc.

     2. Terminology 
         
        [5] provides terminology for multi-segment pseudo wires. 
         
        This document defines the following additional terms: 
         
        o  Source Ultimate PE (SU-PE). An Ultimate PE (U-PE), which assumes 
           the active signaling role and initiates the signaling for multi-
           segment PW.  
        o  Target Ultimate PE (TU-PE). An Ultimate PE (U-PE) that assumes the 
           passive signaling role. It waits and responds to the multi-segment 
           PW signaling message in the reverse direction. 
        o  Forward Direction: SU-PE to TU-PE. 
        o  Reverse Direction: TU-PE to SU-PE 
        o  Forwarding Direction: Direction of data plane traffic flow 
          
     3. Applicability 
         
        Content for this section will be added in a future revision of this 
        document. 
         
     4. Multi-segment Pseudo Wire Configuration 
         
        As per the PW ID FEC model, only the U-PEs are required to be 
        configured for the MS-PW. There is no configuration required at the 
        S-PEs for the MS-PW Signaling.  
         
        The information configured at the SU-PE is as follows: 
         
        o  PW type - This is a new PW type called "Multi-Segment PW" type to 
           be assigned by IANA.  
      
      
     Shah et al              Expires January  2006                  [Page 9] 
         
     Internet-Draft   Multi-segment Pseudo-Wire Signaling               2005 
         
        o  TU-PE's IP address. The IP address of the remote PE is always 
           configured for each PW. However, when the PW type is MS-PW, SU-PE 
           recognizes the difference in modus operandi that is required. 
        o  Active/Passive Signaling Role - This optional configuration 
           selects signaling role to be of type Active since this is the 
           Source U-PE. Note that when this configuration is used, a 
           corresponding configuration at the TU-PE is necessary. 
        o  QOS requirements for forward and reverse directions, such as PW 
           traffic parameters - the value used by all PEs. The manner in 
           which these traffic parameters are used to reserve resources and 
           apply admission control at PEs in the forward and/or reverse 
           directions (if applicable) is determined by local policy. The QOS 
           related configuration is OPTIONAL.   
        o  MS-PW type for the U-PE - the value used only by U-PEs and not S-
           PEs. The values correspond to the types as those defined for SH-PW 
           [4]. 
        o  MS-PW ID for the U-PE - the value used only by U-PEs and not S-
           PEs. The value has the same meaning as that defined SH-PW [3]. The 
           MS-PW ID is signaled in the MS-PW TLV and is different from the PW 
           ID in the PW ID FEC. This latter is renamed "Peer PW ID" and its 
           use is described in Section 11.  
        o  TTL - the value used by all S-PEs. This is OPTIONAL. 
        o  Creation of disjoint path backup PW for this MS-PW FEC. 
      
        The information configured at the TU-PE is a somewhat smaller set as 
        this PE plays a passive role in MS-PW signaling. 
         
        o  SU-PE's IP address - used to verify and accept MS-PW signal 
        o  Active/Passive Signaling Role - This optional configuration 
           selects signaling role to be of type Passive since this is the 
           Target U-PE. Note that when this configuration is used, a 
           corresponding configuration at the SU-PE is necessary. 
        o  QOS requirements for forward and reverse directions, such as PW 
           traffic parameters - the value used by all PEs. This is OPTIONAL. 
           Note that the QOS requirements contained in the Label Mapping 
           message in the forwarding direction takes precedence over the 
           configured information on the TU-PE.

     Internet-Draft   Multi-segment Pseudo-Wire Signaling               2005 
         
        o  MS-PW type for the U-PE - this must be the same value as the one 
           configured at the SU-PE. 
        o  MS-PW ID for the U-PE - this must be the same value as the one 
           configured at the SU-PE. 
        o  TTL - the value used by all S-PEs. This is OPTIONAL. 
      
     5. MS-PW Information in the Label Mapping Message 

        The following information is needed in the MS-PW signaling for PW ID 
        FEC 128. These additional fields are inside the MS-PW TLV. The 
        information for generalized ID FEC (129) is described later. 
        o  Direction. Set as either forward or reverse 
        o  SU-PE's IP Address 
        o  TU-PE's IP Address 
        o  PW role - active or passive. This is OPTIONAL. 
        o  MS-PW ID as configured at SU-PE and TU-PE. This PW ID has 
           relevance only at U-PEs. 
        o  MS-PW Type as configured at SU-PE and TU-PE. This PW type has 
           relevance only at U-PEs. 
        o  Hop count. Incremented by each S-PE 
        o  TTL. Set by SU-PE and decremented by each S-PE. When TTL becomes 
           zero, a Label Release is triggered in the reverse direction 
        o  PW relative forwarding priority: this is set to zero by the SU-PE 
           in the forward label mapping message. It is set to a value higher 
           than zero by the TU-PE in the one or many reverse label mapping 
           messages. If more than one PW is established, e.g. primary and 
           backup, the TU-PE uses this field to indicate to SU-PE the 
           priority order in which it intends to use the primary and backup 
           PW paths to forward traffic. When SU-PE receives the labels for 
           the successful paths, it will start forwarding traffic using the 
           label of the highest priority PW. It will also expect to receive 
           traffic over the label of that same PW.

     Internet-Draft   Multi-segment Pseudo-Wire Signaling               2005 
         
        o  Path TLV. LDP [RFC 3036] defines the use of a Path TLV to collect 
           the LSR hops during LDP signaling propagation. [6] describes the 
           use of a Path TLV in the MS-PW architecture to build path trace 
           through S-PEs. The MS-PW signaling leverages this construct to 
           ensure that the backup path is disjoint from the primary path. 
        o  Requested QOS TLV [7]. This is set by SU-PE. Each S-PE uses this
           to check availability of resources on the transport tunnel. This
           is OPTIONAL.  
        o  Available QOS TLV. This is set by SU-PE when signaling MS-PW and 
           modified by each S-PE upward or downward. The TU-PE and S-PEs may 
           use this as path selection criteria for MS-PW in the respective 
           direction. The SU-PE initializes the available QOS TLV same as 
           requested QOS TLV. This is optional and must be absent if 
           Requested QOS TLV is not present 

     6. Next Hop Selection 

        This scheme can make use of one or more of the following mechanisms 
        to choose the next hop. Details of these mechanisms and PW routing in 
        general, is outside the scope of this draft. This list is not 
        exclusive. 
         
        o  Each PE may intelligently choose the set of next hop PEs based on 
           I-BGP / E-BGP queries. For example, in the inter-provider case 
           shown in Figure 3, PE2 in provider 1 is an ASBR for AS1 and PE3 in 
           provider 2 is an ASBR for AS2. They both have E-BGP session 
           between each other and hence know about each other. PE2 and PE3 
           would also have T-LDP sessions between each other. Once the MS-PW 
           label mapping message reaches PE3 in AS2, it would use IGP/BGP to 
           reach the S-PE which is connected to another AS. 
        o  Each S-PE checks the QOS and load capacity in reverse direction, 
           enabling this S-PE to determine if it is a suitable S-PE for the 
           establishment of both directions of the PW.  
        o  If the S-PE is an ASBR, including the AS number in the MS-PW 
           signaling message and preventing propagation to an AS that it has 
           already traversed.

     Internet-Draft   Multi-segment Pseudo-Wire Signaling               2005 
         
        o  By configuring a "gateway" capability on each PE. In general, 
           there are many PEs on a PSN. Some may be U-PEs, some are S-PEs and 
           some are both. For S-PEs, some may be inter-area boundary nodes, 
           some may be inter-routing domain boundary nodes and some may be 
           inter-AS boundary nodes. Of these, some may be PW switching 
           capable while others are not. A service provider can select a 
           small set of PEs that are gateways and only those would process 
           the MS-PE signals. E-BGP, I-BGP does not use this attribute as a 
           criterion for the best next hop selection. Adding this additional 
           check further narrows the breadth of MS-PW signaling scope. 
        The use of these methods will minimize signaling overhead. 

     7. PW Loop Detection 

        In order to provide a loop detection mechanism, a S-PE MAY support 
        the OPTIONAL PW switching point TLV and associated procedures as 
        described in [6].  

     8. Explicit Route support 

        In some situations it may be required that the decision on which next 
        hop the S-PE should choose must be given to the source U-PE. For 
        example, there may be administrative reasons why PWs must be 
        constrained to particular route. Also, the SU-PE may have access to a 
        traffic-engineering database for its local domain and may wish to 
        determine the preferred exit point from its domain at a given time. 
        Mechanisms for PW routing are outside the scope of this draft. 
         
     9. Signaling procedures 

        The signaling procedures are described based on the direction in 
        which the MS-PW signaling message is traveling and how each PE 
        processes a message. The forward direction is considered to be from 
        the preceding to the succeeding side with respect to the SU-PE i.e. 
        from SU-PE to TU-PE. 
         
        The first step in the signaling procedure is the determination of the 
        role of the U-PE. When a PW is configured on a PE, it first 
        determines if the PW is of type MS-PW. Note that a MS-PW does not 
        necessarily mean that it has to pass through multiple PW segments. It 
        is entirely possible that TU-PE may be T-LDP peer of the SU-PE as it 
        resides on the same PSN domain. However, if the U-PE is not T-LDP 
        peer and the PW type is MS-PW, then each U-PE engages in determining 
      
      
     Shah et al              Expires January  2006                 [Page 13] 
         
     Internet-Draft   Multi-segment Pseudo-Wire Signaling               2005 
         
        its role in MS-PW signaling by checking the local configuration. If 
        such information is not configured, each U-PE compares his own IP 
        address with its peer's IP address. If the value is higher, U-PE 
        assumes an active role and initiates the MS-PW signaling message. 
        This will be a Label Mapping message. This U-PE is referred to as 
        Source U-PE, or SU-PE. The passive U-PE awaits this MS-PW signaling 
        message to arrive and is referred to as the TU-PE. 
         
     9.1. MS-PW signaling in the Forward Direction 
         
     9.1.1. The role of SU-PE 
       
        The SU-PE initiates the MS-PW signal in the forwarding direction.  
         
        The SU-PE dispatches PW signaling as described in [3]. The PW ID, 
        also known as the Peer PW ID, is set as described in Section 11. The 
        PW-type is set to the new "Multi-Segment PW" type. The MS-PW TLV is 
        added in the optional TLV field of the Label Mapping message and is 
        initialized as follows. 
         
        o  Direction field is set to Forward. 
        o  MS PW ID is set to the value configured locally by the user. 
        o  MS-PW TYPE is set to PWE3 service type as defined in [4] and is 
           based on the type of Attachment Circuit present at the U-PEs. This 
           value is configured by the user. 
        o  SU-PE IP address is configured as the IP address of the LDP 
           entity. 
            o TU-PE IP address is configured as IP of address of the TU-PEÆs 
               LDP entity. 
            o TTL is configured by the user. The TTL field represents the 
               maximum number of hops that MS-PW signal is willing to pass 
               through. 
            o Hop count is set to zero. 
      
      
     Shah et al              Expires January  2006                 [Page 14] 
         
     Internet-Draft   Multi-segment Pseudo-Wire Signaling               2005 
         
            o The optional QOS parameters are set in the QOS TLV to indicate 
               to each PE the QOS expectations for the reverse direction 
               traffic. Optionally, an additional QOS TLV can also be 
               dispatched marked as available QOS TLV. Each receiving PE can 
               then modify this TLV upward or downward fashion based on what 
               PW QOS can they honor. 
            o The PW relative forwarding priority is set to zero.  
            o Path TLV is included if Disjoint Backup path is desired. 
         
        The SU-PE sends a Label Mapping message in downstream unsolicited 
        fashion to one or more next hop targeted LDP peers. The same PW label 
        is advertised to each peer. An associated use count can be maintained 
        to account for number of T-LDP peers the MS-PW signal was sent to. 
        This is useful in processing Label Release messages from the T-LDP 
        peers.  
         
     9.1.2. The Role of S-PE 
         
        When a PE receives a Label Mapping message, it recognizes the PW to 
        be of type "Multi-Segment PW" based on the PW type. The PE determines 
        its role as an S-PE based on the IP address of the TU-PE present in 
        the MS-PW TLV. Note that the rationale for using the PW type field to 
        recognize MS-PW processing is to cover cases such as where the TU-PE 
        is a T-LDP peer of the SU-PE (i.e. SS-PW), where penultimate hop S-PE 
        processing the MS-PW, etc. 
         
        As an S-PE, the PE must qualify itself as a suitable candidate based 
        on the following criteria. Note that the following check list is in 
        addition to normal PE behavior in support of any PW signaling message 
        such as MTU, sequence number, fragmentation, etc. 
         
        o  Check against any configured policy (such as security, tariff, 
           etc) that prevents this from being a suitable S-PE for this 
           particular MS-PW signal. 
        o  Examine the QOS serviceability in the appropriate direction(s) 
           based on the QOS TLVs and local policy, if present. Note that the 
           S-PE checks for resources and commits once only for a given MS-PW 
           as identified by the triplet {SU-PE, TU-PE, MS-PW ID}.

        o  If the PE knows of any suitable next hop T-LDP peer. This also 
           includes the case where TU-PE is its T-LDP peer. 
        o  Decrementing the TTL results in TTL greater than zero.  
        o  If the MS-PW FEC already exists, then the MS-PW label mapping 
           message is a duplicate. The S-PE handles the duplicate MS-PW label 
           mapping message in the following manner to determine its 
           suitability in propagating the signal forward: 
            o Based on the local policy, the S-PE is not suitable for this 
               MS-PW.  
            o If the Peer PW ID received from the predecessor for the MS-PW 
               FEC is not unique, S-PE is not suitable for this MS-PW. 
            o If the next hop T-LDP peer is not a TU-PE and the only suitable 
               next hop T-LDP peer is the one already selected by a previous 
               instance of the MS-PW signal for this MS-PW FEC, then S-PE is 
               not suitable for this MS-PW. 
        o  Otherwise the S-PE is suitable. Note that allowing more than one 
           instance of a MS-PW label mapping to transit through an S-PE for 
           the same MS-PW FEC enables a previously disjoint backup path, 
           which converges at the S-PE, to continue forward as a partially 
           disjointed path.  
        If S-PE determines itself to be unsuitable for forwarding the MS-PW 
        signal, it issues the Label Release message to the sender of the 
        Label Mapping message. 
         
        If S-PE does determine that it is a suitable S-PE, it performs 
        following steps in order to forward the MS-PW signal. 
         
        o  Record the Peer PW ID, PW label and senders IP address. Note that 
           these values are unique for each MS-PW signaling message it 
           receives, and in particular that the Peer PW ID is significant 
           only within the context of the senderÆs IP address 
        o  Allocates the required QOS resources from the PSN tunnels in the 
           reverse direction.  
        o  Determine the next hop T-LDP peer(s). If the TU-PE is a T-LDP 
           peer, then this PE becomes the sole candidate. If not, then the 
           criteria used to select the candidates are not specified in this 
           document, but may be based on mechanisms specified in Section 6.  
           The IP address of each of these is recorded.

     Internet-Draft   Multi-segment Pseudo-Wire Signaling               2005 
         
        o  Allocate a new Peer PW ID and a PW label. Note that this Peer PW 
           ID uniquely represents this instance of MS-PW FEC.  
        o  Increment the hop count. 
        o  Decrement the TTL. 
        o  Adjust the Available QOS TLV, if present, based on the resources 
           it is willing to commit for the PW in the reverse direction. 
        o  If a use count is maintained, set the use count to the number of 
           T-LDP peers to which the MS-PW Label Mapping will be advertised. 
        o  Record the state of the PW. 
        o  If Path TLV is present, insert the S-PE's LSR Identifier. 
         
        The IP address of the SU-PE, MS-PW ID and TU-PE tuple along with the 
        newly created Peer PW ID can be used as the key to fetch the 
        information recorded for MS-PW. 
         
     9.1.3. The Role of TU-PE 
         
        The MS-PW signaling thus passes along the PW segments through one or 
        more S-PEs to arrive at the TU-PE. It is possible that some MS-PW 
        paths may perish mid-way for various reasons such as TTL becoming 
        zero, no suitable next hop, could not satisfy the QOS requirement, 
        etc. When an S-PE can not 'forward' the MS-PW signaling message, it 
        triggers a tear-down in the reverse direction of the MS-PW path 
        passing through it. 
         
        It is possible that the TU-PE may receive more than one MS-PW 
        signaling message. Each received MS-PW label mapping message 
        represents a PW path that varies from the other. The TU-PE may use 
        some heuristics and or policy to select one MS-PW as the primary PW 
        path. It is also possible to select one or more MS-PW paths as backup 
        PW paths.  
         
        A TU-PE performs the following procedures for each MS-PW Label 
        Mapping that a TU-PE receives: 
         
        o  Matches the MS-PW FEC with the configured PW-FEC.  
      
      
     Shah et al              Expires January  2006                 [Page 17] 
         
     Internet-Draft   Multi-segment Pseudo-Wire Signaling               2005 
         
        o  It 'responds' to the selected S-PE from which the Label Mapping 
           message was received with the MS-PW FEC TLV with the reverse 
           direction bit set. 
        o  A label release is sent to those S-PEs that were not selected with 
           reverse direction bit set. 
            o The TU-PE becomes the PW path terminator. For the unsuccessful 
               (i.e. un-selected) paths, reverse tear down is triggered by 
               the TU-PE. 
        o  The TU-PE is also responsible for triggering the reverse path 
           selection of its choice. This choice could be based on only the 
           penultimate hop S-PE from which it receives the forward direction 
           signaling message, or by comparing the available QOS TLV from 
           various signaling messages. 
        o  When a disjoint backup path is desired, the TU-PE uses the Path TLV
           of the selected primary path as the exclude list to select the 
           backup path (during reverse signaling propagation) that is disjoint. 

     9.2. MS-PW Signaling in the Reverse Direction 
         
     9.2.1. The Role of the TU-PE 
         
        The TU-PE is responsible for generating the MS-PW Label Mapping 
        message in the reverse direction for one or more MS-PWs if 
        applicable. The following procedures are performed for each reverse 
        MS-PW signaling message: 
         
        o  Set the direction flag to Reverse in the MS-PW TLV 
        o  Allocates a Label for the Label Mapping message 
        o  Use the Peer PW ID and MS-PW ID from the received Label Mapping 
           message unchanged. 
        o  Set the "PW relative forwarding priority" field of this PW path to 
           the desired value. A higher priority value indicates to the SU-PE 
           that this path is selected over all other paths to transmit 
           traffic in both directions. 
        o  Allocate the QOS resources from the PSN tunnel to the penultimate 
           hop S-PE. 
      
      
     Shah et al              Expires January  2006                 [Page 18] 
         
     Internet-Draft   Multi-segment Pseudo-Wire Signaling               2005 
         
        o  Issue a Label Release to the sender S-PE(s) for unselected MS-PW 
           Label Mapping messages for the same MS-PW FEC as identified by SU-
           PE IP address, MS-PW ID and TU-PE IP address. 
        It is possible that an S-PE may need to release Label Mapping message 
        during the reverse path MS-PW establishment. The S-PE would initiate 
        the path tear down in the preceding and the succeeding MS-PW 
        segments. The tear down of the specific instance of MS-PW path 
        propagates in both directions towards SU-PE and TU-PE as described in 
        section 9.1. 

     9.2.2. The Role of the S-PE 

        When an S-PE receives the MS-PW signaling message in the reverse 
        direction, it fetches the MS-PW record using the Peer PW ID present 
        in the MS-PW signal. It verifies the PW FEC using SU-PE IP address, 
        MS-PW ID and TU-PE IP address triplet. Note that the sender of the 
        MS-PW signaling message in the reverse direction is responsible for 
        using the same Peer PW ID that was received when handling the 
        corresponding MS-PW signal in the forwarding direction. The Peer PW 
        ID uniquely represents a specific instance of MS-PW FEC.  
         
        If the S-PE finds that a label was already installed for this MS-PW, 
        i.e., this is an attempt for a backup PW path it performs following 
        operations, 
            o If Disjoint Backup Path is dictated as indicated by the flag 
               in the signal or a local policy, it releases the reverse 
               direction label back to the sending S-PE or TU-PE.  
            o Otherwise, it selects the predecessor PE (and thus the reverse 
               direction) based on the Peer PW ID it received in the signal 
               that represent the specific instance of MS-PW path in 
               forwarding direction.   
         
        The S-PE performs a check of resources in the respective direction 
        based on the requested or available QOS TLVs and the CAC behavior 
        flag present in MS-PW Label Mapping message. If resources are not 
        available, the S-PE initiates path teardown in both directions 
        towards U-PEs for this instance of MS-PW path. 
         
        Once the S-PE has selected the downstream T-LDP peer for the reverse 
        path, it performs following steps for processing a MS-PW Label 
        Mapping in the reverse direction, 
         
      
      
     Shah et al              Expires January  2006                 [Page 19] 
         
     Internet-Draft   Multi-segment Pseudo-Wire Signaling               2005 
         
        o  The S-PE has a record of the MS-PW created during forward 
           processing of the same MS-PW signaling message. It fetches the 
           predecessorÆs IP address and PW ID and inserts that in the Label 
           Mapping message 
        o  Allocates a PW label for the forward data path for the Label 
           Mapping message 
        o  Programs the bidirectional PW as follows, 
            o Forward direction (SU-PE->TU-PE) using the label advertised to 
               the downstream T-LDP peer in the reverse direction MS-PW 
               signaling, and the label received from the upstream neighbor 
               for the reverse direction of the MS-PW signaling. 
            o Reverse direction (SU-PE<-TU-PE) using the label received from 
               the upstream neighbor and the label advertised to the 
               downstream neighbor during MS-PW signaling in the forward 
               direction. 
        o  Allocates the required QOS resources from the PSN tunnels in the 
           forward and reverse direction. 
        o  For all the predecessor's T-LDP peers that had advertised a MS-PW 
           Label Mapping in the forwarding direction but were not selected 
           for reverse path, the S-PE issues a Label Release message. 
        An S-PE may also receive a Label Release message for the MS-PW signal 
        that it had sent in the forwarding direction. As noted earlier, Peer 
        PW ID in the Label Release message represents a specific instance of 
        MS-PW path. However, when an S-PE is a fork for the MS-PW paths in 
        the forwarding direction, more than one instance of MS-PW paths map 
        to a single MS-PW path in reverse direction. In such case, a 'use 
        count' variable may be maintained. When the use count becomes zero 
        when decrementing for each reverse path Label Release message 
        received, a Label Release message is generated in the reverse path 
        towards the SU-PE.  

     9.2.3. The Role of SU-PE 
           
        The SU-PE is expected to receive one, or more if backup PWs are 
        supported, MS-PW signaling messages in the reverse direction. If more 
        than one Label Mapping message was received, the SU-PE will start 
        forwarding traffic using the label of the highest priority PW. It 
        will also expect to receive traffic over the label of that same PW. 
        In that case, a bi-directional, possibly multi-segmented, pseudo-wire 
      
      
     Shah et al              Expires January  2006                 [Page 20] 
         
     Internet-Draft   Multi-segment Pseudo-Wire Signaling               2005 
         
        has been set up between SU-PE and TU-PE. As a last step, the SU-PE 
        performs PW programming in its forwarding database to enable the 
        dataflow between the Attachment Circuit and the pseudo wire. 
           
        The SU-PE may also receive a set of Label Release messages, which 
        denote unsuccessful attempts to establishing the multi-segment PWs 
        through different paths. These messages are processed for clean-up 
        purposes.  
         
        It is also possible that none of the MS-PW signaling messages reached 
        the TU-PE and resulted in Label Release messages returning back for 
        the whole set. The SU-PE may choose to schedule a retry for such 
        cases or wait for operator intervention. 
         
     9.3. Signaling role 
         
        As per the discussion above the following is true. 
         
        1. SU-PE always  
            o Generates Label Mapping message (MS-PW Signal) in forward 
               direction.  
            o Processes Label Mapping message (MS-PW Signal) in reverse 
               direction. 
        2. TU-PE always 
            a. Processes Label Mapping message (MS-PW Signal) in forwarding 
               direction 
            b. Generates a Label Mapping message (MS-PW Signal) in reverse 
               direction in response to SU-PE MS-PW Signaling message (Label 
               Mapping).  
        3. S-PEs processes and propagates MS-PW signal in both direction. 
         
     10. PW status processing 

        A multi-segment PW includes the SU-PE, a set of one or more S-PEs and 
        a TU-PE. All members are responsible for maintaining a consistent 
        view of the PW status from end to end. If a defect occurs at any mid 
        point, the S-PE detecting the failure is responsible for generating 
        PW status to its preceding and succeeding T-LDP peers. Upon receipt 
      
      
     Shah et al              Expires January  2006                 [Page 21] 
         
     Internet-Draft   Multi-segment Pseudo-Wire Signaling               2005 
         
        of such (PW Status) messages, an S-PE is responsible for processing 
        and propagating along in the forwarding direction (i.e. in the 
        opposite direction from where it received). In essence, a PW Status 
        message generated at the midpoint should ripple through the rest of 
        the PW segments in both the directions towards the endpoints. The S-
        PEs should only use forwarding/not-forwarding status and should leave 
        the incoming/outgoing breakdown of the status bits to the U-PEs only. 
        In addition, whenever an S-PE receives a PW status message, it must 
        check the forwarding capabilities between the two PW segments. If one 
        or both PSN tunnels fails, it should mark the PW status accordingly 
        before propagating it in the forwarding direction. This is important 
        for handling the simultaneous multiple midpoint failures at different 
        PW segments for a given multi-segment PW. 
         
        The PW Status TLV is OPTIONALLY included in the Label Mapping 
        messages generated by the SU-PE, S-PEs and TU-PEs.  
      
     11. Peer PW ID 

        Traditionally, the PW ID represents a handle that each PE uses as a 
        key to fetch the Pseudo wire related information. For MS-PWs, we have 
        introduced the MS-PW ID that resides in the MS-PW TLV. The MS-PW ID 
        is relevant only to U-PEs. The PW ID present in the PW FEC of the 
        Label Mapping message is re-defined in this proposal as Peer PW ID.  
         
        The Peer PW ID is dynamic in nature for S-PEs such that the sender of 
        the Label Mapping message 'allocates' a new PW ID for each received 
        PW FEC used in MS-PW Signal. The receiver of the Label Mapping 
        message is responsible for: 
         
        o  Recording the PW ID of the sender. 
        o  Using the PW ID of the sender a.k.a Peer PW ID, whenever it sends 
           an LDP message for MS-PW. This includes Label Messages (mapping, 
           withdraw and release) and Notification messages (PW status, PW QOS 
           updates, etc). 
        o  Using its own PW ID when communicating with the downstream T-LDP 
           peer since he was the sender of the MS-PW Signal. 
        o  There are no new PW IDs generated for the MS-PW Signal traversing 
           in the reverse path. That is, PW IDs are generated only when 
           signaling a MS-PW in forward direction. 
        o  On the return path, each PE (starting with TU-PE) would use its 
           predecessor's PW ID in the PW ID FEC.

     12. Mechanisms for using Generalized ID FEC 
         
        The generalized ID FEC (GID FEC) consists of SAI, TAI and AGI 
        information. The SAI holds IP address (as present in LDP-ID) and 
        Attachment Identifier information for the SU-PE, while the TAI holds 
        IP address (as present in LDP-ID) and Attachment Identifier 
        information for the TU-PE. The AGI MAY represent the VPN identifier, 
        for example. 
         
        The GID FEC eliminates the need for some of the information present 
        in MS-PW TLV. However, for consistency, it is recommended that MS-PW 
        TLV should be included. It also eliminates the need for generating a 
        PW ID at each hop in the forwarding path as is the case PW ID FEC. 
         
        The signaling procedures for the SU-TE, S-PEs and TU-PE remain the 
        same as described above. Each MS-PW signaling message needs to be 
        processed within the context of the direction MS-PW signal is 
        flowing. In single-sided signaling, TU-PE does not have to be 
        configured with MS-PW specific information. 
      
        We note an exception to the handling of the generalized ID FEC. As 
        per [3], the receiver of GID FEC must respond 'immediately' either 
        with a corresponding Label Mapping message or with a Label Release 
        message. An exception is required when handling MS-PW Signaling, 
        whereby the recipient of the MS-PW signal must wait for corresponding 
        MS-PW Label Mapping, or a Label Release in the reverse direction. 
        This is not a significant deviation from the common practice as there 
        is no requirement that sender bind a Label Mapping message with a 
        timer and issue a Label Withdraw if a response is not received with 
        certain time. 
         
     13. Resiliency 
         
        The multi-segment pseudo wire set up is an involved process and the 
        nodal failures are not protected without having to initiate another 
        MS-PW setup. Hence it is prudent to provide a mechanism whereby 
        backup MS-PW(s) are setup during initial MS-PW establishment. 
         
        The proposed scheme described in this document is well suited for 
        this requirement as multi path PWs can be generated during initial

        MS-PW setup. When TU-PE receives multiple MS-PW signals, it may 
        select one or more Backup PW paths and set its priority in the MS-PW 
        TLV. The S-PEs continue to process and forward the MS-PW signaling in 
        the reverse direction in the same manner as the primary PW. It is 
        possible that reverse path signaling may not succeed. For this 
        reason, TU-PE should try to initiate multiple PW backup path setup 
        through different penultimate hop S-PEs.  
         
        The Backup PWE3(s) remain established and available to become the 
        primary PW. The SU-PE and TU-PE let the data flow only on the primary 
        PWE3. The following criteria or policies can be used by the SU-PE and 
        TU-PE to switch the data flow to a higher priority backup PW. 
          . Primary PW is torn down - e.g. in the case of a S-PE nodal 
             failure 
          . Primary PW is in the non-forwarding state for a long time e.g. 
             due to one or more PSN tunnel failures at mid points 
         
        In either case, switch over must be co-ordinated between SU-PE and 
        TU-PE.  
         
        The details of this or other schemes will be discussed in the future 
        revisions. 
         
     14. Scalability 

        In this scheme, the label resources are used efficiently.  The scheme 
        allows a high probability of finding the most suitable PW path 
        without needing a crank back mechanism, creation of one or more 
        disjoint backup pseudo wire paths during the initial setup, etc. 
        Signaling overhead is minimized through the use of mechanisms 
        described in Section 6.  
         
     15. Aspects for Further Study 
         
        The following aspects will be addressed in a future revision: 
         
        o  Applicability of this solution is addressing the requirements of 
           [5]. 
        o  How traffic is switched from primary to backup PWs on failure of 
           the primary. 
        o  MS-PWs in the context of a carrier's carrier environment.
