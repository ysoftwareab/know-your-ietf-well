Abstract

   This document introduces a command set standard to the web-based
   "Network Looking Glass" software.  Its purpose is to provide
   application programmers uniform access to the Looking Glass service
   and to analyze standardized response.

   The interface is supposed to provide the same level of information as
   web-based interfaces, but in a computer-readable format.

1.  Introduction

   Many Internet service providers (ISPs) and Internet exchange points
   (IXPs) offer a complimentary web-based service to their customers and
   the general public that gives insights to the backbone routing table,
   BGP neighbor information, or offered routes.  This service is known
   as a "Network Looking Glass".  Because they utilize a web-based
   interface, it is hard to automate access to the services and make
   that automation transferable between different service
   implementations.

   This document describes a common command set to provide application
   programmers uniform access to Looking Glass services.

   The commands are intended to provide the same level of information as
   available via web-based interfaces, but to do so in a computer-
   readable format.  The intention is that multiple implementers of

Internet-Draft          Looking Glass command set          November 2018


   Looking Glass services can provide access through these commands so
   that an application can make use of the different implementations.

   The command set is split into mandatory-to-support, optional, and
   additional.  The commands are extensible for new features and for
   value-add by implementations.

   The Looking Glass command set is described as a language-independent
   concept.  Consequently, any programming language, which satisfies the
   commands listed in the following chapters, is acceptable.

   This work is not the output of the IETF and is presented in the hope
   that Looking Glass implementers will offer a common programmable
   interface.

1.1.  Background

   The requirement of a uniform access to a Looking Glass service
   becomes important when multiple Looking Glasses are part of a
   monitoring system.  Implementing a web client and HTTP-parser for
   every kind of web-based Looking Glass is a time-consuming workaround.
   However, the Looking Glass command set is a much more viable,
   compatible, and scalable solution.

1.2.  Syntax Notation

   This specification uses the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) of
   [RFC8259] arranged as JSend (Appendix A) compliant responses.

1.3.  Examples

   All URLs in this documentation use the reserved sample domain of
   "example.net" as defined in [RFC6761] section 6.5.

   The URLs further use the fixed [RFC5785] prefix of ".well-known/
   looking-glass" to prevent a collision in the domains namespace.

   IPv4 addresses use the documenation block of 192.0.2.0/24 [RFC5737]
   and IPv6 addresses reside in the reserved prefix of 2001:DB8::/32
   [RFC3849].  BGP Autonomous System numbers are chosen from the private
   AS range defined in [RFC6996].

   The examples skip some required parameters for reasons of simplicity.

2.  Operation

   A client issues a query using the HTTP GET method to request specific
   resources from the server.  The resource is a URI and can be
   informational or a command execution.  The client must present all
   necessary parameters for the server to execute the command on the
   selected router.  Every call is stateless and independent of the
   previous one.

   The path component of the resource URI must use the prefix of ".well-
   known/looking-glass" (see Section 5.1) to stay namespace neutral.

   The "call" is a request from the client, which specifies a pre-
   defined operation ("function") that the server will execute on a
   selected router.  The "command" is a task executed on the router and
   initiated by the server on behalf of the client.  The type and scope
   of all commands are defined and limited by the server.  The client
   must not be able to execute random commands on the targeting router.
   There must not be any direct communication between the client and the
   router.

   After the execution of the command on the selected router has
   finished, the server replies to the client if the operation has
   either succeeded, failed or timed out.  The response is sent to the
   client in JSON format.  The communication protocol used between the
   server and router is not specified by this document; any method (e.g.
   Telnet, SSH, NETCONF, serial console) is acceptable.

   All parameters and its values are case-insensitive.

2.1.  Method Parameters

   Method parameters are mandatory components of the URI and placed in
   the "path" section in terms of [RFC7320].  Basically, the method
   parameters specify the call and determine which command the client
   wants to be executed on the selected router.

2.2.  Query Parameters

   Query parameters are optional components of the URI and placed in the
   "query" section in terms of [RFC7320].  Generally, the query
   parameters are additional instructions for the requested command.

   protocol
      Restrict the command and method parameters to use the specified
      protocol and version.  Protocol is selected as "Address Family
      Identifier" [IANA-AFN] [RFC4760] and optional "Subsequent Address
      Family Identifier" [IANA-SAFI] separated by comma.

Internet-Draft          Looking Glass command set          November 2018


      Default value is 1,1 (IP version 4, unicast).
      JSON datatype is String.
      Examples:

      *  protocol=2,1 (IP version 6, unicast)

      *  protocol=26 (MPLS, no SAFI used)

   router
      Run the command on the router identified by its name.  This is not
      necessarily the router's hostname as long as the Looking Glass
      software recognizes it.
      Default value is the first router in the list of available
      routers.
      JSON datatype is String.
      Example: router=rbgn06.example.net

   routerindex
      Run the command on this router identified by its position in the
      list of available routers.
      Default value is "0".
      JSON datatype is Number.
      Example: routerindex=8

   random
      Append a random string to prevent the client (or an intermediate
      proxy) from caching the response.  The server must ignore its
      value.
      No default value.
      JSON datatype is String.
      Example: random=517A93B50

   vrf
      Run the command from the selected routing table.  This parameter
      is valid only on routers that support "Virtual Routing and
      Forwarding" (VRF).
      No default value.
      JSON datatype is String.
      Example: vrf=mgmt

   runtime
      Stop executing the command after the runtime limit (in seconds) is
      exceeded.  A value of 0 disables the limit.
      Default value is "30".
      JSON datatype is Number.
      Example: runtime=60

      Request the server to provide the output (if any) in the selected
      format.  Specify multiple formats separated by comma in descending
      order of preference.  See Section 3.3.2 for more details.
      Default value is "text/plain" (raw/unformatted output).
      JSON datatype is String.
      Example: format=application/yang,text/plain

2.3.  Response

   The HTTP response header contains an appropriate HTTP status code as
   defined in [RFC7231] with the Content-Type set to "application/json".

   The HTTP body contains details and error descriptions.  The response
   text must comply with the JSON syntax specification JSend, which is
   briefly explained in Appendix A.  Consequently every response must
   contain a "status" field of either "success", "fail", or "error",
   that are explained in the following sections.

2.3.1.  Success

   A successful response must set the "status" field to "success".  It
   must also contain a "data" object including the following
   information:

   performed_at
      combined date and time in UTC ISO 8601 [iso8601] indicating when
      the operation finished.  This information must be present.

   runtime
      amount of seconds (wallclock) used to run the command.  This
      information must be present.

   router
      the name of the router, that executed the command.  This
      information may be present.

   output
      output of the command in a format that was requested by the client
      or defaults to raw output as it appeared on the router's command
      line interface (CLI).  It might even be blank if the command did
      not produce any output.  This information should be present.

   format
      selected output format by the server.  The client might request
      multiple formats, so that the "Looking Glass" server has to choose
      the best option and tell the client which format was selected.
      This information should be present (or defaults to "text/plain" if
      missing).

Internet-Draft          Looking Glass command set          November 2018


   Adding more information to the response is permitted and must be
   placed inside the "data" object.

   The HTTP status code should be 200.

   Example:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json
   {
     "status" : "success",
     "data" : {
       "router" : "route-server.lookingglass.example.net"
       "performed_at" : "2014-10-15T17:15:34Z",
       "runtime" : 2.63,
       "output" : [
         "full raw output from the observing router..."
       ],
       "format" : "text/plain"
     }
   }

2.3.2.  Fail

   A status of "fail" indicates that the selected command was executed
   on the router but failed to succeed.  The response message must set
   the "status" field to "fail" and must contain the "data" object with
   command-specific content, that is listed in Section 2.3.1.

   The HTTP status code should be 200.

   Example:

   HTTP/2.0 200 OK
   {
     "status" : "fail",
     "data" : {
       "performed_at" : "2014-10-18T20:04:37Z",
       "runtime" : 10.37,
       "output" : [
         "Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 192.0.2.5",
         ".....",
         "Success rate is 0 percent (0/5)"
       ],
       "format" : "text/plain",
       "router" : "route-server.lookingglass.example.net"
     }
   }

Internet-Draft          Looking Glass command set          November 2018


2.3.3.  Error

   The status "error" represents an error which occurred in processing
   the request or the command timed out.  The response message must set
   the "status" field to "error" and must contain the "message" key,
   that keeps a meaningful message, explaining what went wrong.

   The response may contain the "data" key, with required values listed
   in Section 2.3.1.  It may also include a "code" field, that carries a
   numeric code corresponding to the error.

   The HTTP status code should be 400 in case of a client-side error,
   500 in case of a server-side error or 502 for errors occurring on the
   target router.  Code 504 should be used when a command timed out.

   Example:

   HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
   {
     "status" : "error",
     "message" : "Unrecognized host or address."
   }

3.  Functions

   The Looking Glass command set provides functions that are either
   mandatory or optional to implement.  The same principle applies to
   the web-based Looking Glass.

   It is not possible for any function to modify the server's state.
   Therefore, all HTTP methods are GET operations.

   Variables are templated and expanded in harmony of [RFC6570].

3.1.  Diagnostic commands

3.1.1.  Ping

   Send echo messages to validate the reachability of a remote host and
   measure round-trip time.  The host can be a name or address.

3.3.  Organizational commands

   The following organizational commands must be included in the
   implementation.

3.3.1.  router list

   The command provides a full list of routers that are available for
   command execution.  This list includes the router ID and its name.
   It is equivalent to the common "router" HTML drop-down form element
   and contains the same information.

   Syntax: https://example.net/.well-known/looking-glass/v1/routers

   Example response:

   {
     "status" : "success",
     "data" : {
       "routers" : [
         "route-server.lookingglass.example.net",
         "customer-edge.lookingglass.example.net",
         "provider-edge.lookingglass.example.net"
       ],
       "performed_at" : "2014-10-19T20:07:01Z",
       "runtime" : 0.73
     }
   }

Internet-Draft          Looking Glass command set          November 2018


3.3.2.  router details

   List additional information about the selected router, specified by
   its router index.  The response must contain the routers hostname and
   router index.  The response may contain more details like output
   format, country code, city, administrative contact, vendor and model.

   Available output formats are specified by Internet media type as of
   [RFC6838] and listed in [IANA-MT].  If the routers support multiple
   formats, they are separated by comma.

   The router might provide output formats, that are not yet registered
   or listed in [IANA-MT].  [RFC6838] provides a tree for unregistered
   subtypes.  For example, output in NETCONF format could use "text/
   x.netconf".

   Missing output format defaults to "text/plain", which is a copy of
   the raw command-line output.

   Syntax: https://example.net/.well-known/looking-glass/v1/
   routers/{number}

   Example query:

   GET /.well-known/looking-glass/v1/routers/1
   Host: example.net

   Example response:

   {
     "status" : "success",
     "data" : {
       "id" : 1,
       "name" : "customer-edge.lookingglass.example.net",
       "format" : "text/plain,text/x.netconf",
       "country" : "de",
       "autonomous_system" : 64512
     }
   }

3.3.3.  commands

   This function provides a full list of commands that are available for
   execution.  The list includes mandatory, optional, and additional
   (Section 3.4) commands.  It is equivalent to the "command" HTML drop-
   down or radio-button form element and contains the same information.

Internet-Draft          Looking Glass command set          November 2018


   The list is formatted as "commands" array containing one object per
   command.  This object contains informative strings about the current
   command: href, arguments, description and command.

   Syntax: https://example.net/.well-known/looking-glass/v1/cmd

   Example response:

   {
     "status" : "success",
     "data" : {
       "commands" : [
         {
           "href" : "https://example.net/.well-known/     [multiline]
                             looking-glass/v1/show/route",
           "arguments" : "{addr}",
           "description" : "Print records from IP routing table",
           "command" : "show route"
         },
         {
           "href" : "https://example.net/.well-known/     [multiline]
                             looking-glass/v1/traceroute",
           "arguments" : "{addr}",
           "description" : "Trace route to destination host",
           "command" : "traceroute"
         }
       ]
     }
   }

3.4.  Extensible commands

   The list of commands may be expanded as long as the principles of
   this document are observed.

   For example, a Looking Glass provider may not be offering BGP-related
   commands because of an OSPF-based network.

   The sample command might be:

   GET /.well-known/looking-glass/v1/show/ospf/database
   Host: example.net

4.  Miscellaneous

   The network traffic sent by a "Looking Glass" is not appropriate when
   measuring Service Level Agreements or validating Quality of Service
   setting.

Internet-Draft          Looking Glass command set          November 2018


   If a monitoring system uses the Looking Glass command set for
   reachability checks, it should not rely on the HTTP status codes but
   on the "status" message field inside the HTTP body.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Well-Known URIs Registry

   This specification registers a Well-Known URI [RFC5785] (registration
   pending):

   URI Suffix: looking-glass

   Change Controller: M.Stubbig

   Specification Document(s): This document, Section 2

6.  Security Consideration

   The use of HTTPS is required to ensure a high level of security,
   privacy, and confidentiality during transit.

6.1.  Abuse Potential

   The main goal of the Looking Glass command-set is the automated usage
   of the Looking Glass service.  This allows the scripting of API
   calls, which could be used as a distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
   attack.  It is recommended that implementers of the Looking Glass API
   take steps to mitigate the above described abuse.  The strategy can
   include blocking or rate-limiting by client IP address or target IP
   network.

6.2.  Authentication

   Authentication is not a requirement because the current Looking Glass
   web services are usable without authentication.  Requests to the
   proposed API service may be authenticated by any method.  The
   decision is up to the implementers security requirements.

6.3.  Minimal information

   Some of the described commands provide a detailed insight into the
   providers network.  It is therefore up to the implementer's security
   policy to dismiss commands that are marked as "optional" or restrict
   commands that are marked as "mandatory".

Appendix A.  JSend

   According to [JSend], "JSend is a specification that lays down some
   rules for how JSON responses from web servers should be formatted.
   JSend focuses on application-level (as opposed to protocol- or
   transport-level) messaging which makes it ideal for use in REST-style
   applications and APIs."

   A basic JSend-compliant response must contain a "status" key and
   should contain "data", "message" and "code" keys dependent on the
   status value.  The following table lists the required and optional
   keys.
