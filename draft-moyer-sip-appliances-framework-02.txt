Abstract 
    
   This document proposes the use of SIP for network-capable 
   appliances. It leverages the standard SIP capabilities to directly 
   communicate with appliances even when they are behind firewalls, 
   NATs or other entities that prevent direct end-to-end communication. 
   When combined with a new method type and the SIP event extensions 
   these techniques become even more powerful.

1  Introduction 
   The next wave of the Internet is widely predicted to be the move 
   towards the Networked Appliance (NA); The Fridge that can keep an 
   inventory of your groceries and re-order when necessary or perhaps 
   the alarm clock that can co-ordinate your agenda, the weather and 
   the road conditions to determine the correct time to wake you up. It 
   is clear that these appliances will need to communicate amongst 
   themselves so that, for example, the alarm clock can turn on the

   bedroom lamp, but the mechanism these appliances will use to 
   communicate is far from obvious. This document provides the 
   rationale behind the requirement for the standardization of these 
   mechanisms and describes how to use the SIP architecture to meet 
   these requirements. It further provides examples of how SIP can be 
   used for this purpose. 
    
   For the purpose of this document, Networked Appliances (NAs) are 
   defined as dedicated (or limited) function consumer devices 
   containing at least one networked processor. Examples include lamps, 
   coffee makers and alarm clocks.  Figure 1 provides an example of a 
   home domain containing Networked Appliances.

1.1 Intra-Home Communication 
   The primary advantage of using SIP for Network Appliances is that it 
   provides connectivity across a wide area network. It is possible 
   that within a home, devices are connected using existing 
   technologies like X.10, Jini etc. It is also possible that SIP could 
   be used within a home for device communication as a replacement 
   technology for the existing intra-home protocols.  Further, it can 
   be envisioned that both SIP and other protocols co-exist within a

   Internet Draft          SIP Appliances              June 2001 

   home (domain). Though this document stresses primarily inter-domain 
   connectivity, it is equally possible to deploy SIP for intra-domain 
   connectivity. 
    
   For the purposes of this document, a home is considered to be a 
   single (DNS) domain. 
    
   Inter-device communication within a single domain can be subdivided 
   into two essential issues; the location and identification of the 
   device it is desired to talk to and then the communication with it. 
   Some approaches separate these two issues explicitly although most 
   tend to merge them into a single solution. There are numerous 
   emerging standards for in-home inter-device communication (HAVi [4], 
   VESA Home Networking [7], JINI [6] and UPnP [3] being four obvious 
   examples) and there are other standards explicitly dedicated to 
   location and identification of services (SLP [13] and Salutation [5] 
   for example).  
   Even allowing for the proliferation of intra-home communication 
   standards, it is possible to identify a number of features that are 
   common to each of them, as follows; 
    
  -  The rules that lead appliances to contact each other will either 
     be coded in the appliance, or possibly downloaded from network 
     servers. 
  -  These rules will be written in protocol specific terms such as 
     Send a message to controller at IP address 10.23.45.67 port 2357, 
     turn on item number 4555.  
  -  The way in which the mapping from protocol specific descriptions 
     to human user-friendly descriptions is standard dependant, and is, 
     in general, one of the less well developed aspects of the 
     standards. 

1.2 Extra-Home communication 
   The development of techniques for access into the home from outside 
   of it has not received anything like the attention that the in-home 
   communication problem has. This is reasonable, given that one is 
   predicated on the other.  
    
   There are a number of additional factors that need to be 
   accommodated when considering communication outside of the home, 
   notably; 
  -  Security û In-home communication exploits a level of physical 
     security that is lost when arbitrary access from outside of it is 
     permitted. 
  -  Authentication û The entity trying to enter into the home needs to 
     be unambiguously identified prior to permitting access.

   Internet Draft          SIP Appliances              June 2001 

  -  Reliability û Because of the wide-area nature of extra-home 
     access, there are more points of failure. The home should continue 
     to operate independently of external systems when communication 
     with them is lost. 
  -  Scaling û there are very many homes. 
  -  Protocol Independence û Although within a single home it is 
     acceptable that many different protocols are used for inter-device 
     communication, a much more protocol-independent approach is 
     required for the wide area, since the exact details of the devices 
     comprising the in-home network may not be known from the outside 
     world. 
  -  Naming and Location û Devices within the home need to be 
     unambiguously named and their location identified from outside of 
     it. 
    
   Techniques are being developed to act as a beach-head into the home 
   from the outside world, most notably by the Open Services Gateway 
   Initiative (OSGi) [2] but this still does not address the general 
   problem of wide area access, with the considerations above taken 
   into account. Platforms such as the OSG may serve as the basis for 
   such a set of techniques, however. 

2  The Use of SIP for Extra-home communication 
   This document outlines an architecture initially explicitly targeted 
   to appliances but with more general applicability to any networked 
   device, in which the location phase and communication (or action) 
   phases are merged into a single activity. The requesting agent sends 
   an instruction to perform an action on a named object in a message. 
   The message contains the name of the object upon which the action 
   should be performed as its address, and the action itself as the 
   payload. This message is routed from agent to agent, resolving the 
   name as it goes along.  
    
   For example, the command Switch on the lamp in the master bedroom in 
   DaveÆs house is first routed to the server that knows where DaveÆs 
   house is. Then the message is onward routed to the DaveÆs house 
   firewall, where access control and authorization is performed. If 
   this is successful, the message payload is then delivered to the 
   device to perform whatever action has been requested. 
    
   We may easily observe that many of these concepts are already 
   present in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  SIP performs 
   exactly this routing by name function in the INVITE process. An 
   INVITE is sent first to an agent, or proxy, for the name. The Proxy 
   can rewrite the name and relay the INVITE, getting closer to the 
   eventual destination for the message, delivering the payload (which 
   is conventionally Session Description Protocol (SDP)) once it 
   arrives. The Location and Action processes are intertwined in the 
   S. Moyer et al.        Expires December 2001               [Page 6] 

   Internet Draft          SIP Appliances              June 2001 

   same procedure. In addition, the SIP security architecture enables 
   verification based on these high level names. On initial 
   consideration, it appears that SIP is capable of performing the 
   functions identified above. 
    
   There is, however, one essential difference between the capabilities 
   of SIP and the identified requirements ù Addressing ù SIP URIs are, 
   in practice, Internet DNS addresses. If this difference can be 
   addressed, SIP becomes a very practical method of communicating with 
   appliances. 

2.1 Modifications and Extensions 
   To address the issues identified above, the following modifications 
   are proposed to SIP. These modifications and extensions are 
   described in more detail in the Internet-Drafts [8] and [9]. 

2.1.1   Addressing 
   In SIP, the names that are found in the To: and From: fields are 
   encoded as Universal Resource Locators (URL). Current 
   implementations support SIP and PHONE URLs. One could define a new 
   type of URL without changing the nature of the protocol.  This 
   allows for ôuser friendlyö discovery of the appliance address. An 
   example, could use a format similar to the service URL syntax 
   defined in RFC2609 but without the location information (which has 
   already been determined via the SIP routing) and without the ôslp: 
   prefix would be: 
    
     d=lamp,r=bedroom 
    
   By base64 encoding this URL (and potentially encrypting it to avoid 
   revealing information about the types of devices contained in the 
   domain) it is possible to structure this URL as part of a SIP URL; 
    
     sip:a458fauzu3k3z@stan.home.net 
    
   Thus, the existing structure of <entity>@<location> is maintained 
   even when extended to accommodate appliances. However, it is not 
   mandatory to use this proposed type of addressing scheme ù a 
   standard SIP URL addressing scheme in either plaintext (e.g., 
   toaster@stan.home.net) or with the portion to the left of the @ sign 
   encrypted (e.g., a3245dsfs234@stan.home.net) are also valid 
   addresses that will work. A structured addressing scheme could even 
   be used in standard SIP addressing, e.g., 
   lamp.bedroom@stan.home.net. 

2.1.2   New excitation Method 
   SIP was initially created with call set-up in mind. It is intended 
   for establishing a relationship, or session, between two endpoints 
   S. Moyer et al.        Expires December 2001               [Page 7] 

   Internet Draft          SIP Appliances              June 2001 

   such that ongoing bearer paths can be established between them. This 
   structure could be generalized to cater for æshort-livedÆ 
   connections if the connection establishment phase were removed and 
   the payload generalized. The difference between the current way in 
   which SIP is used and the proposed modifications is analogous in 
   many ways to the difference between TCP and UDP or other 
   Session/Datagram protocols. 
    
   A new method is defined as part of the initiative to use SIP for 
   Networked Appliances This method, called DO, meets the requirements 
   identified above and can carry payloads other than SDP. Any MIME 
   type could be used as the payload of a SIP command and new MIME 
   types could easily be defined for Action Languages for particular 
   classes of appliances. DO  would carry the command that is 
   appropriate for the target appliance, such as Turn The Light On. The 
   command would trigger a single response, indicative of its result, 
   which would be carried by the standard SIP response mechanisms. 

2.1.3   New Payload Type(s) 
   The typical MIME payload for SIP INVITE messages is SDP (Session 
   Description Protocol). For networked appliances, a payload type that 
   is specific for communicating with devices is required. We therefore 
   propose a new MIME type called Device Messaging Protocol (DMP). The 
   exact details of the DMP are still under investigation, but we 
   believe it will be an XML-based specification that may be similar to 
   Universal Plug 'n Play's Device Control Protocol [3]. 
    
   In addition, when a device registers with a Proxy (via the REGISTER 
   message) a description of that device needs to be conveyed. We 
   propose to use a Device Description Protocol (DDP) to carry this 
   information. Like the DMP, the exact details are still under 
   development, but it also will likely be XML-based and will leverage 
   existing work in this area. 

2.1.4   Notification/Events 
   In addition to synchronous communication with networked appliances, 
   a need also exists for asynchronous communications. For example, to 
   be notified when an alarm goes off in your home, a certain

   The SIP Event Notification draft defines two new primitives, 
   SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY that can be used to achieve asynchronous 
   communications. When these two methods are used in conjunction with 
   the proposed addressing scheme (specified in section 2.1.1) and the 
   Device Messaging Protocol MIME type, then event notification from 
   and between networked appliances is enabled.

3  Example Network Architectures 
   The architectures outlined in this section provide two different 
   examples of how to support remote communication with networked 
   devices. Note that actual implementations may use any combination of 
   the two architectures described hereafter or something completely 
   different.  In the first, the client application is able to directly 
   connect to and interact with the Home Domain.  The second is when 
   the client application must interact with a proxy located in the 
   homeÆs gateway device in order to communicate with networked devices 
   in the home. Both of these architectures are now described.

   The simplest architecture of the three examples allows a client 
   application to directly connect to and interact with networked 
   devices in the home domain.  The wide area network is used to carry 
   messages from a Client application to the Home Firewall/NAT.  Once

   authenticated, they are allowed through the firewall.  Inside the 
   home domain messages are transported over the Home LAN(s) to the 
   appropriate Networked Device.  Devices may either be æIP capableÆ 
   (they can process the incoming messages themselves), or Non-IP-
   capable appliances.  Non-IP-capable appliances require Appliance 
   controllers to map IP control requests to the specific protocol and 
   physical system that the Appliance can understand.  This example is 
   illustrated in Figure 2.

   In many cases, it will not be possible or desirable to allow client 
   applications to directly access and control a userÆs Networked 
   Appliances.  This situation can occur for a number of reasons 
   including: 
    
  -  The ApplianceÆs IP address cannot be determined because it is 
     behind a NAT. 
  -  The Appliance does not have an IP address. 
  -  It is desired to keep visibility of in-home devices to a minimum. 
  -  The Home Firewall/NAT filters and rejects communications from 
     unknown sources for security reasons. 
  -  Finer-grained security is desired (i.e. authentication and access 
     control on a per device/message basis) 
    
   In this case, control messages from Client Applications must first 
   be sent to a ætrustedÆ Proxy, which has visibility into the home.  
   This architecture is illustrated in Figure 3. All communications 
   between the Proxy and the Home Firewall/NAT are assumed to be 
   secure.  In this case the Proxy is located in the home domainÆs 
   gateway device.  The proxy can provide a number of functions 
   including: 
    
  -  Authenticate and authorize each message/request. 
  -  Address mapping/resolution for NAs within the home domain. 
  -  Act as secure proxy to Home Firewall/NAT (RGW) for communications 
     to the outside world. 
  -  Provide NA mobility and tracking service. 
  -  Provide message protocol mapping service for client applications.  
     By taking this approach, a variety of client applications can be 
     supported for remote controlling NAs. 
  -  Act as charging point for services.

   This section describes an example of functional blocks that may be 
   used in the SIP Architecture for supporting networked appliances.  
   This is followed by typical ways in which these functional blocks

    Figure 4:  Example Functional Architecture for Remote Communication 
                         with Networked Appliances 
   This section outlines an example functional architecture for remote 
   controlling Networked Appliances.  The functional architecture 
   (based on the Messaging via Proxy architecture of Figures 3 and 4) 
   is illustrated in Figure 4.  The functional entities can be 
   distributed across different physical network elements (see Section 
   3) and this document only describes some of the possible 
   distributions.  The key functional entities are now described: 
    
  -  SIP UA (Originating domain):  This SIP UA is used by the 
     Originating application to generate and send Appliance messages 
     (DO) to the SIP Proxy hosted by either the Service Provider or the 
     Home RGW.

   Internet Draft          SIP Appliances              June 2001 

  -  SIP Proxy (Service Provider domain):  The SIP proxy in the Service 
     Provider domain resolves the address of the Appliance to be 
     communicated with (including appropriate Home domain RGW) by 
     lookup in a Location Database.  The SIP proxy forwards Appliance 
     messages from the Client SIP UA to the SIP Proxy in the Home 
     Domain RGW or, via a secure connection, directly to the UA in the 
     target device. 
  -  Location Database (Service Provider domain):  The Service Provider 
     Location Database contains location information for all registered 
     appliances within the home domains.  This database is populated 
     with information gathered by the Service Provider SIP Proxy and/or 
     other existing in-home service location protocols/mechanisms. 
  -  SIP Proxy (Home Domain RGW):  The SIP Proxy in the Home Domain RGW 
     provides the Gateway between Appliances in the Home Domain and 
     entities in the wide area.  Other RGW functions such as Firewall 
     and NAT will likely be co-located with the RGW SIP Proxy. 
  -  SIP UA (Appliance Controller/RGW):  This SIP UA terminates SIP 
     Appliance messages from the Originating Application SIP UA.  It 
     retrieves messaging information from the SIP message and passes 
     this information to the Interworking Unit.  This SIP UA may reside 
     in either the RGW or the Appliance Controller.  The mapping from 
     (logical) SIP UA to Appliance Controller is 1:N. 
  -  Interworking Unit (Appliance Controller):  The Interworking Unit 
     maps the Appliance message carried in the payload of the SIP 
     message onto the Appliance-specific protocol. 
  -  SIP UA (IP capable appliance):  This SIP UA resides in IP (SIP) 
     capable NAs.  It terminates SIP Appliance Control messages from 
     the Originating Application SIP UA, and retrieves the Appliance 
     Control information for the Appliance application, acting on it 
     directly without any requirement for an intervening interworking 
     unit. 
  -  Non-IP Capable Appliance:  Non-IP Appliances are controlled by the 
     Appliance Controller and require Interworking Units to 
     communicate/interact with the Client Applications. 
    
   The key interfaces in Figure 4 are: 
  -  SIP[Appliances]:  This interface represents IETF SIP [11] with the 
     DO method for communicating with Networked Appliances. 
  -  Appliance Registration and Location:  Any appropriate database 
     update and lookup protocol may be used to access the Location 
     Databases.  Examples of such a protocols are LDAP [12] and SLP 
     [13]. 
  -  Appliance-Specific interfaces:  There are numerous home-networking 
     technologies currently available [1-6].  It is the function of the 
     Interworking Unit to map from SIP to the protocols of the specific 
     technology of the target device.

   In this diagram, the Originating SIP UA is on the PC in the user's 
   office. They originate a message from this machine to manipulate an 
   object within the home û perhaps a video camera or a light, for 
   example. This message is forwarded, using standard SIP techniques, 
   to the Service Provider who is responsible for the home, who sends 
   it on to the Set Top Box (STB) (or RGW, or Cable Modem or ADSL Modem 
   or whatever appropriate edge of home technology is deployed). The 
   STB sends the message on either directly to the SIP-capable device 
   (which will tend to be devices with higher capabilities such as 
   video recorders and home audio-video equipment, HAVi 
   notwithstanding), or indirectly via an Interworking Unit, which will 
   be part of an appliance controller. 
    
   The intention with the physical realization is to avoid the user 
   needing to be aware of the level and sophistication of the 
   communication that is being performed on their behalf. 

5  Application Scenarios 
   The following sub-sections provide examples of how SIP could be used 
   for inter-domain networking of appliances. Note, not all SIP header 
   fields (e.g. CSeq, Call-ID, and Content-length) are included in the 
   following examples. For the sake of brevity, only the header fields 
   of particular interest have been included. Also note that DMP has 
   not yet been standardized and the DMP examples should be considered 
   to be for illustration only.  
    
   We do not comment on the practical validity of any given scenario. 

5.1 Simple Access to Home from Work 
   In this scenario, the user wishes to turn on a lamp within their 
   home from their office PC.

                 Figure 6. Simple Access to Home from Work 
   The SIP messages for the remote control (e.g., from the office) of a 
   NA within the home (e.g., a lamp) are shown below.  Please note that 
   the SLP URL information will be encoded and optionally encrypted for 
   privacy, but is shown un-encrypted between [ and ] for clarity in 
   the examples in this section. In the following example we assume 
   that the UA in stan.home.net has registered with stan.home.net and 
   that that information has also propagated to home.net. 
    
  1. DO sip:[d=lamp,r=bedroom,u=stanm]@home.net SIP/2.0 
     From: sip:stan@co.com 
     To: sip:[d=lamp,r=bedroom,u=stanm]@home.net

     Content-function: render 
     Content-type: application/dmp 
     <command><turn>On</turn></command> 
    
     The co.com Proxy does an SRV look-up in DNS [15] for 
     [d=lamp,r=bedroom,u=stanm]@home.net to find the name of the SIP 
     server for the destination domain and gets a value of home.net. 
     This implies that the user/service name must be unique within the 
     service providerÆs domain when an SRV record points to a service 
     providerÆs Proxy. 
    
  2. DO sip:[d=lamp,r=bedroom,u=stanm]@home.net SIP/2.0 
     From: sip:stan@co.com

  5. <Action!!!> 
    
   The above scenario could also be used to depict a failure scenario. 
   Once the lamp receives the message, it may realize that its bulb is 
   "blown" (broken) and in response, send something like:

5.2 Access with Re-direction 
   In this case, the lamp from stan.home.net has temporarily been moved 
   to simon.home.net.  To accommodate the change, a re-direction is 
   added into the home.net proxy. The SIP Messages for this scenario 
   are shown below. In this example, we assume that the lamp from 
   stan.home.net has been unregistered with both stan.home.net and 
   home.net and that the UA in simon.home.net has performed the 
   appropriate registrations.

   The home.net proxy does a look-up and notices that Stan's bedroom 
   lamp is now in Simon's spare room.  Therefore, the Request-URI now

     (this message is forwarded to request originator on anypc.co.com) 
    
   The main differences between this example and the example in section 
   5.1 are: 
    
  -  a different body to issue a query for the temperature instead of a 
     command to turn on the light 
  -  the removal of the Content-function header field since ôrenderö is 
     the default value for this header field in a DO method (this is 
     optional and it could have been left in). 
    
   After Stan receives the temperature, he could issue another command 
   to set the desired temperature. This would use a similar DO with a 
   different body content. 

5.4 Answering the Front Doorbell from the Car 
   Stan is riding with Dave in DaveÆs car and remembers that he was 
   expecting a service person to come and fix the dishwasher and he 
   does not have his Web phone. He asks to borrow DaveÆs phone and 
   sends a message to his service provider to notify him if someone

   Internet Draft          SIP Appliances              June 2001 

   ôringsö the doorbell. When the service person ôringsö the doorbell 
   (and authenticates themselves with their ID badge), a message is 
   sent to DaveÆs Web phone for Stan indicating that the service person 
   is at the front door. After verifying that it is indeed a person 
   from the right company, Stan issues a command to unlock the front 
   door and let the person in. For this scenario, the following 
   assumptions are made: 
  -  Device Controller UA is configured to send outbound message to 
     Proxy at stan.home.net 
  -  Dave's UA is configured to send outbound message to Proxy at 
     mobile.net

   weather, road, and traffic conditions. If the network-based alarm 
   clock service provider adjusts your wake-up time, you would want to 
   know why. So, then it would be convenient for the alarm clock 
   service provider to establish an audio session with your alarm clock 
   and "play" a message containing the reason(s) for the adjusted wake-
   up time (and maybe include the current weather, top news stories, 
   etc.). The message flow for this scenario (depicted in Figure 10) 
   would be as follows:

5.6  Querying the capabilities of a Networked Appliance 
   Wally's VCR broke down a few days ago. Today is Saturday and Wally 
   wants to record the Simpson's cartoon show. He walks up to his 
   office colleague, Dilbert who gives him permission to use his VCR to 
   record the show. Wally knows Dilbert's VCR is a Sony Model, but does 
   not know if it supports pre-programmed pause and resume for 
   recording (to avoid commercial advertisements). Wally queries the 
   VCR at Dilbert's Home to determine its capability set. Wally 
   receives a response from the VCR telling him which video package 
   this particular VCR supports as well as more detailed information in 
   the body about the VCR.

5.7 Forking for Services 
   Calvin wants to print a document in his office. There are three 
   printers in different floors that are capable of printing his 
   document. Calvin contacts the default proxy server, which forks this 
   request to the different printers. The available printer responds 
   and Calvin CANCELS the other pending requests. For the sake of this 
   example, let us suppose Calvin wants to establish a session with an 
   available printer in which he will send the data once a confirmation 
   is received.

5.8 Device Grouping and personal Identification 
   SIP can also allow personal and group device identification. For 
   example, using SIP, an air conditioner in Hagar's home domain could 
   be addressed by the nickname of ôcoolboyö and at the same time also 
   be known as a category of ôair conditionerö. This serves a two-fold 
   purpose ù it allows owners to allocate personalities to their 
   devices as well as, if needed, address a group irrespective of their 
   nicknames. 
    
   For example, to set the temperature of  ôcoolboyö to 25 degrees C , 
   Hagar can send  
    
1. DO sip:[d=coolboy,r=room,u=hagar]@hagar.home.net SIP/2.0 
  From: sip:hagar@vacation.com 
  To: sip:[d=coolboy,r=room,u=hagar]@hagar.home.net 
  Via: SIP/2.0/UDP vacation.com 
  Content-type: application/dmp  
  <command> 
          Temperature 
          <set> 25C </set> 
        </command> 
    
   At the same time, if Hagar wanted to switch off all air conditioners 
   in his house, he could multicast or broadcast the command.

   Internet Draft          SIP Appliances              June 2001 

2. DO sip:[group=airconditioner, u=hagar]@hagar.home.net SIP/2.0 
  From: sip:hagar@vacation.com 
  To: sip:[group=airconditioner, u=hagar]@hagar.home.net 
  Via: SIP/2.0/UDP vacation.com 
   Content-type: application/dmp  
  <command> 
  Off 
   </command> 
    
   All network aware devices are configured to be a part of a group. 
   For example, various air conditioner vendors may have their own 
   schemes of private naming, but they all know they belong to the ôac-
   groupö of devices. So when such a message arrives, they know they 
   are a part of it. Alternately, it is possible that a central Proxy 
   or Appliance Controller is configured by the user or vendor of 
   device groups in his house and once such a message arrives at the 
   Proxy/Controller, it sends an appropriate DO command to each device 
   in this group. 

6  Security Considerations 
   Security is a primary concern, especially since this system is 
   intended for deployment in individual userÆs homes. We briefly 
   outline here the security threats that are applicable to the 
   protocol described herein, and which must be considered in any 
   implementation of this protocol. We also discuss some possible 
   approaches to deal with the security issues raised.  
    
   We point out that there are security concerns raised by this 
   document, which are, however, outside the scope of the present 
   discussion. In this discussion, we only consider security of the 
   underlying SIP protocol (as it relates to networked appliances). We 
   also assume (physical) security of the userÆs home; in other words, 
   our analysis assumes that only on the Internet can an adversary 
   eavesdrop on SIP messages, forge SIP messages, and modify SIP 
   messages.  

6.1 Security Threats 

6.1.1   Importance of Security 
   Security concerns must be paramount when designing a system, which 
   allows remote access to a home. A forged (generic) SIP message will 
   usually be no more than an annoyance, but a forged command to turn 
   on an appliance within someone else's home is a potential disaster. 
   Therefore, methods for verifying authenticity MUST be provided in 
   any system that allows remote home access. In particular, all (SIP) 
   communication to the home MUST be authenticated by the home 
   RGW/firewall, and verified to have originated from either an 
   authorized individual (in the case of direct communication from user 
   S. Moyer et al.        Expires December 2001               [Page 30] 

   Internet Draft          SIP Appliances              June 2001 

   to the home, as in Figure 3) or an authorized Service Provider Proxy 
   (in the case of communication via proxy, as in Figure 4). In the 
   second case, the Service Provider Proxy also MUST have verified that 
   communication originated from an individual authorized to 
   communicate with the home.  
    
   Privacy will be a concern for many users, particularly since 
   messages contain information about the existence and use of 
   appliances within their home. Thus, implementations MUST provide 
   methods for private (i.e., encrypted) communication. However, users 
   may choose to opt out (but they MUST NOT be allowed to opt out of 
   checking proper authentication, as detailed above).  
    
   Security of message responses is important as well. These responses 
   may eventually contain status information (i.e., the current 
   temperature of the house, and faked 100 and 200 response messages 
   can also cause problems. 

6.1.2   Privacy 
   In general, a user will not want a passive eavesdropper to be able 
   to determine the content of a message. This applies not only to the 
   body of the message (which will contain the command to be executed), 
   but also to header fields that may leak information about the 
   devices one owns. For example, the To: header field will contain a 
   URL of the addressed entity which, as proposed in Section 2.1.1, 
   will indicate the device type and location. A user may not want 
   anyone to know whether he owns a television, and he certainly will 
   not want anyone to know the room in which the television is located.  
    
   If the underlying architecture being implemented provides direct 
   control of the home domain, no intermediate proxies need be trusted 
   (with respect to privacy) because appropriate fields can be suitably 
   encrypted. However, if the underlying architecture is communication 
   via Proxy (e.g., deployed in the service provider's network), an 
   assumption of trust of the intervening Proxy is inevitable.  
    
   REGISTER messages may also require encryption, if registration takes 
   place in a network outside the home (as it would in the case of 
   communication via Proxy).  

6.1.3   Authentication 
   From the userÆs point of view, an even more important concern is 
   proper authentication of SIP messages. Note that messages in either 
   direction (from user to home or from home to user) require 
   authentication. The authentication requirement on messages from user 
   to home is obvious, since these are messages, which will effect 
   certain actions inside the home. However, 100 and 200 response 
   messages from the home to the user must also be authenticated, lest 
   S. Moyer et al.        Expires December 2001               [Page 31] 

   Internet Draft          SIP Appliances              June 2001 

   an adversary insert a fake Acknowledge or Confirmed message when in 
   fact the original message was never received. Also, responses may 
   eventually include status information, such as the temperature of 
   the house or whether the alarm system is turned on. 
    
   In addition to authentication of DO messages, REGISTER messages may 
   also potentially require authentication. However, if registration is 
   done with the home RGW (as would be the case when direct 
   communication (Figure 3) is assumed), cryptographic solutions are 
   not necessary (due to the physical security of the home network). 
   When registration takes place in an outside network (as when 
   Communication via Proxy is used), these messages must be 
   authenticated.  
    
   Authentication of messages will prevent fabrication, modification, 
   and masquerading. An issue not directly resolved by authentication 
   is replay attacks. Replay attacks can be defended against in two 
   ways. One simple way to do this is to check for repeated messages; 
   this can be done, for example, by checking the Timestamp: or CSeq: 
   fields against previously stored messages. However, there is a limit 
   to the number of previously used Timestamps can be stored, and this 
   leaves open the possibility of replaying a (very) old message. A 
   more robust solution is to check for old messages by comparing the 
   Timestamp: field to the current system time. Note that the 
   Timestamp: field cannot be maliciously modified because of the 
   assumed message authentication being used. In this case, however, 
   some synchronization of clocks is assumed 

6.2 Solutions 
   Methods for achieving privacy and authentication for (generic) SIP 
   messages appear in [11] and, in general, these methods apply to the 
   case of addressing NAs as well. However, we highlight a few 
   important differences between general SIP security and the specific 
   case of remote home access. 

6.2.1   Security Using a Shared Secret 
   For general SIP security, some form of public-key technology must be 
   employed to provide security [11]. In the case of remote access to 
   NAs within the home, however, shared secrets can be used to provide 
   privacy and authentication. The are two primary reasons for this 
   difference: first, general SIP communication can potentially occur 
   between any two parties, while in the case of remote access to the 
   home a one-to-one (or few-to-one) correspondence exists between 
   authorized users and the homes to which they will be communicating. 
   Second, general SIP communication frequently occurs between parties 
   who have had no prior contact, and therefore no opportunity to 
   generate a shared secret. In the case of home access, however, users 
   will have the opportunity to designate a shared secret for use in

   their communication with the home. The secret may be shared either 
   with the home RGW/firewall (in the case of direct communication from 
   user to the home, as in Figure 1) or with the Service Provider Proxy 
   (in the case of Communication via Proxy, as in Figure 4). 
     
   In general, secret-key methods are preferable to public-key methods 
   due to both their higher level of security and increased efficiency.  
    
   Note that in some cases, public-key methods may be preferable. It 
   may be advantageous to provide implementations for both. 
   Implementation details will depend on outside factors including the 
   requirements of the service provider, initial installation, billing, 
   record keeping, supported remote access methods, and future 
   upgradability. 

6.2.2   End-to-End Encryption 
   The SIP RFC [11] describes two methods of achieving privacy: encrypt 
   end-to-end or hop-by-hop. In the particular setting of remote access 
   to the home, we recommend that only end-to-end encryption be used. 
   End-to-end encryption is certainly more efficient, and if the user 
   and the home RGW/firewall (or Service Provider Proxy) share a secret 
   key, there is no need to rely on hop-by-hop encryption. Furthermore, 
   hop-by-hop encryption requires trust in every proxy along the 
   message path, while end-to-end encryption only requires trust in the 
   final UA that performs the decryption (either the home RGW/firewall 
   or the Service Provider Proxy). 
    
   We distinguish two cases. First, as in Figure 3, we may have direct 
   communication from the user to the home where decryption and 
   verification of authenticity are done by the home RGW/firewall. In 
   this case, the original message from the user can be encrypted and 
   authenticated using the secret key shared by the user and the home. 
   In the second case, communication is via Proxy outside of the home 
   domain (e.g., a service provider deployed Proxy). In this scenario, 
   the message from the user is first encrypted and authenticated using 
   a key shared between the user and the service provider's Proxy. Upon 
   receipt of the message, the service provider's Proxy verifies the 
   authenticity of the message and decrypts. Then, the message is 
   authenticated and encrypted using a key shared between the service 
   provider's Proxy and the home and forwarded to the home (note that 
   this step may also be handled by the establishment of a secure IPSec 
   tunnel between the service provider's Proxy and the home). The 
   forwarded message is authenticated (as having come from the service 
   provider's Proxy) and decrypted by the home RGW/firewall before 
   being allowed inside the home. (Although technically this is no 
   longer end-to-end encryption, we prefer to think of it that way 
   since there will be many intermediate proxies along the path from

   user to the service provider's Proxy, and the message is not re-
   encrypted for each hop.) 

6.2.3   Encryption of the To: field 
   One major difference between this document and [11] is that the To: 
   header field now contains potentially sensitive information (such as 
   device names and locations) which should be encrypted. The body of 
   the message (and appropriate header fields) should be encrypted as 
   detailed in [11] (although possibly using private-key technology). 
   Encryption of the To: field should take place separately from 
   encryption of the body of the message. Since the entire contents of 
   the To: field cannot be encrypted (this information is used for 
   routing), only the portion to the left of the ô@ö (the entity 
   information) should be encrypted. 
    
   At first glance, this might appear problematic since routing is done 
   based on entity information contained in the To: field. We show that 
   this problem is easily avoided. Indeed, routing is done based on two 
   components of the To: field: the entity name (appearing to the left 
   of the ô@ö) and the location (appearing to the right of the ô@ö). 
   Information about the location component (typically domain-names) is 
   available to every proxy in the network. On the other hand, 
   information about specific entities is (typically) only available to 
   a select few proxies (in particular, the home RGW/firewall when 
   assuming direct communication from user to the home, or the Service 
   Provider Proxy when assuming communication via proxy). Thus, for 
   most proxies, routing will be based solely on the location component 
   of the To: field, and they therefore have no need to examine the 
   entity component. On the other hand, proxies that do need to see the 
   contents of the entity component will have the decryption key 
   available to them (since the encryption was done with the 
   appropriate shared key). Thus, routing will proceed via the location 
   component until the message reaches a proxy that has access to 
   information concerning specific devices within that domain. This 
   proxy, by construction, will also have access to the correct key for 
   decrypting (and authenticating) the message. Upon decrypting the 
   message, and in particular the entity component of the To: field, 
   the proxy can correctly route the message using this additional 
   information.  

7  Conclusion 
   We have shown how SIP, with the newly proposed DO, SUBSCRIBE, and 
   NOTIFY messages, plus the new MIME types, and new mechanism for 
   encoding service information in the To: field can provide the 
   support necessary for communication with networked appliances from 
   the wide area. This proposal enables leveraging the existing SIP 
   infrastructure and capabilities (e.g., hop-by-hop routing and 
   security) for a new problem domain ù networked appliances.
