1.  Introduction

   OAuth 2.0 Proof-of-Possession (PoP) Security Architecture [POPA]
   identifies Sender Constraint and Key Confirmation as possible threat
   mitigation methods against the use of token by an unauthorized
   presenter.  While Proof-Of-Possession Semantics for JSON Web Tokens
   (JWTs) [POPS] touches briefly on the Sender Constraint, it is only
   one paragraph within a introductory text and does not discuss it in
   detail.  Instead, it devotes much of the discussion to the Key
   Confirmation method.  It also is making the usage of such token
   against the resource server out of scope.

   This discussion draft describes a way to express the Sender
   Constraint in the JWT, as well as one possible way of using it to
   access a protected resource.

   The initial draft of this document was created in response to the
   WGLC of the Proof-Of-Possession Semantics for JSON Web Tokens(JWTs)
   [POPS].

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

   Unless otherwise noted, all the protocol parameter names and values
   are case sensitive.

2.  Terms and definitions

   For the purpose of this document, the terms defined in RFC6749
   [RFC6749] is used.  In addition, following term is defined.

   Authorized Presenter  Party that the token is intended to be used by.

3.  Justification

   There are scenarios that the bearer token may be stolen, modified,
   reused or replayed.  To prevent these threats, resource servers need
   to obtain additional assurance that the client is indeed authorized
   to present an access token.  The detailed use cases can be found in
   OAuth 2.0 Proof-of-Possession (PoP) Security Architecture [POPA]
   specification that sites token reuse by the resource server and
   eavesdropping of the resource request among others.  Some additional
   use-cases such as token leaking from the client's database or
   authorization server's database is also conceivable.

   As described in OAuth 2.0 Proof-of-Possession (PoP) Security
   Architecture [POPA] specification, there are several ways to prevent
   these bearer token threats: Confidentiality Protection, Sender
   Constraint and Key Confirmation.  Key Confirmation mechanism is
   described in OAuth 2.0 Proof-Of-Possession Semantics for JSON Web
   Tokens (JWTs) [POPS] specification in detail, but Sender Constraint
   mechanism is not explained in detail.

   Sender confirmation mechanism has some advantage in some cases over
   the general key confirmation mechanism explained in [POPS] in cases
   such as:

   (1)  The client's public key is published in a known way in the
        ecosystem, e.g., in .well-known/jwks and the private key is
        stored in a HSM.

   (2)  The resource server wishes to have some non-repudiation of the
        client.

Internet-Draft                    scjwt                        July 2015


   These can be achieved with relative ease with sender confirmation.

   Key Confirmation mechanism is more general in nature.  It is
   applicable even in the case where client's privacy is sought or the
   client is a public client using OAuth PKCE [PKCE].  As the downside
   of it, it requires a complete key distribution protocol and can
   become more complicated.  Sender Confirmation mechanism should also
   be specified, and it can work as an alternative mechanism to mitigate
   the bearer token threats.

4.  Sender Constraint Representation

   Sender Constraint is expressed by including the following member at
   the top level of JWT payload.

   azp  The Client ID of the Authorized Presenter.

   Following is an example of such JWT payload.

        {
         "iss": "https://server.example.com",
         "sub": "joe@example.com",
         "azp": "https://client.example.org",
         "aud": "https://resource.example.org",
         "exp": "1361398824",
         "nbf": "1360189224",
        }


   Figure 1 Example of Sender Constrained JWT.

5.  Client Authentication

   The resource server that supports this specification MUST
   authenticate the Client.  In this document a possible method is
   proposed as follows:

   1.  The authorized presenter issues a HEAD or GET request to the
   resource server.

   GET /resource/1234 HTTP/1.0
   Host: server.example.com

   2.  The resource server returns a HTTP 401 response with "WWW-
   Authenticate" header with "Named" scheme, which includes nonce.

Internet-Draft                    scjwt                        July 2015


   HTTP/1.0 401 Unauthorized
   Server: HTTPd/0.9
   Date: Wed, 14 March 2015 09:26:53 GMT
   WWW-Authenticate: Named nonce="dcd98b7102dd2f0e8b11d0f600bfb0c093"

   3.  The client creates JWS compact serialization over the nonce.

   4.  The client sends the request to the resource server, this time
   with Authorization: header with Named scheme and access token and the
   JWS.

   GET /resource/1234 HTTP/1.0
   Host: server.example.com
   Authorization: Named at="access.token.jwt", s="jws.of.nonce"

   5.  The resource server finds the client key corresponding to the
   value of "azp" in the access token.  It may have been obtained
   through client registration at the Issuer or thourhg .well-known/jwk
   etc.

   6.  The resource server creates the JWS of the nonce and compares it
   with the value of "s" of the Authorization header.  If it fails, the
   process stops here and the resource access MUST be denied.

   7.  The resource server MUST verify the access token.  If it is
   valid, the resource SHOULD be returned as HTTP response.

6.  Finding the client key

   When the resource server authenticates the client, it has to find out
   the keys that corresponds to the signing key of the client.  There
   are several possible ways to do this.

6.1.  URI client ID

   When the Client ID is a URI, then the key can be found from the
   .well-know/jwk URI.

6.2.  pre-shared key tables

   Alternatively, the collection of the keys can be pre-shared among the
   participants in advance as a key table that lists the client ID -
   public key pair.

6.3.  Via client metadata API of the authorization server

   Client Metadata can be exposed through a client metadata API at the
   Authorization Server, which can be defined by the authorization
   server in a way similar to OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection [TINTRO].

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Named Authentication Scheme

   A new scheme has been registered in the HTTP Authentication Scheme
   Registry as follows:

   Authentication Scheme Name: Named

   Reference: Section 5 of this specification

   Notes (optional): The Named Authentication scheme is intended to be
   used only with OAuth Resource Access, and thus does not support proxy
   authentication.

8.  Security Considerations

   Needless to say, the client's secret key must be kept securely.

9.  Acknowledgements
