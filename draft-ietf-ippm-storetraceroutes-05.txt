Abstract

   This document describes a standard way to store the configuration and
   the results of traceroute measurements.  This document first of all
   describes the tool itself; afterwards, the common information model
   is defined dividing the information elements in two semantically
   separated groups (configuration elements and results ones).  Moreover

   an additional element is defined to relate configuration elements and
   results ones by means of a common unique identifier.  On the basis of
   the information model a data model based on XML is defined to store
   the results of traceroute measurements.

1.  Introduction

   Traceroutes are being used by lots of measurement efforts, either as
   an independent measurement or to get path information to support
   other measurement efforts.  That is why there is the need to
   standardize the way the configuration and the results of traceroute
   measurements are stored.  The standard metrics defined by IPPM
   working group in matter of delay, connectivity and losses do not
   apply to the metrics returned by the traceroute tool; therefore, in
   order to compare results of traceroute measurements, the only
   possibility is to add to the stored results a specification of the
   operating system and version for the traceroute tool used.  This
   document, in order to store results of traceroute measurements and
   allow comparison of them, defines a standard way to store them using
   a XML schema.  The document is organized as follows: Section 2
   defines the terminology used in this document, Section 3 describes
   the traceroute tool, Section 4 describes the results of a traceroute
   measurement as displayed to the screen from which the traceroute tool
   was launched.  Section 5 and Section 6 respectively describe the
   information model and data model for storing configuration and
   results of the traceroute measurements.  The document ends with
   security considerations and IANA considerations in Section 8 and
   Section 9 respectively.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


2.  Terminology used in this document

   The terminology used in this document is defined as follow:
   o  traceroute tool: a software tool for network diagnostic behaving
      like described in Section 3;
   o  traceroute measurement: an instance of the traceroute tool
      launched, with specific configuration parameters (traceroute
      measurement configuration parameters), from a specific host
      (initiator of the traceroute measurement) giving as output
      specific traceroute measurement results;
   o  traceroute probe: one of many IP packets send out by the
      traceroute tool during a traceroute measurement;
   o  traceroute measurement configuration parameters: the configuration
      parameters of a traceroute measurement;
   o  traceroute measurement results: the results of a traceroute
      measurement;
   o  traceroute measurement information: both the results and the
      configuration parameters of a traceroute measurement;

   o  traceroute measurement path: a sequence of hosts transited in
      order by traceroute probes during a traceroute measurement;


3.  The Traceroute tool and its operations

   Traceroute is a network diagnostic tool used to determine the hop by
   hop path from a source to a destination and the Round Trip Time (RTT)
   from the source to each hop.  Traceroute can be therefore used to
   discover some information (hop counts, delays, etc.) about the path
   between the initiator of the traceroute measurement and other hosts.

   Typically, the traceroute tool attempts to discover the path to a
   destination by sending UDP probes with specific time-to-live (TTL)
   values in the IP packet header and trying to elicit an ICMP
   TIME_EXCEEDED response from each gateway along the path to some host.

   More in detail, a first set of probes with TTL equal to 1 are sent by
   the traceroute tool from the host initiating the traceroute
   measurement (some tool implementations allow setting the initial TTL
   to a value equal to "n" different from 1, so that the first "n-1"
   hops are skipped and the first hop that will be traced is the "n-th"
   in the path).  Upon receiving a probe, the first hop host decreases
   the TTL value by one.  By observing a TTL value equal to zero, the
   host rejects the probe and typically returns an ICMP message with a
   TIME_EXCEEDED value.  The traceroute tool can therefore derive the IP
   address of the first hop from the header of the ICMP message and
   evaluate the RTT between the host initiating the traceroute
   measurement and the first hop.  The next hops are discovered
   following the same procedure, taking care of increasing at each step
   the TTL value of the probes by one.  The TTL value is increased until
   either an ICMP PORT_UNREACHABLE message is received, meaning that the
   destination host has been reached, or the maximum configured number
   of hops has been hit.

   Some implementations, use ICMP Echos, instead of UDP datagrams.
   However, many routers do not return ICMP messages about ICMP
   messages, i.e. no ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED is returned for an ICMP Echo.
   Therefore, this document recommends to base implementations on UDP
   datagrams.  Considerations on TCP-based implementations of the
   traceroute tool are reported in Appendix A.1.


4.  Results of traceroute measurements

   The following list reports the information fields provided as results
   by all traceroute tool implementations considered.  The order in
   which they are reported here is not relevant and it changes in



Niccolini, et al.        Expires March 29, 2008                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft          Traceroute Storage Format         September 2007


   different implementations.  For each hop the information reported is:
   o  the hop index;
   o  the host symbolic address, provided that at least one of the
      probes received a response, the symbolic address could be resolved
      at the corresponding host and that the option to display only
      numerical addresses was not set;
   o  the host IP address, provided that at least one of the probes
      received a response;
   o  the RTT for each response to a probe.
   Depending on the traceroute tool implementation, additional
   information might be displayed in the output (for instance MPLS-
   related information).

   It might happen that some probes do not receive a response within the
   configured time-out (for instance if the probe is filtered out by a
   firewall).  In this case, an "*" is displayed in place of the RTT.
   The information model reflects this using a string with the value of
   "RoundTripTimeNotAvailable" meaning either the probe was lost because
   of a time-out or it was not possible to transmit a probe.  It may
   also happen that some implementations print the same line multiple
   times when a router decreases the TTL by more than one looking like
   multiple hops, the information model is not impacted by this since
   each line is handled separately and it is left to the applications
   handling the XML file how to deal with it.  Moreover, for delays
   below 1 ms, some implementations reports 0 ms (e.g.  UNIX and LINUX)
   while WINDOWS tracert reports "< 1 ms".


5.  Information Model for Traceroute Measurements

   The information model is composed of information elements; for
   defining these information elements, a template is used.  Such
   template is specified in the list below:

   o  name - A unique and meaningful name for the information element.
      The preferred spelling for the name is to use mixed case if the
      name is compound, with an initial lower case letter, e.g.,
      "sourceIpAddress".
   o  description - The semantics of this information element.
   o  dataType - One of the types listed in Section 5.1 of this document
      or in an extension of the information model.  The type space for
      attributes is constrained to facilitate implementation.
   o  units - If the element is a measure of some kind, the units
      identify what the measure is.
   o  default value - The default value for the element (where
      applicable).

5.1.  Data Types

   This section describes the set of valid data types of the information
   model.

   o  String - The type "String" represents a finite length string of
      valid characters from the Unicode character encoding set.  Unicode
      allows for ASCII and many other international character sets to be
      used.  It is expected that strings will be encoded in UTF-8
      format, which is identical in encoding for USASCII characters, but
      also accommodates other Unicode multi-byte characters.
   o  InetAddressType - The type "InetAddressType" represents a type of
      Internet address.  The allowed values are to be intended as
      imported from [RFC4001]; an additional allowed value is
      "asnumber".
   o  InetAddress - The type "InetAddress" denotes a generic Internet
      address.  The allowed values are to be intended as imported from
      [RFC4001]; an additional allowed value is the AS number to be
      indicated as the actual number plus the indication how the mapping
      from IP address to AS number was performed.
   o  TruthValue - The type "TruthValue" represents a Boolean value.
      The allowed values are to be intended as imported from [RFC2579].
   o  Unsigned32 - The type "Unsigned32" represents a value in the range
      (0..4294967295).
   o  Unsigned16 - The type "Unsigned16" represents a value in the range
      (0..65535).
   o  Unsigned8 - The type "Unsigned32" represents a value in the range
      (0..255).
   o  InterfaceIndexOrZero - The type "InterfaceIndexOrZero" is an
      extension of the InterfaceIndex convention.  The latter defines a
      greater than zero value used to identify an interface or interface
      sub-layer in the system.  This extension permits the additional
      value of zero.  Examples of the usage of zero might include
      situations where interface was unknown, or when none or all
      interfaces need to be referenced.  The allowed values are to be
      intended as imported from [RFC2863].
   o  ProbesType - The type "ProbesType" represents a way of indicating
      the protocol used for the traceroute probes.  Allowed values are
      UDP, TCP, ICMP.
   o  DateAndTime - The type "DateAndTime" represents a date-time
      specification.  The allowed values are to be intended as imported
      from [RFC2579] apart from the fact that in this document there is
      the need to use a millisecond resolution instead a decisecond one.
   o  OperationResponseStatus - The type "OperationResponseStatus" is
      used to report the result of an operation.  The allowed values are
      to be intended as imported from [RFC4560].

5.2.  Information Elements

   This section describes the elements related to the storing of a
   traceroute measurement.  The elements are grouped in two groups
   (Configuration and Results) according to their semantics.  In order
   to relate configuration and results elements by means of a common
   unique identifier, an additional element is defined belonging to both
   the two groups.

5.2.1.  Configuration Information Elements

   This section describes the elements specific to the configuration of
   the traceroute measurement.

5.2.1.1.  CtlTargetAddressType

   o  name - CtlTargetAddressType
   o  description - Specifies the type of destination address used in
      the traceroute measurement.
   o  dataType - InetAddressType
   o  units - N/A
   o  default value - N/A

5.2.1.2.  CtlTargetAddress

   o  name - CtlTargetAddress
   o  description - Specifies the host address used in the traceroute
      measurement.  The host address type can be determined by the
      examining the value of the corresponding CtlTargetAddressType.
   o  dataType - InetAddress
   o  units - N/A
   o  default value - N/A

5.2.1.3.  CtlBypassRouteTable

   o  name - CtlBypassRouteTable
   o  description - Specifies if the optional bypassing of the route
      table was enabled or not.  If enabled, the normal routing tables
      will be bypassed and the probes will be sent directly to a host on
      an attached network.  If the host is not on a directly-attached
      network, an error is returned.  This option can be used to perform
      the traceroute measurement to a local host through an interface
      that has no route defined.
   o  dataType - TruthValue
   o  units - N/A
   o  default value - false

5.2.1.4.  CtlProbeDataSize

   o  name - CtlProbeDataSize
   o  description - Specifies the size of the probes of a traceroute
      measurement in octets.  If UDP datagrams are used as probes, then
      the value contained in this object is exact.  If another protocol
      is used to transmit probes (i.e.  TCP or ICMP) for which the
      specified size is not appropriate, then the implementation can use
      whatever size (appropriate to the method) is closest to the
      specified size.  The maximum value for this object was computed by
      subtracting the smallest possible IP header size of 20 octets
      (IPv4 header with no options) and the UDP header size of 8 octets
      from the maximum IP packet size.  An IP packet has a maximum size
      of 65535 octets (excluding IPv6 Jumbograms).
   o  dataType - Unsigned32
   o  units - octets
   o  default value - 0

5.2.1.5.  CtlTimeOut

   o  name - CtlTimeOut
   o  description - Specifies the time-out value, in seconds, for each
      probe of a traceroute measurement.
   o  dataType - Unsigned32
   o  units - seconds
   o  default value - 3

5.2.1.6.  CtlProbesPerHop

   o  name - CtlProbesPerHop
   o  description - Specifies the number of probes with the same time-
      to-live (TTL) value that are sent for each host.
   o  dataType - Unsigned32
   o  units - probes
   o  default value - 3

5.2.1.7.  CtlPort

   o  name - CtlPort
   o  description - Specifies the base UDP port used by the traceroute
      measurement.  A port that is not in use at the destination
      (target) host needs to be specified.  The default value for this
      object is the IANA assigned port, 33434, for the traceroute
      measurement.
   o  dataType - Unsigned32
   o  units - UDP Port

   o  default value - 33434

5.2.1.8.  CtlMaxTtl

   o  name - CtlMaxTtl
   o  description - Specifies the maximum TTL value for the traceroute
      measurement.
   o  dataType - Unsigned32
   o  units - time-to-live value
   o  default value - 30

5.2.1.9.  CtlDSField

   o  name - CtlDSField
   o  description - Specifies the value that was stored in the
      Differentiated Services (DS) field in the traceroute probe.  The
      DS Field is defined as the Type of Service (TOS) octet in a IPv4
      header or as the Traffic Class octet in a IPv6 header.  The value
      of this object must be a decimal integer in the range from 0 to
      255.  This option can be used to determine what effect an explicit
      DS field setting has on a traceroute measurement and its probes.
      Not all values are legal or meaningful.  Useful TOS octet values
      are probably '16' (low delay) and '8' (high throughput).  Further
      references can be found in [RFC2474] for the definition of the
      Differentiated Services (DS) field and to [RFC1812] Section 5.3.2
      for Type of Service (TOS).
   o  dataType - Unsigned32
   o  units - N/A
   o  default value - 0

5.2.1.10.  CtlSourceAddressType

   o  name - CtlSourceAddressType
   o  description - Specifies the type of the source address,
      CtlSourceAddress, used in the traceroute measurement.
   o  dataType - InetAddressType
   o  units - N/A
   o  default value - N/A

5.2.1.11.  CtlSourceAddress

   o  name - CtlSourceAddress
   o  description - Specifies the IP address (which has to be given as
      an IP number, not a hostname) as the source address used in
      traceroute probes.  On hosts with more than one IP address, this
      option can be used to force the source address to be something
      other than the primary IP address of the interface the probe is
      sent on.  A zero length octet string value for this object means

      that source address specification was disabled.  The address type
      (InetAddressType) that relates to this object is specified by the
      corresponding value of CtlSourceAddressType.
   o  dataType - InetAddress
   o  units - N/A
   o  default value - N/A

5.2.1.12.  CtlIfIndex

   o  name - CtlIfIndex
   o  description - Specifies the interface index used in the traceroute
      measurement for sending the traceroute probes.  A value of zero
      for this object implies that the interface was unknown.
   o  dataType - InterfaceIndexOrZero
   o  units - N/A
   o  default value - 0

5.2.1.13.  CtlMiscOptions

   o  name - CtlMiscOptions
   o  description - Specifies implementation dependent options.
   o  dataType - String
   o  units - N/A
   o  default value - N/A

5.2.1.14.  CtlMaxFailures

   o  name - CtlMaxFailures
   o  description - Specifies the maximum number of consecutive timeouts
      allowed before terminating a traceroute measurement.  A value of
      either 255 (maximum hop count/possible TTL value) or a 0 indicates
      that the function of terminating a remote traceroute measurement
      when a specific number of consecutive timeouts are detected was
      disabled.  This element is included to give full compatibility
      with [RFC4560].  No known implementation of traceroute currently
      supports it.
   o  dataType - Unsigned32
   o  units - timeouts
   o  default value - 5

5.2.1.15.  CtlDontFragment

   o  name - CtlDontFragment
   o  description - Specifies if the don't fragment flag (DF) in the IP
      header for a probe was enabled or not.  Setting the DF flag can be
      used for performing a manual PATH MTU test.

   o  units - N/A
   o  default value - false

5.2.1.16.  CtlInitialTtl

6.  Data Model for Storing Traceroute Measurements

   For storing and transmitting information according to the information
   model defined in the previous section, a data model is required that
   specifies how to encode the elements of the information model.

   There are several design choices for a data model.  It can use a
   binary or textual representation and it can be defined from scratch
   or use already existing frameworks and data models.  In general, the
   use of already existing frameworks and models should be preferred.

   Binary and textual representation both have advantages and
   disadvantages.  Textual representations are (with some limitations)
   human readable while a binary representation consumes less resources
   for storing, transmitting and parsing data.

   An already existing and closely related data model is the DISMAN-
   TRACEROUTE-MIB module [RFC4560], that specifies a BER encoding
   [RFC3417] used by the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
   [RFC3410] for transmitting traceroute measurement information
   (configuration and results).  This data model is well suited and
   supported within network management systems, but as a general format
   for storing and transmitting traceroute results it is not easily
   applicable.

   Another binary representation would be an extension of traffic flow
   information encodings as specified for the IPFIX protocol
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol], [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info].  The IPFIX protocol
   is extensible.  However, the architecture behind this protocol
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-architecture] is targeted at exporting passively

   measured flow information.  Therefore, some obstacles are expected
   when trying to use it for transmitting traceroute measurements
   information.

   For textual representations, using the eXtensible Markup Language
   (XML) [XML] is an obvious choice.  XML supports clean structuring of
   data and syntax checking of records.  With some limitations it is
   human readable.  It is supported well by a huge pool of tools and
   standards for generating, transmitting, parsing and converting it to
   other data formats.  Its disadvantages is the resource consumption
   for processing, storing, and transmitting information.  Since the
   expected data volumes related to traceroute measurements in network
   operation and maintenance is not expected to be extremely high, the
   inefficient usage of resources is not a significant disadvantage.
   Therefore, XML was chosen as basis for the traceroute measurements
   information model that is specified in this section.

   Section 7 contains the XML schema to be used as a template for
   storing and/or exchanging traceroute measurements information.  The
   schema was designed in order to use an extensible approach based on
   templates (pretty similar to how IPFIX protocol is designed) where
   the traceroute configuration elements (both the requested parameters,
   Request, and the actual parameters used, MeasurementMetadata) are
   metadata to be referenced by results information elements (data) by
   means of the TestName element (used as unique identifier).  Currently
   Open Grid Forum (OGF) is also using this approach and cross-
   requirements have been analyzed.  As a result of this analysis the
   XML schema contained in Section 7 is compatible with OGF schema since
   it was designed in a way that both limits the unnecessary redundancy
   and a simple one-to-one transformation between the two exist.

         or as the Traffic Class octet in a IPv6 header.
         The value of this object must be a decimal integer
         in the range from 0 to 255. This option can be
         used to determine what effect an explicit DS field
         setting has on a traceroute measurement and its
         probes. Not all values are legal or meaningful.
         Useful TOS octet values are probably '16' (low
         delay) and '8' (high throughput). Further references
         can be found in RFC 2474 for the definition of the
         Differentiated Services (DS) field and to RFC 1812
         Section 5.3.2 for Type of Service (TOS).

8.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations in this section discuss are grouped into
   considerations related to conducting traceroute measurements and
   considerations related to storing and transmitting traceroute
   measurements information.

   This memo does not specify an implementation of a traceroute tool.
   Neither does it specify a certain procedure for storing traceroute
   measurements information.  Still it is considered desirable to
   discuss related security issues below.

8.1.  Conducting Traceroute Measurements

   Conducting Internet measurements can raise both security and privacy
   concerns.  Traceroute measurements, in which traffic is injected into
   the network, can be abused for denial-of-service attacks disguised as
   legitimate measurement activity.




Niccolini, et al.        Expires March 29, 2008                [Page 35]

Internet-Draft          Traceroute Storage Format         September 2007


   Measurement parameters MUST be carefully selected so that the
   measurements inject trivial amounts of additional traffic into the
   networks they measure.  If they inject "too much" traffic, they can
   skew the results of the measurement, and in extreme cases cause
   congestion and denial of service.

   The measurements themselves could be harmed by routers giving
   measurement traffic a different priority than "normal" traffic, or by
   an attacker injecting artificial measurement traffic.  If routers can
   recognize measurement traffic and treat it separately, the
   measurements will not reflect actual user traffic.  If an attacker
   injects artificial traffic that is accepted as legitimate, the loss
   rate will be artificially lowered.  Therefore, the measurement
   methodologies SHOULD include appropriate techniques to reduce the
   probability measurement traffic can be distinguished from "normal"
   traffic.

   Authentication techniques, such as digital signatures, may be used
   where appropriate to guard against injected traffic attacks.

8.2.  Securing Traceroute Measurements Information

   Traceroute measurement information are not considered highly
   sensitive.  Still, they may contain sensitive information on network
   paths, routing states, use IP addresses, and roundtrip times, that
   the operator a networks may want to detect for business or security
   reasons.

   It is thus important to control access to Information acquired by
   conducting traceroute measurements, particularly when transmitting it
   over a networks but also when storing it.  It is RECOMMENDED that
   transmission of traceroute measurement information over a network
   uses appropriate protection mechanisms for preserving privacy,
   integrity and authenticity.  It is further RECOMMENDED that secure
   authentication and authorization are used for protecting stored
   traceroute measurement information.


9.  IANA Considerations

   This document uses URNs to describe an XML namespace and an XML
   schema for traceroute measurements information storing and
   transmission conforming to a registry mechanism described in
   [RFC3688].  Two URI assignments are requested.
   1.  Registration request for the IPPM traceroute measurements
       namespace

       *  Registrant Contact: IESG

Appendix A.  Traceroute Default Configuration Parameters

   This section lists traceroute measurement configuration parameters as
   well as their defaults on various platforms and illustrates how
   widely they may vary.  This document considered four major traceroute
   tool implementations and compared them based on configurable
   parameters and default values.  The LINUX (SUSE 9.1), BSD (FreeBSD
   7.0) and UNIX (SunOS 5.9) implementations are based on UDP datagrams,
   while the WINDOWS (XP SP2) one uses ICMP Echos.  The comparison is
   summarized in the following table, where an N/A in the option column,
   means that such parameter is not configurable for the specific
   implementation.  A comprehensive comparison of available
   implementations is outside the scope of this document; however,
   already by sampling a few different implementations, it can be
   observed that they can differ quite significantly in terms of
   configurable parameters and also default values.  Note that in the
   following table only those options which are available in at least
   two of the considered implementations are reported.

Internet-Draft          Traceroute Storage Format         September 2007


A.1.  Alternative Traceroute Implementations

   As stated above, the widespread use of firewalls might prevent UDP or
   ICMP based traceroutes to completely trace the path to a destination,
   since traceroute probes might end up being filtered.  In some cases,
   such limitation might be overcome by sending instead TCP packets to
   specific ports that hosts located behind the firewall are listening
   for connections on.  TCP based implementations use TCP SYN or FIN
   probes and listen for TIME_EXCEEDED messages, TCP RESET and other
   messages from firewalls and gateways on the path.  On the other hand,
   some firewalls filter out TCP SYN packets to prevent denial of
   service attacks, therefore the actual advantage of using TCP instead
   of UDP traceroute depends mainly on firewall configurations, which
   are not known in advance.  A detailed analysis of TCP-based
   traceroute tools and measurements was outside the scope of this
   document, anyway for completeness reasons the information model
   supports the storing of TCP-based traceroute measurements, too.


Appendix B.  Known Problems with Traceroute

B.1.  Compatibility between traceroute measurements results and IPPM
      metrics

   Because of implementation choices, a known inconsistency exists
   between the round-trip delay metric defined by the IPPM working group
   in RFC 2681 and the results returned by the current traceroute tool
   implementations.  Unfortunately, it is unlikely that the traceroute
   tool implementations will implement the standard definition in the
   near future.  The only possibility is therefore to compare results of
   different traceroute measurements one with each other; in order to do
   this, specifications both of the operating system (name and version)
   and of the traceroute tool version used were added to the metadata
   elements in order to help in comparing metrics between two different
   traceroute measurements results (if run using the same operating
   system and the same version of the tool).  Moreover, the traceroute
   tool has built-in configurable mechanisms like time-outs and can
   experience problems related to the crossing of firewalls; therefore
   some of the packets that traceroute sends out end up being time-out
   or filtered.  As a consequence, it might not be possible to trace the
   path to a node or there might not be a complete set of probes
   describing the RTT to reach it.


Appendix C.  Differences to DISMAN-TRACEROUTE-MIB

   For performing remote traceroute operations at managed node, the IETF
   has standardized the DISMAN-TRACEROUTE-MIB module in [RFC4560].  This



Niccolini, et al.        Expires March 29, 2008                [Page 42]

Internet-Draft          Traceroute Storage Format         September 2007


   module allows:

   o  retrieving capability information of the traceroute tool
      implementation at the managed node,
   o  configuring traceroute measurements to be performed,
   o  retrieving information about ongoing and completed traceroute
      measurements,
   o  retrieving traceroute measurement statistics.

   The traceroute storage format described in this document has
   significant overlaps with this MIB module.  Particularly, the models
   for the traceroute measurement configuration and for the result from
   completed measurements are almost identical.  But for other pats of
   the DISMAN-TRACEROUTE MIB module there is no need to model them in a
   traceroute measurements storage format.  Particularly, the capability
   information, information about ongoing measurements and measurement
   statistics are not covered by the DISMAN traceroute storage model.

   Concerning traceroute measurements and their results, there are
   structural differences between the two models caused by the different
   choices for the encoding of the specification.  For DISMAN-
   TRACEROUTE-MIB, the Structure of Management Information (SMIv2, STD
   58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578]) was used, while the IPPM traceroute
   measurements data model is encoded using XML.

   This difference in structure implies that the DISMAN-TRACEROUTE-MIB
   module contains SMI-specific information element (managed objects)
   that concern tables of managed objects (specification, entry creation
   and deletion, status retrieval) that are not required for the XML-
   encoded traceroute measurements data model.

   But for most of the remaining information elements that concern
   configuration of traceroute measurements and results of completed
   measurements, the semantics is identical between the DISMAN-
   TRACEROUTE-MIB module and the traceroute measurements data model.
   There are very few exceptions to this which are listed below.  Also
   naming of information elements is identical between both models with
   a few exceptions.  For the traceroute measurements data model, a few
   information elements have been added, some because of the different
   structure and some to provide additional information on completed
   measurements.

C.1.  Naming

   Basically, names in both models are chosen using the same naming
   conventions.

   For the traceroute measurement configuration information all names,



Niccolini, et al.        Expires March 29, 2008                [Page 43]

Internet-Draft          Traceroute Storage Format         September 2007


   such as CtlProbesPerHop, are identical in both models except for the
   traceRoute prefix that was removed to avoid unnecessary redundancy in
   the XML file and for CtlDataSize which was renamed to
   CtlProbeDataSize for clarification in the traceroute measurements
   data model.

   Results of measurements in the DISMAN-TRACEROUTE-MIB modules are
   distributed over two tables, the traceRouteResultsTable containing
   mainly information about ongoing measurements and the
   traceRouteProbeHistoryTable containing only information about
   completed measurements.  According to the SMIv2 naming conventions
   names of information elements in these tables have different prefixes
   (traceRouteResults and traceRouteProbeHistory).  Since the traceroute
   measurements data model only reports on completed measurements, this
   separation is not needed anymore and the prefix "Results" is used for
   all related information elements.

   Beyond that, there are only a few changes in element names.  The
   renaming actions include:

   o  traceRouteProbeHistoryProbeIndex to IndexPerHop,
   o  traceRouteProbeHistoryResponse to RoundTripTime,
   o  traceRouteProbeHistoryTime to ResultsEndDateAndTime,
   o  traceRouteProbeHistoryLastRC to ResultsHopRawOutputData.

C.2.  Semantics

   The semantics was changed for two information elements only.

   For traceRouteProbeHistoryResponse in the DISMAN-TRACEROUTE-MIB, a
   value of 0 indicated, that it was not possible to transmit a probe.
   For the traceroute measurements data model, a value of 0 for element
   RoundTripTime indicates that the measured time was less than one
   millisecond, while for the case that it was not possible to transmit
   a probe a string is used that indicates the problem.

   For traceRouteCtlIfIndex in the DISMAN-TRACEROUTE-MIB, a value of 0
   indicated, that it the option to set the index is not available.
   This was translated to the traceroute measurements data model, such
   that a value of 0 for this element indicates that the used interface
   is unknown.

   The element traceRouteProbeHistoryLastRC in the DISMAN-TRACEROUTE-MIB
   was replaced by element ResultsHopRawOutputData.  While
   traceRouteProbeHistoryLastRC just reports a reply code,
   ResultsHopRawOutputData reports the full raw output data produced by
   the traceroute measurements that was used.

C.3.  Additional Information Elements

   Only a few information elements have been added to the model of the
   DISMAN-TRACEROUTE-MIB module.

   o  For providing geographical information about hops in the
      traceroute measurement path, HopGeoLocation was added.
   o  For providing the top MPLS label stack entry of a probe in the
      traceroute measurement path MPLSTopLabel was added.
   o  For providing additional timestamp beyond ResultsEndDateAndTime,
      ResultsStartDateAndTime and Time were added.
