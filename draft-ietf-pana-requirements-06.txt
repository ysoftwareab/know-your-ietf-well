Currently there are   access-specific mechanisms for providing client information to the   network for authentication and authorization purposes. In addition   to being limited to specific access media (e.g., 802.1X for IEEE 802   links), some of these protocols are limited to specific network   topologies (e.g., PPP for point-to-point links). The goal of the   PANA is to provide a link-layer agnostic and IPv4/IPv6 compatible   client-server protocol that allows a host to be authenticated for   network access. The protocol will run between a client's device and   an agent device in the network where the agent might be a client of   the AAA infrastructure.

Expires Nov 2003               [Page 2]Internet Draft             PANA Requirements                 May 20031. Introduction   Providing secure network access service requires access control   based on the authentication and authorization of the clients and the   access networks. Initial and subsequent client-to-network   authentication provides parameters that are needed to police the   traffic flow through the enforcement points. A protocol is needed to   carry authentication methods between the client and the access   network. The IETF PANA Working Group has been chartered with the   goal of designing a network-layer access authentication protocol.   Link-layer authentication mechanisms are used as enablers of secure   network access. A higher-layer authentication is deemed necessary   when link-layer authentication mechanisms are either not available   for lack of technology or deployment difficulties; when link-layer   authentication mechanisms are not able to meet the overall   requirements; or when multi-layer (e.g., link-layer and   network-layer) authentication is needed. Currently there is no   standard network-layer solution for authenticating clients for   network access. In the absence of such a solution, some inadequate   standards-based solutions are deployed or non-standard ad-hoc   solutions are invented. The usage scenarios Internet-Draft [USAGE]   describes the problem statement in detail.   The protocol design will be limited to defining a client-server   messaging protocol (i.e., a carrier) that will allow authentication   payload to be carried between the host/client and an agent/server in   the access network for authentication and authorization purposes   regardless of the AAA infrastructure that may (or may not) reside on   the network. As a network-layer protocol, it will be independent of   the underlying access technologies. It will also be applicable to   any network topology.   The Working Group will not invent new security protocols and   mechanisms but instead it will use the existing mechanisms. In   particular, the Working Group will not define new authentication   protocols (e.g., EAP-TLS [EAPTLS]), key distribution or key   agreement protocols, or key derivation methods. The desired protocol   can be viewed as the front-end of the AAA protocol or any other   protocol/mechanisms the network is running at the background to   authenticate its clients. It will act as a carrier for an already   defined security protocol or mechanism.   As an example, the Mobile IP Working Group has already defined such   a carrier for Mobile IPv4 [MIPV4]. A Mobile IPv4 registration   request message is used as a carrier for authentication extensions   (MN-FA [MIPv4] or MN-AAA [MNAAA]) that allow a foreign agent to   authenticate mobile nodes before providing forwarding service. The   goal of PANA is similar in that it aims to define a network-layer   transport for authentication information; however, PANA will be   decoupled from mobility management and it will rely on other   specifications for the definition of authentication payloads.Yegin (Editor), et.al.

These terminology and   requirements will be used to define and limit the scope of the work   to be done in this group.2. Key Words   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].3. Terminology   PANA Client (PaC)        The entity wishing to obtain network access from a PANA        authentication agent within a network. A PANA client is        associated with a network device and a set of credentials to        prove its identity for network access authorization.   PANA Client Identifier (PaCI)        The identifier that is presented by the PaC to the PAA for        network access authentication. A simple username and NAI [NAI]        are examples of PANA client identifiers.   Device Identifier (DI)        The identifier used by the network as a handle to control and        police the network access of a client. Depending on the access        technology, this identifier might contain any of IP address,        link-layer address, switch port number, etc. of a connected        device.   PANA Authentication Agent (PAA)        The entity whose responsibility is to authenticate the        credentials provided by a PANA client and grant network        access service to the device associated with the client        and identified by a DI.   Enforcement Point (EP)        A node on the access network where per-packet enforcement        policies (i.e., filters) are applied on the inbound        and outbound traffic of client devices. Information such as DI        and (optionally) cryptographic keys are provided by PAA per        client for constructing filters on the EP.Yegin (Editor), et.al.

Authentication of Client   PANA MUST enable authentication of PaCs for network access. A PaC's   identity can be authenticated by verifying the credentials (e.g.,   identifier, authenticator) supplied by one of the users of the   device or the device itself. PANA MUST only grant network access   service to the device identified by the DI, rather than granting   separate access to multiple simultaneous users of the device. Once   the network access is granted to the device, the methods used by the   device on arbitrating which one of its users can access the network   is outside the scope of PANA.   PANA MUST NOT define new security protocols or mechanisms. Instead,   it MUST be defined as a "carrier" for such protocols. PANA MUST   identify which specific security protocol(s) or mechanism(s) it can   carry (the "payload"). The current thinking is that a sufficient   solution would be for PANA to carry EAP [EAP]. If the PANA WG   decides that extensions to EAP are needed, it will define   requirements for the EAP WG instead of designing such extensions.   Providing authentication, integrity and replay protection for data   traffic after a successful PANA exchange is outside the scope of   this protocol. In networks where physical layer security is not   present, link-layer or network-layer (e.g., IPsec) ciphering can be   used to provide such security. These mechanisms require presence of   cryptographic keying material at PaC and EP, which can be generated   by various EAP methods. Although PANA does not deal with key   derivation or distribution, it indirectly enables this by the virtue   of carrying EAP. The keying material produced by EAP methods cannot   be directly used with IPsec. In that case these initial keys can be   used with an IPsec key management protocol like IKE to generate the   required security associations. Key distribution from PAA to EP   SHOULD be handled by a separate protocol that takes care of   provisioning in the network (see section 4.4). Providing a complete   secure network access solution by also securing router discovery   [RDISC], neighbor discovery [NDISC], and address resolution   protocols [ARP] is outside the scope as well. Securing IPv6 router   discovery and neighbor discovery protocols are within the scope of   the IETF SEND Working Group.   Some access networks might require or allow their clients to get   authenticated and authorized by the NAP (network access provider)   and ISP before the clients gain network access. NAP is the owner of   the access network who provides physical and link-layer connectivity   to the clients. PANA MUST be capable of enabling two independent   authentication operations (i.e., execution of two separate EAP   methods) for the same client. Determining the authorizationYegin (Editor), et.al.        Expires Nov 2003               [Page 5]Internet Draft             PANA Requirements                 May 2003   parameters as a result of two separate authentications is an   operational issue and therefore it is outside the scope of PANA.   Both the PaC and the PAA MUST be able to authenticate each other for   network access. Providing only the capability of a PAA   authenticating the PaC is not sufficient. Mutual authentication   capability is necessary in some environments but not in all of them.   For example, clients might not need to authenticate the access   network when physical security is available (e.g., dial-up   networks).   PANA MUST be capable of carrying out both periodic and on-demand   re-authentication. Both the PaC and the PAA MUST be able to initiate   both the initial authentication and the re-authentication process.   Certain types of service theft are possible when the DI is not   protected during or after the PANA exchange [SECTHREAT]. PANA MUST   have the capability to exchange DI securely between the PAC and PAA   where the network is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. While   PANA MUST provide such a capability, its utility relies on the use   of an authentication method that can generate keys for cryptographic   computations on PaC and PAA.  4.1.2. Authorization, Accounting and Access Control   After a device is authenticated using PANA, it MUST be authorized   for network access. That is, the core requirement of PANA is to   verify the authorization of a PaC so that PaC’s device may send and   receive any IP packets. It may also be possible to provide finer   granularity authorization, such as authorization for QoS or   individual services (e.g., http vs. ssh). However, while a backend   authorization infrastructure (e.g., Diameter) might provide such   indications to the PAA, explicit support for them is outside the   scope of PANA. For instance, PANA is not required to carry any   indication of which services are authorized to the device.   Providing access control functionality in the network is outside the   scope of PANA. Client access authentication SHOULD be followed by   access control to make sure only authenticated and authorized   clients can send and receive IP packets via access network. Access   control can involve setting access control lists on the EPs.   Identification of clients that are authorized to access the network   is done by the PANA protocol exchange.   Carrying accounting data is outside the scope of PANA.  4.1.3. Authentication Backend   PANA protocol MUST NOT make any assumptions on the backend   authentication protocol or mechanisms. A PAA MAY interact withYegin (Editor), et.al.        Expires Nov 2003               [Page 6]Internet Draft             PANA Requirements                 May 2003   backend AAA infrastructures such as RADIUS or Diameter, but it is   not a requirement. When the access network does not rely on an   IETF-defined AAA protocol (e.g., RADIUS, Diameter), then it can   still use a proprietary backend system, or rely on the information   locally stored on the authentication agents.   The interaction between the PAA and the backend authentication   entities is outside the scope of PANA.  4.1.4. Identifiers   PANA SHOULD allow various types of identifiers to be used as the   PaCI (e.g., username, NAI, FQDN, etc.). This requirement generally   relies on the client identifiers supported by various EAP methods.   PANA SHOULD allow various types of identifiers to be used as the DI   (e.g., IP address, link-layer address, port number of a switch,   etc.).   A PAA MUST be able to create a binding between the PaCI and the   associated DI upon successful PANA exchange. This can be achieved by   PANA communicating the PaCI and DI to the PAA during the protocol   exchange. The DI can be carried either explicitly as part of the   PANA payload, or implicitly as the source of the PANA message, or   both. Multi-access networks also require use of a cryptographic   protection along with DI filtering to prevent unauthorized access   [SECTHREAT]. The keying material required by the cryptographic   methods needs to be indexed by the DI. The binding between DI and   PaCI is used for access control and accounting in the network as   described in section 4.1.2.4.2. IP Address Assignment   Providing address assignment functionality is outside the scope of   PANA. PANA protocol design MAY require the PaC to configure an IP   address before using this protocol. Allocating an IP address to   unauthenticated PaCs may create security vulnerabilities, such as IP   address depletion attacks on the access network [SECTHREAT]. IPv4   networks with limited address space are the main targets of such   attacks. Launching a successful attack that can deplete the   addresses in an IPv6 network is relatively harder.   This threat can be mitigated by allowing the protocol to run without   an IP address configured on the PaC (i.e., using unspecified source   address). Such a design choice might limit the re-use of existing   security mechanisms, and impose additional implementation   complexity. This trade off should be taken into consideration in   designing PANA.Yegin (Editor), et.al.        Expires Nov 2003               [Page 7]Internet Draft             PANA Requirements                 May 20034.3. EAP Lower Layer Requirements   The EAP protocol itself imposes various requirements on its   transport protocols. These requirements are based on the nature of   the EAP protocol, and need to be satisfied for correct operation.   Please see [EAP] for the generic transport requirements that MUST be   satisfied by PANA as well.4.4. PAA-to-EP Protocol   PANA does not assume that the PAA is always co-located with the   EP(s). Network access enforcement can be provided by one or more   nodes on the same IP subnet as the client (e.g., multiple routers),   or on another subnet in the access domain (e.g., gateway to the   Internet, depending on the network architecture). When the PAA and   the EP(s) are separated, there needs to be another transport for   client provisioning. This transport is needed to create access   control lists to allow authenticated and authorized clients' traffic   through the EPs. This WG will preferably identify an existing   protocol solution that allows the PAA to deliver the authorization   information to one or more EPs when the PAA is separated from EPs.   Possible candidates include but are not limited to COPS, SNMP,   Diameter. This task is similar to what the MIDCOM Working Group is   trying to achieve, therefore some of that WG's output might be   useful here.   It is assumed that the communication between PAA and EP(s) is   secure. The objective of using a PAA-to-EP protocol is to provide   filtering rules to EP(s) for allowing network access of a recently   authenticated and authorized PaC. The chosen protocol MUST be   capable of carrying DI and cryptographic keys for a given PaC from   PAA to EP. Depending on the PANA protocol design, support for either   of the pull model (i.e., EP initiating the PAA-to-EP protocol   exchange per PaC) or the push model (i.e., PAA initiating the   PAA-to-EP protocol exchange per PaC), or both MAY be required. For   example, if the design is such that the EP allows the PANA traffic   to pass through even for unauthenticated PaCs, the EP should also   allow and expect the PAA to send the filtering information at the   end of a successful PANA exchange without the EP ever sending a   request.4.5. Network  4.5.1. Multi-access   PANA MUST support PaCs with multiple interfaces, and networks with   multiple routers on multi-access links. In other words, PANA MUST   NOT assume the PaC has only one network interface, or the access   network has only one first hop router, or the PaC is using a   point-to-point link.Yegin (Editor), et.al.        Expires Nov 2003               [Page 8]Internet Draft             PANA Requirements                 May 2003  4.5.2. Disconnect Indication   PANA MUST NOT assume that the link is connection-oriented. Links may   or may not provide disconnect indication. Such notification is   desirable in order for the PAA to cleanup resources when a client   moves away from the network (e.g., inform the enforcement points   that the client is no longer connected). PANA SHOULD have a   mechanism to provide disconnect indication. When such indications   are not protected by means of physical or link-layer mechanisms,   PANA MUST ensure this protection to prevent attackers from   leveraging this extension for DoS attacks.   This mechanism MUST allow the PAA to be notified about the departure   of a PaC from the network. This mechanism MUST also allow a PaC to   be notified about the discontinuation of the network access service.   Access discontinuation can happen due to various reasons such as   network systems going down, or a change in access policy.   In case the clients cannot send explicit disconnect messages to the   PAA, PAA can still detect their departure by relying on periodic   authentication requests.  4.5.3. Location of PAA   The PAA and PaC MUST be exactly one IP hop away from each other.   That is, there must be no IP routers between the two. Note that this   does not mean they are on the same physical link. Bridging   techniques can place two nodes just exactly one IP hop away from   each other although they might be connected to separate physical   links. Furthermore, two nodes on the same IP subnet do not   necessarily satisfy this requirement, as they can be more than one   hop away from each other [MULTILINK]. A PAA can be on the NAS   (network access server) or WLAN access point or first hop router.   The use of PANA when the PAA is multiple IP hops away from the PaC   is outside the scope of PANA.   A PaC MAY NOT be pre-configured with the IP address of PAA.   Therefore the PANA protocol MUST define a dynamic discovery method.   Given that the PAA is one hop away from the PaC, there are a number   of discovery techniques that could be used (e.g., multicast or   anycast) by the PaC to find out the address of the PAA.  4.5.4. Secure Channel   PANA MUST NOT assume presence of a secure channel between the PaC   and the PAA. PANA MUST be able to provide authentication especially   in networks which are not protected against eavesdropping andYegin (Editor), et.al.        Expires Nov 2003               [Page 9]Internet Draft             PANA Requirements                 May 2003   spoofing. PANA MUST enable protection against replay attacks on both   PaCs and PAAs.   This requirement partially relies on the EAP protocol and the EAP   methods carried over PANA. Use of EAP methods that provide mutual   authentication and key derivation/distribution is essential for   satisfying this requirement. EAP does not make a secure channel   assumption, and supports various authentication methods that can be   used in such environments. Additionally, PANA MUST ensure its design   does not contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited when it is   used over insecure channels. PANA MAY provide a secure channel by   deploying a two-phase authentication. The first phase can be used   for creation of the secure channel, and the second phase is for   client and network authentication.4.6. Interaction with Other Protocols   Mobility management is outside the scope of PANA. However, PANA MUST   be able to co-exist and not interfere with various mobility   management protocols, such as Mobile IPv4 [MIPV4], Mobile IPv6   [MIPV6], fast handover protocols [FMIPV4, FMIPV6], and other   standard protocols like IPv6 stateless address auto-configuration   [ADDRCONF] (including privacy extensions [PRIVACY]), and DHCP   [DHCP]. It MUST NOT make any assumptions on the protocols or   mechanisms used for IP address configuration of the PaC.4.7. Performance   PANA design SHOULD give consideration to efficient handling of the   authentication process. This is important for gaining network access   with minimum latency. As an example, a method like minimizing the   protocol signaling by creating local security associations can be   used for this purpose.4.8. Congestion Control   PANA MUST provide congestion control for the protocol messaging.   Under certain conditions PaCs might unintentionally get synchronized   when sending their requests to the PAA (e.g., upon recovering from a   power outage on the access network). The network congestion   generated from such events can be avoided by using techniques like   delayed initialization and exponential back off.4.9. IP Version Independence   PANA MUST work with both IPv4 and IPv6.Yegin (Editor), et.al.        Expires Nov 2003              [Page 10]Internet Draft             PANA Requirements                 May 20034.10. Denial of Service Attacks   PANA MUST be robust against a class of DoS attacks such as blind   masquerade attacks through IP spoofing that would swamp the PAA,   causing it to spend resources and prevent network access by   legitimate clients.4.11. Client Identity Privacy   Some clients might prefer hiding their identity from visited access   networks for privacy reasons. Providing identity protection for   clients is outside the scope of PANA. Note that some authentication   methods may already have this capability. Where necessary, identity   protection can be achieved by letting PANA carry such authentication   methods.5. Security Considerations   This document identifies requirements for the PANA protocol design.   Due to the nature of this protocol most of the requirements are   security related. The actual protocol design is not specified in   this document.6.

Appendix   A. PANA Model   Following sub-sections capture the PANA usage model in different   network architectures with reference to its placement of logical   elements such as the PANA Client (PaC) and the PANA Authentication   Agent (PAA) with respect to the Enforcement Point (EP) and the   Access Router (AR). Four different scenarios are described in   following sub-sections.  Note that PAA may or may not use AAA   infrastructure to verify the credentials of PaC to authorize network   access.   A.1.  PAA Co-located with EP But Separated from AR   In this scenario (Figure 1), PAA is co-located with the enforcement   point on which access control is performed.  PaCs communicate with   the PAA for network access on behalf of a device (D1, D2, etc.).   PANA in this case provides a means to transport the authentication   parameters from the PaC to PAA.  PAA knows how to verify the   credentials.  After verification, PAA sends back the success or   failure response to PaC.  However, PANA does not play any explicit   role in performing access control except that it provides a hook to   access control mechanisms. This might be the case where PAA isYegin (Editor), et.al.

PAA Co-located with AR but Separated From EP   Figure 2 describes this model. In this scenario, PAA is not   co-located with EPs but it is placed on the AR. Although we have   shown only one AR here there could be multiple ARs, one of which is   co-located with the PAA. PaC exchanges the same messages with PAA as   discussed earlier. The difference here is when the initial   authentication for the PaC succeeds, access control parameters are   to be distributed to respective enforcement points so that the   corresponding device on which PaC is authenticated must be able to   access to the network. Similar to the earlier case, PANA does not   play any explicit role in performing access control except that it   provides a hook to access control mechanisms.  However, a separate   protocol is needed between PAA and EP to carry access control   parameters.           PaC  -------- EP --+           [D1]               |                              +--- AR/PAA --- (AAA)                              |           PaC  -------- EP --+           [D2]           Figure 2: PAA co-located with AR but separated from EP.   A.3.  PAA Co-located with EP and AR   In this scenario (Figure 3), PAA is co-located with the EP and AR on   which access control and routing are performed.  PaC exchanges the   same messages with PAA and PAA performs similar functionalities as   before. PANA in this case also does not play any explicit role in   performing access control except that it provides a hook to access   control mechanisms.Yegin (Editor), et.al.

PAA Separated from EP and AR   Figure 4 represents this model. In this scenario, PAA is neither   co-located with EPs nor with ARs. It still resides on the same IP   link as ARs. PaC does similar exchanges with PAA as discussed   earlier. Similar to model in A.2, after successful authentication,   access control parameters will be distributed to respective   enforcement points via a separate protocol and PANA does not play   any explicit role in this.             PaC ----- EP -----+- AR -----+                               |          |             PaC ----- EP --- -+          |                               |          |             PaC ----- EP -----+- AR ---- + ----(AAA)                               |                               +- PAA             Figure 4: PAA separated from EP and AR.11.
