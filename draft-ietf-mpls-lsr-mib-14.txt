1. Introduction
   
   This memo defines an portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols
   in the Internet community.  In particular, it describes managed
   objects for modeling a Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)
   [RFC3031] Label Switching Router (LSR).

   Comments should be made directly to the MPLS mailing list at
   mpls@uu.net.
   
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   RFC 2119, reference [RFC2119].

2. Terminology
   
   This document uses terminology from the document describing the
   MPLS architecture [RFC3031].  A label switched path (LSP) is



MPLS Working Group              Expires May 2004             [Page 2]

Internet Draft           MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB           November 24, 2003



   modeled as a connection consisting of one or more incoming
   segments (in-segments) and/or one or more outgoing segments (out-
   segments) at a LSR.  The association or interconnection 
   of the in-segments and out-segments is accomplished by 
   using a cross-connect.  We use the terminology
   "connection" and "LSP" interchangeably where the meaning is clear
   from the context.

   in-segment	  This is analagous to an MPLS label.
   out-segment    This is analagous to an MPLS label.
   cross-connect  This describes the conceptual connection
                  between a set of in-segments and out-segments.
                  Note that either set may be 0; that is, a 
                  cross-connect may connect only out-segments 
                  together with no in-segments in the case 
                  where an LSP is originating on an LSR.

3. The SNMP Management Framework
   
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

4. Outline
   
   Configuring LSPs through an LSR involves the following steps:
   
   -  Enabling MPLS on MPLS capable interfaces.
   
   -  Configuring in-segments and out-segments.
   
   -  Setting up the cross-connect table to associate segments and/or
      to indicate connection origination and termination.
   
   -  Optionally specifying label stack actions.
   
   -  Optionally specifying segment traffic parameters.

4.1.  Summary of LSR MIB Module
   
   The MIB objects for performing these actions consist of the

Internet Draft           MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB           November 24, 2003



   following tables:
   
   -  The interface table (mplsInterfaceTable), 
      which is used for revealing the MPLS protocol on 
      MPLS-capable interfaces.
   
   -  The in-segment (mplsInSegmentTable) and out-segment
      (mplsOutSegmentTable) tables, which are used for configuring
      LSP segments at an LSR.
   
   -  The cross-connect table (mplsXCTable), which is used to
      associate in and out segments together, in order to form a
      cross-connect.
   
   -  The label stack table (mplsLabelStackTable), which is used for
      specifying label stack operations.
   
   Further, the MPLS in-segment and out-segment performance tables,
   mplsInSegmentPerfTable and mplsOutSegmentPerfTable, contain the
   objects necessary to measure the performance of LSPs, and
   mplsInterfacePerfTable has objects to measure MPLS performance on
   a per-interface basis.
   
   These tables are described in the subsequent sections.

5. Brief Description of MIB Module Objects
   
   Sections 5.1-5.2 describe objects pertaining to MPLS-capable
   interfaces of an LSR.  The objects described in Sections 5.3-5.8,
   were derived from the Incoming Label Map (ILM) and Next Hop Label
   Forwarding Entry (NHLFE) as specified in the MPLS architecture
   document [RFC3031]. It is appropriate to note that the in-segment, 
   out-segment, and cross-connect tables were modeled after similar 
   tables found in [RFC2515].

5.1.   mplsInterfaceTable
   
   This table represents the interfaces that are MPLS capable.  An
   LSR creates an entry in this table for every MPLS capable
   interface on that LSR.

5.2.  mplsInterfacePerfTable
   
   This table contains objects to measure the MPLS performance of
   MPLS capable interfaces and is an AUGMENT to
   mplsInterfaceTable.

5.3.  mplsInSegmentTable
   
   This table contains a description of the incoming MPLS segments



MPLS Working Group              Expires May 2004             [Page 4]

Internet Draft           MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB           November 24, 2003



   to an LSR and their associated parameters. This index for this
   table is mplsInSegmentIndex. The index structure of this 
   table is specifically designed to handle many different 
   MPLS implementations that manage their labels both in a 
   distributed and centralized manner. 
   
   The table is designed to handle existing MPLS labels as 
   well as future label strategies that may require labels
   longer than the ones defined in RFC3031.  In these cases, 
   the object mplsInSegmentLabelPtr may be used indicate
   the first accessible object in a separate table that can be 
   used to represent the label because it is too long to
   be represented in a single 32-bit value (mplsInSegmentLabel).
   
5.4.  mplsInSegmentPerfTable

   The MPLS in-Segment Performance Table has objects to measure
   the performance of an incoming segment configured on an LSR.  It
   is an AUGMENT to mplsInSegmentTable.  High capacity counters are
   provided for objects that are likely to wrap around quickly on
   high-speed interfaces.

5.5.  mplsOutSegmentTable
   
   The out-Segment Table contains a description of the outgoing MPLS
   segments at an LSR and their associated parameters.

5.6.  mplsOutSegmentPerfTable
   
   The MPLS out-Segment Table contains objects to measure the
   performance of an outgoing segment configured on an LSR.  It is 
   an AUGMENT to mplsOutSegmentTable.  High capacity counters are
   provided for objects that are likely to wrap around quickly on
   high-speed interfaces.

5.7.  mplsXCTable
   
   The mplsXCTable specifies information for associating segments
   together in order to instruct the LSR to switch between the
   specified segments.  It supports point-to-point, point-to-multi-
   point and multi-point-to-point connections.
   
   The operational status object indicates the packet forwarding
   state of a cross-connect entry. For example, when the operational
   status objects is 'down' it indicates that the specified cross-
   connect entry will not forward packets.  Likewise, when it is set
   to 'up' it indicates that packets will be forwarded.
   
   The administrative status object indicates the forwarding state
   desired by the operator.

Internet Draft           MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB           November 24, 2003




5.8.  mplsLabelStackTable
   
   The mplsLabelStackTable specifies the label stack to be pushed
   onto a packet, beneath the top label.  Entries to this table are
   referred to from mplsXCTable.

5.9   mplsInSegmentMapTable

   The mplsInSegmentMapTable specifies the mapping from the 
   mplsInSegmentIndex to the corresponding mplsInSegmentInterface 
   and mplsInSegmentLabel objects. The purpose of this table is 
   to provide the manager with an alternative means by which to 
   locate in-segments.  For instance, this table can be useful
   when tracing LSPs from LSR to LSR by first following the
   in-segment to out-segment, retrieving the outgoing label
   and out-going interface, and then proceeding to interrogate
   this table at the next-hop LSR to continue the trace.

6. Use of 32-bit and 64-bit Counters
   
   64-bit counters are provided in this MIB module for high speed 
   interfaces where the use of 32-bit counters might be impractical. 
   The requirements on the use of 32-bit and 64-bit counters (copied
   verbatim from [RFC2863]) are as follows.
   
   For interfaces that operate at 20,000,000 (20 million) bits per
   second or less, 32-bit byte and packet counters MUST be supported.
   For interfaces that operate faster than 20,000,000 bits/second,
   and slower than 650,000,000 bits/second, 32-bit packet counters
   MUST be supported and 64-bit octet counters MUST be supported.
   For interfaces that operate at 650,000,000 bits/second or faster,
   64-bit packet counters AND 64-bit octet counters MUST be
   supported.

7. Example of LSP Setup
   
   In this section we provide a brief example of setting up an LSP
   using this MIB module's objects.  While this example
   is not meant to illustrate every nuance of the MIB module, it 
   is intended as an aid to understanding some of the key concepts.  
   It is meant to be read after going through the MIB module itself.
   
   Suppose that one would like to manually create a best-effort,
   unidirectional LSP.  Assume that the LSP enters the LSR via MPLS
   interface A with ifIndex 12 and exits the LSR via MPLS interface B
   with ifIndex 13.  Let us assume that we do not wish to impose any
   additional label stack beneath the top label on the outgoing 
   labeled packets. The following example illustrates which rows and 
   corresponding objects might be created to accomplish this. Those

Internet Draft           MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB           November 24, 2003



   objects relevant to illustrating the relationships amongst 
   different tables are shown here. Other objects may be needed
   before conceptual row activation can happen.
   
   The RowStatus values shown in this section are those to be used in
   the set request, typically createAndGo(4) which is used to create
   the conceptual row and have its status immediately set to active.
   Note that the proper use of createAndGo(4) requires that all
   columns that do not have a DEFVAL to be specified in order for
   the SET to succeed. In the example below we have not specify all 
   such columns for the sake of keeping the example short. Please
   keep in mind that all such fields must be send during a real SET 
   operation.  A subsequent retrieval operation on the conceptual 
   row will return a different value, such as active(1). Please see 
   [RFC2579] for a detailed discussion on the use of RowStatus.
   
   We first create a cross-connect entry that associates the
   desired segments together.
   
   In mplsXCTable:
   {
      mplsXCIndex                = 0x02,
      mplsXCInSegmentIndex       = 0x00000015,
      mplsXCOutSegmentIndex      = 0x01,

      mplsXCLspId                = 0x0102 -- unique ID
      mplsXCLabelStackIndex      = 0x00, -- only a single
                                         -- outgoing label
      mplsXCRowStatus            = createAndGo(4)
   }

   Next, we create the appropriate in-segment and out-segment
   entries based on the cross-connect. Note that some agents
   may wish to automatically create the in and out-segments
   based on the cross-connect creation.
   
   
   In mplsInSegmentTable:
   {
      mplsInSegmentIndex              = 0x00000015

      mplsInSegmentLabel              = 21, -- incoming label
      mplsInSegmentNPop               = 1,
      mplsInSegmentInterface          = 12, -- incoming interface

      -- RowPointer MUST point to the first accesible column.
      mplsInSegmentLabelPtr           = 0.0,
      mplsInSegmentTrafficParamPtr    = 0.0,

      mplsInSegmentRowStatus          = createAndGo(4)



MPLS Working Group              Expires May 2004             [Page 7]

Internet Draft           MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB           November 24, 2003



   }
   
   In mplsOutSegmentTable:
   {
      mplsOutSegmentIndex             = 0x01,
      mplsOutSegmentInterface         = 13, -- outgoing interface
      mplsOutSegmentPushTopLabel      = true(1),
      mplsOutSegmentTopLabel          = 22, -- outgoing label

      -- RowPointer MUST point to the first accesible column.
      mplsOutSegmentTrafficParamPtr   = 0.0,
      mplsOutSegmentLabelPtr          = 0.0,

      mplsOutSegmentRowStatus         = createAndGo(4)
   }
   
   Note that the mplsInSegmentXCIndex and mplsOutSegmentXCIndex
   objects will automatically be populated with the string 0x02 
   when these segments are referred to from the corresponding 
   cross- connect entry.

8. Application of the Interface Group to MPLS
   
   RFC2863 defines generic managed objects for managing 
   interfaces.  This memo contains the media-specific
   extensions to the Interfaces Group for managing MPLS interfaces.
   
   This memo assumes the interpretation of the Interfaces Group to be
   in accordance with [RFC2863] which states that the interfaces
   table (ifTable) contains information on the managed resource's
   interfaces and that each sub-layer below the internetwork layer of
   a network interface is considered an interface.  Thus, the MPLS
   interface is represented as an entry in the ifTable.  The inter-
   relation of entries in the ifTable is defined by Interfaces Stack
   Group defined in [RFC2863].
   
   When using MPLS interfaces, the interface stack table might appear
   as follows:
      
      +----------------------------------------+
      |   MPLS interface; ifType = mpls(166)   +
      +----------------------------------------+
      |            Underlying Layer            +
      +----------------------------------------+
   
   In the above diagram, "Underlying Layer" refers to the ifIndex of
   any interface type for which MPLS interworking has been defined.
   Examples include ATM, Frame Relay, Ethernet, etc.

8.1.  Support of the MPLS Layer by ifTable

   ifOutOctets   The number of transmitted octets over the
                 interface, i.e., the number of octets transmitted

9.   The Use of RowPointer

   RowPointer is a textual convention used to identify a conceptual
   row in a MIB Table by pointing to the first accessible object
   in that row. In this MIB module, the trafficParamPtr object from 
   either the mplsInSegmentTable or mplsOutSegmentTable SHOULD 
   indicate the first accessible column in an entry in the
   MplsTunnelResourceEntry in the MPLS-TE-STD-MIB [TEMIB]
   to indicate the traffic parameter settings for this
   segment, if it represents an LSP used for a TE tunnel.
      
   The trafficParamPtr object may optionally point at an
   externally defined traffic parameter specification
   table. A value of zeroDotZero indicates best-effort
   treatment. By having the same value of this object,
   two or more segments can indicate resource sharing
   of such things as LSP queue space, etc.

-- Textual Conventions

MplsIndexType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
   STATUS              current
   DESCRIPTION
       "This is an octet string that can be used as a table
        index in cases where a large addressable space is
        required such as on an LSR where many applications
        may be provisioning labels.
 	
        Note that the string containing the single octet with
        the value 0x00 is a reserved value used to represent
        special cases. When this textual convention is used 
        as the SYNTAX of an object, the DESCRITPION clause 
        MUST specify if this special value is valid and if so 
        what the special meaning is.
	
        In systems that provide write access to the MPLS-LSR-STD 
        MIB, mplsIndexType SHOULD be used as a simple multi-digit
        integer encoded as an octet string.
        No further overloading of the meaning of an index SHOULD
        be made.

        In systems that do not offer write access to the MPLS-LSR-STD 
        MIB, the mplsIndexType may contain implicit formatting that is
        specific to the implementation to convey additional
        information such as interface index, physical card or
        device, or application id. The interpretation of this
        additional formatting is implementation dependent and
        not covered in this document. Such formatting MUST
        NOT impact the basic functionality of read-only access
        to the MPLS-LSR-STD MIB by management applications that are
        not aware of the formatting rules."

MplsIndexNextType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
   STATUS              current
   DESCRIPTION
       "When a MIB module is used for configuration, an object with 
        this SYNTAX always contains a legal value (a non-zero-length
        string) for an index that is not currently used in the relevant 
        table. The Command Generator (Network Management Application) 
        reads this variable and uses the (non-zero-length string) 
        value read when creating a new row with an SNMP SET.
	
        When the SET is performed, the Command Responder (agent) must
        determine whether the value is indeed still unused; Two Network
        Management Applications may attempt to create a row

        (configuration entry) simultaneously and use the same value. If
        it is currently unused, the SET succeeds and the Command
        Responder (agent) changes the value of this object, according 
        to an implementation-specific algorithm.  If the value is in 
        use, however, the SET fails.  The Network Management 
        Application must then re-read this variable to obtain a new 
        usable value.
	
        Note that the string containing the single octet with
        the value 0x00 is a reserved value used to represent
        the special case where no additional indexes can be
        provisioned, or in systems that do not offer
        write access, objects defined using this textual 
        convention MUST return the string containing the single 
        octet with the value 0x00."

11.   Security Considerations
   
   It is clear that this MIB module is potentially useful for 
   monitoring of MPLS LSRs.  This MIB can also be used for 



MPLS Working Group             Expires May 2004             [Page 52]

Internet Draft           MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB           November 24, 2003



   configuration of certain objects, and anything that can be 
   configured can be incorrectly configured, with potentially 
   disastrous results.
   
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o    the mplsLsrInSegmentTable, mplsLsrOutSegmentTable,
        mplsXCTable, mplsOutSegmentPerfTable, mplsInterfacePerfTable, 
        and mplsInSegmentPerfTable collectively contain objects to 
        provision MPLS interfaces, LSPs and their associated parameters
        on an Label Switching Router (LSR).  Unauthorized access to 
        objects in these tables, could result in disruption of traffic 
        on the network.  This is especially true if an LSP has been
        established.  The use of stronger mechanisms such as SNMPv3
        security should be considered where possible.  Specifically,
        SNMPv3 VACM and USM MUST be used with any v3 agent which
        implements this MIB module.  Administrators should consider 
        whether read access to these objects should be allowed, 
        since read access may be undesirable under certain 
        circumstances.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module "i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible" may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o    the mplsLsrInSegmentTable, mplsLsrOutSegmentTable,
        mplsXCTable, mplsOutSegmentPerfTable, mplsInterfacePerfTable, 
        and mplsInSegmentPerfTable collectively show the LSP network
        topology and its performance characteristics.  
        If an Administrator does not want to reveal this
        information, then these tables should be
        considered sensitive/vulnerable.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure "for example by using IPSec",
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET "read/change/create/delete" the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as

   provided by the SNMPv3 framework "see [RFC3410], section 8",
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms "for
   authentication and privacy".

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access 
   to the objects only to those principals "users" that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET "change/create/delete" them.

13.  IANA Considerations
   As described in [MPLSMGMT] and as requested in the MPLS-TC-STD-MIB
   [MPLSTCMIB], MPLS related standards track MIB modules should be
   rooted under the mplsStdMIB subtree.  There are 4 MPLS MIB Modules
   contained in this document, each of the following "IANA
   Considerations" subsections requests IANA for a new assignment under
   the mplsStdMIB subtree.  New assignments can only be made via a
   Standards Action as specified in [RFC2434].

13.1.  IANA Considerations for MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB
   The IANA is requested to assign { mplsStdMIB 2 } to the 
   MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB module specified in this document.
