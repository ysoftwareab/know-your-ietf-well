               Advertising Tunnelling Capability in IS-IS
                  draft-ietf-isis-encapsulation-cap-01

Abstract

   Some networks use tunnels for a variety of reasons.  A large variety
   of tunnel types are defined and the ingress needs to select a type of
   tunnel which is supported by the egress.  This document defines how
   to advertise egress tunnel capabilities in IS-IS Router Capability
   TLV.

1.  Introduction

   Some networks use tunnels for a variety of reasons, such as:

   o  Partial deployment of MPLS-SPRING as described in
      [I-D.xu-mpls-unified-source-routing-instruction], where IP tunnels
      are used between MPLS-SPRING-enabled routers so as to traverse
      non- MPLS routers.

   o  Partial deployment of MPLS-BIER as described in Section 6.9 of
      [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture], where IP tunnels are used between

Internet-Draft                                                April 2017


      MPLS-BIER-capable routers so as to traverse non MPLS-BIER
      [I-D.ietf-bier-mpls-encapsulation] routers.

   o  Partial deployment of IPv6 (resp.  IPv4) in IPv4 (resp.  IPv6)
      networks as described in [RFC5565], where IPvx tunnels are used
      between IPvx-enabled routers so as to traverse non-IPvx routers.

   o  Remote Loop Free Alternate repair tunnels as described in
      [RFC7490], where tunnels are used between the Point of Local
      Repair and the selected PQ node.

   The ingress needs to select a type of tunnel which is supported by
   the egress.  This document describes how to use IS-IS Router
   Capability TLV to advertise the egress tunnelling capabilities of
   nodes.

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC4971].

3.  Advertising Encapsulation Capability

   Routers advertises their supported encapsulation type(s) by
   advertising a new sub-TLV of the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV
   [RFC4971], referred to as Encapsulation Capability sub-TLV.  This
   sub-TLV SHOULD NOT appear more than once within a given IS-IS Router
   CAPABILITY TLV.  The scope of the advertisement depends on the
   application but it is recommended that it SHOULD be domain-wide.  The
   Type code of the Encapsulation Capability sub-TLV is TBD1, the Length
   value is variable, and the Value field contains one or more Tunnel
   Encapsulation Type sub-TLVs.  Each Encapsulation Type sub-TLVs
   indicates a particular encapsulation format that the advertising
   router supports.

4.  Tunnel Encapsulation Type

   The Tunnel Encapsulation Type sub-TLV is structured as follows:

        0                   1                   2                   3

       |                             Value                             |

      Tunnel Type (1 octets): identifies the type of tunneling
      technology being signaled.  This document defines the following
      types:

      1.   L2TPv3 over IP [RFC3931] : Type code=1;

      2.   GRE [RFC2784] : Type code=2;

      3.   Transmit tunnel endpoint [RFC5566] : Type code=3;

      4.   IPsec in Tunnel-mode [RFC5566] : Type code=4;

           code=5;

      6.   MPLS-in-IP tunnel with IPsec Transport Mode [RFC5566] : Type
           code=6;

      7.   IP in IP [RFC2003] [RFC4213]: Type code=7;

      8.   VXLAN [RFC7348] : Type code=8;

      9.   NVGRE [RFC7637] : Type code=9;

      10.  MPLS [RFC3032] : Type code=10;

      11.  MPLS-in-GRE [RFC4023] : Type code=11;

      12.  VXLAN GPE [I-D.ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe] : Type code=12;

      13.  MPLS-in-UDP [RFC7510] : Type code=13;

      14.  MPLS-in-UDP-with-DTLS [RFC7510] : Type code=14;

      15.  MPLS-in-L2TPv3 [RFC4817] : Type code=15;

      16.  GTP: Type code=16;

      Unknown types are to be ignored and skipped upon receipt.

      Length (1 octets): unsigned integer indicating the total number of
      octets of the value field.

      Value (variable): zero or more Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute sub-
      TLVs as defined in Section 5.

5.  Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute

   The Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute sub-TLV is structured as as
   follows:

                           +-----------------------------------+
                           |      Sub-TLV Type (1 Octet)       |
                           +-----------------------------------+
                           |     Sub-TLV Length (1 Octet)      |
                           +-----------------------------------+
                           |     Sub-TLV Value (Variable)      |
                           |                                   |
                           +-----------------------------------+

      Sub-TLV Type (1 octet): each sub-TLV type defines a certain
      property about the tunnel TLV that contains this sub-TLV.  The
      following are the types defined in this document:

      1.  Encapsulation Parameters: sub-TLV type = 1; (See Section 5.1)

      2.  Encapsulated Protocol: sub-TLV type = 2; (See Section 5.2)

      3.  End Point: sub-TLV type = 3; (See Section 5.3)

      4.  Color: sub-TLV type = 4; (See Section 5.4)

      Sub-TLV Length (1 octet): unsigned integer indicating the total
      number of octets of the sub-TLV value field.

      Sub-TLV Value (variable): encodings of the value field depend on
      the sub-TLV type as enumerated above.  The following sub-sections
      define the encoding in detail.

   Any unknown sub-TLVs MUST be ignored and skipped.  However, if the
   TLV is understood, the entire TLV MUST NOT be ignored just because it
   contains an unknown sub-TLV.

   If a sub-TLV is erroneous, this specific Tunnel Encapsulation MUST be
   ignored and skipped.  However, others Tunnel Encapsulations MUST be
   considered.

5.1.  Tunnel Parameters sub-TLV

   This sub-TLV has its format defined in [RFC5512] under the name
   Encapsulation sub-TLV.

5.2.  Encapsulated Protocol sub-TLV

   This sub-TLV has its format defined in [RFC5512] under the name
   Protocol Type.

5.3.  End Point sub-TLV

   The value field carries the Network Address to be used as tunnel
   destination address.

   If length is 4, the Address Family (AFI) is IPv4.

   If length is 16, the Address Family (AFI) is IPv6.

5.4.  Color sub-TLV

   The valued field is a 4 octets opaque unsigned integer.

   The color value is user defined and configured locally on the
   routers.  It may be used by the service providers to define policies.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  IS-IS Router Capability

   This document requests IANA to allocate a new code point from
   registry IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV.

   Assignments of Encapsulation Attribute Types are via Standards Action
   [RFC5226].

7.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations applicable to softwires can be found in the
   mesh framework [RFC5565].  In general, security issues of the tunnel
   protocols signaled through this IGP capability extension are
   inherited.

   If a third party is able to modify any of the information that is
   used to form encapsulation headers, to choose a tunnel type, or to
   choose a particular tunnel for a particular payload type, user data
   packets may end up getting misrouted, misdelivered, and/or dropped.

   Security considerations for the base IS-IS protocol are covered in
   [RFC1195].
