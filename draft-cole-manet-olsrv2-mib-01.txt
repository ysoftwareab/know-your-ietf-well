Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring and managing
   aspects of the Optimized Link State Routing protocol version 2.  The
   Optimized Link State Routing MIB also reports state information,
   performance metrics, and notifications.  In addition to
   configuration, this additional state and performance information is
   useful to management stations troubleshooting Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks
   routing problems.

Internet-Draft               The OLSRv2-MIB                February 2009


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring aspects of a
   process implementing the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol
   version 2 (OLSRv2) [I-D.ietf-manet-olsrv2].  OLSRv2 provides ...

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol version 2 (OLSRv2)
   provides ...

4.1.  OLSRv2 Management Model

   This section describes the management model for the OLSRv2 node
   routing process.  Specifically, ...

4.2.  Terms

   The following definitions apply throughout this document:

   o  Configuration Objects - switches, tables, objects which are
      initialized to default settings or set through the management
      interface defined by this MIB.

Internet-Draft               The OLSRv2-MIB                February 2009


   o  Tunable Configuration Objects - objects whose values affect timing
      or attempt bounds on the OLSRv2 routing process.

   o  State Objects - automatically generated values which define the
      current operating state of the OLSRv2 routing process in the
      router.

   o  Performance Objects - automatically generated values which help an
      administrator or automated tool to assess the performance of the
      OLSRv2 routing process on the router and the overall packet
      forwarding performance within the MANET routing domain.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This section presents the structure of the Optimized Link State
   Routing version 2 Management Information Base (OLSRv2-MIB) module.
   The objects are arranged into the following groups:

   o  olsrMIBNotifications - defines the notifications associated with
      the OLSRv2-MIB.

   o  olsrMIBObjects - defines the objects forming the basis for the
      OLSRv2-MIB.  These objects are divided up by function into the
      following groups:

   o

      *  Configuration Group - This group contains the OLSR objects that
         configure specific options that determine the overall operation
         of the OLSR routing process and the unicast packet forwarding
         performance.

      *  State Group - Contains information describing the current state
         of the OLSR routing process such as the ...

      *  Performance Group - Contains objects which help to characterize
         the performance of the OLSR routing process, typically
         statistics counters.

   o  olsrMIBConformance - defines minimal and full conformance of
      implementations to this OLSRv2-MIB.

5.1.  Textual Conventions

   The textual conventions used in the OLSRv2-MIB are as follows.  The
   RowStatus textual convention is imported from RFC 2579 [RFC2579].
   Further, ...

5.2.  The Configuration Group

   The OLSR device is configured with a set of controls.  The list of
   configuration controls for the OLSR device follow.

   o  ...

5.3.  The State Group

   The State Subtree reports current state information.  Specifically,
   ...

   o  ...

5.4.  The Performance Group

   The Performance subtree reports primarily counters that relate to
   OLSR routing performance.  Specifically, ...

   o  ...

5.5.  The Notifications Group

   The Notifications Subtree contains the list of notifications
   supported within the OLSRv2-MIB and their intended purpose or
   utility.  This group is currently empty.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   [TODO]: The text of this section specifies the relationship of the
   MIB modules contained in this document to other standards,
   particularly to standards containing other MIB modules.  Definitions
   imported from other MIB modules and other MIB modules that SHOULD be
   implemented in conjunction with the MIB module contained within this
   document are identified in this section.

6.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] is defined as being
   mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a
   whole.  The 'system' group provides identification of the management
   entity and certain other system-wide data.  The OLSRv2-MIB does not
   duplicate those objects.

6.2.  Relationship to the IF-MIB

   [TODO] This section is included as an example; If the MIB module is
   not an adjunct of the Interface MIB, then this section should be

   removed.

6.3.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   [TODO]: Citations are not permitted within a MIB module, but any
   module mentioned in an IMPORTS clause or document mentioned in a
   REFERENCE clause is a Normative reference, and must be cited
   someplace within the narrative sections.  If there are imported items
   in the MIB module, such as Textual Conventions, that are not already
   cited, they can be cited in text here.  Since relationships to other
   MIB modules should be described in the narrative text, this section
   is typically used to cite modules from which Textual Conventions are
   imported.

   The following OLSRv2-MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI
   [RFC2578], SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], and IF-MIB
   [RFC2863]

8.  Security Considerations

   [TODO] Each specification that defines one or more MIB modules MUST
   contain a section that discusses security considerations relevant to
   those modules.  This section MUST be patterned after the latest
   approved template (available at
   http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-security.html).  Remember that the
   objective is not to blindly copy text from the template, but rather
   to think and evaluate the risks/vulnerabilities and then state/
   document the result of this evaluation.

   [TODO] if you have any read-write and/or read-create objects, please
   include the following boilerplate paragraph.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  [TODO] writable MIB objects that could be especially disruptive if
      abused MUST be explicitly listed by name and the associated
      security risks MUST be spelled out; RFC 2669 has a very good
      example.

   o  [TODO] list the writable tables and objects and state why they are
      sensitive.

   [TODO] else if there are no read-write objects in your MIB module,
   use the following boilerplate paragraph.

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   [TODO] if you have any sensitive readable objects, please include the
   following boilerplate paragraph.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  [TODO] you must explicitly list by name any readable objects that
      are sensitive or vulnerable and the associated security risks MUST
      be spelled out (for instance, if they might reveal customer
      information or violate personal privacy laws such as those of the
      European Union if exposed to unauthorized parties)

   o  [TODO] list the tables and objects and state why they are
      sensitive.

   [TODO] discuss what security the protocol used to carry the
   information should have.  The following three boilerplate paragraphs
   should not be changed without very good reason.  Changes will almost
   certainly require justification during IESG review.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  IANA Considerations

   [TODO] In order to comply with IESG policy as set forth in
   http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html, every Internet-Draft that is
   submitted to the IESG for publication MUST contain an IANA
   Considerations section.  The requirements for this section vary
   depending what actions are required of the IANA. see RFC4181 section
   3.5 for more information on writing an IANA clause for a MIB module
   document.

   [TODO] select an option and provide the necessary details.

   Option #1:


        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------

        sampleMIB  { mib-2 XXX }

   Option #2:

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.

   Note well: prior to official assignment by the IANA, a draft document
   MUST use place holders (such as "XXX" above) rather than actual
   numbers.  See RFC4181 Section 4.5 for an example of how this is done
   in a draft MIB module.

   Option #3:

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

Appendix A.  Change Log

   This section identifies the cahnges made during the development of
   this MIB.

   Here we list the changes made in developing
   draft-cole-manet-olsr-mib-01.

   1.  Completely reworked the entire Configuration Objects group in
       order to align with the newly developed NHDP-MIB draft.

Appendix B.  Open Issues

   This section contains the set of open issues related to the
   development and design of the OLSRv2-MIB.  This section will not be
   present in the final version of the MIB and will be removed once all
   the open issues have been resolved.

   1.   Look into possible redundancy between the TIB Routing Set and
        the latest standard MIB forwarding table.

   2.   Fill out the performance objects group.

   3.   Complete notification group.

   4.   Complete conformance group.

   5.   Work on the relationship to other MIBs, IF-MIB, NHDP-MIB.

   6.   Identify all objects requiring non-volatile storage in their
        DESCRIPTION clauses.

   7.   Incorporate parameter relationship conditions into their
        DESCRIPTION clauses.

   8.   Also, specify specific SNMP response to the snmp set request,
        i.e., 'generic error', 'bad value', etc.

   9.   Fill in all of the DEFVAL within the configuration group
        objects.

   10.  Run through the MIB checker.

   11.  Complete the security analysis and section.

   12.  Clean up all of the 'Note:' statements within the body of the
        MIB.
