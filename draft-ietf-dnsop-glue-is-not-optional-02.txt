             Glue In DNS Referral Responses Is Not Optional
                draft-ietf-dnsop-glue-is-not-optional-02

Abstract

   The DNS uses glue records to allow iterative clients to find the
   addresses of nameservers that are contained within a delegated zone.
   Authoritative Servers are expected to return all available glue
   records in referrals.  If message size constraints prevent the
   inclusion of all glue records in a UDP response, the server MUST set
   the TC flag to inform the client that the response is incomplete, and
   that the client SHOULD use TCP to retrieve the full response.

1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS) [RFC1034], [RFC1035] uses glue records
   to allow iterative clients to find the addresses of nameservers that
   are contained within a delegated zone.  Glue records are added to the
   parent zone as part of the delegation process and returned in
   referral responses, otherwise a resolver following the referral has
   no way of finding these addresses.  Authoritative servers are
   expected to return all available glue records in referrals.  If
   message size constraints prevent the inclusion of all glue records in
   a UDP response, the server MUST set the TC (Truncated) flag to inform
   the client that the response is incomplete, and that the client
   SHOULD use TCP to retrieve the full response.  This document
   clarifies that expectation.

   DNS responses sometimes contain optional data in the additional
   section.  Glue records however are not optional.  Several other
   protocol extensions, when used, are also not optional.  This includes
   TSIG [RFC2845], OPT [RFC6891], and SIG(0) [RFC2931].

Internet-Draft  Glue In DNS Referral Responses Is Not Op       July 2021


1.1.  Reserved Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Glue record example

   The following is a simple example of glue records present in the
   delegating zone "test" for the child zone "foo.test".  The
   nameservers for foo.test (ns1.foo.test and ns2.foo.test) are both
   below the delegation point.  They are configured as glue records in
   the "test" zone:

         foo.test.                  86400   IN NS      ns1.foo.test.
         foo.test.                  86400   IN NS      ns2.foo.test.
         ns1.foo.test.              86400   IN A       192.0.1.1
         ns2.foo.test.              86400   IN A       192.0.1.2

   Referral responses from "test" for "foo.test" must include the glue
   records in the additional section (and set TC=1 if they do not fit):

      ;; QUESTION SECTION:
      ;www.foo.test.       IN      A

      ;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
      foo.test.               86400        IN      NS      ns1.foo.test.
      foo.test.               86400        IN      NS      ns2.foo.test.

      ;; ADDITIONAL SECTION:
      ns1.foo.test.           86400        IN      A       192.0.1.1
      ns2.foo.test.           86400        IN      A       192.0.1.2

2.1.  Missing glue

   While not common, real life examples of servers that fail to set TC=1
   when glue records are available, exist and they do cause resolution
   failures.

   The example below from June 2020 shows a case where none of the glue
   records, present in the zone, fitted into the available space and
   TC=1 was not set in the response.  While this example shows an DNSSEC
   [RFC4033], [RFC4034], [RFC4035] referral response, this behaviour has
   also been seen with plain DNS responses as well.  The records have
   been truncated for display purposes.  Note that at the time of this
   writing, this configuration has been corrected and the response
   correctly sets the TC=1 flag.

4.  Sibling Glue

   Sibling glue are glue records that are not contained in the delegated
   zone itself, but in another delegated zone from the same parent.  In
   many cases, these are not strictly required for resolution, since the
   resolver can make follow-on queries to the same zone to resolve the
   nameserver addresses after following the referral to the sibling
   zone.  However, most nameserver implementations today provide them as
   an optimization to obviate the need for extra traffic from iterative
   resolvers.

   This document clarifies that sibling glue (being part of all
   available glue records) MUST be returned in referral responses, and
   that the requirement to set TC=1 applies to sibling glue that cannot
   fit in the response too.

4.1.  Sibling Glue example

   Here the delegating zone "test" contains 2 sub-delegations for the
   subzones "bar.test" and "foo.test".

         bar.test.                  86400   IN NS      ns1.bar.test.
         bar.test.                  86400   IN NS      ns2.bar.test.
         ns1.bar.test.              86400   IN A       192.0.1.1
         ns2.bar.test.              86400   IN A       192.0.1.2

         foo.test.                  86400   IN NS      ns1.bar.test.
         foo.test.                  86400   IN NS      ns2.bar.test.

   Referral responses from "test" for "foo.test" must include the
   sibling glue (and set TC=1 if they do not fit):

      ;; QUESTION SECTION:
      ;www.foo.test.       IN      A

      ;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
      foo.test.               86400        IN      NS      ns1.bar.test.
      foo.test.               86400        IN      NS      ns2.bar.test.

      ;; ADDITIONAL SECTION:
      ns1.bar.test.           86400        IN      A       192.0.1.1
      ns2.bar.test.           86400        IN      A       192.0.1.2

5.  Promoted (or orphaned) glue

   When a zone is deleted but the parent notices that its NS glue
   records are required for other zones, it MAY opt to take these (now
   orphaned) glue records into its own zone to ensure that other zones
   depending on this glue are not broken.  Technically, these address
   records are no longer glue records, but authoritative data of the
   parent zone, and should be added to the DNS response similarly to
   regular glue records.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document clarifies correct DNS server behaviour and does not
   introduce any changes or new security considerations.

7.  IANA Considerations

   There are no actions for IANA.
