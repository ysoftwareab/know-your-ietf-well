Abstract


   This  document defines the use of Service Location Protocol version 2
   (SLPv2), by Fibre Channel over TCP/IP (FCIP) Entities.


1.  Introduction


   This document describes the use of Service Location Protocol  version
   2  to  perform  dynamic discovery of participating Fibre Channel over
   TCP/IP (FCIP)  Entities.   Implementation  guidelines,  service  type
   templates, and security considerations are specified.

2.  Notation Conventions


   The  key  words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in  this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].



3.  Terminology


   Here  are  some  definitions that may aid readers that are unfamiliar
   with either SLP, or  FCIP.   Some  of  these  definitions  have  been
   reproduced from [RFC2608] and [RFC3105].


   User Agent (UA)            A  process  working on the client's behalf
                              to establish contact  with  some  service.
                              The  UA retrieves service information from
                              the Service Agents or Directory Agents.


   Service Agent (SA)         A process working on behalf of one or more
                              services  to  advertise  the  services and
                              their capabilites.


   Directory Agent (DA)       A   process   which    collects    service
                              advertisements.   There can only be one DA
                              present per given host.


   Scope                      A named set of services, typically  making
                              up a logical administrative group.


   Service Advertisement      A   URL,   attributes,   and   a  lifetime
                              (indicating how long the advertisement  is
                              valid),     providing    service    access
                              information and  capabilities  description
                              for a particular service.


   FCIP Entity                The  principle FCIP interface point to the
                              IP network.


   FCIP Entity Name           The world wide name of the switch  if  the
                              FCIP  Entity  resides  in  a switch or the
                              world wide node  name  of  the  associated
                              Nx_Port.


   FCIP Discovery Domain      The  FCIP Discovery Domain specifies which
                              FCIP Entities are allowed to discover each
                              other within the bounds of the scope.

4.  Using SLPv2 for FCIP Service Discovery


   At  least  two FCIP Entities must be involved in the entity discovery
   process.  The end result is that an FCIP Entity will discover one  or
   more peer FCIP Entities.

   The  following  diagram  shows the relationship between FCIP Entities
   and their associated SLPv2 agents.

   Fig. 1 FCIP Entity and SLPv2 Agent Relationship.


   As indicated in the drawing above, each FCIP Entity contains an  FCIP
   Control and Services Module that interfaces to an SLPv2 SA and UA.


   The   SA   constructs   a   service   advertisement   of   the   type




Peterson                     Standards Track                    [Page 3]



Internet-Draft     Finding FCIP Entities Using SLPv2        January 2004



   "service:fcip:entity" for each of  the  service  URLs  it  wishes  to
   register.  The  service advertisement contains a lifetime, along with
   other attributes defined in the service template.


   The remainder of the discovery process is identical to that  used  by
   any client/server pair implementing SLPv2:


   1.  If  an  SLPv2  DA  is found [RFC2608], the SA contacts the DA and
   registers the service advertisement. Whether or not one or more SLPv2
   DAs are discovered, the SA maintains the service advertisement itself
   and answers multicast UA queries directly.


   2. When the FCIP Entity requires contact information for a peer  FCIP
   Entity,  the  UA either contacts the DA using unicast or the SA using
   multicast using an SLPv2 service request.   The  UA  service  request
   includes   a   query,  based  on  the  attributes,  to  indicate  the
   characteristics of the peer FCIP Entities it requires.


   3. Once the UA has the IP address and port  number  of  a  peer  FCIP
   Entity, it may begin the normal connection procedure, as described in
   [FCIP], to a peer FCIP Entity.


   The use of a DA  is  RECOMMENDED  for  SLPv2  operation  in  an  FCIP
   environment.



4.1.1.  FCIP Discovery Domains


   The  concept  of  a  discovery domain provides further granularity of
   control of allowed discovery between FCIP Entities within a  specific
   SLPv2 scope.


   The  following  example  diagram  shows the relationship between FCIP
   Entities and their associated discovery domains  within  a  specified
   SLPv2 scope.

   Fig. 2 FCIP Entity and Discovery Domain Example.


   Within  the  specified  scope "fcip", the administrator has defined a
   discovery domain "purple", allowing FCIP Entities  A,  B,  and  C  to
   discover  each other.  This discovery domain is illustrated using the
   "*" character.


   Within the specified scope "fcip", the administrator  has  defined  a
   discovery  domain  "orange",  allowing FCIP Entity A to discover FCIP
   Entity  B,  but  not  FCIP  Entity  C.   This  discovery  domain   is
   illustrated using the "#" character.


   Within  the  specified  scope "fcip", the administrator has defined a
   discovery domain "blue", allowing FCIP  Entity  C  to  discover  FCIP
   Entity   B,  but  not  FCIP  Entity  A.   This  discovery  domain  is
   illustrated using the "/" character.


   For this example, the value of  the  fcip-discovery-domain  attribute
   for each FCIP Entity is as follows:


   FCIP Entity A = orange,purple


   FCIP Entity B = orange,blue,purple


   FCIP Entity C = blue,purple

4.2.  NAT and NAPT Considerations


   Since  SLPv2  provides IP address and TCP port information within its
   payload, the addresses an SA or DA advertise may not be the  same  as
   those   a  UA  must  use  if  a  Network  Address(/Port)  Translation
   (NAT/NAPT) device is present between the UA  and  the  SA.  This  may
   result  in  the  UA discovering address information that is unusable.
   Also note that SLP advertisements that occur inside a private address
   realm  may  be  unreachable  outside  that  realm.   Below  are  some
   recommendations for dealing with SLPv2 and NAT/NAPT devices:


   - A fully-qualified domain name (i.e., not an IP address)  SHOULD  be
     used in service URLs and the mgmt-entity attribute [RFC1900].


   - Configure  the  NAPT  device  to provide default mapping(s) for the
     well-known port(s) and use the default IANA-assigned FCIP TCP  port
     number in service URLs, when possible.



5.  FCIP SLPv2 Templates


   Two  templates are provided: an FCIP Entity template, and an abstract
   template to provide a means to add other FCIP  related  templates  in
   the future.



5.1.  The FCIP Abstract Service Type Template


   This template defines the abstract service "service:fcip". It is used
   as  a  top-level  service  to  encapsulate  all  other  FCIP  related
   services.

   --------------------------template ends here------------------------



5.2.  The FCIP Entity Concrete Service Type Template


   This  template  defines  the  service "service:fcip:entity". A device
   containing FCIP Entities that wishes  to  have  them  discovered  via
   SLPv2  would  register each of them, with each of their addresses, as
   this service type.


   FCIP Entities wishing to discover other FCIP Entities in this  manner
   will generally use one of the following example query strings:


   1. Find a specific FCIP Entity, given its FCIP Entity Name:


     Service:  service:fcip:entity
     Scope:    fcip-entity-scope-list
     Query:    (fcip-entity-name=\ff\10\00\00\60\69\20\34\0C)


   2. Find all of the FCIP Entities within a
      specified FCIP Discovery Domain:


     Service:  service:fcip:entity
     Scope:    fcip-entity-scope-list
     Query:    (fcip-discovery-domain=fcip-discovery-domain-name)


   3. In addition, a management application may wish to discover
      all FCIP Entities:


     Service:  service:fcip:entity
     Scope:    management-service-scope-list
     Query:    none

     by others. UAs will generally search for these by including one of
     the following:
     - the FCIP Entity Name for which an address is needed
     - the FCIP Discovery Domain Name for which addresses are requested
     - the service URL

6.  Security Considerations


   The  SLPv2  security model as specified in [RFC2608] does not provide
   confidentiality, but does provide an authentication mechanism for UAs
   to assure that service advertisements only come from trusted SAs with
   the exception that it does not provide a  mechanism  to  authenticate
   "zero-result  responses". See [IPS-SEC] for a discussion of the SLPv2
   [RFC2608] security model.


   Once an FCIP Entity is discovered, authentication  and  authorization
   are  handled  by  the  FCIP protocol. It is the responsibility of the
   providers  of  these  services  to  ensure  that  an  inappropriately
   advertised  or discovered service does not comprimise their security.


   When no security is used for SLPv2, there is a risk  of  distribution
   of  false  discovery information. The primary countermeasure for this
   risk is authentication. When this  risk  is  a  significant  concern,
   IPsec  SAs  SHOULD  be  used for FCIP traffic subject to this risk to
   ensure that FCIP traffic  only  flows  between  endpoints  that  have
   participated  in  IKE  authentication.  For  example,  if an attacker
   distributes discovery information falsely claiming that it is an FCIP
   endpoint,   it   will   lack  the  secret  information  necessary  to
   successfully complete IKE authentication, and hence will be prevented
   from falsely sending or receiving FCIP traffic.


   There  remains a risk of a denial of service attack based on repeated
   use of false discovery information that will cause initiation of  IKE
   negotiation.   The   countermeasures   for  this  are  administrative
   configuration of each FCIP Entity to  limit  the  peers  that  it  is
   willing  to  communicate  with  (i.e., by IP address range and/or DNS
   domain), and maintenance of a negative authentication cache to  avoid
   repeatedly  contacting  an  FCIP  Entity  that fails to authenticate.
   These three measures (i.e.,  IP  address  range  limits,  DNS  domain
   limits, negative authentication cache) MUST be implemented.

Internet-Draft     Finding FCIP Entities Using SLPv2        January 2004



6.1.  Security Implementation


   Security for SLPv2 in an IP storage environment is specified in [IPS-
   SEC].


   IPsec SHOULD be implemented for SLPv2 as specified in [IPS-SEC]. This
   includes ESP with a non-null transform to provide both authentication
   and confidentiality.


   SLPv2 authentication is OPTIONAL to  implement  and  use,  and  SLPv2
   authentication SHOULD be implemented when IPsec is not supported.



7.  IANA Considerations


   After   RFC  publication,  an  SLP  designated  expert  will  oversee
   registration of the template(s) in the IANA repository.



8.  Internationalization Considerations


   SLP allows internationalized strings to be registered and  retrieved.
   Attributes  in the template that are not marked with an 'L' (literal)
   will  be  registered  in  a  localized  manner.  An  "en"   (English)
   localization MUST be registered, and others MAY be registered.


9.  Summary


   This  document  describes  how  SLPv2 can be used by FCIP Entities to
   find other FCIP Entities. Service type templates  for  FCIP  Entities
   are presented.
