1. INTRODUCTION

In personal communication systems, providing mobility between dissimilar
(e.g. fast indoor and slower outdoor) networks is one of the most
interesting areas of research today [1,2]. This kind of inter-technology
mobility is seen as one of the central issues in the becoming fourth
generation of telecommunication networks and systems. IP is seen as the
interconnecting protocol, and various schemes for IP mobility management
has been introduced, both in micro and macro level [3,4]. Another trend
is the integration of geolocation capabilities to the existing
networks. Location services (LCS) are to be specified in the 3G [5-9]
and other networking related standardisation, also within IETF
[10-17]. These features bring added value for the industry, network
operators and mobile users. An interesting area that has not yet been
addressed is the interplay between these two: how to use geolocation
information in the inter-technology (inter-domain) mobility management.

1.1.  Scope

This document addresses those requirements for IP spatial location
protocol that emerges from the situation where mobile hosts (MH) use
location information in the inter-domain mobility management. While IP
spatial location protocol has many other usage cases, this document
focuses on the requirements for mobile IP device that needs to know the
whereabouts of IP subnetwork to be visited in order to prepare for
handoff. Three inter-technology handoff (ITHO) scenarios and the related
problems are presented, and the requirements for the system
architecture, terminal and IP spatial location protocol are
outlined. Considerations on the algorithm are given. The work is done in
association with other spatial location related studies within IETF.

2. Inter-technology Handoff Scenarios

There can be seen different business and usage scenarios around
inter-technology mobility. In the following, three scenarios and the
related problems are described. 


2.1 Moving-in (MI) Scenario

For some mobile Internet users the primary (underlay) network is the
cellular network (i.e., GPN, when GPS or some other geolocation
technology is integrated into cellular). It can be overlaid with a WLAN
or some other short-range radio network (i.e., LPN when geolocation is
enabled) in areas such as business centers, hotels, airports, etc, to
provide higher data rate service. To avoid unnecessary search of LPN
beacon mobile host (MH) must be aware of the whereabouts of the overlay
system to be visited.

Internet Draft                                              April 2000


2.2 Moving-out (MO) Scenario

LPN can be the primary (underlay) network for people who work in the
office environment. In this scenario the user has a laptop in his (or
her) office connected to the companies LPN. When he leaves his office,
he may want to maintain the network connection alive (having some
application, such as ftp or newsgroup, running). As LPN most probably
provides greater data rate with less expense than the overlaying GPN,
the user wants to maintain the LPN connection as long as possible before
switching to the overlaying GPN data service.


2.3 Moving-through (MT) Scenario

Here a fast moving MH (inside a moving vehicle) using GPN network is
assumed to drive through a LPN coverage area. This is a combination of
first two scenarios.


2.4 Related Problems

Problems for MI scenario:

1) What kind of system architecture is needed to inform MH that it is
approaching LPN or MH can make queries of nearest LPNs? 
2) What are the requirements for IP spatial location protocol (ISL)in
proportion to  
   a) terminal velocity
   b) geolocation accuracy
   c) coordinate information updating frequency 
   d) the time required for execution of inter-working and other related
      mobility management functions?
3) How is the terminal velocity concluded/acquired and indicated?
4) How is the geolocation accuracy indicated?
5) What is the structure of IP spatial location protocol that would take
   into consideration the requirements that emerge from ITHO mobility
   management usage scenarios?

Problems for MO scenario:

6) How can MH exploit the LPN connection as far as possible in a
   seamless manner taking into consideration
   a) the different application types (real-time and non-real-time) 
   b) time-varying radio channel (RSS)?
   c) other possible parameters to improve handoff performance?

Problems for MT scenario:

7) What are the requirements for the LPN coverage area size in 
   proportion to 
   a) terminal velocity
   b) the amount of data to be transmitted during the visit to LPN? 

Ylianttila        <draft-ylianttila-isl-prot-req-00.txt>      [Page 4]
Internet Draft                                              April 2000


With these defined three scenarios, there are many similar problems, as
addressed in the context of MI scenario. However, terminal path and
velocity can be different, as well as the channel model. For example, in
MI and MO scenarios, we can think about a pedestrian coming and leaving
his office environment. This means a handoff between indoor and outdoor
radio channel. It also means a handoff between indoor and outdoor
geolocation methods. In MT scenario, we can think about car driving
through a LPN coverage area, from which MH can download a large data
file, which would take much longer to download by using cellular data
connection.


3. Requirements for the System Architecture

3.1 Geolocation Data Source

In the future there will be multiple ways to provide geolocation
information for MH. Both cellular and WLAN networks will eventually have
geolocation capabilities. GPS or some other geolocation technology can be
integrated with cellular terminals. On the other hand, broadband
short-range radio systems such as WLANs will very likely support
geolocation in the future (also indoors, where GPS does not work). In this
document we refer these systems as Global Positioning Network (GPN) and
Local Positioning Network (LPN) respectively. Within these networks, there
should be a way for MH to choose the best (most accurate) geolocation data
source as well as the best networking technology (highest data rate)
available in a seamless manner for the mobile user.


3.2 Secure Coordinate Server

MH can either allow or deny the routing of its location information to the
distributed geolocation coordinate servers. Due to the fact that the
transport and access to location information must be strictly
authenticated and otherwise secured, these network nodes are referred in
this document as Secure Coordinate Servers (SCS). It can also be referred
as IP Spatial Location Server or whatever name is decided to be used. Here
we just assume that this node exists and communication between it and MH
can be established in a secure manner. A specific protocol to establish
and deliver the geolocation coordinates, such as IP spatial location
protocol can be used. Details of these are addressed in other spatial
location related Internet drafts [10-17].


3.3 Terminal Velocity and Updating Frequency 

Terminal velocity can be also used as a metric for the ITHO algorithm
and application development. It can be calculated from two consecutive
coordinate measurements. If the updating frequency of the coordinate
information is f, and the distance between two measurement points (x1
and x2) is s, then terminal velocity is simply: 

Ylianttila        <draft-ylianttila-isl-prot-req-00.txt>      [Page 5]
Internet Draft                                              April 2000


     v = f*s                               (1)
 
Consequently, the updating frequency is

     f = v/s                               (2)


3.4 Geolocation Accuracy

Estimate of the current location of MH is effected by the geolocation
accuracy E of the used technology. We can approximate that MH is moving
To horizontal direction and Ex = E. Thus, distance between measurement
points observed by MH is

     s = x2 - x1 +- 2E                      (3)

By combining (2) and (3), we get a requirement for updating frequency as
a function of terminal velocity and geolocation accuracy:

     f = v/(x2 - x1 +- 2E)                  (4)

If some form of velocity vector will be specified (including the speed
and direction of movement), it could be calculated from two consecutive
location coordinates s= x2 - x1, and v=s/t (t= updating frequency). This
estimate would be effected by the geolocation error, s = x2 - x1 +- 2E,
where E is the maximum geolocation error. The following figure
illustrates the worst case situation (in horizontal axis)


                 +<- E ->+<-   s   ->+<- E ->+
                 x1'     x1         x2      x2'        

     Figure1. Worst case situation in velocity measurement 


In measurement point x1, due to the geolocation error, system would say
that the terminal is in x1', and in x2 in x2', respectively. Thus the
maximum error for this measurement would be 2E. Parameter E is different
for different location systems. Thus, the accuracy field could indicate
some specied class of accuracy. Application could then decide based on
that whether it can use the current source of coordinate information for
some specific actions. There can of course be some other ways to
conclude terminal velocity.

As a numerical example, if we assume f = 1/s (as in GPS), v = 1 m/s
(pedestrian) and E = 0,1 m (DGPS), then x2 - x1 = 1 +- 0,2 m. 
Similarly, if v = 30 m/s (car driving), then x2 - x1 = 30 +- 0,2 m. We
can conclude that when v is high, then the proportional effect of E to
the measured geolocation is less, and vice versa. MH may extrapolate (if
needed) the terminal path between consecutive measurements to give a
more accurate estimate of the current location between two points of
measurements.

3.5 Inter-Working Functions

As all traffic is here assumed to be IP based, micro- and macromobility
schemes addressed in the Mobile IP working group can be utilized. The
terminal algorithm can be used in the terminal to monitor the network
resources, and then trigger IWF functions when needed. The study of the
performance of IWF schemes when geolocation information is used is an
interesting topic, but is out of the scope of this document.


3.6 MI Scenario Requirements

During and before the time that MH is visiting the LPN, it should
associate itself with LPN, trigger the needed IWF and ITHO algorithms
and execute the requested data transfer actions. For mobility management
in MI scenario, geolocation information can be obtained from GPN and
used in the following way. Some of the issues mentioned here are also
relevant for the two other scenarios.


3.6.1 Checking resolution of LPN beacon

The resolution of checking must be determined so that the battery
of the MH will not be consumed unnecessarily when the MH is far away 
from the LPN. Therefore, different levels of checking resolution may be 
used within different distances from the LPN coverage area edge, also
depending on the terminal velocity vector (speed/direction). 


3.6.2 Transition Time

Transition time t(itho) is the time needed to bring up the interface,
associate with LPN system, trigger and perform the inter-working
functions (IWF) such as Mobile IP registration procedure. It also
includes the possible additional network delay caused by e.g. traffic
congestion. It begins when the first burst of LPN beacon is received in
MH. It ends when MH is associated with LPN and the first bytes of data
are sent through LPN. When MH leaves LPN, there is a similar but reverse
order procedure: de-association from LPN, association to GPN,
etc. [1,2].  


3.6.3 Transition Region

Transition region Dtr is the distance what MH moves during t(itho).  If 
we assume that MH is moving with constant velocity v (m/s), then

     Dtr = v*t(itho)                       (5)

The total delay budget of t(itho) must be taken into consideration in
system design, e.g. when dimensioning the LPN coverage for fast moving
hosts (MT scenario).

Internet Draft                                              April 2000


3.6.4 Initiation Distance

To allow MH to prepare for ITHO, MH must get a message from SCS that it
is approaching the LPN hot spot area. It should prepare to ITHO and to
trigger ITHO procedure exactly when it gets the first bursts of the
transmission channel. Due to the geolocation error, MH has to start
active scanning in point D (initiation distance from the edge of LPN
coverage area). For D, there is a requirement: 

     D >= Dtr(max) + E(max)               (6)

where Dtr(max) is the maximum value of expected transition region
(5) and E(max) is the maximum of estimated geolocation error in
GPN. Only when this requirement is met, the geolocation information
becomes handy beyond statistical variance and allows MH to prepare for
ITHO in all circumstances.


3.7 MO Scenario Requirements

Here we assume that both GPN and LPN interfaces are activated. In case
MH stays a long time in LPN, then GPN interface can be deactivated and
reactivated similar to MI scenario. For mobility management in MO
scenario (from LPN to GPN), geolocation information can be used in
either of the following ways.


3.7.1 Straight-forward Approach

A simplistic approach for MO scenario is to just employ RSS in the
algorithm. When RSS goes below the defined value, the algorithm triggers
ITHO algorithm to switch from LPN to GPN. This way, however, the range
of LPN may not be fully utilised. For a non-real-time application, such
as ftp, it would be preferable to stay in LPN as far as possible,
through the whole transition region till no data goes through LPN
connection. This may cause a serious gap to real-time traffic. But
non-real-time application will gain about this by getting more data
through LPN that it would have got through GPN during the same time
interval (we can think LPN to have at least 2 Mbit/s and GPN about 56
kbit/s data rates).


3.7.2 Multiple-metric Approach

In this approach, Geolocation Coordinate Information (GCI) or any number
of other valid metrics can be given as input for a multiple-metric ITHO
algorithm. This way LPN range may be utilized in seamless manner. ITHO
should take place in early enough location, where the handoff delay will
not cut off real-time traffic (especially when adequate buffering is
used). 


Ylianttila        <draft-ylianttila-isl-prot-req-00.txt>      [Page 8]
Internet Draft                                              April 2000

   
3.7.3 Statistical Approach  

Ideal system would use the geolocation history and other information to
adapt itself to perform the best possible manner in the specific
environment. Statistics of the locations and related RSS values when
ITHO takes place could be collected to SCS. MH could store the
coordinates where ITHO handoff last occurred to SCS together with
related link specific values such as RSS and SNR. For the algorithm
input, MH can acquire GCI from SCS databases that hold the information
of location and dynamic range of LPN.


3.8 MT Scenario Requirements

In MT, which is a combination of MI and MO scenarios, the requirements
presented for them apply also here. In addition to them, based on the
terminal velocity and LPN network traffic status, the system could
inform how much data (B) can be transmitted during driving through LPN
(throughput h). Trivially,

     t =(B/h)                           (7)                    

and if the radius of LPN is r, then

     v =(2r/t)                          (8)                 
       			
and from this we can easily calculate the maximum amount of data that
can be transmitted (B):

     B <= 2rh/v                          (9)		

If r is know by the system (SCS), it could suggest for example to slow
down to certain velocity v in order to have time t to download a
specific requested large data file of size B (such as audio or video
file). 


4. Terminal Requirements 

Many requirements for the terminal have been already given in the
context of the requirements for system architecture. Naturally, MH must
have interfaces to both GPN and LPN networks, thus making it dual-mode
(or multiple-mode). It should support IP based traffic (also IPv6),
security and adequate QoS policies for variety of applications. There
may be several types of terminals with different requirements, but that
is out the scope of this document. For the mobility management part,
complexity of mobility and network management must be transparent to the
user as far as possible, hence making the use of mobile terminals 
flexible and convenient. User may configure if he denies or allows


Ylianttila        <draft-ylianttila-isl-prot-req-00.txt>      [Page 9]
Internet Draft                                              April 2000


forwarding of his location data to SCS for some other purpose than
inter-technology mobility management. In the following some
considerations on the ITHO algorithm are given.


4.1 Algorithm Inputs 

As mentioned earlier, GCI can be given as an input to a multiple-metric
ITHO algorithm together with other valid metrics. For our ITHO algorithm
we consider three input parameters: Received Signal Strength (RSS), CGI,
MH Velocity (MHV). As an additional parameter, Real-time factor
(RTF) could be used to indicate the realtimeness of the transmitted
data. Terminal may utilize either one or more of these inputs to be used
in the algorithm, as was described in section 3.7.


4.2 Algorithm Outputs

ITHO algorithm can give one or more action outputs. The output can
either be a direct command to perform the handoff, or indicate the state
of the system in order to make additional arrangements for the mobility
management. As an example, we can consider ITHO algorithm for MO
scenario, giving one of the three possible action outputs: A, B and
C.  For a MH working in LPN underlay the output A (Rest) indicates that
the link quality of the LPN is satisfactory and there is no handoff
imminent. Output B (Alert) indicates that there is an increased
possibility of handoff in the near future and gives the system a chance
to prepare for a handoff procedure. The C (Handoff) output indicates
that a handoff is needed and the handoff procedure to the GPN is
invoked. Similar approach can be applied to other scenarios as well.


4.3 Example Algorithm

As an example, fuzzy logic algorithm can be used to handle multiple metric
decision. There are also other alternatives, as mentioned in [18]. Fuzzy
logic system contains four main parts: Fuzzyfier, Rule base, Inference
Engine and Defuzzyfier. Engine maps the fuzzyfied input by if-then
reasoning process to the fuzzy output variable, which is then
defuzzyfied to form a crisp output value. 

Table 1. Rule base for ITHO algorithm based on fuzzy logic.

      Rule   If       And      And     Then
      No.    RSS      MHV      GCI     ITHO 
      1      Weak     Slow     Far     Rest
      2      Medium   Medium   Far     Rest
      3      Strong   Fast     Far     Alert
      4      Weak     Slow     Close   Alert
      5      Medium   Medium   Close   Handoff
      6      Strong   Fast     Close   Handoff


Ylianttila        <draft-ylianttila-isl-prot-req-00.txt>      [Page 10]
Internet Draft                                              April 2000


Example of the Rule base for ITHO can be seen on Table 1. Only six of
total 27 different combinations are presented. When we elaborate for
example rule 1, we see that if the RSS from the LPN is weak and MHV is
slow and GCI indicates that MH is far from the LPN, then ITHO is in a
rest state. That indicates that there is no handoff imminent and the
battery power should not be wasted for unnecessary search. Fuzzy
concepts such as weak, low, far are defined by membership functions. For
example triangular and trapezoidal membership functions can be used to
tailor for the RSS fuzzy concepts weak, medium and strong to match to
the geometry of the environment.


5. Requirements for the IP spatial Location Protocol

The problem statement in Spatial Location BOF in Adelaine 47th IETF was
defined as: "Secure and Reliable Exchange of Location Information
between IP devices". In this, however, the focus should merely be in
exchance of location information rather than in the security issues,
although security MUST be build into the system. 

Our suggestion is that IP spatial location protocol MUST be application
layer protocol. Then, location information is just data in certain
format that will be delivered in secure manner. We can then use strong
encryption in the application layer, and other security mechanisms in
the underlaying layers. We do not see any additional security
requirements for location data than any other important data. We may
only want to define the level of security needed, e.g., encryption key
lenght. This level may be different for different applications that
utilise location information.

One requirement that should be included in the IP spatial location
protocol is some sort of QoS field for different types of coordinate
flows. Some, such as for some Virtual Reality applications, may require
constant bit rate, where some other applications do not have such
requirements. QoS field would help to differentiate these different
flows and mapping to the underlaying protocols would be easy. 

As a conlusion, based on the discussion in
ext-ip-location@research.nokia.com mailing list and ideas presented in
[10-17], IP spatial location protocol should contain the following
fields:

- Location of the device (format to be decided)
- Time stamp (can be used to determine the validity of the coordinate
  information, whether it is "out of date" or not)
- Updating frequency (terminal can request certain rate)
- Security classification field (different classes of security)
- QoS field (e.g. based on ATM QoS classes)
- Accuracy field (i.e. class of estimated/expected maximum error)

The work to identify the details of the protocol will continue in the
framework of Spatial Location activities within IETF.
