Internet Draft           Fibre Channel RSCN MIB             October 2006


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects for information related
   to Registered State Change Notifications (RSCNs) [FC-LS] in a Fibre
   Channel network, including which Nx_Ports are registered to receive
   which types of RSCNs, the control and generation of SNMP
   notifications on registration failures, and RSCN-related statistics.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


3.  Short Overview of Fibre Channel

   The Fibre Channel (FC) is logically a bidirectional point-to-point
   serial data channel, structured for high performance.  Fibre Channel
   provides a general transport vehicle for higher level protocols such
   as Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-
   Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet
   Protocol), IEEE 802.2, and others.

   Physically, Fibre Channel is an interconnection of multiple
   communication points, called N_Ports, interconnected either by a
   switching network, called a Fabric, or by a point-to-point link.  A

Internet Draft           Fibre Channel RSCN MIB             October 2006


   Fibre Channel "node" consists of one or more N_Ports.  A Fabric may
   consist of multiple Interconnect Elements, some of which are
   switches.  An N_Port connects to the Fabric via a port on a switch
   called an F_Port.  When multiple FC nodes are connected to a single
   port on a switch via an "Arbitrated Loop" topology, the switch port
   is called an FL_Port, and the nodes' ports are called NL_Ports.  The
   term Nx_Port is used to refer to either an N_Port or an NL_Port.  The
   term Fx_Port is used to refer to either an F_Port or an FL_Port.  A
   switch port, which is interconnected to another switch port via an
   Inter Element Link (IEL), is called an E_Port.  A B_Port connects a
   bridge device with an E_Port on a switch; a B_Port provides a subset
   of E_Port functionality.

   Many Fibre Channel components, including the fabric, each node, and
   most ports, have globally-unique names.  These globally-unique names
   are typically formatted as World Wide Names (WWNs).  More information
   on WWNs can be found in [FC-FS].  WWNs are expected to be persistent
   across agent and unit resets.

   Fibre Channel frames contain 24-bit address identifiers which
   identify the frame's source and destination ports.  Each FC port has
   both an address identifier and a WWN.  When a fabric is in use, the
   FC address identifiers are dynamically assigned by a switch.  Each
   octet of a 24-bit address represents a level in an address hierarchy,
   with a Domain_ID being the highest level of the hierarchy.

   Registered State Change Notifications (RSCNs) are defined in [FC-LS]
   as a means to provide Nx_Ports which have registered to receive such
   notifications, with a timely indication of changes in the state of
   nodes attached to the fabric.  Specifically, an Nx_Port may choose to
   register, using an State Change Registration (SCR) request [FC-LS] to
   receive RSCNs.  A Nx_Port which has registered will receive an RSCN
   when an event occurs which may affect the registered port's state.
   For example, an Nx_Port can use RSCNs as the means by which it is
   informed of the failures of other nodes, of new devices coming
   online, or even of more network-accessible storage becoming
   available.  The payload of the RSCN indicates the type of change and
   includes the address of the changed port.  RSCNs are often generated
   by the fabric, but an Nx_Port can also generate (and send to the
   fabric) an RSCN if and when it detects an event not visible to the
   fabric.  The sender of an RSCN may coalesce several events into a
   single RSCN message.  Each RSCN is a "request" which is acknowledged
   by the receiver with an accept or reject.

   An RSCN is received by an Nx_Port from the Fabric as an Extended Link

   Service (ELS) request [FC-LS].  The Fabric distributes RSCNs between
   Switches using an SW_ILS frame with an Inter-Switch RSCN payload,
   also known as an SW_RSCN [FC-SW-4].  So, when a Switch has directly
   attached Nx_Ports which have registered to receive RSCNs, it converts
   received SW_RSCNs (i.e., SW_ILS frames containing SW_RSCN payloads)
   into ELS requests containing the corresponding RSCN which it sends to
   each such Nx_Port.

   The latest standard for an interconnecting Fabric containing multiple
   Fabric Switch elements is [FC-SW-4].  [FC-SW-4] carries forward the
   earlier specification for the operation of a single Fabric in a
   physical infrastructure, and augments it with the definition of
   Virtual Fabrics and with the specification of how multiple Virtual
   Fabrics can operate within one (or more) physical infrastructures.
   The use of Virtual Fabrics provides for each frame to be tagged in
   its header to indicate which one of several Virtual Fabrics that
   frame is being transmitted on.  All frames entering a particular
   "Core Switch" [FC-SW-4] (i.e., a physical switch) on the same Virtual
   Fabric are processed by the same "Virtual Switch" within that Core
   switch.


4.  Relationship to Other MIBs

   The first standardized MIB for Fibre Channel [RFC2837] was focused on
   Fibre Channel switches.  It was replaced by the more generic Fibre
   Channel Management MIB [RFC4044] which defines basic information for
   Fibre Channel hosts and switches, including extensions to the
   standard IF-MIB [IF-MIB] for Fibre Channel interfaces.  [RFC4044]
   includes the specification of how the generic objects defined in [IF-
   MIB] apply to Fibre Channel interfaces.

   This MIB imports some common Textual Conventions defined in the
   T11-TC-MIB [RFC4439] and in the T11-FC-NAME-SERVER-MIB [RFC4438].

5.  MIB Overview

   This section explains the use of a Fibre Channel management instance,
   a Switch Index, and a Fabric Index.  It also describes the four MIB
   groups contained in the MIB.

5.1.  Fibre Channel management instance

   A Fibre Channel management instance is defined in [RFC4044] as a
   separable managed instance of Fibre Channel functionality.  Fibre
   Channel functionality may be grouped into Fibre Channel management
   instances in whatever way is most convenient for the
   implementation(s).  For example, one such grouping accommodates a
   single SNMP agent having multiple AgentX [RFC2741] sub-agents, with
   each sub-agent implementing a different Fibre Channel management
   instance.

   The object, fcmInstanceIndex, is IMPORTed from the FC-MGMT-MIB
   [RFC4044] as the index value to uniquely identify each Fibre Channel
   management instance, for example within the same SNMP context
   ([RFC3411] section 3.3.1).

5.2.  Switch Index

   The FC-MGMT-MIB [RFC4044] defines the fcmSwitchTable as a table of
   information about Fibre Channel switches which are managed by Fibre
   Channel management instances.  Each Fibre Channel management instance
   can manage one or more Fibre Channel switches.  The Switch Index,
   fcmSwitchIndex, is IMPORTed from the FC-MGMT-MIB as the index value
   to uniquely identify a Fibre Channel switch amongst those (one or
   more) managed by the same Fibre Channel management instance.

5.3.  Fabric Index

   Whether operating on a physical Fabric (i.e., without Virtual
   Fabrics) or within a Virtual Fabric, the manner of operation of RSCNs
   within a/each Fabric is identical.  Therefore, this MIB defines all
   Fabric-related information in tables which are INDEX-ed by an
   arbitrary integer, named a "Fabric Index", the syntax of which is
   IMPORTed from the T11-TC-MIB [RFC4439].  When a device is connected
   to a single physical Fabric, without use of any virtual Fabrics, the
   value of this Fabric Index will always be 1.  In an environment of
   multiple virtual and/or physical Fabrics, this index provides a means
   to distinguish one Fabric from another.

Internet Draft           Fibre Channel RSCN MIB             October 2006


   It is quite possible, and may even be likely, that a Fibre Channel
   switch will have ports connected to multiple virtual and/or physical
   Fabrics.  Thus, in order to simplify a management protocol query
   concerning all the Fabrics to which a single switch is connected,
   fcmSwitchIndex will be listed before t11FcRscnFabricIndex when they
   both appear in the same INDEX clause.

5.4.  The t11FcRscnRegistrationGroup group

   This group contains information about the Nx_Ports which have
   registered to receive RSCNs.

5.5.  The t11FcRscnNotifyGroup group

   This group contains two notifications: one generated by when a switch
   rejects a SCR or RSCN; the other when a switch rejects a SW_RSCN.

5.5.1.  Flow-Control for Notifications

   When defining SNMP notifications for events which occur in the data-
   plane, the maximum frequency of their generation needs to be
   considered.  Unless there is some limiting factor, such notifications
   need to be flow-controlled in some way, e.g., defined such that after
   some maximum number within a specified time interval have occurred,
   further notifications are suppressed for some subsequent time
   interval.  However, as and when such a suppression occurs, the NMS
   which didn't receive the notifications (because they were suppressed)
   needs to be able to obtain an indication of how many were suppressed.
   Therefore, an additional Counter32 object needs to be defined, and/or
   a new type of notification needs to be defined for use at the end of
   the interval.  While this is extra complexity, it is necessary for
   notifications which need to be flow-controlled.

   In contrast, for notifications such as both the ones defined in this
   MIB module, which are generated due to control plane events (and are
   not able to start a chain-reaction), the extra complexity of flow-
   controlling these types of notifications is not warranted.

5.6.  The t11FcRscnNotifyControlGroup group

   This group contains one object for each notification in the
   t11FcRscnNotifyGroup group to enable/disable that notification, as
   well as three objects which record information about the latest
   rejection of an SCR, RSCN or SW_RSCN, specifically, the content (if
   available) of the rejected request, the source of the rejected

   request, and the reason for the rejection.

5.7.  The t11FcRscnStatsGroup group

   This group contains RSCN-related statistics.  Two levels of
   statistics are included:

     1) counters at the message-type level, for:
          - the number of SCRs received/rejected,
          - the number of RSCNs sent/received/rejected,
          - the number of SW_RSCNs sent/received/rejected.

     2) counters for each different category of sent/received RSCNs,
        where different categories are indicated by different values of
        the 'Event Qualifier' contained in an RSCN message.  Note that
        if and when several RSCN events are coalesced into a single RSCN
        message, then that message may be counted in more than one of
        these counters.  No counters are defined in this MIB for the
        'Event Qualifier' value of '0001'b (meaning "Changed Name Server
        Object") because these types of RSCNs are counted by the
        t11NsInRscns and t11NsOutRscns objects already defined in
        [RFC4438].

10.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to make a MIB OID assignment for the
   T11-FC-RSCN-MIB module, under the appropriate subtree.

11.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability are:

        t11FcRscnIlsRejectNotifyEnable
        t11FcRscnElsRejectNotifyEnable
           -- ability to enable/disable a notification; these object, if
              misconfigured, would either generate unwanted notifications
              or suppress wanted notifications.


   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may also be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects
   and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending
   them over the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and
   their sensitivity/vulnerability:

        t11FcRscnRegTable -- contains a list of Nx_Ports which are
        currently registered to received RSCNs.

        t11FcRscnStatsTable -- contains RSCN-related statistics.

        t11FcRscnNotifyControlTable -- contains control and logging
        information for notifications which are concerned with the
        rejection of RSCN-related requests.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is

   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementors consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
