Abstract 
    
   This document identifies a potential SPIT and Phishing attack, which 
   subverts the RFC 4474 SIP Identity and RFC 4916 Connected Identity 
   mechanisms in a particular way.  The attack is termed "Baiting", as 
   it uses a RFC4474-signed call as the bait for malicious use.

1. Introduction 
    
   SIP Identity, defined in [RFC4474], defines a mechanism for 
   originating domains to sign SIP requests with a certificate, in 
   order to prove the legitimacy of the From identity and the request's 
   body content.  The motivation of the work derived from the need to 
   provide a form of cryptographically strong end-to-end (or end-domain 
   to end-domain) identity, in order to avoid malicious use of identity 
   fraud.   
    
   While not specifically called out, many people consider the 
   [RFC4474] mechanism as useful for preventing SPIT and Phishing 
   attacks, because strong identity is a basis for many anti-SPIT

   techniques [SIP-SPAM].  This draft describes a form of attack which 
   shows that is not the case. 
    
   Furthermore, [RFC4916] defines a way to use the same Identity 
   mechanism to perform called party identification, by issuing a re-
   INVITE or UPDATE request from the called party to the caller.  This 
   draft describes a way to mis-use that mechanism to aid in the 
   attack. 
    
   It should be noted that neither [RFC4474] nor [RFC4916] claim to 
   prevent this form of attack, nor in fact is Baiting an attack on the 
   mechanisms themselves.  It uses the mechanisms for malicious use, 
   and shows that the mechanisms should not be assumed to provide 
   benefits they do not.  Lastly, one of the motivations in writing 
   this draft was to show that one does not need to truly be a man-in-
   the-middle in order to perform a cut-paste form of attack such as 
   Baiting. 
    
1.1. Background 
    
   SIP [RFC3261] has a transitive trust model, whereby SIP requests get 
   routed through various intermediaries.  In this model, the 
   initiating User Agents (UAs) must generally rely on the 
   intermediaries to be secure.  Such a trust model has many security 
   issues, one of which is identity proof.  As in email, if the 
   identity of the sender of a message cannot be secured, various forms 
   of impersonation attacks are possible.   
    
   Two very common issues in email today are SPAM and Phishing attacks, 
   which both benefit from impersonation.  For SIP-based applications, 
   SPIT (SPAM for Internet Telephony) is not yet a serious problem, due 
   mostly to the early stage of SIP deployment, a closed service model, 
   and fees for use.  As it grows in popularity and decreases in cost, 
   however, its potential for attracting SPIT will grow. 
    
   [RFC4474] follows a similar general model as [DKIM] for source-based 
   identity authentication, but the resulting symptoms caused by some 
   of DKIM's weaknesses has greater importance for SIP as a real-time 
   session-setup protocol than Email does.  SPAM, for example, would be 
   far less tolerated for phone calls than they would for email, even 
   if the called party ignored the call but the phone rang.   
    
2. Terminology 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.  The 
   terminology in this document conforms to RFC 2828, "Internet 
   Security Glossary".

3. Applicability 
    
   This draft applies to the [RFC4474] SIP Identity and [RFC4916] 
   Connected Identity mechanisms.  
    
    
4. Overview of the Attack 
    
   The general form of the attack is as follows: 
    
      1. An attacker, Bob, is registered at a typical [RFC3261] 
          compliant domain: example.net.  Bob wishes to attack 
          alice@example.com. 
      2. Bob "harvests" an [RFC4474] signed request from a legitimate 
          party, such as Bank.  This can be done through various means, 
          such as filling out a web form for the Bank to call him, 
          leaving a voicemail, or whatever - or possibly using the 
          [RFC4916] connected-identity mechanism, as described later in 
          this document. 
      3. Bank sends a [RFC4474] signed Invite with SDP to Bob. 
      4. Bob terminates the call attempt from Bank with a failure 
          response.   
      5. Bob takes the received SIP Invite request from Bank, inserts 
          a Via and Record-Route header of his UA's address, and 
          changes the request-URI with a new target of 
          sip:alice@example.com, the ultimate victim of the attack.  
          Bob may also change the From tag, delete the received Via's, 
          and/or possibly insert a History-Info header. 
      6. Bob sends the Invite through his domain example.net, or 
          directly to example.com, or through another domain. 
      7. The signed request is routed based on the request-URI, 
          eventually leading to Alice's Identity verifier. 
      8. Alice's domain receives the request, and verifies the 
          [RFC4474] identity signature.  In the previous steps, Bob has 
          not changed anything which was signed by [RFC4474], so the 
          validation succeeds.  Note that the To URI will most likely 
          be sip:bob@example.net, but per [RFC3261] Alice's domain does 
          not verify that the To domain is the same as Alice's domain - 
          nor could it, because the request may have simply been 
          forwarded through re-targeting, which is legitimate. 
      9. Alice's phone rings, with Bank appearing as the source 
          caller.  At this point, Bob has already succeeded in annoying 
          Alice, because her phone rang, and she thought it was Bank. 
      10. Alice picks up the phone, which sends a 200 ok response to 
          Bob. 
      11. Bob receives the SDP answer in the 200 ok, which tells him 
          where to send media to Alice.  Bob sends an ACK to Alice.

      12. Bob then sends his SPIT audio RTP to Alice, possibly spoofing 
          the IP Address and port in the SDP offer sent by Bank.  Bank 
          will not be sending RTP itself, because it does not get the 
          200 ok, and (in step 4) Bob terminated the call from Bank. 
      13. At this point Bob is successfully SPAM-ing Alice.  Alice may 
          send media to Bank, but since Bob terminated the call from 
          Bank (in step 4), Bank discards/ignores the media from Alice. 
      14. Alternatively, Bob may attempt Phishing by inserting a Call-
          Info header with a HTTP URL or even a DATA URL, and the audio 
          may tell Alice to click on the link or view the DATA URL 
          content.  Alice receives a cryptographic assertion that the 
          call is from Bank, and thus the phishing attack has a higher 
          chance of success. 
    
   Note that this form of the attack creates one-way media, from Bob to 
   Alice, which Alice believes is from Bank.  Bob can use the one-way 
   media to announce an advertisement, such as: 
    
      "Your Bank urges you to vote for <candidate> during the upcoming 
       election.  Thank you and have a nice day." 
    
   Or Bob might use the one-way audio for phishing, such as: 
    
      "This is a recording from your Bank.  Your account has been 
      compromised.  Please call us, at <attacker's phone number>, to 
      restore service to your bank account.  Thank you and have a 
      nice day." 
    
   When Alice calls the attacker's phone number, the attacker will now 
   have bi-directional audio with the victim. 
    
5. Harvesting Signed Invites 
    
   There are several ways in which an attacker, Bob, can try to harvest 
   multiple [RFC4474] signed Invite requests for malicious use: 
    
     1. Bob can have Bank call him, by submitting web contact forms, 
        leaving voicemail, etc. 
     2. If Bank calls Bob, Bob can issue 3xx redirect responses to 
        redirect the call request to another alias account, or even to 
        himself again.  This may even yield new Call-Id's for each 
        redirected request, and minimally new CSeq values - each of 
        these will have a valid [RFC4474] signature. 
     3. If Bank calls Bob, and Bank supports [RFC4028] Session Timers, 
        Bob can respond with a low Session-Expires header duration 
        (e.g., 90 seconds), with a refresher=uac parameter, and an 
        Allow header which does not include UPDATE as an allowed 
        Method, in an attempt to get Bank to issue signed re-INVITEs 
        continuously and often.

                   The SIP Identity Baiting Attack      February 2008 
 
 
     4. Bob can make a SIP call to Bank, such as Bank's 800-number IVR 
        system, expecting Bank to support [RFC4916] Connected Identity.  
        Bob can send an Allow header which does not include UPDATE as 
        an allowed Method, in an attempt to get Bank to issue a re-
        INVITE to prove its identity.   
     5. For calls initiated by Bob, Bob could include the [RFC4028] 
        'timer' Supported option tag and Session-Expires header of 
        short duration (e.g., 90 seconds), with a refresher=uas 
        parameter, in order to get Bank to issue re-INVITE's 
        continuously and often.  
     6. Bob could try to passively monitor legitimate, unencrypted, SIP 
        traffic. 
     7. Bob could try to become a "Man-in-the-Middle", for example by 
        compromising a legitimate Proxy. 
    
   Note that any signed INVITE, whether within a dialog or not, is 
   potentially useful for performing a Baiting attack.  [RFC4474] does 
   not sign the To-tag, and thus it can simply be removed for re-use as 
   a "new" INVITE.  Stateful verifiers may or may not detect such re-
   use.  And Bob can simply send them to different target domains, to 
   avoid hitting the same verifier.   
    
   Even if Bob sends multiple such INVITEs, with the same Call-Id, to 
   the same target domain, [RFC4474] is not explicit about how a 
   Verifier should behave.  Each harvested request would have a unique 
   CSeq value, and thus unique signature, and not be detected as a 
   strict replay attack per [RFC4474].  It is not clear how it really 
   could be detected as a replay, either, given the need to support 
   legitimate signed re-INVITEs within a dialog, and dialog matching 
   based on Call-Id and tags (not Call-Id alone). 
    
    
6. RFC-4474 Cut-Paste Protection 
    
   It is important to note that [RFC4474] signs the Call-Id in an 
   attempt to prevent such cut-paste attacks.  The assumption is that 
   the verifying domain keeps track of the call-id's for the duration 
   of the Date interval (typically 1 hour), and does not allow a 
   duplicate request using the same Call-Id.  This Baiting attack sends 
   the request to a domain other than the one in the To-URI, and thus 
   one harvested [RFC4474]-signed INVITE can be sent to numerous target 
   domains.   
    
   Interestingly, Bob can use one of the listed harvesting techniques 
   within a dialog or through 3xx redirects, to get additional signed 
   requests to use against different users of the *same* target domain.  
   Thus Bob could attack multiple users in the same target domain from 
   one [RFC4474] call from or to Bank.  Furthermore, if verification is 
   performed by the end UA's and not by a centralized verifier system 
 
 
Kaplan                  Expires - August 2008                [Page 6] 




                   The SIP Identity Baiting Attack      February 2008 
 
 
   for the end-domain, this attack would succeed against *all* users of 
   that domain from one harvested INVITE (because the end UAs would not 
   be able to protect each other from cut-and-pasted Call-IDs). 
    
7. Baiting with Offer-less Invites 
    
   If Bank were to generate an Invite without SDP, the attack is still 
   possible, but even more severe because the attacker (Bob) can end up 
   with a bi-directional media call.  Bob would be able to send media 
   on Alice's SDP offer in her response, and Bob could create his own 
   ACK with his SDP answer.  If Alice expects an identity-signed ACK, 
   Bob could even answer Bank's call and use Bank's signed ACK in the 
   same way as the Invite.  Note that [RFC4474] provides no mechanism 
   to determine when ACKs need to be signed, and since an ACK cannot be 
   responded to, Alice cannot really reject it either - it would be 
   silently ignored. 
    
8. Baiting with ICE 
    
   The NAT traversal mechanism defined in [ICE] would seem to aid the 
   attacker.  The password and username fragment are signed by 
   [RFC4474], but they will be clearly viewable to the attacker, and 
   thus the attacker should be able to generate STUN connectivity 
   checks using them, impersonating the legitimate caller.  We believe 
   this would mean ICE would actually enable the attacker to achieve 
   bi-directional media, for the malicious call.  [This is TBD, pending 
   review by an ICE expert (a glaciologist?)] 
    
9. Baiting with SRTP 
    
   The Baiting attack is just as successful with the [RFC4568] 
   security-descriptions key exchange mechanism, because the keys are 
   in cleartext for the attacker.  The attacker can thus generate the 
   SRTP packets to the victim.  For [DTLS-SRTP], coupled with [DTLS-
   SRTP-FRAMEWORK], the fingerprint being signed prevents a Baiting 
   attack from succeeding, because the attacker cannot successfully 
   modify the fingerprint in the [RFC4474]-signed SDP. 
    
10.  Baiting with non-INVITE Requests 
    
   It should be clear that the main focus of the Baiting attack 
   outlined in this draft is the INVITE request, however one can apply 
   Baiting to other requests.  All SIP requests outside of a dialog are 
   routed based on the request-URI or Route headers, and thus any 
   harvested request can be cut-paste to a new target.  However it is 
   harder to harvest such requests in general, and to do so in such a 
   way that it provides any real gain to cut-paste them, other than for 
   annoyance purposes.

11.  Attack Success Conditions 
    
   What makes the attack successful are the following issues with the 
   [RFC4474] mechanism: 
    
          1) Requests in SIP are routed based on the Request-URI and/or 
             Route headers, not the To-URI.  The To-URI is signed, but 
             it doesn't prevent the request being sent elsewhere and 
             accepted by parties other than that indicated in the To-
             URI.  Email-based [DKIM] has a similar issue, but at least 
             with email the To information is displayed, whereas it 
             rarely is with SIP. 
          2) Unlike Email, where all of the sensitive content is 
             contained in the body of the request, SIP is used as a 
             rendezvous and session setup protocol for the sensitive 
             content: the media.  That is why [RFC4474] signs the SDP: 
             in order to provide some protection for the ultimate 
             content.  But as this attack shows, it cannot truly do so 
             alone. 
          3) [RFC4474] does not sign the Call-Info header. 
          4) [RFC4474] does not sign the tags of the request.  While it 
             provides no clear use to do so for initial requests (which 
             have no To-tag), it would protect requests within a 
             dialog.  [RFC4916] simply re-uses the [RFC4474] mechanism, 
             and thus would benefit from this as well. 
    
    
12.  Possible Solutions? 
 
12.1.     SIP Identity and SIP Connected Identity 
 
   The purpose of this draft is to outline a security issue with 
   [RFC4474] and [RFC4916], not to fix it.  However, we outline a few 
   possible corrections to [RFC4474] to address parts of the attack: 
    
     1. Sign the Call-Info header.  It is "sensitive" in a similar way 
        as SDP or bodies. 
     2. Include the tags, or at least the To-tag, in the signed headers 
        list.  This would prevent harvested in-dialog requests from 
        being re-used outside the dialog. 
     3. Clearly specify how Verifiers should act with respect to two 
        signed requests of the same Call-Id+CSeq but different tags, 
        vs. same Call-Id but different tags+CSeq should behave.  
     4. Possibly specify that UPDATE requests without bodies are not 
        signed?  Seems like a massive overhead for session-timers to 
        sign such requests.

                   The SIP Identity Baiting Attack      February 2008 
 
 
   To address the general issue of request routing having nothing to do 
   with the signed To-URI, one possible solution is to have the UAS or 
   Verifier have a list of AoR's/To-URI's they are willing to accept 
   requests for.  In other words, if Alice's UAS or Verifier knew that 
   only requests with a To-URI of "sip:alice@example.com", and whatever 
   other aliases and lists/groups she is a member of, were allowed, 
   then the UAS or verifier could simply reject baited requests.  [in 
   fact, such a thing is probably generally useful regardless of 
   Identity signatures]  This "access list" could be provisioned by 
   Alice into her UAS, or her UAS could publish such information into 
   the Verifier, or her UAS or Verifier could learn it from her 
   Registrar through a subscribe package or config-framework, etc. 
    
   Such an access list mechanism would only work for native SIP users, 
   however.  One could not, for example, be able to create an access 
   list for a SIP-PSTN gateway, since such gateways handle calls to any 
   PSTN destination user.  This may or may not be a good property to 
   have for Identity verification, but it severely limits the 
   usefulness of [RFC4474]. 
    
    
12.2.     Secured Media with a Secret 
    
   For SIP methods involving media, such as an INVITE, the use of 
   secure media with proof of possession of a secret (such as a private
