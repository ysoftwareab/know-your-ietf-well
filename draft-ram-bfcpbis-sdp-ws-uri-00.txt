1.  Introduction

   The WebSocket protocol [RFC6455] enables bidirectional message
   exchange between clients and servers on top of a persistent TCP
   connection (optionally secured with Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   [RFC5246]).  The initial protocol handshake makes use of Hypertext
   Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [RFC2616] semantics, allowing the WebSocket
   protocol to reuse existing HTTP infrastructure.

   Modern web browsers include a WebSocket client stack compliant with
   the WebSocket API [WS-API] as specified by the W3C.  It is expected
   that other client applications (e.g., those running on personal
   computers, mobile devices, etc.) will also make a WebSocket client
   stack available.  Several specifications have been written that
   define how different applications can use a WebSocket subprotocol as
   a reliable transport mechanism.

   For example, [RFC7118] defines WebSocket subprotocol as a reliable
   transport mechanism between Session Initiation Protocol
   (SIP)[RFC3261] entities to enable use of SIP in web-oriented
   deployments.  Additionally, [I-D.pd-dispatch-msrp-websocket] defines
   a new WebSocket sub-protocol as a reliable transport mechanism
   between Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) clients and relays.
   [RFC7395] defines a WebSocket subprotocol for the Extensible
   Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).  Similarly,
   [I-D.ietf-bfcpbis-bfcp-websocket] defines a WebSocket sub-protocol as
   a reliable transport mechanism between Binary Floor Control Protocol
   (BFCP) [I-D.ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4582bis] entities to enable usage of BFCP
   in new scenarios.

Internet-Draft           WebSocket SDP Attribute              March 2015


   As defined in Section 3 of [RFC2818], when using Secure WebSockets
   the Canonical Name (CNAME) of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
   [RFC6101] certificate MUST match the WebSocket connection URI host.
   While it is possible to generate self-signed certificates with
   Internet Providers (IPs) as CNAME, in most cases it is not viable for
   certificates signed by well known authorities.  Thus, there is a need
   to indicate the connection URI for the WebSocket Client.  For
   applications that use Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] to
   negotiate, the connection URI can be indicated by means of an SDP
   attribute.  This specification defines new SDP attributes to indicate
   the connection URI for the WebSocket client.  Applications that use
   SDP for negotiation and WebSocket as a transport protocol can use
   this specification to advertise the WebSocket client connection URI.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  SDP Considerations

3.1.  'ws-uri' SDP Media Attribute

   Applications that use SDP for negotiation and also use WebSocket as a
   transport protocol MAY indicate the connection URI for the WebSocket
   Client via a new SDP a= attribute defined in this section.  The
   Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) syntax (as described in [RFC5234])
   of this new attribute is defined as follows:

      ws-uri      = "a=ws-uri:" ws-URI

   Where ws-URI is defined in Section 3 of [RFC6455].

   This new attribute MUST be a media level attribute and SHALL appear
   in any of the media lines.  When the 'ws-uri' attribute is present in
   the media section of the SDP, the IP and port information provided in
   the 'c' lines SHALL be ignored and the full URI SHALL be used instead
   to open the WebSocket connection.  The port provided in the 'm' line
   SHALL be ignored too, as the a=ws-uri SHALL provide port number when
   needed.

3.2.  'wss-uri' SDP Media Attribute

   Applications that use SDP for negotiation and also use secure
   WebSocket as a transport protocol TLS MAY indicate the connection URI
   for the WebSocket Client via a new SDP a= attribute defined in this

   section.  The Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) syntax (as described
   in [RFC5234]) of this new attribute is defined as follows:

      wss-uri      = "a=wss-uri:" wss-URI

   Where wss-URI is defined in Section 3 of [RFC6455].

   This new attribute MUST be a media level attribute and SHALL appear
   in any of the media lines.  When the 'wss-uri' attribute is present
   in the media section of the SDP, the IP and port information provided
   in the 'c' lines SHALL be ignored and the full URI SHALL be used
   instead to open the WebSocket connection.  The port provided in the
   'm' line SHALL be ignored too, as the a=wss-uri SHALL provide port
   number when needed.

3.3.  Example Usage of 'ws-uri' SDP Attribute

   The following are examples of 'm' lines for BFCP over WebSocket
   connection:

   Offer (browser):
   m=application 9 TCP/WSS/BFCP *
   a=setup:active
   a=connection:new
   a=floorctrl:c-only
   m=audio 55000 RTP/AVP 0
   m=video 55002 RTP/AVP 31

   Answer (server):
   m=application 50000 TCP/WSS/BFCP *
   a=setup:passive
   a=connection:new
   a=ws-uri:wss://bfcp-ws.example.com?token=3170449312
   a=floorctrl:s-only
   a=confid:4321
   a=userid:1234
   a=floorid:1 m-stream:10
   a=floorid:2 m-stream:11
   m=audio 50002 RTP/AVP 0
   a=label:10
   m=video 50004 RTP/AVP 31
   a=label:11

4.  Security Considerations

   An attacker may attempt to add, modify, or remove 'a=ws-uri' or
   'a=wss-uri' attribute from a session description.  This could result
   in an application behaving undesirably.  Consequently, it is strongly

   RECOMMENDED that integrity protection be applied to the SDP session
   descriptions.  For session descriptions carried in SIP [RFC3261], S/
   MIME is the natural choice to provide such end-to-end integrity
   protection.

   It is also RECOMMENDED that the application signaling traffic being
   transported over a WebSocket communication session be protected by
   using a secure WebSocket connection (using TLS [RFC5246] over TCP).

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Registration of the 'ws-uri' SDP media attribute

   This section instructs the IANA to register the following SDP att-
   field under the Session Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters
   registry:

   Contact name  Gonzalo Salgueiro

   Attribute name  ws-uri

   Long-form attribute name  Websocket Connection URI

   Type of attribute  Media level

   Subject to charset  No

   Purpose of attribute  The 'ws-uri' attribute is intended to be used
      as a connection URI for opening the WebSocket connection.

   Allowed attribute values  A ws-URI as defined in [RFC6455]

5.2.  Registration of the 'wss-uri' SDP media attribute

   This section instructs the IANA to register the following SDP att-
   field under the Session Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters
   registry:

   Contact name  Gonzalo Salgueiro

   Attribute name  wss-uri

   Long-form attribute name  Websocket Connection URI over Secure
      Transport

   Type of attribute  Media level

   Subject to charset  No

   Purpose of attribute  The 'wss-uri' attribute is intended to be used
      as a connection URI for opening the WebSocket connection over a
      secure transport.

   Allowed attribute values  A wss-URI as defined in [RFC6455]
