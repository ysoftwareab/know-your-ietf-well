   1. Introduction 

     This specification supplements [RFC 3279], "Algorithms 
     and Identifiers for the Internet X.509 Public Key 
     Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation
     List (CRL) Profile" and extends the list of 
     algorithms defined for use in the Internet PKI. This 
     document specifies algorithm identifiers and ASN.1 [X.660] 
     encoding rules for DSA and ECDSA digital signatures in 
     certificates and CRLs when using one of the SHA-2 hash 
     algorithms (SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512) as the 
     hash algorithm.

     This specification defines the contents of the 
     signatureAlgorithm, signatureValue and signature fields 
     within Internet X.509 certificates and CRLs when these 
     objects are signed using DSA or ECDSA with a SHA-2 hash 
     algorithm. These fields are more fully described in 
     [RFC 5280].

     This document profiles material presented in the "Secure 
     Hash Standard" [FIPS 180-3], "Public Key Cryptography for 
     the Financial Services Industry: The Elliptic Curve 
     Digital Signature Standard (ECDSA)" [X9.62], and the 
     "Digital Signature Standard" [FIPS 186-3]. 

     Algorithm identifiers and encoding rules for RSA, DSA and 
     ECDSA when used with SHA-1 are specified in [RFC 3279].  
     Algorithm identifiers and encoding rules for RSA when used 
     with SHA-2 are specified in [RFC 4055].

     2. One-way Hash Functions

     This section identifies four additional hash algorithms 
     for use with DSA and ECDSA in the Internet X.509 
     certificate and CRL profile [RFC 5280].

     SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 produce a 224-bit, 
     256-bit, 384-bit and 512-bit "hash" of the input 
      
      
                       Expires December 2008           [Page 3]

     respectively and are fully described in the Federal 
     Information Processing Standard 180-3 [FIPS 180-3].

     The listed one-way hash functions are identified by the 
     following object identifiers (OIDs):

        id-sha224  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { joint-iso-itu-t(2) 
        country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101)                        
        csor(3) nistalgorithm(4) hashalgs(2) 4 }

        id-sha256  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { joint-iso-itu-t(2) 
        country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) csor(3) 
        nistalgorithm(4) hashalgs(2) 1 } 

        id-sha384  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { joint-iso-itu-t(2) 
        country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101)                       
        csor(3) nistalgorithm(4) hashalgs(2) 2 }

        id-sha512  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { joint-iso-itu-t(2) 
        country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101)                       
        csor(3) nistalgorithm(4) hashalgs(2) 3 } 

     When one of these OIDs appears in an AlgorithmIdentifier, 
     all implementations MUST accept both NULL and absent 
     parameters as legal and equivalent encodings.

     3. Signature Algorithm

     Certificates and CRLs conforming to [RFC 5280] may be 
     signed with any public key signature algorithm. The 
     certificate or CRL indicates the algorithm through an 
     identifier, which appears in the signatureAlgorithm field 
     within the Certificate or CertificateList. This algorithm 
     identifier is an OID and has optionally associated 
     parameters. This section denotes algorithm identifiers and 
     parameters that MUST be used in the signatureAlgorithm 
     field in a Certificate or CertificateList.

     Signature algorithms are always used in conjunction with a 
     one-way hash function. This section identifies OIDs for 
     DSA and ECDSA with SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512. 
     The contents of the parameters component for each 
     signature algorithm vary; details are provided for each 
     algorithm.

     The data to be signed (e.g., the one-way hash function 
     output value) is formatted for the signature algorithm to 
      
      
                       Expires December 2008         [Page 4]

     be used. Then, a private key operation (e.g., DSA 
     encryption) is performed to generate the signature value. 
     This signature value is then ASN.1 encoded as a BIT STRING 
     and included in the Certificate or CertificateList in the 
     signature field. More detail on how digital signatures are 
     generated can be found in [FIPS 186-3].

     Entities that validate DSA signatures MUST support SHA-224 
     and SHA-256. Entities that validate ECDSA signatures MUST 
     support SHA-224 and SHA-256 and should support SHA-384 and 
     SHA-512. 

     3.1. DSA Signature Algorithm

     The DSA is defined in the Digital Signature Standard (DSS) 
     [FIPS 186-3]. DSA was developed by the U.S. Government, 
     and can be used in conjunction with a SHA2 one-way hash 
     function such as SHA-224 or SHA-256. DSA is fully 
     described in [FIPS 186-3].

     [FIPS 186-3] specifies four size-choices for a DSA key 
     pair of the form (public key size, private key size) in 
     bits. The four choices are (1024, 160), (2048, 224), 
     (2048, 256), and (3072, 256). More information can be 
     found in [FIPS 186-3]. 

     DSA key pairs of the sizes (1024, 160) and (2048, 224) may 
     be used with SHA-224. DSA key pairs of all the 
     four sizes may use SHA-256. The following are the OIDs of 
     the DSA digital signature algorithm when used with SHA-224 
     or SHA-256.

        When SHA-224 is used, the OID is:

        id-dsa-with-sha224 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=  { joint-iso-
        ccitt(2) country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) 
        csor(3) algorithms(4) id-dsa-with-sha2(3) 1 } 

        When SHA-256 is used, the OID is: 

        id-dsa-with-sha256 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=  { joint-iso-
        ccitt(2) country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) 
        csor(3) algorithms(4) id-dsa-with-sha2(3) 2 }

     The(3072, 256) DSA key pair provides 128 bits of security 
     and provides the most security among all the four sizes of 
     DSA key pairs. More information on security strength 
      
      
                       Expires December 2008       [Page 5] 
    
    Internet-DraftDSA/ECDSA Algorithm Identifiers June 12 2008
      

     assessments of DSA and other cryptographic algorithms can 
     be found in [SP 800-57]. A digital signature algorithm has 
     the same security strength as its asymmetric key algorithm 
     like DSA or ECDSA only if its hashing algorithm has at 
     least the same security strength as the asymmetric key 
     algorithm. Therefore, a 128-bit security strength hashing 
     algorithm which is SHA-256 will be sufficient to build a 
     128-bit security strength DSA digital signature algorithm 
     when a DSA key pair of the size (3072, 256) is used. 
     Therefore, it is only needed to specify DSA with SHA-224 
     and SHA-256 because SHA-256 provides sufficient security for 
     using with any DSA key pair of any of the four size 
     choices. More information on security strengths of the 
     hash functions SHAs specified in [FIPS 180-3] and the 
     digital signature algorithms specified in [FIPS 186-3] can 
     be found in [SP 800-107] and [SP 800-57].

     When the id-dsa-with-sha224 or id-dsa-with-sha256 
     algorithm identifier appears in the algorithm field as an 
     AlgorithmIdentifier, the encoding SHALL omit the 
     parameters field. That is, the AlgorithmIdentifier SHALL 
     be a SEQUENCE of one component, the OID id-dsa-with-sha224 
     or id-dsa-with-sha256.

     Encoding rules for DSA signature values are specified in 
     [RFC 3279]. For completeness, this information is repeated 
     below:

     When signing, the DSA algorithm generates two values 
     commonly referred to as r and s. To easily transfer these 
     two values as one signature, they SHALL be ASN.1 encoded 
     using the following ASN.1 structure:

     Dss-Sig-Value  ::=  SEQUENCE  { 
             r       INTEGER, 
             s       INTEGER  } 

     The DSA parameters in the subjectPublicKeyInfo field of 
     the certificate of the issuer SHALL apply to the 
     verification of the signature.

     3.2. ECDSA Signature Algorithm 

     The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is 
     defined in, "Public Key Cryptography for the Financial 
     Services Industry: The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature 
     Standard (ECDSA)" [X9.62]. [X9.62] provides alternative 
     mechanisms for specifying the hash algorithm used in the

   Internet-DraftDSA/ECDSA Algorithm Identifiers June 12 2008 
         

     signature generation process. Three methods are specified 
     in that document.

     1) The signature OID may explicitly identify the hash 
     algorithm, as specified in Section 3.2.1 below.

     2) The signature OID may specify that the signer used the 
     recommended hash algorithm for a given key size, as 
     described in Section 3.2.2. A verifier infers from the 
     size of the public key which hash algorithm was used.

     3) The signature OID may indicate that the hash algorithm 
     is specified as a parameter of the signature OID. The 
     verifier identifies the appropriate hash algorithm 
     according to the hash algorithm OID in the parameters 
     field.

     Conforming CA implementations MUST specify the hash 
     algorithm explicitly, using the OIDs specified in Section 
     3.2.1, when encoding ECDSA/SHA-2 signatures in 
     certificates and CRLs.

     Conforming client implementations that process ECDSA 
     signatures with any of the SHA-2 hash algorithms when 
     processing certificates and CRLs MUST recognize the 
     corresponding OIDs specified in Section 3.2.1. Conforming 
     client implementations MAY also recognize the signature 
     OIDs specified in Sections 3.2.2 and 3.2.3.

     Encoding rules for ECDSA signature values are specified in 
     [RFC 3279]. For completeness, this information is repeated 
     below:

     When signing, the ECDSA algorithm generates two values 
     commonly referred to as r and s. To easily transfer these 
     two values as one signature, they MUST be ASN.1 encoded 
     using the following ASN.1 structure: 

     Ecdsa-Sig-Value  ::=  SEQUENCE  { 
          r     INTEGER, 
          s     INTEGER  } 
      
     The elliptic curve parameters in the subjectPublicKeyInfo 
     field of the certificate of the issuer MUST be applied to 
     the verification of the signature. The 
     subjectPublicKeyInfo field must be compliant with

     requirements for Subject Public Key Information field in 
     [Elliptic Curve]. 
      
     3.2.1. ECDSA with SHA-2 Hash Algorithms

     The ASN.1 OIDs used to specify that an ECDSA signature was 
     generated using SHA224, SHA256, SHA384 or SHA 512 
     respectively:

        ecdsa-with-SHA224 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) 
        member-body(2) us(840) ansi-X9-62(10045) signatures(4) 
        ecdsa-with-SHA2(3) 1 }

        ecdsa-with-SHA256 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) 
        member-body(2) us(840) ansi-X9-62(10045) signatures(4) 
        ecdsa-with-SHA2(3) 2 }

        ecdsa-with-SHA384 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) 
        member-body(2) us(840) ansi-X9-62(10045) signatures(4) 
        ecdsa-with-SHA2(3) 3 }

        ecdsa-with-SHA512 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) 
        member-body(2) us(840) ansi-X9-62(10045) signatures(4) 
        ecdsa-with-SHA2(3) 4 }

     When the ecdsa-with-SHA224, ecdsa-with-SHA256, ecdsa-with-
     SHA384 or ecdsa-with-SHA512 algorithm identifier appears 
     in the algorithm field as an AlgorithmIdentifier, the 
     encoding MUST omit the parameters field. That is, the 
     AlgorithmIdentifier SHALL be a SEQUENCE of one component: 
     the OID: ecdsa-with-SHA224, ecdsa-with-SHA256, ecdsa-with-
     SHA384 or ecdsa-with-SHA512.

     3.2.2. ECDSA with Recommended Hash Algorithm

     The following object identifier identifies the hash 
     function to be used for message digesting implicitly, 
     based on the size of the signer's public key:

       ecdsa-with-Recommended OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1)
       member-body(2) us(840) ansi-X9-62(10045) signatures(4)
       recommended(2) }
         
     The recommended hash functions are given in [X9.62], and 
     are determined as follows. Among the hash functions SHA-1, 
     SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, the recommended one 
     has the largest bit size that does not require bit 
     truncation during the signing process. Bit truncation 
      
      
                       Expires December 2008       [Page 8]
    
   Internet-DraftDSA/ECDSA Algorithm Identifiers June 12 2008 
         

     occurs when the hash output bit-length is greater than the 
     bit length of n, the order of the base point G. (Note: 
     even if bit truncation does not occur, modular reduction 
     can occur.)

     Conforming CA implementations MUST NOT specify the ecdsa-
     with-Recommended OID when encoding certificates and CRLs.  
     To maximize interoperability, conforming client 
     implementations MAY recognize the ecdsa-with-Recommended 
     OID when processing certificates and CRLs.

     3.2.3. ECDSA with Specified Hash Algorithm

     The following object identifier identifies the hash 
     function to be used for message digesting is the one 
     specified in the parameters field of the algorithm 
     identifier:

        ecdsa-with-Recommended OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1)
        member-body(2) us(840) ansi-X9-62(10045) signatures(4)
        specified(3) }
      
     For signatures generated using one of the SHA-2 hash 
     algorithms, the parameters field would contain the 
     appropriate OID from Section 2. 
      
     Conforming CA implementations MUST NOT specify the ecdsa-
     with-Specified OID when encoding certificates and CRLs.  
     To maximize interoperability, conforming client 
     implementations MAY recognize the ecdsa-with-Specified OID 
     when processing certificates and CRLs.

  5. Security Considerations

     This specification supplements [RFC 3279]. The Security 
     Considerations section of that document applies, but is 
     specific to the RSA algorithm and this document covers the 
     DSA and ECDSA algorithms and the associated 
     considerations.

     The appropriate use of the hash functions in terms of the 
     algorithm strengths and expected time frames for secure 
     use as defined by NIST can be found in Special 
     Publications 800-78-1 [SP 800-78-1], 800-57 [SP 800-57] 
     and 800-107 [SP 800-107].

     For security reasons, in [FIPS 186-3] NIST recommends three
     types of elliptic curves for use in conjunction with one of
     the described hash functions: curves over prime fields, curves
     over binary fields, and Koblitz curves (anomalous binary 
     curves). FIPS 186-3 provides a table listing the uses and
     time periods for each algorithm and key size combinations 
     for various applications. For further details, see the 
     referenced document. 
      
     The one-way hash algorithms discussed in this document, 
     SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 each have a 
     recommended lifetime when used in combination with a 
     digital signature algorithm. NIST provides information on 
     the appropriate time periods for which each combination 
     should be used based upon the security needs of the 
     service and information being protected in NIST Special 
     Publication 800-57. A table outlines the year in which 
     NIST deems it is no longer safe to use specific 
     combinations of key lengths and algorithms of various 
     strengths for RSA, DSA, and ECDSA. NIST also provides 
     Recommendation for using NIST-approved hash algorithms in 
     the digital signature applications in [SP 800-107].

     The Special Publication 800-57 also discusses the "best 
     practices" for key management to be used by both 
     developers and system administrators. The document covers 
     the aspects of key management from algorithm selection and 
     key sizes with associated key usage period to key usage 
     (preventing key overlap), the compromise of keys and 
     keying material, and key destruction. Specific guidelines 
     are offered for key usage periods such as the lifetime of 
     a private signature key may be shorter than the lifetime 
     of the public verification key for practical applications. 
     The specification also provides recommendations on the 
     number of years various key types should be used such as 
     public and private signature keys, public and private 
     authentication keys, etc.

     NIST Special Publication 800-78-1 also lists time frames 
     for the use of combined hash algorithms and digital 
     signature algorithms for specific key types, including the

         O Personal Identity Verification (PIV) authentication 
           key,
         O Card authentication key,
         O Digital signature key, and 
         O Key management key.

     Specific requirements on the PIV can be found in 
     [FIPS 201].

     The recommendation for the size of digital signatures and 
     key management keys is more restrictive than that of 
     authentication keys, because they are used to protect data 
     for longer periods of time. Therefore, the transition 
     dates to larger key sizes are earlier in general. 

     Guidelines for the protection of domain parameters, 
     initialization vectors (IVs), and per message secret 
     numbers for use with digital signature algorithms, DSA and 
     ECSDA are provided in [FIPS 186-3]. An assurance of 
     integrity should be obtained prior to using all keying 
     material for the generation of digital signatures using 
     DSA and ECDSA. Recommendation for Obtaining Assurances for 
     Digital Signature Applications can be found in [SP 800-89].
     The purpose of this is to ensure the keying material 
     is in the proper format, the domain parameters are valid,

     the possession of the private key, the validity of the 
     public key, and that the request is coming from an 
     authorized source.

     Algorithm implementations MUST follow the appropriate 
     specification to ensure the generation of secure keys. The 
     SHA-2 algorithms are fully defined in [FIPS 180-3]. FIPS 
     186-3 defines the requirements for the digital signature 
     standard specifying the requirements for both DSA and 
     ECDSA. ECDSA is fully specified in [X9.62].

     Certificate Authorities (CAs) that issue certificates 
     using the DSA and ECDSA algorithms for key generation 
     SHOULD adhere to the recommended security guidelines for 
     key management in the NIST Special Publication 800-57. A 
     CA should use the same size or greater hash function than 
     what is used when generating keys for subscriber signature 
     certificates.
