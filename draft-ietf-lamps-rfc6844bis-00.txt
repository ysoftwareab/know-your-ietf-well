1.  Introduction

   The Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS Resource Record
   allows a DNS domain name holder to specify the Certification
   Authorities (CAs) authorized to issue certificates for that domain.
   Publication of CAA Resource Records allows a public Certification
   Authority to implement additional controls to reduce the risk of
   unintended certificate mis-issue.

Internet-Draft                     CAA                          May 2018


   Like the TLSA record defined in DNS-Based Authentication of Named
   Entities (DANE) [RFC6698], CAA records are used as a part of a
   mechanism for checking PKIX certificate data.  The distinction
   between the two specifications is that CAA records specify an
   authorization control to be performed by a certificate issuer before
   issue of a certificate and TLSA records specify a verification
   control to be performed by a relying party after the certificate is
   issued.

   Conformance with a published CAA record is a necessary but not
   sufficient condition for issuance of a certificate.  Before issuing a
   certificate, a PKIX CA is required to validate the request according
   to the policies set out in its Certificate Policy.  In the case of a
   public CA that validates certificate requests as a third party, the
   certificate will typically be issued under a public trust anchor
   certificate embedded in one or more relevant Relying Applications.

   Criteria for inclusion of embedded trust anchor certificates in
   applications are outside the scope of this document.  Typically, such
   criteria require the CA to publish a Certificate Practices Statement
   (CPS) that specifies how the requirements of the Certificate Policy
   (CP) are achieved.  It is also common for a CA to engage an
   independent third-party auditor to prepare an annual audit statement
   of its performance against its CPS.

   A set of CAA records describes only current grants of authority to
   issue certificates for the corresponding DNS domain.  Since a
   certificate is typically valid for at least a year, it is possible
   that a certificate that is not conformant with the CAA records
   currently published was conformant with the CAA records published at
   the time that the certificate was issued.  Relying Applications MUST
   NOT use CAA records as part of certificate validation.

   CAA records MAY be used by Certificate Evaluators as a possible
   indicator of a security policy violation.  Such use SHOULD take
   account of the possibility that published CAA records changed between
   the time a certificate was issued and the time at which the
   certificate was observed by the Certificate Evaluator.

2.2.  Defined Terms

   The following terms are used in this document:

   Authorization Entry: An authorization assertion that grants or denies
   a specific set of permissions to a specific group of entities.

   Certificate: An X.509 Certificate, as specified in [RFC5280].

   Certificate Evaluator: A party other than a relying party that
   evaluates the trustworthiness of certificates issued by Certification
   Authorities.

   Certification Authority (CA): An issuer that issues certificates in
   accordance with a specified Certificate Policy.

   Certificate Policy (CP): Specifies the criteria that a Certification
   Authority undertakes to meet in its issue of certificates.  See
   [RFC3647].

   Certification Practices Statement (CPS): Specifies the means by which
   the criteria of the Certificate Policy are met.  In most cases, this
   will be the document against which the operations of the
   Certification Authority are audited.  See [RFC3647].

   Domain: A DNS Domain Name.

   Domain Name: A DNS Domain Name as specified in [STD13].

   Domain Name System (DNS): The Internet naming system specified in
   [STD13].

   DNS Security (DNSSEC): Extensions to the DNS that provide
   authentication services as specified in RFC4033, RFC4034, RFC4035,
   RFC5155, and revisions.

   Issuer: An entity that issues certificates.  See [RFC5280].

   Property: The tag-value portion of a CAA Resource Record.

Internet-Draft                     CAA                          May 2018


   Resource Record (RR): A particular entry in the DNS including the
   owner name, class, type, time to live, and data, as defined in
   [STD13] and [RFC2181].

   Resource Record Set (RRSet): A set of Resource Records or a
   particular owner name, class, and type.  The time to live on all RRs
   with an RRSet is always the same, but the data may be different among
   RRs in the RRSet.

   Relying Party: A party that makes use of an application whose
   operation depends on use of a certificate for making a security
   decision.  See [RFC5280].

   Relying Application: An application whose operation depends on use of
   a certificate for making a security decision.

3.  The CAA RR Type

   A CAA RR consists of a flags byte and a tag-value pair referred to as
   a property.  Multiple properties MAY be associated with the same
   domain name by publishing multiple CAA RRs at that domain name.  The
   following flag is defined:

   Issuer Critical: If set to '1', indicates that the corresponding
   property tag MUST be understood if the semantics of the CAA record
   are to be correctly interpreted by an issuer.

   Issuers MUST NOT issue certificates for a domain if the relevant CAA
   Resource Record set contains unknown property tags that have the
   Critical bit set.

   The following property tags are defined:

   issue <Issuer Domain Name> [; <name>=<value> ]* : The issue property
   entry authorizes the holder of the domain name <Issuer Domain Name>
   or a party acting under the explicit authority of the holder of that
   domain name to issue certificates for the domain in which the
   property is published.

   issuewild <Issuer Domain Name> [; <name>=<value> ]* : The issuewild
   property entry authorizes the holder of the domain name <Issuer
   Domain Name> or a party acting under the explicit authority of the
   holder of that domain name to issue wildcard certificates for the
   domain in which the property is published.

   iodef <URL> : Specifies a URL to which an issuer MAY report
   certificate issue requests that are inconsistent with the issuer's
   Certification Practices or Certificate Policy, or that a Certificate

   Evaluator may use to report observation of a possible policy
   violation.  The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF)
   format is used [RFC5070].

   The following example is a DNS zone file (see [RFC1035]) that informs
   CAs that certificates are not to be issued except by the holder of
   the domain name 'ca.example.net' or an authorized agent thereof.
   This policy applies to all subordinate domains under example.com.

   $ORIGIN example.com
   .       CAA 0 issue "ca.example.net"

   If the domain name holder specifies one or more iodef properties, a
   certificate issuer MAY report invalid certificate requests to that
   address.  In the following example, the domain name holder specifies
   that reports may be made by means of email with the IODEF data as an
   attachment, a Web service [RFC6546], or both:

   $ORIGIN example.com
   .       CAA 0 issue "ca.example.net"
   .       CAA 0 iodef "mailto:security@example.com"
   .       CAA 0 iodef "http://iodef.example.com/"

   A certificate issuer MAY specify additional parameters that allow
   customers to specify additional parameters governing certificate
   issuance.  This might be the Certificate Policy under which the
   certificate is to be issued, the authentication process to be used
   might be specified, or an account number specified by the CA to
   enable these parameters to be retrieved.

   For example, the CA 'ca.example.net' has requested its customer
   'example.com' to specify the CA's account number '230123' in each of
   the customer's CAA records.

   $ORIGIN example.com
   .       CAA 0 issue "ca.example.net; account=230123"

   The syntax of additional parameters is a sequence of name-value pairs
   as defined in Section 5.2.  The semantics of such parameters is left
   to site policy and is outside the scope of this document.

   The critical flag is intended to permit future versions of CAA to
   introduce new semantics that MUST be understood for correct
   processing of the record, preventing conforming CAs that do not
   recognize the new semantics from issuing certificates for the
   indicated domains.

   In the following example, the property 'tbs' is flagged as critical.
   Neither the example.net CA nor any other issuer is authorized to
   issue under either policy unless the processing rules for the 'tbs'
   property tag are understood.

   $ORIGIN example.com
   .       CAA 0 issue "ca.example.net; policy=ev"
   .       CAA 128 tbs "Unknown"

   Note that the above restrictions only apply at certificate issue.
   Since the validity of an end entity certificate is typically a year
   or more, it is quite possible that the CAA records published at a
   domain will change between the time a certificate was issued and
   validation by a relying party.

4.  Certification Authority Processing

   Before issuing a certificate, a compliant CA MUST check for
   publication of a relevant CAA Resource Record set.  If such a record
   set exists, a CA MUST NOT issue a certificate unless the CA
   determines that either (1) the certificate request is consistent with
   the applicable CAA Resource Record set or (2) an exception specified
   in the relevant Certificate Policy or Certification Practices
   Statement applies.

   A certificate request MAY specify more than one domain name and MAY
   specify wildcard domains.  Issuers MUST verify authorization for all
   the domains and wildcard domains specified in the request.

   The search for a CAA record climbs the DNS name tree from the
   specified label up to but not including the DNS root '.' until CAA
   records are found.

   Given a request for a specific domain name X, or a request for a
   wildcard domain name *.X, the relevant record set RelevantCAASet(X)
   is determined as follows:

   Let CAA(X) be the record set returned by performing a CAA record
   query for the domain name X, according to the lookup algorithm
   specified in RFC 1034 section 4.3.2 (in particular chasing aliases).
   Let Parent(X) be the domain name produced by removing the leftmost
   label of X.

   RelevantCAASet(domain):
     for domain is not ".":
       if CAA(domain) is not Empty:
         return CAA(domain)
       domain = Parent(domain)
     return Empty

   For example, processing CAA for the domain name "X.Y.Z" where there
   are no CAA records at any level in the tree RelevantCAASet would have
   the following steps:

   CAA("X.Y.Z.") = Empty; domain = Parent("X.Y.Z.") = "Y.Z."
   CAA("Y.Z.")   = Empty; domain = Parent("Y.Z.")   = "Z."
   CAA("Z.")     = Empty; domain = Parent("Z.")     = "."
   return Empty

   Processing CAA for the domain name "A.B.C" where there is a CAA
   record "issue example.com" at "B.C" would terminate early upon
   finding the CAA record:

   CAA("A.B.C.") = Empty; domain = Parent("A.B.C.") = "B.C."
   CAA("B.C.")   = "issue example.com"
   return "issue example.com"

4.1.  Use of DNS Security

   Use of DNSSEC to authenticate CAA RRs is strongly RECOMMENDED but not
   required.  An issuer MUST NOT issue certificates if doing so would
   conflict with the relevant CAA Resource Record set, irrespective of
   whether the corresponding DNS records are signed.

   DNSSEC provides a proof of non-existence for both DNS domains and RR
   set within domains.  DNSSEC verification thus enables an issuer to
   determine if the answer to a CAA record query is empty because the RR
   set is empty or if it is non-empty but the response has been
   suppressed.

   Use of DNSSEC allows an issuer to acquire and archive a proof that
   they were authorized to issue certificates for the domain.
   Verification of such archives MAY be an audit requirement to verify
   CAA record processing compliance.  Publication of such archives MAY
   be a transparency requirement to verify CAA record processing
   compliance.

5.  Mechanism

5.1.  Syntax

   A CAA RR contains a single property entry consisting of a tag-value
   pair.  Each tag represents a property of the CAA record.  The value
   of a CAA property is that specified in the corresponding value field.

   A domain name MAY have multiple CAA RRs associated with it and a
   given property MAY be specified more than once.

   The CAA data field contains one property entry.  A property entry
   consists of the following data fields:

   +0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-|0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-|
   | Flags          | Tag Length = n |
   +----------------|----------------+...+---------------+
   | Tag char 0     | Tag char 1     |...| Tag char n-1  |
   +----------------|----------------+...+---------------+
   +----------------|----------------+.....+----------------+
   | Value byte 0   | Value byte 1   |.....| Value byte m-1 |
   +----------------|----------------+.....+----------------+

   Where n is the length specified in the Tag length field and m is the
   remaining octets in the Value field (m = d - n - 2) where d is the
   length of the RDATA section.

   The data fields are defined as follows:

   Flags: One octet containing the following fields:

   Bit 0, Issuer Critical Flag: If the value is set to '1', the critical
   flag is asserted and the property MUST be understood if the CAA
   record is to be correctly processed by a certificate issuer.

   A Certification Authority MUST NOT issue certificates for any Domain
   that contains a CAA critical property for an unknown or unsupported
   property tag that for which the issuer critical flag is set.

   Note that according to the conventions set out in [RFC1035], bit 0 is
   the Most Significant Bit and bit 7 is the Least Significant Bit.
   Thus, the Flags value 1 means that bit 7 is set while a value of 128
   means that bit 0 is set according to this convention.

   All other bit positions are reserved for future use.

   To ensure compatibility with future extensions to CAA, DNS records
   compliant with this version of the CAA specification MUST clear (set

   to "0") all reserved flags bits.  Applications that interpret CAA
   records MUST ignore the value of all reserved flag bits.

   Tag Length: A single octet containing an unsigned integer specifying
   the tag length in octets.  The tag length MUST be at least 1 and
   SHOULD be no more than 15.

   Tag: The property identifier, a sequence of US-ASCII characters.

   Tag values MAY contain US-ASCII characters 'a' through 'z', 'A'
   through 'Z', and the numbers 0 through 9.  Tag values SHOULD NOT
   contain any other characters.  Matching of tag values is case
   insensitive.

   Tag values submitted for registration by IANA MUST NOT contain any
   characters other than the (lowercase) US-ASCII characters 'a' through
   'z' and the numbers 0 through 9.

   Value: A sequence of octets representing the property value.
   Property values are encoded as binary values and MAY employ sub-
   formats.

   The length of the value field is specified implicitly as the
   remaining length of the enclosing Resource Record data field.

5.1.1.  Canonical Presentation Format

   The canonical presentation format of the CAA record is:

   CAA <flags> <tag> <value>

   Where:

   Flags: Is an unsigned integer between 0 and 255.

   Tag: Is a non-zero sequence of US-ASCII letters and numbers in lower
   case.

   Value: Is the <character-string> encoding of the value field as
   specified in [RFC1035], Section 5.1.

5.2.  CAA issue Property

   The issue property tag is used to request that certificate issuers
   perform CAA issue restriction processing for the domain and to grant
   authorization to specific certificate issuers.





Hallam-Baker, et al.    Expires December 1, 2018               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft                     CAA                          May 2018


   The CAA issue property value has the following sub-syntax (specified
   in ABNF as per [RFC5234]).

   issuevalue = *WSP [domain] *WSP [";" *WSP [parameters] *WSP]

   domain = label *("." label) label = (ALPHA / DIGIT) *( *("-") (ALPHA
   / DIGIT))

   parameters = (parameter *WSP ";" *WSP parameters) / parameter
   parameter = tag *WSP "=" *WSP value tag = (ALPHA / DIGIT) *( *("-")
   (ALPHA / DIGIT)) value = *(%x21-3A / %x3C-7E)

   For consistency with other aspects of DNS administration, domain name
   values are specified in letter-digit-hyphen Label (LDH-Label) form.

   A CAA record with an issue parameter tag that does not specify a
   domain name is a request that certificate issuers perform CAA issue
   restriction processing for the corresponding domain without granting
   authorization to any certificate issuer.

   This form of issue restriction would be appropriate to specify that
   no certificates are to be issued for the domain in question.

   For example, the following CAA record set requests that no
   certificates be issued for the domain 'nocerts.example.com' by any
   certificate issuer.

   nocerts.example.com CAA 0 issue ";"

   A CAA record with an issue parameter tag that specifies a domain name
   is a request that certificate issuers perform CAA issue restriction
   processing for the corresponding domain and grants authorization to
   the certificate issuer specified by the domain name.

   For example, the following CAA record set requests that no
   certificates be issued for the domain 'certs.example.com' by any
   certificate issuer other than the example.net certificate issuer.

   certs.example.com CAA 0 issue "example.net"

   CAA authorizations are additive; thus, the result of specifying both
   the empty issuer and a specified issuer is the same as specifying
   just the specified issuer alone.

   A non-empty CAA record set that contains no issue property tags is
   authorization to any certificate issuer to issue for the
   corresponding domain, provided that it is a non-wildcard domain, and
   no records in the CAA record set otherwise prohibit issuance.

Internet-Draft                     CAA                          May 2018


   An issuer MAY choose to specify issuer-parameters that further
   constrain the issue of certificates by that issuer, for example,
   specifying that certificates are to be subject to specific validation
   polices, billed to certain accounts, or issued under specific trust
   anchors.

   The semantics of issuer-parameters are determined by the issuer
   alone.

5.3.  CAA issuewild Property

   The issuewild property has the same syntax and semantics as the issue
   property except that issuewild properties only grant authorization to
   issue certificates that specify a wildcard domain and issuewild
   properties take precedence over issue properties when specified.
   Specifically:

   issuewild properties MUST be ignored when processing a request for a
   domain that is not a wildcard domain.

   If at least one issuewild property is specified in the relevant CAA
   record set, all issue properties MUST be ignored when processing a
   request for a domain that is a wildcard domain.

   A non-empty CAA record set that contains no issue or issuewild
   property tags is authorization to any certificate issuer to issue for
   the corresponding wildcard domain, provided that no records in the
   CAA record set otherwise prohibit issuance.

5.4.  CAA iodef Property

   The iodef property specifies a means of reporting certificate issue
   requests or cases of certificate issue for the corresponding domain
   that violate the security policy of the issuer or the domain name
   holder.

   The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) [RFC5070] is
   used to present the incident report in machine-readable form.

   The iodef property takes a URL as its parameter.  The URL scheme type
   determines the method used for reporting:

   mailto: The IODEF incident report is reported as a MIME email
   attachment to an SMTP email that is submitted to the mail address
   specified.  The mail message sent SHOULD contain a brief text message
   to alert the recipient to the nature of the attachment.

   to the HTTP address specified using the protocol specified in
   [RFC6546].

6.  Security Considerations

   CAA records assert a security policy that the holder of a domain name
   wishes to be observed by certificate issuers.  The effectiveness of
   CAA records as an access control mechanism is thus dependent on
   observance of CAA constraints by issuers.

   The objective of the CAA record properties described in this document
   is to reduce the risk of certificate mis-issue rather than avoid
   reliance on a certificate that has been mis-issued.  DANE [RFC6698]
   describes a mechanism for avoiding reliance on mis-issued
   certificates.

6.1.  Non-Compliance by Certification Authority

   CAA records offer CAs a cost-effective means of mitigating the risk
   of certificate mis-issue: the cost of implementing CAA checks is very
   small and the potential costs of a mis-issue event include the
   removal of an embedded trust anchor.

6.2.  Mis-Issue by Authorized Certification Authority

   Use of CAA records does not prevent mis-issue by an authorized
   Certification Authority, i.e., a CA that is authorized to issue
   certificates for the domain in question by CAA records.

   Domain name holders SHOULD verify that the CAs they authorize to
   issue certificates for their domains employ appropriate controls to
   ensure that certificates are issued only to authorized parties within
   their organization.

   Such controls are most appropriately determined by the domain name
   holder and the authorized CA(s) directly and are thus out of scope of
   this document.

6.3.  Suppression or Spoofing of CAA Records

   Suppression of the CAA record or insertion of a bogus CAA record
   could enable an attacker to obtain a certificate from an issuer that
   was not authorized to issue for that domain name.

   Where possible, issuers SHOULD perform DNSSEC validation to detect
   missing or modified CAA record sets.

Internet-Draft                     CAA                          May 2018


   In cases where DNSSEC is not deployed in a corresponding domain, an
   issuer SHOULD attempt to mitigate this risk by employing appropriate
   DNS security controls.  For example, all portions of the DNS lookup
   process SHOULD be performed against the authoritative name server.
   Data cached by third parties MUST NOT be relied on but MAY be used to
   support additional anti-spoofing or anti-suppression controls.

6.4.  Denial of Service

   Introduction of a malformed or malicious CAA RR could in theory
   enable a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.

   This specific threat is not considered to add significantly to the
   risk of running an insecure DNS service.

   An attacker could, in principle, perform a DoS attack against an
   issuer by requesting a certificate with a maliciously long DNS name.
   In practice, the DNS protocol imposes a maximum name length and CAA
   processing does not exacerbate the existing need to mitigate DoS
   attacks to any meaningful degree.

6.5.  Abuse of the Critical Flag

   A Certification Authority could make use of the critical flag to
   trick customers into publishing records that prevent competing
   Certification Authorities from issuing certificates even though the
   customer intends to authorize multiple providers.

   In practice, such an attack would be of minimal effect since any
   competent competitor that found itself unable to issue certificates
   due to lack of support for a property marked critical SHOULD
   investigate the cause and report the reason to the customer.  The
   customer will thus discover that they had been deceived.

7.  Deployment Considerations

7.1.  Blocked Queries or Responses

   Some middleboxes, in particular anti-DDoS appliances, may be
   configured to drop DNS packets of unknown types, or may start
   dropping such packets when they consider themselves under attack.
   This generally manifests as a timed-out DNS query, or a SERVFAIL at a
   local recursive resolver.

   For deployability of CAA and future DNS record types, middleboxes
   SHOULD block DNS packets by volume and size rather than by query
   type.

Internet-Draft                     CAA                          May 2018


7.2.  Rejected Queries and Malformed Responses

   Some authoritative nameservers respond with REJECTED or NOTIMP when
   queried for a resource record type they do not recognize.  At least
   one authoritative resolver produces a malformed response (with the QR
   bit set to 0) when queried for unknown resource record types.  Per
   RFC 1034, the correct response for unknown resource record types is
   NOERROR.

7.3.  Delegation to Private Nameservers

   Some domain administrators make the contents of a subdomain
   unresolvable on the public internet by delegating that subdomain to a
   nameserver whose IP address is private.  A CA processing CAA records
   for such subdomains will receive SERVFAIL from its recursive
   resolver.  The CA MAY interpret that as preventing issuance.  Domain
   administrators wishing to issue certificates for private domains
   SHOULD use split-horizon DNS with a publicly available nameserver, so
   that CAs can receive a valid, empty CAA response for those domains.

7.4.  Bogus DNSSEC Responses

   Queries for CAA resource records are different from most DNS RR
   types, because a signed, empty response to a query for CAA RRs is
   meaningfully different from a bogus response.  A signed, empty
   response indicates that there is definitely no CAA policy set at a
   given label.  A bogus response may mean either a misconfigured zone,
   or an attacker tampering with records.  DNSSEC implementations may
   have bugs with signatures on empty responses that go unnoticed,
   because for more common resource record types like A and AAAA, the
   difference to an end user between empty and bogus is irrelevant; they
   both mean a site is unavailable.

   In particular, at least two authoritative resolvers that implement
   live signing had bugs when returning empty resource record sets for
   DNSSEC-signed zones, in combination with mixed-case queries.  Mixed-
   case queries, also known as DNS 0x20, are used by some recursive
   resolvers to increase resilience against DNS poisoning attacks.
   DNSSEC-signing authoritative resolvers are expected to copy the same
   capitalization from the query into their ANSWER section, but sign the
   response as if they had use all lowercase.  In particular, PowerDNS
   versions prior to 4.0.4 had this bug.

8.  Differences versus RFC6844

   This document obsoletes RFC6844.  The most important change is to the
   Certification Authority Processing section.  RFC6844 specified an
   algorithm that performed DNS tree-climbing not only on the domain



Hallam-Baker, et al.    Expires December 1, 2018               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft                     CAA                          May 2018


   name being processed, but also on all CNAMEs and DNAMEs encountered
   along the way.  This made the processing algorithm very inefficient
   when used on domains that utilize many CNAMEs, and would have made it
   difficult for hosting providers to set CAA policies on their own
   domains without setting potentially unwanted CAA policies on their
   customers' domains.  This document specifies a simplified processing
   algorithm that only performs tree climbing on the domain being
   processed, and leaves processing of CNAMEs and DNAMEs up to the CA's
   recursive resolver.

   This document also includes a "Deployment Considerations" section
   detailing experience gained with practical deployment of CAA
   enforcement amount CAs in the WebPKI.

   This document clarifies the ABNF grammar for issue and issuewild tags
   and resolves some inconsistencies with the document text.  It also
   allows hyphens in property names.

   This document also clarifies processing of a CAA RRset that is not
   empty, but contains no issue or issuewild tags.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

9.1.  Certification Authority Restriction Flags

   IANA has created the "Certification Authority Restriction Flags"
   registry with the following initial values:

                +------+----------------------+-----------+
                | Flag | Meaning              | Reference |
                +------+----------------------+-----------+
                | 0    | Issuer Critical Flag | [RFC6844] |
                |      |                      |           |
                | 1-7  | Reserved>            | [RFC6844] |
                +------+----------------------+-----------+

   Assignment of new flags follows the RFC Required policy set out in
   [RFC5226], Section 4.1.
