Internet-Draft        Tunnel Negotiation for PMIPv6           March 2009


Abstract

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 allows a mobile node's IPv4 and IPv6 traffic
   between a Local Mobility Anchor(LMA) and a Mobile Access Gateway
   (MAG) to be tunneled using IPv6, IPv4 ,IPv4-UDP, or GRE encapsulation
   headers.  In this document, a new mobility option is specified for
   tunnel negotiation between the LMA and MAG.

Internet-Draft        Tunnel Negotiation for PMIPv6           March 2009


1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 is a network-based mobility management protocol
   that enables mobility without the involvement of the host.  [RFC5213]
   specifies IPv6 address/prefix mobility with the transport network
   being IPv6.  IPsec ESP in tunnel mode MAY be used to protect the
   mobile node's tunneled data traffic.  The support for IPv4 addressing
   or an IPv4 transport network is described in the companion document
   [I-D.ietf-netlmm-pmip6-ipv4-support].  This document supports several
   tunnel encapsulation modes like IPv6 in IPv4, IPv4 in IPv4, IPv6/IPv4
   in IPv4-UDP, or IPv6/IPv4 in IPv4-UDP-ESP.  Furthermore,
   [I-D.ietf-netlmm-grekey-option] defines a new Mobility Option for
   allowing a LMA and MAG to negotiate GRE (Generic Routing
   Encapsulation) encapsulation and exchange downlink and uplink GRE
   keys.

   It is possible that the LMA and MAG have different tunneling
   capability and preference, such as

   o  The LMA and MAG belong to different administrative domains.  The
      LMA may prefer IPSec to IP-in-IP encapsulation based on some
      policy between the MAG's domain and the LMA's.

   o  Network transition from IPv4 to IPv6.  GRE is required for
      supporting mobile nodes with overlapping private IPv4 addresses;
      IPv6-in-IPv4 encapsulation is used when core networks are IPv4
      dominant, while IPv4-in-IPv6 when transport networks are IPv6
      enabled.

   o  QoS control.  GRE key can be exploited when service providers need
      to differentiate flows and provide QoS capabilities for mobile
      nodes.

   o  ...

   In this document, a new mobility option is defined to allow the LMA
   and MAG to negotiate tunnel types.  This option is carried in Proxy
   Binding Update (PBU) and Proxy Binding Acknowledgement(PBA) messages.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The terminology in this document is based on the definitions in
   [RFC5213].

3.  Tunnel Negotiation

   Using the Tunnel Type option defined in Section 4.1 , the MAG and the
   LMA can negotiate encapsulation modes.

   When the mobile access gateway determines, based on, e.g., the MAG
   local policy, the MAG-LMA peer agreement, or loading status, that
   some type of tunnel encapsulation is needed, the mobile access
   gateway MUST include the Tunnel Type option in the Proxy Binding
   Update message sent to the local mobility anchor.  After successfully
   processing the Proxy Binding Update and accepting the tunnel type
   requested from the mobile access gateway, the LMA MUST send a
   successful Proxy Binding Acknowledgement to the MAG including a
   Tunnel Type option.

   If the requested tunnel type is not acceptable, the local mobility
   anchor MUST reject the request and send a Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement message with Status field set to
   TUNNEL_NEGOTIATION_FAILURE (TBD by IANA), and a Tunnel Type option
   MUST be included in this message to show the LMA's preference of
   encapsulation.  Then the MAG SHOULD initiate a new cycle PBU/PBA
   message exchange.

3.1.  Local Mobility Anchor Considerations

   When the local mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway
   successfully negotiates tunnel type, the local mobility anchor SHOULD
   maintain this as a part of the mobile node Binding Cache Entry(BCE )
   .  This requires that the BCE described in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 base
   specification [RFC5213] be extended.  To support the mechanism
   specified in this document, the BCE must be extended with the
   following additional field.

   o  A tunnel type indicating what kind of encapsulation is used for
      the mobile node's traffic.

3.2.  Mobile Access Gateway Considerations

   Every mobile access gateway maintains a Binding Update List entry for
   each currently attached mobile node, as described in [RFC5213].  To
   support the mechanism specified in this document, the conceptual
   Binding Update List entry data structure must be extended with the
   following new additional field.

   o  A tunnel type indicating what kind of encapsulation is used for
      the mobile node's traffic.

4.  Message Formats

4.1.  Tunnel Type Option

   A new mobility option, the Tunnel Type option, is defined for use in
   Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding Acknowledgment messages
   exchanged between the mobile access gateway and the local mobility
   anchor.  This option is used for negotiating tunnel encapsulation
   mode.

4.2.  Status Codes

   The following status code values are defined for use in the Binding
   Acknowledgment message when using Proxy Mobile IPv6.


   TUNNEL_NEGOTIATION_FAILURE (TBD less than 128)

     When the local mobility anchor receives a Proxy Binding Update
     with a Tunnel Type option while the tunnel encapsulation is
     not supported, the LMA uses this code to indicate to the mobile
     access gateway the failure of tunnel negotiation. The mobile
     access gateway then either initiates another PBU/BPA message
     exchange or terminates the registration.



5.  IANA consideration

   This document defines a new Option, the Tunnel Type Option, described
   in Section 4.1.  This option is carried in the Mobility Header.  The
   type value for this option needs to be assigned from the same
   numbering space as allocated for the other mobility options defined
   in the Mobile IPv6 specification [RFC3775].  Status code is also
   needed to be allocated


6.  Security Considerations

   In this document, the PBU and the PBA are piggybacked with tunnel
   type negotiation .  IPsec is mandatory to be used between the LMA and
   the MAG for confidentiality protection on the PBU and PBA messages.
