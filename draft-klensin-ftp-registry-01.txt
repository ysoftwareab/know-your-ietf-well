Internet-Draft           FTP Extension Registry              August 2009


1.  Introduction

   Every version of the FTP specification has added a few new commands,
   with the early ones summarized in RFC 959 [RFC0959] RFC 2389
   [RFC2389] established a mechanism for specifying and negotiating
   extensions to the FTP protocol specified in RFC 959 [RFC0959].  As
   the number of those extensions increases, it appears useful to
   establish an IANA registry to reduce the likelihood of conflict of
   names and the consequent ambiguity.  This specification establishes
   that registry.

1.1.  Discussion List

   [[anchor3: RFC Editor: please remove this section before
   publication.]]

   Until and unless a WG is created, this proposal will be discussed on
   the list apps-discuss@ietf.org


2.  Registry Definition

2.1.  Registry Name

   The recommended name of this registry is "FTP Extensions".

2.2.  Registry Format

   IANA is requested to establish an FTP extensions registry whose
   entries should include the following:

   Command Name  The FTP command, either new or modified, used in the
      extension.

   Description  A brief description of the extension.

   Parameters  A listing and brief description of any parameters
      associated with the extension.

   FEAT String  The string expected to be included in the response to
      the FEAT command (see RFC 2389) if the extension is supported.

   Reference  A reference to an RFC or other definition of the extension
      and/or to implementations supporting it (see the next section).

2.3.  Criteria for Registration

   This registry is primarily intended to avoid conflicting uses of the
   same extension names and keywords for different purposes, not to
   demonstrate that an extension is somehow "approved".  The "expert
   review" method will be used, but the designated expert is expected to
   check only that one of the two criterial that follow are met.

   1.  The extension is described in an RFC or other generally-available
       publication for which the fact of publication indicates some
       level of peer review of document quality.

   2.  The extension is actually implemented in FTP client and server
       systems that are generally available (not necessarily either free
       or unencumbered, but available) and those systems are identified
       as part of the documentation requirement above.

2.4.  Initial Contents of Registry

   ... ???  List to be supplied.  Volunteers to help with the work are
   urgently sought. ...


3.  Acknowledgments

   Any work to update or extend FTP depends on the base specification in
   RFC 959.  The contributions of its editors, Jon Postel and Joyce
   Reynolds, are gratefully acknowledged.  The option negotiation
   mechanism specified in RFC 2389 and the accumulation of features that
   has followed it made this registry relevant; the authors of those
   documents are acknowledged as well.


4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to establish the registry described in Section 2.

   New entries should be added to this registry when extensions to FTP
   are approved or defined in published RFCs.  In other words, the
   requirement for registration is "RFC Required" [RFC5226].
   [[anchor8: Note in Draft: Is there any reason to cut this back to
   "Specification Required" and specify a Designated Expert process?]]


5.  Security Considerations

   The creation of this registry provides improved documentation and
   protection against interoperability problems.  It introduces no new
