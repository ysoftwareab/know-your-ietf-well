Internet-Draft    Secure Shell Transport Model for SNMP     October 2008


1.  Introduction

   This memo describes a Transport Model for the Simple Network
   Management Protocol, using the Secure Shell protocol (SSH) [RFC4251]
   within a transport subsystem [I-D.ietf-isms-tmsm].  The transport
   model specified in this memo is referred to as the Secure Shell
   Transport Model (SSHTM).

   This memo also defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based
   internets.  In particular it defines objects for monitoring and
   managing the Secure Shell Transport Model for SNMP.

   It is important to understand the SNMP architecture [RFC3411] and the
   terminology of the architecture to understand where the Transport
   Model described in this memo fits into the architecture and interacts
   with other subsystems within the architecture.

1.1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

1.2.  Conventions

   For consistency with SNMP-related specifications, this document
   favors terminology as defined in STD62 rather than favoring
   terminology that is consistent with non-SNMP specifications.  This is
   consistent with the IESG decision to not require the SNMPv3
   terminology be modified to match the usage of other non-SNMP
   specifications when SNMPv3 was advanced to Full Standard.

   Authentication in this document typically refers to the English
   meaning of "serving to prove the authenticity of" the message, not
   data source authentication or peer identity authentication.

   The terms "manager" and "agent" are not used in this document,
   because in the RFC 3411 architecture [RFC3411], all SNMP entities



Harrington, et al.        Expires April 9, 2009                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft    Secure Shell Transport Model for SNMP     October 2008


   have the capability of acting in either manager or agent or in both
   roles depending on the SNMP application types supported in the
   implementation.  Where distinction is required, the application names
   of Command Generator, Command Responder, Notification Originator,
   Notification Receiver, and Proxy Forwarder are used.  See "SNMP
   Applications" [RFC3413] for further information.

   Throughout this document, the terms "client" and "server" are used to
   refer to the two ends of the SSH transport connection.  The client
   actively opens the SSH connection, and the server passively listens
   for the incoming SSH connection.  Either SNMP entity may act as
   client or as server, as discussed further below.

   The User-Based Security Model (USM) [RFC3414] is a mandatory-to-
   implement Security Model in STD 62.  While SSH and USM frequently
   refer to a user, the terminology preferred in RFC3411 [RFC3411] and
   in this memo is "principal".  A principal is the "who" on whose
   behalf services are provided or processing takes place.  A principal
   can be, among other things, an individual acting in a particular
   role; a set of individuals, with each acting in a particular role; an
   application or a set of applications, or a combination of these
   within an administrative domain.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Sections requiring further editing are identified by [todo] markers
   in the text.  Points requiring further WG research and discussion are
   identified by [discuss] markers in the text.

   Note to RFC Editor - if the previous paragraph and this note have not
   been removed, please send the document back to the editor to remove
   this.

1.3.  Modularity

   The reader is expected to have read and understood the description of
   the SNMP architecture, as defined in [RFC3411], and the Transport
   Subsystem architecture extension specified in "Transport Subsystem
   for the Simple Network Management Protocol" [I-D.ietf-isms-tmsm].

   This memo describes the Secure Shell Transport Model for SNMP, a
   specific SNMP transport model to be used within the SNMP transport
   subsystem to provide authentication, encryption, and integrity
   checking of SNMP messages.

   In keeping with the RFC 3411 design decision to use self-contained



Harrington, et al.        Expires April 9, 2009                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft    Secure Shell Transport Model for SNMP     October 2008


   documents, this document defines the elements of procedure and
   associated MIB module objects which are needed for processing the
   Secure Shell Transport Model for SNMP.

   This modularity of specification is not meant to be interpreted as
   imposing any specific requirements on implementation.

1.4.  Motivation

   Version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3) added
   security to the protocol.  The User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] was designed to be independent of other existing security
   infrastructures, to ensure it could function when third party
   authentication services were not available, such as in a broken
   network.  As a result, USM utilizes a separate user and key
   management infrastructure.  Operators have reported that deploying
   another user and key management infrastructure in order to use SNMPv3
   is a reason for not deploying SNMPv3.

   This memo describes a transport model that will make use of the
   existing and commonly deployed Secure Shell security infrastructure.
   This transport model is designed to meet the security and operational
   needs of network administrators, maximize usability in operational
   environments to achieve high deployment success and at the same time
   minimize implementation and deployment costs to minimize deployment
   time.

   This document addresses the requirement for the SSH client to
   authenticate the SSH server, for the SSH server to authenticate the
   SSH client, and describes how SNMP can make use of the authenticated
   identities in authorization policies for data access, in a manner
   that is independent of any specific access control model.

   This document addresses the requirement to utilize client
   authentication and key exchange methods which support different
   security infrastructures and provide different security properties.
   This document describes how to use client authentication as described
   in "SSH Authentication Protocol" [RFC4252].  The SSH Transport Model
   should work with any of the ssh-userauth methods including the
   "publickey", "password", "hostbased", "none", "keyboard-interactive",
   "gssapi-with-mic", ."gssapi-keyex", "gssapi", and "external-keyx"
   (see http://www.iana.org/assignments/ssh-parameters).  The use of the
   "none" authentication method is NOT RECOMMENDED, as described in
   Security Considerations.  Local accounts may be supported through the
   use of the publickey, hostbased or password methods.  The password
   method allows for integration with deployed password infrastructure
   such as AAA servers using the RADIUS protocol [RFC2865].  The SSH
   Transport Model SHOULD be able to take advantage of future defined



Harrington, et al.        Expires April 9, 2009                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft    Secure Shell Transport Model for SNMP     October 2008


   ssh-userauth methods, such as those that might make use of X.509
   certificate credentials.

   It is desirable to use mechanisms that could unify the approach for
   administrative security for SNMPv3 and Command Line interfaces (CLI)
   and other management interfaces.  The use of security services
   provided by Secure Shell is the approach commonly used for the CLI,
   and is the approach being adopted for use with NETCONF [RFC4742].
   This memo describes a method for invoking and running the SNMP
   protocol within a Secure Shell (SSH) session as an SSH subsystem.

   This memo describes how SNMP can be used within a Secure Shell (SSH)
   session, using the SSH connection protocol [RFC4254] over the SSH
   transport protocol, using SSH user-auth [RFC4252] for authentication.

   There are a number of challenges to be addressed to map Secure Shell
   authentication method parameters into the SNMP architecture so that
   SNMP continues to work without any surprises.  These are discussed in
   detail below.

1.5.  Constraints

   The design of this SNMP Transport Model is influenced by the
   following constraints:

   1.  In times of network stress, the transport protocol and its
       underlying security mechanisms SHOULD NOT depend upon the ready
       availability of other network services (e.g., Network Time
       Protocol (NTP) or AAA protocols).

   2.  When the network is not under stress, the transport model and its
       underlying security mechanisms MAY depend upon the ready
       availability of other network services.

   3.  It may not be possible for the transport model to determine when
       the network is under stress.

   4.  A transport model should require no changes to the SNMP
       architecture.

   5.  A transport model should require no changes to the underlying
       protocol.

2.  The Secure Shell Protocol

   SSH is a protocol for secure remote login and other secure network
   services over an insecure network.  It consists of three major
   protocol components, and add-on methods for user authentication:



Harrington, et al.        Expires April 9, 2009                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft    Secure Shell Transport Model for SNMP     October 2008


   o  The Transport Layer Protocol [RFC4253] provides server
      authentication, and message confidentiality and integrity.  It may
      optionally also provide compression.  The transport layer will
      typically be run over a TCP/IP connection, but might also be used
      on top of any other reliable data stream.

   o  The User Authentication Protocol [RFC4252] authenticates the
      client-side principal to the server.  It runs over the transport
      layer protocol.

   o  The Connection Protocol [RFC4254] multiplexes the encrypted tunnel
      into several logical channels.  It runs over the transport after
      successfully authenticating the principal.

   o  Generic Message Exchange Authentication [RFC4256] is a general
      purpose authentication method for the SSH protocol, suitable for
      interactive authentications where the authentication data should
      be entered via a keyboard

   o  Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API)
      Authentication and Key Exchange for the Secure Shell (SSH)
      Protocol [RFC4462] describes methods for using the GSS-API for
      authentication and key exchange in SSH.  It defines an SSH user
      authentication method that uses a specified GSS-API mechanism to
      authenticate a user, and a family of SSH key exchange methods that
      use GSS-API to authenticate a Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

   The client sends a service request once a secure transport layer
   connection has been established.  A second service request is sent
   after client authentication is complete.  This allows new protocols
   to be defined and coexist with the protocols listed above.

   The connection protocol provides channels that can be used for a wide
   range of purposes.  Standard methods are provided for setting up
   secure interactive shell sessions and for forwarding ("tunneling")
   arbitrary TCP/IP ports and X11 connections.

3.  How SSHTM Fits into the Transport Subsystem

   A transport model plugs into the Transport Subsystem
   [I-D.ietf-isms-tmsm].  The SSH Transport Model thus fits between the
   underlying SSH transport layer and the message dispatcher [RFC3411].

   The SSH Transport Model will establish a channel between itself and
   the SSH Transport Model of another SNMP engine.  The sending
   transport model passes unencrypted messages from the dispatcher to
   SSH to be encrypted, and the receiving transport model accepts
   decrypted incoming messages from SSH and passes them to the

Internet-Draft    Secure Shell Transport Model for SNMP     October 2008


   dispatcher.

   After an SSH Transport model channel is established, then SNMP
   messages can conceptually be sent through the channel from one SNMP
   message dispatcher to another SNMP message dispatcher.  Multiple SNMP
   messages MAY be passed through the same channel.

   The SSH Transport Model of an SNMP engine will perform the
   translation between SSH-specific security parameters and SNMP-
   specific, model-independent parameters.

3.1.  Security Capabilities of this Model

3.1.1.  Threats

   The Secure Shell Transport Model provides protection against the
   threats identified by the RFC 3411 architecture [RFC3411]:

   1.  Message stream modification - SSH provides for verification that
       each received message has not been modified during its
       transmission through the network.

   2.  Information modification - SSH provides for verification that the
       contents of each received message has not been modified during
       its transmission through the network, data has not been altered
       or destroyed in an unauthorized manner, nor have data sequences
       been altered to an extent greater than can occur non-maliciously.

   3.  Masquerade - SSH provides for both verification of the identity
       of the SSH server and verification of the identity of the SSH
       client.  SSH provides verification of the identity of the SSH
       server through the SSH Transport Protocol server authentication
       [RFC4253].

   4.  Verification of principal identity is important for use with the
       SNMP access control subsystem, to ensure that only authorized
       principals have access to potentially sensitive data.  The SSH
       user identity is provided to the transport model, so it can be
       used to map to an SNMP model-independent securityName for use
       with SNMP access control and notification configuration.  (The
       identity may undergo various transforms before it maps to the
       securityName.)

   5.  Authenticating both the SSH server and the SSH client ensures the
       authenticity of the SNMP engine that provides MIB data.
       Operators or management applications might act upon the data they
       receive (e.g., raise an alarm for an operator, modify the
       configuration of the device that sent the notification, modify



Harrington, et al.        Expires April 9, 2009                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft    Secure Shell Transport Model for SNMP     October 2008


       the configuration of other devices in the network as the result
       of the notification, and so on), so it is important to know that
       the provider of MIB data is authentic.

   6.  Disclosure - the SSH Transport Model provides that the contents
       of each received SNMP message are protected from disclosure to
       unauthorized persons.

   7.  Replay - SSH ensures that cryptographic keys established at the
       beginning of the SSH session and stored in the SSH session state
       are fresh new session keys generated for each session.  These are
       used to authenticate and encrypt data, and to prevent replay
       across sessions.  SSH uses sequence information to prevent the
       replay and reordering of messages within a session.

3.1.2.  Message Authentication

   The RFC 3411 architecture recognizes three levels of security:

      - without authentication and without privacy (noAuthNoPriv)

      - with authentication but without privacy (authNoPriv)

      - with authentication and with privacy (authPriv)

   The Secure Shell protocol provides support for encryption and data
   integrity.  While it is technically possible to support no
   authentication and no encryption in SSH it is NOT RECOMMENDED by
   [RFC4253].

   The SSH Transport Model determines from SSH the identity of the
   authenticated principal, and the type and address associated with an
   incoming message, and the SSH Transport Model provides this
   information to SSH for an outgoing message.  The transport layer
   algorithms used to provide authentication, data integrity and
   encryption SHOULD NOT be exposed to the SSH Transport Model layer.
   The SNMPv3 WG deliberately avoided this and settled for an assertion
   by the security model that the requirements of securityLevel were met
   The SSH Transport Model has no mechanisms by which it can test
   whether an underlying SSH connection provides auth or priv, so the
   SSH Transport Model trusts that the underlying SSH connection has
   been properly configured to support authPriv security
   characteristics.

   The SSH Transport Model does not know about the algorithms or options
   to open SSH sessions that match different securityLevels.  For
   interoperability of the trust assumptions between SNMP engines, an
   SSH Transport Model-compliant implementation MUST use an SSH



Harrington, et al.        Expires April 9, 2009                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft    Secure Shell Transport Model for SNMP     October 2008


   connection that provides authentication, data integrity and
   encryption that meets the highest level of SNMP security (authPriv).
   Outgoing messages requested by SNMP applications and specified with a
   lesser securityLevel (noAuthNoPriv or authNoPriv) are sent by the SSH
   Transport Model as authPriv securityLevel.

   The security protocols used in the Secure Shell Authentication
   Protocol [RFC4252] and the Secure Shell Transport Layer Protocol
   [RFC4253] are considered acceptably secure at the time of writing.
   However, the procedures allow for new authentication and privacy
   methods to be specified at a future time if the need arises.

3.1.3.  Authentication Protocol Support

   The SSH Transport Model should support any server or client
   authentication mechanism supported by SSH.  This includes the three
   authentication methods described in the SSH Authentication Protocol
   document [RFC4252] - publickey, password, and host-based - and
   keyboard interactive and others.

   The password authentication mechanism allows for integration with
   deployed password based infrastructure.  It is possible to hand a
   password to a service such as RADIUS [RFC2865] or Diameter [RFC3588]
   for validation.  The validation could be done using the user-name and
   user-password attributes.  It is also possible to use a different
   password validation protocol such as CHAP [RFC1994] or digest
   authentication [RFC5090] to integrate with RADIUS or Diameter.  At
   some point in the processing, these mechanisms require the password
   be made available as clear text on the device that is authenticating
   the password which might introduce threats to the authentication
   infrastructure.  [DISCUSS: do we really need this paragraph?

   GSSKeyex [RFC4462] provides a framework for the addition of client
   authentication mechanisms which support different security
   infrastructures and provide different security properties.
   Additional authentication mechanisms, such as one that supports X.509
   certificates, may be added to SSH in the future.

3.1.4.  Privacy Protocol Support

   The SSH transport model supports any privacy protocol used with SSH.
   [DISCUSS: The authentication support section goes into significant
   detail; should the same be done here?]

3.1.5.  Protection against Message Replay, Delay and Redirection

   SSH uses sequence numbers and integrity checks to protect against
   replay and reordering of messages within a connection.



Harrington, et al.        Expires April 9, 2009                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft    Secure Shell Transport Model for SNMP     October 2008


   SSH also provides protection against replay of entire sessions.  In a
   properly-implemented Diffie-Hellman exchange, both sides will
   generate new random numbers for each exchange, which means the
   encryption and integrity keys will be distinct for every session.

3.1.6.  SSH Subsystem

   This document describes the use of an SSH subsystem for SNMP to make
   SNMP usage distinct from other usages.

   SSH subsystems of type "snmp" are opened by the SSH Transport Model
   during the elements of procedure for an outgoing SNMP message.  Since
   the sender of a message initiates the creation of an SSH session if
   needed, the SSH session will already exist for an incoming message or
   the incoming message would never reach the SSH Transport Model.
   [DISCUSS: If a notification originator opens a subsystem called
   "snmp" and a command generator opens a subsystem called "snmp", will
   that be confusing to SSH? ]

   Implementations MAY choose to instantiate SSH sessions in
   anticipation of outgoing messages.  This approach might be useful to
   ensure that an SSH session to a given target can be established
   before it becomes important to send a message over the SSH session.
   Of course, there is no guarantee that a pre-established session will
   still be valid when needed.

   SSH sessions are uniquely identified within the SSH Transport Model
   by the combination of transportAddressType, transportAddress,
   securityName, and securityLevel associated with each session.

3.2.  Security Parameter Passing

   For incoming messages, SSH-specific security parameters are
   translated by the transport model into security parameters
   independent of the transport and security models.  The transport
   model accepts messages from the SSH subsystem, and records the
   transport-related and SSH-security-related information, including the
   authenticated identity, in a cache referenced by tmStateReference,
   and passes the WholeMsg and the tmStateReference to the dispatcher
   using the receiveMessage() ASI (Application Service Interface).

   For outgoing messages, the transport model takes input provided by
   the dispatcher in the sendMessage() ASI.  The SSH Transport Model
   converts that information into suitable security parameters for SSH,
   establishes sessions as needed, and passes messages to the SSH
   subsystem for sending.

Internet-Draft    Secure Shell Transport Model for SNMP     October 2008


3.3.  Notifications and Proxy

   SSH connections may be initiated by command generators or by
   notification originators.  Command generators are frequently operated
   by a human, but notification originators are usually unmanned
   automated processes.  As a result, it may be necessary to provision
   authentication credentials on the SNMP engine containing the
   notification originator, or use a third party key provider such as
   Kerberos, so the engine can successfully authenticate to an engine
   containing a notification receiver.

   The targets to whom notifications should be sent is typically
   determined and configured by a network administrator.  The SNMP-
   TARGET-MIB module [RFC3413] contains objects for defining management
   targets, including transport domains and addresses and security
   parameters, for applications such as notifications and proxy.

   For the SSH Transport Model, transport type and address are
   configured in the snmpTargetAddrTable, and the securityName, and
   securityLevel parameters are configured in the snmpTargetParamsTable.
   The default approach is for an administrator to statically
   preconfigure this information to identify the targets authorized to
   receive notifications or perform proxy.

   These MIB modules may be configured using SNMP or other
   implementation-dependent mechanisms, such as CLI scripting or loading
   a configuration file.  It may be necessary to provide additional
   implementation-specific configuration of SSH parameters.

4.  Cached Information and References

   When performing SNMP processing, there are two levels of state
   information that may need to be retained: the immediate state linking
   a request-response pair, and potentially longer-term state relating
   to transport and security.

   The RFC3411 architecture uses caches to maintain the short-term
   message state, and uses references in the ASIs to pass this
   information between subsystems.

   This document defines the requirements for a cache to handle the
   longer-term transport state information, using a tmStateReference
   parameter to pass this information between subsystems.

   To simplify the elements of procedure, the release of state
   information is not always explicitly specified.  As a general rule,
   if state information is available when a message being processed gets
   discarded, the state related to that message SHOULD also be



Harrington, et al.        Expires April 9, 2009                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft    Secure Shell Transport Model for SNMP     October 2008


   discarded.  If state information is available when a relationship
   between engines is severed, such as the closing of a transport
   session, the state information for that relationship SHOULD also be
   discarded.

   Since the contents of a cache are meaningful only within an
   implementation, and not on-the-wire, the format of the cache and the
   LCD are implementation-specific.

4.1.  securityStateReference

   The securityStateReference parameter is defined in RFC3411.  Its
   primary purpose is to provide a mapping between a request and the
   corresponding response.  This cache is not accessible to Transport
   Models, and an entry is typically only retained for the lifetime of a
   request-response pair of messages.

4.2.  tmStateReference

   For each transport session, information about the transport security
   is stored in a cache.  The tmStateReference parameter is used to pass
   model-specific and mechanism-specific parameters between the
   Transport subsystem and transport-aware Security Models.

   The tmStateReference cache will typically remain valid for the
   duration of the transport session, and hence may be used for several
   messages.

   Since this cache is only used within an implementation, and not on-
   the-wire, the precise contents and format are implementation-
   dependent.  However, for interoperability between Transport Models
   and transport-aware Security Models, entries in this cache must
   include at least the following fields:

      transportDomain

      transportAddress

      tmSecurityName

      tmRequestedSecurityLevel

      tmTransportSecurityLevel

      tmSameSecurity

      tmSessionID

Internet-Draft    Secure Shell Transport Model for SNMP     October 2008


4.2.1.  Transport information

   Information about the source of an incoming SNMP message is passed up
   from the Transport subsystem as far as the Message Processing
   subsystem.  However these parameters are not included in the
   processIncomingMsg ASI defined in RFC3411, and hence this information
   is not directly available to the Security Model.

   A transport-aware Security Model might wish to take account of the
   transport protocol and originating address when authenticating the
   request, and setting up the authorization parameters.  It is
   therefore necessary for the Transport Model to include this
   information in the tmStateReference cache, so that it is accessible
   to the Security Model.

   o  transportDomain: the transport protocol (and hence the Transport
      Model) used to receive the incoming message

   o  transportAddress: the source of the incoming message.

   Note that the ASIs used for processing an outgoing message all
   include explicit transportDomain and transportAddress parameters.
   These fields within the tmStateReference cache will typically not be
   used for outgoing messages.

4.2.2.  securityName

   There are actually three distinct "identities" that can be identified
   during the processing of an SNMP request over a secure transport:

   o  transport principal: the transport-authenticated identity, on
      whose behalf the secure transport connection was (or should be)
      established.  This value is transport-, mechanism- and
      implementation- specific, and is only used within a given
      Transport Model.

   o  tmSecurityName: a human-readable name (in snmpAdminString format)
      representing this transport identity.  This value is transport-
      and implementation-specific, and is only used (directly) by the
      Transport and Security Models.

   o  securityName: a human-readable name (in snmpAdminString format)
      representing the SNMP principal in a model-independent manner.

   o  Note that the transport principal may or may not be the same as
      the tmSecurityName.  Similarly, the tmSecurityName may or may not
      be the same as the securityName as seen by the Application and
      Access Control subsystems.  In particular, a non-transport-aware



Harrington, et al.        Expires April 9, 2009                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft    Secure Shell Transport Model for SNMP     October 2008


      Security Model will ignore tmSecurityName completely when
      determining the SNMP securityName.

   o  However it is important that the mapping between the transport
      principal and the SNMP securityName (for transport-aware Security
      Models) is consistent and predictable, to allow configuration of
      suitable access control and the establishment of transport
      connections.

4.2.3.  securityLevel

   There are two distinct issues relating to security level as applied
   to secure transports.  For clarity, these are handled by separate
   fields in the tmStateReference cache:

   o  tmTransportSecurityLevel: an indication from the Transport Model
      of the level of security offered by this session.  The Security
      Model can use this to ensure that incoming messages were suitably
      protected before acting on them.

   o  tmRequestedSecurityLevel: an indication from the Security Model of
      the level of security required to be provided by the transport
      protocol.  The Transport Model can use this to ensure that
      outgoing messages will not be sent over an insufficiently secure
      session.

4.2.4.  Session Information

   For security reasons, if a secure transport session is closed between
   the time a request message is received and the corresponding response
   message is sent, then the response message SHOULD be discarded, even
   if a new session has been established.  The SNMPv3 WG decided that
   this should be a SHOULD architecturally, and it is a security-model-
   specific decision whether to REQUIRE this.

   When processing an outgoing message, if tmSameSecurity is true, then
   the tmSessionID MUST match the current transport session, otherwise
   the message MUST be discarded, and the dispatcher notified that
   sending the message failed.

   o  tmSameSecurity: this flag is used by a transport-aware Security
      Model to indicate whether the Transport Model MUST enforce this
      restriction.

   o  tmSessionID: in order to verify whether the session has changed,
      the Transport Model must be able to compare the session used to
      receive the original request with the one to be used to send the
      response.  This typically requires some form of session



Harrington, et al.        Expires April 9, 2009                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft    Secure Shell Transport Model for SNMP     October 2008


      identifier.  This value is only ever used by the Transport Model,
      so the format and interpretation of this field are model-specific
      and implementation-dependent.

4.3.  Secure Shell Transport Model Cached Information

   The Secure Shell Transport Model has specific responsibilities
   regarding the cached information.  See the Elements of Procedure for
   detailed processing instructions on the use of the tmStateReference
   fields by the SSH Transport Model.

4.3.1.  tmSecurityName

   The tmSecurityName MUST be a human-readable name (in snmpAdminString
   format) representing the identity that has been authenticated by the
   SSH layer.

   The identity SHOULD be the value of the user name field of the
   SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST message for which a SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_SUCCESS
   has been received.  How the SSH user name is extracted from the SSH
   layer is implementation-dependent.

   The SSH protocol is not always clear on whether the user name field
   must be filled in, so for some implementations, such as those using
   GSSAPI authentication, it may be necessary to use a mapping algorithm
   to transform a user name to a SSH identity compatible with the
   parameters required by this transport.  How a compatible SSH identity
   is determined should be administratively configurable if such a
   mapping is needed.

   The securityName derived from the tmSecurityName by a security model
   is used to configure notifications and access controls.  Non-default
   transport model transforms SHOULD generate a predictable identity
   representing the principal.

4.3.2.  tmSessionID

   The tmSessionID must be refreshed upon each received message, so that
   it can be used to determine whether the SSH session available for
   sending an outgoing message is the same SSH session as was used when
   receiving the corresponding incoming message (e.g., a response to a
   request), when tmSameSecurity is set.

4.3.3.  session state

   The per-session state that is referenced by tmStateReference may be
   saved across multiple messages in a Local Configuration Datastore.
   Additional session/connection state information might also be stored



Harrington, et al.        Expires April 9, 2009                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft    Secure Shell Transport Model for SNMP     October 2008


   in a Local Configuration Datastore.

5.  Elements of Procedure

   Abstract service interfaces have been defined by RFC 3411 to describe
   the conceptual data flows between the various subsystems within an
   SNMP entity.  The Secure Shell Transport Model uses some of these
   conceptual data flows when communicating between subsystems.  These
   RFC 3411-defined data flows are referred to here as public
   interfaces.

   To simplify the elements of procedure, the release of state
   information is not always explicitly specified.  As a general rule,
   if state information is available when a message gets discarded, the
   message-state information should also be released, and if state
   information is available when a session is closed, the session state
   information should also be released.

   An error indication may return an OID and value for an incremented
   counter and a value for securityLevel, and values for contextEngineID
   and contextName for the counter, and the securityStateReference if
   the information is available at the point where the error is
   detected.  ContextEngineID and contextName are not accessible to
   Transport Models, so contextEngineID is set to the local value of
   snmpEngineID, and contextName is set to the default context for error
   counters.

5.1.  Procedures for an Incoming Message

   1) The SSH Transport Model queries the SSH engine, in an
   implementation-dependent manner, to determine the transportAddress,
   the principal name authenticated by SSH, and a session identifier.

   By default, the principal name is the value of the user name field of
   the SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST message for which a
   SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_SUCCESS has been received.  How this name is
   extracted from the SSH environment is implementation-dependent.

   2) Create a tmStateReference cache for subsequent reference to the
   information.

      tmTransportDomain = snmpSSHDomain

      tmTransportAddress = the address the message originated from,
      determined in an implementation-dependent way

      tmSecurityLevel = "authPriv"




Harrington, et al.        Expires April 9, 2009                [Page 18]

Internet-Draft    Secure Shell Transport Model for SNMP     October 2008


      tmSecurityName = the ssh principal name

      tmSessionID = an implementation-dependent value that can be used
      to detect when a session has closed and been replaced by another
      session.  The value in tmStateReference should identify the
      session over which the message was received.

   Then the Transport model passes the message to the Dispatcher using
   the following ASI:

   statusInformation =
   receiveMessage(
   IN   transportDomain       -- snmpSSHDomain
   IN   transportAddress      -- address for the received message
   IN   wholeMessage          -- the whole SNMP message from SSH
   IN   wholeMessageLength    -- the length of the SNMP message
   IN   tmStateReference      -- (NEW) transport info
    )

5.2.  Procedures for an Outgoing Message

   The Dispatcher passes the information to the Transport Model using
   the ASI defined in the transport subsystem:


   statusInformation =
   sendMessage(
   IN   destTransportDomain           -- transport domain to be used
   IN   destTransportAddress          -- transport address to be used
   IN   outgoingMessage               -- the message to send
   IN   outgoingMessageLength         -- its length
   IN   tmStateReference              -- (NEW) transport info
   )

   The SSH Transport Model performs the following tasks.  Other
   implementation dependent steps may also be needed.

      1) Extract the tmTransportAddress, tmSecurityName, tmSameSecurity,
      and tmSessionID from the tmStateReference.  (SSHTM ignores the
      provided tmTransportDomain and tmRequestedSecurityLevel.)

      2) Using tmTransportAddress and tmSecurityName or some other
      implementation dependent way, determine if a corresponding entry
      in the LCD exists.

      3) If there is a corresponding entry, and tmSameSecurity is true,
      and tmSessionID does not match the session id stored in the LCD,
      then increment the sshtmSessionNoAvailableSessions counter,



Harrington, et al.        Expires April 9, 2009                [Page 19]

Internet-Draft    Secure Shell Transport Model for SNMP     October 2008


      discard the message and return the error indication in the
      statusInformation.  Processing of this message stops.

      4) If there is no corresponding LCD entry, then call openSession()
      with the tmTransportAddress and tmSecurityName as parameters.

      4b) If an error is returned from OpenSession(), then discard the
      message, and return the error indication returned by OpenSession()
      in the statusInformation.

      5) Pass the wholeMessage to SSH for encapsulation as data in an
      SSH message.

5.3.  Establishing a Session

   The Secure Shell Transport Model provides the following application
   service interface (ASI) to describe the data passed between the SSH
   Transport Model and the SSH service.  It is an implementation
   decision how such data is passed.

   statusInformation =
   openSession(
   IN   destTransportAddress     -- transport address to be used
   IN   tmSecurityName             -- on behalf of this principal
   IN   maxMessageSize           -- of the sending SNMP entity
    )


   The following describes the procedure to follow to establish a
   session between a client and server to run SNMP over SSH.  This
   process is used by any SNMP engine establishing a session for
   subsequent use.

   This will be done automatically for an SNMP application that
   initiates a transaction, such as a Command Generator or a
   Notification Originator or a Proxy Forwarder.

   1) Using destTransportAddress, the client will establish an SSH
   transport connection using the SSH transport protocol, authenticate
   the server, and exchange keys for message integrity and encryption.
   The destTransportAddress field may contain a user-name followed by an
   '@' character (ASCII 0x40) that will indicate a specific user-name
   string that should presented to the ssh server as the "user name" for
   authentication purposes.  This may be different than the passed
   tmSecurityName value that should be used in the remaining steps
   below.  If there is no specified user-name in the
   destTransportAddress then the tmSecurtityName should be used as the
   user-name.  The other parameters of the transport connection and the

Internet-Draft    Secure Shell Transport Model for SNMP     October 2008


   credentials used to authenticate are provided in an implementation-
   dependent manner.

   If the attempt to establish a connection is unsuccessful, or server
   authentication fails, then sshtmSessionOpenErrors is incremented, and
   an openSession error indication is returned, and openSession
   processing stops.

   2) Create an entry in the LCD containing, at a minimum, a cache of
   the following information:

      tmTransportAddress

      tmSecurityName

   3)In an implementation-specific manner, pass the calculated user-name
   from step 1) to the SSH layer.  The client will then invoke an SSH
   authentications service to authenticate the principal, such as that
   described in the SSH authentication protocol [RFC4252].  The
   credentials used to authenticate the user are determined in an
   implementation-dependent manner.

   If the authentication is unsuccessful, then the transport connection
   is closed, tmStateReference is released, the message is discarded,
   the sshtmSessionUserAuthFailures counter is incremented, an error
   indication is returned to the calling module, and processing stops
   for this message.

   4) Once the principal has been successfully authenticated, the client
   will invoke the "ssh- connection" service, also known as the SSH
   connection protocol [RFC4254].

   5) After the ssh-connection service is established, the client will
   request a channel of type "session" in an implementation-dependent
   manner.  If unsuccessful, the transport connection is closed,
   tmStateReference is released, the message is discarded, the
   sshtmSessionChannelOpenFailures counter is incremented, an error
   indication is returned to the calling module, and processing stops
   for this message.

   6) If successful, this will result in an SSH session.  Store the
   session identifier in the corresponding LCD entry.  Increment the
   sshtmSessionOpens counter.

   7) Once the SSH session has been established, the client will invoke
   SNMP as an SSH subsystem, as indicated in the "subsystem" parameter.

   In order to allow SNMP traffic to be easily identified and filtered



Harrington, et al.        Expires April 9, 2009                [Page 21]

Internet-Draft    Secure Shell Transport Model for SNMP     October 2008


   by firewalls and other network devices, servers associated with SNMP
   entities using the Secure Shell Transport Model MUST default to
   providing access to the "SNMP" SSH subsystem if the SSH session is
   established using the IANA-assigned TCP port.  Servers SHOULD be
   configurable to allow access to the SNMP SSH subsystem over other
   ports.

5.4.  Closing a Session

   The Secure Shell Transport Model provides the following ASI to close
   a session:

   statusInformation =
   closeSession(
   IN   tmTransportAddress     -- transport address to be used
   IN   tmSecurityName             -- on behalf of this principal
    )



   The following describes the procedure to follow to close a session
   between a client and sever .  This process is followed by any SNMP
   engine to close an SSH session.  It is implementation-dependent when
   a session should be closed.

      1) Look up the session information in the LCD using the
      tmTransportAddress and tmSecurityName or other implementation-
      dependent mechanism.

      2) If there is no entry, then closeSession processing is
      completed.

      3) Extract the session identifier from the LCD entry.  Have SSH
      close the session.  Increment the sshtmSessionCloses counter.

6.  MIB Module Overview

   This MIB module provides management of the Secure Shell Transport
   Model.  It defines some needed textual conventions, and some
   statistics.

6.1.  Structure of the MIB Module

   Objects in this MIB module are arranged into subtrees.  Each subtree
   is organized as a set of related objects.  The overall structure and
   assignment of objects to their subtrees, and the intended purpose of
   each subtree, is shown below.

6.2.  Textual Conventions

   Generic and Common Textual Conventions used in this document can be
   found summarized at http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-common-tcs.html

6.3.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   Some management objects defined in other MIB modules are applicable
   to an entity implementing the SSH Transport Model.  In particular, it
   is assumed that an entity implementing the SSHTM-MIB will implement
   the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418], the SNMP-FRAMEWORK-MIB [RFC3411] and the
   SNMP-TRANSPORT-MIB [I-D.ietf-isms-tmsm].

   This MIB module is for managing SSH Transport Model information.
   This MIB module models a sample Local Configuration Datastore for the
   Transport Model (not for SSH or an associated security model).

6.3.1.  MIB Modules Required for IMPORTS

   The following MIB module imports items from [RFC2578], [RFC2579],
   [RFC2580].

   This MIB module also references [RFC3490] and [RFC3986]

         address is of type SnmpSSHAddress.

         When an SNMP entity uses the snmpSSHDomain transport
         model, it must be capable of accepting messages up to
         and including 8192 octets in size. Implementation of
         larger values is encouraged whenever possible.

         The securityName prefix to be associated with the
         snmpSSHDomain is 'ssh'. This prefix may be used by security
         models or other components to identify what secure transport
         infrastructure authenticated a securityName. For further

SnmpSSHAddress ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT "1a"
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "Represents either a hostname or IP address, along with a port
         number and an optional username.

         The beginning of the address specification may contain a
         username followed by an '@' (ASCII character 0x40). This
         portion of the address will indicate the user name that should
         be used when authenticating to an SSH server. If missing, the
         SNMP securityName should be used. After the optional user name
         field and '@' character comes the hostname.

         The hostname must be encoded in ASCII, as specified in
         RFC3490 (Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications)
         followed by a colon ':' (ASCII character 0x3A) and a
         decimal port number in ASCII. The name SHOULD be fully
         qualified whenever possible.

         An IPv4 address must be a dotted decimal format followed
         by a colon ':' (ASCII character 0x3A) and a decimal port
         number in ASCII.

         An IPv6 address must be a colon separated format, surrounded by
         brackets ('[' ASCII character 0x5B and ']' ASCII character
         0x5D), followed by a colon ':' (ASCII character 0x3A) and a
         decimal port number in ASCII.

         Values of this textual convention may not be directly useable
         as transport-layer addressing information, and may require
         runtime resolution. As such, applications that write them
         must be prepared for handling errors if such values are
         not supported, or cannot be resolved (if resolution occurs
         at the time of the management operation).

         The DESCRIPTION clause of TransportAddress objects that may
         have snmpSSHAddress values must fully describe how (and
         when) such names are to be resolved to IP addresses and vice
         versa.

         This textual convention SHOULD NOT be used directly in
         object definitions since it restricts addresses to a
         specific format. However, if it is used, it MAY be used
         either on its own or in conjunction with

         TransportAddressType or TransportDomain as a pair.

         When this textual convention is used as a syntax of an
         index object, there may be issues with the limit of 128
         sub-identifiers specified in SMIv2, STD 58. It is
         RECOMMENDED that all MIB documents using this textual
         convention make explicit any limitations on index
         component lengths that management software must observe.
         This may be done either by including SIZE constraints on
         the index components or by specifying applicable
         constraints in the conceptual row DESCRIPTION clause or
         in the surrounding documentation.

8.  Operational Considerations

   The SSH Transport Model will likely not work in conditions where
   access to the CLI has stopped working.  In situations where SNMP
   access has to work when the CLI has stopped working, a UDP transport
   model should be considered instead of the SSH Transport Model.

   The SSH Transport Model defines two well-known default ports, one for
   request/response traffic, and one port that listens for
   notifications.

   If the SSH Transport Model is configured to utilize AAA services,
   operators should consider configuring support for a local
   authentication mechanisms, such as local passwords, so SNMP can
   continue operating during times of network stress.

   The SSH protocol has its own windowing mechanism.  RFC 4254 says: The
   window size specifies how many bytes the other party can send before
   it must wait for the window to be adjusted.  Both parties use the
   following message to adjust the window.  The SSH specifications leave
   it open when such window adjustment messages are created.  Some
   implementations have been found to send window adjustment messages
   whenever received data has been passed to the application.  Since



Harrington, et al.        Expires April 9, 2009                [Page 29]

Internet-Draft    Secure Shell Transport Model for SNMP     October 2008


   window adjustment messages are padded, encrypted, hmac'ed, and
   wrapped, this results in noticeable bandwidth and processing
   overhead, which can be avoided by sending window adjustment messages
   less frequently.

   The SSH protocol requires the execution of CPU intensive calculations
   to establish a session key during session establishment.  This means
   that short lived sessions become computationally expensive compared
   to USM, which does not have a notion of a session key.  Other
   transport security protocols such as TLS support a session resumption
   feature that allows reusing a cached session key.  Such a mechanism
   does not exist for SSH and thus SNMP applications should keep SSH
   sessions for longer time periods.

   To initiate SSH connections, an entity must be configured with SSH
   client credentials and information to authenticate the server.  While
   hosts are often configured to be SSH clients, most internetworking
   devices are not.  To send notifications over SSHTM, the
   internetworking device will need to be configured to be SSH clients.
   How this credential configuration is done is implementation and
   deployment specific.  A scalable IETF standard protocol for
   configuration or key management is RECOMMENDED.

9.  Security Considerations

   This document describes a transport model that permits SNMP to
   utilize SSH security services.  The security threats and how the SSH
   Transport Model mitigates those threats is covered in detail
   throughout this memo.

   The SSH Transport Model relies on SSH mutual authentication, binding
   of keys, confidentiality and integrity.  Any authentication method
   that meets the requirements of the SSH architecture will provide the
   properties of mutual authentication and binding of keys.  While SSH
   does support turning off confidentiality and integrity, they SHOULD
   NOT be turned off when used with the SSH Transport Model.

   SSHv2 provides Perfect Forward Security (PFS) for encryption keys.
   PFS is a major design goal of SSH, and any well-designed keyex
   algorithm will provide it.

   The security implications of using SSH are covered in [RFC4251].

   The SSH Transport Model has no way to verify that server
   authentication was performed, to learn the host's public key in
   advance, or verify that the correct key is being used.  The SSH
   Transport Model simply trusts that these are properly configured by
   the implementer and deployer.

9.1.  noAuthPriv

   SSH provides the "none" userauth method, which is normally rejected
   by servers and used only to find out what userauth methods are
   supported.  However, it is legal for a server to accept this method,
   which has the effect of not authenticating the SSH client to the SSH
   server.  Doing this does not compromise authentication of the SSH
   server to the SSH client, nor does it compromise data confidentiality
   or data integrity.

   SSH supports anonymous access.  If the SSH Transport Model can
   extract from SSH an authenticated principal to map to securityName,
   then anonymous access SHOULD be supported.  It is possible for SSH to
   skip entity authentication of the client through the "none"
   authentication method to support anonymous clients, however in this
   case an implementation MUST still support data integrity within the
   SSH transport protocol and provide an authenticated principal for
   mapping to securityName for access control purposes.

   The RFC 3411 architecture does not permit noAuthPriv.  The SSH
   Transport Model SHOULD NOT be used with an SSH connection with the
   "none" userauth method.

9.2.  Use with SNMPv1/v2c Messages

   The SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c message processing described in RFC3584 (BCP
   74) [RFC3584] always selects the SNMPv1(1) Security Model for an
   SNMPv1 message, or the SNMPv2c(2) Security Model for an SNMPv2c
   message.  When running SNMPv1/SNMPv2c over a secure transport like
   the SSH Transport Model, the securityName and securityLevel used for
   access control decisions are then derived from the community string,
   not the authenticated identity and securityLevel provided by the SSH
   Transport Model.

9.3.  Skipping Public Key Verification

   Most key exchange algorithms are able to authenticate the SSH
   server's identity to the client.  However, for the common case of DH
   signed by public keys, this requires the client to know the host's
   public key a priori and to verify that the correct key is being used.
   If this step is skipped, then authentication of the SSH server to the
   SSH client is not done.  Data confidentiality and data integrity
   protection to the server still exist, but these are of dubious value
   when an attacker can insert himself between the client and the real
   SSH server.  Note that some userauth methods may defend against this
   situation, but many of the common ones (including password and
   keyboard-interactive) do not, and in fact depend on the fact that the
   server's identity has been verified (so passwords are not disclosed

Internet-Draft    Secure Shell Transport Model for SNMP     October 2008


   to an attacker).

   SSH MUST NOT be configured to skip public key verification for use
   with the SSH Transport Model.

9.4.  The 'none' MAC Algorithm

   SSH provides the "none" MAC algorithm, which would allow you to turn
   off data integrity while maintaining confidentiality.  However, if
   you do this, then an attacker may be able to modify the data in
   flight, which means you effectively have no authentication.

   SSH MUST NOT be configured using the "none" MAC algorithm for use
   with the SSH Transport Model.

9.5.  MIB Module Security

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  The readable objects in this MIB module are not sensitive.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec or
   SSH), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network
   is allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the
   objects in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410] section 8), including
   full support for the USM and the SSH Transport Model cryptographic
   mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an

   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

10.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign:

   1.  a TCP port number in the range 1..1023 in the
       http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers registry which will
       be the default port for SNMP over an SSH Transport Model as
       defined in this document,

   2.  an SMI number under mib-2, for the MIB module in this document,

   3.  an SMI number under snmpDomains, for the snmpSSHDomain,

   4.  "ssh" as the corresponding prefix for the snmpSSHDomain in the
       SNMP Transport Model registry;

   5.  "snmp" as an SSH Service Name in the
       http://www.iana.org/assignments/ssh-parameters registry.

Appendix A.  Open Issues

   We need to reach consensus on some issues.

   Here is the current list of issues from the SSH Transport Model
   document where we need to reach consensus.

   o  Issue #2: In USM, there is a mapping table that permits one user
      to have multiple methods for authentication, that map to a common
      securityName.  Since SSH supports multiple authentication
      mechanisms, do we need to specify how these mechanism-specific
      identities map to a common securityName?  This is important to
      permit admins to configure the TARGET-MIB, for example, with one
      common identity rather than mechanism-specific identities.

   o  Issue #3: Mapping from the sshtmLCDTable identity to an SSH
      mechanisms-specific identity.  This may just be the opposite
      transform of Issue #2.

   o  Issue #5: what are the elements of procedure if you run for
      example SNMPv3/USM over SSHTM?  The ASIs do not have parameters to
      identify two methods of authentication, and it is unclear how an
      outgoing message request would specify both SNMPv3/USM and SSHTM
      should be used, and which securityName/Level should be used for
      each.

   o  Issue #6: We have not resolved whether the principal associated
      with a notification receiver must be a principal (aka user) or
      whether a hostname is adequate.  In SNMPv3, the access controls
      are symmetrical - it is a user-level principal that access
      controls apply to, whether for R/R or notify applications.  Is it
      acceptable to have user-level for R/R and host-level for notify

      functionality?  A user that is not allowed to GET an object might
      be able to have the value of the object reported in a
      notification, or vice-versa.  This is not much different that a
      principal having two different identities, one for R/R and another
      for notifications, or an admin configuring systems to send
      notifications to a different principal than those who do R/R
      processing.  The WG needs to discuss this and reach some consensus
      on whether this is an issue or not, and how we want to proceed.

   TODO:

Appendix B.  Change Log

   From -11- to -12

      updated "Cached Information and References" to match other ISMS
      documents.

      Added separate subsection on Secure Shell Transport Model Cached
      Information.

      Added IANA considerations to establish a registry for domains and
      corresponding prefixes.

   From -10- to -11

      Changed LCD to sshtmLCDTable so it would not be confused with the
      snmpTsmLCD.

      Removed the text that said the format and content of the LCD is
      implementation-specific, since we now have a MIB module to
      standardize the format and content.

      Designed sshtmLCDTable to reflect there is only one
      transportDomain and one securityLevel supported by this transport
      model.

      Used sshtmLCDTmSecurityName to reflect that the values in this
      table and the values in the tmStateReference are usually the same
      for some fields.

      Added operational considerations about SSH client credential
      distribution.

      Modified EOP to use sshtmLCDTable

Internet-Draft    Secure Shell Transport Model for SNMP     October 2008


      Resolved Issue #8: Should we allow transport models to select the
      corresponding security model by providing an additional parameter
      - the securityModel parameter - to tmStateReference, which would
      override the securityModel parameter extracted from a message
      header?  Doing this would resolve Issue #5, and would allow the
      transport security model to be used with all SNMP message
      versions. - The consensus is that we will not allow the transport
      model to specify the security model.

   From -09- to -10

      Issue #1: Made release of cached session info an implementation
      requirement on session close.

      Issue #4: UTF-8 syntax of userauth user name matches syntax of
      SnmpAdminString.

      Issue #7: Resolved to not describe how an SSH session is closed.

   From -08- to -09

      Updated MIB assignment to by rfc4181 compatible

      update MIB security considerations with coexistence issues

      update sameSession and tmSessionID support

      Fixed note about terminology, for consistency with SNMPv3.

      Added support for user@ prefixing in the SSH Transport Address
      definition and EOP.

      Added support for the "ssh" prefix to the transport address
      definition and IANA considerations section.

      Removed the LCD tables and related configuration since the user@
      transport address prefixing and the TSM user prefix changes change
      makes it no longer needed.

   From -07- to -08

      Updated MIB

      update MIB security considerations

      develop sameSession and tmSessionID support

Internet-Draft    Secure Shell Transport Model for SNMP     October 2008


      Added a note about terminology, for consistency with SNMPv3 rather
      than with RFC2828.

      Removed reference to mappings other than the identity function.

   From -06- to -07

      removed section on SSH to EngineID mappings, since engineIDs are
      not exposed to the transport model

      removed references to engineIDs and discovery

      removed references to securityModel.

      added security considerations warning about using with SNMPv1/v2c
      messages.

      added keyboard interactive discussion

      noted some implementation-dependent points

      removed references to transportModel; we use the transport domain
      as a model identifier.

      cleaned up ASIs

      modified MIB to be under snmpModules

      changed transportAddressSSH to snmpSSHDomain style addressing

   From -05- to -06

      replaced transportDomainSSH with RFC3417-style snmpSSHDomain

      replaced transportAddressSSH with RFC3417-style snmpSSHAddress

      Changed recvMessage to receiveMessage, and modified OUT to IN to
      match TMSM.

   From -04- to -05

      added sshtmUserTable

      moved session table into the transport model MIB from the
      transport subsystem MIB

      added and then removed Appendix A - Notification Tables
      Configuration (see Transport Security Model)

Internet-Draft    Secure Shell Transport Model for SNMP     October 2008


      made this document a specification of a transport model, rather
      than a security model in two parts.  Eliminated TMSP and MPSP and
      replaced them with "transport model" and "security model".

      Removed security-model-specific processing from this document.

      Removed discussion of snmpv3/v1/v2c message format co-existence

      changed tmSessionReference back to tmStateReference

   "From -03- to -04-"

      changed tmStateReference to tmSessionReference



   "From -02- to -03-"

      rewrote almost all sections

      merged ASI section and Elements of Procedure sections

      removed references to the SSH user, in preference to SSH client

      updated references

      created a conventions section to identify common terminology.

      rewrote sections on how SSH addresses threats

      rewrote mapping SSH to engineID

      eliminated discovery section

      detailed the Elements of Procedure

      eliminated sections on msgFlags, transport parameters

      resolved issues of opening notifications

      eliminated sessionID (TMSM needs to be updated to match)

      eliminated use of tmsSessiontable except as an example

      updated Security Considerations

   "From -01- to -02-"

      Removed unnecessary MIB module objects

      updated references

      improved consistency of references to TMSM as architectural
      extension

      updated conventions

      updated threats to be more consistent with RFC3552

      discussion of specific SSH mechanism configurations moved to
      security considerations

      modified session discussions to reference TMSM sessions

      expanded discussion of engineIDs

      wrote text to clarify the roles of MPSP and TMSP

      clarified how snmpv3 message parts are ised by SSHSM

      modified nesting of subsections as needed

      securityLevel used by the SSH Transport Model always equals
      authPriv

      removed discussion of using SSHSM with SNMPv1/v2c

      started updating Elements of Procedure, but realized missing info
      needs discussion.

      updated MIB module relationship to other MIB modules

   "From -00- to -01-"

      -00- initial draft as ISMS work product:

      updated references to secshell RFCs
