4. Abstract
   
   This Internet Draft describes a method for automatic discovery of
   Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) PE nodes and services, in order 
   to establish VPLS networks.
   
   The node discovery is done using new Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)
   link-state advertisements (LSA), and service discovery is done by using
   targeted-LDP address messages as was suggested by previous drafts.
   
   In previous drafts VPLS PE nodes discovery was made via unsolicited LDP
   and required establishment of hop by hop LDP sessions across the
   network. This memo suggests the removal of the need for hop by hop 
   unsolicited LDP advertisements in order to discover the VPLS PE nodes.
   It enables carriers to use any desired protocol to signal the MPLS LSP
   tunnels underlying the VPLS(VPLS (for example [RSVP-TE] Or [LDP]).
   
   This memo also describes a method that enables carriers to establish a
   partial VPLS mesh according to a new VPLS group advertisement in the
   IGP LSA.
   
   The goal is to create VPLS networks with a minimum amount of
   configuration, while maintaining (and improving when
   possible) network scalability.

5. Overview
   
   As L2 VPN services are being deployed in carriers' networks to serve
   the growing demand for multipoint L2 VPNs, more Virtual Private LAN
   Services (VPLS) networks are being established to provide these
   services.
   The creation and configuration of these VPLS networks has still not
   been standardized, although several Auto discovery approaches have been
   suggested. Some require an external RADIUS server as [RADIUS]
   describes, and some use an expensive provisioning system. Others execute
   the Auto discovery by using unsolicited LDP signaling as described in
   [VPLS DISCOVER] and [VHLS DISCOVER] drafts.  This document describes a
   method for VPLS PE node Auto discovery using IGP protocols (such as
   OSPF and ISIS) link-state advertisements (LSA) mechanism, and service
   discovery using targeted-LDP.
   
   The new IGP LSA includes information on the PE router service
   capabilities. Optional additional information enables VPLS services to
   be part of 32 service groups in order to reduce the number of MPLS
   tunnels and targeted LDP sessions.
   
   Based on the IGP LSA information, targeted-LDP sessions are set for
   service discovery and MPLS tunnels are built between all the VPLS PE
   routers within the same group.
   This method enable carriers to use any desired MPLS signaling protocol
   as RSVP-TE or LDP, according to the carrier requirements.

Internet Draft   draft-bergman-vpls-igp-auto-discovery-00.txt    July 2004   
   
   The service discovery can be done in several ways, this draft propose
   to use [VHLS DISCOVER] Service discovery. In [VHLS DISCOVER], address
   messages in targeted LDP sessions are used to advertise the VPLS
   services.
   
   Other VPLS service discovery methods can also use the VPLS nodes
   discovery that is described in this memo.
   
6. VPLS discovery procedure

6.1. VPLS auto discovery procedure overview
   
     - Discover the VPLS PE routers using OSPF [OPAQUE LSA] and create
       the VPLS capable PE routers list.
     - Build MPLS LSP tunnels to all the PE routers in the list,according
       according to the advertised VPLS protocol capabilities.
     - Use the list to create targeted-LDP sessions for VPLS services
       discovery.
     - Use the VPLS services discovery to build VC PWE connections to
       each supported service.

6.2. Node Discovery Using IGP protocol

   Since MPLS is using an IGP protocol to create the network topology and
   find all the PE routers, it can also be used to find which PE router
   supports VPLS and what capabilities are available in each router. This
   memo explains in more details how OSPF [OPAQUE LSA] option can be used
   for this purpose. The same principle can be applied when using ISIS,
   and it will be described in a future release of this memo.
   
6.2.1. OSPF VPLS PE Node Opaque LSA Format
   
   Using OSPF Opaque LSA to discover VPLS PE routers can be done by defining
   a new type of LSA or using an existing LSA with an additional
   Type/Length/Value (TLV) type, both options are valid. This Memo suggest the
   use of a new Opaque LSA type, however the existing Traffic Engineering (TE)
   Opaque LSA defined in [OSPF-TE] or the Router Information Opaque LSA
   defined in [OSPF-CAP], can be also used with an additional TLV type for
   VPLS PE router.
   
6.2.2. LSA type
   
   This extension makes use of the OSPF Opaque LSA.
   
   Three types of Opaque LSAs exist, each of which has a different flooding
   scope. This proposal uses only Type 10 LSAs, which have an area flooding
   scope.
   A new LSA type needs to be defined (subject to IANA approval), VPLS PE
   node LSA. This LSA describes VPLS PE routers and advertises their
   capabilities.

6.2.3. LSA ID
   
   The LSA ID of an Opaque LSA is defined as having eight bits of type data
   and 24 bits of type-specific data.  The VPLS PE node LSA will use a previously 
   un-used type, which could currently be 5 (subject to IANA approval).
   The remaining 24 bits are the Instance field, as follows:

   The Instance field is an arbitrary value used to maintain multiple VPLS PE
   node LSAs.  A maximum of 16777216 VPLS PE node LSAs may be sourced by a

   providing different grades of service.  Note that a node may have
   multiple service instances, in which case it will advertise multiple
   Service Capabilities TLVs.  Note also that in the case of VPLS, one
   service instance may contain multiple VPLS services.
   This field must have a value of 0 when advertising a VHLS capable
   PE node.

   VPLS Group bitmap mask. This field is a 32 bits bitmap mask of VPLS
   groups. Each bit of the 32 indicates wether or not a VPLS service
   belonging to the corresponding group is configured on the advertising
   router.
   
   This bitmap optimizes the VPLS service discovery and connections mesh.
   Each VPLS router will negotiate the VPLS services only with other routers
   that have the same bit set in the VPLS Group bitmap.
   
   This field in combination with other capabilities fields can be used for
   discovery of other common services such as LDP Proxy server or client.

   - Service Parameters:
   
   Optional Service Parameters.  Some service types may have
   additional parameters that must be discovered for correct operation
   of the service. This field is not required for VPLS.  Note that for a
   given service type and instance a node will only advertise one
   Service Capabilities TLV, with one set of Service Parameters.

6.3. Node Auto discovery procedure
   
   Each VPLS capable PE router MUST advertise a VPLS PE node [OPAQUE LSA]
   with exactly one VPLS router-id TLV for each pair of <service-type,
   service-instance> configured on it.
   
   The advertising router MAY include the VPLS Group bitmap mask in the VPLS
   router-id TLV, in which case it MUST set the G bit in the Control Flags.
   
   Upon every configuration change, which changes the data in any of the VPLS
   PE node LSAs advertised by a PE router, the router MUST regenerate the LSA
   with the new data.
   
   Whenever a <service-type, service-instance> pair ceases to be configured
   on the router, the router MUST withdraw the corresponding VPLS PE node
   LSA.
   
   Upon receiving the VPLS information from another VPLS PE router, a
   verification and initialization process begins.
   
   The Control Flags field of the VPLS router-id TLV is checked.
   If the (G) bit is set then the VPLS Group bitmap mask bit is in use, the
   receiving router tests if the sending router belongs to any VPLS Group to
   which the receiving router belongs.
   If the (G) flag bit is not set then the receiving router considers the
   sending router to be part of all the VPLS groups.
   
   If there is at least one group to which both routers belong, then the
   receiving PE router adds the sending router-id to a list of VPLS
   routers. Adding a router-id to a list of VPLS routers triggers the
   following:
   
   - The receiving PE router initiates the signaling of a MPLS LSP to the
     senderÆs router-id (if one doesnÆt already exist).
   - A VPLS service discovery procedure is initiated.
   
   According to the advertised MPLS protocol capabilities in the
   LSP Signaling protocol field of the TLV the receiving router
   initiates an MPLS tunnel LSP in the following order:
   
   If the RSVP-TE bit is set the PE routers will prefer it to the other LDP
   options and use RSVP-TE to setup the MPLS LSP tunnel.
   If the RSVP-TE bit is not set then the preferred option is
   LDP downstream on demand. In case this bit is set to zero then
   unsolicited LDP is used.

Internet Draft   draft-bergman-vpls-igp-auto-discovery-00.txt    July 2004   

   Note:
   It is the carrier's responsibility to make sure that all of the
   MPLS signaling protocols will have a viable path.
   
   The other process that the receiving router starts is the VPLS service
   discovery. If service discovery is performed according to [VHLS-DISCOVERY]
   the receiving router initiates a Targeted-LDP session to the sending
   router-id for this purpose. The VPLS service discovery procedure is
   described in paragraph (7.).
   
   Whenever a VPLS PE node LSA is readvertised or withdrawn, the receiving
   router initiates removal of all the services and the MPLS tunnels to the
   sender which are no longer necessary, and removes the sender form the VPLS
   routers list if they do not share a common service group anymore.
   

7. VPN and VC Auto discovery
   
7.1. LDP signaling for VPN service and VC discovery
   
     This part is described in detail in [VHLS DISCOVER]
   
7.1.1. VPN Auto Discovery
   
   The VPN service discovery uses targeted LDP peers to all the known VPLS
   PE routers that are within the same group (as discovered by IGP). A new
   address message TLV is used to advertise the VPLS services. This mechanism
   is described in [VHLS DISCOVER] paragraph 6.2
   
7.1.2. VC Label Signaling
   
   The VC Label Signaling uses targeted LDP peers and the information
   collected by the VPN service discovery. This mechanism is described in
   [VHLS DISCOVER] paragraph 6.3
   

7.2 VPN service and VC discovery using IGP additional LSA TLV
   
   An alternative way to perform the services auto discovery is to
   create another TLV type for IGP LSA that will be advertised by each PE
   router in a separate LSA that includes all the VPN services. In this
   case the only protocol that will be used for VPLS discovery will be the
   IGP which will dramatically reduce the number of targeted-LDP sessions.
   This method is especially useful for PE routers which participate only
   in a small number of services.
   
   This option may be defined in future versions of this Memo.
