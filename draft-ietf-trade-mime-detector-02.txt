Abstract

   Entities composing web pages to provide services over HTTP frequently
   have the problem of not knowing what MIME types have handlers
   installed at a user's browser.  For example, whether an IOTP or VRML
   or SET or some streaming media handler is available.  In many cases
   they would want to display different web pages or content depending
   on a MIME handler's availability.  This document summarizes
   reasonable techniques to solve this problem for most of the browsers
   actually deployed on the Internet as of early 2000.  It is intended
   to be of practical use to implementors during the period before the
   wide deployment of superior standards based techniques which may be
   developed.

INTERNET-DRAFT           MIME Handler Detection               March 2000


1. Introduction

   Entities composing web pages to provide services over [HTTP]
   frequently have the problem of not knowing what [MIME] types have
   handlers installed at a user's browser.  For example, whether an
   [IOTP] or VRML or [SET] or some streaming media handler is available.
   In many cases they would want to display different web pages or
   content depending on a MIME handler's availability.  Sending a
   response with a MIME type that is not supported frequently results in
   interrupting the flow of the user experience, browser queries as to
   what to do with the data being provided, and, of course, failure to
   provide the behavior that would have occurred had the correct MIME
   type handler been installed.

   This document describes reasonable techniques to solve this problem
   for most of the browsers actually deployed on the Internet as of
   early 2000.  It is intended to be of practical use to implementors
   during the period before the wide deployment of superior standards
   based techniques which may be developed. It is written in terms of
   determining whether a handler for application/iotp or application/x-
   iotp exists but is equally applicable to other MIME types.



2. The HTTP 'Accept' Header

   The problem should be solved by the Hyper Text Transport Protocol
   [HTTP] request "Accept" header which lists accepted [MIME] types.
   This header is present in both Version 1.0 and 1.1 of HTTP and its
   content is supposed to be a list of MIME types and subtypes that are
   accepted.  The only problem is that many browsers just send "*/*" or
   the like.

   If the particular MIME type you are looking for is present in the
   Accept header, it is generally safe to assume that some specific
   handler for it is actually installed or part of the browser.

   NOTE: Although not part of the main topic of this document, if you
   are designing MIME type handler software and have access to a browser
   interface that allows you to request the insertion of the MIME type
   or types your software handles into the Accept header, you generally
   should do so.  It will make it easier for servers sensitive to that
   MIME type to respond correctly.



3. JavaScript

   Most recent browsers support one or more scripting languages of which
   the most widely deployed is "JavaScript".  These scripting languages


D. Eastlake, C. Smith, D. Soroka                                [Page 3]


INTERNET-DRAFT           MIME Handler Detection               March 2000


   appear in web pages and permit the interpretive execution of
   programing language constructs that can probe the browser
   environment, conditionally cause different page contents to be
   displayed, etc.  For example, Appendix A shows JavaScript available
   from the Netscape web site for determining what operating system,
   browser, and version you are running on.

   NOTE: JavaScript is a trademark of SUN Microsystems, Inc.  It was
   originally called LiveScript.  It has nothing to do with the Java
   language.

   The syntax for script use appears to be a Hyper Text Markup Language
   (HTML) comment so that bowsers that do not support scripting will
   ignore such items.  That is, script use if preceeded by "<!--" and
   terminated by "-->".  The following is a simple example of
   conditional execution of parts of a web page based on JavaScript MIME
   type handler detection.

   <SCRIPT LANGUAGE=JAVASCRIPT>
   <!-- hide it
   if (navigator.appName=="netscape") {  // wise precaution
     if ( navigator.mimeTypes["application/iotp"] ||
          navigator.mimeTypes["application/x-iotp"]) {
       // here if IOTP handler exists
       }
     else {
       // here if IOTP handler does not exist
       }
     }
   // end and hide -->
   </SCRIPT>



4. Microsoft ActiveX and the Windows Registry

   If running on Internet Explorer version 3 or 4, it is necessary to
   query to Windows Registry to determine local MIME type support.
   Although these broswers support JavaScript, in v3 the mimeTypes array
   is not present and in v4 the mimeTypes array is present but always
   empty.  For example, executing the following code will test for
   support of the IOTP types:

   CString iotpString, xiotpString;
   char* Key, Keyx;

      int rc, rcx;
      iotpString =
   "SOFTWARE\Classes\MIME\Database\Content Type\application/iotp";
      xiotpString =
   "SOFTWARE\Classes\MIME\Database\Content Type\application/x-iotp";
      Key = iotpString.GetBuffer(1);
      Keyx = xiotpString.GetBuffer(1);
      rc = RegOpenKeyEx(HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, Key, 0, KEY_READ, hDefKey);
      rcx = RegOpenKeyEx(HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, Key, 0, KEY_READ, hDefKey);
   if ( ( rc  == ERROR_SUCCESS ) || ( rcx == ERROR_SUCCESS ) )
    {
    // IOTP Handler exists
    }
   else
    {
    // No IOTP Handler
    }

   NOTE: ActiveX is a trademark of Microsoft and was originally called
   Sweeper.

5. ECML, The Electronic Commerce Modeling Language

   A industry group has recently proposed a standard for fields used in
   electronic commerce.  This fields allow "wallet" software acting for
   the consumer to convey standardized information to a merchant,
   including information as to what payment related protocols are
   supported at the customer site.  See [ECML].



6. Putting It All Together

   The following diagram indicates how these techniques can be put
   together.

7. Future Development

   Active work is proceeding in the IETF, World Wide Web Consortium
   [W3C], and Electronic Commerce Modeling Language Alliance [ECML]
   concerning content and capabilities negotiation.  This work is likely
   to lead to superior methods to implement the functionality described
   herein.  However, near universal deployment of such new
   standards/features will take some time.  Thus you should expect the
   methods given herein to be obsoleted, but perhaps not for some years.



8. Security Considerations

   It should be noted that the variety of ActiveX control suggested
   above is reading the user's registry, that is, examining their
   computer and reporting back some information it has discovered.  This
   may be a concern among some users.

   In general, the use of JavaScript even more so ActiveX is dangerous
   because they are so powerful.  JavaScript or ActiveX from a web page

   could be invisibly damaging to the client.

   Security of web interactions is normally provided by adopting channel
   encryption on the browser to server connections, such as [TLS].  In
   the absence of some such additional security outside of HTTP,
   requests and/or responses may be forged or tampered with.



9. IANA Considerations

   None specific to the techniques described herein.  For MIME types and
   type registration procedures, see [MIME: RFCs 2046, 2048].
