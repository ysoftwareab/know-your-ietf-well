1. Introduction 

   The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection protocol [BFD] provides a 
   mechanism for liveness detection of arbitrary paths between systems. 
   It is intended to provide low-overhead, short-duration detection of 
   failures in the path between adjacent forwarding engines, including 
   the interfaces, data link(s), and to the extent possible the 
   forwarding engines themselves.  

   BFD could be used in many scenarios for failure detection, which 
   includes one-hop [BFD-1HOP], multi-hop [BFD-MULTI], MPLS LSP [BFD-
   MPLS], PW VCCV [BFD-VCCV] failure detection. And according to 
   different requirements and situations, BFD provides several 
   combinations of one of those two operating modes (Asynchronous mode 
   and Demand mode) and an additional function (Echo Function) for 
   selection.

   BFD is designed for failure detection, and so far, most of the 
   applications of BFD are for liveness detection. Based on the 
   mechanisms and functions provided by BFD, BFD could be used for 
   Performance Measurement of arbitrary paths between systems. In this 
   document, the performance is specified to packet loss, packet delay 
   and packet delay variation. This document describes methods and BFD 
   extensions for using in Performance Measurement. 

2. Motivations 

   Currently, more and more new real-time services (e.g. Voice, Video, 
   Multimedia etc.) are provided based on IP/MPLS network, these new 
   applications have diverse Quality of Service (QoS) requirements that 
   are significantly different from the traditional best-effort service. 
   With the rapid growth of the network and new applications, it brings 
   a serious challenge to IP/MPLS network for performance management 
   and monitoring, which is crucial for IP/MPLS service provider to 
   provide guaranteed services, as well as for users to know that they 
   are served as Services Level Agreements (SLAs) stated on the 
   contract.  

   The requirements of Performance Measurement are stated in [Y.1541], 
   [Y.1710], [RFC 4377], [MPLS-TP-OAM-REQ] and other documents. Packet 
   loss, delay and delay variation are the most typical performance 
   metrics. By measuring these metrics of the correlative paths in a 
   network, service providers could detect the performance degradation 
   as soon as possible and take actions pre-actively. A feasible OAM 
   tool with Performance Measurement could also be used for assisting 
   in failure location when a failure occurs in a large and complex 
   network.  

   The requirements of Performance Measurement could be summed up as 
   follows:  

     o Performance Measurement SHOULD at least include packet loss, 
        packet delay and packet delay variation. 

     o For packet loss measurement, 

             - it SHOULD support dual-ended and single-ended mode, and 

             - for dual-ended, it SHOULD support pro-active measurement 
               that refers to the measuring actions which are carried 
               out continuously to permit proactive reporting of 
               performance results, and support Near-End and Far-End as 
               well;

Internet-Draft          BFD extensions for PM             October 2008 
    

             - for single-ended, it SHOULD support on-demand 
               measurement that refers to the measuring actions which 
               are initiated via manual intervention for a limited time 
               to carry out diagnostics, as well as Near-End and Far-
               End mode; 

     oFor packet delay and delay variation, 

             - it SHOULD support on-demand mode, and  

             - it SHOULD support one-way and two-way mode,  

   Currently, there are some private implements and they are almost 
   impossible to inter-operate each other, so a universal and standard 
   mechanism is desired. In this document, BFD is proposed for 
   Performance Measurement, that because BFD has the following 
   characteristics which could satisfy the requirements of Performance 
   Measurement as above: 

   BFD is a simple ''hello'' like protocol, for its lower-overhead and 
   efficient in failure detection, it is widely deployed. BFD could 
   detect failures in 10s milliseconds. If BFD is used for Performance 
   Measurement, it could improve the efficient and accuracy of 
   Performance Measurement.  

   BFD defines two operating modes, which are referred to as 
   Asynchronous and Demand mode. These two modes could be exactly used 
   to fulfill the requirements of Performance Measurement, which are 
   required to support proactive and on-demand, one-way and two-way, as 
   well as single-ended and dual-ended. So, BFD is applicable to be 
   used for Performance Measurement. The detailed definitions and 
   procedures are discussed in the following sections.  

3. Extensions to BFD 

   The BFD control packet is consisted of a Mandatory section and an 
   Optional Authentication Section, which is defined in [BFD]. The 
   Authentication Section is actually a Type-Length-Value (TLV) 
   structure that is indicated by the A (Authentication present) bit 
   whether the Authentication Section exists. There are five 
   Authentication TLVs that are defined in [BFD] and each of them is 
   identified by the Auth Type.  

   In this document, two new TLVs, which are referred to as Packet Loss 
   TLV and Packet Delay TLV, are added to the Optional Section of BFD

   control packet for packet loss, delay and delay variation 
   measurement.  

   Currently, the Optional Section is defined only for Authentication 
   function. In case of Performance Measurement TLVs defined in this 
   document could be carried in the Optional Section, this document 
   proposes to change the special A bit to a common O (Optional Section 
   present) bit. Then, if the Optional Section needs to be included in 
   the BFD control packet, the O bit SHOULD be set and indicate that 
   there are some optional data SHOULD be processed. Such changes will 
   not bring essential impact to the processing of the existing 
   Authentication function, because the process of Authentication TLVs 
   is the same as the [BFD] defined other than the semantic of the 
   ''old'' A bit. 

3.1. Packet Loss TLV 

   To perform packet loss measurement of a specific path, whatever each 
   of the two ends calculates the ratio of packet loss, it gets to know 
   the number of not only sent packet at the sender, but received 
   packet at the receiver in a certain measure period. And there is 
   another big issue that the receiver has to be aware of the right 
   time when to start and stop counting for a specific measurement. 

   In this document, the Packet Loss TLV is defined for a sender to 
   notify the receiver when to start and stop counting, with such 
   mechanism, time synchronization is not necessary. And some essential 
   statistic information (e.g. the number of transmitted, the number of 
   received) for ratio calculation of packet loss are carried in the 
   Packet Loss TLV, which could be used by each of the two ends of a 
   specific path to calculates the loss ratio. The format of the Packet 
   Loss TLV is as follows:

   The Packet Loss TLV is TLV type 6 (which needs to be confirmed by 
   IANA see Section 6), and is 12 bytes in length, the value of length 
   includes the Type and Length field.  

   The Sequence field specifies the sequence number of a BFD Packet 
   Loss Measurement (PLM) packet. It is generated by the end who 
   initiates the measurement, the middle nodes and other side MUST not 
   change the sequence number when propagate or reply the PLM packet. 
   The sequence number could be used for loss detection of PLM packets 
   or for the initiator to make sure the received PLM packet is a 
   response of a previous PLM packet sent by itself.  

   The TxPacCount_l contains the local counter of the transmitted 
   packets from the beginning of this measurement to the time when 
   sending this BFD PLM packet.  

   The RxPacCount_l contains the local counter of the received packets 
   from the beginning of this measurement to the time when received a 
   BFD PLM packet.  

   The TxPacCount_f is copied from the TxPacCount_l of the last 
   received BFD PLM packet when needs to reply a received BFD PLM 
   packet with the statistic information back to initiator of this 
   measurement for packet loss ratio calculation.

   The detailed procedures on how to use the Packet Loss TLV in 
   different scenarios for packet loss measurement are described in 
   Section 4 of this document.  

3.2. Packet Delay TLV 

   The Packet Delay TLV is defined for packet delay and delay variation 
   measurement. The Packet Delay TLV is TLV type 7 (which needs to be 
   confirmed by IANA see Section 6), and is 12 bytes in length, the 
   value of length includes the Type and Length field. The format of 
   the Packet Delay TLV is as follows:

   The Sequence field specifies the sequence number of a BFD Packet 
   Delay Measurement (PDM) packet. It is generated by the end who 
   initiates the measurement, the middle nodes and other side MUST not 
   change the sequence number when propagate or reply the PDM packet. 
   The sequence number could be used for PDM packets loss detection or 
   for the initiator to make sure the received PDM packet is a response 
   of a previous PDM packet sent by itself.  

   TxTimeStamp_a specifies the time stamp of the Active_End when 
   transmitting a BFD Packet Delay Measurement (PDM) request packet. 

   RxTimeStamp_p specifies the time stamp of the Passive_End when 
   receiving a BFD PDM request packet. 

   TxTimeStamp_p specifies the time stamp of the passive end when 
   transmitting the BFD PDM reply packet to a previous BFD PDM request 
   packet.

   Active_End is the node that initiates the measurement, Passive_End 
   is the node that will not initiate a measurement and just act to, if 
   needed, the Active_End when received a PDM request packet.  

   The detailed procedures on how to use the Packet Delay TLV in 
   different scenarios for packet delay and delay variation measurement 
   are described in Section 4 of this document. 

4. Theory of Operation 

   BFD defines two different operating modes, which are known as 
   Asynchronous mode and Demand mode. 

   With asynchronous mode, the systems periodically send BFD Control 
   packets to one another, and each system judges and declares the 
   session down independently if a number of those packets in a row are 
   not received. The Asynchronous mode may be used to achieve a pro-
   active Performance Measurement that can be carried out continuously 
   to permit proactive reporting of performance results.  

   For demand mode, once a BFD session is established, the two systems 
   will stop sending BFD Control packets, except when the system feels 
   the need to verify connectivity explicitly. Demand mode may operate 
   independently in each direction, or simultaneously. The BFD demand 
   mode may be used to support an on-demand Performance Measurement 
   mechanism. 

4.1. Packet Loss Measurement 

   In this document, BFD control packets are used to carry the counter 
   values that are the numbers of packets transmitted and received for 
   a specific measurement between the two systems for packet loss 
   measurement. 

   Packet loss measurement is independent on clock/time synchronization 
   of the two systems. It is by sending BFD control packets with PLM 
   TLV carrying statistics of the transmitted and/or received packets 
   to each other, depends on the real situation, the operators could 
   choose any side of the two systems for packet loss ratio calculation, 
   which results in several measurement modes/methods as described 
   below for selection.   

   Near-end PLM is to measure the loss of packet sending from the far 
   end, and on the contrary, the for-end PLM is to measure the loss of 
   packet sending by this self end.

   For the difference of operation, Packet loss measurement may be 
   performed in two modes, dual-ended PLM and single-ended PLM.

               Figure 3: Dual-ended near-end Packet lost measurement 

   Dual-ended PLM is the mode that each end independently sends 
   periodic BFD PLM packets to the other end, the end who receives the 
   PLM packets will perform packet loss ratio calculation. Dual-ended 
   PLM can be used as a pro-active measurement mode. For dual-ended PLM, 
   it is expected to support two measurements that are referred to as 
   Near-end and Far-end. Near-end PLM is intended to measure the packet 
   loss sending from the other ends, and on the contrary, Far-end PLM 
   means that the node performs packet loss calculation for the packets 
   sending by itself.  

   Figure 3 describes the flow of Near-end packet loss measurement, 
   where A is the node who initiates the packet loss measurement and B 
   is the node who is responsible for packet loss ratio calculation, 
   and vice versa. 

   When dual-ended PLM is enabled, if node B is configured to support 
   near-end PLM, A will send periodic BFD PLM packet to B, and start 
   counting the sending packets. The BFD PLM packets carry the PLM TLV, 
   in which the parameters TxPacCount_l and sequence will be included. 
   For near-end measurement, the other two parameters, RxPacCount_l and

   TxPacCount_f, are not needed and should be ignored on receipt, the 
   two fields MUST be set to zero when transmitting. When received a 
   PLM packet, node B will read and record the value of local received 
   packet counter(LRPC), which mantains the numbers of the received 
   packets, as well the parameter TxPacCount_l from the received PLM 
   packet. Using the parameters this time and the previous, B node can 
   perform near-end packet loss measurement. Presuming that Tn1 and Tn2 
   are the time of A node sending two different PLM packets, and TTn1 
   and TTn2 are correspondingly the time of the two PLM packets 
   received by the B node. The formula is as follow. The calculation

           Figure 4: Dual-ended far-end Packet lost measurement 

   Figure 4 describes the flow of far-end packet loss measurement. Node 
   A sends PLM packets to node B and performs the calculation of packet 
   loss for these packets sending by itself.  

   When dual-ended PLM is enabled, and A is configured to support far-
   ended PLM measurement, the same as near-ended PLM, A will send 
   periodic BFD PLM packet with the TxPacCount_l and sequence 
   parameters set to node B. The difference is that, the B node SHOULD 
   also send periodic BFD PLM packets to A, with parameters 
   RxPacCount_l and TxPacCount_f that specify the value of local

   received packet counter (LRPC) and the value of TxPacCount_l which 
   is carried in a previous PLM packet received from node A. The same 
   as near-end packet loss measurement, when received a PLM packet form 
   B node, node A will record the parameters from the PLM packet and 
   read the value of LRPC, then using parameters of this time and the 
   previous, node A will perform far-end packet loss calculation. Tn1 
   and Tn2 specify the time of two difference PLM packets sending form 
   A, and TTn1 and TTn2 are the corresponding time of B received these 
   two packets. The formula of calculation is as follow.                    

   Packet Loss [far-end]=|TxPacCount_f[Tn2] -TxPacCount_f[Tn1]| -
    |RxPacCount_l[TTn2] - RxPacCount_l[TTn1]|   

   Near-end and Far-end could be enabled at the same time in one node.

           Figure 5: Single-ended Packet loss measurement 
 

   Single-ended means that the side touches off the measurement and 
   will perform the packet loss calculation by itself, which implies 
   that the other side should send the packets statistics of the 
   measurement back to the initiator. 

   Single-ended PLM can be used as an on-demand measurement mode. Once 
   this mode is enabled, the active system sends BFD PLM request packet

   with the PLM TLV to its peer, and receives the BFD PLM reply packet 
   from the peer, then performs packet loss calculation. BFD demand 
   mode is applicable for being used to support Single-ended PLM. 

   The flow of single-ended Packet Loss Measurement is described as 
   Figure 5. Node A is the active system which by sending the BFD PLM 
   request packet to node B to initiate a specific packet loss 
   measurement. Node B is the passive node that will send PLM reply 
   packet back to node A when received a PLM request packet.   

   The same as Dual-ended packet loss measurement, Single-ended PLM is 
   also expected to support Near-end and Far-end measurement. When 
   Single-ended PLM is enabled on node A, it will initiate a specific 
   measurement by sending BFD PLM request packets to node B. For Far-
   end PLM, the TxPacCount_l containing the number of transmitted 
   packets MUST be included in the PLM TLV. When a specific measurement 
   started, the node starts to count the transmitted and received 
   packets. When received a PLM request packet, node B will send A the 
   PLM reply packet with the PLM TLV containing the three counters 
   TxPacCount_l, RxPacCount_l and TxPacCount_f, and the sequence copied 
   from a previous PLM request packet. TxPacCount_f is identical to 
   TxPacCount_l of the last received PLM request packet. When doing 
   Near-end PLM, TxPacCount_l MUST be included in the PLM TLV and the 
   other two counter are not necessary and should be set to zero. For 
   Far-end PLM, RxPacCount_l and TxPacCount_f MUST be included and the 
   other counter TxPacCount_l is not necessary and should be set to 
   zero. When Near-end and Far-end PLM are expected to be supported at 
   the same time, the three counters MUST be included. When node A 
   receives a PLM reply packet,it will read and record the counters 
   from the PLM reply packet, as well the value of local packet 
   reception counter. Based on the counters from any twice records 
   which may be continuous or not, node A can perform packet loss 
   calculation of the period.  

   Tn1 and Tn2 specify the time of two difference PLM request packets 
   sending from A, and TTn1 and TTn2 are the corresponding time of B 
   received these two packets. 

   The formulas of Near-end and Far-end are as follows. 

   Packet Loss [near-end]=|TxPacCount_l[Tn2] -TxPacCount_l[Tn1]| - 
   |RxPacCountl[TTn2] - RxPacCountl[TTn1]|   

   Packet Loss [far-end]=|TxPacCount_f[Tn2] -TxPacCount_f[Tn1]| - 
   |RxPacCount_l[TTn2] - RxPacCount_l[TTn1]|

   The formulas below are for packet loss ratio: 

   Packet Loss Ratio[near-end] = (Packet Loss[near-end] 
   /(|TxPacCount_l[Tn2] -TxPacCount_l[Tn1]|)) *100% 

   Packet Loss Ratio[far-end] = (Packet Loss[far-end] 
   /(|TxPacCount_f[Tn2] -TxPacCount_f[Tn1]|)) *100% 

4.2. Packet Delay Measurement 

   Packet delay measurement can be used for on-demand Performance 
   Measurement. In this document, BFD control packets with PDM TLV 
   containing the timestamps of sending and receiving PDM packet 
   between the two systems are used to perform packet delay and delay 
   variation measurement. Packet delay measurement is performed by 
   sending periodic BFD PDM packets from one system to another, and two 
   modes that are referred to as one-way and two-way delay measurement 
   are defined to be applied for different situations.

               Figure 6: One-Way Packet Delay measurement 

   In one-way mode, one system sends BFD PDM packet carrying the local 
   timestamp to facilitate packet delay measurement on the other end.

   Both BFD demand mode or asynchronous mode are applicable for one-way 
   delay measurement. Figure 6 describes the flow of One-way PDM.  

   When One-way packet delay measurement is enabled, the active node A 
   will transmit BFD PDM packets with the PDM TLV, in which the 
   TxTimeStamp_a and sequence MUST be included. When received a PDM 
   packet, according to the TxTimeStamp_a from the received PDM packet 
   and the local timestamp, node B could perform packet delay 
   calculation. The formula is as follows.  

   Packet Delay [one-way] = RxTime_a - TxTimeStamp_a   

   RxTime_a is the local timestamp of node B when receiving the PDM 
   packet. If the time difference Delta_t of the two ends is already 
   known, the calculation formula could be as follows. 

   Packet Delay [one-way] = RxTime_a - TxTimeStamp_a + Delta_t 

   For one-way PDM being dependent on the synchronization of clock/time 
   between the two systems, the synchronization of clock/time is 
   desired.

               Figure 7: Two-way Packet Delay measurement 
 
   Two-way PDM is a request-reply mode, which one system as the active 
   end initiates the PDM request packet, the other system acts as 
   passive end will send back a PDM reply packet when received the PDM 
   request packet. Then the active end will perform two-way packet 
   delay calculation. For the characters of this mode, BFD demand mode 
   is preferred. Figure 7 describes the operation flow. 

   When two-way PDM is enabled, node A as the active end will send BFD 
   PDM request packets with Packet Delay TLV to the other end, node B. 
   The same as the one-way mode, the local timestamp TxTimeStamp_a and 
   sequence MUST be included. When node B received a BFD PDM request 
   packet, it will reply by sending a PDM reply packet with PDM TLV 
   containing the timestamp and sequence copied from of the received 
   PDM request packet.  

   Once received the PDM reply packet, node A will perform packet delay 
   calculation. The formula is as follows.  

   Packet Delay [two-way] = RxTime_a - TxTimeStamp_a 

   RxTime_a is the timestamp of the active end receiving the PDM reply 
   packet from the passive end. 

   The other two additional timestamps in the packet delay TLV, 
   RxTimeStamp_p and TxTimeStamp_p, stand for the timestamps that the

   passive end receiving the PDM request packet and sending the PDM 
   reply packet to the active end respectively, which could be used to 
   perform more precise two-way packet delay measurement. As an option, 
   if operator wants to take into account the processing time at the 
   node B, the two additional timestamps should be included in the PDM 
   reply packet by the passive end. Formula for calculation is bellow. 

   Packet Delay [two-way] = (RxTime_a - TxTimeStamp_a) - 
   (TxTimeStamp_p-RxTimeStamp_p) 

   Two-way PDM is relaxed for synchronization of clock. So if the 
   clocks are not practical to be synchronized between the two ends, 
   which may be a common scenario, two-way delay measurement mode could 
   be used.  

4.3. Packet Delay variation Measurement 

   Packet delay variation measurement is based on the difference of 
   subsequent packet delay measurement. The Packet Delay Variation is 
   relaxed for synchronization of clock and could be calculated by the 
   formulas below. 

   Frame Delay Variation[one-way] = Frame Delay2 [one-way] - Frame 
   Delay1 [one-way] 

   Frame Delay Variation[two-way] = Frame Delay2 [two-way] - Frame 
   Delay1 [two-way]
