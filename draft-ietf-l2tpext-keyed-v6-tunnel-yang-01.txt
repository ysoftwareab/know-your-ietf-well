                A YANG Data Model for Keyed IPv6 Tunnels
               draft-ietf-l2tpext-keyed-v6-tunnel-yang-01

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG data model for the configuration and
   management of Keyed IPv6 tunnels.  The data model includes both
   configuration and state data.  Due to the stateless nature of keyed
   IPv6 tunnels, a model for NETCONF notifications is not necessary.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.  Introduction

   Keyed IPv6 Tunnels [I-D.ietf-l2tpext-keyed-ipv6-tunnel] defines a
   mechanism for transporting L2 Ethernet frames over IPv6 using L2TPv3
   tunnel encapsulation with a mandatory 64-bit cookie.  It is a static
   layer 2 tunnelling mechanism that leverages IPv6's vast number of IP
   addresses to uniquely identify each tunnel, instead of using the
   L2TPv3 Session ID as the differentiator (as defined in [RFC3931]).
   The layer 2 circuit is mapped to an IPv6 address on the network side
   so typically, there is one session per-tunnel.

   Since the L2TPv3 control plane is not used by Keyed IPv6 tunnels, the
   parameters for building a Keyed IPv6 tunnel need to be pre-configured
   on the two tunnel endpoint devices.  NETCONF [RFC6241]/YANG [RFC6020]
   provide mechanisms for such configuration.  This document defines a
   YANG data model for the configuration and management of Keyed IPv6
   Tunnels.

1.1.  Terminology

1.1.1.  Requirements Notations

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.1.2.  NETCONF Terms

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6241] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  Client

   o  Server

   o  Operation

1.1.3.  YANG Terms

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6020] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  configuration data

   o  data node

   o  data tree

   o  module

   o  namespace

   o  YANG

1.1.4.  Tree Diagrams

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is provided
   in this document.  The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is as
   follows:

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      data (read-write), and "ro" means state data (read-only).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!"

Internet-Draft              YANG for softwire                 March 2016


      means a presence container, and "*" denotes a list and leaf-list.

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for the contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

2.  YANG Model Overview

   The YANG model comprises of two modules, one for configuration and
   one for state.  To correctly identify a tunnel and create the mapping
   between the L2 circuit and the IPv6 address, the tuple of source
   interface, local IPv6 address and remote IPv6 address MUST be unique.
   Because Session ID is not mandatory for a Keyed IPv6 tunnel to
   function, Session ID related parameters are optional in the model.
   Cookies MUST be 64-bit long according to the Section 3 of
   [I-D.ietf-l2tpext-keyed-ipv6-tunnel].  The requirement for 64-bit
   cookie constrains interoperability with existing RFC3931
   implementations to those configured with a 64-bit cookie.

   The data model also includes read-only counters so that statistics
   for sent and received octets and packets, received packets with
   errors, and packets that could not be sent due to errors can be read.

   This model defines three features for OAM parameters.  Those features
   enable devices to perform related OAM operations on the tunnel if
   related functions are supported.

                     Figure 1: Keyed IPv6 Tunnel Tree

   The data model defines a configuration container and a state
   container.

   In the configuration container, "srcInterface" is used to identify a
   L2 circuit endpoint. "localIPv6" and "remoteIPv6" respectively hold
   the local (source) and remote (destination) IPv6 addresses for the
   tunnel.  The tuple of srcInterface and localIPv6 uniquely identify a
   tunnel endpoint.  If a virtual interface is used, the tuple of
   localIPv6 and remoteIPv6 MUST also be unique. "localCookie" is a list
   containing two cookies: one is the newly configured cookie, and the
   other is previously configured.  This is used for the purpose of
   correctly receiving packets while changing cookies.

   Nodes are defined for FCS-Retention, VCCV, BFD, VCCV-BFD and
   fragmentation, so that devices supporting all or some of these
   features can be configured.

5.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this memo is designed to be accessed via
   the NETCONF protocol [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the
   secure transport layer and the mandatory to implement secure
   transport is SSH [RFC6242].  The NETCONF access control model
   [RFC6536] provides the means to restrict access for particular
   NETCONF users to a pre-configured subset of all available NETCONF
   protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module which
   are writable/creatable/deletable (i.e. config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g. edit-config) to
   these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect
   on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes and
   their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   /tunnelConfigurations/tunnelConfiguration: Could allow traffic to be
   redirected, (man-in-the-middle attack) or mis-configured (denial-of-
   service attack).

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g. via get, get-config or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   /tunnelConfigurations/tunnelConfiguration: Could allow an attacker to
   inject spoofed traffic into the network.

   /tunnelStates/tunnelState: Could allow an attacker to get
   unauthorized access to tunnel usage information.

6.  IANA Considerations

   TBD
