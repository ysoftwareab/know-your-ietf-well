3. Introduction 
 
   This document provides an analysis grid to evaluate, compare and 
   contrast the Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) protocol suite capabilities 
   with respect to the recovery mechanisms proposed at the IETF CCAMP 
   Working Group. The focus is on transport plane survivability and 
   recovery issues and not on control plane resilience related aspects. 
   Although the recovery mechanisms described in this document impose 
   different requirements on GMPLS-based recovery protocols, the 
   protocol(s) specifications will not be covered in this document. 
   Though the concepts discussed are technology independent, this 
   document implicitly focuses on SONET [T1.105]/SDH [G.707], Optical 
   Transport Networks (OTN) [G.709] and pre-OTN technologies except 
   when specific details need to be considered (for instance, in the 
   case of failure detection).  
 
   A detailed analysis is provided for each of the recovery phases as 
   identified in [TERM]. These phases define the sequence of generic 
   operations that need to be performed when a LSP/Span failure (or any 
   other event generating such failures) occurs:  
    
      - Phase 1: Failure detection 
      - Phase 2: Failure localization and isolation 
      - Phase 3: Failure notification  
      - Phase 4: Recovery (Protection/Restoration)  
      - Phase 5: Reversion (normalization) 
    
   Failure detection, localization and notification phases together are 
   referred to as fault management. Within a recovery domain, the 
   entities involved during the recovery operations are defined in 
   [TERM]; these entities include ingress, egress and intermediate 
   nodes. The term "recovery mechanism" is used to cover both 
   protection and restoration mechanisms. Specific terms such as 
   protection and restoration are only used when differentiation is 
   required. Likewise the term "failure" is used to represent both 
   signal failure and signal degradation.  
    
   In addition, a clear distinction is made between partitioning 
   (horizontal hierarchy) and layering (vertical hierarchy) when 
   analyzing the different hierarchical recovery mechanisms including 
   disjointness related issues. The dimensions from which each of the 
   recovery mechanisms detailed in this document can be analyzed are

   introduced to assess the current GMPLS protocol capabilities and the 
   potential need for further extensions. This document concludes by 
   detailing the applicability of the current GMPLS protocol building 
   blocks for recovery purposes. 
 
4. Fault Management 
    
4.1 Failure Detection 
    
   Transport failure detection is the only phase that can not be 
   achieved by the control plane alone since the latter needs a hook to 
   the transport plane to collect the related information. It has to be 
   emphasized that even if failure events themselves are detected by 
   the transport plane, the latter, upon a failure condition, must 
   trigger the control plane for subsequent actions through the use of 
   GMPLS signalling capabilities (see [RFC3471] and [RFC3473]) or Link 
   Management Protocol capabilities (see [LMP], Section 6). 
    
   Therefore, by definition, transport failure detection is transport 
   technology dependent (and so exceptionally, we keep here the 
   "transport plane" terminology). In transport fault management, 
   distinction is made between a defect and a failure. Here, the 
   discussion addresses failure detection (persistent fault cause). In 
   the technology-dependent descriptions, a more precise specification 
   will be provided. 
    
   As an example, SONET/SDH (see [G.707], [G.783] and [G.806]) provides 
   supervision capabilities covering:  
    
   - Continuity: monitors the integrity of the continuity of a trail  
     (i.e. section or path). This operation is performed by monitoring    
     the presence/absence of the signal. Examples are Loss of Signal  
     (LOS) detection for the physical layer, Unequipped (UNEQ) Signal  
     detection for the path layer, Server Signal Fail Detection (e.g.  
     AIS) at the client layer.  
    
   - Connectivity: monitors the integrity of the routing of the signal  
     between end-points. Connectivity monitoring is needed if  
     the layer provides flexible connectivity, either automatically  
     (e.g. cross-connects) or manually (e.g. fiber distribution frame).  
     An example is the Trail (i.e. section or path) Trace Identifier  
     used at the different layers and the corresponding Trail Trace  
     Identifier Mismatch detection. 
 
   - Alignment: checks that the client and server layer frame start can  
     be correctly recovered from the detection of loss of alignment.  
     The specific processes depend on the signal/frame structure and  
     may include: (multi-)frame alignment, pointer processing and  
     alignment of several independent frames to a common frame start in  
     case of inverse multiplexing. Loss of alignment is a generic term.  
     Examples are loss of frame, loss of multi-frame, or loss of  
     pointer.

   - Payload type: checks that compatible adaptation functions are used  
     at the source and the destination. This is normally done by adding  
     a payload type identifier (referred to as the "signal label") at  
     the source adaptation function and comparing it with the expected  
     identifier at the destination. For instance, the payload type  
     identifier and the corresponding mismatch detection. 
    
    
   - Signal Quality: monitors the performance of a signal. For  
     instance, if the performance falls below a certain threshold a  
     defect - excessive errors (EXC) or degraded signal (DEG) - is  
     detected. 
    
   The most important point is that the supervision processes and the 
   corresponding failure detection (used to initiate the recovery 
   phase(s)) result in either: 
    
   - Signal Degrade (SD): A signal indicating that the associated data  
     has degraded in the sense that a degraded defect condition is  
     active (for instance, a dDEG declared when the Bit Error Rate  
     exceeds a preset threshold). 
    
   - Signal Fail (SF): A signal indicating that the associated data has  
     failed in the sense that a signal interrupting near-end defect  
     condition is active (as opposed to the degraded defect). 
    
   In Optical Transport Networks (OTN) equivalent supervision 
   capabilities are provided at the optical/digital section layers 
   (i.e. Optical Transmission Section (OTS), Optical Multiplex Section 
   (OMS) and Optical channel Transport Unit (OTU)) and at the optical/ 
   digital path layers (i.e. Optical Channel (OCh) and Optical channel 
   Data Unit (ODU)). Interested readers are referred to the ITU-T 
   Recommendations [G.798] and [G.709] for more details. 
    
   The above are examples that illustrate cases where the failure 
   detection, and reporting entities (see [TERM]) are co-located. The 
   following example illustrates the scenario where the failure 
   detecting and reporting entities (see [TERM]) are not co-located. 
    
   In pre-OTN networks, a failure may be masked by intermediate O-E-O 
   based Optical Line System (OLS), preventing a Photonic Cross-Connect 
   (PXC) from detecting upstream failures. In such cases, failure 
   detection may be assisted by an out-of-band communication channel 
   and failure condition reported to the PXC control plane. This can be 
   provided by using [LMP-WDM] extensions that delivers IP message-
   based communication between the PXC and the OLS control plane. Also, 
   since PXCs are independent of the framing format, failure conditions 
   can only be triggered either by detecting the absence of the optical 
   signal or by measuring its quality. These mechanisms are generally 
   less reliable than electrical (digital) ones. Both types of 
   detection mechanisms are outside the scope of this document. If the 
   intermediate OLS supports electrical (digital) mechanisms, using the 
   LMP communication channel, these failure conditions are reported to

draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-recovery-analysis-05.txt             April 2005 
 
 
   the PXC and subsequent recovery actions performed as described in 
   Section 5. As such from the control plane viewpoint, this mechanism 
   turn the OLS-PXC composed system into a single logical entity 
   allowing the consideration of the same failure management mechanisms 
   for such entity as for any other O-E-O capable device.  
 
   More generally, the following are typical failure conditions in 
   SONET/SDH and pre-OTN networks: 
   - Loss of Light (LOL)/Loss of Signal (LOS): Signal Failure (SF)  
     condition where the optical signal is not detected any longer on     
     the receiver of a given interface.  
   - Signal Degrade (SD): detection of the signal degradation over  
     a specific period of time. 
   - For SONET/SDH payloads, all of the above-mentioned supervision  
     capabilities can be used, resulting in SD or SF condition. 
 
   In summary, the following cases apply when considering the 
   communication between the detecting and reporting entities: 
    
   - Co-located detecting and reporting entities: both the detecting  
     and reporting entities are on the same node (e.g., SONET/SDH  
     equipment, Opaque cross-connects, and, with some limitations,  
     Transparent cross-connects, etc.)  
    
   - Non co-located detecting and reporting entities:  
     o with in-band communication between entities: entities are  
       physically separated but the transport plane provides in-band   
       communication between them (e.g., Server Signal Failures (Alarm  
       Indication Signal (AIS)), etc.)  
     o with out-of-band communication between entities: entities are  
       physically separated but an out-of-band communication channel is  
       provided between them (e.g., using [LMP]).  
 
4.2 Failure Localization and Isolation 
 
   Failure localization provides to the deciding entity information 
   about the location (and so the identity) of the transport plane 
   entity that detects the LSP(s)/span(s) failure. The deciding entity 
   can then make an accurate decision to achieve finer grained recovery 
   switching action(s). Note that this information can also be included 
   as part of the failure notification (see Section 4.3).  
    
   In some cases, this accurate failure localization information may be 
   less urgent to determine if it requires performing more time 
   consuming failure isolation (see also Section 4.4). This is 
   particularly the case when edge-to-edge LSP recovery (edge referring 
   to a sub-network end-node for instance) is performed based on a 
   simple failure notification (including the identification of the 
   working LSPs under failure condition). In this case, a more accurate 
   localization and isolation can be performed after recovery of these 
   LSPs.

   Failure localization should be triggered immediately after the fault 
   detection phase. This operation can be performed at the transport 
   plane and/or, if unavailable (via the transport plane), the control 
   plane level where dedicated signaling messages can be used. When 
   performed at the control plane level, a protocol such as LMP (see 
   [LMP], Section 6) can be used for failure localization purposes. 
 
4.3 Failure Notification  
    
   Failure notification is used 1) to inform intermediate nodes that an 
   LSP/span failure has occurred and has been detected 2) to inform the 
   deciding entities (which can correspond to any intermediate or end-
   point of the failed LSP/span) that the corresponding service is not 
   available. In general, these deciding entities will be the ones 
   taking the appropriate recovery decision. When co-located with the 
   recovering entity, these entities will also perform the 
   corresponding recovery action(s). 
 
   Failure notification can be either provided by the transport or by 
   the control plane. As an example, let us first briefly describe the 
   failure notification mechanism defined at the SONET/SDH transport 
   plane level (also referred to as maintenance signal supervision): 
    
   - AIS (Alarm Indication Signal) occurs as a result of a failure 
     condition such as Loss of Signal and is used to notify downstream 
     nodes (of the appropriate layer processing) that a failure has   
     occurred. AIS performs two functions 1) inform the intermediate  
     nodes (with the appropriate layer monitoring capability) that a  
     failure has been detected 2) notify the connection end-point that  
     the service is no longer available.  
    
   For a distributed control plane supporting one (or more) failure 
   notification mechanism(s), regardless of the mechanism's actual 
   implementation, the same capabilities are needed with more (or less) 
   information provided about the LSPs/spans under failure condition, 
   their detailed status, etc. 
    
   The most important difference between these mechanisms is related to 
   the fact that transport plane notifications (as defined today) would 
   directly initiate either a certain type of protection switching 
   (such as those described in [TERM]) via the transport plane or 
   restoration actions via the management plane.  
    
   On the other hand, using a failure notification mechanism through 
   the control plane would provide the possibility to trigger either a 
   protection or a restoration action via the control plane. This has 
   the advantage that a control plane recovery responsible entity does 
   not necessarily have to be co-located with a transport 
   maintenance/recovery domain. A control plane recovery domain can be 
   defined at entities not supporting a transport plane recovery. 
    
   Moreover, as specified in [RFC3473], notification message exchanges 
   through a GMPLS control plane may not follow the same path as the

draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-recovery-analysis-05.txt             April 2005 
 
 
   LSP/spans for which these messages carry the status. In turn, this 
   ensures a fast, reliable (through acknowledgement and the use of 
   either a dedicated control plane network or disjoint control 
   channels) and efficient (through the aggregation of several LSP/span 
   status within the same message) failure notification mechanism.  
    
   The other important properties to be met by the failure notification 
   mechanism are mainly the following: 
     
   - Notification messages must provide enough information such that  
     the most efficient subsequent recovery action will be taken (in  
     most of the recovery types and schemes this action is even  
     deterministic) at the recovering entities. Remember here that  
     these entities can be either intermediate or end-points through  
     which normal traffic flows. Based on local policy, intermediate  
     nodes may not use this information for subsequent recovery actions  
     (see for instance the APS protocol phases as described in [TERM]).  
     In addition, since fast notification is a mechanism running in  
     collaboration with the existing GMPLS signalling (see [RFC3473])  
     that also allows intermediate nodes to stay informed about the  
     status of the working LSP/spans under failure condition.  
    
     The trade-off here is to define what information the LSP/span end- 
     points (more precisely, the deciding entity) needs in order for  
     the recovering entity to take the best recovery action: if not 
     enough information is provided, the decision can not be optimal  
     (note that in this eventuality, the important issue is to quantify  
     the level of sub-optimality), if too much information is provided  
     the control plane may be overloaded with unnecessary information  
     and the aggregation/correlation of this notification information  
     will be more complex and time consuming to achieve. Note that a 
     more detailed quantification of the amount of information to be  
     exchanged and processed is strongly dependent on the failure  
     notification protocol. 
 
   - If the failure localization and isolation is not performed by one   
     of the LSP/span end-points or some intermediate points, they  
     should receive enough information from the notification message in  
     order to locate the failure otherwise they would need to (re-)   
     initiate a failure localization and isolation action.     
    
   - Avoiding so-called notification storms implies that 1) the failure  
     detection output is correlated (i.e. alarm correlation) and  
     aggregated at the node detecting the failure(s) 2) the failure  
     notifications are directed to a restricted set of destinations (in  
     general the end-points) and that 3) failure notification  
     suppression (i.e. alarm suppression) is provided in order to limit  
     flooding in case of multiple and/or correlated failures appearing  
     at several locations in the network.  
    
   - Alarm correlation and aggregation (at the failure detecting  
     node) implies a consistent decision based on the conditions for  
     which a trade-off between fast convergence (at detecting node) and

     fast notification (implying that correlation and aggregation  
     occurs at receiving end-points) can be found. 
 
4.4 Failure Correlation 
    
   A single failure event (such as a span failure) can result into 
   reporting multiple failures (such as individual LSP failures) 
   conditions. These can be grouped (i.e. correlated) to reduce the 
   number of failure conditions communicated on the reporting channel, 
   for both in-band and out-of-band failure reporting.  
    
   In such a scenario, it can be important to wait for a certain period 
   of time, typically called failure correlation time, and gather all 
   the failures to report them as a group of failures (or simply group 
   failure). For instance, this approach can be provided using LMP-WDM 
   for pre-OTN networks (see [LMP-WDM]) or when using Signal Failure/ 
   Degrade Group in the SONET/SDH context.  
    
   Note that a default average time interval during which failure 
   correlation operation can be performed is difficult to provide since 
   it is strongly dependent on the underlying network topology. 
   Therefore, it can be advisable to provide a per-node configurable 
   failure correlation time. The detailed selection criteria for this 
   time interval are outside of the scope of this document. 
    
   When failure correlation is not provided, multiple failure 
   notification messages may be sent out in response to a single 
   failure (for instance, a fiber cut), each one containing a set of 
   information on the failed working resources (for instance, the 
   individual lambda LSP flowing through this fiber). This allows for a 
   more prompt response but can potentially overload the control plane 
   due to a large amount of failure notifications. 
 
5. Recovery Mechanisms  
    
5.1 Transport vs. Control Plane Responsibilities  
    
   For both protection and restoration, and when applicable, recovery 
   resources are provisioned using GMPLS signalling capabilities. Thus, 
   these are control plane-driven actions (topological and resource-
   constrained) that are always performed in this context.  
 
   The following tables give an overview of the responsibilities taken 
   by the control plane in case of LSP/span recovery: 
    
   1. LSP/span Protection  
    
   - Phase 1: Failure detection                 Transport plane 
   - Phase 2: Failure localization/isolation    Transport/Control plane 
   - Phase 3: Failure notification              Transport/Control plane 
   - Phase 4: Protection switching              Transport/Control plane 
   - Phase 5: Reversion (normalization)         Transport/Control plane

draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-recovery-analysis-05.txt             April 2005 
 
 
   Note: in the context of LSP/span protection, control plane actions 
   can be performed either for operational purposes and/or 
   synchronization purposes (vertical synchronization between transport 
   and control plane) and/or notification purposes (horizontal 
   synchronization between end-nodes at control plane level). This 
   suggests the selection of the responsible plane (in particular for 
   protection switching) during the provisioning phase of the 
   protected/protection LSP. 
 
   2. LSP/span Restoration  
    
   - Phase 1: Failure detection                 Transport plane 
   - Phase 2: Failure localization/isolation    Transport/Control plane 
   - Phase 3: Failure notification              Control plane 
   - Phase 4: Recovery switching                Control plane 
   - Phase 5: Reversion (normalization)         Control plane  
    
   Therefore, this document primarily focuses on provisioning of LSP 
   recovery resources, failure notification mechanisms, recovery 
   switching, and reversion operations. Moreover some additional 
   considerations can be dedicated to the mechanisms associated to the 
   failure localization/isolation phase.  
 
5.2 Technology in/dependent mechanisms  
    
   The present recovery mechanisms analysis applies in fact to any 
   circuit oriented data plane technology with discrete bandwidth 
   increments (like SONET/SDH, G.709 OTN, etc.) being controlled by a 
   GMPLS-based distributed control plane.  
    
   The following sub-sections are not intended to favor one technology 
   versus another. They just list pro and cons for each of them in 
   order to determine the mechanisms that GMPLS-based recovery must 
   deliver to overcome their cons and take benefits of their pros in 
   their respective applicability context.  
    
5.2.1 OTN Recovery 
    
   OTN recovery specifics are left for further considerations. 
    
5.2.2 Pre-OTN Recovery 
    
   Pre-OTN recovery specifics (also referred to as "lambda switching") 
   present mainly the following advantages: 
    
   - benefits from a simpler architecture making it more suitable for  
     mesh-based recovery types and schemes (on a per channel basis).  
    
   - when providing suppression of intermediate node transponders (vs.  
     use of non-standard masking of upstream failures) e.g. use of  
     squelching, implies that failures (such as LoL) will propagate to  
     edge nodes giving the possibility to initiate recovery actions  
     driven by upper layers.

draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-recovery-analysis-05.txt             April 2005 
 
 
    
   The main disadvantage comes from the lack of interworking due to the 
   large amount of failure management (in particular failure 
   notification protocols) and recovery mechanisms currently available.  
    
   Note also, that for all-optical networks, combination of recovery 
   with optical physical impairments is left for a future release of 
   this document since corresponding detection technologies are under 
   specification.  
 
5.2.3 SONET/SDH Recovery 
    
   Some of the advantages of SONET [T1.105]/SDH [G.707] and more 
   generically any TDM transport plane recovery are that they provide: 
    
   - Protection types operating at the data plane level are  
     standardized (see [G.841]) and can operate across protected    
     domains and interwork (see [G.842]). 
    
   - Failure detection, notification and path/section Automatic 
     Protection Switching (APS) mechanisms. 
      
   - Greater control over the granularity of the TDM LSPs/links that  
     can be recovered with respect to coarser optical channel (or whole  
     fiber content) recovery switching 
      
   Some of the limitations of the SONET/SDH recovery are: 
    
   - Limited topological scope: Inherently the use of ring topologies, 
     typically, dedicated Sub-Network Connection Protection (SNCP) or  
     shared protection rings, has reduced flexibility and resource  
     efficiency with respect to the (somewhat more complex) meshed  
     recovery. 
    
   - Inefficient use of spare capacity: SONET/SDH protection is largely 
     applied to ring topologies, where spare capacity often remains    
     idle, making the efficiency of bandwidth usage a real issue. 
 
   - Support of meshed recovery requires intensive network management  
     development and the functionality is limited by both the network  
     elements and the capabilities of the element management systems  
     (justifying thus the development of GMPLS-based distributed  
     recovery mechanisms.) 
 
5.3 Specific Aspects of Control Plane-based Recovery Mechanisms 
 
5.3.1 In-band vs Out-of-band Signalling 
    
   The nodes communicate through the use of IP terminating control 
   channels defining the control plane (transport) topology. In this 
   context, two classes of transport mechanisms can be considered here 
   i.e. in-fiber or out-of-fiber (through a dedicated physically 
   diverse control network referred to as the Data Communication 
  
D.Papadimitriou et al. - Expires October 2005                       12 

draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-recovery-analysis-05.txt             April 2005 
 
 
   Network or DCN). The potential impact of the usage of an in-fiber 
   (signalling) transport mechanism is briefly considered here.  
    
   In-fiber transport mechanism can be further subdivided into in-band 
   and out-of-band. As such, the distinction between in-fiber in-band 
   and in-fiber out-of-band signalling reduces to the consideration of 
   a logically versus physically embedded control plane topology with 
   respect to the transport plane topology. In the scope of this 
   document, it is assumed that at least one IP control channel between 
   each pair of adjacent nodes is continuously available to enable the 
   exchange of recovery-related information and messages. Thus, in 
   either case (i.e. in-band or out-of-band) at least one logical or 
   physical control channel between each pair of nodes is always 
   expected to be available.      
    
   Therefore, the key issue when using in-fiber signalling is whether 
   one can assume independence between the fault-tolerance capabilities 
   of control plane and the failures affecting the transport plane 
   (including the nodes). Note also that existing specifications like 
   the OTN provide a limited form of independence for in-fiber 
   signaling by dedicating a separate optical supervisory channel (OSC, 
   see [G.709] and [G.874]) to transport the overhead and other control 
   traffic. For OTNs, failure of the OSC does not result in failing the 
   optical channels. Similarly, loss of the control channel must not 
   result in failing the data channels (transport plane). 
 
5.3.2 Uni- versus Bi-directional Failures 
    
   The failure detection, correlation and notification mechanisms 
   (described in Section 4) can be triggered when either a 
   unidirectional or a bi-directional LSP/Span failure occurs (or a 
   combination of both). As illustrated in Figure 1 and 2, two 
   alternatives can be considered here: 
       
   1. Uni-directional failure detection: the failure is detected on the  
      receiver side i.e. it is only is detected by the downstream node  
      to the failure (or by the upstream node depending on the failure  
      propagation direction, respectively).  
    
   2. Bi-directional failure detection: the failure is detected on the  
      receiver side of both downstream node AND upstream node to the  
      failure. 
 
   Notice that after the failure detection time, if only control plane 
   based failure management is provided, the peering node is unaware of 
   the failure detection status of its neighbor.

          Up Notification                      Down Notification 
 
   After failure detection, the following failure management operations 
   can be subsequently considered:  
    
   - Each detecting entity sends a notification message to the  
     corresponding transmitting entity. For instance, in Fig. 1 (Fig.  
     2), node C sends a notification message to node B (while node B  
     sends a notification message to node C). To ensure reliable  
     failure notification, a dedicated acknowledgment message can be  
     returned back to the sender node.   
    
   - Next, within a certain (and pre-determined) time window, nodes  
     impacted by the failure occurrences may perform their correlation.  
     In case of unidirectional failure, node B only receives the  
     notification message from node C and thus the time for this  
     operation is negligible. In case of bi-directional failure, node B  
     (and node C) has to correlate the received notification message  
     from node C (node B, respectively) with the corresponding locally  
     detected information. 
    
   - After some (pre-determined) period of time, referred to as the  
     hold-off time, after which the local recovery actions (see Section  
     5.3.4) were not successful, the following occurs. In case of  
     unidirectional failure and depending on the directionality of the  
     LSP, node B should send an upstream notification message (see  
     [RFC3473]) to the ingress node A and node C may send a downstream  
     notification message (see [RFC3473]) to the egress node D.  
     However, in such a case only node A referred to as the "master"  
     (node D being then referred to as the "slave" per [TERM]), would  
     initiate an edge to edge recovery action. Note that the other LSP  
     end-node (i.e. node D in this case) may be optionally notified  
     using a downstream notification message (see [RFC3473]). 
    
     In case of bi-directional failure, node B should send an upstream

     notification message (see [RFC3473]) to the ingress node A and  
     node C may send a downstream notification message (see [RFC3473])  
     to the egress node D. However, due to the dependence on the LSP  
     directionality, only ingress node A would initiate an edge to edge  
     recovery action. Note that the other LSP end-node (i.e. node D in  
     this case) should also be notified of this event using a  
     downstream notification message (see [RFC3473]). For instance, if  
     an LSP directed from D to A is under failure condition, only the  
     notification message sent from node C to D would initiate a  
     recovery action and, in this case, per [TERM], the deciding and  
     recovering node D is referred to as the "master" while node A is  
     referred to as the "slave" (i.e. recovering only entity). 
 
     Note: The determination of the master and the slave may be based  
     either on configured information or dedicated protocol capability. 
           
   In the above scenarios, the path followed by the upstream and 
   downstream notification messages does not have to be the same as the 
   one followed by the failed LSP (see [RFC3473] for more details on 
   the notification message exchange). The important point, concerning 
   this mechanism, is that either the detecting/reporting entity (i.e. 
   the nodes B and C) is also the deciding/recovery entity or the 
   detecting/reporting entity is simply an intermediate node in the 
   subsequent recovery process. One refers to local recovery in the 
   former case and to edge-to-edge recovery in the latter one (see also 
   Section 5.3.4).  
    
5.3.3 Partial versus Full Span Recovery 
    
   When a given span carries more than one LSPs or LSP segments, an 
   additional aspect must be considered. In case of span failure, the 
   LSPs it carries can be either individually recovered or recovered as 
   a group (aka bulk LSP recovery) or independent sub-groups. The 
   selection of this mechanism would be triggered independently of the 
   failure notification granularity when correlation time windows are 
   used and simultaneous recovery of several LSPs can be performed 
   using a single request. Moreover, criteria by which such sub-groups 
   can be formed are outside of the scope of this document.   
    
   Additional complexity arises in the case of (sub-)group LSP 
   recovery. Between a given pair of nodes, the LSPs that a given (sub-
   )group contains may have been created from different source nodes 
   (i.e. initiator) and directed toward different destinations nodes. 
   Consequently the failure notification messages sub-sequent to a bi-
   directional span failure affecting several LSPs (or the whole group 
   of LSPs it carries) are not necessarily directed toward the same 
   initiator nodes. In particular these messages may be directed to 
   both the upstream and downstream nodes to the failure. Therefore, 
   such span failure may trigger recovery actions to be performed from 
   both sides (i.e. both from the upstream and the downstream node to 
   the failure). In order to facilitate the definition of the 
   corresponding recovery mechanisms (and their sequence), one assumes 
   here as well, that per [TERM] the deciding (and recovering) entity,

draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-recovery-analysis-05.txt             April 2005 
 
 
   referred to as the "master" is the only initiator of the recovery of 
   the whole LSP (sub-)group. 
    
5.3.4 Difference between LSP, LSP Segment and Span Recovery 
    
   The recovery definitions given in [TERM] are quite generic and apply 
   for link (or local span) and LSP recovery. The major difference 
   between LSP, LSP Segment and span recovery is related to the number 
   of intermediate nodes that the signalling messages have to travel. 
   Since nodes are not necessarily adjacent in case of LSP (or LSP 
   Segment) recovery, signalling message exchanges from the reporting 
   to the deciding/recovery entity may have to cross several 
   intermediate nodes. In particular, this applies for the notification 
   messages due to the number of hops separating the location of a 
   failure occurrence from its destination. This results in an 
   additional propagation and forwarding delay. Note that the former 
   delay may in certain circumstances be non-negligible; e.g. in case 
   of copper out-of-band network, approximately 1 ms per 200km. 
    
   Moreover, the recovery mechanisms applicable to end-to-end LSPs and 
   to the segments that may compose an end-to-end LSP (i.e. edge-to-
   edge recovery) can be exactly the same. However, one expects in the 
   latter case, that the destination of the failure notification 
   message will be the ingress/egress of each of these segments. 
   Therefore, using the mechanisms described in Section 5.3.2, failure 
   notification messages can be first exchanged between terminating 
   points of the LSP segment and after expiration of the hold-off time 
   be directed toward terminating points of the end-to-end LSP. 
    
   Note: Several studies provide quantitative analysis of the relative 
   performance of LSP/span recovery techniques. [WANG] for instance, 
   provides an analysis grid for these techniques showing that dynamic 
   LSP restoration (see Section 5.5.2) performs well under medium 
   network loads but suffers performance degradations at higher loads 
   due to greater contention for recovery resources. LSP restoration 
   upon span failure, as defined in [WANG], degrades at higher loads 
   because paths around failed links tend to increase the hop count of 
   the affected LSPs and thus consume additional network resources. 
   Also, performance of LSP restoration can be enhanced by a failed 
   working LSP's source node initiating a new recovery attempt if an 
   initial attempt fails. A single retry attempt is sufficient to 
   produce large increases in the restoration success rate and ability 
   to initiate successful LSP restoration attempts, especially at high 
   loads, while not adding significantly to the long-term average 
   recovery time. Allowing additional attempts produces only small 
   additional gains in performance. This suggests using additional 
   (intermediate) crankback signalling when using dynamic LSP 
   restoration (described in Section 5.5.2 - case 2). Details on 
   crankback signalling are outside the scope of the present document. 
    
5.4 Difference between Recovery Type and Scheme

   [TERM] defines the basic LSP/span recovery types. This section 
   describes the recovery schemes that can be built using these 
   recovery types. In brief, a recovery scheme is defined as the 
   combination of several ingress-egress node pairs supporting a given 
   recovery type (from the set of the recovery types they allow). 
   Several examples are provided here to illustrate the difference 
   between recovery types such as 1:1 or M:N and recovery schemes such 
   as (1:1)^n or (M:N)^n referred to as shared-mesh recovery. 
    
   1. (1:1)^n with recovery resource sharing  
    
   The exponent, n, indicates the number of times a 1:1 recovery type 
   is applied between at most n different ingress-egress node pairs. 
   Here, at most n pairs of disjoint working and recovery LSPs/spans 
   share at most n times a common resource. Since the working LSPs/ 
   spans are mutually disjoint, simultaneous requests for use of the 
   shared (common) resource will only occur in case of simultaneous 
   failures, which is less likely to happen. 
    
   For instance, in the common (1:1)^2 case, if the 2 recovery LSPs in 
   the group overlap the same common resource, then it can handle only 
   single failures; any multiple working LSP failures will cause at 
   least one working LSP to be denied automatic recovery. Consider for 
   instance the following topology with the working LSPs A-B-C and F-G-
   H and their respective recovery LSPs A-D-E-C and F-D-E-H that share 
   a common D-E link resource. 
 
                          A---------B---------C 
                           \                 / 
                            \               /  
                             D-------------E 
                            /               \ 
                           /                 \

   2. (M:N)^n with recovery resource sharing 
    
   The (M:N)^n scheme is documented here for the sake of completeness 
   only (i.e. it is not mandated that GMPLS capabilities would support 
   this scheme). The exponent, n, indicates the number of times an M:N 
   recovery type is applied between at most n different ingress-egress 
   node pairs. So the interpretation follows from the previous case, 
   except that here disjointness applies to the N working LSPs/spans 
   and to the M recovery LSPs/spans while sharing at most n times M 
   common resources. 
    
   In both schemes, it results in a "group" of sum{n=1}^N N{n} working 
   LSPs and a pool of shared recovery resources, not all of which are 
   available to any given working LSP. In such conditions, defining a 
   metric that describes the amount of overlap among the recovery LSPs 
   would give some indication of the group's ability to handle 
   simultaneous failures of multiple LSPs.

   For instance, in the simple (1:1)^n case, if n recovery LSPs in a 
   (1:1)^n group overlap, then it can handle only single failures; any 
   simultaneous failure of multiple working LSPs will cause at least 
   one working LSP to be denied automatic recovery. But if one 
   considers for instance, a (2:2)^2 group in which there are two pairs 
   of overlapping recovery LSPs, then two LSPs (belonging to the same 
   pair) can be simultaneously recovered. The latter case can be 
   illustrated by the following topology with 2 pairs of working LSPs 
   A-B-C and F-G-H and their respective recovery LSPs A-D-E-C and F-D-
   E-H that share two common D-E link resources.  
    
    
                           A========B========C 
                           \\               // 
                            \\             // 
                             D =========== E 
                            //             \\ 
                           //               \\ 
                           F========G========H 
    
    
   Moreover, in all these schemes, (working) path disjointness can be 
   enforced by exchanging information related to working LSPs during 
   the recovery LSP signaling. Specific issues related to the 
   combination of shared (discrete) bandwidth and disjointness for 
   recovery schemes are described in Section 8.4.2. 
 
5.5 LSP Recovery Mechanisms 
 
5.5.1 Classification 
 
   The recovery time and ratio of LSPs/spans depend on proper recovery 
   LSP provisioning (meaning pre-provisioning when performed before 
   failure occurrence) and the level of overbooking of recovery 
   resources (i.e. over-provisioning). A proper balance of these two 
   operations will result in the desired LSP/span recovery time and 
   ratio when single or multiple failure(s) occur(s). Note also that 
   these operations are mostly performed during the network planning 
   phases. 
 
   The different options for LSP (pre-)provisioning and overbooking are 
   classified below to structure the analysis of the different recovery 
   mechanisms.  
    
   1. Pre-Provisioning 
    
   Proper recovery LSP pre-provisioning will help to alleviate the 
   failure of the working LSPs (due to the failure of the resources 
   that carry these LSPs). As an example, one may compute and establish 
   the recovery LSP either end-to-end or segment-per-segment, to 
   protect a working LSP from multiple failure events affecting

   link(s), node(s) and/or SRLG(s). The recovery LSP pre-provisioning 
   options can be classified (in the below figure) as follows: 
    
   (1) the recovery path can be either pre-computed or computed  
       on-demand.   
    
   (2) when the recovery path is pre-computed, it can be either pre- 
       signaled (implying recovery resource reservation) or signaled  
       on-demand.  
    
   (3) when the recovery resources are pre-signaled, they can be either  
       pre-selected or selected on-demand.  
    
   Recovery LSP provisioning phases: 
                                                                
                                                
   (1) Path Computation --> On-demand

           | 
            --> Pre-Computed

                    | 
                   (2) Signalling --> On-demand        
                           |    
                           | 
                            --> Pre-Signaled 
                                    | 
                                    | 
                                   (3) Resource Selection --> On-demand        
                                                | 
                                                | 
                                                 --> Pre-Selected 
 
   Note that these different options lead to different LSP/span 
   recovery times. The following sections will consider the above-
   mentioned pre-provisioning options when analyzing the different 
   recovery mechanisms. 
    
   2. Overbooking 
    
   There are many mechanisms available that allow the overbooking of 
   the recovery resources. This overbooking can be done per LSP (such 
   as the example mentioned above), per link (such as span protection) 
   or even per domain. In all these cases, the level of overbooking, as 
   shown in the below figure, can be classified as dedicated (such as 
   1+1 and 1:1), shared (such as 1:N and M:N) or unprotected (and thus 
   restorable if enough recovery resources are available).  
 
   Overbooking levels: 
    
                    +----- Dedicated (for instance: 1+1, 1:1, etc.)                   
                    |                                                            
                    |

                    +----- Shared (for instance: 1:N, M:N, etc.)                      
                    |

   Overbooking -----+----- Unprotected (for instance: 0:1, 0:N)                       
    
    
   Also, when using shared recovery, one may support preemptible extra-
   traffic; the recovery mechanism is then expected to allow preemption 
   of this low priority traffic in case of recovery resource contention 
   during recovery operations. The following sections will consider the 
   above-mentioned overbooking options when analyzing the different 
   recovery mechanisms. 
 
5.5.2 LSP Restoration 
    
   The following times are defined to provide a quantitative estimation 
   about the time performance of the different LSP restoration 
   mechanisms (also referred to as LSP re-routing): 
    
   - Path Computation Time: Tc 
   - Path Selection Time: Ts 
   - End-to-end LSP Resource Reservation Time: Tr (a delta for resource 
     selection is also considered, the corresponding total time is then  
     referred to as Trs) 
   - End-to-end LSP Resource Activation Time: Ta (a delta for  
     resource selection is also considered, the corresponding total  
     time is then referred to as Tas)  
    
   The Path Selection Time (Ts) is considered when a pool of recovery 
   LSP paths between a given pair of source/destination end-points is 
   pre-computed and after a failure occurrence one of these paths is 
   selected for the recovery of the LSP under failure condition. 
    
   Note: failure management operations such as failure detection, 
   correlation and notification are considered (for a given failure 
   event) as equally time consuming for all the mechanisms described 
   here below: 
 
   1. With Route Pre-computation (or LSP re-provisioning) 
    
   An end-to-end restoration LSP is established after the failure(s) 
   occur(s) based on a pre-computed path. As such, one can define this 
   as an "LSP re-provisioning" mechanism. Here, one or more (disjoint) 
   paths for the restoration LSP are computed (and optionally pre-
   selected) before a failure occurs. 
     
   No reservation or selection of resources is performed along the 
   restoration path before failure occurrence. As a result, there is no 
   guarantee that a restoration LSP is available when a failure occurs.  
    
   The expected total restoration time T is thus equal to Ts + Trs or 
   to Trs when a dedicated computation is performed for each working 
   LSP.

draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-recovery-analysis-05.txt             April 2005 
 
 
    
   2. Without Route Pre-computation (or Full LSP re-routing) 
    
   An end-to-end restoration LSP is dynamically established after the 
   failure(s) occur(s). Here, after failure occurrence, one or more 
   (disjoint) paths for the restoration LSP are dynamically computed 
   and one is selected. As such, one can define this as a complete "LSP 
   re-routing" mechanism.  
     
   No reservation or selection of resources is performed along the 
   restoration path before failure occurrence. As a result, there is no 
   guarantee that a restoration LSP is available when a failure occurs.  
    
   The expected total restoration time T is thus equal to Tc (+ Ts) + 
   Trs. Therefore, time performance between these two approaches 
   differs by the time required for route computation Tc (and its 
   potential selection time, Ts). 
 
5.5.3 Pre-planned LSP Restoration  
    
   Pre-planned LSP restoration (also referred to as pre-planned LSP re-
   routing) implies that the restoration LSP is pre-signaled. This in 
   turn implies the reservation of recovery resources along the 
   restoration path. Two cases can be defined based on whether the 
   recovery resources are pre-selected or not.  
 
   1. With resource reservation and without resource pre-selection 
    
   Before failure occurrence, an end-to-end restoration path is pre-
   selected from a set of pre-computed (disjoint) paths. The 
   restoration LSP is signaled along this pre-selected path to reserve 
   resources at each node but these resources are not selected.  
    
   In this case, the resources reserved for each restoration LSP may be 
   dedicated or shared between multiple restoration LSPs whose working 
   LSPs are not expected to fail simultaneously. Local node policies 
   can be applied to define the degree to which these resources can be 
   shared across independent failures. Also, since a restoration scheme 
   is considered, resource sharing should not be limited to restoration 
   LSPs starting and ending at the same ingress and egress nodes. 
   Therefore, each node participating to this scheme is expected to 
   receive some feedback information on the sharing degree of the 
   recovery resource(s) that this scheme involves. 
 
   Upon failure detection/notification message reception, signaling is 
   initiated along the restoration path to select the resources, and to 
   perform the appropriate operation at each node crossed by the 
   restoration LSP (e.g. cross-connections). If lower priority LSPs 
   were established using the restoration resources, they must be 
   preempted when the restoration LSP is activated.

draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-recovery-analysis-05.txt             April 2005 
 
 
   The expected total restoration time T is thus equal to Tas (post-
   failure activation) while operations performed before failure 
   occurrence takes Tc + Ts + Tr.  
    
   2. With both resource reservation and resource pre-selection 
    
   Before failure occurrence, an end-to-end restoration path is pre-
   selected from a set of pre-computed (disjoint) paths. The 
   restoration LSP is signaled along this pre-selected path to reserve 
   AND select resources at each node but these resources are not 
   committed at the data plane level. Such that the selection of the 
   recovery resources is committed at the control plane level only, no 
   cross-connections are performed along the restoration path. 
    
   In this case, the resources reserved and selected for each 
   restoration LSP may be dedicated or even shared between multiple 
   restoration LSPs whose associated working LSPs are not expected to 
   fail simultaneously. Local node policies can be applied to define 
   the degree to which these resources can be shared across independent 
   failures. Also, since a restoration scheme is considered, resource 
   sharing should not be limited to restoration LSPs starting and 
   ending at the same ingress and egress nodes. Therefore, each node 
   participating to this scheme is expected to receive some feedback 
   information on the sharing degree of the recovery resource(s) that 
   this scheme involves. 
    
   Upon failure detection/notification message reception, signaling is 
   initiated along the restoration path to activate the reserved and 
   selected resources, and to perform the appropriate operation at each 
   node crossed by the restoration LSP (e.g. cross-connections). If 
   lower priority LSPs were established using the restoration 
   resources, they must be preempted when the restoration LSP is 
   activated. 
 
   The expected total restoration time T is thus equal to Ta (post-
   failure activation) while operations performed before failure 
   occurrence takes Tc + Ts + Trs. Therefore, time performance between 
   these two approaches differs only by the time required for resource 
   selection during the activation of the recovery LSP (i.e. Tas - Ta). 
 
5.5.4 LSP Segment Restoration  
    
   The above approaches can be applied on an edge-to-edge LSP basis 
   rather than end-to-end LSP basis (i.e. to reduce the global recovery 
   time) by allowing the recovery of the individual LSP segments 
   constituting the end-to-end LSP.  
    
   Also, by using the horizontal hierarchy approach described in 
   Section 7.1, an end-to-end LSP can be recovered by multiple recovery 
   mechanisms applied on an LSP segment basis (e.g. 1:1 edge-to-edge 
   LSP protection in a metro network and M:N edge-to-edge protection in 
   the core). These mechanisms are ideally independent and may even use 
   different failure localization and notification mechanisms.

6. Reversion 
    
   Reversion (a.k.a. normalization) is defined as the mechanism 
   allowing switching of normal traffic from the recovery LSP/span to 
   the working LSP/span previously under failure condition. Use of 
   normalization is at the discretion of the recovery domain policy. 
   Normalization (also referred to as reversion) may impact the normal 
   traffic (a second hit) depending on the normalization mechanism 
   used. 
    
   If normalization is supported 1) the LSP/span must be returned to 
   the working LSP/span when the failure condition clears 2) the 
   capability to de-activate (turn-off) the use of reversion should be 
   provided. De-activation of reversion should not impact the normal 
   traffic regardless of whether currently using the working or 
   recovery LSP/span. 
    
   Note: during the failure, the reuse of any non-failed resources 
   (e.g. LSP and/or spans) belonging to the working LSP/span is under 
   the discretion of recovery domain policy. 
 
6.1 Wait-To-Restore (WTR) 
    
   A specific mechanism (Wait-To-Restore) is used to prevent frequent 
   recovery switching operations due to an intermittent defect (e.g. 
   BER fluctuating around the SD threshold).  
    
   First, an LSP/span under failure condition must become fault-free, 
   e.g. a BER less than a certain recovery threshold. After the 
   recovered LSP/span (i.e. the previously working LSP/span) meets this 
   criterion, a fixed period of time shall elapse before normal traffic 
   uses the corresponding resources again. This duration called Wait-
   To-Restore (WTR) period or timer is generally of the order of a few 
   minutes (for instance, 5 minutes) and should be capable of being 
   set. The WTR timer may be either a fixed period, or provide for 
   incrementally longer periods before retrying. An SF or SD condition 
   on the previously working LSP/span will override the WTR timer value 
   (i.e. the WTR cancels and the WTR timer will restart). 
    
6.2 Revertive Mode Operation 
    
   In revertive mode of operation, when the recovery LSP/span is no 
   longer required, i.e. the failed working LSP/span is no longer in SD 
   or SF condition, a local Wait-to-Restore (WTR) state will be 
   activated before switching the normal traffic back to the recovered 
   working LSP/span. 
    
   During the reversion operation, since this state becomes the highest 
   in priority, signalling must maintain the normal traffic on the 
   recovery LSP/span from the previously failed working LSP/span.  
   Moreover, during this WTR state, any null traffic or extra traffic 
   (if applicable) request is rejected.  
  
D.Papadimitriou et al. - Expires October 2005                       23 

draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-recovery-analysis-05.txt             April 2005 
 
 
    
   However, deactivation (cancellation) of the wait-to-restore timer 
   may occur in case of higher priority request attempts. That is the 
   recovery LSP/span usage by the normal traffic may be preempted if a 
   higher priority request for this recovery LSP/span is attempted. 
 
6.3 Orphans 
    
   When a reversion operation is requested normal traffic must be 
   switched from the recovery to the recovered working LSP/span. A 
   particular situation occurs when the previously working LSP/span 
   cannot be recovered such that normal traffic can not be switched 
   back. In such a case, the LSP/span under failure condition (also 
   referred to as "orphan") must be cleared i.e. removed from the pool 
   of resources allocated for normal traffic. Otherwise, potential de-
   synchronization between the control and transport plane resource 
   usage can appear. Depending on the signalling protocol capabilities 
   and behavior different mechanisms are expected here.  
    
   Therefore any reserved or allocated resources for the LSP/span under 
   failure condition must be unreserved/de-allocated. Several ways can 
   be used for that purpose: either wait for the elapsing of the clear-
   out time interval, or initiate a deletion from the ingress or the 
   egress node, or trigger the initiation of deletion from an entity 
   (such as an EMS or NMS) capable to react on the reception of an 
   appropriate notification message. 
 
7. Hierarchies 
    
   Recovery mechanisms are being made available at multiple (if not 
   each) transport layers within so-called "IP/MPLS-over-optical" 
   networks. However, each layer has certain recovery features and one 
   needs to determine the exact impact of the interaction between the 
   recovery mechanisms provided by these layers. 
    
   Hierarchies are used to build scalable complex systems. Abstraction 
   is used as a mechanism to build large networks or as a technique for 
   enforcing technology, topological or administrative boundaries by 
   hiding the internal details. The same hierarchical concept can be 
   applied to control the network survivability. Network survivability 
   is the set of capabilities that allow a network to restore affected 
   traffic in the event of a failure. Network survivability is defined 
   further in [TERM]. In general, it is expected that the recovery 
   action is taken by the recoverable LSP/span closest to the failure 
   in order to avoid the multiplication of recovery actions. Moreover, 
   recovery hierarchies can be also bound to control plane logical 
   partitions (e.g. administrative or topological boundaries). Each of 
   them may apply different recovery mechanisms.  
 
   In brief, the commonly accepted ideas are generally that the lower 
   layers can provide coarse but faster recovery while the higher 
   layers can provide finer but slower recovery. Moreover, it is also 
   desirable to avoid similar layers with functional overlaps to

draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-recovery-analysis-05.txt             April 2005 
 
 
   optimize network resource utilization and processing overhead, since 
   repeating the same capabilities at each layer does not create any 
   added value for the network as a whole. In addition, even if a lower 
   layer recovery mechanism is enabled, doing so does not prevent the 
   additional provision of a recovery mechanism at the upper layer. The 
   inverse statement does not necessarily hold; that is, enabling an 
   upper layer recovery mechanism may prevent the use of a lower layer 
   recovery mechanism. In this context, this section intends to analyze 
   these hierarchical aspects including the physical (passive) 
   layer(s). 
    
7.1 Horizontal Hierarchy (Partitioning)  
    
   A horizontal hierarchy is defined when partitioning a single-layer 
   network (and its control plane) into several recovery domains. 
   Within a domain, the recovery scope may extend over a link (or 
   span), LSP segment or even an end-to-end LSP. Moreover, an 
   administrative domain may consist of a single recovery domain or can 
   be partitioned into several smaller recovery domains. The operator 
   can partition the network into recovery domains based on physical 
   network topology, control plane capabilities or various traffic 
   engineering constraints. 
    
   An example often addressed in the literature is the metro-core-metro 
   application (sometimes extended to a metro-metro/core-core) within a 
   single transport layer (see Section 7.2). For such a case, an end-
   to-end LSP is defined between the ingress and egress metro nodes, 
   while LSP segments may be defined within the metro or core sub-
   networks. Each of these topological structures determines a so-
   called "recovery domain" since each of the LSPs they carry can have 
   its own recovery type (or even scheme). The support of multiple 
   recovery types and schemes within a sub-network is referred to as a 
   multi-recovery capable domain or simply multi-recovery domain.   
    
7.2 Vertical Hierarchy (Layers) 
    
   It is a very challenging task to combine in a coordinated manner the 
   different recovery capabilities available across the path (i.e. 
   switching capable) and section layers to ensure that certain network 
   survivability objectives are met for the different services 
   supported by the network. 
 
   As a first analysis step, one can draw the following guidelines for 
   a vertical coordination of the recovery mechanisms: 
   - The lower the layer the faster the notification and switching 
   - The higher the layer the finer the granularity of the recoverable  
     entity and therefore the granularity of the recovery resource  
    
   Moreover, in the context of this analysis, a vertical hierarchy 
   consists of multiple layered transport planes providing different: 
   - Discrete bandwidth granularities for non-packet LSPs such as OCh,  
     ODUk, STS_SPE/HOVC and VT_SPE/LOVC LSPs and continuous bandwidth  
     granularities for packet LSPs

   - Potential recovery capabilities with different temporal  
     granularities: ranging from milliseconds to tens of seconds 
    
   Note: based on the bandwidth granularity we can determine four 
   classes of vertical hierarchies (1) packet over packet (2) packet 
   over circuit (3) circuit over packet and (4) circuit over circuit. 
   Below we briefly expand on (4) only. (2) is covered in [RFC3386]. 
   (1) is extensively covered by the MPLS Working Group, and (3) by the 
   PWE3 Working Group. 
 
   In SONET/SDH environments, one typically considers the VT_SPE/LOVC 
   and STS SPE/HOVC as independent layers, VT_SPE/LOVC LSP using the 
   underlying STS_SPE/HOVC LSPs as links, for instance. In OTN, the 
   ODUk path layers will lie on the OCh path layer i.e. the ODUk LSPs 
   using the underlying OCh LSPs as OTUk links. Note here that lower 
   layer LSPs may simply be provisioned and not necessarily dynamically 
   triggered or established (control driven approach). In this context, 
   an LSP at the path layer (i.e. established using GMPLS signalling), 
   for instance an optical channel LSP, appears at the OTUk layer as a 
   link, controlled by a link management protocol such as LMP. 
 
   The first key issue with multi-layer recovery is that achieving 
   individual or bulk LSP recovery will be as efficient as the 
   underlying link (local span) recovery. In such a case, the span can 
   be either protected or unprotected, but the LSP it carries must be 
   (at least locally) recoverable. Therefore, the span recovery process 
   can be either independent when protected (or restorable), or 
   triggered by the upper LSP recovery process. The former case 
   requires coordination to achieve subsequent LSP recovery. Therefore, 
   in order to achieve robustness and fast convergence, multi-layer 
   recovery requires a fine-tuned coordination mechanism.  
    
   Moreover, in the absence of adequate recovery mechanism coordination 
   (for instance, a pre-determined coordination when using a hold-off 
   timer), a failure notification may propagate from one layer to the 
   next one within a recovery hierarchy. This can cause "collisions" 
   and trigger simultaneous recovery actions that may lead to race 
   conditions and in turn, reduce the optimization of the resource 
   utilization and/or generate global instabilities in the network (see 
   [MANCHESTER]). Therefore, a consistent and efficient escalation 
   strategy is needed to coordinate recovery across several layers.  
 
   Therefore, one can expect that the definition of the recovery 
   mechanisms and protocol(s) is technology-independent such that they 
   can be consistently implemented at different layers; this would in 
   turn simplify their global coordination. Moreover, as mentioned in 
   [RFC3386], some looser form of coordination and communication 
   between (vertical) layers such a consistent hold-off timer 
   configuration (and setup through signalling during the working LSP 
   establishment) can be considered, allowing the synchronization 
   between recovery actions performed across these layers.

7.2.1 Recovery Granularity 
 
   In most environments, the design of the network and the vertical 
   distribution of the LSP bandwidth are such that the recovery 
   granularity is finer at higher layers. The OTN and SONET/SDH layers 
   can only recover the whole section or the individual connections it 
   transports whereas the IP/MPLS control plane can recover individual 
   packet LSPs or groups of packet LSPs and this independently of their 
   granularity. On the other side, the recovery granularity at the sub-
   wavelength level (i.e. SONET/SDH) can be provided only when the 
   network includes devices switching at the same granularity (and thus 
   not with optical channel level). Therefore, the network layer can 
   deliver control-plane driven recovery mechanisms on a per-LSP basis 
   if and only if these LSPs have their corresponding switching 
   granularity supported at the transport plane level.  
    
7.3 Escalation Strategies 
    
   There are two types of escalation strategies (see [DEMEESTER]): 
   bottom-up and top-down.  
    
   The bottom-up approach assumes that lower layer recovery types and 
   schemes are more expedient and faster than the upper layer one. 
   Therefore we can inhibit or hold-off higher layer recovery. However 
   this assumption is not entirely true. Consider for instance a 
   Sonet/SDH based protection mechanism (with a less than 50 ms 
   protection switching time) lying on top of an OTN restoration 
   mechanism (with a less than 200 ms restoration time). Therefore, 
   this assumption should be (at least) clarified as: lower layer 
   recovery mechanism is expected to be faster than upper level one if 
   the same type of recovery mechanism is used at each layer. 
    
   Consequently, taking into account the recovery actions at the 
   different layers in a bottom-up approach, if lower layer recovery 
   mechanisms are provided and sequentially activated in conjunction 
   with higher layer ones, the lower layers must have an opportunity to 
   recover normal traffic before the higher layers do. However, if 
   lower layer recovery is slower than higher layer recovery, the lower 
   layer must either communicate the failure related information to the 
   higher layer(s) (and allow it to perform recovery), or use a hold-
   off timer in order to temporarily set the higher layer recovery 
   action in a "standby mode". Note that the a priori information 
   exchange between layers concerning their efficiency is not within 
   the current scope of this document. Nevertheless, the coordination 
   functionality between layers must be configurable and tunable.  
    
   An example of coordination between the optical and packet layer 
   control plane enables for instance the optical layer performing the 
   failure management operations (in particular, failure detection and 
   notification) while giving to the packet layer control plane the 
   authority to decide and perform the recovery actions. In case the 
   packet layer recovery action is unsuccessful, fallback at the 
   optical layer can be subsequently performed.

draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-recovery-analysis-05.txt             April 2005 
 
 
    
   The top-down approach attempts service recovery at the higher layers 
   before invoking lower layer recovery. Higher layer recovery is 
   service selective, and permits "per-CoS" or "per-connection" re-
   routing. With this approach, the most important aspect is that the 
   upper layer should provide its own reliable and independent failure 
   detection mechanism from the lower layer. 
    
   The same reference also suggests recovery mechanisms incorporating a 
   coordinated effort shared by two adjacent layers with periodic 
   status updates. Moreover, some of these recovery operations can be 
   pre-assigned (on a per-link basis) to a certain layer, e.g. a given 
   link will be recovered at the packet layer while another will be 
   recovered at the optical layer. 
 
7.4 Disjointness  
    
   Having link and node diverse working and recovery LSPs/spans does 
   not guarantee their complete disjointness. Due to the common 
   physical layer topology (passive), additional hierarchical concepts 
   such as the Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) and mechanisms such as 
   SRLG diverse path computation must be developed to provide complete 
   working and recovery LSP/span disjointness (see [IPO-IMP] and 
   [GMPLS-RTG]). Otherwise, a failure affecting the working LSP/span 
   would also potentially affect the recovery LSP/span; one refers to 
   such an event as "common failure". 
    
7.4.1 SRLG Disjointness 
    
   A Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) is defined as the set of links 
   sharing a common risk (for instance, a common physical resource such 
   as a fiber link or a fiber cable). For instance, a set of links L 
   belongs to the same SRLG s, if they are provisioned over the same 
   fiber link f. 
 
   The SRLG properties can be summarized as follows: 
    
   1) A link belongs to more than one SRLG if and only if it crosses  
      one of the resources covered by each of them. 
 
   2) Two links belonging to the same SRLG can belong individually to 
      (one or more) other SRLGs. 
    
   3) The SRLG set S of an LSP is defined as the union of the  
      individual SRLG s of the individual links composing this LSP. 
 
   SRLG disjointness is also applicable to LSPs: 
    
      The LSP SRLG disjointness concept is based on the following 
      postulate: an LSP (i.e. sequence of links and nodes) covers an  
      SRLG if and only if it crosses one of the links or nodes  
      belonging to that SRLG.

draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-recovery-analysis-05.txt             April 2005 
 
 
      Therefore, the SRLG disjointness for LSPs can be defined as  
      follows: two LSPs are disjoint with respect to an SRLG s if and  
      only if they do not cover simultaneously this SRLG s. 
    
      Whilst the SRLG disjointness for LSPs with respect to a set S of  
      SRLGs is defined as follows: two LSPs are disjoint with respect  
      to a set of SRLGs S if and only if the common SRLGs between the  
      sets of SRLGs they individually cover is disjoint from set S. 
    
   The impact on recovery is noticeable: SRLG disjointness is a 
   necessary (but not a sufficient) condition to ensure network 
   survivability. With respect to the physical network resources, a 
   working-recovery LSP/span pair must be SRLG disjoint in case of 
   dedicated recovery type. On the other hand, in case of shared 
   recovery, a group of working LSP/span must be mutually SRLG-disjoint 
   in order to allow for a (single and common) shared recovery LSP 
   itself SRLG-disjoint from each of the working LSPs/spans. 
 
8. Recovery Mechanisms Analysis 
    
   In order to provide a structured analysis of the recovery mechanisms 
   detailed in the previous sections, the following dimensions can be 
   considered: 
    
   1. Fast convergence (performance): provide a mechanism that  
      aggregates multiple failures (this implies fast failure  
      detection and correlation mechanisms) and fast recovery decision  
      independently of the number of failures occurring in the optical  
      network (implying also a fast failure notification). 
    
   2. Efficiency (scalability): minimize the switching time required  
      for LSP/span recovery independently of the number of LSPs/spans  
      being recovered (this implies an efficient failure correlation, a  
      fast failure notification and time-efficient recovery    
      mechanism(s)). 
     
   3. Robustness (availability): minimize the LSP/span downtime  
      independently of the underlying topology of the transport plane  
      (this implies a highly responsive recovery mechanism).  
    
   4. Resource optimization (optimality): minimize the resource  
      capacity, including LSPs/spans and nodes (switching capacity),  
      required for recovery purposes; this dimension can also be  
      referred to as optimizing the sharing degree of the recovery  
      resources. 
    
   5. Cost optimization: provide a cost-effective recovery type/scheme. 
    
   However, these dimensions are either outside the scope of this 
   document such as cost optimization and recovery path computational 
   aspects or mutually conflicting. For instance, it is obvious that 
   providing a 1+1 LSP protection minimizes the LSP downtime (in case

   of failure) while being non-scalable and consuming recovery resource 
   without enabling any extra-traffic. 
 
   The following sections provide an analysis of the recovery phases 
   and mechanisms detailed in the previous sections with respect to the 
   dimensions described here above to assess the GMPLS protocol suite 
   capabilities and applicability. In turn, this allows the evaluation 
   of the potential need for further GMPLS signaling and routing 
   extensions.  
    
8.1 Fast Convergence (Detection/Correlation and Hold-off Time) 
    
   Fast convergence is related to the failure management operations. It 
   refers to the elapsing time between the failure detection/ 
   correlation and hold-off time, point at which the recovery switching 
   actions are initiated. This point has been detailed in Section 4. 
 
8.2 Efficiency (Recovery Switching Time) 
    
   In general, the more pre-assignment/pre-planning of the recovery 
   LSP/span, the more rapid the recovery is. Since protection implies 
   pre-assignment (and cross-connection) of the protection resources, 
   in general, protection recover faster than restoration.  
    
   Span restoration is likely to be slower than most span protection 
   types; however this greatly depends on the efficiency of the span 
   restoration signalling. LSP restoration with pre-signaled and pre-
   selected recovery resources is likely to be faster than fully 
   dynamic LSP restoration, especially because of the elimination of 
   any potential crankback during the recovery LSP establishment.  
    
   If one excludes the crankback issue, the difference between dynamic 
   and pre-planned restoration depends on the restoration path 
   computation and selection time. Since computational considerations 
   are outside the scope of this document, it is up to the vendor to 
   determine the average and maximum path computation time in different 
   scenarios and to the operator to decide whether or not dynamic 
   restoration is advantageous over pre-planned schemes depending on 
   the network environment. This difference depends also on the 
   flexibility provided by pre-planned restoration versus dynamic 
   restoration: the former implies a somewhat limited number of failure 
   scenarios (that can be due, for instance, to local storage capacity 
   limitation). The latter enables on-demand path computation based on 
   the information received through failure notification message and as 
   such is more robust with respect to the failure scenario scope.  
 
   Moreover, LSP segment restoration, in particular, dynamic 
   restoration (i.e. no path pre-computation so none of the recovery 
   resource is pre-reserved) will generally be faster than end-to-end 
   LSP restoration. However, local LSP restoration assumes that each 
   LSP segment end-point has enough computational capacity to perform 
   this operation while end-to-end LSP restoration requires only that 
   LSP end-points provides this path computation capability.

   Recovery time objectives for SONET/SDH protection switching (not 
   including time to detect failure) are specified in [G.841] at 50 ms, 
   taking into account constraints on distance, number of connections 
   involved, and in the case of ring enhanced protection, number of 
   nodes in the ring. Recovery time objectives for restoration 
   mechanisms have been proposed through a separate effort [RFC3386]. 
 
8.3 Robustness 
    
   In general, the less pre-assignment (protection)/pre-planning 
   (restoration) of the recovery LSP/span, the more robust the recovery 
   type or scheme is to a variety of single failures, provided that 
   adequate resources are available. Moreover, the pre-selection of the 
   recovery resources gives in the case of multiple failure scenarios 
   less flexibility than no recovery resource pre-selection. For 
   instance, if failures occur that affect two LSPs sharing a common 
   link along their restoration paths, then only one of these LSPs can 
   be recovered. This occurs unless the restoration path of at least 
   one of these LSPs is re-computed or the local resource assignment is 
   modified on the fly. 
    
   In addition, recovery types and schemes with pre-planned recovery 
   resources, in particular LSP/spans for protection and LSPs for 
   restoration purposes, will not be able to recover from failures that 
   simultaneously affect both the working and recovery LSP/span. Thus, 
   the recovery resources should ideally be as disjoint as possible 
   (with respect to link, node and SRLG) from the working ones, so that 
   any single failure event will not affect both working and recovery 
   LSP/span. In brief, working and recovery resource must be fully 
   diverse in order to guarantee that a given failure will not affect 
   simultaneously the working and the recovery LSP/span. Also, the risk 
   of simultaneous failure of the working and the recovery LSP can be 
   reduced. This, by computing a new recovery path whenever a failure 
   occurs along one of the recovery LSPs or by computing a new recovery 
   path and provision the corresponding LSP whenever a failure occurs 
   along a working LSP/span. Both methods enable the network to 
   maintain the number of available recovery path constant. 
 
   The robustness of a recovery scheme is also determined by the amount 
   of pre-reserved (i.e. signaled) recovery resources within a given 
   shared resource pool: as the sharing degree of recovery resources 
   increases, the recovery scheme becomes less robust to multiple 
   LSP/span failure occurrences. Recovery schemes, in particular 
   restoration, with pre-signaled resource reservation (with or without 
   pre-selection) should be capable to reserve the adequate amount of 
   resource to ensure recovery from any specific set of failure events, 
   such as any single SRLG failure, any two SRLG failures etc.  
 
8.4 Resource Optimization 
    
   It is commonly admitted that sharing recovery resources provides 
   network resource optimization. Therefore, from a resource

draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-recovery-analysis-05.txt             April 2005 
 
 
   utilization perspective, protection schemes are often classified 
   with respect to their degree of sharing recovery resources with 
   respect to the working entities. Moreover, non-permanent bridging 
   protection types allow (under normal conditions) for extra-traffic 
   over the recovery resources.  
    
   From this perspective 1) 1+1 LSP/Span protection is the most 
   resource consuming protection type since not allowing for any extra-
   traffic 2) 1:1 LSP/span recovery requires dedicated recovery 
   LSP/span allowing for extra-traffic 3) 1:N and M:N LSP/span recovery 
   require 1 (M, respectively) recovery LSP/span (shared between the N 
   working LSP/span) allowing for extra-traffic. Obviously, 1+1 
   protection precludes and 1:1 recovery does not allow for any 
   recovery LSP/span sharing whereas 1:N and M:N recovery do allow 
   sharing of 1 (M, respectively) recovery LSP/spans between N working 
   LSP/spans. However, despite the fact that 1:1 LSP recovery precludes 
   the sharing of the recovery LSP, the recovery schemes (see Section 
   5.4) that can be built from it (e.g. (1:1)^n) do allow sharing of 
   its recovery resources. In addition, the flexibility in the usage of 
   shared recovery resources (in particular, shared links) may be 
   limited because of network topology restrictions, e.g. fixed ring 
   topology for traditional enhanced protection schemes.  
 
   On the other hand, when using LSP restoration with pre-signaled 
   resource reservation, the amount of reserved restoration capacity is 
   determined by the local bandwidth reservation policies. In LSP 
   restoration schemes with re-provisioning, a pool of spare resources 
   can be defined from which all resources are selected after failure 
   occurrence for the purpose of restoration path computation. The 
   degree to which restoration schemes allow sharing amongst multiple 
   independent failures is then directly inferred from the size of the 
   resource pool. Moreover, in all restoration schemes, spare resources 
   can be used to carry preemptible traffic (thus over preemptible 
   LSP/span) when the corresponding resources have not been committed 
   for LSP/span recovery purposes. 
     
   From this, it clearly follows that less recovery resources (i.e. 
   LSP/spans and switching capacity) have to be allocated to a shared 
   recovery resource pool if a greater sharing degree is allowed. Thus, 
   the network survivability level is determined by the policy that 
   defines the amount of shared recovery resources and by the maximum 
   sharing degree allowed for these recovery resources.  
    
8.4.1. Recovery Resource Sharing 
    
   When recovery resources are shared over several LSP/Spans, the use 
   of the Maximum Reservable Bandwidth, the Unreserved Bandwidth and 
   the Maximum LSP Bandwidth (see [GMPLS-RTG]) provides the information 
   needed to obtain the optimization of the network resources allocated 
   for shared recovery purposes. 
    
   The Maximum Reservable Bandwidth is defined as the Maximum Link 
   Bandwidth but it may be greater in case of link over-subscription. 
  
D.Papadimitriou et al. - Expires October 2005                       32 

draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-recovery-analysis-05.txt             April 2005 
 
 
   The Unreserved Bandwidth (at priority p) is defined as the bandwidth 
   not yet reserved on a given TE link (its initial value for each 
   priority p corresponds to the Maximum Reservable Bandwidth). Last, 
   the Maximum LSP Bandwidth (at priority p) is defined as the smaller 
   of Unreserved Bandwidth (at priority p) and Maximum Link Bandwidth. 
    
   Here, one generally considers a recovery resource sharing degree (or 
   ratio) to globally optimize the shared recovery resource usage. The 
   distribution of the bandwidth utilization per TE link can be 
   inferred from the per-priority bandwidth pre-allocation. By using 
   the Maximum LSP Bandwidth and the Maximum Reservable Bandwidth, the 
   amount of (over-provisioned) resources that can be used for shared 
   recovery purposes is known from the IGP.  
 
   In order to analyze this behavior, we define the difference between 
   the Maximum Reservable Bandwidth (in the present case, this value is 
   greater than the Maximum Link Bandwidth) and the Maximum LSP 
   Bandwidth per TE link i as the Maximum Shareable Bandwidth or 
   max_R[i]. Within this quantity, the amount of bandwidth currently 
   allocated for shared recovery per TE link i is defined as R[i]. Both 
   quantities are expressed in terms of discrete bandwidth units (and 
   thus, the Minimum LSP Bandwidth is of one bandwidth unit).  
    
   The knowledge of this information available per TE link can be 
   exploited in order to optimize the usage of the resources allocated 
   per TE link for shared recovery. If one refers to r[i] as the actual 
   bandwidth per TE link i (in terms of discrete bandwidth units) 
   committed for shared recovery, then the following quantity must be 
   maximized over the potential TE link candidates:  
    
        sum {i=1}^N [(R{i} - r{i})/(t{i} - b{i})]  
         
        or equivalently: sum {i=1}^N [(R{i} - r{i})/r{i}]  
         
        with R{i} >= 1 and r{i} >= 1 (in terms of per component    
        bandwidth unit)  
         
   In this formula, N is the total number of links traversed by a given 
   LSP, t[i] the Maximum Link Bandwidth per TE link i and b[i] the sum 
   per TE link i of the bandwidth committed for working LSPs and other 
   recovery LSPs (thus except "shared bandwidth" LSPs). The quantity 
   [(R{i} - r{i})/r{i}] is defined as the Shared (Recovery) Bandwidth 
   Ratio per TE link i. In addition, TE links for which R[i] reaches 
   max_R[i] or for which r[i] = 0 are pruned during shared recovery 
   path computation as well as TE links for which max_R[i] = r[i] which 
   can simply not be shared. 
    
   More generally, one can draw the following mapping between the 
   available bandwidth at the transport and control plane level: 
    
                                 - ---------- Max Reservable Bandwidth

   -------- 0                      ---------- 0 
 
 
   Note that the above approach does not require the flooding of any 
   per LSP information or any detailed distribution of the bandwidth 
   allocation per component link or individual ports or even any per-
   priority shareable recovery bandwidth information (using a dedicated 
   sub-TLV). The latter would provide the same capability than the 
   already defined Maximum LSP bandwidth per-priority information. Such 
   approach is referred to as a Partial (or Aggregated) Information 
   Routing as described for instance in [KODIALAM1] and [KODIALAM2]. 
   They show that the difference obtained with a Full (or Complete) 
   Information Routing approach (where for the whole set of working and 
   recovery LSPs, the amount of bandwidth units they use per-link is 
   known at each node and for each link) is clearly negligible. The 
   latter approach is detailed in [GLI], for instance. Note also that 
   both approaches rely on the deterministic knowledge (at different 
   degrees) of the network topology and resource usage status. 
 
   Moreover, extending the GMPLS signalling capabilities can enhance 
   the Partial Information Routing approach. This, by allowing working 
   LSP related information and in particular, its path (including link 
   and node identifiers) to be exchanged with the recovery LSP request 
   to enable more efficient admission control at upstream nodes of 
   shared recovery resources, in particular links (see Section 8.4.3).  
 
8.4.2 Recovery Resource Sharing and SRLG Recovery 
    
   Resource shareability can also be maximized with respect to the 
   number of times each SRLG is protected by a recovery resource (in 
   particular, a shared TE link) and methods can be considered for 
   avoiding contention of the shared recovery resources in case of 
   single SRLG failure. These methods enable for the sharing of 
   recovery resources between two (or more) recovery LSPs if their 
   respective working LSPs are mutually disjoint with respect to link, 
   node and SRLGs. A single failure then does not simultaneously 
   disrupt several (or at least two) working LSPs.  
    
   For instance, [BOUILLET] shows that the Partial Information Routing 
   approach can be extended to cover recovery resource shareability 
   with respect to SRLG recoverability (i.e. the number of times each 
   SRLG is recoverable). By flooding this aggregated information per TE

   link, path computation and selection of SRLG-diverse recovery LSPs 
   can be optimized with respect to the sharing of recovery resource 
   reserved on each TE link giving a performance difference of less 
   than 5% (and so negligible) compared to the corresponding Full 
   Information Flooding approach (see [GLI]).  
    
   For this purpose, additional extensions to [GMPLS-RTG] in support of 
   path computation for shared mesh recovery have been often considered 
   in the literature. TE link attributes would include, among other, 
   the current number of recovery LSPs sharing the recovery resources 
   reserved on the TE link and the current number of SRLGs recoverable 
   by this amount of (shared) recovery resources reserved on the TE 
   link. The latter is equivalent to the current number of SRLGs that 
   the recovery LSPs sharing the recovery resource reserved on the TE 
   link shall recover. Then, if explicit SRLG recoverability is 
   considered an additional TE link attribute including the explicit 
   list of SRLGs recoverable by the shared recovery resource reserved 
   on the TE link and their respective shareable recovery bandwidth. 
   The latter information is equivalent to the shareable recovery 
   bandwidth per SRLG (or per group of SRLGs) which implies to consider 
   a decreasing amount of shareable bandwidth and SRLG list over time. 
    
   Compared to the case of recovery resource sharing only (regardless 
   of SRLG recoverability, as described in Section 8.4.1), this 
   additional TE link attributes would potentially deliver better path 
   computation and selection (at distinct ingress node) for shared mesh 
   recovery purposes. However, due to the lack of results of evidence 
   for better efficiency and due to the complexity that such extensions 
   would generate, they are not further considered in the scope of the 
   present analysis. For instance, a per-SRLG group minimum/maximum 
   shareable recovery bandwidth is restricted by the length that the 
   corresponding (sub-)TLV may take and thus the number of SRLGs that 
   it can include. Therefore, the corresponding parameter should not be 
   translated into GMPLS routing (or even signalling) protocol 
   extensions in the form of TE link sub-TLV. 
 
8.4.3 Recovery Resource Sharing, SRLG Disjointness and Admission  
   Control 
    
   Admission control is a strict requirement to be fulfilled by nodes 
   giving access to shared links. This can be illustrated using the 
   following network topology: 
    
      A ------ C ====== D       
      |        |        | 
      |        |        | 
      |        B        | 
      |        |        | 
      |        |        | 
       ------- E ------ F 
    
   Node A creates a working LSP to D (A-C-D), B creates simultaneously 
   a working LSP to D (B-C-D) and a recovery LSP (B-E-F-D) to the same

draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-recovery-analysis-05.txt             April 2005 
 
 
   destination. Then, A decides to create a recovery LSP to D (A-E-F-
   D), but since the C-D span carries both working LSPs, node E should 
   either assign a dedicated resource for this recovery LSP or reject 
   this request if the C-D span has already reached its maximum 
   recovery bandwidth sharing ratio. Otherwise, in the latter case, C-D 
   span failure would imply that one of the working LSP would not be 
   recoverable. 
    
   Consequently, node E must have the required information to perform 
   admission control for the recovery LSP requests it processes 
   (implying for instance, that the path followed by the working LSP is 
   carried with the corresponding recovery LSP request). If node E can 
   guarantee that the working LSPs (A-C-D and B-C-D) are SRLG disjoint 
   over the C-D span, it may securely accept the incoming recovery LSP 
   request and assign to the recovery LSPs (A-E-F-D and B-E-F-D) the 
   same resources on the link E-F. This, if the link E-F has not yet 
   reached its maximum recovery bandwidth sharing ratio. In this 
   example, one assumes that the node failure probability is negligible 
   compared to the link failure probability. 
    
   To achieve this, the path followed by the working LSP is transported 
   with the recovery LSP request and examined at each upstream node of 
   potentially shareable links. Admission control is performed using 
   the interface identifiers (included in the path) to retrieve in the 
   TE DataBase the list of SRLG Ids associated to each of the working 
   LSP links. If the working LSPs (A-C-D and B-C-D) have one or more 
   link or SRLG id in common (in this example, one or more SRLG id in 
   common over the span C-D) node E should not assign the same resource 
   over link E-F to the recovery LSPs (A-E-F-D and B-E-F-D). Otherwise, 
   one of these working LSPs would not be recoverable in case of C-D 
   span failure.   
    
   There are some issues related to this method, the major one being 
   the number of SRLG Ids that a single link can cover (more than 100, 
   in complex environments). Moreover, when using link bundles, this 
   approach may generate the rejection of some recovery LSP requests. 
   This occurs when the SRLG sub-TLV corresponding to a link bundle 
   includes the union of the SRLG id list of all the component links 
   belonging to this bundle (see [GMPLS-RTG] and [BUNDLE]).   
    
   In order to overcome this specific issue, an additional mechanism 
   may consist of querying the nodes where such an information would be 
   available (in this case, node E would query C). The main drawback of 
   this method is that, in addition to the dedicated mechanism(s) it 
   requires, it may become complex when several common nodes are 
   traversed by the working LSPs. Therefore, when using link bundles, 
   solving this issue is tightly related to the sequence of the 
   recovery operations. Per component flooding of SRLG identifiers 
   would deeply impact the scalability of the link state routing 
   protocol. Therefore, one may rely on the usage of an on-line 
   accessible network management system.

   1a. Recovery LSP setup (before failure occurrence) with resource 
       reservation (i.e. signalling) and selection is referred to as  
       LSP protection. 
    
   2a. Recovery LSP setup (before failure occurrence) with resource 
       reservation (i.e. signalling) and with resource pre-selection is 
       referred to as pre-planned LSP re-routing with resource pre- 
       selection. This implies only recovery LSP activation after  
       failure occurrence. 
    
   3a. Recovery LSP setup (before failure occurrence) with resource 
       reservation (i.e. signalling) and without resource selection is 
       referred to as pre-planned LSP re-routing without resource pre- 
       selection. This implies recovery LSP activation and resource  
       (i.e. label) selection after failure occurrence. 
    
   3b. Recovery LSP setup after failure occurrence is referred to as 
       to as LSP re-routing, which is full when recovery LSP path  
       computation occurs after failure occurrence. 
    
   The term pre-planned refers thus to recovery LSP path pre-
   computation, signaling (reservation), and a priori resource 
   selection (optional), but not cross-connection. Also, the shared-

   mesh recovery scheme can be viewed as a particular case of 2a) and 
   3a) using the additional constraint described in Section 8.4.3.  
    
   The implementation of these recovery mechanisms requires only 
   considering extensions to GMPLS signalling protocols (i.e. [RFC3471] 
   and [RFC3473]). These GMPLS signalling extensions should mainly 
   focus in delivering (1) recovery LSP pre-provisioning for the cases 
   1a, 2a and 3a, (2) LSP failure notification, (3) recovery LSP 
   switching action(s), and (4) reversion mechanisms.  
    
   Moreover, the present analysis (see Section 8) shows that no GMPLS 
   routing extensions are expected to efficiently implement any of 
   these recovery types and schemes. 
 
10. Security Considerations 
 
   This document does not introduce any additional security issue or 
   imply any specific security consideration from [RFC3945] to the 
   current RSVP-TE GMPLS signaling, routing protocols (OSPF-TE, IS-IS-
   TE) or network management protocols. 
    
   However, the authorization of requests for resources by GMPLS-
   capable nodes should determining whether a given party, presumable 
   already authenticated, has a right to access the requested 
   resources. This determination is typically a matter of local policy 
   control, for example by setting limits on the total bandwidth made 
   available to some party in the presence of resource contention. Such 
   policies may become quite complex as the number of users, types of 
   resources and sophistication of authorization rules increases. This 
   is particularly the case for recovery schemes that assume pre-
   planned sharing of recovery resources, or contention for resources 
   in case of dynamic re-routing. 
    
   Therefore, control elements should match them against the local 
   authorization policy. These control elements must be capable of 
   making decisions based on the identity of the requester, as verified 
   cryptographically and/or topologically.  
    
11. IANA Considerations 
    
   This document defines no new code points and requires no action by 
   IANA.
