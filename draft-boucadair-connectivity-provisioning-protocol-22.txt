1.  Introduction

   This document defines the Connectivity Provisioning Negotiation
   Protocol (CPNP) that is meant to dynamically exchange and negotiate
   connectivity provisioning parameters and other service-specific
   parameters between a Customer and a Provider.  CPNP is a tool that
   introduces automation in the service negotiation and activation
   procedures, thus fostering the overall service provisioning process.
   CPNP can be seen as a component of the dynamic negotiation meta-
   domain described in Section 3.4 of [RFC7149].

   CPNP is a generic protocol that can be used for other negotiation
   purposes than connectivity provisioning.  For example, CPNP can be
   used to request extra storage resources, to extend the footprint of a
   CDN (Content Delivery Networks), to enable additional features from a
   cloud Provider, etc.  CPNP can be extended with new Information

   Elements (IEs).  Sample negotiation use cases are described in
   Section 5.  Section 4 introduces several order processing models and
   precises those that are targeted by CPNP.  The CPNP negotiation model
   is then detailed in Section 7.

   [RFC7297] describes a Connectivity Provisioning Profile (CPP)
   template to capture connectivity requirements to be met by a
   transport infrastructure for the delivery of various services such as
   Voice over IP (VoIP), IPTV, and Virtual Private Network (VPN)
   services [RFC4026].  The CPP document defines the set of IP transfer
   parameters that reflect the guarantees that can be provided by the
   underlying transport network together with reachability scope and
   capacity needs.  CPNP uses the CPP template to encode connectivity
   provisioning clauses that are subject to negotiation.  The agreed CPP
   will be then passed to other functional elements that are responsible
   for the actual service activation and provisioning.  For example,
   NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040] can be used to activate
   adequate network features that are required to deliver the agreed
   service.  How the outcome of CPNP negotiation is translated into
   service and network provisioning actions is out of scope of this
   document.

   As a reminder, several proposals have been made in the past by the
   (research) community (e.g., COPS-SLS [I-D.nguyen-rap-cops-sls],
   Service Negotiation Protocol (SrNP) [TEQUILA], Dynamic Service
   Negotiation Protocol (DSNP) [I-D.itsumo-dsnp], Resource Negotiation
   and Pricing Protocol (RNAP) [Xin], Service Negotiation and
   Acquisition Protocol (SNAP) [Karl]).  CPNP leverages the experience
   of the authors with SrNP by separating the negotiation primitives
   from the service under negotiation.  Moreover, careful examination of
   the other proposals revealed certain deficiencies that were easier to
   address through the creation of a new protocol rather than modifying
   existing protocols.  For example:

   o  COPS-SLS relies upon COPS-PR [RFC3084], which is an Historic RFC.

   o  DSNP is tightly designed with one specific service in mind (QoS)
      and does not make any distinction between a quotation phase and
      the actual service ordering phase.

   One of the primary motivations of this document is to provide a
   permanent reference to exemplify how service negotiation can be
   automated.

   Implementation details are out of scope.  An example of required
   modules and interfaces to implement this specification is sketched in
   Section 4 of [AGAVE].  This specification builds on that effort.

2.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   Customer:  Is a business role which denotes an entity that is
      involved in the definition and the possible negotiation of an
      order, including a Connectivity Provisioning Agreement, with a
      Provider.  A connectivity provisioning order is captured in a
      dedicated CPP template-based document, which may specify (among
      other information): the sites to be connected, border nodes,
      outsourced operations (e.g., routing, force via points).

      The right to invoke the subscribed service may be delegated by the
      Customer to third-party End Users, or brokering services.

      A Customer can be a Service Provider, an application owner, an
      enterprise, a user, etc.

   Network Provider (or Provider):  Owns and administers one or many
      transport domain(s) (typically Autonomous System (AS)) composed of
      (IP) switching and transmission resources (e.g., routing,
      switching, forwarding, etc.).  Network Providers are responsible
      for delivering and operating connectivity services (e.g., offering
      global or restricted reachability at specific rates).  Offered
      connectivity services may not necessarily be restricted to IP.

      The policies to be enforced by the connectivity service delivery
      components can be derived from the technology-specific clauses
      that might be included in agreements with the Customers.  If no
      such clauses are included in the agreement, the mapping between
      the connectivity requirements and the underlying technology-
      specific policies to be enforced is deployment-specific.

   Quotation Order:  Denotes a request made by the Customer to the
      Provider that includes a set of requirements.  The Customer may
      express its service-specific requirements by assigning (strictly
      or loosely defined) values to the information items included in
      the commonly understood template (e.g., CPP template) describing
      the offered service.  These requirements constitute the parameters
      to be mutually agreed upon.

   Offer:  Refers to a response made by the Provider to a Customer's
      quotation order that describes the ability of the Provider to
      satisfy the order at the time of its receipt.  Offers reflect the
      capability of the Provider in accommodating received Customer
      orders beyond monolithic 'yes/no' answers.

Internet-Draft                    CPNP                         June 2020


      An offer may fully or partially meet the requirements of the
      corresponding order.  In the latter case, it may include
      alternative suggestions which the Customer may take into account
      by issuing a new order.

   Agreement:  Refers to an order placed by the Customer and accepted by
      the Provider.  It signals the successful conclusion of a
      negotiation cycle.

3.  CPNP Functional Elements

   The following functional elements are defined:

   CPNP client (or client):   Denotes a software instance that sends
      CPNP requests and receives CPNP responses.  The current operations
      that can be performed by a CPNP client are listed below:

      1.  Create a quotation order (Section 9.2.1).

      2.  Cancel an ongoing quotation order under negotiation
          (Section 9.2.7).

      3.  Accept an offer made by a server (Section 9.2.4).

      4.  Withdraw an agreement (Section 9.2.8).

      5.  Update an agreement (Section 9.2.9).

   CPNP server (or server):  Denotes a software instance that receives
      CPNP requests and sends back CPNP responses accordingly.  The CPNP
      server is responsible for the following operations:

      1.  Process a quotation order (Section 9.2.2).

      2.  Make an offer (Section 9.2.3).

      3.  Cancel an ongoing quotation order (Section 11.2.3).

      4.  Process an order withdrawal (Section 11.2.3).

4.  Order Processing Models

   For preparing their service orders, Customers may need to be aware of
   the offered services.  Therefore, Providers should first proceed with
   the announcement (or the exposure) of the services they can provide.
   The service announcement process may take place at designated global
   or Provider-specific service markets, or through explicit




Boucadair, et al.       Expires December 27, 2020               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                    CPNP                         June 2020


   interactions with the Providers.  The details of this process are
   outside the scope of this document.

   With or without such service announcement/exposure mechanisms in
   place, the following order processing models can be distinguished:

   Frozen model:

      The Customer cannot actually negotiate the parameters of the
      service(s) offered by a Provider.  After consulting the Provider's
      service portfolio, the Customer selects the service offer he/she
      wants to subscribe and places an order to the Provider.  Order
      handling is quite simple on the Provider side because the service
      is not customized as per Customer's requirements, but rather pre-
      designed to address a Customer base that shares the same
      requirements (i.e., these customers share the same Customer
      Provisioning Profile).  This mode can be implemented using
      existing tools such as [RFC8309].

   Negotiation-based model:

      Unlike the frozen model, the Customer documents his/her
      requirements in a request for a quotation, which is then sent to
      one or several Providers.  Solicited Providers check whether they
      can address these requirements or not, and get back to the
      Customer accordingly, possibly with an offer that may not exactly
      match customer's requirements (e.g., a 100 Mbps connection cannot
      be provisioned given the amount of available resources, but an 80
      Mbps connection can be provided).  A negotiation between the
      Customer and the Provider(s) then follows until both parties reach
      an agreement (or do not).

   Both frozen and negotiation-based models require the existence of
   appropriate service templates like a CPP template and their
   instantiation for expressing specific offerings from Providers and
   service requirements from Customers, respectively.  CPNP can be used
   in either model for automating the required Customer-Provider
   interactions.  The frozen model can be seen as a special case of the
   negotiation-based model.  This document focuses on the negotiation-
   based model.  Not only 'yes/no' answers but also counter-proposals
   may be offered by the Provider in response to Customer orders.

   Order processing management on the Network Provider's side usually
   solicits features supported by the following functional blocks:

   o  Network Provisioning (including Order Activation, Network
      Planning, etc.)
   o  Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA)



Boucadair, et al.       Expires December 27, 2020               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                    CPNP                         June 2020


   o  Network and service management (performance measurement and
      assessment, fault detection, etc.)
   o  Sales-related functional blocks (e.g., billing, invoice
      validation)
   o  Network Impact Analysis

   CPNP does not assume any specific knowledge about these functional
   blocks, drawing an explicit line between protocol operation and the
   logic for handling connectivity provisioning requests.  An order
   processing logic is typically fed with the information manipulated by
   the aforementioned functional blocks.  For example, the resources
   that can be allocated to accommodate Customer's requirements may
   depend on network availability estimates as calculated by the
   planning functions and related policies, as well as the number of
   orders to be processed simultaneously over a given period of time.

   This document does not elaborate on how Customers are identified and
   subsequently managed by the Provider's Information System.

5.  Sample Use Cases

   A non-exhaustive list of CPNP use cases is provided below:

   1.   [RFC4176] introduces the Layer 3 VPN (L3VPN) Service Order
        Management functional block which is responsible for managing
        the requests initiated by the Customers and tracks the status of
        the completion of the related operations.  CPNP can be used
        between the Customer and the Provider to negotiate L3VPN service
        parameters.

        A CPNP server could therefore be part of the L3VPN Service Order
        Management functional block discussed in [RFC4176].  A L3VPN
        Service YANG data Model (L3SM) is defined in [RFC8299].  Once an
        agreement is reached, the service can be provisioned using,
        e.g., the L3VPN Network YANG Model specified in
        [I-D.ietf-opsawg-l3sm-l3nm].

        Likewise, A CPNP server could be part of the Layer 2 VPN (L2VPN)
        Service Order Management functional block.  A YANG data model
        for L2VPN service delivery is defined in [RFC8466].  Once an
        agreement is reached, the L2VPN service can be provisioned
        using, e.g., the L2VPN Network YANG Model specified in
        [I-D.barguil-opsawg-l2sm-l2nm].

   2.   CPNP can be used between two adjacent domains to deliver IP
        interconnection services (e.g., enable, update, disconnect).
        For example, two Autonomous Systems (ASes) can be connected via
        several interconnection points.  CPNP can be used between these

Internet-Draft                    CPNP                         June 2020


        ASes to upgrade existing links, request additional resources,
        provision a new interconnection point, etc.

        See, for example, the framework documented in [ETICS].

   3.   An integrated Provider can use CPNP to rationalize connectivity
        provisioning needs related to its service portfolio.  A CPNP
        server function is used by network operations teams.  A CPNP
        interface to trigger CPNP negotiation cycles is exposed to
        service management teams.

   4.   Service Providers can use CPNP to initiate connectivity
        provisioning requests towards a number of Network Providers so
        as to optimize the cost of delivering their services.  Although
        multiple CPNP ordering cycles can be initiated by a Service
        Provider towards multiple Network Providers, a subset of these
        orders may actually be put into effect.

        For example, a cloud Service Provider can use CPNP to request
        more resources from Network Providers.

   5.   CPNP can also be used in the context of network slicing
        ([I-D.geng-netslices-architecture]) to request network resources
        together with a set of requirements that need to be satisfied by
        the Provider.  Such requirements are not restricted to basic IP
        forwarding capabilities, but may also include a characterization
        of a set of service functions that may be invoked.  For the
        network slicing case, the instances of a CPP template could be
        derived from the network slice templates inputs as documented in
        [I-D.contreras-teas-slice-nbi].

   6.   CPNP can be used in Machine-to-Machine (M2M) environments to
        dynamically subscribe to M2M services (e.g., access to data
        retrieved by a set of sensors, extend sensor coverage, etc.).

        Also, Internet of Things (IoT, [RFC6574]) domains may rely on
        CPNP to enable dynamic access to data produced by involved
        objects, according to their specific policies, to various
        external stakeholders such as data analytics and business
        intelligence companies.  Direct CPNP-based interactions between
        IoT domains and interested parties enable open access to diverse
        sets of data across the Internet, e.g., from multiple types of
        sensors, user groups and/or geographical areas.

   7.   CPNP can be used in the context of I2NSF ([RFC8329]) to capture
        the customer-driven policies to be enforced by a set of Network
        Security Functions.

   8.   A Provider offering cloud services can expose a CPNP interface
        to allow Customers to dynamically negotiate typical data center
        resources, such as additional storage, processing and networking
        resources, enhanced security filters, etc.

        Cloud computing providers typically structure their computation
        service offerings by bundling CPU, RAM, and storage units as
        quotas, instances, or flavors that can be consumed in an
        ephemeral or temporal fashion during the lifetime of the
        required function.  A similar approach is followed by CPNP (see
        for example, Section 9.2.11).

   9.   In the inter-cloud context (also called cloud of clouds or cloud
        federation), CPNP can be used to reserve computing and
        networking resources hosted by various cloud infrastructures.

   10.  CDN Providers can use CPNP to extend their footprint by
        interconnecting their respective CDN infrastructures [RFC6770]
        (see Figure 1).

   11.  Mapping Service Providers (MSPs, [RFC7215]) can use CPNP to
        enrich their mapping database by interconnecting their mapping
        system (see Figure 2).  This interconnection allows to relax the
        constraints on PxTR (Proxy Ingress/Egress Tunnel Router) in
        favour of native LISP (Locator/ID Separation Protocol)
        forwarding [RFC6830].  Also, it prevents the fragmentation of
        the LISP mapping database.  A framework is described in
        [I-D.boucadair-lisp-idr-ms-discovery].

   12.  CPNP may also be used between SDN (Software-Defined Networking)
        controllers in contexts where Cooperating Layered Architecture
        for Software-Defined Networking (CLAS) is enabled [RFC8597].

6.  CPNP Deployment Models

   Several CPNP deployment models can be envisaged.  Two examples are
   listed below:

   o  The Customer deploys a CPNP client while one or several CPNP
      servers are deployed by the Provider.  A CPNP client can discover
      its CPNP servers using a variety of means (static, dynamic, etc.).
   o  The Customer does not enable any CPNP client.  The Provider
      maintains a Customer Order Management portal.  The Customer can
      initiate connectivity provisioning quotation orders via the
      portal; appropriate CPNP messages are then generated and sent to
      the relevant CPNP server.  In this model, both the CPNP client and
      CPNP server are under the responsibility of the same
      administrative entity (i.e., Network Provider).

   Once the negotiation of connectivity provisioning parameters is
   successfully concluded, that is, an order has been placed by the
   Customer, the actual network provisioning operations are initiated.
   The specification of related dynamic resource allocation and policy
   enforcement schemes, as well as how CPNP servers interact with the
   network provisioning functional blocks at Provider sides are out of
   the scope of this document.

   This document does not make any assumption about the CPNP deployment
   model either.

7.  CPNP Negotiation Model

   CPNP runs between a Customer and a Provider carrying service orders
   from the Customer and corresponding responses from the Provider to
   the end of reaching a service provisioning agreement.  As the
   services offered by the Provider are well-described, by means of the
   CPP template for connectivity matters, the negotiation process is
   essentially a value-settlement process, where an agreement is pursued
   on the values of the commonly understood information items (service
   parameters) included in the service description template
   (Section 9.1.9).

   The protocol is transparent to the content that it carries and to the
   negotiation logic invoked at Customer and Provider sides, and which
   manipulates the content (i.e., the information carried in CPNP
   messages to proceed with the negotiation).




Boucadair, et al.       Expires December 27, 2020              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                    CPNP                         June 2020


   The protocol aims at facilitating the execution of the negotiation
   logic by providing the required generic communication primitives.

   Since negotiations are initiated and primarily driven by the
   Customer's negotiation logic, it is reasonable to assume that the
   Customer is the only party that can call for an agreement.  An
   implicit approach is adopted for not overloading the protocol with
   additional messages.  In particular, the acceptance of an offer made
   by the Provider signals a call for agreement from the Customer.  Note
   that it is almost certain the Provider will accept this call since it
   refers to an offer that itself made.  Of course, at any point the
   Provider or the Customer may quit the negotiations, each on its own
   grounds.

   Based on the above, CPNP adopts a Quotation Order/Offer/Answer model,
   which proceeds through the following basic steps (Figure 3):

   1.  The CPNP client specifies its service requirements via a
       Provision Quotation Order (PQO).  The order may include strictly
       or loosely defined values in the clauses describing service
       provisioning characteristics.

   2.  The CPNP server declines the PQO, or makes an offer to address
       the requirements of the PQO, or suggests a counter-proposal that
       partially addresses the requirements of the PQO in case specific
       requirements cannot be accommodated.

   3.  The CPNP client either accepts or declines the offer.  Accepting
       the offer by the CPNP client implies a call for agreement; thus
       the agreement between both parties and the conclusion of the
       negotiation.

                 Figure 3: Simplified Service Negotiation

   Multiple instances of CPNP may run at Customer's or Provider's
   domains.  A CPNP client may be engaged in multiple, simultaneous
   negotiations with the same or different CPNP servers (parallel
   negotiations, see Section 8.10) and a CPNP server may need to
   negotiate with other Provider(s) as part of negotiations that are
   ongoing with a CPNP client (cascaded negotiations, see Section 8.8).

   CPNP relies on various timers to run its operations.  Two types of
   timers are defined: those that are specific to CPNP message
   transmission and those that are specific to the negotiation logic.
   The latter are used to guide the negotiation logic at both CPNP
   client and CPNP server sides, particularly in cases where the CPNP
   client is involved in parallel negotiations with several CPNP servers
   or in cases where the CPNP server is in turn involved in negotiations
   with other Providers for processing a given customer-originated
   quotation order.  CPNP allows a CPNP server to request an extra time
   to proceed with the negotiation.  This request may be accepted or
   rejected by the CPNP client.

   Providers may need to publish available services to the Customers
   (see Section 4).  CPNP may optionally support this functionality.
   Dedicated templates can be defined for the purpose of service
   announcement, which will be used by the CPNP clients to initiate
   their CPNP negotiation cycles.

   For the sake of simplicity, a single Offer/Answer stage is assumed
   within one CPNP negotiation cycle.  Nevertheless, as already stated,
   multiple CPNP negotiation cycles can be undertaken by a CPNP client
   (see Figure 4).

   The model is flexible enough to accommodate changing conditions
   during the lifetime of a service (e.g., introduction of an additional
   VPN site).

   Means used by a CPNP client to retrieve a list of active/agreed
   offers are not defined in this document.

   An order can be implicitly or explicitly activated.  Section 3.11 of
   [RFC7297] specifies a dedicated clause called Activation Means.  Such
   clause indicates the required action(s) to be undertaken to activate
   access to the (IP connectivity) service.  This document defines a
   dedicated CPNP message that can be used for explicit activation
   (Section 9.2.11)).

8.  Protocol Overview

8.1.  Client/Server Communication

   CPNP is a client/server protocol that can run over any transport
   protocol.  Yet, UDP is the default transport mode secured with
   Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) [RFC6347].  No permanent

Internet-Draft                    CPNP                         June 2020


   CPNP transport session needs to be maintained between the client and
   the server.

   The CPNP client can be configured with the CPNP server(s).
   Typically, an IP address together with a port number are configured
   to the CPNP client, based upon manual or dynamic configuration means
   (e.g., DHCP).  Alternatively, a Provider may advertise the port
   number (CPNP_PORT) it uses to bind the CPNP service using SRV
   [RFC2782].

   The CPNP client may be provided with a domain name of the CPNP server
   for PKIX-based authentication purposes.  CPNP servers should prefer
   the use of DNS-ID and SRV-ID over CN-ID identifier types in
   certificate requests (Section 2.3 of [RFC6125]).  URI-IDs should not
   be used for CPNP server identity verification.

   The client sends CPNP requests using CPNP_PORT as the destination
   port number.  The same port number used as the source port number of
   a CPNP request sent to a CPNP server is used by the server to reply
   to that request.

   CPNP is independent of the IP address family.

   CPNP retransmission is discussed in Section 11.4 for unreliable
   transports.

   Considerations related to mutual authentication are discussed in
   Section 13.

8.2.  Policy Configuration on the CPNP Server

   As an input to its decision-making process, the CPNP server may be
   connected to various external modules such as: Customer Profiles,
   Network Topology, Network Resource Management, Order Repositories,
   AAA, and Network Provisioning Manager (an example is shown in
   Figure 5).

   These external modules provide inputs to the CPNP server, so that it
   can:

   o  Check whether a customer is entitled to initiate a provisioning
      quotation request.

   o  Check whether a customer is entitled to cancel an ongoing order.

   o  Check whether administrative data (e.g., billing-related
      information) have been verified before the processing of the
      request starts.

Internet-Draft                    CPNP                         June 2020


   o  Check whether network capacity is available or additional capacity
      is required.

   o  Receive guidelines from network design and sales blocks (e.g.,
      pricing, network usage levels, thresholds associated with the
      number of CPP templates that can be processed over a given period
      of time as a function of the nature of the service to be
      delivered, etc.).

   o  Transfer completed orders to network provisioning blocks (referred
      to as "Network Provisioning Manager" in Figure 5).  For example,
      the outcome of CPNP may be passed to modules such as Application-
      Based Network Operations (ABNO) [RFC7491] or network controllers.
      These controllers will use protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] to
      interact with the appropriate network nodes and functions for the
      sake of proper service activation and delivery.

   The above list of CPNP server operations is not exhaustive.

   The following order handling modes can also be configured on the
   server:

   1.  Fully automated mode: This mode does not require any action from
       the administrator when receiving a request for a service.  The
       server can execute its decision-making process related to the
       orders received and generate corresponding offers.

   2.  Administrative validation checking: Some or all of the server's
       operations are subject to administrative validation procedures.
       This mode requires an action from the administrator for every
       request received.  To that aim, the CPNP methods which can be
       automatically handled by the server (or are subject to one or
       several validation administrative checks) can be configured on
       the server.

8.3.  CPNP Session Entries

   A CPNP session entry is denoted by a tuple defined as follows:

   o  Transport session (typically, IP address of the CPNP client,
      client's port number, IP address of the CPNP server, and CPNP
      server's port number).

   o  Incremented Sequence Number (Section 11.3)

   o  Customer Agreement Identifier: This is a unique identifier
      assigned to the order under negotiation by the CPNP client
      (Section 9.1.1).  This identifier is also used by the client to
      identify the agreement that will result from a successful
      negotiation.

   o  Provider Agreement Identifier: This is a unique identifier
      assigned to the order under negotiation by the CPNP server
      (Section 9.1.2).  This identifier is also used by the server to
      identify the agreement that will result from a successful
      negotiation.

   o  Transaction-ID (Section 8.4).

8.4.  CPNP Transaction

   A CPNP transaction occurs between a client and a server for
   completing, modifying, withdrawing a service agreement, and comprises
   all CPNP messages exchanged between the client and the server, from
   the first request sent by the client to the final response sent by
   the server.  A CPNP transaction is bound to a CPNP session
   (Section 8.3).

   Because multiple CPNP transactions can be maintained by the CPNP
   client, the client must assign an identifier to uniquely identify a
   given transaction.  This identifier is denoted as Transaction-ID.

   The Transaction-ID must be randomly assigned by the CPNP client,
   according to the best current practice for generating random numbers
   [RFC4086] that cannot be guessed easily.  Transaction-ID is used for
   validating CPNP responses received by the client.

   In the context of a transaction, the client needs to randomly select
   a sequence number and assign it to the first CPNP message to send.
   This number is then incremented for each request message that is
   subsequently sent within the ongoing CPNP transaction (see
   Section 11.3).

8.5.  CPNP Timers

   CPNP adopts a simple retransmission procedure which relies on a
   retransmission timer denoted as RETRANS_TIMER and a maximum retry
   threshold.  The use of RETRANS_TIMER and a maximum retry threshold
   are described in Section 11.

   The response timer (EXPECTED_RESPONSE_TIME) is set by the client to
   denote the time, in seconds, the client will wait for receiving a
   response from the server to a provisioning quotation order request
   (see Section 9.1.6).  If the timer expires, the respective quotation
   order is cancelled by the client and a CANCEL message is generated
   accordingly.

   The expected offer timer (EXPECTED_OFFER_TIME) is set by the server
   to indicate the time by when the CPNP server is expecting to make an
   offer to the CPNP client (see Section 9.1.7).  If no offer is
   received by then, the CPNP client will consider the order as
   rejected.

   An offer expiration timer (VALIDITY_OFFER_TIME) is set by the server
   to represent the time, in minutes, after which an offer made by the
   server becomes invalid (see Section 9.1.8).

8.6.  CPNP Operations

   CPNP operations are listed below.  They may be augmented, depending
   on the nature of some transactions or because of security
   considerations that may necessitate a distinct CPNP client/server
   authentication phase before negotiation begins.

   o  QUOTATION (Section 9.2.1):

      This operation is used by the client to initiate a provisioning
      quotation order.  Upon receipt of a QUOTATION request, the server
      may respond with a PROCESSING, OFFER or a FAIL message.  A
      QUOTATION-initiated transaction can be terminated by a FAIL
      message.

   o  PROCESSING (Section 9.2.2):

      This operation is used to inform the remote party that the message
      (the order quotation or the offer) sent was received and it is
      processed.  This message can also be issued by the server to
      request more time, in which case the client may reply with an ACK
      or FAIL message depending on whether extra time can or cannot be
      granted.

   o  OFFER (Section 9.2.3):

      This operation is used by the server to inform the client about an
      offer that can best accommodate the requirements indicated in the
      previously received QUOTATION message.

   o  ACCEPT (Section 9.2.4):

      This operation is used by the client to confirm the acceptance of
      an offer made by the server.  This message implies a call for
      agreement.  An agreement is reached when an ACK is subsequently
      received from the server, which is likely to happen if the message
      is sent before the offer validity time expires; the server is
      unlikely to reject an offer that it has already made.

   o  DECLINE (Section 9.2.5):

      This operation is used by the client to reject an offer made by
      the server.  The ongoing transaction may not be terminated
      immediately, e.g., the server/client may issue another offer/
      order.

   o  ACK (Section 9.2.6):

      This operation is used by the server to acknowledge the receipt of
      an ACCEPT or WITHDRAW message, or by the client to confirm the
      time extension requested (conveyed in a PROCESSING message) by the
      server for processing the last received quotation order.

   o  CANCEL (Section 9.2.7):

      This operation is used by the client to cancel (quit) the ongoing
      transaction.

   o  WITHDRAW (Section 9.2.8):

      This operation is used by the client to withdraw a completed order
      (i.e., an agreement).

   o  UPDATE (Section 9.2.9):

      This operation is used by the client to update an existing
      agreement.  For example, this method can be invoked to add a new
      VPN site.  This method will trigger a new negotiation cycle.

   o  FAIL (Section 9.2.10):

      This operation is used by the server to indicate that it cannot
      accommodate the requirements documented in the PQO conveyed in the
      QUOTATION message or to inform the client about an error
      encountered when processing the received message.  In either case,
      the message implies that the server is unable to make offers and
      as a consequence, it terminates the ongoing transaction.

      This message is also used by the client to reject a time extension
      request received from the server (in a PROCESSING message).  The
      message includes a status code for providing explanatory
      information.

   The above CPNP primitives are service-independent.  CPNP messages may
   transparently carry service-specific objects which are handled by the
   negotiation logic at either side.

   The document defines the service objects that are required for
   connectivity provisioning negotiation (see Section 8.7) purposes.
   Additional service-specific objects to be carried in CPNP messages
   can be defined in the future for accommodating alternative deployment
   schemes or other service provisioning needs.

8.7.  Connectivity Provisioning Documents

   CPNP makes use of several flavors of Connectivity Provisioning
   Documents (CPD).  These documents follow the same CPP template
   described in [RFC7297].

   Requested Connectivity Provisioning Document (Requested CPD):
      Refers to the CPD included by a CPNP client in a QUOTATION
      request.

   Offered Connectivity Provisioning Document (Offered CPD):   This
      document is included by a CPNP server in an OFFER message.  Its
      information reflects the proposal of the server to accommodate all
      or a subset of the clauses depicted in a Requested CPD.  A
      validity time is associated with the offer made.

   Agreed Connectivity Provisioning Document (Agreed CPD):   If the
      client accepts an offer made by the server, the Offered CPD is
      included in an ACCEPT message.  This CPD is also included in an
      ACK message.  Thus, a 3-way handshake procedure is followed for
      successfully completing the negotiation.

   Figure 6 shows a typical CPNP negotiation cycle and the use of the
   different types of Connectivity Provisioning Documents.

               Figure 6: Connectivity Provisioning Documents

   A provisioning document can include parameters with fixed values,
   loosely-defined values, or any combination thereof.  A provisioning
   document is said to be concrete if all clauses have fixed values.

   A typical evolution of a negotiation cycle would start with a
   quotation order with loosely-defined parameters, and then, as offers
   are made, it would conclude with concrete provisioning document for
   calling for the agreement.

8.8.  Child Provisioning Quotation Orders

   If the server detects that network resources from another Network
   Provider need to be allocated in order to accommodate the
   requirements described in a PQO (e.g., in the context of an inter-
   domain VPN service, additional PE router resources need to be
   allocated), the server may generate child PQOs to request the
   appropriate network provisioning operations (see Figure 7).  In such
   situation, the server behaves also as a CPNP client.  The server
   associates the parent order with its child PQOs.  How this is
   achieved is implementation-specific (e.g., this can be typically
   achieved by locally adding the reference of the child PQO to the
   parent order).

                     Figure 7: Example of Child Orders

   Note that recursion must not be activated by the server for an order
   if the client includes a negotiation option to restrict the
   negotiation scope to the resources of the server's domain
   (Section 9.1.10.3).

   If recursion is not explicitly disabled, the server may notify the
   client when appropriate (Section 9.2.2).  Such notification may also
   depend on the nature of the service but also regulatory
   considerations.

8.9.  Multi-Segment Service

   A composite service (e.g., connectivity) requested by a customer
   could imply multi-segment services (e.g., multi-segment connectivity
   spanning an end-to-end scope), in the sense that one single CPNP
   request is decomposed into N connectivity requests at the provider's
   side (thereby leading to child orders).  The Provider is in charge of
   handling the complexity of splitting the generic provisioning order
   in a multi-segment context.  Such complexity is local to the
   Provider.

8.10.  Negotiating with Multiple CPNP Servers

   A CPNP client may undertake multiple negotiations in parallel with
   several servers for various reasons, such as cost optimization and
   fail-safety.  These multiple negotiations may lead to one or many
   agreements.




Boucadair, et al.       Expires December 27, 2020              [Page 23]

Internet-Draft                    CPNP                         June 2020


   The salient point underlining the parallel negotiation scenarios is
   that, although the negotiation protocol is strictly between two
   parties, this may not be the case of the negotiation logic.  The CPNP
   client negotiation logic may need to collectively drive parallel
   negotiations, as the negotiation with one server may affect the
   negotiation with other servers; for example, it may need to use the
   responses from all servers as an input for determining the messages
   (and their content) to subsequently send within the course of each
   individual negotiation.  Timing is therefore an important aspect at
   the client's side.  The CPNP client needs to have the ability to
   synchronize the receipt of the responses from the servers.  CPNP
   takes into account this requirement by allowing clients to specify in
   the QUOTATION message the time by which the server needs to respond
   (see Section 9.1.6).

8.11.  State Management

   Both the client and the server maintain repositories to store ongoing
   orders.  How these repositories are maintained is deployment-
   specific.  It is out of scope of this document to elaborate on such
   considerations.  Timestamps are also logged to track state change.
   Tracking may be needed for various reasons, including regulatory or
   billing ones.

   In order to accommodate failures that may lead to the reboot of the
   client or the server, the use of permanent storage is recommended,
   thereby facilitating state recovery.

8.11.1.  On the Client Side

   This is the list of the typical states that can be associated with a
   given order on the client's side:

   o  Created: when the order has been created.  It is not handled by
      the client until the administrator allows to process it.

   o  AwaitingProcessing: when the administrator approved the processing
      of a created order and the order has not been handled yet.

   o  PQOSent: when the order has been sent to the server.

   o  ServerProcessing: when the server has confirmed the receipt of the
      order.

   o  OfferReceived: when an offer has been received from the server.

   o  OfferProcessing: when a received offer is currently processed by
      the client.

   o  AcceptSent: when the client confirmed the offer to the server.

   o  Completed: when the offer is acknowledged by the server.

   o  Cancelled: when the order has failed or cancelled.

   Sub-states may be defined (e.g., to track failed vs. cancelled
   orders) but those are not shown in Figure 8.

8.11.2.  On the Server Side

   The following lists the states which can be associated with a given
   order and a corresponding offer on the server's side:

   o  PQOReceived: when the order has been received from the client.

   o  AwaitingProcessing: when the order is being processed by the
      server.  An action from the server administrator may be needed.

   o  OfferProposed: when the request has been successfully handled and
      an offer has been sent to the client.

   o  ProcessingReceived: when the server received a PROCESSING for an
      offer sent to the client.

   o  AcceptReceived: when the server received a confirmation for the
      offer from the client.

   o  Completed: when the server acknowledged the offer (accepted by
      client) to the client.  Transitioning to this state assumes that
      the ACK was received by the client (this can be detected by the
      server if it receives retransmitted ACCEPT from the client).

   o  Cancelled: when the order cannot be accommodated or it has been
      cancelled by the client.  Associate resources must be released in
      the latter case, if previously reserved.

   o  ChildCreated: when a child order has been created in cases where
      resources from another Network Provider are needed.

   o  ChildPQOSent: when a child order has been sent to the remote
      server.

   o  ChildServerProcessing: when a child order is currently processed
      by the remote server.

   o  ChildOfferReceived: when an offer has been received to a child
      order from the remote server.

   o  ChildOfferProcessing: when a received offer to a child order is
      currently processed.

   o  ChildAcceptSent: when the child offer (offer received from the
      remote server in response to a child order) is confirmed to the
      remote server.

9.  CPNP Objects

   This section defines CPNP objects using the RBNF format defined at
   [RFC5511].

      Note 1: The formats of CPNP messages are provided using a generic
      format.  Implementors can adapt RBNF definitions to their
      "favorite" message format.  For example, JSON [RFC8259] or CBOR
      [RFC7049] can be used.

      Note 2: CPNP messages cannot be blindly mapped to RESTCONF
      messages with the target service being modelled as configuration
      data because such data is supposed to be manipulated by a RESTCONF
      client only.  In such model, the RESTCONF server cannot use a
      value other than the one set by the client (e.g., Section 9.2.3)
      or remove offers from its own initiative (e.g., Section 9.1.8).
      An alternate approach might be to map CPNP operations into
      RESTCONF actions (rpc).  Assessing the feasibility of such
      approach is out of scope.

9.1.  Attributes

9.1.1.  CUSTOMER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER

   CUSTOMER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER is an identifier which is assigned by a
   client to identify an agreement.  This identifier must be unique to
   the client.

   Rules for assigning this identifier (including structure and
   semantic) are specific to the client (Customer).  The value of
   CUSTOMER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER is included in all CPNP messages.

   The client (Customer) assigns an identifier to an order under
   negotiation before an agreement is reached.  This identifier will be
   used to unambiguously identify the resulting agreement at the client
   side (Customer).

   The server handles CUSTOMER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER as an opaque value.

9.1.2.  PROVIDER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER

   PROVIDER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER is an identifier which is assigned by a
   server to identify an order.  This identifier must be unique to the
   server.

   Rules for assigning this identifier (including structure and
   semantic) are specific to the server (Provider).
   PROVIDER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER is included in all CPNP messages,

   except QUOTATION messages (because the state is only present at the
   client side).

   The server (Provider) assigns an identifier to an order under
   negotiation before an agreement is reached.  This identifier will be
   used to unambiguously identify the resulting agreement at the server
   side (Provider).

   The client handles PROVIDER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER as an opaque value.

9.1.3.  TRANSACTION_ID

   This object conveys the Transaction-ID introduced in Section 8.4.

9.1.4.  SEQUENCE_NUMBER

   Sequence Number is a number that is monotonically incremented in
   every new CPNP message pertaining to a given CPNP transaction.  This
   number is used to avoid reply attacks.

   Refer to Section 11.3.

9.1.5.  NONCE

   NONCE is a random value assigned by the CPNP server.  It is
   recommended to assign unique NONCE values for each order.

   NONCE is then mandatory to be included in subsequent CPNP client
   operations on the associated order (including the resulting
   agreement) such as: withdraw the order or update the order.

   If the NONCE validation checks fail, the server rejects the request
   with a FAIL message including the appropriate failure reason code.

9.1.6.  EXPECTED_RESPONSE_TIME

   This attribute indicates the time by when the CPNP client is
   expecting to receive a response from the CPNP server to a given PQO.
   If no offer is received by then, the CPNP client will consider the
   quotation order as rejected.

   EXPECTED_RESPONSE_TIME follows the date format specified in
   [RFC3339].

Internet-Draft                    CPNP                         June 2020


9.1.7.  EXPECTED_OFFER_TIME

   This attribute indicates the time by when the CPNP server is
   expecting to make an offer to the CPNP client.  If no offer is
   received by then, the CPNP client will consider the order as
   rejected.

   The CPNP server may propose an expected offer time that does not
   match the expected response time indicated in the quotation order
   message.  The CPNP client can accept or reject the proposed expected
   time by when the CPNP server will make an offer.

   The CPNP server can always request extra time for its processing, but
   this may be accepted or rejected by the CPNP client.

   EXPECTED_OFFER_TIME follows the date format specified in [RFC3339].

9.1.8.  VALIDITY_OFFER_TIME

   This attribute indicates the time of validity of an offer made by the
   CPNP server.  If the offer is not accepted before this date expires,
   the CPNP server will consider the CPNP client has rejected the offer;
   the CPNP server will silently remove this order from its base.

   VALIDITY_OFFER_TIME follows date format specified in [RFC3339].

9.1.9.  SERVICE_DESCRIPTION

   This document defines a machinery to negotiate any aspect subject to
   negotiation.  Service clauses that are under negotiation are conveyed
   using this attribute.

   The structure of the connectivity provisioning clauses is provided in
   the following sub-section.

9.1.9.1.  CONNECTIVITY_PROVISIONING_DOCUMENT

   The RBNF format of the Connectivity Provisioning Document (CPD) is
   shown in Figure 10:

9.1.10.  CPNP Information Elements

   An Information Element (IE) is an optional object which can be
   included in a CPNP message.

9.1.10.1.  Customer Description

   The client may include administrative information such as:

   o  Name
   o  Contact Information

   The format of this Information Element is as follows:

   <Customer Description> ::= [<NAME>] [<Contact Information>]
   <Contact Information> ::=  [<EMAIL_ADDRESS>] [<POSTAL_ADDRESS>]
                              [<TELEPHONE_NUMBER> ...]

9.1.10.2.  Provider Description

   The server may include administrative information in an offer such
   as:

   o  Name
   o  AS Number ([RFC6793])
   o  Contact Information

   The format of this Information Element is as follows:

 <Provider Description> ::= [<NAME>][<Contact Information>][<AS_NUMBER>]

9.1.10.3.  Negotiation Options

   The client may include some negotiation options such as:

   o  Setup purpose: A client may request the setup of a service (e.g.,
      connectivity) only for testing purposes during a limited period.
      The order can be extended to become permanent if the client was
      satisfied during the test period.  This operation is achieved
      using the UPDATE method.
   o  Activation type: A client may request a permanent or scheduled
      activation type.  If no activation type clause is included during
      the negotiation, this means that the order will be immediately
      activated right after the negotiation ends.

   The format of this Information Element is as follows:

   <Negotiation Options> ::= [<PURPOSE>]

9.2.  Operation Messages

   This section defines the RBNF format of CPNP operation messages.  The
   following operation codes are used:

   1:   QUOTATION (Section 9.2.1)
   2:   PROCESSING (Section 9.2.2)
   3:   OFFER (Section 9.2.3)
   4:   ACCEPT (Section 9.2.4)
   5:   DECLINE (Section 9.2.5)
   6:   ACK (Section 9.2.6)
   7:   CANCEL (Section 9.2.7)
   8:   WITHDRAW (Section 9.2.8)
   9:   UPDATE (Section 9.2.9)
   10:  FAIL (Section 9.2.10)
   11:  ACTIVATE (Section 9.2.11)

   These codes are used to unambiguously identify a CPNP operation; the
   operation code is conveyed in the "METHOD_CODE" attribute mentioned
   in the following sub-sections.

   In the following, "VERSION" refers to the CPNP version number.  This
   attribute must be set to 1.

9.2.1.  QUOTATION

   The format of the QUOTATION message is shown below:

   <QUOTATION Message> ::=  <VERSION>
                          <METHOD_CODE>
                          <SEQUENCE_NUMBER>
                          <TRANSACTION_ID>
                          <CUSTOMER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER>
                          [<EXPECTED_RESPONSE_TIME>]
                          <REQUESTED_CONNECTIVITY_PROVISIONING_DOCUMENT>
                          [<INFORMATION_ELEMENT>...]

   A QUOTATION message must include an order identifier which is
   generated by the client (CUSTOMER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER).  Because
   several orders can be issued to several servers, the QUOTATION
   message must also include a Transaction-ID.

   The message may include an EXPECTED_RESPONSE_TIME which indicates by
   when the client is expecting to receive an offer from the server.
   QUOTATION message must also include a requested service description
   (that is, requested connectivity provisioning document for
   connectivity services).

   The message may include ACTIVATION_TYPE to request a permanent or
   scheduled activation type (e.g., using the ACTIVATE method defined in
   Section 9.2.11).  If no such clause is included, the default mode is
   to assume that the order will be active once the agreed activation
   means are successfully invoked (e.g., Section 3.11 of [RFC7297]).

   When the client sends the QUOTATION message to the server, the state
   of the order changes to "PQOSent" at the client side.

9.2.2.  PROCESSING

   The format of the PROCESSING message is shown below:

   <PROCESSING Message> ::= <VERSION>
                            <METHOD_CODE>
                            <SEQUENCE_NUMBER>
                            <TRANSACTION_ID>

                            <CUSTOMER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER>
                            <PROVIDER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER>
                            [<EXPECTED_OFFER_TIME>]
                            [<PROCESSING_SUBCODE>]

   Upon receipt of a QUOTATION message, the server proceeds with parsing
   rules (see Section 10).  If no error is encountered, the server
   generates a PROCESSING response to the client to indicate the PQO has
   been received and it is being processed.  The server must generate an
   order identifier which identifies the order in its local order
   repository.  The server must copy the content of
   CUSTOMER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER and TRANSACTION_ID fields as conveyed
   in the QUOTATION message.  The server may include an
   EXPECTED_OFFER_TIME by when it expects to make an offer to the
   client.

   Upon receipt of a PROCESSING message, the client verifies whether it
   has issued a PQO to that server and which contains the
   CUSTOMER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER and TRANSACTION_ID.  If no such PQO is
   found, the PROCESSING message must be silently ignored.  If a PQO is
   found, the client may check whether it accepts the
   EXPECTED_OFFER_TIME and then, it changes to state of the order to
   "ServerProcessing".

   If more time is required by the server to process the quotation
   order, it may send a PROCESSING message that includes a new
   EXPECTED_OFFER_TIME.  The client can answer with an ACK message if
   more time is granted (Figure 11) or with a FAIL message if the time
   extension request is rejected (Figure 12).

   The server may provide more details in the PROCESSING_SUBCODE
   attribute about the reason for requesting more time to process the
   request.  The following codes are defined:

      (1) Upgrade of local resources

      (2) Request external resources

                       [<INFORMATION_ELEMENT>...]

   The server answers with an OFFER message to a QUOTATION request
   received from the client.  The offer will be considered as rejected
   by the client if no confirmation (ACCEPT message sent by the client)
   is received by the server before the expiration of the validity time.

   The server may include ACTIVATION_TYPE to indicate whether the offer
   is about a permanent or scheduled activation type.  The message may
   include ACTIVATION_SCHEDULE to indicate when the order is to be
   activated.  If no such clause is included, the default mode is to
   assume that the order will be active once the agreed activation means
   are successfully invoked (e.g., Section 3.11 of [RFC7297] or
   Section 9.2.11).

9.2.4.  ACCEPT

   The format of the ACCEPT message is shown below:

   <ACCEPT Message> ::=  <VERSION>
                         <METHOD_CODE>
                         <SEQUENCE_NUMBER>
                         <TRANSACTION_ID>
                         <CUSTOMER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER>
                         <PROVIDER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER>
                         <NONCE>
                         <AGREED_CONNECTIVITY_PROVISIONING_DOCUMENT>
                         [<INFORMATION_ELEMENT>...]

   This message is used by a client to confirm the acceptance of an
   offer received from a server.  The fields of this message must be
   copied from the received OFFER message.  This message should not be
   sent after the validity time of the offer expires, as indicated by
   the server (Section 9.2.3).

9.2.5.  DECLINE

   The format of the DECLINE message is shown below:

   <DECLINE Message> ::=  <VERSION>
                        <METHOD_CODE>
                        <SEQUENCE_NUMBER>
                        <TRANSACTION_ID>
                        <CUSTOMER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER>
                        <PROVIDER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER>
                        <NONCE>
                        [<REASON>...]

   The client may issue a DECLINE message to reject an offer.
   CUSTOMER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER, PROVIDER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER,
   TRANSACTION_ID, and NONCE are used by the server as keys to find the
   corresponding order.  If an order matches, the server changes the
   state of this order to "Cancelled" and then returns an ACK with a
   copy of the requested CPD to the requesting client.

Internet-Draft                    CPNP                         June 2020


   A DECLINE message may include an information element to indicate the
   reason for declining an offer.  The following codes are defined:

      1 (Unacceptable gap between the request and the offer)

      2 (Conflict with another offer from another server)

      3 (Activation type mismatch)

   If no order is found, the server returns a FAIL message to the
   requesting client.  In order to prevent DDoS (Distributed Denial of
   Service) attacks, the server should restrict the number of FAIL
   messages sent to a requesting client.  It may also rate-limit FAIL
   messages.

   A flow example is shown in Figure 13.

9.2.6.  ACK

   The format of the ACK message is shown below:

   <ACK Message> ::=  <VERSION>
                    <METHOD_CODE>
                    <SEQUENCE_NUMBER>
                    <TRANSACTION_ID>
                    <CUSTOMER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER>
                    <PROVIDER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER>
                    [<EXPECTED_RESPONSE_TIME>]
                    [<CONNECTIVITY_PROVISIONING_DOCUMENT>]
                    [<INFORMATION_ELEMENT>...]

   This message is issued by the server to close a CPNP transaction or
   by a client to grant more negotiation time to the server.

   This message is sent by the server as a response to an ACCEPT,
   WITHDRAW, DECLINE, or CANCEL message.  In this case, the ACK message
   must include the copy of the service description document as stored
   by the server.  In particular, the following considerations are taken
   into account for connectivity provisioning services:

   o  A copy of the requested/offered CPD is included by the server if
      it successfully handled a CANCEL message.
   o  A copy of the updated CPD is included by the server if it
      successfully handled an UPDATE message.
   o  A copy of the offered CPD is included by the server if it
      successfully handled an ACCEPT message in the context of a
      QUOTATION transaction (refer to "Agreed CPD" in Section 8.7).
   o  An empty CPD is included by the server if it successfully handled
      a DECLINE or WITHDRAW message.

   A client may issue an ACK message as a response to a time extension
   request (conveyed in PROCESSING) received from the server.  In such
   case, the ACK message must include an EXPECTED_RESPONSE_TIME that is
   likely to be set to the time extension requested by the server.

9.2.7.  CANCEL

   The format of the CANCEL message is shown below:

   <CANCEL Message> ::= <VERSION>
                        <METHOD_CODE>
                        <SEQUENCE_NUMBER>
                        <TRANSACTION_ID>
                        <CUSTOMER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER>
                        [<CONNECTIVITY_PROVISIONING_DOCUMENT>]

   The client can issue a CANCEL message at any stage during the CPNP
   negotiation process before an agreement is reached.
   CUSTOMER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER and TRANSACTION_ID are used by the
   server as keys to find the corresponding order.  If a quotation order
   matches, the server changes the state of this quotation order to
   "Cancelled" and then returns an ACK with a copy of the requested CPD
   to the requesting client.

   If no quotation order is found, the server returns a FAIL message to
   the requesting client.

9.2.8.  WITHDRAW

   The format of the WITHDRAW message is shown below:

   <WITHDRAW Message> ::= <VERSION>

                          <SEQUENCE_NUMBER>
                          <TRANSACTION_ID>
                          <CUSTOMER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER>
                          <PROVIDER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER>
                          <NONCE>
                          [<AGREED_CONNECTIVITY_PROVISIONING_DOCUMENT>]
                          [<INFORMATION_ELEMENT>...]

   This message is used to withdraw an offer already accepted by the
   Customer.  Figure 14 shows a typical usage of this message.

              +------+                              +------+
              |Client|                              |Server|
              +------+                              +------+
                 |============WITHDRAW(CPD)===========>|
                 |<============PROCESSING==============|

                     Figure 14: WITHDRAW Flow Example

   The WITHDRAW message must include the same
   CUSTOMER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER, PROVIDER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER, and
   NONCE as those used when creating the order.

   Upon receipt of a WITHDRAW message, the server checks whether an
   order matching the request is found.  If an order is found, the state
   of the order is changed to "Cancelled" and an ACK message including
   an Empty CPD is returned to the requesting client.  If no order is
   found, the server returns a FAIL message to the requesting client.

9.2.9.  UPDATE

   The format of the UPDATE message is shown below:

   <UPDATE Message> ::= <VERSION>
                        <METHOD_CODE>
                        <SEQUENCE_NUMBER>

   This message is sent by the CPNP client to update an existing service
   agreement (e.g., connectivity provisioning agreement).  The UPDATE
   message must include the same CUSTOMER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER,
   PROVIDER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER, and NONCE as those used when creating
   the order.  The CPNP client includes a new service description (e.g.,
   updated CPD) which integrates the requested modifications.  A new
   Transaction_ID must be assigned by the client.

   Upon receipt of an UPDATE message, the server checks whether an
   order, having state "Completed", matches
   CUSTOMER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER, PROVIDER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER, and
   NONCE.

   o  If no order is found, the CPNP server generates a FAIL error with
      the appropriate error code (Section 9.2.10).
   o  If an order is found, the server checks whether it can honor the
      request:

      *  A FAIL message is sent to the client if the server cannot honor
         the request.  The client may initiate a new PQO negotiation
         cycle (that is, a new UPDATE).
      *  An OFFER message including the updated clauses (e.g., updated
         connectivity provisioning document) is sent to the client.  For
         example, the server maintains an order for provisioning a VPN
         service that connects sites A, B, and C.  If the client sends
         an UPDATE message to remove site C, only sites A and B will be
         included in the OFFER sent by the server to the requesting
         client.

         Note that the cycle that is triggered by an UPDATE message is
         also considered as a negotiation cycle.

   A flow chart that illustrates the use of UPDATE operation is shown in
   Figure 15.

9.2.10.  FAIL

   The format of the FAIL message is shown below:

   <FAIL Message> ::= <VERSION>
                      <METHOD_CODE>
                      <SEQUENCE_NUMBER>
                      <TRANSACTION_ID>
                      <CUSTOMER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER>
                      <PROVIDER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER>
                      <STATUS_CODE>

   This message is sent in the following cases:

   o  The server cannot honor an order received from the client (i.e.,
      received in a QUOTATION or UPDATE request).
   o  The server encounters an error when processing a CPNP request
      received from the client.
   o  The client cannot grant more time to the server.  This is a
      response to a time extension request carried in a PROCESSING
      message.

   The status code indicates the error code.  The following codes are
   supported:

   1 (Message Validation Error):
        The message cannot be validated (see Section 10).
   2 (Authentication Required):
        The request cannot be handled because authentication is
        required.
   3 (Authorization Failed):
        The request cannot be handled because authorization failed.
   4 (Administratively prohibited):
        The request cannot be handled because of administrative
        policies.
   5 (Out of Resources):
        The request cannot be honored because resources (e.g., capacity)
        are insufficient.
   6 (Network Presence Error):
        The request cannot be honored because there is no network
        presence.
   7 (More Time Rejected):
        The request to extend the time for negotiation is rejected by
        the client.
   8 (Unsupported Activation Type):
        The request cannot be handled because the requested activation
        type is not supported.

9.2.11.  ACTIVATE

   The format of the ACTIVATE message is shown below:

   <ACTIVATE Message> ::=  <VERSION>

                        <NONCE>
                        <ACTIVATION_SCHEDULE>
                        [<INFORMATION_ELEMENT>...]

   This message is sent by the CPNP client to request the activation of
   an existing service agreement.  The message must include the same
   CUSTOMER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER, PROVIDER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER, and
   NONCE as those used when creating the order.  The CPNP client may
   includes a schedule target for activating this order.  A new
   Transaction_ID must be assigned by the client.

   Upon receipt of an ACTIVATE message, the server checks whether an
   order, having state "Completed", matches
   CUSTOMER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER, PROVIDER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER, and
   NONCE.

   o  If no completed order is found, the CPNP server generates a FAIL
      error with the appropriate error code (Section 9.2.10).
   o  If an order is found, the server checks whether it can honor the
      request:

      *  A FAIL message is sent to the client if the server cannot honor
         the request (e.g., out of resources or explicit activation
         wasn't negotiated with this client).
      *  An ACK is sent to the client to confirm that the immediate
         activation (or de-activation) of the order or its successful
         scheduling if a non-null ACTIVATION_SCHEDULE was included in
         the request.  Note that setting ACTIVATION_SCHEDULE to 0 in an
         ACTIVATE request has a special meaning: it is used to request a
         de-activation of an agreed order.

   Figure 16 illustrates the use of ACTIVATE operation.

10.2.  On the Server Side

   Method     Validation Checks
   ---------- ----------------------------------------------------------
   QUOTATION  The source IP address passes existing access filters (if
              any).           The sequence number carried in the packet
              must not be lower than the           sequence number
              maintained by the server.
   PROCESSING The sequence number carried in the packet must be greater
              than           the sequence number maintained by the
              server.
   CANCEL     {Source IP address, source port number, destination IP
              address,           destination port number, Transaction-
              ID, Customer Order Identifier}           must match an
              order with state set to "PQOReceived" or
              "OfferProposed" or "ProcessingReceived" or "AcceptReceived
              ". The           sequence number carried in the packet
              must be greater than the           sequence number
              maintained by the server.
   ACCEPT     {Source IP address, source port number, destination IP
              address,           destination port number, Transaction-

              Identifier, Nonce, Offered Connectivity Provisioning
              Order} must match an order with state set to
              "OfferProposed" or           "ProcessingReceived". The
              sequence number carried in the packet must           be
              greater than the sequence number maintained by the server.
   FAIL       {Source IP address, source port number, destination IP
              address,           destination port number, Transaction-
              ID, Customer Order Identifier,           Provider Order
              Identifier} must match an order with state set to
              "AwaitingProcessing" and for which a request to grant more
              time to           process an offer was requested. The
              sequence number carried in the           packet must be
              greater than the sequence number maintained by the
              server.
   DECLINE    {Source IP address, source port number, destination IP
              address,           destination port number, Transaction-
              ID, Customer Order Identifier,           Provider Order
              Identifier, Nonce} must match an order with state set
              to "OfferProposed" or "ProcessingReceived". The sequence
              number           carried in the packet must be greater
              than the sequence number           maintained by the
              server.
   UPDATE     The source IP address passes existing access filters (if
              any) and           {Customer Order Identifier, Provider

   WITHDRAW   The source IP address passes existing access filters (if
              any) and           {Customer Order Identifier, Provider
              Order Identifier, Nonce} must           match an existing
              order with state "Completed".
   ACTIVATE   The source IP address passes existing access filters (if
              any) and           {Customer Order Identifier, Provider
              Order Identifier, Nonce} must           match an existing
              order with state "Completed" for which the
              activation procedure is tagged to be explicit.

11.  Theory of Operation

   Both CPNP client and server proceed with message validation checks as
   specified in Section 10.

11.1.  Client Behavior

11.1.1.  Order Negotiation Cycle

   To place a provisioning quotation order, the client first initiates a
   local quotation order object identified by a unique identifier
   assigned by the client (Client Order Identifier).  The state of the
   quotation order is set to "Created".  The client then generates a
   QUOTATION request which includes the assigned identifier, possibly an
   expected response time, a Transaction-ID, and a Requested Service
   (e.g., Requested Connectivity Provisioning Document).  The client may
   include additional Information Elements such as Negotiation Options
   or Activation Type.

   The client may be configured to not enforce negotiation checks on
   EXPECTED_OFFER_TIME; if so, no EXPECTED_RESPONSE_TIME attribute (or
   EXPECTED_RESPONSE_TIME set to infinite) should be included in the
   quotation order.

   Once the request is sent to the server, the state of the request is
   set to "PQOSent" and a timer, if a response time is included in the
   quotation order, is set to the expiration time as included in the
   QUOTATION request.  The client also maintains a copy of the CPNP
   session entry details used to generate the QUOTATION request.  The
   CPNP client must listen on the same port number that it used to send
   the QUOTATION request.

   If no answer is received from the server before the retransmission
   timer expires (i.e., RETRANS_TIMER, Section 8.5), the client
   retransmits the message until maximum retry is reached (e.g., 3
   times).  The same sequence number is used for retransmitted packets.





Boucadair, et al.       Expires December 27, 2020              [Page 48]

Internet-Draft                    CPNP                         June 2020


   If a FAIL message is received, the client may decide to issue another
   (corrected) request towards the same server, cancel the local order,
   or contact another server.  The behavior of the client depends on the
   error code returned by the server in the FAIL message.

   If a PROCESSING message matching the CPNP session entry (Section 8.3)
   is received, the client updates the CPNP session entry with the
   PROVIDER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER information.  If the client does not
   accept the expected offer time that may have been indicated in the
   PROCESSING message, the client may decide to cancel the quotation
   order.  If the client accepts the EXPECTED_OFFER_TIME, it changes the
   state of the order to "ServerProcessing" and sets a timer to the
   value of EXPECTED_OFFER_TIME.  If no offer is made before the timer
   expires, the client changes the state of the order to "Cancelled".

   As a response to a time extension request (conveyed in a PROCESSING
   message that included a new EXPECTED_OFFER_TIME), the client may
   grant this extension by issuing an ACK message or reject the time
   extension with a FAIL message having a status code set to "More Time
   Rejected".

   If an OFFER message matching the CPNP session entry is received, the
   client checks if a PROCESSING message having the same
   PROVIDER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER has been received from the server.  If
   a PROCESSING message was already received for the same order but the
   PROVIDER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER does not match the identifier included
   in the OFFER message, the client silently ignores the message.  If a
   PROCESSING message having the same PROVIDER_AGREEMENT_IDENTIFIER was
   already received and matches the CPNP transaction identifier, the
   client changes the state of the order to "OfferReceived" and sets a
   timer to the value of VALIDITY_OFFER_TIME indicated in the OFFER
   message.

   If an offer is received from the server (i.e., as documented in an
   OFFER message), the client may accept or reject the offer.  The
   client accepts the offer by generating an ACCEPT message which
   confirms that the client agrees to subscribe to the offer documented
   in the OFFER message; the state of the order is passed to
   "AcceptSent".  The transaction is terminated if an ACK message is
   received from the server.  If no ACK is received from the server, the
   client proceeds with the retransmission of the ACCEPT message until
   the maximum retry is reached (Section 11.4).

   The client may also decide to reject the offer by sending a DECLINE
   message.  The state of the order is set by the client to "Cancelled".
   If an offer is not acceptable by the client, the client may decide to
   contact a new server or submit another order to the same server.

   Guidelines to issue an updated order or terminate the negotiation are
   specific to the client.

   An order can be activated (or de-activated) using the ACTIVATE
   message or other agreed activation means (Section 3.11 of [RFC7297]).

11.1.2.  Order Withdrawal Cycle

   A client may withdraw a completed order.  This is achieved by issuing
   a WITHDRAW message.  This message must include Customer Order
   Identifier, Provider Identifier, and Nonce returned during the order
   negotiation cycle, as specified in Section 11.1.1.

   If no ACK is received from the server, the client proceeds with the
   retransmission of the message.  If no ACK is received after the
   maximum retry is exhausted, the client should log the information and
   must send an alarm to the administrator.  If there is no specific
   instruction from the administrator, the client should schedule
   another Withdrawal cycle.  The client must not retry this Withdrawal
   cycle more frequently than every 300 seconds and must not retry more
   frequently than every 60 seconds.

11.1.3.  Order Update Cycle

   A client may update a completed order.  This is achieved by issuing
   an UPDATE message.  This message must include Customer Order
   Identifier, Provider Order Identifier and Nonce returned during the
   order negotiation cycle specified in Section 11.1.1.  The client must
   include in the UPDATE message an updated CPD with the requested
   changes.

   Subsequent messages exchange is similar to what is documented in
   Section 11.1.1.

11.2.  Server Behavior

11.2.1.  Order Processing

   Upon receipt of a QUOTATION message from a client, the server sets a
   CPNP session, stores Transaction-ID and generates a Provider Order
   Identifier.  Once preliminary validation checks are completed (
   Section 10), the server may return a PROCESSING message to inform the
   client that the quotation order is received and it is under
   processing; the server may include an expected offer time to notify
   the client by when an offer will be proposed.  An order with state
   "AwaitingProcessing" is created by the server.  The server runs its
   decision-making process to decide which offer it can make to honor




Boucadair, et al.       Expires December 27, 2020              [Page 50]

Internet-Draft                    CPNP                         June 2020


   the received order.  The offer should be made before the expected
   offer time expires.

   If the server cannot make an offer, it sends backs a FAIL message
   with the appropriate error code.

   If the server requires more negotiation time, it must send a
   PROCESSING message with a new EXPECTED_OFFER_TIME.  The client may
   grant this extension by issuing an ACK message or reject the time
   extension with a FAIL message having a status code set to "More Time
   Rejected".  If the client doesn't grant more time, the server must
   answer before the initial expected offer time; otherwise the client
   will decline the quotation order.

   If the server can honor the request or it can make an offer that
   meets only some of the requirements, it creates an OFFER message.
   The server must indicate the Transaction-ID, Customer Order
   Identifier as indicated in the QUOTATION message, and the Provider
   Order Identifier generated for this order.  The server must also
   include Nonce and the offered service document (e.g., offered
   Connectivity Provisioning Document).  The server includes an offer
   validity time as well.  Once sent to the client, the server changes
   the state of the order to "OfferProposed" and a timer set to the
   validity time is initiated.

   If the server determines that additional network resources from
   another network provider are needed to accommodate a quotation order,
   it will create child PQO(s) and will behave as a CPNP client to
   negotiate child PQO(s) with possible partnering providers (see
   Figure 7).

   If no PROCESSING, ACCEPT, or DECLINE message is received before the
   expiry of the RETRANS_TIMER, the server re-sends the same offer to
   the client.  This procedure is repeated until maximum retry is
   reached.

   If an ACCEPT message is received before the offered validity time
   expires, the server proceeds with validation checks as specified in
   Section 10.  The state of the corresponding order is passed to
   "AcceptReceived".  The server sends back an ACK message to terminate
   the order processing cycle.

   If a CANCEL/DECLINE message is received, the server proceeds with the
   cancellation of the order.  The state of the order is then passed to
   "Cancelled".

11.2.2.  Order Withdrawal

   A client may withdraw a completed order by issuing a WITHDRAW
   message.  Upon receipt of a WITHDRAW message, the server proceeds
   with the validation checks, as specified in Section 10:

   o  If the checks fail, a FAIL message is sent back to the client with
      the appropriate error code (e.g., 1 (Message Validation Error), 2
      (Authentication Required), or 3 (Authorization Failed)).

   o  If the checks succeed, the server clears the clauses of the
      Connectivity Provisioning Document, changes the state of the order
      to "Cancelled", and sends back an ACK message with an Empty
      Connectivity Provisioning Document.

11.2.3.  Order Update

   A client may update an order by issuing an UPDATE message.  Upon
   receipt of an UPDATE message, the server proceeds with the validation
   checks as specified in Section 10:

   o  If the checks fail, a FAIL message is sent back to the client with
      the appropriate error code (e.g., 1 (Message Validation Error), 2
      (Authentication Required), 3 (Authorization Failed), or 6 (Network
      Presence Error)).
   o  The exchange of subsequent messages is similar to what is
      specified in Section 11.1.1.  The server should generate a new
      Nonce value to be included in the offer made to the client.

11.3.  Sequence Numbers

   In each transaction, sequence numbers are used to protect the
   transaction against replay attacks.  Each communicating partner of
   the transaction maintains two sequence numbers, one for incoming
   packets and one for outgoing packets.  When a partner receives a
   message, it will check whether the sequence number in the message is
   larger than the incoming sequence number maintained locally.  If not,
   the message will be discarded.  If the message is proved to be
   legitimate, the value of the incoming sequence number maintained
   locally will be replaced by the value of the sequence number in the
   message.  When a partner sends out a message, it will insert the
   value of the outgoing sequence number into the message and increase
   the outgoing sequence number maintained locally by 1.

Internet-Draft                    CPNP                         June 2020


11.4.  Message Re-Transmission

   If a transaction partner sends out a message and does not receive any
   expected reply before the retransmission timer expires (i.e.,
   RETRANS_TIMER), a transaction partner will try to re-transmit the
   message.  The procedure is reiterated until a maximum retry is
   reached (e.g., 3 times).  An exception is the last message (e.g.,
   ACK) sent from the server in a transaction.  After sending this
   message, the retransmission timer will be disabled since no
   additional feedback is expected.

   In addition, if the partner receives a retransmission of a last
   incoming packet it handled, the partner can re-send the same answer
   to the incoming packet with a limited frequency.  If no answer was
   generated at the moment, the partner needs to generate a PROCESSING
   message as the answer.

   To optimize message retransmission, a partner could also store the
   last incoming packet and the associated answer.  Note that the times
   of retransmission could be decided by the local policy and
   retransmission will not cause any change of sequence numbers.

12.  Some Operational Guidelines

12.1.  Logging on the CPNP Server

   The CPNP server should be configurable to log various events and
   associated information.  Such information may include:

   o  Client's IP address
   o  Any event change (e.g., new quotation order, offer sent, order
      confirm, order cancellation, order withdraw, etc.)
   o  Timestamp

   The exact logging details are deployment-specific.

12.2.  Business Guidelines and Objectives

   The CPNP server can operate in the following modes:

   1.  Fully automated mode:

       The CPNP server is provisioned with a set of business guidelines
       and objectives that will be used as an input to the decision-
       making process.  The CPNP server will service received orders
       that fall into these business guidelines; otherwise, requests
       will be escalated to an administrator that will formally
       validate/invalidate an order request.  The set of policies to be



Boucadair, et al.       Expires December 27, 2020              [Page 53]

Internet-Draft                    CPNP                         June 2020


       configured to the CPNP server are specific to each administrative
       entity managing a CPNP server.

   2.  Administrative-based mode:

       This mode assumes some or all CPNP server' operations are subject
       to a formal administrative validation.  CPNP events will trigger
       appropriate validation requests that will be forwarded to the
       contact person(s) or department which is responsible for
       validating the orders.  Administrative validation messages are
       relayed using another protocol (e.g., SMTP) or a dedicated tool.

   Business guidelines are local to each administrative entity.  How
   validation requests are presented to an administrator are out of
   scope of this document; each administrative entity may decide the
   appropriate mechanism to enable for that purpose.

13.  Security Considerations

   Means to defend the server against denial-of-service attacks must be
   enabled.  For example, access control lists can be enforced on the
   client, the server or the network in between, to allow a trusted
   client to communicate with a trusted server.

   The client and the server must be mutually authenticated.
   Authenticated encryption must be used for data confidentiality and
   message integrity.

   The protocol does not provide security mechanisms to protect the
   confidentiality and integrity of the packets transported between the
   client and the server.  An underlying security protocol such as
   (e.g., Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) [RFC6347], Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) [RFC8446]) must be used to protect the integrity
   and confidentiality of protocol messages.  In this case, if it is
   possible to provide an Automated Key Management and associate each
   transaction with a different key, inter-transaction replay attacks
   can naturally be addressed.  If the client and the server use a
   single key, an additional mechanism should be provided to protect
   inter-transaction replay attacks between them.  Clients must
   implement DTLS record replay detection (Section 3.3 of [RFC6347]) or
   an equivalent mechanism to protect against replay attacks.

   DTLS and TLS with a cipher suite offering confidentiality protection
   and the guidance given in [RFC7525] must be followed to avoid attacks
   on (D)TLS.

   The client must silently discard CPNP responses received from unknown
   CPNP servers.  The use of a randomly generated Transaction-ID makes



Boucadair, et al.       Expires December 27, 2020              [Page 54]

Internet-Draft                    CPNP                         June 2020


   it hard to forge a response from a server with a spoofed IP address
   belonging to a legitimate CPNP server.  Furthermore, CPNP demands
   that messages from the server must include the correct identifiers of
   the orders.  Two order identifiers are used: one generated by the
   client and a second one generated by the server.  Both the CPNP
   client and server maintain the local identifier they assigned and the
   one assigned by the peer for a given order.  Means to detect swapping
   of these identifiers (even when such swapping occurs by inadvertence
   at the client or the server) should be enabled by CPNP clients/
   servers.  For example, the CPNP server should not assign a provider
   agreement identifier that is equal to a customer agreement identifier
   used by the CPNP client.

   The Provider must enforce means to protect privacy-related
   information included the documents (see Section 8.7) exchanged in
   CPNP messages [RFC6462].  In particular, this information must not be
   revealed to external parties without the consent of Customers.
   Providers should enforce policies to make Customer fingerprinting
   difficult to achieve (e.g., in a recursion request).  For more
   discussion about privacy, refer to [RFC6462][RFC6973].

   The Nonce and the Transaction ID attributes provide sufficient
   randomness and can effectively tolerate attacks raised by off-path
   adversaries, who do not have the capability of eavesdropping and
   intercepting the packets transported between the client and the
   server.  Only authorized clients must be able to modify agreed CPNP
   orders.  The use of a randomly generated Nonce by the server makes it
   hard to modify an agreement on behalf of a malicious third-party.
