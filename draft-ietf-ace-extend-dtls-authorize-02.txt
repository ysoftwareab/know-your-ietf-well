1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-ace-dtls-authorize] only specifies the use of DTLS
   [RFC6347] but works equally well for TLS [RFC8446].  For many
   constrained implementations, CoAP over UDP [RFC7252] is the first
   choice, but when deploying ACE in networks controlled by other
   entities (such as the Internet), UDP might be blocked on the path
   between the client and the RS, and the client might have to fall back
   to CoAP over TCP [RFC8323] for NAT or firewall traversal.  This
   feature is supported by the OSCORE profile
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oscore-profile] but is lacking in the DTLS profile.

   This document updates [I-D.ietf-ace-dtls-authorize] by specifying
   that the profile applies to TLS as well as DTLS.  The same access
   rights are valid in case transport layer security is provided by
   either DTLS or TLS, and the same access token can be used.
   Therefore, the value coap_dtls in the ace_profile parameter of an AS-
   to-Client response or in the ace_profile claim of an access token
   indicates that either DTLS or TLS can be used for transport layer
   security.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Readers are expected to be familiar with the terms and concepts
   described in [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz] and
   [I-D.ietf-ace-dtls-authorize].

3.  Connection Establishment

   Following the procedures defined in [I-D.ietf-ace-dtls-authorize], a
   Client can retrieve an Access Token from an Authorization Server (AS)
   in order to establish a security association with a specific Resource
   Server.  The ace_profile parameter in the Client-to-AS request and
   AS-to-client response is used to determine the ACE profile that the
   Client uses towards the Resource Server (RS).

   In case the ace_profile parameter indicates the use of the DTLS
   profile for ACE as defined in [I-D.ietf-ace-dtls-authorize], the
   Client MAY try to connect to the Resource Server via TLS, or try TLS
   and DTLS in parallel to accelerate the session setup.

   As resource-constrained devices are not expected to support both
   transport layer security mechanisms, a Client that implements either
   TLS or DTLS but not both might fail in establishing a secure
   communication channel with the Resource Server altogether.  This
   error SHOULD be handled by the Client in the same way as unsupported
   ACE profiles.  If the Client is modified accordingly or it learns
   that the Resource Server has been, the Client may try to connect to
   the Resource Server using the transport layer security mechanism that
   was previously not mutually supported.

   Note that a communication setup with an a priori unknown Resource
   Server typically employs an initial unauthorized resource request as
   illustrated in Section 2 of [I-D.ietf-ace-dtls-authorize].  If this
   message exchange succeeds, the Client SHOULD first use the same
   underlying transport protocol for the establishment of the security
   association as well (i.e., DTLS for UDP, and TLS for TCP).

   As a consequence, the selection of the transport protocol used for
   the initial unauthorized resource request also depends on the
   transport layer security mechanism supported by the Client.  Clients
   that support either DTLS or TLS but not both SHOULD use the transport
   protocol underlying the supported transport layer security mechanism
   also for an initial unauthorized resource request.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The following updates have been done for the "ACE Profiles" registry
   for the profile with Profile ID 1 and Profile name coap_dtls:

   Note to RFC Editor: Please replace all occurrences of "[RFC-XXXX]"
   with the RFC number of this specification and delete this paragraph.

   Description: Profile for delegating client Authentication and
   Authorization for Constrained Environments by establishing a Datagram
   Transport Layer Security (DTLS) or Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   channel between resource-constrained nodes.

   Change Controller: IESG

   Reference: [RFC-XXXX]

5.  Security Considerations

   The security consideration and requirements in TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] and
   BCP 195 [RFC7525] [RFC8996] also apply to this document.
