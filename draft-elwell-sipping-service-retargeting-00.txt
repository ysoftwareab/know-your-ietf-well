Abstract  
    
   This contains motivation, requirements and a proposed solution for 
   indicating service retargeting information in SIP requests and 
   responses. Retargeting of a request can be considered to be service 
   retargeting when it goes beyond "normal" routing and might be of 
   interest to applications at the UAS or UAC.

1 Introduction 
    
   Central to SIP [SIP] is the concept of retargeting a request by a 
   proxy, whereby the Request-URI in the original request is replaced 
   before forwarding the request on the next hop. Retargeting can also 
   occur because of redirection by a redirect server using a SIP 3xx 
   response code and subsequent recursion by the UAC or a proxy. Except 
   where otherwise stated, the term retargeting is used in this document 
   to cover recursion as well as retargeting. A given request from a 
   User Agent Client (UAC) can be retargeted zero or more times before 
   reaching the User Agent Server (UAS). 
    
   Retargeting is a normal part of routing a request in SIP. For 
   example, an outbound proxy might convert the initial Request-URI from 
   a telephone URI (perhaps in the form of a dial string) to a SIP URI. 
   As another example, the final proxy typically replaces an Address of 
   Record with the URI of a registered contact. 
    
   However, sometimes a service running at a proxy or redirect server 
   (including a UA acting as a redirect server) can initiate retargeting 
   to a specific service URI. Retargeting of this nature can be called 
   service retargeting, because it is based on special services that 
   operate on incoming requests to a target. An example of service 
   retargeting can be found in [SRVCTRL]. [SRVCTRL] specifies a means 
   for communicating context information to an application, with the 
   expectation that the recipient endpoint or application understands 
   the implications of the context information. Typically the original 
   target user will have made arrangements for service retargeting. 
   Service retargeting can be based on simple or complex rules for 
   handling requests to the original target. 
    
   For example, a request could be retargeted to a destination that can 
   handle requests that encounter busy or no reply at the original 
   target. As another example, a user could arrange that requests 
   targeted at the user be retargeted to a deputy, perhaps because the 
   original user expects to be absent or does not wish to be disturbed. 
   The fact that a request has been service retargeted is often of 
   interest to the users involved, i.e., the retargeted-to user and the 
   calling user, or to an application. Therefore it would be very useful 
   to provide to the UAS and the UAC details of retargeting in the form 
   of the original target URI, the retargeted-to URI and the reason for 
   retargeting. 
    
   Service retargeting information is also useful when interworking with 
   PSTN/ISDN. Service retargeting in SIP is similar to diversion in 
   PSTN/ISDN, and therefore service retargeting information in SIP can 
   be mapped to/from diversion information in PSTN/ISDN. For example, 
   for a call that is service retargeted in the SIP network because the 
 
 
Elwell                   Expires - April 2006                 [Page 3] 
                Indicating Service Retargeting in SIP    October 2005 
 
 
   original target is busy, if the new target is in PSTN/ISDN the 
   PSTN/ISDN can be told that the call has been diverted on busy. 
    
   As a further example, service retargeting information can be of use 
   to a voice mail server. When a  request is service retargeted to a 
   voice mail server the voice mail server is likely to need to know the 
   identity of the original target in order to access the correct 
   mailbox and the reason for service retargeting in order to behave 
   appropriately, e.g., play an appropriate announcement. 
    
   In all these examples, information about normal SIP retargeting, as 
   opposed to service retargeting, is not generally of interest. 
    
   [HIST] specifies a means of providing the UAS and UAC with 
   information about the retargeting of a request. This information 
   includes the initial Request-URI and any retarget-to URIs. This 
   information is placed in the History-Info header, field, which, 
   except where prevented by privacy considerations, is built up as the 
   request progresses and, on reaching the UAS, is returned in certain 
   responses. Within the History-Info header field, each URI, except for 
   the final one, includes as a parameter a Reason Header [REASON] 
   indicating the SIP response code that led to retargeting from that 
   URI to the next URI. This is either the response code received as a 
   result of forwarding the request to that URI or the nearest 
   equivalent if retargeting occurs without having forwarded the 
   request. 
    
   [HIST], when deployed at relevant SIP entities and not subject to 
   privacy, is intended to provide a comprehensive trace of retargeting 
   for a SIP request, along with the SIP response codes that led to 
   retargeting. [HIST] is captured independently of any service 
   interactions that might have resulted in retargeting.  [HIST] 
   captures the information independently of how an endpoint might make 
   use of the information. Thus, it does not fully meet the needs of 
   reporting service retargeting for the following reasons: 
    
   - [HIST] reports all retargets, not just service retargets. This puts 
   the burden on the UAS or UAC to pick out which retargets are for 
   service reasons and which are for normal SIP routing reasons. 
    
   - [HIST] reports reasons in the form of SIP response codes, which do 
   not necessarily reflect service reasons for retargeting very well and 
   are not always meaningful to applications. 
    
   - The SIP response codes captured by [HIST] are dependent upon 
   whether retargeting is as a result of recursion or not. When 
   recursion is used, the SIP response code will always be in the 3xx 
   range, but otherwise, even if the reason for retargeting is 
   identical, the reason will not be in the 3xx range. For example, if

                Indicating Service Retargeting in SIP    October 2005 
 
 
   retargeting is due to the previous target being busy, the SIP 
   response code used without recursion would normally be 486, but with 
   recursion it would have to be a 3xx response code (e.g., 302). 
    
    
   This document defines a mechanism that provides simple but meaningful 
   information to a service retargeted-to user or application to 
   represent the most recent retarget of a request. The mechanism makes 
   use of the solution approach specified in [SRVCTRL], which provides 
   the flexibility to provide service retargeting information in SIP 
   requests. When used in conjunction with [HIST] it provides more 
   comprehensive information to the retargeted-to user or application 
   and also to the calling user or application. Although aimed primarily 
   at INVITE requests, it can in principle apply to other SIP methods. 
    
2 Requirements 
    
   REQ-1. When forwarding a service-retargeted request to a UAS, it must 
   be possible to include information that denotes the service reason 
   for service retargeting and the previous target, in order to assist 
   the user or application in determining how to behave, e.g.: 
    
   - how to respond to the request; 
   - in the case of an INVITE request that is answered, how to behave 
   during the established session (e.g., greeting to be given). 
    
   REQ-2. It must be possible to include this information in a service-
   retargeted request to a UAS also in the case where service 
   retargeting has been followed by retargeting that is not service 
   retargeting. 
    
   REQ-3. When a request from a UAC has been service-retargeted, it must 
   be possible to include information in a response that denotes the 
   reason for service retargeting and new target, in order to assist the 
   user in determining how to behave, e.g.: 
    
   - in the case of a failed request, under what circumstances it might 
   be appropriate to re-attempt the request (e.g., if retargeted because 
   of busy but the new target does not answer, it might be appropriate 
   to retry a few minutes later); 
   - in the case of an INVITE request that results in an established 
   session, whether to abandon that session and if so under what 
   circumstances it might be appropriate to re-attempt the request; 
   - in the case of an INVITE request that results in an established 
   session, how to behave during that session (e.g., greeting to be 
   given). 
    
   REQ-4. It must be possible to indicate that the reason for 
   retargeting is because there are no registered contacts for the URI.

                Indicating Service Retargeting in SIP    October 2005 
 
 
    
   REQ-5. It must be possible to indicate that the reason for 
   retargeting is because contacts for the URI are busy. 
    
   REQ-6. It must be possible to indicate that the reason for 
   retargeting is because the request was not answered during the 
   alerting period. 
    
   REQ-7. It must be possible to indicate that the reason for 
   retargeting is because the user has arranged for requests to be 
   retargeted irrespective of the state of registered contacts. 
    
   REQ-8. It must be possible to indicate that the reason for 
   retargeting is because the user declined the request during alerting. 
    
   REQ-9. It must be possible to indicate that the reason for 
   retargeting is because the user has arranged for requests to be 
   distributed among a number of targets. 
    
   REQ-10. It must be possible to indicate that the reason for 
   retargeting is because of network conditions. 
    
   REQ-11. It must be possible to indicate (e.g., by default) that there 
   is no service reason for retargeting. 
    
   REQ-12. It must be possible to extend the list of service retargeting 
   reasons in the future. 
    
   REQ-13. It must be possible to suppress information concerning 
   service retargeting in order to reflect network policy or respect the 
   wishes of the retargeted-from user. 
    
3 Overview of the solution 
    
   [SRVCTRL] describes how URI parameters can be used to control a 
   service or application at the UAS by providing appropriate context 
   information. It describes this only in principle, without assigning 
   any new URI parameter names or values. For a given deployment, the 
   principles can be used to achieve control of a service or application 
   by configuring the appropriate URI parameter names and values at the 
   equipment concerned or by using equipment with appropriate 
   capabilities from a single vendor. This requires a lot of 
   coordination for configuring the various pieces of equipment, 
   matching service URIs, mapping service URIs to phone numbers, etc. 
   Further standardisation is required to allow easy deployment of 
   equipment from different vendors and with various level of 
   capabilities.

                Indicating Service Retargeting in SIP    October 2005 
 
 
   The solution here adopts the principles of [SRVCTRL] and defines 
   parameter names and values for indicating retargeting details to a 
   service or application. This enhancement to SIP, when used alone, is 
   sufficient to satisfy the needs of some applications and can also 
   provide useful information to a retargeted-to user. When used in 
   conjunction with [HIST] it can provide very comprehensive information 
   not only to retargeted-to applications and users but also to source 
   applications and users. 
    
   When a request is service retargeted (for a reason meaningful to a 
   retargeted-to user or application), two parameters are added to the 
   retargeted-to URI: the old-target parameter contains the previous 
   target URI and the retargeting-reason parameter contains the reason 
   for service retargeting. Provided this is the last retarget, these 
   parameters will reach the UAS and can be provided to the user or 
   application. 
    
   This provides a simple means of satisfying the needs of certain 
   applications such as voice mail servers that just require information 
   about the most recent retarget in order to trigger appropriate 
   behaviour. 
    
   When retargeting occurs and a History-Info header field element is 
   added to record the retarget-to URI and the SIP reason that led to 
   retargeting, if the retargeting is service retargeting the old-target 
   and retargeting-reason parameters in the retargeted-to URI will also 
   appear in the History-Info header field element. If History-Info 
   header field elements are forwarded to the UAS, the UAS will be able 
   to see which retargets were service retargets and the service 
   retargeting reasons concerned. Likewise, if the History-Info header 
   field elements are sent back to the UAC, the UAC will be able to see 
   which retargets were service retargets. This information can be 
   presented to the user or application at the UAS or UAC. 
    
4 Behaviour 
    
4.1  UAC behaviour 
    
   A UAC MAY use service redirection information in a received History-
   Info header field to present to the user or application. 
    
     Note that when a UAC recurses as a result of receiving a 3xx 
     response, any service redirection information in the retargeted-to 
     URI (received in the Contact header field) will automatically be 
     copied into the Request URI. 
    
4.2 Proxy behaviour 
    

 
 
Elwell                   Expires - April 2006                 [Page 7] 
                Indicating Service Retargeting in SIP    October 2005 
 
 
   When retargeting a request for service reasons, a proxy MAY add an 
   old-target parameter and a retargeting-reason parameter to the new 
   target URI as placed in the Request-URI of the forwarded request. If 
   a new History-Info header field element is created to contain the new 
   target URI, this too MUST contain the same old-target and 
   retargeting-reason parameters. 
    
4.3 Redirect behaviour 
    
   When redirecting a request for service reasons, a redirect MAY add an 
   old-target parameter and a retargeting-reason parameter to any or all 
   URIs placed in the Contact URI header field in the 3xx response. 
    
4.4 UAS behaviour 
    
   A UAS MAY use service redirection information in a received Request-
   URI or History-Info header field to present to the user or 
   application. 
    
5 Syntax 
    
   This RFC updates the SIP URI parameters registry as defined in 
   [URIREG]. Two new URI parameters are defined. 
    
   URI parameter old-target, when present, means that the URI became the 
   target URI for the request (the new Request URI) as a result of 
   service retargeting and the URI parameter value was the Request URI 
   prior to service retargeting. 
    
   URI parameter retargeting-reason, when present, means that the URI 
   became the target URI for the request (the new Request URI) as a 
   result of service retargeting and the URI parameter value indicates 
   the reason for service retargeting. 
    
   The following retargeting-reason values are defined in this 
   specification: 
    
   no-contacts - service retargeting because there are no registered 
   contacts for the URI; 
    
   busy û service retargeting because contacts for the URI are busy; 
    
   no-reply û service retargeting because the request was not answered 
   during the alerting period; 
    
   unconditional û service retargeting because the user has arranged for 
   requests to be retargeted irrespective of the state of registered 
   contacts; 
    
 
 
Elwell                   Expires - April 2006                 [Page 8] 
                Indicating Service Retargeting in SIP    October 2005 
 
 
   declined û service retargeting because the user declined the request 
   during alerting; 
    
   distribution û service retargeting because the user has arranged for 
   requests to be distributed among a number of targets; 
    
   network û service retargeting because of network conditions. 
    
   If a received retargeting-reason value is not recognized it SHOULD be 
   treated as "unconditional". 
    
   The ABNF definition of these parameters is as follows. 
    
   uri-parameter      = transport-param / user-param / method-param 
                        / ttl-param / maddr-param / lr-param 
                        / old-target / retargeting-reason / other-param 
   old-target         = "old-target=" Request-URI 
   redirecting-reason = "redirecting-reason=" service-reason 
   service-reason     = ("no-contacts" / "busy" / "no-reply" 
                        / "unconditional" / "declined" / "distribution" 
                        / "network" / other-reason) 
   other-reason       = token 
    
6 PSTN Mapping 
    
   The mapping to the PSTN/ISDN protocols is important both for gateways 
   that connect the IP network to existing TDM equipment, such as PBXs 
   and voicemail systems, and for gateways that connect the IP network 
   to the PSTN/ISDN network.  Both Q.931 and ISUP have signaling for 
   this information that can be treated as roughly equivalent for the 
   purposes here. 
    
   For a service-retargeted call from SIP to PSTN/ISDN, the user portion 
   of the URI SHOULD be used as the address of the service retargeted-to 
   entity in the PSTN/ISDN, while the old-target SHOULD be mapped to the 
   PSTN/ISDN original redirecting number. 
    
   If the gateway and Proxy are in the same Trust Domain (defined in RFC 
   3325 [PASSERT]), and the Spec(T) includes compliance with that 
   specification, and the Spec(T) asserts that the Proxy will do 
   screening (whatever that means), then the gateway MAY claim that the 
   original redirecting number is screened; otherwise it SHOULD NOT 
   assert that the original redirecting number is screened. 
    
   The following SHOULD be used as the mapping from retargeting-reason 
   parameters to ISUP/Q.931/QSIG redirect reason codes:

   The redirection counters SHOULD be set to one unless additional 
   information is available. 
    
   For a call from PSTN/ISDN that has been redirected within the 
   PSTN/ISDN, information from the PSTN/ISDN MAY be used to indicate 
   service retargeting in the SIP INVITE request. In this case, the 
   original redirecting number SHOULD be used to derive the old-target 
   URI and the ISUP/Q.931/QSIG redirect reason code should be used to 
   derive the retargeting-reason, in accordance with the table above. 
    
   More comprehensive mapping to/from PSTN/ISDN may be achieved if the 
   History-Info header field is also taken into account (e.g., by taking 
   into account multiple service retargets and by mapping information 
   sent towards the calling party). This is outside the scope of this 
   document.

7 Examples 
    
   This section provides some example use cases for the solution 
   proposed in this document.  The examples are intended to highlight 
   the potential applicability of this solution and are not intended to 
   limit its applicability.  The term "deputy" is used to define the 
   role of a recipient UA, after retargeting, in several of the 
   examples.  This term is intended to represent a general role of an 
   entity that could be an automata (eg. voicemail server) or another 
   person, such as another member of a work group (e.g. supervisor) or 
   agent in a call center application, etc.. 
    
   Also the examples show just service retargeting on busy, but can 
   easily be adapted to show other forms of service retargeting. 
    
7.1 Proxy forwards busy to deputy 
    
   In this example, Alice calls Bob. BobÆs proxy determines that Bob is 
   busy, and the proxy forwards the call to Bob's deputy (or voice 
   mail).  Alice's phone is at 192.168.0.1 while Bob's phone is at 
   192.168.0.2.  The important thing to note is the URI in message F7.

7.2 Endpoint forwards busy to deputy 
    
   In this example, Alice calls Bob. Bob is busy, but forwards the 
   session directly to his deputy (or voicemail).  Alice's phone is at 
   192.168.0.1 while Bob's phone is at 192.168.0.2.  The important thing 
   to note is the URI in the Contact in message F3.

7.3 Endpoint forwards busy to TDM via a gateway 
    
   In this example, the deputy (or mailbox) is reached via a gateway to 
   a TDM network.  Bob's number is +1 555 555-1002, while deputy's 
   number on the TDM network is +1-555-555-2000. 
    
   The call flow is the same as in section 7.2 except for the Contact 
   URI in F3 and the Request URI in F7.

8 IANA considerations 
    
   This specification adds a new value to the IANA registration in the 
   "SIP/SIPS URI Parameters" sub-registry at 
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters as defined in 
   [URIREG]. 
    
    
         Parameter Name      Predefined Values  Reference 
          
         old-target             No              [RFCAAAA] 
         retargeting-reason     Yes             [RFCAAAA] 
    
      [Note to IANA: Please replace AAAA with the RFC number of this 
      specification. 
    
   This document requests that IANA create a new registry for 
   retargeting-reason values. Each registry entry must contain the value 
   and the specification in which the value is defined. New values for 
   this registry may be defined only in Standards Track RFCs. This 
   registry is to be populated initially with the following entries 
   defined in section 5: no-contacts; busy; no-reply; unconditional; 
   declined; distribution; network. 
    
9 Security Considerations 
    
   This draft discusses transactions involving at least three parties, 
   which increases the complexity of the privacy issues. In addition, 
   the security considerations of [HIST] apply when the History-Info 
   header field is used. 
    
   The new URI parameters defined in this draft are generally sent from 
   a Proxy or call control system to a retargeted-to UA (or to a gateway 
   to the PSTN and then to a retargeted-to device).  These new 
   parameters tell the retargeted-to UA what service the proxy wishes to 
   have performed.  Just as any message sent from the proxy to the 
   retargeted-to UA needs to be integrity protected, these messages need 
   to be integrity protected to stop attackers from, for example, 
   causing speech (e.g., voicemail) meant for a company's CEO to go to 
   an attacker.  RFC 3261 provides a TLS mechanism suitable for 
   performing this integrity protection. 
    
   The signaling from the Proxy to the retargeted-to UA will reveal who 
   is calling whom and possibly some information about a user's presence 
   based on whether the call was answered or retargeted.  This 
   information can be protected by encrypting the SIP traffic between 
   the Proxy and the retargeted-to UA.  Again, RFC 3261 contains 
   mechanisms for accomplishing this using TLS.

   The S/MIME based mechanisms in RFC 3261 will generally not be 
   applicable for protecting this information because they are meant for 
   end to end issues and this is primarily a middle to end scenario. 
   Without end-to-end or middle-to-end security, reliance is placed on 
   on hop-by-hop security using TLS and the SIPS URI scheme. This 
   requires that all hops between the Proxy and the retareget-to UR be 
   trusted, which is the case in many deployment scenarios. 
    
9.1 Integrity Protection of Forwarding in SIP 
    
   The forwarding of a call in SIP brings up a very strange trust issue. 
   Consider the normal case when A calls B and the call gets forwarded 
   to C by a network element in B's domain, and then C answers the call. 
   A has called B but ended up talking to C. This scenario may be hard 
   to separate from a man in the middle attack. 
    
   There are two possible solutions.  One is that B sends back 
   information to A saying don't call me, call C and signs it as B. The 
   problem is that this solution involves revealing that B has forwarded 
   to C, which B often may not want to do.  For example, B may be a work 
   phone that has been forwarded to a mobile or home phone.  The user 
   does not want to reveal their mobile or home phone number but, even 
   more importantly, does not want to reveal that they are not in the 
   office. 
    
   The other possible solution is that A needs to trust B only to 
   forward to a trusted identity.  This requires a hop by hop transitive 
   trust such that each hop will only send to a trusted next hop and 
   each hop will only do things that the user at that hop desired.  This 
   solution is enforced in SIP using the SIPS URI and TLS based hop by 
   hop security.  It protects from an off axis attack, but if one of the 
   hops is not trustworthy, the call may be diverted to an attacker. 
    
   Any redirection of a call to an attacker's mailbox is serious.  It is 
   trivial for an attacker to make its mailbox seem very much like the 
   real mailbox and forward the messages to the real mailbox so that the 
   fact that the messages have been intercepted or even tampered with 
   escapes detection. 
    
9.2 Privacy Related Issues on the Second Call Leg 
    
   When A calls B and gets redirected to C, occasionally people say 
   there is a requirement for the call leg from B to C to be anonymous. 
   This is not the PSTN and there is no call leg from B to C; instead 
   there is a VoIP session between A and C. If A had put a To header 
   containing B in the initial invite message, unless something special 
   is done about it, C will see that To header.  If the person who 
   answers phone C says "I think you dialed the wrong number, who were 
   you trying to reach?"  A will probably specify B. 
 
 
Elwell                   Expires - April 2006                [Page 18] 
                Indicating Service Retargeting in SIP    October 2005 
 
 
    
   If A does not want C to see that the call was to B, A needs a special 
   relationship with the forwarding Proxy to induce it not to reveal 
   that information.  The call should go through an anonymizer service 
   that provides session or user level privacy (as described in [PRIV] 
   [4]) service before going to C. It is not hard to figure out how to 
   meet this requirement, but it is unclear why anyone would want this 
   service. 
    
   The scenario in which B wants to make sure that C does not see that 
   the call was to B is easier to deal with but a bit weird.  The usual 
   argument is B wants to forward his phone to C but does not want C to 
   find out his phone number.  It is hard to imagine that C would want 
   to accept all BÆs calls without knowing how to call B to complain.  
   Several popular web portals will send SMS alert message about things 
   like stock prices and weather to mobile phone users today.  Some of 
   these contain no information about the account on the web portal that 
   initiated them, making it nearly impossible for the mobile phone 
   owner to stop them.  This anonymous message forwarding has turned out 
   to be a really bad idea even where no malice is present.  Clearly 
   some people are fairly dubious about the need for this, but never 
   mind: let's look at how it is solved. 
    
   In the general case, the proxy needs to route the call through an 
   Anonymization Service and everything will be cleaned up.  Any 
   Anonymization service that performs the "Privacy: Header" Service in 
   [PRIV] MUST remove the reason and target URI parameters from the URI.  
   [PRIV] already makes it clear you would need to clean up this sort of 
   information. 
    
   There is a specialized case of some interest in which the mechanisms 
   in this specification are being used in conjunction with [PRIV], and 
   the retargeted-to UA and the Proxy are both in the trust domain.  In 
   this limited case, the problem that B does not want to reveal their 
   address to C can be solved by ensuring that the target parameter URI 
   should never be in a message that is forwarded outside the trust 
   domain.  If it is passed to a PSTN device in the trust domain, the 
   appropriate privacy flag needs to be set in the ISUP or ISDN 
   signaling. 
    
   In several scenarios it is possible that a service retargeted-to user 
   will receive unwanted calls. Arranging for automatic rejection of 
   such calls can alleviate the problem, although it would be preferable 
   to take steps to prevent the service retargeting, e.g., by contacting 
   the retargeting user. Of course, if for privacy reasons service 
   retargeting information is not provided, this will not be possible.

13 Appendix - Rejected Alternatives (temporary û to be removed) 
    
   The following alternative solutions were considered and rejected.

13.1 Extending the SIP Reason header 
    
   This alternative involves defining a new "protocol" (namespace) in 
   the SIP Reason header for service retargeting reasons. A service-
   retargeted request could then convey, as a URI header in the History-
   Info header field, a Reason header field indicating the service 
   retargeting reason, in addition to the SIP reason for retargeting. In 
   addition, the Reason header field could be used in a 3xx response to 
   indicate a service reason for redirection. This was considered to 
   have the following disadvantages: 
    
   - It is not backwards compatible with existing UACs or proxies, which 
   would not copy a Reason header from a 3xx response into a History-
   Info header field when recursing. 
    
   - The need for escape characters in URI headers makes this less 
   readable. 
    
   - It does not provide a basic level of support to applications at the 
   UAS without requiring use of the History-Info header field. 
    
13.2 New 3xx response codes 
    
   There are many unused response codes in the 3xx range, and a few of 
   these could have been used for service retargeting reasons. This was 
   considered to have the following disadvantages: 
    
   - Service reasons for retargeting are in some ways orthogonal to SIP 
   reasons, and it would be unwise to mix the two in the same namespace. 
    
   - There may be advantages in having both a SIP retargeting reason and 
   a service retargeting reason available. 
    
   - It does not provide a basic level of support to applications at the 
   UAS without requiring use of the History-Info header field.
