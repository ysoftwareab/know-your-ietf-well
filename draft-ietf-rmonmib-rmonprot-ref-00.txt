2.  Abstract

This memo defines a notation describing protocol layers in a protocol
encapsulation, specifically for use in encoding INDEX values for the
protocolDirTable, found in the RMON-2 MIB [RFC2021]. The definitions for
the standard protocol directory base layer identifiers are also
included.

The first version of the RMON Protocol Identifiers Document [RFC2074]
has been split into a standards-track Reference portion (this document),
and an Informational document. The RMON Protocol Identifier Macros
document [RMONPROT_MAC] now contains the non-normative portion of that
specification.

4.  The SNMP Network Management Framework

The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
components:

  o  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [RFC2271].

  o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
     purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
     Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in RFC
     1155 [RFC1155], RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 1215 [RFC1215]. The
     second version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [RFC1902],
     RFC 1903 [RFC1903] and RFC 1904 [RFC1904].

  o  Message protocols for transferring management information. The
     first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
     described in RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second version of the SNMP
     message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
     protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901] and
     RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the message protocol is
     called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906], RFC 2272
     [RFC2272] and RFC 2274 [RFC2274].

  o  Protocol operations for accessing management information. The first
     set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described
     in RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second set of protocol operations and
     associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

  o  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [RFC2273]
     and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2275
     [RFC2275].

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are defined
using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

Internet-Draft             RMON PI Reference               November 1998


This memo does not specify a MIB module.

5.  Overview

The RMON-2 MIB [RFC2021] uses hierarchically formatted OCTET STRINGs to
globally identify individual protocol encapsulations in the
protocolDirTable.

This guide contains algorithms and the authoritative set of base layer
protocol identifier macros, for use within INDEX values in the
protocolDirTable.

This is the the second revision of this document, and is intended to
replace the first half the RMON-2 Protocol Identifiers document
[RFC2074].


5.1.  Terms

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


Several terms are used throughout this document, as well as in the
RMON-2 MIB [RFC2021], that should be introduced:

parent protocol:
     Also called 'parent'; The encapsulating protocol identifier for a
     specific protocol layer, e.g., IP is the parent protocol of UDP.
     Note that base layers cannot have parent protocols.  This term may
     be used to refer to a specific encapsulating protocol, or it may be
     used generically to refer to any encapsulating protocol.

child protocol:
     Also called 'child'; An encapsulated protocol identifier for a
     specific protocol layer. e.g., UDP is a child protocol of IP.  This
     term may be used to refer to a specific encapsulated protocol, or
     it may be used generically to refer to any encapsulated protocol.

layer-identifier:
     An octet string fragment representing a particular protocol
     encapsulation layer or sub-layer. A fragment consists of exactly
     four octets, encoded in network byte order.  If present, child
     layer-identifiers for a protocol MUST have unique values among each

Internet-Draft             RMON PI Reference               November 1998


     other. (See section 6.3 for more details.)

protocol:
     A particular protocol layer, as specified by encoding rules in this
     document. Usually refers to a single layer in a given
     encapsulation. Note that this term is sometimes used in the RMON-2
     MIB [RFC2021] to name a fully-specified protocol-identifier string.
     In such a case, the protocol-identifier string is named for its
     upper-most layer. A named protocol may also refer to any
     encapsulation of that protocol.

protocol-identifier string:
     An octet string representing a particular protocol encapsulation,
     as specified by the encoding rules in this document. This string is
     identified in the RMON-2 MIB [RFC2021] as the protocolDirID object.
     A protocol-identifier string is composed of one or more layer-
     identifiers read from left to right. The left-most layer-identifier
     specifies a base layer encapsulation. Each layer-identifier to the
     right specifies a child layer protocol encapsulation.

protocol-identifier macro:
     Also called a PI macro; A macro-like textual construct used to
     describe a particular networking protocol. Only protocol attributes
     which are important for RMON use are documented. Note that the term
     'macro' is historical, and PI macros are not real macros, nor are
     they ASN.1 macros. The current set of published RMON PI macros can
     be found in the RMON Protocol Identifier Macros document
     [RMONPROT_MAC].

     The PI macro serves several purposes:

     - Names the protocol for use within the RMON-2 MIB [RFC2021].
     - Describes how the protocol is encoded into an octet string.
     - Describes how child protocols are identified (if applicable),
       and encoded into an octet string.
     - Describes which protocolDirParameters are allowed for the protocol.
     - Describes how the associated protocolDirType object is encoded
       for the protocol.
     - Provides reference(s) to authoritative documentation for the
       protocol.


protocol-variant-identifier macro:
     Also called a PI-variant macro; A special kind of PI macro, used to
     describe a particular protocol layer, which cannot be identified





Expires May 1999                                                [Page 6]





Internet-Draft             RMON PI Reference               November 1998


     with a deterministic, and (usually) hierarchical structure, like
     most networking protocols.

     Note that the PI-variant macro and the PI-macro are defined with a
     single set of syntax rules (see section 6.2), except that different
     sub-clauses are required for each type.

     A protocol identified with a PI-variant macro is actually a variant
     of a well known encapsulation that may be present in the
     protocolDirTable. This is used to document the IANA assigned
     protocols, which are needed to identify protocols which cannot be
     practically identified by examination of 'appropriate network
     traffic' (e.g. the packets which carry them). All other protocols
     (which can be identified by examination of appropriate network
     traffic) SHOULD be documented using the protocol-identifier macro.
     (See section 6.2 for details.)

protocol-parameter:
     A single octet, corresponding to a specific layer-identifier in the
     protocol-identifier. This octet is a bit-mask indicating special
     functions or capabilities that this agent is providing for the
     corresponding protocol.  (See section 6.2.6 for details.)

protocol-parameters string:
     An octet string, which contains one protocol-parameter for each
     layer-identifier in the protocol-identifier.  This string is
     identified in the RMON-2 MIB [RFC2021] as the protocolDirParameters
     object. (See the section 6.2.6 for details.)

protocolDirTable INDEX:
     A protocol-identifier and protocol-parameters octet string pair
     that have been converted to an INDEX value, according to the
     encoding rules in in section 7.7 of RFC 1902 [RFC1902].

pseudo-protocol:
     A convention or algorithm used only within this document for the
     purpose of encoding protocol-identifier strings.

protocol encapsulation tree:
     Protocol encapsulations can be organized into an inverted rooted
     tree. The nodes of the root are the base encapsulations. The
     children nodes, if any, of a node in the tree are the
     encapsulations of child protocols.

5.2.  Relationship to the Remote Network Monitoring MIB

This document is intended to identify the encoding rules for the OCTET
STRING objects protocolDirID and protocolDirParameters.  RMON-2 tables,
such as those in the new Protocol Distribution, Host, and Matrix groups,
use a local INTEGER INDEX (protocolDirLocalIndex) rather than complete
protocolDirTable INDEX strings, to identify protocols for counting
purposes.  Only the protocolDirTable uses the protocolDirID and
protocolDirParameters strings described in this document.

This document is intentionally separated from the RMON-2 MIB objects
[RFC2021] to allow updates to this document without any republication of
MIB objects.

This document does not discuss auto-discovery and auto-population of the
protocolDirTable. This functionality is not explicitly defined by the
RMON standard. An agent SHOULD populate the directory with the
'interesting' protocols on which the intended applications depend.


5.3.  Relationship to the RMON Protocol Identifier Macros Document

The original RMON Protocol Identifiers document [RFC2074] contains the
protocol directory reference material, as well as many examples of
protocol identifier macros.

These macros have been moved to a separate document called the RMON
Protocol Identifier Macros document [RMONPROT_MAC]. This will allow the
normative text (this document) to advance on the standards track with
the RMON-2 MIB [RFC2021], while the collection of PI macros is
maintained in an Informational RFC.

The PI Macros document is intentionally separated from this document to
allow frequent updates to the list of published PI macros without any
republication of MIB objects or encoding rules. Protocol Identifier
macros submitted from the RMON working group and community at large (to
the RMONMIB WG mailing list at 'rmonmib@cisco.com') will be collected,
screened by the RMONMIB working group, and (if approved) added to a
subsequent version of the PI Macros document.

Macros submissions will be collected in the IANA's MIB files under the
directory "ftp://ftp.isi.edu/mib/rmonmib/rmon2_pi_macros/" and in the
RMONMIB working group mailing list message archive file
"ftp://ftpeng.cisco.com/ftp/rmonmib/rmonmib".

Internet-Draft             RMON PI Reference               November 1998


5.4.  Relationship to the ATM-RMON MIB

The ATM Forum has standardized "Remote Monitoring MIB Extensions for ATM
Networks" (ATM-RMON MIB)  [AF-NM-TEST-0080.000], which provides RMON-
like stats, host, matrix, and matrixTopN capability for NSAP address-
based (ATM Adaption Layer 5, AAL-5) cell traffic.

5.4.1.  Port Aggregation

It it possible to correlate ATM-RMON MIB data with packet-based RMON-2
[RFC2021] collections, but only if the ATM-RMON 'portSelGrpTable' and
'portSelTable' are configured to provide the same level of port
aggregation as used in the packet-based collection.  This will require
an ATM-RMON 'portSelectGroup' to contain a single port, in the case of
traditional RMON dataSources.

5.4.2.  Encapsulation Mappings

The RMON PI document does not contain explicit PI macro support for
"Multiprotocol Encapsulation over ATM Adaptation Layer 5" [RFC1483], or
ATM Forum "LAN Emulation over ATM" (LANE) [AF-LANE-0021.000].  Instead,
a probe must 'fit' the ATM encapsulation to one of the base layers
defined in this document (i.e., llc, snap, or vsnap), regardless of how
the raw data is obtained by the agent (e.g., VC-muxing vs. LLC-muxing,
or routed vs. bridged formats).  See section 6.2 for details on
identifying and decoding a particular base layer.

An NMS can determine some of the omitted encapsulation details by
examining the interface type (ifType) of the dataSource for a particular
RMON collection:

   RFC 1483 dataSource ifTypes:
        - aal5(49)

   LANE dataSource ifTypes:
        - aflane8023(59)
        - aflane8025(60)

These dataSources require implementation of the ifStackTable from the
Interfaces MIB [RFC2233].  It is possible that some implementations will
use dataSource values which indicate an ifType of 'atm(37)' (because the
ifStackTable is not supported), however this is strongly discouraged by
the RMONMIB WG.

Internet-Draft             RMON PI Reference               November 1998


5.4.3.  Counting ATM Traffic in RMON-2 Collections

The RMON-2 Application Layer (AL) and Network Layer (NL)
(host/matrix/topN) tables require that octet counters be incremented by
the size of the particular frame, not by the size of the frame
attributed to a given protocol.

Probe implementations must use the AAL-5 frame size (not the AAL-5
payload size or encapsulated MAC frame size) as the 'frame size' for the
purpose of incrementing RMON-2 octet counters (e.g., 'nlHostInOctets',
'alHostOutOctets').

The RMONMIB WG has not addressed issues relating to packet capture of
AAL-5 based traffic. Therefore, it is an implementation-specific matter
whether padding octets (i.e., RFC 1483 VC-muxed, bridged 802.3 or 802.5
traffic, or LANE traffic) are represented in the RMON-1
'captureBufferPacketData' MIB object.   Normally, the first octet of the
captured frame is the first octet of the destination MAC address (DA).


5.5.  Relationship to Other MIBs

The RMON Protocol Identifiers Reference document is intended for use
with the protocolDirTable within the RMON MIB. It is not relevant to any
other MIB, or intended for use with any other MIB.

6.  Protocol Identifier Encoding

The protocolDirTable is indexed by two OCTET STRINGs, protocolDirID and
protocolDirParameters. To encode the table index, each variable-length
string is converted to an OBJECT IDENTIFIER fragment, according to the
encoding rules in section 7.7 of RFC 1902 [RFC1902]. Then the index
fragments are simply concatenated. (Refer to figures 1a - 1d below for
more detail.)

The first OCTET STRING (protocolDirID) is composed of one or more 4-
octet "layer-identifiers". The entire string uniquely identifies a
particular node in the protocol encapsulation tree. The second OCTET
STRING, (protocolDirParameters) which contains a corresponding number of
1-octet protocol-specific parameters, one for each 4-octet layer-
identifier in the first string.

A protocol layer is normally identified by a single 32-bit value.  Each
layer-identifier is encoded in the ProtocolDirID OCTET STRING INDEX as
four sub-components [ a.b.c.d ], where 'a' - 'd' represent each byte of

the 32-bit value in network byte order.  If a particular protocol layer
cannot be encoded into 32 bits, then it must be defined as an
'ianaAssigned' protocol (see below for details on IANA assigned
protocols).

The following figures show the differences between the OBJECT IDENTIFIER
and OCTET STRING encoding of the protocol identifier string.

     N is the number of protocol-layer-identifiers required
     for the entire encapsulation of the named protocol.  Note
     that the layer following the base layer usually identifies
     a network layer protocol, but this is not always the case,
     (most notably for children of the 'vsnap' base-layer).

     When encoded in a protocolDirTable INDEX, each of the two
     strings must be preceded by a length sub-component. In this
     example, N equals '4', the first 'cnt' field would contain
     the value '16', and the second 'cnt' field would contain
     the value '4'.

Note that these two strings would not be concatenated together if ever
returned in a GetResponse PDU, since they are different MIB objects.
However, protocolDirID and protocolDirParameters are not currently

6.2.  Protocol Identifier Macro Format

The following example is meant to introduce the protocol-identifier
macro. This macro-like construct is used to represent both protocols and
protocol-variants.

If the 'VariantOfPart' component of the macro is present, then the macro
represents a protocol-variant instead of a protocol.  This clause is
currently used only for IANA assigned protocols, enumerated under the
'ianaAssigned' base-layer.  The VariantOfPart component MUST be present
for IANA assigned protocols.

6.2.1.  Lexical Conventions

The PI language defines the following keywords:

      ADDRESS-FORMAT
      ATTRIBUTES
      CHILDREN
      DECODING
      DESCRIPTION
      PARAMETERS
      PROTOCOL-IDENTIFIER
      REFERENCE
      VARIANT-OF

The PI language defines the following punctuation elements:

     {     left curly brace
     }     right curly brace
     (     left parenthesis
     )     right parenthesis
     ,     comma
     ::=   two colons and an equal sign
     --    two dashes


6.2.2.  Notation for Syntax Descriptions

An extended form of the BNF notation is used to specify the syntax of
the PI language. The rules for this notation are shown below:

  *  Literal values are specified in quotes, for example "REFERENCE"

  *  Replaceable items are surrounded by less than (<) and greater than
     (>) characters, for example <parmList>

  *  Defined items are specified without surrounding quotes or less than
     and greater than characters, for example 'lcname'

  *  A vertical bar (|) is used to indicate a choice between items, for
     example 'number | hstr'

  *  Ellipsis are used to indicate that the previous item may be
     repeated one or more times, for example <parm>...

  *  Square brackets are used to enclose optional items, for example [
     "," <parm> ]

  *  An equals character (=) is used to mean "defined as," for example

6.2.3.  Grammar for the PI Language

The following are "defined items" or "terminals" of the grammar and are
identical to the same lexical elements from the MIB module language,
except for hstr and pname:
    lcname - name starting with a lower-case letter, and may contain
             letters, digits, and dash characters (-)
    pname  - name starting with a letter or digit, and may contain
             letters, digits, dashes (-), underbars (_), asterisks (*),
             and pluses (+) (See section 6.2.4)
    number - an unsigned decimal number between 0 and 4g-1
    hstr   - an unsigned hexadecimal number between 0 and 4g-1
             (note: the format is that used in the ANSI C programming
             language. For example, 0x04 has the value of 4.)
    string - a quoted string

The following is the extended BNF notation for the grammar with starting
symbol <piFile>:

    -- a file containing one or more Protocol Identifier (PI) definitions
    <piFile> = <piDefinition>...

    -- a PI definition
    <piDefinition> =

Internet-Draft             RMON PI Reference               November 1998


6.2.4.  Mapping of the Protocol Name

The "protoName" value, called the "protocol name" shall be an ASCII
string consisting of one up to 64 characters from the following:

     "A" through "Z"
     "a" through "z"
     "0" through "9"
     dash (-)
     underbar (_)
     asterisk (*)
     plus(+)

The first character of the protocol name is limited to one of the
following:

     "A" through "Z"
     "a" through "z"
     "0" through "9"

This value SHOULD be the name or acronym identifying the protocol.  Note
that case is significant.  The value selected for the protocol name
SHOULD match the "most well-known" name or acronym for the indicated
protocol.  For example, the document indicated by the URL:

    ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/protocol-numbers

defines IP Protocol field values, so protocol-identifier macros for
children of IP SHOULD be given names consistent with the protocol names
found in this authoritative document. Likewise, children of UDP and TCP
SHOULD be given names consistent with the port number name assignments
found in:

    ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/port-numbers

When the "well-known name" contains characters not allowed in protocol
names, they MUST be changed to a dash character ("-") . In the event
that the first character must be changed, the protocol name is prepended
with the letter "p", so the former first letter may be changed to a
dash.

For example, z39.50 becomes z39-50 and 914c/g becomes 914c-g.  The
following protocol names are legal:

    ftp, ftp-data, whois++, sql*net, 3com-tsmux, ocs_cmu

Internet-Draft             RMON PI Reference               November 1998


Note that it is possible in actual implementation that different
encapsulations of the same protocol (which are represented by different
entries in the protocolDirTable) will be assigned the same protocol
name.  The protocolDirID INDEX value defines a particular protocol, not
the protocol name string.

6.2.5.  Mapping of the VARIANT-OF Clause

This clause is present for IANA assigned protocols only.  It identifies
the protocol-identifier macro that most closely represents this
particular protocol, and is known as the "reference protocol".  A
protocol-identifier macro MUST exist for the reference protocol.  When
this clause is present in a protocol-identifier macro, the macro is
called a 'protocol-variant-identifier'.

Any clause (e.g. CHILDREN, ADDRESS-FORMAT) in the reference protocol-
identifier macro SHOULD NOT be duplicated in the protocol-variant-
identifier macro, if the 'variant' protocols' semantics are identical
for a given clause.

Since the PARAMETERS and ATTRIBUTES clauses MUST be present in a
protocol-identifier, an empty 'ParamList' and 'AttrList' (i.e.
"PARAMETERS {}") MUST be present in a protocol-variant-identifier macro,
and the 'ParamList' and 'AttrList' found in the reference protocol-
identifier macro examined instead.

Note that if an 'ianaAssigned' protocol is defined that is not a variant
of any other documented protocol, then the protocol-identifier macro
SHOULD be used instead of the protocol-variant-identifier version of the
macro.

6.2.6.  Mapping of the PARAMETERS Clause

The protocolDirParameters object provides an NMS the ability to turn on
and off expensive probe resources. An agent may support a given
parameter all the time, not at all, or subject to current resource load.

The PARAMETERS clause is a list of bit definitions which can be directly
encoded into the associated ProtocolDirParameters octet in network byte
order. Zero or more bit definitions may be present. Only bits 0-7 are
valid encoding values. This clause defines the entire BIT set allowed
for a given protocol. A conforming agent may choose to implement a
subset of zero or more of these PARAMETERS.

By convention, the following common bit definitions are used by

different protocols.  These bit positions MUST NOT be used for other
parameters. They MUST be reserved if not used by a given protocol.

Bits are encoded in a single octet. Bit 0 is the high order (left-most)
bit in the octet, and bit 7 is the low order (right-most) bit in the
first octet. Reserved bits and unspecified bits in the octet are set to
zero.

         Table 3.1  Reserved PARAMETERS Bits

     Bit Name              Description
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

                           this protocol will be counted correctly even
                           if this protocol fragments the upper layers
                           into multiple packets.
     1   tracksSessions    correctly attributes all packets of a protocol
                           which starts sessions on well known ports or
                           sockets and then transfers them to dynamically
                           assigned ports or sockets thereafter (e.g. TFTP).


The PARAMETERS clause MUST be present in all protocol-identifier macro
declarations, but may be equal to zero (empty).

6.2.6.1.  Mapping of the 'countsFragments(0)' BIT

This bit indicates whether the probe is correctly attributing all
fragmented packets of the specified protocol, even if individual frames
carrying this protocol cannot be identified as such.  Note that the
probe is not required to actually present any re-assembled datagrams
(for address-analysis, filtering, or any other purpose) to the NMS.

This bit MUST only be set in a protocolDirParameters octet which
corresponds to a protocol that supports fragmentation and reassembly in
some form. Note that TCP packets are not considered 'fragmented-streams'
and so TCP is not eligible.

This bit may be set in at most one protocolDirParameters octet within a
protocolDirTable INDEX.

Internet-Draft             RMON PI Reference               November 1998


6.2.6.2.  Mapping of the 'tracksSessions(1)' BIT

The 'tracksSessions(1)' bit indicates whether frames which are part of
remapped-sessions (e.g. TFTP download sessions) are correctly counted by
the probe. For such a protocol, the probe must usually analyze all
packets received on the indicated interface, and maintain some state
information, (e.g. the remapped UDP port number for TFTP).

The semantics of the 'tracksSessions' parameter are independent of the
other protocolDirParameters definitions, so this parameter MAY be
combined with any other legal parameter configurations.

6.2.7.  Mapping of the ATTRIBUTES Clause

The protocolDirType object provides an NMS with an indication of a
probe's capabilities for decoding a given protocol, or the general
attributes of the particular protocol.

The ATTRIBUTES clause is a list of bit definitions which are encoded
into the associated instance of ProtocolDirType. The BIT definitions are
specified in the SYNTAX clause of the protocolDirType MIB object.

         Table 3.2  Reserved ATTRIBUTES Bits
         ------------------------------------

     Bit Name              Description
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     0  hasChildren        indicates that there may be children of
                           this protocol defined in the protocolDirTable
                           (by either the agent or the manager).
     1  addressRecognitionCapable
                           indicates that this protocol can be used
                           to generate host and matrix table entries.


The ATTRIBUTES clause MUST be present in all protocol-identifier macro
declarations, but MAY be empty.


6.2.8.  Mapping of the DESCRIPTION Clause

The DESCRIPTION clause provides a textual description of the protocol
identified by this macro.  Notice that it SHOULD NOT contain details
about items covered by the CHILDREN, ADDRESS-FORMAT, DECODING and
REFERENCE clauses.

Internet-Draft             RMON PI Reference               November 1998


The DESCRIPTION clause MUST be present in all protocol-identifier macro
declarations.

6.2.9.  Mapping of the CHILDREN Clause

The CHILDREN clause provides a description of child protocols for
protocols which support them. It has three sub-sections:

  -  Details on the field(s)/value(s) used to select the child protocol,
     and how that selection process is performed

  -  Details on how the value(s) are encoded in the protocol identifier
     octet string

  -  Details on how child protocols are named with respect to their
     parent protocol label(s)

The CHILDREN clause MUST be present in all protocol-identifier macro
declarations in which the 'hasChildren(0)' BIT is set in the ATTRIBUTES
clause.

6.2.10.  Mapping of the ADDRESS-FORMAT Clause

The ADDRESS-FORMAT clause provides a description of the OCTET-STRING
format(s) used when encoding addresses.

This clause MUST be present in all protocol-identifier macro
declarations in which the 'addressRecognitionCapable(1)' BIT is set in
the ATTRIBUTES clause.

6.2.11.  Mapping of the DECODING Clause

The DECODING clause provides a description of the decoding procedure for
the specified protocol. It contains useful decoding hints for the
implementor, but SHOULD NOT over-replicate information in documents
cited in the REFERENCE clause.  It might contain a complete description
of any decoding information required.

For 'extensible' protocols ('hasChildren(0)' BIT set) this includes
offset and type information for the field(s) used for child selection as
well as information on determining the start of the child protocol.

For 'addressRecognitionCapable' protocols this includes offset and type
information for the field(s) used to generate addresses.

Internet-Draft             RMON PI Reference               November 1998


The DECODING clause is optional, and MAY be omitted if the REFERENCE
clause contains pointers to decoding information for the specified
protocol.

6.2.12.  Mapping of the REFERENCE Clause

If a publicly available reference document exists for this protocol it
SHOULD be listed here.  Typically this will be a URL if possible; if not
then it will be the name and address of the controlling body.

The CHILDREN, ADDRESS-FORMAT, and DECODING clauses SHOULD limit the
amount of information which may currently be obtained from an
authoritative document, such as the Assigned Numbers document [RFC1700].
Any duplication or paraphrasing of information should be brief and
consistent with the authoritative document.

The REFERENCE clause is optional, but SHOULD be implemented if an
authoritative reference exists for the protocol (especially for standard
protocols).

6.3.  Evaluating an Index of the  ProtocolDirectoryTable

The following evaluation is done after protocolDirTable INDEX value has
been converted into two OCTET STRINGs according to the INDEX encoding
rules specified in the SMI [RFC1902].

Protocol-identifiers are evaluated left to right, starting with the
protocolDirID, which length MUST be evenly divisible by four. The
protocolDirParameters length MUST be exactly one quarter of the
protocolDirID string length.

Protocol-identifier parsing starts with the base layer identifier, which
MUST be present, and continues for one or more upper layer identifiers,
until all OCTETs of the protocolDirID have been used. Layers MAY NOT be
skipped, so identifiers such as 'SNMP over IP' or 'TCP over ether2' can
not exist.

The base-layer-identifier also contains a 'special function identifier'
which may apply to the rest of the protocol identifier.

Wild-carding at the base layer within a protocol encapsulation is the
only supported special function at this time. (See section 7.1.1.2 for
details.)

After the protocol-identifier string (which is the value of

Internet-Draft             RMON PI Reference               November 1998


protocolDirID) has been parsed, each octet of the protocol-parameters
string is evaluated, and applied to the corresponding protocol layer.

A protocol-identifier label MAY map to more than one value.  For
instance, 'ip' maps to 5 distinct values, one for each supported
encapsulation.  (see the 'IP' section under 'L3 Protocol Identifiers' in
the RMON Protocol Identifier Macros document [RMONPROT_MAC]).

It is important to note that these macros are conceptually expanded at
implementation time, not at run time.

If all the macros are expanded completely by substituting all possible
values of each label for each child protocol, a list of all possible
protocol-identifiers is produced.  So 'ip' would result in 5 distinct
protocol-identifiers.  Likewise each child of 'ip' would map to at least
5 protocol-identifiers, one for each encapsulation (e.g. ip over ether2,
ip over LLC, etc.).


7.  Base Layer Protocol Identifier Macros

The following PROTOCOL IDENTIFIER macros can be used to construct
protocolDirID and protocolDirParameters strings.

An identifier is encoded by constructing the base-identifier, then
adding one layer-identifier for each encapsulated protocol.

Refer to the RMON Protocol Identifier Macros document [RMONPROT_MAC] for
a listing of the non-base layer PI macros published by the working
group. Note that other PI macro documents may exist, and it should be
possible for an implementor to populate the protocolDirTable without the
use of the PI Macro document [RMONPROT_MAC].


7.1.  Base Identifier Encoding

The first layer encapsulation is called the base identifier and it
contains optional protocol-function information and the base layer (e.g.
MAC layer) enumeration value used in this protocol identifier.

The base identifier is encoded as four octets as shown in figure 2.

     |   |   |   |   |
     +---+---+---+---+ octet
     | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | count

The first octet ('f') is the special function code, found in table 4.1.
The next two octets ('op1' and 'op2') are operands for the indicated
function. If not used, an operand must be set to zero.  The last octet,
'm', is the enumerated value for a particular base layer encapsulation,
found in table 4.2.  All four octets are encoded in network-byte-order.

7.1.1.  Protocol Identifier Functions

The base layer identifier contains information about any special
functions to perform during collections of this protocol, as well as the
base layer encapsulation identifier.

The first three octets of the identifier contain the function code and
two optional operands. The fourth octet contains the particular base
layer encapsulation used in this protocol (fig. 2).

7.1.1.1.  Function 0: None

If the function ID field (1st octet) is equal to zero, the 'op1' and
'op2' fields (2nd and 3rd octets) must also be equal to zero. This
special value indicates that no functions are applied to the protocol
identifier encoded in the remaining octets. The identifier represents a
normal protocol encapsulation.

7.1.1.2.  Function 1: Protocol Wildcard Function

The wildcard function (function-ID = 1), is used to aggregate counters,
by using a single protocol value to indicate potentially many base layer
encapsulations of a particular network layer protocol. A
protocolDirEntry of this type will match any base-layer encapsulation of
the same network layer protocol.

The 'op1' field (2nd octet) is not used and MUST be set to zero.

The 'op2' field (3rd octet) is not used and MUST be set to zero.

Each wildcard protocol identifier MUST be defined in terms of a 'base
encapsulation'. This SHOULD be as 'standard' as possible for
interoperability purposes. The lowest possible base layer value SHOULD
be chosen.  So, if an encapsulation over 'ether2' is permitted, than
this should be used as the base encapsulation.

If not then an encapsulation over LLC should be used, if permitted.  And
so on for each of the defined base layers.  It should be noted that an
agent does not have to support the non-wildcard protocol identifier over
the same base layer.  For instance a token ring only device would not
normally support IP over the ether2 base layer.  Nevertheless it should
use the ether2 base layer for defining the wildcard IP encapsulation.
The agent MAY also support counting some or all of the individual
encapsulations for the same protocols, in addition to wildcard counting.
Note that the RMON-2 MIB [RFC2021] does not require that agents maintain
counters for multiple encapsulations of the same protocol.  It is an
implementation-specific matter as to how an agent determines which
protocol combinations to allow in the protocolDirTable at any given
time.


7.2.  Base Layer Protocol Identifiers

The base layer is mandatory, and defines the base encapsulation of the
packet and any special functions for this identifier.

There are no suggested protocolDirParameters bits for the base layer.

The suggested value for the ProtocolDirDescr field for the base layer is
given by the corresponding "Name" field in the table 4.2 below. However,
implementations are only required to use the appropriate integer
identifier values.

For most base layer protocols, the protocolDirType field should contain
bits set for  the 'hasChildren(0)' and 'addressRecognitionCapable(1)'
attributes.  However, the special 'ianaAssigned' base layer should have
no parameter or attribute bits set.

By design, only 255 different base layer encapsulations are supported.
There are five base encapsulation values defined at this time. Very few
new base encapsulations (e.g. for new media types) are expected to be
added over time.

       "This branch contains protocols which do not conform easily to

       branches.  Usually, such a protocol 'almost' conforms to a
       particular 'well-known' identifier format, but additional

       identification difficult or impossible by examination of
       appropriate network traffic (preventing the any 'well-known'
       protocol-identifier macro from being used).

       Sometimes well-known protocols are simply remapped to a different
       port number by one or more venders (e.g. SNMP). These protocols
       can be identified with the 'limited extensibility' feature of the

       A centrally located list of these enumerated protocols must be

       cannot possibly be represented in a better way will be considered

7.3.  Encapsulation Layers

Encapsulation layers are positioned between the base layer and the
network layer.  It is an implementation-specific matter whether a probe
exposes all such encapsulations in its RMON-2 Protocol Directory.

7.3.1.  IEEE 802.1Q

RMON probes may encounter 'VLAN tagged' frames on monitored links.  The
IEEE Virtual LAN (VLAN) encapsulation standards [IEEE802.1Q] and
[IEEE802.1D-1998], define an encapsulation layer inserted after the MAC
layer and before the network layer.  This section  defines a PI macro
which supports most (but not all) features of that encapsulation layer.

Most notably, the RMON PI macro '802-1Q' does not expose the Token Ring
Encapsulation (TR-encaps) bit in the TCI portion of the VLAN header.  It
is an implementation specific matter whether an RMON probe converts
LLC-Token Ring (LLC-TR) formatted frames to LLC-Native (LLC-N) format,
for the purpose of RMON collection.

In order to support the Ethernet and LLC-N formats in the most efficient
manner, and still maintain alignment with the RMON-2 'collapsed' base
layer approach (i.e., support for snap and vsnap), the children of
802dot1Q are encoded a little differently than the children of other
base layer identifiers.

       component for 802.1Q, followed by [ 2.0.0.a ] where 'a' is the
       SAP value which maps to the child protocol.  For example, a
       protocolDirID-fragment value of:
          0.0.0.1.0.0.129.0.2.0.0.240

       defines NetBios, VLAN-encapsulated over LLC.

       Children are named as '802-1Q' followed by the SAP value in
       hexadecimal, with the leading octet set to the value 2.

       So the above example would have been named:
          '802-1Q 0x020000f0'

       Base ID == 4
       ------------
       For payloads encoded with  LLC/SNAP (non-zero OUI) headers
       following the VLAN header, children of this protocol are
       identified exactly as described for the 'vsnap' base layer.

       Children are encoded as [ 0.0.129.0 ], the protocol identifier
       for '802-1Q', followed by [ 4.a.b.c ] where 'a', 'b' and 'c' are
       the 3 octets of the OUI field in network byte order.

       For example, a protocolDirID-fragment value of:
         0.0.0.1.0.0.129.0.4.8.0.7 defines the Apple-specific set of
       protocols, VLAN-encapsulated over vsnap.

       Children are named as '802-1Q' followed by the <OUI> value, which
       is represented as 3 octets in hexadecimal notation, with a
       leading octet set to the value 4.

       So the above example would be named:
         '802-1Q 0x04080007'.

       Base ID == 5
       ------------
       For payloads which can only be identified as 'ianaAssigned'
       protocols, children of this protocol are identified exactly as
       described for the 'ianaAssigned' base layer.

       Children are encoded as [ 0.0.129.0 ], the protocol identifier
       for '802-1Q', followed by [ 5.0.a.b ] where 'a' and 'b' are the
       network byte order encodings of the high order byte and low order
       byte of the enumeration value for the particular IANA assigned
       protocol.

       For example, a protocolDirID-fragment value of:
          0.0.0.1.0.0.129.0.5.0.0.0.1

       defines the IPX protocol, VLAN-encapsulated directly in 802.3

       Children are named '802-1Q' followed by the numeric value of the
       particular IANA assigned protocol, with a leading octet set to
       the value of 5.

       Children are named '802-1Q' followed by the hexadecimal encoding
       of the child identifier.  The above example would be named:

          '802-1Q 0x05000001'.  "
