Abstract 
    
   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) 
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. 
   In particular, it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP-
   based management of CableHome compliant WAN Gateway Devices and home 
   routers.  Specifically, this MIB defines managed objects for both a

   connection speed tool and an ICMP "ping" tool between the Gateway and 
   devices on the LAN. 
 
   This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the 
   SNMP SMIv2 [5][6][7].  The set of objects is consistent with the SNMP 
   framework and existing SNMP standards.

1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework 
    
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current 
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of 
   RFC 3410 [12]. 
 
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally 
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).  
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the 
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB 
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, 
   RFC 2578 [7], STD 58, RFC 2579 [8] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [9].

2. Glossary 
    
   The terms in this document are derived either from normal cable 
   system usage, from normal residential gateway operation, or from the 
   documents associated with the CableHome Specifications [21]. 
       
2.1 CableHome Residential Gateway 
    
   A CableHome Residential gateway passes data traffic between the cable 
   operator's broadband data network (the Wide Area Network, WAN) and 
   the Local Area Network (LAN) in the cable data service subscriber's 
   residence or business. In addition to passing traffic between the WAN 
   and LAN, the CableHome Residential Gateway provides several services 
   including a DHCP client and a DHCP server (RFC2131) [22], a TFTP 
   server (RFC1350) [23], management services as enabled by 
   SNMPv1/v2c/v3 agent compliant with the RFCs listed in Section 1, and 
   security services including stateful packet inspection firewall 
   functionality and software code image verification using techniques. 
            
2.2 Portal Services 
    
   A logical element aggregating the set of CableHome-specified 
   functionality in a CableHome compliant cable gateway device. 
    
    
2.3 LAN IP Device  
        
   A LAN IP Device is representative of a typical IP device expected to 
   reside on home networks, and is assumed to contain a TCP/IP stack as 
   well as a DHCP client. 
    
2.4 WAN Management (WAN-Man) Address  
        
   WAN Management Addresses are intended for network management traffic 
   on the cable network between the network management system and the PS 
   element. Typically, these addresses will reside in private IP address 
   space.  
        
2.5 WAN Data (WAN-Data) Address  
        
   WAN Data Addresses are intended for subscriber application traffic on 
   the cable network and beyond, such as traffic between LAN IP Devices 
   and Internet hosts. Typically, these addresses will reside in public 
   IP address space.  
        
2.6 LAN Translated (LAN-Trans) Address

Internet-Draft       CableHome Gateway Tools MIB           March 2003 
 
   LAN Translated Addresses are intended for subscriber application and 
   management traffic on the home network between LAN IP Devices and the 
   PS element. Typically, these addresses will reside in private IP 
   address space, and can typically be reused across subscribers. 
    
2.7 LAN Passthrough (LAN-Pass) Address  
     
   LAN Passthrough Addresses are intended for subscriber application 
   traffic, such as traffic between LAN IP Devices and Internet hosts, 
   on the home network, the cable network, and beyond. Typically, these 
   addresses will reside in public IP address space. 
    
    
3. Overview 
 
   This MIB provides a set of security objects required for the 
   management of CableHome compliant residential gateway devices.  The 
   specification is derived from the CableHome 1.0 specification [21]. 
    
3.1 Structure of the MIB 
    
   This MIB is structured into two groups: 
    
   The cabhCtpConnSpeed group contains objects needed to test the 
   connection speed between the Gateway and a LAN device. 
    
   The cabhCtpPing Group provides objects allowing the manager to send 
   an ICMP ping from the Gateway to a LAN device.

7. Security Considerations 
    
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that 
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such 
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
   network operations. 
    
   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and 
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending 
   them over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide 
   features for such a secure environment. 
    
   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.  
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), 
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is 
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects 
   in this MIB module. 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as 
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), 
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for 
   authentication and privacy). 
    
   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
   RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
   instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access to 
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate 
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
