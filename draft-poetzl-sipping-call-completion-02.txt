 1.     Overview 
     
    The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) 
    Telecommunications and Internet converged Services and Protocols 
    for Advanced Networking (TISPAN) is defining the release 2 of the 
    TISPAN Next Generation Network (NGN) aiming at the creation of a 
    multimedia fixed network.  Generally NGN is based on the 3rd 
    Generation mobile Partnership Project (3GPP) IP Multimedia 
    Subsystem (IMS) Release 7 with additions required to support the 
    fixed access. 
     
    While ETSI is committed to the creation of new multimedia 
    applications and services, the importance of providing support to 
    existing Integrated Services Digital Network and Public Switched 
    Telephone Network (ISDN/PSTN) supplementary services has also been 
    acknowledged.  
     
    This document describes SIP extensions needed for the realization 
    of the Completion of Calls to Busy Subscribers (CCBS) and 
    Completion of Calls on No Reply (CCNR) service. 
     
    All mentioned 3GPP and ETSI Standards are free available under  
       http://pda.etsi.org/pda/queryform.asp   and  
       http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info. 
     
 2.     Introduction 
     
    The Completion of Calls to Busy Subscriber (CCBS) and the 
    Completion of Calls on no Reply (CCNR) services are very similar in 
    nature, thus we describe requirements and solutions for both 
    services at the same time. 
     
    Completion of Calls to Busy Subscriber (CCBS) provides the caller 
    with the ability to complete a requested call to a busy callee 
    without having to make a new call attempt when the callee becomes 
    not busy.  The CCBS service description is defined in ETSI EN 300 
    357 [5]. 
     
    Completion of Calls on no Reply (CCNR) provides the caller with the 
    ability to complete a requested call to a callee without having to 
    make a new call attempt when the callee becomes not busy after 
    having initiated an activity.  The CCNR service description is 
    defined in ETSI EN 301 134 [6]. 
     
    The call completion services provide the capability to queue 
    several CCBS/CCNR requests to the same callee on a FIFO basis. It 
    therefore requires functionalities like notifying changes of queue 
    states and managing queues. 
     
    The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event framework is described 
    in RFC 3265 [2].  It defines a generic framework for subscription 
  
 Poetzl                 Expires August 15, 2007                 Page 4 
 Internet-Draft             Call Completion              February 2007 

    to, and notification of, events related to SIP systems.  The 
    framework defines the methods SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY, and introduces 
    the notion of a package.  A package is a concrete application of 
    the event framework to a particular class of events. 
     
    This document defines a SIP event package that enables subscribing 
    to and managing call completion queues. Furthermore it specifies 
    the usage of the Allow-events header field in 486 Busy responses 
    for the realization of a Completion of Calls to Busy Subscribers 
    (CCBS) service and the usage of the Allow-events header field in 
    180 Ringing responses for the realization of a Completion of Calls 
    on No Reply (CCNR) service, as well as an indication to prioritize 
    call-completion calls. 
     
     
 3.     Definitions 
     
    For the purpose of this service, we provide the following 
    definitions (sources: ETSI EN 300 357 [5], ETSI EN 301 134 [6], 
    ETSI EN 300 356-18 [7] and EN 300 356-20 [8]): 
     
    CCBS:  Completion of Calls to Busy Subscribers 
     
    CCNR:  Completion of Calls on No Reply 
     
    Call-completion request:  an instance of an activation of the call-
    completion service which is held in a queue pending the correct 
    conditions for the call-completion service to be completed. 
     
    Suspended call-completion request:  a call-completion request which 
    cannot be served even if the callee is in the appropriate state 
    because the caller is busy. 
     
    CCBS/CCNR service duration timer:  maximum time the CCBS/CCNR 
    request will remain activated for the caller within the network. 
     
    Call-completion call:  a call from the call-completion user to the 
    call-completion target, triggered as a result of the execution of a 
    call completion service. 
     
    CCSS indication:  an indication that a call is a call-completion 
    call. 
     
    Retain option:  an optional capability of the originating and 
    destination networks whereby they cooperate in maintaining the 
    call-completion request in the queue if a call-completion call has 
    failed due to destination busy. 
     
    A queue:  a buffer at the originating network for the control of 
    call-completion requests associated with user A.

 Internet-Draft             Call Completion              February 2007 

    B queue:  a buffer at the destination network for the control of 
    call-completion requests associated with the destination user B. 
    The buffer is used to support the monitoring of user B to become 
    not busy. 
     
 4.     Requirements motivating SIP extensions in support of call 
    completion services 
     
    This section collects the CCBS/CCNR services requirements that 
    cannot be fulfilled with existing SIP capabilities. 
     
 4.1      Queue monitoring and management capability 
     
    The CCBS and CCNR services require the capability to to manage and 
    monitor call completion queues . A call-completion queue is a queue 
    of call-completion requests against a single callee and is 
    generally managed in a FIFO manner, except for requests that have 
    been suspended (see below). A call-completion request that reaches 
    the front of the queue will be allowed to mature (resulting in an 
    attempt to establish a call-completion call) when the callee is 
    available. 
     
    Managing a call-completion queue involves the following actions: 
     
    - adding a call-completion request to the back of a call-completion 
    queue; 
    - suspending an existing call-completion request; 
    - resuming a suspended call-completion request; 
    - cancelling a call-completion request (removing it from the 
    queue). 
     
    Adding a call-completion request to a call-completion queue 
    normally occurs after call establishment has failed due to busy 
    (CCBS) or nor reply (CCNR). 
     
    Suspending a call-completion request occurs when the caller is not 
    available for making a call-completion call (i.e., the caller is 
    busy) but wishes to retain the call-completion request in 
    anticipation of making the call-completion call later. 
     
    Resuming a call-completion request occurs when the condition that 
    led to suspension has been removed (i.e., the caller is free 
    again). 
     
    Cancelling a call-completion request can occur for reasons such as 
    cancellation by the user or expiry of the CCBS/CCNR service 
    duration timer. It can also occur when the call-back request is 
    completed successfully. 
     
    Monitoring a call completion queue involves monitoring a particular 
    call-completion request to determine when the callee is available 
  
 Poetzl                 Expires August 15, 2007                 Page 6 
 Internet-Draft             Call Completion              February 2007 

    for the call-completion call to be attempted. In the CCBS case this 
    is on transition from a busy condition to a non-busy condition.  In 
    the CCNR case this is when the callee has initiated and optionally, 
    if the initiation was successfull, released a new call with a third 
    user.  Monitoring is required to start when a call-completion 
    request is added to the queue and to cease when that request is 
    cancelled or completed successfully. 
     
    Furthermore notifications of changes in the status of call 
    completion queues are needed, when the call completion service 
    towards a target user meets the call completion service condition. 
     
 4.2      CCBS/CCNR subscription capability indication 
     
    In order to assure that end-to-end functionality of the CCBS and 
    CCNR services is possible, there must be an indication in the 
    backward direction during attempted call establishment that the 
    CCBS/CCNR service is possible and can be used to advise the caller 
    that CCBS or CCNR is available. 
        
 4.3      Prioritization of call-completion calls 
     
    Calls triggered as a result of the execution of a call completion 
    service (call-completion calls) MUST be distinguishable from new 
    incoming calls.  This permits rejection of new incoming calls when 
    there are outstanding call-completion requests in the queue, whilst 
    admitting call-completion calls from sources that have been 
    notified that the callee is available. The call-completion call 
    indication is also required for the interworking with the PSTN, 
    where a specific ‘CCSS indication’ is required for CCBS/CCNR calls. 
     
     
 5.     Overview of the solution 
     
    This document defines in section 6 a new event package (call-
    completion event package) in support of queue management and 
    monitoring. An agent acting on behalf of the caller acts as 
    subscriber and an agent acting on behalf of the call-completion 
    queue at the callee acts as notifier. 
     
    Subscription to the event package using the SIP SUBSCRIBE method 
    initiates monitoring and of a call-completion request that is 
    placed in the callee's call-completion queue at the same time. Thus 
    the subscribe request includes details of the call-completion 
    request to be added, including whether it is for CCBS or CCNR. 
    Having subscribed successfully, relevant changes in queue state 
    that impact the call-completion request associated with the 
    subscription are reported to the subscriber by means of the SIP 
    NOTIFY requests. A NOTIFY request that reports that the callee is 
    available for a call-completion call attempt to be made will cause 

  
 Poetzl                 Expires August 15, 2007                 Page 7 
 Internet-Draft             Call Completion              February 2007 

    the subscriber to trigger the establishment of that call, subject 
    to the caller being available too. 
     
    The SUBSCRIBE method is also used to cancel the subscription and 
    thereby cancel the call-completion request. Cancellation can also 
    be initiated by the notifier, in which case a NOTIFY request will 
    indicate that the susbscription has been cancelled. Suspension and 
    resumption of a request are achieved by performing a subscription 
    refresh in which the SUBSCRIBE request carries the instruction to 
    suspend or resume. 
     
    The possibility to activate CCBS is indicated by including the 
    Allow-Events Header field (Allow-Events:call-completion) in a 486 
    Busy response. 
     
    The possibility to activate CCNR is indicated by including the 
    Allow-Events Header field (Allow-Events:call-completion) in a 180 
    Ringing response. 
     
    This enables the recipient of the 180 or 486 messages to identify 
    that the remote server is capable of receiving a subscription for 
    call-completion event associated with the INVITE transaction. 
     
       Although RFC 3265 section 3.3.7 indicates that a node 
       implementing an event package should indicate this in all 
       methods which initiate dialogs and their responses, this 
       document recommends restricting the indication to particular 
       responses in order to only match the call-completion possible 
       situations on the destination side. 
     
    In order to prioritize a call-completion call, this document 
    defines a new header field, the P-Service-Indication header field, 
    described in section 8. 
     
 6.     Call Completion event package 
     
    This section fills in the details needed to specify an event 
    package as defined in Section 4.4 of RFC 3265 [2]. 
     
 6.1      Event Package Name 
     
    The SIP Events specification requires package definitions to 
    specify the name of their package or template-package. 
     
    The name of this package is "call-completion".  As specified in RFC 
    3265 [2], this value appears in the Event and Allow-events header 
    fields. 
     
 6.2      Event Package Parameters 
     

  
 Poetzl                 Expires August 15, 2007                 Page 8 
 Internet-Draft             Call Completion              February 2007 

    No package specific Event header parameters are defined for this 
    event package. 
     
 6.3      SUBSCRIBE Bodies 
     
    RFC 3265 [2] requires package definitions to define the usage, if 
    any, of bodies in SUBSCRIBE requests. 
    A SUBSCRIBE for call completion events MUST contain a body that 
    describes the call-completion operations described in section 5.  
    This body is formatted in the "application/call-completion" data 
    format described in section 7. 
     
    In this event package, the body of the subscription contains a 
    call-completion document.  All subscribers and notifiers MUST 
    support the "application/call-completion" data format described in 
    section 7.  The SUBSCRIBE request MAY contain an Accept header 
    field.  If no such header field is present, it has a default value 
    of "application/call-completion".  If the header field is present, 
    it MUST include "application/call-completion". 
     
 6.4      Subscription Duration 
     
    RFC 3265 [2] requires package definitions to define a default value 
    for subscription durations, and to discuss reasonable choices for 
    durations when they are explicitly specified. 
    It is recommended to set the default duration of subscriptions to 
    call completion events to a value higher than 3600 seconds which 
    corresponds to the highest timer value recommended for the call 
    completion services in ETSI and ITU-T. 
     
 6.5      NOTIFY Bodies 
     
    RFC 3265 [2] requires package definitions to describe the allowed 
    set if body types in NOTIFY requests, and to specify the default 
    value to be used when there is no Accept header field in the 
    SUBSCRIBE request  
    A NOTIFY for call completion events MUST contain a body that 
    describes the call-completion operations described in section 5. 
     
    As described in RFC 3265 [2], the NOTIFY message will contain 
    bodies that describe the state of the subscribed resource.  This 
    body is in a format listed in the Accept header field of the 
    SUBSCRIBE, or in a package-specific default format if the Accept 
    header field was omitted from the SUBSCRIBE. 
     
    In this event package, the body of the notification contains a 
    call-completion document.  All subscribers and notifiers MUST 
    support the "application/call-completion" data format described in 
    section 7.  The SUBSCRIBE request MAY contain an Accept header 
    field.  If no such header field is present, it has a default value 
    of "application/call-completion".  If the header field is present, 
  
 Poetzl                 Expires August 15, 2007                 Page 9 
 Internet-Draft             Call Completion              February 2007 

    it MUST include "application/call-completion". This 
    "application/call-completion" data format is described in chapter 
    6. 
     
    Of course, the notifications generated by the server MUST be in one 
    of the formats specified in the Accept header field in the 
    SUBSCRIBE request. 
     
 6.6      Subscriber Generation of SUBSCRIBE requests 
     
    Subscribers MUST generate SUBSCRIBE requests when a call completion 
    service condition occurs at the originating side that needs to be 
    sent towards the terminating side.  This includes the following 
    CCBS operations:  call completion request, call completion suspend, 
    call completion resume, and any of the call completion cancellation 
    operations described in section 5. The generation of SUBSCRIBE 
    requests MAY imply the usage of call completion service specific 
    timers. An example of such an implementation can be found in ETSI 
    TS 183 042 [9]. 
     
 6.7      Notifier Processing of SUBSCRIBE Requests 
     
    Upon receiving a subscription refresh, the notifier MUST set the 
    “expires” parameter of the Subscription-State header to the current 
    remaining duration of the subscription regardless of the value 
    received in the Expires header (if present) of the subscription 
    refresh. 
    The call completion information can be sensitive.  Therefore, all 
    subscriptions SHOULD be authenticated and then authorized before 
    approval.  The call completion event package specified in this 
    document is intended to be used in private domains (e.g. IMS) where 
    authentication and authorization are provided via means out of 
    scope of this document. 
     
 6.8      Notifier Generation of NOTIFY Requests 
     
    Notifiers MUST generate NOTIFY requests when a call completion 
    service condition occurs at the terminating side that needs to be 
    sent towards the originating side. 
     
    A NOTIFY sent as a confirmation of the initial subscription or of a 
    subscription refresh MUST contain the "queue-state" parameter set 
    to "request-queued" if the user is busy and the call completion 
    action was successful (i.e. call completion request, call 
    completion suspend, or call completion resume) and to "user-free-
    for-recall" if the call completion target is not busy. 
     
    A NOTIFY sent as a confirmation of a request to unsubscribe MUST 
    NOT contain the "queue-state" parameter since the user has not 
    longer any queue state.

    When the call completion target status changes from busy to not 
    busy, the notifier MUST send a NOTIFY only to first non-suspended 
    user in the queue.  This NOTIFY MUST contains the "queue-state" 
    parameter set to "user-free-for-recall". 
     
    If the call completion queuing was denied by the terminating 
    network, the NOTIFY sent as a confirmation of the subscription MUST 
    contain the "denial-reason" parameter. 
     
 6.9      Subscriber Processing of NOTIFY Requests 
     
    The subscriber processing of NOTIFY requests MAY trigger additional 
    CCBS service procedures (e.g. CCBS recall, usage of CCBS timers?).  
    An example of such procedures can be found in ETSI TS 183 042 [9]. 
     
 6.10       Handling of Forked Requests 
     
    The SIP Events framework mandates that packages indicate whether or 
    not forked SUBSCRIBE requests can install multiple subscriptions.  
    Forked requests are NOT ALLOWED for the call completion event type.  
     
 6.11       Rate of Notifications 
     
    RFC 3265 [2] mandates that packages define a maximum rate of 
    notifications for their package. 
     
    The call completion service typically involves a single 
    notification per notifier and per subscription but MAY involve 
    several notifications separated by a call completion call that 
    failed due to a busy call completion target. 
     
 6.12       State Agents 
     
    RFC 3265 [2] asks packages to consider the role of state agents in 
    their design.  State agents have no role in the handling of the 
    call completion package. 
     
 6.13       Handling of the Allow-Events Header 
     
    The Call Completion event package introduces a new Allow-Events 
    header type (Allow-Events:call-completion) to indicate the 
    possibility to activate CCBS or CCNR in a 486 Busy response or 180 
    Ringing response respectively.

 7.     Call-completion information format 
     
    The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur 
    Form (ABNF) as described in RFC 2234. The formal syntax for the 
    application/call-completion MIME type is described below. 
     
    call-completion = [queue-nature CLRF]  
       [queue-operation CLRF][queue-state CLRF][caller CLRF] 
       [service-retention CLRF][cancellation-reason CLRF] 
     
    A description of the above mentioned rules follows. 
     
 7.1      queue-nature 
     
    The queue-nature indicates the nature of the call completion event 
    and may be present in SUBSRIBE and NOTIFY requests.  
     
       queue-nature  =  "queue-nature" HCOLON ( "CCBS" / "CCNR" ) 
     
    It is possible that further values are needed in future, they can 
    be defined by the RFCs which extend the present functionality. 
     
 7.1.1 CCBS 
     
    The CCBS class states it is a request for a CCBS queue. 
     
 7.1.2 CCNR 
     
    The CCNR class states it is a request for a CCNR queue. 
     
 7.2      queue-operation 
     
    The queue-operation class indicates the requested action and is 
    present in SUBSCRIBE requests.  
     
    queue-operation  =  "queue-operation" HCOLON ( "add" /  
                         "suspend" / "resume" )

 Internet-Draft             Call Completion              February 2007 

 7.2.1 add 
     
    The add class states that the subscription must be added in the 
    queue.  This value can only be present in initial SUBSCRIBE 
    requests. 
     
 7.2.2 suspend 
     
    The suspend class states that the subscription must be suspended, 
    but not removed from its position in the queue.  This value can 
    only be present in SUBSCRIBE requests refreshing a subscription. 
     
 7.2.3 resume 
     
    The resume class states that a previously suspended subscription 
    must be resumed.  This value can only be present in SUBSCRIBE 
    requests refreshing a subscription. 
     
 7.3      queue-state 
     
    The queue-state indicates the status of the request in the queue 
    and is present in NOTIFY requests.  
     
    queue-state  =  "queue-state" HCOLON ( "request-queued" /  
                      "user-free-for-recall" ) 
     
 7.3.1 request-queued 
     
    The request-queued indicates the call-completion queue request was 
    accepted and is active. 
     
 7.3.2 user-free-for-recall 
     
    The user-free-for-recall indicates the call-completion condition. 
     
 7.4      caller 
     
    The caller uniquely identifies the user that has originated the 
    call completion request and MUST be present in any initial 
    SUBSCRIBE request. 
     
    caller  =  "caller" HCOLON addr-spec 
     
 7.5      service-retention 
     
    The service-retention indicates the support of the retain option.  
    The retain option, if supported on both the originating and 
    terminating side, will maintain the call completion request in the 
    destination B queue, if a call completion call has failed due to 
    destination busy condition.  If present, this parameter indicates

 Internet-Draft             Call Completion              February 2007 

    that the retain option is supported, otherwise it is not supported.  
    This parameter MAY be present in SUBSCRIBE and/or NOTIFY requests. 
        
    service-retention  =  "service-retention" 
     
 7.6      cancellation-reason 
     
    The cancellation-reason MAY be present if the Expires Header field 
    is valued to 0 and MUST NOT be present otherwise.  It details the 
    reason why the call completion subscription is being cancelled. 
     
       cancellation-reason  =  "cancellation-reason" HCOLON ( 
    "operation-timeout" / "service-duration" / "recall-timeout" /  
    "service-completed" ) 
     
 7.6.1 operation-timeout 
     
    The operation-timeout corresponds to the expiry of the timer 
    supervising the response to a call completion request sent from the 
    originating side to the terminating side (i.e. the initial NOTIFY).  
    Note that this reason value corresponds to the expiry of CCBS-T2 
    timer in the PSTN/ISDN if present in a SUBSCRIBE request as 
    described in [7]. 
     
 7.6.2 service-duration 
     
    The service-duration corresponds to the expiry of the timer that 
    specifies the maximum time the call completion request will remain 
    activated.  Note that this reason value corresponds to CCBS-T3 
    expiry in the PSTN/ISDN if present in a SUBSCRIBE request, to CCBS-
    T7 expiry in the PSTN/ISDN if present in a NOTIFY request as 
    described in [7]. 
     
 7.6.3 recall-timeout 
     
    The recall-timeout corresponds to the expiry of the timer that 
    specifies the maximum time the originating side will wait for a 
    response from user A to a ‘user-free-for-recall’ indication (call 
    completion recall).  Note that this reason value corresponds to 
    CCBS-T4 expiry in the PSTN/ISDN if present in a SUBSCRIBE request, 
    to CCBS-T9 expiry in the PSTN/ISDN if present in a NOTIFY request 
    as described in [7]. 
     
 7.6.4 service-completed 
     
    The service-completed indicates that the call completion service is 
    completed.  This value MAY be present in a NOTIFY message and MUST 
    NOT be present in a SUBSCRIBE message.

 Internet-Draft             Call Completion              February 2007 

 7.7      denial-reason 
     
    The denial-reason details the reason why the call completion 
    request has been denied. 
     
    denial-reason  =  "denial-reason" HCOLON ( "short-term-denial" /  
    "long-term-denial" ) 
     
 7.7.1 short-term-denial 
     
    The short-term-denial indicates that the terminating side 
    temporarily cannot accept a call completion request from the 
    originating side.  A later attempt from the originating side to 
    subscribe to a call completion queue on the terminating side may 
    succeed. This reason will be given e.g. if there are already the 
    maximum number of call completion requests queued against the 
    terminating side, if there is an interaction with another event 
    which temporarily prevents the subscription to the call completion 
    queue, or if no compatible terminal is found at the terminating 
    side. 
    This value MAY be present in a NOTIFY message and MUST NOT be 
    present in a SUBSCRIBE message. 
     
 7.7.2 long-term-denial 
     
    The long-term-denial indicates that the terminating side cannot 
    accept a call completion request from the originating side and a 
    later attempt from the originating side to subscribe to a call 
    completion queue on the terminating side will also be rejected. 
    This value MAY be present in a NOTIFY message and MUST NOT be 
    present in a SUBSCRIBE message. 
     
    The request-URI specifies the user whose data is being subscribed 
    to. 
     
     
 8.     The P-Service-Indication Header 
     
    The P-Service-Indication header is meant to be used in certain 
    deployment scenarios where there is a need for SIP elements to 
    request each other to apply a special processing of a SIP request 
    or response.  The P-Service-Indication Header does not strictly 
    mandate a special handling by SIP elements, it suggests it. 
    In case no element in the path supports this header semantic, the 
    message processing is not affected.  In particular, a SIP element 
    can not reject a request if it contains the P-Service-Indication 
    with an indication that it does not understand.  The header 
    semantic is a list of service indications (SI) represented by 
    tokens.  In order to prevent misuse of this header, list of 
    attribute-value pairs is not allowed.

 8.1      UAC Behavior 
     
    A caller wishing to invoke one or more special processings for a 
    request from the network which will handle an outbound transaction 
    includes one or more P-Service-Indication header fields in the 
    request.  No additional behavior is required after the request is 
    sent.  The P-Service-Indication header fields in an ACK for a non-
    2xx final response and in a CANCEL request MUST NOT contain any P-
    Service-Indication Header fields.  This does not apply to ACK 
    requests for 2xx final responses. 
    An UAC receiving a response message MAY behave differently 
    depending on the list of service indications received in it. 
    In the case of a CCBS/CCNR call, the UAC shall insert a P-Service-
    indication header field with the value ‘ccss’ in the INVITE request  
     
 8.2      UAS Behavior 
     
    An UAS receiving a request message MAY inspect the P-Service-
    Indication headers contained therein, in order to apply a special 
    (service-specific) processing for that request. When generating a 
    response, it MAY include one or more P-Service-Indication header 
    fields containing a list of service indications the UAS wishes to 
    communicate to intermediate elements upstream.  There is no 
    relationship between the list of service indications received in 
    the request and the ones generated in the response.  In particular, 
    a response MAY contain a list of service indications also if the 
    original request did not contain any P-Service-Indication header 
    fields, and vice versa. 
    In the case of CCBS/CCNR, on the receipt of an INVITE request with 
    a P-Service-indication header field with the value ‘ccss’, this 
    INVITE shall have priority about new incoming requests without such 
    an indication. 
     
 8.3      Proxy Behavior 
     
    When receiving a SIP request or response containing a list of P-
    Service-Indication header fields, a Proxy MAY ignore them, or it 
    MAY iterate over all of them looking for service indications that 
    can affect the message processing. SIP proxies MAY add or remove P-
    Service-Indication header fields. 
     
 8.4      Example 
     
    A call completion call, as an example, requires the entity 
    performing call completion to add a P-Service-Indication header 
    field in the INVITE request, as follows:

                    Table 1: Summary of methods  
     
 8.6      Augmented BNF 
     
    The BNF for the P-Service-Indication header field is:  
     
    P-Service-Indication  =  "P-Service-Indication" HCOLON service-
    request * (COMMA service-request) 
    service-request=  "ccss" / token 
     
    The "ccss" parameter provides the indication of a CCBS/CCNR call.  
    Additional tokens can be registered using IANA and the procedures 
    in section 11.

    Figure 1: Call completion on busy subscriber signaling flow 
     
     
    Figure 1 shows an example for a basic call completion on busy 
    subscriber signaling flow. In this example Alice wants to call 
    Carol, but Carol is already in a call and answers with a 486 Busy 
    response. In order to indicate to Alice that call completion is

    possible, she inserts ‘Allow-events: call-completion’ into the 
    response. 
    Alice activates call completion by subscribing to the call-
    completion event package at Carol and adding herself to the call-
    completion queue. 
    Bob also encounters the busy status when he calls Carol, so he 
    activates to call completion, too. 
    Then Carol hangs up, and Alice is informed of the call-completion 
    condition and she initiates the call-completion call to Carol, 
    using the P-Service-Indication header field (P-service-
    Indication:ccss).

    If Bob wants to suspend his call completion activation for a 
    certain time (because e.g. he is busy), but he doesn’t want to lose 
    his place in the call completion queue, he refreshes his 
    subscription to the call-completion queue, suspending his call-
    completion request. 
    When Bob wants to resume the call-completion activation, he 
    refreshes his subscription to call-completion queue again, resuming 
    his call-completion request.  
    The suspend/resume procedures are shown in figure 2. Note that in 
    Carol’s responses the Expires-header field is set to the current 
    remaining duration of the subscription regardless of the value 
    received in the Expires header field of Bob’s subscription 
    refreshes.

 10.      Security Considerations 
     
 10.1       Call Completion event package 
     
    Security considerations for SIP event packages are discussed in RFC 
    3265 [2], and those considerations apply here.  Call Completion 
    information is sensitive, potentially private, information.  
    Subscriptions to these event packages SHOULD be authenticated and 
    authorized according to local policy.  In addition, notifications 
    SHOULD be sent in such a way to ensure confidentiality, message 
    integrity and verification of subscriber identity, such as sending 
    subscriptions and notifications using a SIPS URL or protecting the 
    notification bodies with S/MIME. 
     
 10.2       P-Service-Indication header 
     
    Every RFC documenting an extension of the P-Service-Indication 
    Header tag, MUST consider security issues independently.  Since the 
    "ccss" tag on a request can be abused to obtain privileged 
    treatment, request containing the "ccss" tag SHOULD be 
    authenticated and authorized according to local policy.  When 
    crossing trust boundaries, SIP proxies MAY add or remove P-Service-
    Indication header fields containing the "ccss" tag. 
     
 11.      IANA Considerations 
     
 11.1       SIP Event Package Registration 
     
    Package name: call-completion  
    Type: package  
     
    Contact: Ultan Mulligan, <ultan.mulligan@etsi.org>  
    Change Controller: SIPPING Working Group delegated from the IESG  
    Published Specification: RFCXXXX 
     
 11.2       P-Service-Indication Header Registration 
     
    This specification registers a new SIP header field, according to 
    the process of RFC 3261 [1]. 
     
    The following is the registration for the P-Service-Indication 
    header field: 
     
    RFC Number: RFC XXXX [Note to IANA: Fill with the RFC number of 
    this specification]. 
     
    Header Field Name: P-Service-Indication  
     
    Compact Form: (none)

 11.3       IANA P-Service-Indication Tags Registration  
     
    A new registry ("P-Service-Indication Tags") in the sip-parameters 
    section of IANA has been created, taking a form similar to this 
    table below: 
     
    Service-Indication Tag  Description                  Reference

                                  this service indication  
     
    Reference                     Reference to RFC documenting usage 
                                  and scope of this service indication
