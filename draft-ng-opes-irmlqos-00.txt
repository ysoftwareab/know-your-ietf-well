1. Introduction 
    
   The Intermediary Rule Markup Language (IRML) [2] is an XML-based 
   language that can be used to describe service-specific execution 
   rules for network edge intermediaries under the Open Pluggable Edge 
   Services (OPES) framework, as described in [3] and [4].  This memo 
   illustrates examples of employing the IRML for Quality of Service 
   (QoS) policing and control, and suggests extensions to IRML for 
   better QoS support.  
 
   This memo begins in Section 2 by illustrating a few scenarios where 
   QoS policing and control can be incorporated into the OPES 
   intermediary.  From there, a set of preliminary requirements for QoS 
   extension to the IRML is drafted in Section 3.  Section 4 proposed a 
   set of QoS extension to the "property" element defined in the IRML, 
   and Section 5 presents some examples illustrating possible use of 
   these extensions. 
    
1.1. Terms Used 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [5]. 
    
    
2. Example Services for QoS Policing in OPES Services 
    
2.1. Adaptation of HTML Contents 
    
   By far, Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) pages are the most common 
   content transported by the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).  
   These HTML contents are usually static, making them ideal candidate 
 
  
Ng, Tan, Cheng           Expires January 2002                  [Page 2]

   to be cached at the network edge.  However, with increasing number 
   of "thin" clients, it is virtually impossible to have a HTML page 
   that is suitable to be viewed for all the possible browsers. 
   Adaptation of HTML pages to suit the clientÆs browser is widely 
   employed (through means of server-side includes or client-side 
   JavaScripts).  One excellent example would be the adaptation of HTML 
   to WML (Wireless Markup Language) pages.  
    
   Adaptation of HTML pages can also be employed to suit the user or 
   access-provider QoS requirements.  For example, it might be 
   necessary to remove redundant information when translating HTML 
   pages to WML for a mobile phone client with a very limited bandwidth 
   (and limited screen size).  It will also be helpful to replace the 
   <IMG> tags in the original HTML page to their ALT text equivalence. 
   For another client who is using a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) 
   with a Wideband-CDMA connection, the translated WML may include more 
   of the original HTML contents and some pictures. 
    
   Bandwidth is not the only consideration.  For the example of the PDA 
   client quoted above, when the channel condition is poor, it might be 
   desirable to reduce the amount of text in the translated WML to 
   ensure a more speedy delivery. 
    
   Such HTML adaptation is not only limited to the wireless scenario. 
   For a client with a wired connection to the Internet, it is 
   sometimes necessary to sub-sample the embedded images in a HTML 
   pages to reduce their size so as to meet the maximum delay 
   requirements imposed by the user or access-provider.  This can occur 
   when the allocated bandwidth is small, or when the connection is 
   congested (e.g. the user is downloading a couple of files 
   simultaneously). 
    
2.2. Dynamic Adaptation of Streaming Contents 
    
   Streaming of audio-visual (AV) contents over the Internet has become 
   increasing popular over the years.  AV streaming poses different 
   technical challenges as compared to HTML delivery, with stricter QoS 
   requirements, such as maximum delay and constant/variable bit-rate.  
   When the transport technologies employed within the network core are 
   best-effort delivery in nature, it is very difficult to guaranteed 
   the required quality of service. Thus, to maintain the perceived QoS 
   by the user, it is often necessary to dynamically adapt the AV 
   stream to the fluctuating network connection conditions [6].  
   Ideally such adaptation services should be placed near the end-user, 
   so as to reduce the errors in estimating the network conditions at 
   the network edge. This also allows for intermediary to cache the AV 
   contents, and directing the contents to the adaptation service 
   depending on the QoS requirements and channel conditions.

   The use of OPES intermediaries to adapt the AV contents requires 
   that the QoS parameters, such as allocated/requested bandwidth and 
   channel conditions, be made available to the rule decision engine. 
    
2.3. QoS Policy Control 
    
   Often, the OPES services will reside on an intermediary box that is 
   provided by the access provider. Thus one major application of the 
   IRML is to implement policy rules based on the Service Level 
   Agreement (SLA) between the access provider and the end-user. QoS is 
   one important aspect of SLA. 
    
   To illustrate, consider the following scenario where an end-user has 
   a service policy of 64kbps bandwidth.  Suppose the end-user is in 
   the middle of watching a movie at 56kbps when a 16kbps voice-over-IP 
   (VoIP) stream arrives. Instead of simply rejecting the VoIP 
   connection, with IRML services, the access provider (or even the 
   end-user) can now specify policy rules to perform any of following 
   more desirable actions:  
    
   (a) adapts the VoIP stream to the remaining bandwidth,  
    
   (b) adapts the movie stream to give room for the VoIP stream (e.g. 
      mute the audio from the movie), or 
    
   (c) adapts both the movie and VoIP streams. 
    
2.4. Load-Balancing 
    
   The OPES framework in [3] allows for the adaptation services to be 
   performed remotely on a separate, dedicated server, such as an ICAP 
   server.  This allows for scalability. However, when the number of 
   connections is small, it might not be desirable to perform remote 
   callout, as the overhead incurred will add transmission delays. IRML 
   can be employed to redirect content adaptation to a remote server 
   when the load on the intermediary is high, and to use a local 
   proxylet when the load is low.  Such decision can only be done if 
   IRML is extended to environment properties, such as server load. 
    
   In addition to serverÆs processing load, such decision may based on 
   the end-userÆs QoS requirement as well.  For instance, when the 
   server load is moderate, it might process adaptation services for 
   end-users with stricter QoS requirements, and invoke remote 
   adaptation services for end-users with lower QoS requirements. 
    
    
3. Requirements for QoS Extension 
    
   In consideration to the example services illustrated in the previous 
   sections, a preliminary set of requirements for the QoS extension to 
   the IRML can be outlined as follow:

   -  It SHOULD enable rule modules to match the end-user QoS policy 
      requirements against pre-defined labels.  Such QoS policy 
      requirements MAY include, but not limited to, the allocated 
      bandwidth to the end-user, the requested bandwidth for the 
      current connection, and the required delay bound, if any. 
    
   -  It SHOULD enable rule modules to match the transmission 
      statistics of the end-user connection with the intermediary 
      against pre-defined labels.  
    
   -  It SHOULD enable rule modules to match the current system load of 
      the intermediary against pre-defined labels.  The system load MAY 
      be inferred from percentage load, and/or the number of 
      connections the intermediary is handling. 
    
   The above set of requirements is not exhaustive.  Further research 
   work needs to be carried out to evaluate the applicability of these 
   requirements, and append additional requirements if deem 
   appropriate. 
    
    
4. Proposal to IRML Extensions 
    
   In order to extend QoS-aware services in the OPES intermediary, it 
   is proposed that the recognized property names of the "property" 
   element in IRML be extended to include various QoS-related 
   properties.  These will be described in the following sub-sections. 
    
4.1. QoS Policy Properties 
    
   The following are the proposed QoS policy parameters to be extended 
   to the "property" element. These values are access control 
   parameters, thus the rule engine can obtain their values via an 
   interface to an access control module.  Specification of such 
   interface/module is out of scope. 
    
   Property Name            Value 
   -------------------------------------------------------------------- 
   "allocated-bandwidth"    the allocated bandwidth for the end-user 
   "requested-bandwidth"    the requested bandwidth for this connection 
   "available-bandwidth"    the amount of bandwidth available for the 
                            end-user 
   "delay-bound"            the maximum delay requested 
    
    
4.2. Network Status Properties 
    
   The following are the proposed network status parameters to be 
   extended to the "property" element. These dynamic values reflect the 
   current network link status. The rule engine can obtain these values 
   either via an interface to a traffic monitoring module, or in the

   case of RTP connections, from the RTCP sender/receiver reports [7]. 
   Specification of such interface/module is out of scope. 
    
   Property Name            Value 
   -------------------------------------------------------------------- 
   "r-octets-count"         the accumulated number of octets received 
                            by the end-user 
   "s-octets-count"         the accumulated number of octets received 
                            by the intermediary 
   "r-packets-count"        the accumulated number of packets received 
                            by the end-user 
   "s-packets-count"        the accumulated number of packets received 
                            by the intermediary 
   "r-packets-lost"         the total number of packets not received by 
                            the end-user 
   "s-packets-lost"         the total number of packets not received by 
                            the intermediary 
   "r-fraction-lost"        the fraction of packets lost reported by 
                            the end-user since the previous report 
   "s-fraction-lost"        the fraction of packets lost reported by 
                            the intermediary since the previous report 
   "r-jitter"               the inter-arrival jitter reported by the 
                            end-user 
   "s-jitter"               the inter-arrival jitter reported by the 
                            intermediary 
    
    
   Because the rule engine should be stateless, it might be necessary 
   for the module providing the values of the QoS parameters to provide 
   additional information about the difference in the parameters values 
   after a specific interval. 
    
   Property Name            Value 
   -------------------------------------------------------------------- 
   "r-octets-diff"          the difference in accumulated number of 
                            octets received by the end-user of two most 
                            recent consecutive reports 
   "s-octets-diff"          the difference in the accumulated number of 
                            octets received by the intermediary of two 
                            most recent consecutive reports 
   "r-packets-diff"         the difference in the accumulated number of 
                            packets received by the end-user of two 
                            most recent consecutive reports 
   "s-packets-diff"         the difference in the accumulated number of 
                            packets received by the intermediary of two 
                            most recent consecutive reports 
   "r-packets-lost-diff"    the difference in the total number of 
                            packets not received by the end-user of two 
                            most recent consecutive reports 
   "s-packets-lost-diff"    the difference in the total number of 
                            packets not received by the intermediary of 
                            two most recent consecutive reports

4.3. Intermediary Load Properties 
    
   The following are the proposed server load parameters to be extended 
   to the "property" element, in addition to the existing "system-time" 
   and "system-date" definitions. These values are system environment 
   parameters, thus the rule engine can obtain their values via an 
   interface to a system module.  Specification of such an interface/ 
   module is out of scope. 
    
   Property Name              Value 
   -------------------------------------------------------------------- 
   "system-processing-load"   the current processing load in percentage 
                              of the intermediary 
   "system-connections"       the current number of established end-
                              user connections  
    
    
5. Examples 
    
   The first example below illustrates the case where a HTML page is 
   adapted to suit the allocated bandwidth of the client.  Here, we 
   assume that there is a sub-system to check the allocated bandwidth 
   and classify it to a relevant tag of "low", "medium", or "high". 
    
   <rule processing-point="4"> 
      <!-- invoke local services to insert label --> 
      <action>checkBandwidth</action> 
      <!-- check the allocated bandwidth and adapts accordingly --> 
      <property name="allocated-bandwidth" matches="low"> 
         <!-- Bandwidth is low, use tiny WML  --> 
         <action>proxylet://localhost/html2wml?target=tiny</action> 
      </property> 
      <property name="allocated-bandwidth" matches="medium"> 
         <!-- Bandwidth is moderate, use small WML  --> 
         <action>proxylet://localhost/html2wml?target=small</action> 
      </property> 
      <property name="allocated-bandwidth" matches="high"> 
         <!-- Bandwidth is high, use large WML  --> 
         <action>proxylet://localhost/html2wml?target=large</action> 
      </property> 
   </rule> 
    
    
   The second example illustrates the scenario where an adaptation 
   service is carried out in locally or remotely based on the system 
   processor load.  It also illustrates the adaptations of video stream 
   based on the connection status.  This examples assumes that there is 
   sub-system to classify the system load and receiver fraction lost 
   report to an appropriate tag of "low", "mediumö, or "high".

   <rule processing-point="4"> 
      <!-- invoke local services to insert label --> 
      <action>checkSystemLoad</action> 
      <action>checkConnectionStatus</action> 
      <!-- check the system load to determine using local or 
           remote services --> 
      <property name="system-processing-load" matches="high"> 
         <!-- System load is high, use remote services --> 
         <property name="r-fraction-lost" matches="high"> 
            <!-- high packets loss in end-user, 
                 adapts the video stream to small.  --> 
            <action>icap://video.adpat.server/video-adpat</action> 
         </property> 
      </property> 
      <property name="system-processing-load" matches="low|medium"> 
         <!-- System load is not high, use local services --> 
         <property name="r-fraction-lost" matches="high"> 
            <!-- high packets loss in end-user, 
                 adapts the video stream to small.  --> 
            <action>proxylet://localhost/video-adpat</action> 
         </property> 
      </property> 
   </rule> 
    
   The third example shows the adaptation of different content format 
   for different traffic conditions gathered from the network 
   monitoring module for a specific network node or a group of network 
   nodes in delivering Audio-Visual content. Access to the types of 
   content format is based on the different network conditions supplied 
   by the network monitoring module. The rule for accessing the type of 
   content format is being specified based on the type of property 
   used. 
     
   <rule processing-point="4"> 
      <!-- invoke local services to insert label --> 
      <action>checkBandwidth</action> 
      <!-- check the allocated bandwidth and adapts accordingly --> 
       <property name="r-jitter" matches="high"> 
         <!-- receiver jitter is high, adapt to use still pictures  --> 
         <action>proxylet://stillimage.server/jpeg-only</action> 
      </property> 
      <property name="r-jitter-diff" matches="low"> 
         <!-- jitter difference is low, resume previous content format 
         --> 
         <action>proxylet://content.server/resume</action> 
      </property> 
      <property name="r-fraction-lost" matches="High"> 
         <!-- receiver accumulated loss is high, suggest using Forward 
              error correction coded content --> 
         <action>proxlet://videoFEC.correct.server/video-FEC</action> 
      </property> 
   </rule>
