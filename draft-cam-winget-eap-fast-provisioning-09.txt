Internet-Draft     Dynamic Provisioning using EAP-FAST         July 2008


Abstract

   The flexible authentication via secure tunneling EAP method (EAP-
   FAST) enables secure communication between a peer and a server by
   using Transport Layer Security (TLS) to establish a mutually
   authenticated tunnel.  EAP-FAST also enables the provisioning
   credentials or other information through this protected tunnel.  This
   document describes the use of EAP-FAST for dynamic provisioning.

Internet-Draft     Dynamic Provisioning using EAP-FAST         July 2008


1.  Introduction

   EAP-FAST [RFC4851] is an EAP method that can be used to mutually
   authenticate peer and server.  Credentials such as a pre-shared key,
   certificate trust anchor or a Protected Access Credential (PAC) must
   be provisioned to the peer before it can establish mutual
   authentication with the server.  In many cases, the provisioning of
   such information presents deployment hurdles.  Through the use of the
   protected TLS [RFC4346] tunnel, EAP-FAST can enable dynamic in-band
   provisioning to address such deployment obstacles.

1.1.  Specification Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   Much of the terminology used in this document comes from [RFC3748].
   The terms "peer" and "server" are used interchangeably with the terms
   "EAP peer" and "EAP server" respectively.  Additional terms are
   defined below:

   Man in the Middle (MitM)

      An adversary that can successfully inject itself between a peer
      and EAP server.  The MitM succeeds by impersonating itself as a
      valid peer or server.

   Provisioning

      Providing peer with a trust anchor, shared secret or other
      appropriate information needed to establish a security
      association.

   Protected Access Credential (PAC)

      Credentials distributed to a peer for future optimized network
      authentication.  The PAC consists of at most three components: a
      shared secret, an opaque element and optional information.  The
      shared secret part contains the secret key shared between the peer
      and server.  The opaque part contains the shared secret encrypted
      by a private key only known to the server.  It is provided to the
      peer and is presented back to the server when the peer wishes to
      obtain access to network resources.  Finally, a PAC may optionally
      include other information that may be useful to the peer.

Internet-Draft     Dynamic Provisioning using EAP-FAST         July 2008


   Tunnel PAC

      A set of credentials stored by the peer and consumed by both the
      peer and the server to establish a TLS tunnel.

   User Authorization PAC

      A User Authorization PAC is server encrypted data containing
      authorization information associated with a previously
      authenticated user.  The user authorization PAC does not typically
      contain a key, but rather it is generally bound to a tunnel PAC
      which is used with the User Authorization PAC.

   Machine Authentication PAC

      A Machine Authentication PAC contains server encrypted data
      containing authorization information associated with a device.  A
      Machine Authentication PAC may be used instead of a tunnel PAC to
      establish the TLS tunnel to provide machine authentication and
      authorization information.  The Machine Authentication PAC is
      useful in cases where the machine needs to be authenticated and
      authorized to access a network before a user has logged in.

2.  EAP-FAST Provisioning Modes

   EAP-FAST supports two modes for provisioning:

   1.  Server-Authenticated Provisioning Mode - Provisioning inside a
       TLS tunnel that provides server-side authentication.

   2.  Server-Unauthenticated Provisioning Mode - Provisioning inside an
       anonymous TLS tunnel.

   The EAP-FAST provisioning modes use EAP-FAST phase 2 inside a secure
   TLS tunnel established during phase 1.  [RFC4851] describes the EAP-
   FAST phases in greater detail.

   In the Server-Authenticated Provisioning Mode, the peer has
   successfully authenticated the EAP server as part of EAP-FAST Phase 1
   (i.e.  TLS tunnel establishment).  Additional exchanges MAY occur
   inside the tunnel to allow the EAP Server to authenticate the EAP
   peer before provisioning any information.

   In the Server-Unauthenticated Provisioning Mode, an unauthenticated
   TLS tunnel is established in the EAP-FAST Phase 1.  The peer MUST
   negotiate a TLS anonymous Diffie-Hellman based cipher suite to signal
   that it wishes to use Server-Unauthenticateded Provisioning Mode.
   This provisioning mode enables the bootstrapping of peers where the
   peer lacks strong credentials usable for mutual authentication with
   the server.

   Since the server is not authenticated in the Server-Unauthenticated
   Provisioning Mode, it is possible that an attacker may intercept the
   TLS tunnel.  When using this mode, an inner, phase 2, EAP method
   SHOULD be used to provide authentication and man-in-the-middle
   detection as described in Section 6.  If an anonymous tunnel is used
   then the peer and server MUST negotiate and successfully complete an
   EAP method supporting mutual authentication and key derivation.  The
   peer then uses the Crypto-Binding TLV to validate the integrity of
   the TLS tunnel, thereby verifying that the exchange was not subject
   to a man-in-the-middle attack.

   Server-Authenticated mode protects against the man-in-the-middle,
   however it requires provisioning the peer with credentials necessary
   to authenticate the server.  Environments willing to trade off the
   security risk of a man-in-the-middle for ease of deployment can
   choose to use the Server-Unauthenticated mode.

   Assuming that an inner EAP method and Crypto-Binding TLV exchange is
   successful, the server will subsequently provide credential
   information, such as a shared key using a PAC TLV or the trusted

   certificate root(s) of the server using a Server-Trusted-Root TLV.
   Once the EAP-FAST Provisioning conversation completes, the peer is
   expected to use the provisioned credentials in subsequent EAP-FAST
   authentications.

3.  Dynamic Provisioning using EAP-FAST Conversation

   The provisioning occurs in the following steps which are detailed in
   the subsequent sections and in RFC 4851.  First the EAP-FAST phase 1
   TLS tunnel is established.  During this process extra material is
   extracted from the TLS key derivation for use as challenges in the
   subsequent authentication exchange.  Next, EAP-MSCHAPv2 is executed
   within the EAP-FAST phase 2 TLS tunnel to authenticate the client
   using the challenges derived from the phase 1 TLS exchange.
   Following successful authentication and Crypto-Binding TLV exchange,
   the server provisions the peer with PAC information including the
   secret PAC key and the PAC opaque.  Finally, the EAP-FAST
   conversation completes with Result TLV exchanges defined in RFC 4851.
   The exported EAP MSK and EMSK are derived from a combination of the
   tunnel key material and key material from the EAP-MSCHAPv2 exchange.

3.1.  Phase 1 TLS tunnel

3.1.1.  Server-Authenticated Phase 1

   The provisioning EAP-FAST exchange uses the same sequence as the EAP-
   FAST authentication phase 1 to establish a protected TLS tunnel.
   Implementations supporting this version of the Sever-Authenticated
   Provisioning Mode MUST support the following TLS ciphersuites defined
   in [RFC4346]:

      TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA
      TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
      TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA

   Other TLS ciphersuites that provide server authentication and
   encryption MAY be supported.  The server MAY authenticate the peer
   during the TLS handshake in Server-Authenticated Provisioning Mode.
   To adhere to best security practices, it is highly RECOMMENDED that
   the peer validate the server's certificate chain when performing
   server-side authentication to obtain the full security benefits of
   Server-Authenticated provisioning.

3.1.2.  Server-Unauthenticated Phase 1

   Implementations supporting this version of the Sever-Unauthenticated
   Provisioning Mode MUST support the following TLS ciphersuites defined
   in [RFC4346]:

      TLS_DH_anon_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA

   Anonymous ciphersuites SHOULD NOT be allowed outside of EAP-FAST
   Server-Unauthenticated Provisioning Mode.  Ciphersuites that are used

   for provisioning MUST provide encryption.

3.2.  Phase 2 - Tunneled Authentication and Provisioning

   Once a protected tunnel is established, the peer and server MAY wish
   to execute additional authentication and perform checks on the
   integrity of the TLS tunnel.  As defined in [RFC4851] the
   authentication exchange will be followed by an Intermediate-Result
   TLV and a Crypto-Binding TLV if the EAP method succeeded.  The
   Crypto-Binding TLV provides a check on the integrity of the tunnel
   with respect to the endpoints of the EAP method.  If the preceding is
   successful than a provisioning exchange MAY take place.  The
   provisioning exchange will use a PAC TLV exchange if a PAC is being
   provisioned and a Server-Trusted-Root TLV if a trusted root
   certificate is being provisioned.  The provisioning MAY be solicited
   by the peer or it MAY be unsolicited.  The PAC TLV exchange consists
   of the server distributing the PAC in a corresponding PAC TLV to the
   peer and the peer confirming its receipt in a final PAC TLV
   Acknowledgement message.  The peer may also use the PAC TLV to
   request that the server send a PAC.  The provision TLVs MAY be
   piggybacked on the Result TLV, following the Result TLV.  A PAC TLV
   MUST NOT be accepted if it is not encapsulated in an encrypted TLS
   tunnel.

   A fresh PAC MAY be distributed if the server detects that the PAC is
   expiring soon.  In-band PAC refreshing is through the PAC TLV
   mechanism.  The decision to refresh or not to refresh the PAC is
   determined by the server.  Based on the PAC-Opaque information, the
   server MAY determine not to refresh a peer's PAC even if the PAC-Key
   has expired.

3.2.1.  Server-Authenticated Tunneled Authentication

   If Server-Authenticated Mode is in use then any EAP method may be
   used within the TLS tunnel to authenticate the peer that is allowed
   by the peer's policy.

3.2.2.  Server-Unauthenticated Tunneled Authentication

   If Server-Unauthenticated Mode is in use then peer authenticates the
   server and the server authenticates the peer within the tunnel.  The
   only method for performing authentication defined in this version of
   EAP-FAST is EAP-MSCHAPv2 [EAP-MSCHAPv2] in a special way as described
   in the following section.  It is possible for other methods to be
   defined to perform this authentication in the future.

Internet-Draft     Dynamic Provisioning using EAP-FAST         July 2008


3.2.3.  Authenticating Using EAP-MSCHAPv2

   Implementations of this version of the EAP-FAST Server-
   Unauthenticated Provisioning Mode MUST support EAP-MSCHAPv2
   [EAP-MSCHAPv2] as the inner authentication method.  While other
   authentication methods exist, EAP-MSCHAPv2 was chosen for several
   reasons:

   o  Provide the ability of slowing an active attack by using a hash
      based challenge-response protocol.

   o  The use of a challenge response protocol such as MSCHAPv2 provides
      some ability to detect a man-in-the-middle attack during Server-
      Unauthenticated Provisioning Mode.

   o  A large deployed base is already able to support MSCHAPv2

   o  It allows support for password change during the EAP-FAST
      provisioning modes.

   When using an anonymous Diffie-Hellman key agreement and EAP-
   MSCHAPv2, a binding between the tunnel and the EAP-MSCHAPv2 exchanges
   is formed by using keying material generated during the EAP-FAST
   tunnel establishment as the EAP-MSCHAPv2 challenges instead of using
   the challenges exchanged within the protocol itself.  A detailed
   description of the challenge generation is described in Section 3.3.

   The MSCHAPv2 [RFC2759] exchange forces the server to provide a valid
   ServerChallengeResponse which must be a function of the server
   challenge, peer challenge and password as part of its response.  This
   reduces the window of vulnerability of a man-in-the-middle spoofing
   the server, by requiring the attacker to successfully break the
   password within the peer's challenge response time limit.

3.2.4.  Use of other Inner EAP Methods for EAP-FAST Provisioning

   Once a protected tunnel is established, typically the peer
   authenticates itself to the server before the server can provision
   the peer.  If the authentication mechanism does not support mutual
   authentication and protection from man-in-the-middle attacks then
   Server-Authenticated Provisioning Mode MUST be used.  Within a server
   side authenticated tunnel authentication mechanisms such as EAP-GTC
   [I-D.zhou-emu-fast-gtc] MAY be used.  This will enable peers using
   other authentication mechanisms such as password database and one-
   time passwords to be provisioned in-band as well.  This version of
   the EAP-FAST provisioning mode implementation MUST support both EAP-
   GTC and EAP-MSCHAPv2 within the tunnel in Server-Authenticated
   Provisioning Mode.

   It should be noted that Server-Authenticated Provisioning Mode
   provides significant security advantages over Server-Unauthenticated
   Provisioning Mode even when EAP-MSCHAPv2 is being used as the inner
   method.  It protects the EAP-MSCHAPv2 exchanges from potential active
   MitM attacks by verifying server's authenticity before exchanging
   MSCHAPv2.  Server-Authenticated Provisioning Mode is the recommended
   provisioning mode.  The EAP-FAST peer MUST use the Server-
   Authenticated Provisioning Mode whenever it is configured with valid
   trust root for a particular server.

3.3.  Key Derivations Used in the EAP-FAST Provisioning Exchange

   The TLS tunnel key is calculated according to the TLS [RFC4346] with
   an extra 72 octets of key material.  Portions of the extra 72 octets
   are used for the EAP-FAST provisioning exchange session key seed and
   as the random challenges in the EAP-MSCHAPv2 exchange.

   To generate the key material, compute


             key_block = PRF(master_secret,
                            "key expansion",
                            server_random +
                            client_random);

   until enough output has been generated.

   Then the key_block is partitioned as follows:

             client_write_MAC_secret[hash_size]
             server_write_MAC_secret[hash_size]
             client_write_key[Key_material_length]
             server_write_key[key_material_length]
             client_write_IV[IV_size]
             server_write_IV[IV_size]
             session_key_seed[40]
             MSCHAPv2 ServerChallenge[16]
             MSCHAPv2 ClientChallenge[16]

   The extra key material, session_key_seed is used for the EAP-FAST
   Crypto-Binding TLV exchange while the ServerChallenge and
   ClientChallenge correspond to the authentication server's MSCHAPv2
   challenge and the peer's MSCHAPv2 challenge respectively.  The
   ServerChallenge and ClientChallenge are only used for the MSCHAPv2
   exchange when Diffie-Hellman anonymous key agreement is used in the
   EAP-FAST tunnel establishment.

   The provisioning modes of EAP-FAST does not change the general EAP-
   FAST protocol and thus how the Peer-Id, Server-Id and Session-Id are
   determined is based on the [RFC4851] techniques.

   [RFC4851] Section 3.4 describes how the Peer-Id and Server-Id are
   determined; Section 3.5 describes how the Session-Id is generated.

3.5.  Network Access after EAP-FAST Provisioning

   After successful provisioning, network access MAY be granted or
   denied depending upon server policy.  For example, in the Server-
   Authenticated Provisioning Mode, access can be granted after the EAP
   server has authenticated the peer and provisioned the peer with a
   Tunnel PAC (i.e. a PAC used to mutually authenticate and establish
   the EAP-FAST tunnel).  Additionally, peer policy MAY instruct the
   peer to disconnect the current provisioning connection and initiate a
   new EAP-FAST exchange for authentication utilizing the newly
   provisioned information.  At the end of the Server-Unauthenticated
   Provisioning Mode, network access SHOULD NOT be granted as this
   conversation is intended for provisioning only and thus no network
   access is authorized.  The server MAY grant access at the end of a
   successful Server-Authenticated provisioning exchange.

   If after successful provisioning access to the network is denied, the
   EAP Server SHOULD conclude with an EAP Failure.  The EAP Server SHALL
   NOT grant network access or distribute any session keys to the NAS if
   this exchange is not intended to provide network access.  Even though
   provisioning mode completes with a successful inner termination (e.g.
   successful Result TLV), server policy defines whether the peer gains
   network access or not.  Thus, it is feasible for the server, while
   providing a successful Result TLV may conclude that its
   authentication policy was not satisfied and terminate the
   conversation with an EAP Failure.

   The EAP-FAST server, when denying network access after EAP-FAST
   Provisioning, MAY choose to instead, immediately invoke another EAP-
   FAST Start and thus initiate the EAP-FAST Phase 1 conversation.  This
   server based implementation policy MAY be chosen to avoid
   applications such as wireless devices from being disrupted (e.g. in
   IEEE 802.11 devices, an EAP Failure may trigger a full 802.11
   disassociation) and allow them to smoothly transition to the
   subsequent EAP-FAST authentications to enable network access.  As an
   alternative, both the peer and server can initiate TLS renegotiation,
   where the newly provisioned credentials can be used to establish a
   server authenticated or mutually authenticated TLS tunnel for
   authentication.  Upon completion of the TLS negotiation and

   subsequent authentication, normal network access policy on EAP-FAST
   authentication can be applied.

4.  Information Provisioned in EAP-FAST

   Multiple types of credentials MAY be provisioned within EAP-FAST.
   The most common credential is the Tunnel PAC that is used to
   establish the EAP-FAST phase 1 tunnel.  In addition to the Tunnel
   PAC, other types of credentials and information can also be
   provisioned through EAP-FAST.  They may include trusted root
   certificates, PACs for specific purposes, and user identities to name
   a few.  Typically, provisioning is invoked after both peer and server
   authenticate each other and after a successful Crypto-Binding TLV
   exchange.  However, depending on the information being provisioned,
   mutual authentication MAY not be needed.

   At minimum, either the peer or server must prove authenticity before
   credentials are provisioned to ensure that information is not freely
   provisioned to or by adversaries.  For example, the EAP server may
   not need to authenticate the peer to provision the peer with trusted
   root certificates.  However, the peer SHOULD authenticate the server
   before it can accept a trusted server root certificate.

4.1.  Protected Access Credential

   A Protected Access Credential (PAC) is a security credential
   generated by the server that holds information specific to a peer.
   The server distributes all PAC information through the use of a PAC
   TLV.  Different types of PAC information are identified through the
   PAC Type and other PAC attributes defined in this section.  This
   document defines three types of PACs: a Tunnel PAC, a Machine
   Authentication PAC and a User Authorization PAC.

4.1.1.  Tunnel PAC

   The server distributes the Tunnel PAC to the peer, which uses it in
   subsequent attempts to establish a secure EAP-FAST TLS tunnel with
   the server.  The Tunnel PAC includes a secret key (PAC-Key), data
   that is opaque to the peer (PAC-Opaque) and other information (PAC-
   Info) which the peer can interpret.  The opaque data is generated by
   the server and cryptographically protected so it cannot be modified
   or interpreted by the peer.  The Tunnel PAC conveys the server policy
   of what must and can occur in the protected phase 2 tunnel.  It is up
   to the server policy to include what is necessary in a PAC-Opaque to
   enforce the policy in subsequent TLS handshakes.  For example, user
   identity, I-ID, can be included as the part of the server policy.
   This I-ID information limits the inner EAP methods to be carried only
   on the specified user identity.  Other types of information can also
   be included, such as which EAP method(s) and which TLS ciphersuites
   are allowed.  If the server policy is not included in a PAC-Opaque,
   then there is no limitation imposed by the PAC on the usage of the

   inner EAP methods or user identities inside the tunnel established by
   the use of that PAC.

4.1.2.  Machine Authentication PAC

   The Machine Authentication PAC contains information in the PAC opaque
   that identifies the machine.  It is meant to be used by a machine
   when network access is required and no user is logged in.  Typically
   a server will only grant the minimal amount of access required for a
   machine without a user present based on the Machine Authentication
   PAC.  The Machine Authentication PAC MAY be provisioned during the
   authentication of a user.  It SHOULD be stored by the peer in a
   location that is only accessible to the machine.  This type of PAC is
   typically persisted across sessions.

   The peer can use the Machine Authentication PAC as the Tunnel PAC to
   establish the TLS tunnel.  The EAP server MAY have a policy to bypass
   additional inner EAP method and grant limited network access based on
   information in the Machine Authentication PAC.  Server MAY request
   additional exchanges to validate machine's other authorization
   criteria, such as posture information etc., before granting network
   access.

4.1.3.  User Authorization PAC

   The User Authorization PAC contains information in the PAC opaque
   that identifies a user and provides authorization information.  The
   User Authorization PAC is used to provide user information during
   stateless session resume so user authentication MAY be skipped.  The
   User Authorization PAC MAY be provisioned during a user
   authentication.  It is meant to be short lived and not persisted
   across logon sessions.  The User Authorization PAC SHOULD only be
   available to the user for which it is provisioned.  The User
   Authorization PAC SHOULD be deleted from the peer when the local
   authorization state of a user's session changes, such as upon the
   user logs out.

   Once the EAP-FAST phase 1 TLS tunnel is established the peer MAY
   present a User Authorization PAC to the server in a PAC TLV.  This is
   sent as TLS application data, but it MAY be included in the same
   message as the Finished Handshake message sent by the peer.  The User
   Authorization PAC MUST only be sent within the protection of an
   encrypted tunnel to an authenticated entity.  The server will decrypt
   the PAC and evaluate the contents.  If the contents are valid and the
   server policy allows the session to be resumed based on this
   information then the server will complete the session resumption and
   grant access to the peer without requiring an inner authentication
   method.  This is called stateless session resume in EAP-FAST.  In



Cam-Winget, et al.      Expires January 30, 2009               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft     Dynamic Provisioning using EAP-FAST         July 2008


   this case the server sends the Result TLV indicating success without
   the Crypto-Binding TLV and the peer sends back a Result TLV
   indicating success.  If the User Authorization PAC fails the server
   validation or the server policy the server MAY either reject the
   request or continue with performing full user authentication within
   the tunnel.

4.1.4.  PAC Provisioning

   To request provisioning of a PAC, a peer sends a PAC TLV containing a
   PAC attribute of PAC Type set to the appropriate value.  For a Tunnel
   PAC the value is '1', for a Machine Authentication PAC the value is
   '2' and for a User Authorization PAC the value is '3'.  The request
   MAY be issued after the peer has determined that it has successfully
   authenticated the EAP Server and validated the Crypto-Binding TLV to
   ensure that the TLS tunnel's integrity is intact.  Since anonymous DH
   ciphersuites are only allowed for provisioning a Tunnel PAC, if an
   anonymous ciphersuite is negotiated the Tunnel PAC MAY be provisioned
   automatically by the server.  The peer MUST send separate PAC TLVs
   for each type of PAC they want to provision.  Multiple PAC TLVs can
   be sent in the same packet or different packets.  When requesting the
   Machine Authentication PAC the peer SHOULD include an I-ID TLV
   containing the machine name prefixed by "host/".  The EAP server will
   send the PACs after its internal policy has been satisfied; or it MAY
   ignore the request or request additional authentications if its
   policy dictates.  If a peer receives a PAC with unknown type, it MUST
   ignore it.

   A PAC-TLV containing PAC-Acknowledge Attribute MUST be sent by peer
   to acknowledge the receipt of the Tunnel PAC.  PAC-Acknowledge TLV
   MUST NOT be used from peer to acknowledge the receipt of other types
   of PACs.

   Please see Appendix A.1 for an example of packet exchanges to
   provision a Tunnel PAC.

4.2.  PAC TLV Format

   The PAC TLV provides support for provisioning the Protected Access
   Credential (PAC) defined within [RFC4851].  The PAC TLV carries the
   PAC and related information within PAC attribute fields.
   Additionally, the PAC TLV MAY be used by the peer to request
   provisioning of a PAC of the type specified in the PAC Type PAC
   Attribute.  The PAC TLV MUST only be used in a protected tunnel
   providing encryption and integrity protection.  A general PAC TLV
   format is defined as follows:

   the server wishes to issue or renew a PAC that is bound to a key such
   as a Tunnel PAC.  The key is a randomly generated octet string 32
   octets in length.  The key is represented as an octet string.  The
   generator of this key is the issuer of the credential, identified by
   the A-ID.

4.2.3.  PAC-Opaque

   The PAC-Opaque field is included within the PAC TLV whenever the
   server wishes to issue or renew a PAC.

   The PAC-Opaque is opaque to the peer and thus the peer MUST NOT
   attempt to interpret it.  A peer that has been issued a PAC-Opaque by
   a server stores that data, and presents it back to the server
   according to its PAC Type.  The Tunnel PAC is used in the ClientHello
   SessionTicket extension field defined in [RFC5077].  If a peer has
   opaque data issued to it by multiple servers, then it stores the data
   issued by each server separately according to A-ID.  This requirement
   allows the peer to maintain and use each opaque data as an
   independent PAC pairing, with a PAC-Key mapping to a PAC-Opaque
   identified by the A-ID.  As there is a one to one correspondence
   between PAC-Key and PAC-Opaque, the peer determines the PAC-Key and
   corresponding PAC-Opaque based on the A-ID provided in the EAP-FAST/
   Start message and the A-ID provided in the PAC-Info when it was
   provisioned with a PAC-Opaque.

   The PAC-Opaque field format is summarized as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   the PAC-Info to provide more information to the peer.  The PAC-Info

         3 - PAC-LIFETIME

            This is a 4 octet quantity representing the expiration time
            of the credential in UNIX UTC time.  This attribute MAY be
            provided to the peer as part of PAC-Info.

         4 - A-ID

            A-ID is the identity of the authority that issued the PAC.
            The A-ID is intended to be unique across all issuing servers
            to avoid namespace collisions.  The A-ID is used by the peer
            to determine which PAC to employ.  This attribute MUST be
            included in the PAC-Info attribute.  The A-ID MUST match the
            A-ID the server used to establish the tunnel.  Since many
            existing implementations expect the A-ID to be 16 octets in
            length, it is RECOMMENDED that length of an A-ID be 16
            octets for maximum interoperability.

         5 - I-ID

            Initiator identifier (I-ID) is the peer identity associated
            with the credential.  The server employs the I-ID in the
            EAP-FAST Phase 2 conversation to validate that the same peer
            identity used to execute EAP-FAST Phase 1 is also used in at
            minimum one inner EAP method in EAP-FAST Phase 2.  If the
            server is enforcing the I-ID validation on inner EAP method,
            then I-ID MUST be included in PAC-Info, to enable the peer
            to also enforce a unique PAC for each unique user.  If I-ID
            is missing from the PAC-Info, it is assumed that the Tunnel
            PAC can be used for multiple users and peer will not enforce
            the unique Tunnel PAC per user policy.

         7 - A-ID-Info

            Authority Identifier Information is a mandatory TLV intended
            to provide a user-friendly name for the A-ID.  It may
            contain the enterprise name and server name in a human-
            readable format.  This TLV serves as an aid to the peer to
            better inform the end-user about the A-ID.  The name is
            encoded as UTF-8 [RFC3629] format.  This attribute MUST be
            included in the PAC-Info.

         10 - PAC-type

            PAC-Type is a mandatory TLV intended to provide the type of
            PAC.  This field SHOULD be included in the PAC-Info.  If
            PAC-Type is not present, then it defaults to a Tunnel PAC
            (Type 1).

4.2.5.  PAC-Acknowledgement TLV

   The PAC-Acknowledgement is used to acknowledge the receipt of the
   Tunnel PAC by the peer.  The peer includes the PAC-Acknowledgement
   TLV in a PAC-TLV sent to the server to indicate the result of the
   processing and storing of a newly provisioned Tunnel PAC.  This TLV
   is only used when Tunnel PAC is provisioned.

            2 - Failure

4.2.6.  PAC-Type TLV

   The PAC-Type TLV is a TLV intended to specify the PAC type.  It is

            1 - Tunnel PAC
            2 - Machine Authentication PAC
            3 - User Authorization PAC

4.3.  Trusted Server Root Certificate

   Server-Trusted-Root TLV facilitates the request and delivery of a
   trusted server root certificate.  The Server-Trusted-Root TLV can be
   exchanged in regular EAP-FAST Authentication mode or Provisioning
   mode.  The Server-Trusted-Root TLV is always marked as optional, and
   cannot be responded to with a NAK TLV.  The Server-Trusted-Root TLV
   MUST only be sent as an inner TLV (inside the protection of the
   tunnel).

   After the peer has determined that it has successfully authenticated
   the EAP server and validated the Crypto-Binding TLV, it MAY send one
   or more Server-Trusted-Root TLVs (marked as optional) to request the
   trusted server root certificates from from the EAP server.  The EAP
   server MAY send one or more root certificates with a PKCS#7 TLV
   inside Server-Trusted-Root TLV.  The EAP server MAY also choose not
   to honor the request.  Please see Section Appendix A.3 for an example
   of a server provisioning a server trusted root certificate.

4.3.1.  Server-Trusted-Root TLV

   The Server-Trusted-Root TLV allows the peer to send a request to the
   EAP server for a list of trusted roots.  The server may respond with
   one or more root certificates in PKCS#7 [RFC2315] format.

   If the EAP server sets credential format to PKCS#7-Server-
   Certificate-Root, then the Server-Trusted-Root TLV should contain the
   root of the certificate chain of the certificate issued to the EAP
   server packaged in a PKCS#7 TLV.  If the Server certificate is a

   self-signed certificate, then the root is the self-signed
   certificate.

   If the Server-Trusted-Root TLV credential format contains a value
   unknown to the peer, then the EAP peer should ignore the TLV.

   The Server-Trusted-Root TLV is defined as follows:

4.3.2.  PKCS#7 TLV

   The PKCS#7 TLV is sent by the EAP server to the peer inside the
   Server-Trusted-Root TLV.  It contains the PKCS #7 [RFC2315] wrapped
   X.509 certificate.  This field contains a certificate or certificate
   chain in PKCS#7 format requested by the peer as defined in [RFC2315].

   The PKCS#7 TLV is always marked as optional, which cannot be
   responded to with a NAK TLV.  EAP-FAST server implementations that
   claim to support the dynamic provisioning defined in this document
   SHOULD support this TLV.  EAP-FAST peer implementations MAY support
   this TLV.

   If the PKCS#7 TLV contains a certificate or certificate chain that is
   not acceptable to the peer, then peer MUST ignore the TLV.

   The PKCS#7 TLV is defined as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3

5.  IANA Considerations

   This section explains the criteria to be used by the IANA for
   assignment of Type value in PAC attribute, PAC Type value in PAC-
   Type TLV, Credential-Format value in Server-Trusted-Root TLV.  The
   "Specification Required" policy is used here with the meaning defined
   in BCP 26 [RFC2434].

   A registry of values is needed for the PAC Attribute types.  The
   initial values to populate the registry are:


      1 - PAC-Key
      2 - PAC-Opaque
      3 - PAC-Lifetime
      4 - A-ID
      5 - I-ID
      6 - Reserved
      7 - A-ID-Info
      8 - PAC-Acknowledgement
      9 - PAC-Info
      10 - PAC-Type

   Values from 11 to 63 are reserved.  Values 64 to 255 are assigned
   with a "Specification Required" policy.

   A registry of values is needed for PAC-Type values used in the PAC-
   Type TLV.  The initial values to populate the registry are:

      1 - Tunnel PAC

      2 - Machine Authentication PAC

      3 - User Authorization PAC

   Values from 4 to 63 are reserved.  Values 64 to 255 are assigned with
   a "Specification Required" policy.

   A registry of values is needed for Credential-Format values used in
   Server-Trusted-Root TLV.  The initial values to populate the registry
   are:

      1 - PKCS#7-Server-Certificate-Root

   Values from 2 to 63 are reserved.  Values 64 to 255 are assigned with

6.  Security Considerations

   The Dynamic Provisioning EAP-FAST protocol shares the same security
   considerations outlined in [RFC4851].  Additionally, it also has its
   unique security considerations described below:

6.1.  Provisioning Modes and Man-in-the-middle Attacks

   EAP-FAST can be invoked in two different provisioning modes: Server-
   Authenticated Provisioning Mode and Server-Unauthenticated
   Provisioning Mode.  Each mode provides different levels of resistance
   to man-in-the-middle attacks.  The following list identifies some of
   the problems associated with a man-in-the-middle attack:

   o  Disclosure of secret information such as keys, identities and
      credentials to an attacker

   o  Spoofing of a valid server to a peer and the distribution of false
      credentials

   o  Spoofing of a valid peer and receiving credentials generated for
      that peer

   o  Denial of service

6.1.1.  Server-Authenticated Provisioning Mode and Man-in-the-middle
        Attacks

   In Server-Authenticated Provisioning Mode the TLS handshake assures
   protected communications with the server because the peer must have
   been securely pre-provisioned with the trust roots and/or other
   authentication information necessary to authenticate the server
   during the handshake.  This pre-provisioning step prevents an
   attacker from inserting themselves as a man-in-the-middle of the
   communications.  Unfortunately, secure pre-provisioning can be
   difficult to achieve in many environments.

   Cryptographic binding of inner authentication mechanisms to the TLS
   tunnel provides additional protection from man-in-the-middle attacks
   resulting from the tunneling of authentication mechanism.

   Server-Authenticated Provisioning Mode provides a high degree of
   protection from man-in-the-middle attacks.

6.1.2.  Server-Unauthenticated Provisioning Mode and Man-in-the-middle
        Attacks

   In Server-Unauthenticated Provisioning Mode the TLS handshake does



Cam-Winget, et al.      Expires January 30, 2009               [Page 27]

Internet-Draft     Dynamic Provisioning using EAP-FAST         July 2008


   not assure protected communications with the server because either an
   anonymous handshake is negotiated or the peer lacks the necessary
   information to complete the authentication of the server.  This
   allows an attacker to insert themselves in the middle of the TLS
   communications.

   EAP-FAST Server-Unauthenticated Provisioning Mode mitigates the man-
   in-the-middle attack through the following techniques:

   o  Binding the phase 2 authentication method to secret values derived
      from the phase 1 TLS exchange:

      In the case of MSCHAPv2 used with an anonymous Diffie-Hellman
      ciphersuite the challenges for the MSCHAPv2 exchange are derived
      from the TLS handshake and are not transmitted within the MSCHAPv2
      exchange.  Since the man-in-the-middle does not know these
      challenges it cannot successfully impersonate the server without
      cracking the MSCHAPv2 message from the peer before the peer times
      out.

   o  Cryptographic binding of secret values derived from the phase 2
      authentication exchange with secret values derived from the phase
      1 TLS exchange:

      This makes use of the cryptographic binding exchange defined
      within EAP-FAST to discover the presence of a man-in-the-middle by
      binding secret information obtained from the phase 2 MSCHAPv2
      exchange with secret information from the phase 1 TLS exchange.

   While it would be sufficient to only support the cryptographic
   binding to mitigate the MitM; the binding of the MSCHAPv2 random
   challenge derivations to the TLS key agreement protocol enables early
   detection of a man-in-the-middle attack.  This guards against
   adversaries who may otherwise relay the inner EAP authentication
   messages between the true peer and server and enforces that the
   adversary successfully respond with a valid challenge response.

   This document specifies MSCHAPv2 as the inner authentication
   exchange, however it is possible that other inner authentications
   mechanisms to authenticate the tunnel may be developed in the future.
   Since the strength of the man-in-the-middle protection is directly
   dependent on the strength of the inner method it is RECOMMENDED that
   any inner method used provide at least as much resistance to attack
   as MSCHAPv2.  Cleartext passwords MUST NOT be used in Server-
   Unauthenticated Provisioning Mode.  Note that an active man-in-the-
   middle may observe phase 2 authentication method exchange until the
   point that the peer determines that authentication mechanism fails or
   is aborted.  This allows for the disclosure of sensitive information



Cam-Winget, et al.      Expires January 30, 2009               [Page 28]

Internet-Draft     Dynamic Provisioning using EAP-FAST         July 2008


   such as identity or authentication protocol exchanges to the man-in-
   the-middle.

   The ciphersuite used to establish phase 1 of the Server-
   Unauthenticated provisioning mode MUST be one in which both the peer
   and server provide contribution to the derived TLS master key.  The
   authenticated ephemeral Diffie-Hellman ciphersuites provide this type
   of key agreement.

6.2.  Dictionary Attacks

   It is often the case that phase 2 authentication mechanisms are based
   on password credentials.  These exchanges may be vulnerable to both
   online and offline dictionary attacks.  The two provisioning modes
   provide various degrees of protection from these attacks.

   In online dictionary attacks the attacker attempts to discover the
   password by repeated attempts at authentication using a guessed
   password.  Neither mode prevents this type of attack by itself.
   Implementations should provide controls that limit how often an
   attacker can execute authentication attempts.

   In offline dictionary attacks the attacker captures information which
   can be processed offline to recover the password.  Server-
   Authenticated provisioning mode provides effecting mitigation because
   the peer will not engage in phase 2 authentication without first
   authenticating the server during phase 1.  Server-Unauthenticated
   Provisioning Mode is vulnerable to this type of attack.  If, during
   phase 2 authentication, a peer receives no response or an invalid
   response from the server then there is a possibility there is a man-
   in-the-middle attack in progress.  Implementations SHOULD logs these
   events and , if possible, provide warnings to the user.
   Implementations are also encouraged to provide controls that limit
   how and where Server-Unauthenticated Provisioning Mode can be
   performed that are appropriate to their environment.  For example, an
   implementation may limit this mode to be used only on certain
   interfaces or require user intervention before allowing this mode if
   provisioning has succeeded in the past.

   Another mitigation technique that should not be overlooked is the
   choice of good passwords that have sufficient complexity and length
   and a password changing policy that requires regular password
   changes.

6.3.  Considerations in Selecting a Provisioning Mode

   Since Server-Authenticated Provisioning Mode provides much better
   protection from attacks than Server-Unauthenticated Provisioning



Cam-Winget, et al.      Expires January 30, 2009               [Page 29]

Internet-Draft     Dynamic Provisioning using EAP-FAST         July 2008


   Mode, Server-Authenticated mode should be used whenever possible.
   The Server-Unauthenticated Provisioning Mode provides a viable option
   as there may be deployments that can physically confine devices
   during the provisioning or are willing to accept the risk of an
   active dictionary attack.  Further, it is the only option that
   enables zero touch provisioning and facilitates simpler deployments
   requiring little to no peer configuration.  The peer MAY choose to
   use alternative secure out-of-band mechanisms for PAC provisioning
   that afford better security than the Server Unauthenticated
   Provisioning Mode.

6.4.  Diffie-Hellman Groups

   Implementations of EAP-FAST anonymous provisioning modes MUST support
   the Diffie-Hellman groups defined in [RFC3526].

   The security of the DH key exchange is based on the difficulty of
   solving the Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP).  As algorithms and
   adversaries become more efficient in their abilities to pre-compute
   values for a given fixed group, it becomes more important for a
   server to generate new groups as a means to allay this threat.  EAP-
   FAST servers in closed environments may make use of groups outside
   [RFC3526].  The server could, for instance, constantly compute new
   groups in the background.  Peers in these environments need to employ
   proper parameter validation.  Such an example is cited in [RFC4419].

   The server can maintain a list of safe primes and corresponding
   generators to choose from.  A prime p is safe, if:

   p = 2q + 1 and q is prime

   Initial implementations of the EAP-FAST provisioning exchange limit
   the generator to be 2 as it both improves the multiplication
   efficiency and still covers half of the space of possible residues.

   Additionally, since the EAP-FAST provisioning exchange employs DH per
   [RFC3268] to generate AES keys, the DH keys should provide enough
   entropy to ensure that a strong 128bit results from the DH key
   agreement.

6.5.  Tunnel PAC Usage

   The basic usage of the Tunnel PAC is to establish the TLS tunnel.  In
   this operation it does not have to provide user authentication as it
   is expected for user authentication to be carried out in phase 2 of
   EAP-FAST.  The EAP-FAST Tunnel PAC MAY contain information about the
   identity of a peer to prevent a particular tunnel PAC from being used
   to establish a tunnel which can perform phase 2 authenticate other



Cam-Winget, et al.      Expires January 30, 2009               [Page 30]

Internet-Draft     Dynamic Provisioning using EAP-FAST         July 2008


   peers.  While it is possible for the server to accept the Tunnel PAC
   as authentication for the peer many current implementations do not do
   this.  The ability to use PAC to authenticate peers and provide
   authorizations will be the subject of a future document.  [RFC5077]
   gives an example PAC opaque format in the Recommended Ticket
   Construction section.

6.6.  Machine Authentication PAC Usage

   In general the Machine Authorization PAC is expected to provide the
   minimum access required by a machine without a user.  This will
   typically be a subset of the privilege a registered user has.  The
   server provisioning the PAC should include information necessary to
   validate it at a later point in time.  This would include expiration
   information.  The Machine Authentication PAC includes a key so it can
   be used as a Tunnel PAC.  The PAC key MUST be kept secret by the
   peer.

6.7.  User Authorization PAC Usage

   The User Authorization PAC provides the privilege associated with a
   user.  The server provisioning the PAC should include the information
   necessary to validate it at a later point in time.  This includes
   expiration and other information associated with the PAC.  The User
   Authorization PAC is typically used as a bearer credential such that
   it does not have a key that used to authenticate its ownership.  For
   this reason this type of PAC MUST NOT be sent in the clear.  For
   additional protection the PAC MAY be bound to a Tunnel PAC used to
   establish the TLS tunnel.  On the peer, the User authorization PAC
   SHOULD only be accessible by the user for which it is provisioned.

6.8.  PAC Storage Considerations

   The main goal of EAP-FAST is to protect the authentication stream
   over the media link.  However, host security is still an issue.  Some
   care should be taken to protect the PAC on both the peer and server.
   The peer must store securely both the PAC-Key and PAC-Opaque, while
   the server must secure storage of its security association context
   used to consume the PAC-Opaque.  Additionally, if alternate
   provisioning is employed, the transportation mechanism used to
   distribute the PAC must also be secured.

   Most of the attacks described here would require some level of effort
   to execute; conceivably greater than their value.  The main focus
   therefore, should be to ensure that proper protections are used on
   both the peer and server.  There are a number of potential attacks
   which can be considered against secure key storage such as:




Cam-Winget, et al.      Expires January 30, 2009               [Page 31]

Internet-Draft     Dynamic Provisioning using EAP-FAST         July 2008


   o  Weak Passphrases

      On the peer side, keys are usually protected by a passphrase.  On
      some environments, this passphrase may be associated with the
      user's password.  In either case, if an attacker can obtain the
      encrypted key for a range of users, he may be able to successfully
      attack a weak passphrase.  The tools are already in place today to
      enable an attacker to easily attack all users in an enterprise
      environment through the use of email viruses and other techniques.

   o  Key Finding Attacks

      Key finding attacks are usually mentioned in reference to web
      servers, where the private SSL key may be stored securely, but at
      some point it must be decrypted and stored in system memory.  An
      attacker with access to system memory can actually find the key by
      identifying their mathematical properties.  To date, this attack
      appears to be purely theoretical and primarily acts to argue
      strongly for secure access controls on the server itself to
      prevent such unauthorized code from executing.

   o  Key duplication, Key substitution, Key modification

      Once keys are accessible to an attacker on either the peer or
      server, they fall under three forms of attack: key duplication,
      key substitution and key modification.  The first option would be
      the most common, allowing the attacker to masquerade as the user
      in question.  The second option could have some use if an attacker
      could implement it on the server.  Alternatively, an attacker
      could use one of the latter two attacks on either the peer or
      server to force a PAC re-key, and take advantage of the potential
      MitM/dictionary attack vulnerability of the EAP-FAST Server-
      Unauthenticated Provisioning Mode.

   Another consideration is the use of secure mechanisms afforded by the
   particular device.  For instance, some laptops enable secure key
   storage through a special chip.  It would be worthwhile for
   implementations to explore the use of such a mechanism.

6.9.  Security Claims

   The [RFC3748] security claims for EAP-FAST are given in Section 7.8
   of [RFC4851].  When using anonymous provisioning mode there is a
   greater risk of offline dictionary attack since it is possible for a
   man-in-the-middle to capture the beginning of the inner MSCHAPv2
   conversation.  However as noted previously it is possible to detect
   the man-in-the-middle.
