Abstract

   A limitation of Shim6 is that it only works with IPv6.  With 6to4, it
   is possible for hosts that only have IPv4 connectivity to still enjoy
   Shim6's multihoming benefits.

Internet-Draft               Shim6 with 6to4                   July 2009


1.  Introduction

   There are two problems with extending Shim6 ([RFC5533]) to use IPv4.
   The first one is that there are insufficient IPv4 addresses to
   provide hosts with multiple IPv4 addresses as a matter of course.
   The second problem is that the HBA security mechanism [RFC5535] needs
   a 64-bit interface identifier, which obviously isn't available with
   IPv4.

   This document outlines how to use 6to4 tunneling ([RFC3056]) to make
   Shim6 available to hosts that only have IPv4 connectivity, or more
   generally, that have 6to4 IPv6 connectivity.  The use of 6to4
   resolves the HBA issue while maintaining the ability for every
   locator to be an identifier.  Because multiple hosts can share the
   6to4 connectivity provided by a single address (per ISP), it also
   somewhat addresses the IPv4 address scarcity issue.  A downside of
   using 6to4 is that hosts must still be able to function as IPv6
   hosts; IPv4-only hosts and/or IPv4-only applications can't use Shim6
   over 6to4.

   6to4 can be useful as a means to provide multihoming for IPv6 hosts
   that only have a single non-6to4 IPv6 address, as well as a mechanism
   that may be able work around ingress filtering issues in some cases.
   Note that it is equally possible that native IPv6 connectivity on the
   one hand and IPv4 connectivity and 6to4 IPv6 connectivity on the
   other hand share or not share single points of failure.  A single
   point of failure common to all protocols will exist if a site only
   has a single connection to the internet.


2.  Basic operation

   Basic operation is for a Shim6 host to generate HBA interface
   identifiers based on all the available IPv6 addresses, including any
   6to4 addresses, and initiate and/or respond to Shim6 negotiations as
   per [RFC5533].

   If the host has multiple instances of native IPv6 connectivity as
   well as 6to4 connectivity, it may either only publish two or more
   non-6to4 addresses in the DNS, or publish both types of addresses.
   By not publishing 6to4 addresses the situation where hosts that don't
   implement [RFC3484] connect across the public 6to4 gateways
   unnecessarily is avoided.  (This can be from a non-6to4 address to a
   6to4 address or the other way around.)  The [RFC3484] policy table
   ensures that hosts implementing it prefer to connect in the following
   order: non-6to4 to non-6to4, 6to4 to 6to4, non-6to4 to 6to4.
   (However, IPv4 may be preferred either before or after non-6to4 to
   6to4.)  On the other hand, by publishing the 6to4 addresses in the

   DNS, a client has more opportunities to successfully connect to a
   server when there are connectivity problems.

   When Shim6 is negotiated, the 6to4 addresses are exchanged as usual,
   and when the primary address pair (the "identifiers") stop working,
   the 6to4 addresses will be tested by the REAP protocol ([RFC5534])
   and subsequently used if they work.


3.  Possible enhancements

   The following enhancements may allow for successful operation in a
   larger number of cases, or may improve performance.

3.1.  Source address dependent routing

   In the situation where a host receives router advertisements
   containing different prefixes from different routers, the likelihood
   of packets successfully leaving the site can be increased by sending
   packets with a source address in the prefix advertised by a certain
   router to that router, and not to another router.  (Assuming that
   both routers are valid default gateways and there are no more
   specific routes in the local routing table.)

   In the case where two or more routers advertise 6to4 subprefixes
   derived from different IPv4 addresses, sending packets towards the
   "correct" router has two advantages:

   1.  If the 6to4 router or a 6to4 gateway performs 6to4 sanity
       checking, it may reject packets with 6to4 source addresses that
       don't match the IPv4 source address in the outer header of the
       packet.  With source address dependent routing this situation is
       avoided.

   2.  If one of the routers can't successfully transmit packets, for
       instance, because there is a problem in the IPv4 network between
       the 6to4 router and the 6to4 gateway or the remote 6to4 router,
       using source address dependent routing will select a different
       outgoing router when using a different source address.  Without
       source address dependent routing, the host could use the router
       with broken connectivity exclusively and hence be unreachable.

   Source address dependent routing is a general purpose mechanism that
   can also be helpful with non-6to4 connectivity.  It can also be
   applied if multiple addresses are configured manually, by matching a
   source address to a default gateway address.  If multiple DHCPv6-
   derived addresses are present on the same interface, prefixes in
   router advertisements must be used to correlate the addresses with a

   router, as DHCPv6 doesn't provide the information necessary for this.
   With DHCPv6 on multiple interfaces the interface provides the
   correlation.

   If a host performs 6to4 tunneling locally, the source address
   dependent routing must extend to both the 6to4 tunneling (so that the
   IPv4 source address in the outer header matches the 6to4 IPv6 source
   address in the inner header) and IPv4 routing.  Because IPv4 DHCP
   provides both an address and a default gateway address, there is no
   issue having multiple DHCP-derived IPv4 addresses on the same
   interface with regard to source address dependent routing, although
   typically, DHCP clients will not obtain multiple addresses on the
   same interface.

3.2.  REAP address pair test order

   Although specific instances can easily be different, in general
   native IPv6 to native IPv6 or native IPv4 to native IPv4 are faster
   than native IPv6 to IPv6 tunneled over IPv4.  This is especially true
   of 6to4, where often public gateways are used that are not
   geographically close to either the source or destination.  Also, 6to4
   packets are filtered or misrouted more often than native IPv6
   packets.  This problem doesn't exist in the case where the two hosts
   communicating both use 6to4.  However, in that case, there is
   additional encapsulation overhead compared to the native IPv6 case.
   As such, the REAP protocol should test address pairs in the following
   order:

   1.  Native IPv6 to native IPv6

   2.  6to4 to 6to4

   3.  Native IPv6 to 6to4 (or the other way around)

3.3.  Tunnel optimization

   In the future, the Shim6 protocol may be extended to negotiate the
   ability to leave out the inner IPv6 header.  I.e., only the IPv4
   header and the Shim6 context tag would be present in data packets.
   However, the implications of such an optimization haven't been
   explored at this time.


4.  IANA considerations

   None.

5.  Security considerations

   The security considerations are those relevant to 6to4 as noted in
   [RFC3056] itself as well as in the separate 6to4 security
   considerations document [RFC3964], the anycasting of public 6to4
   gateways [RFC3068] and those relevant to Shim6: [RFC5533], [RFC5534]
   and [RFC5535].
