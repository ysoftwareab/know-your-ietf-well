                    Abstract 
                        
                       This document describes a framework that allows end-
                       users/applications to inform each other and negotiate about the QoS 
                       characteristics of the media components in a session, prior to its 
                       establishment. The QoS negotiation is modeled after the existing 
                       codec negotiation and as such becomes an integral part of the 
                       existing SDPng Offer/Answer model. The QoS information is exchanged 
                       at session set-up time using two new types of SDPng extensions 
                       between the end-users sites. Apart from the end hosts also some

                                     SDPng extensions for QoS negotiation   September 2002 
                       authorized intermediate proxies controlling the session set-up MAY 
                       participate to the QoS negotiation. 
                        
                       Secondly this document proposes SDPng extensions which allow the 
                       end-user to request an ordered list of preferred QoS levels per 
                       media stream during the QoS negotiation. The first type of 
                       extensions, called TI (Traffic Information), characterizes the 
                       traffic type of the bearer associated with the media stream. TI is 
                       typically related to bandwidth and packet size. The second type of 
                       extensions, called SI (Sensitivity Information), characterizes the 
                       sensitivity level of the service requested by the end-user with 
                       respect to the QoS information carried in the first type of SDPng 
                       extensions. SI is typically related to delay, jitter and packet 
                       loss.

                    2. Introduction 
                        
                       There is a whole range of applications that requires a phase of 
                       session/application level signaling before setting up network-layer 
                       resources/QoS. Examples are Internet telephony calls, multimedia 
                       conferencing (e.g. created via SIP), broadcast scenarios (e.g. 
                       announced via SAP), streaming applications (e.g. controlled via 
                       RTSP), etc. Typically the application level signaling messages used 
                       to create or modify those types of sessions carry session 
                       descriptions, which allow participants to exchange end-system 
                       capabilities and agree on a set of compatible media types. The 
                       session description, commonly formatted in SDP [2] or in the future 
                       in SDPng [6], is a well-defined format for conveying sufficient 
                       information to discover and participate in the session. 
                        
                       Some applications (e.g. Internet phone calls, ad-hoc multiparty 
                       conferencing) require a dynamic exchange of the session description 
                       to allow participants to exchange end-system capabilities and 
                       negotiate/agree on a set of compatible media types. Other 
                       applications (e.g. loosely coupled conferences or broadcast 
                       scenarios) don't require a negotiation phase. For example via SAP a 
                       previously created (and typically fixed) session description can be 
                       disseminated to a potentially large audience. Only the interested 
                       members of the audience that support all the parameters specified by 
                       the session description contained in SAP, will join the announced 
                       session. 
                        
                       The same SDPng QoS extensions can be used both for applications that 
                       require negotiation (e.g. SIP, BICC) or dissemination (e.g. SAP, 
                       RTSP) of the session description. As the dissemination case can be 
                       seen as a simplified one-way negotiation, the rest of this document 
                       will focus on the SDPng QoS negotiation procedure. The SIP protocol 
                       is used as example. 
                        
                       Although SIP [1] and SDP [2] offer an attractive set of mechanisms 
                       for multimedia session control and description, several IETF drafts 
                       have already shown the need for extensions to these protocols, 
                       especially for provisioning end-to-end Quality of Service for high-
                       quality IP telephony and multimedia services. In essence these 
                       recent proposals have recognized the need to enhance the co-
                       ordination between the session signaling layer, which controls 
                       access to multimedia specific services, and the resource management 
                       layer, which controls access to network resources.  
                        
                       [4] describes SIP extensions for media authorization for correlating 
                       the resources authorized by the session signaling architecture with

                                     SDPng extensions for QoS negotiation   September 2002 
                       the actual network resources requested by the UA for the media 
                       components. Manyfolks [3] describes SDP extensions that allow end-
                       users to check before continuing with the session set-up if 
                       establishing network QoS or security associations was successful for 
                       the individual media streams. 
                        
                       But the manyfolks SDP extensions/preconditions don't allow 
                       expressing which level of network QoS is required. Currently simply 
                       no mechanism exists to specify at session control level per media 
                       stream the QoS requirements that reflect the true end-user 
                       expectations.   
                        
                       Since the purpose of the SDP[2]/SDPng[6] protocol is to carry the 
                       actual session and media stream description, extensions to this 
                       protocol seem the natural way to carry this QoS information. In this 
                       way all applications using the SDPng session description (e.g. SIP, 
                       BICC, SAP, RTSP, MEGACO, ‡) can benefit from the same QoS 
                       extensions. The need to add QoS information to SDPng has already 
                       been recognized in the SDPng requirements draft [4] and the SDPng 
                       draft on requirements for session description and capability 
                       negotiation [5]. 
                        
                       This document makes a specific proposal for those additional QoS 
                       information fields in SDPng. However for backward compatibility with 
                       the current SDP version and timely market introduction of the 
                       proposed QoS extensions together with the manyfolks extensions, the 
                       authors believe that similar QoS extensions to SDP would be most 
                       useful. 
                        
                       The final goal of the true and-to-end QoS provisioning architecture 
                       is to deliver the end-user for each media stream a QoS that 
                       corresponds exactly to the level of "Quality" he wishes to 
                       experience. Currently however we are still far from this goal. 
                       Network operators or service providers may want their SIP proxies to 
                       be able to "screen" SIP/SDP messages (e.g. to enforce local QoS 
                       policy control or to check the user's QoS subscription profile). But 
                       unfortunately the QoS the user really wants can not be derived 
                       accurately from the codec and the optional b parameter in SDP. Even 
                       if SIP proxies of local access/service provider force themselves in 
                       the SIP signaling path (e.g. Record Route), today they can not fully 
                       control the QoS requirements associated with all session set-ups. 
                       This because some media simply are not associated with a codec (e.g. 
                       white board) or are associated with a codec the proxy doesn∆t know 
                       (e.g. new applications). Since today end-users can not 
                       negotiate/reach a QoS agreement at session set-up, there is no way 
                       to ensure that in both access networks the end-users will initiate a 
                       bearer set-up request with the same QoS. Therefore it is impossible 
                       for service providers to deliver "predictable end-to-end QoS" to 
                       their customers. And thus they can not really charge for QoS today. 
                       All these problems are solved with the proposed solution of QoS 
                       negotiation via SDPng extensions. 
                        
                       Service providers ideally would like to sell QoS packages (e.g. 
                       Gold/Silver quality). Before starting to watch a movie for example,

                                     SDPng extensions for QoS negotiation   September 2002 
                       an end-user may want to choose between different qualities and 
                       prices. The business model for long distance calls is already 
                       proven. Some telephony networks already offer users the choice 
                       between the traditional phone connection and the IP-based one, where 
                       the latter is cheaper but of worse quality. It is reasonable to 
                       assume that users may also be willing to pay for a differentiation 
                       in quality based on other parameters like destination 
                       (business/private call), expected duration of the session, etc. 
                       Service providers might also want to adapt the QoS based on other 
                       parameters (e.g. time of day/week, busy/non busy hour, destination, 
                       service settings). The proposed solution even creates further room 
                       for differentiation between service providers by allowing them to 
                       define their own QoS levels/packages. 
                          
                       The proposal enables end-users to express to the network and to 
                       negotiate with each other the "Quality" they find acceptable for 
                       each media stream of the requested multimedia session. It also 
                       provides a way for the network to check at session control level 
                       whether the QoS levels acceptable to both end-users are compliant 
                       with e.g. the users' subscription profile, service settings, 
                       policies in the local access,... . 
                        
                       It is important to understand also that this document does not 
                       describe a way to use SIP/SDPng messages for QoS provisioning. The 
                       SDPng QoS negotiation occurs independently of and prior to the QoS 
                       provisioning itself (e.g. RSVP [8], MPLS [10]).  
                        
                       This document is organized as follows. Section 3 provides a 
                       definition list. Section 4 introduces the two new types of SDPng 
                       extensions. Section 5 explains the QoS negotiation procedure and 
                       gives some examples scenarios. Section 6 covers the security 
                       considerations. Section 7 wraps up with the conclusions highlighting 
                       the main advantages of the proposed approach. 
                        
                    3. Terminology 
                     
                       The following is a list of terms used with a specific meaning in 
                       this document. 
                     
                       - Local access provider: entity locally providing the end-user 
                       access to the network 
                        
                       - Service provider: entity offering services to end-users 
                        
                       - Subscription: commercial agreement specifying the characteristics 
                       of service delivery between the service provider and the customer, 
                       possibly including QoS information 
                        
                       - Service settings: service specific information that can be set to  
                         different values by service provider 
                        
                       - Interface: reference point between two session signaling elements 
                        
                       - Roaming: possibility to get access to the network via different

                         local access providers 
                        
                       - Session level: session signaling level in the protocol stack,  
                         controlling access to applications/services (e.g. SIP) 
                        
                       - Transport level: resource management level in the protocol stack,  
                         controlling access to network resources (e.g. RSVP) 
                        
                       This document also uses the following terminology as defined in [1]: 
                       User Agent Client (UAC), User Agent Server (UAS), User Agent (UA), 
                       Session, call, Offer/Answer model, Offer/Counter-offer/Answer model. 
                        
                    4. QoS information to be carried in SDPng 
                        
                       The goal is that the QoS information carried in SDPng reflects 
                       exactly the "Quality" level "as the end-user wants to perceive it". 
                       In order to ensure a maximum of flexibility, it SHALL be possible to 
                       negotiate the QoS for each media stream of a given multimedia 
                       session.  
                        
                       Two types of SDPng extensions are needed during the QoS negotiation; 
                       TI (Traffic Information) and SI (Sensitivity Information).  
                                           
                       With each codec corresponds one TI level. The end-user (or some 
                       default settings or application running on the end-user terminal) 
                       SHOULD be able to specify per media stream and per codec an ordered 
                       set of acceptable SI QoS levels. Per codec/TI a list of SI levels is 
                       possible. The set of acceptable SI values are listed in decreasing 
                       order of preference in SDPng. This allows for prioritization during 
                       negotiation. 
                        
                       Although there is only one QoS negotiation per SIP transaction for 
                       both send and receive directions, the QoS requirements itself can be 
                       different in the send and receive directions. 
                        
                    4.1. First SDPng extension: TI (Traffic Information) 
                        
                       The first SDPng QoS extensions, called TI (Traffic Information), 
                       define the traffic type of the bearer associated with the media 
                       stream. The parameters characterizing TI are peak bit rate, 
                       sustainable bit rate, maximum packet size and maximum burst size.  
                       TI carries the QoS information that in normal situations can be more 
                       or less derived from the codec. However there are cases where some 
                       media streams are not associated with codecs (e.g. white board) or 
                       cases where the intermediate session control entities do not 
                       recognize the codec being used (e.g. use of new codecs).  
                       Carrying TI explicitly in SDPng still provides intermediate session 
                       control entities (e.g. SIP proxies) knowledge/control on the bearer 
                       requirement of the session being established. It relieves the 
                       requirement for all involved session control elements to know the 
                       mapping from a codec to the transport level requirement (TI) of this 
                       codec. This facilitates the introduction of new codec types.

                                     SDPng extensions for QoS negotiation   September 2002 
                       TI is always represented in SDPng under the form of parameters with 
                       their respective values: 
                        
                       o   peak bit rate 
                       o   sustainable bit rate  
                       o   maximum packet size 
                       o   maximum burst size 
                        
                    4.2. Second SDPng extension: SI (Sensitivity Information) 
                     
                       The second SDPng QoS extensions, called SI (Sensitivity 
                       Information), define the sensitivity of the service with respect to 
                       the QoS information carried in TI. The parameters characterizing SI 
                       are maximum end-to-end delay, maximum end-to-end delay variation and 
                       maximum packet loss ratio. For a certain bearer defined by TI, SI 
                       unambiguously determines the quality "as the end-user wants to 
                       perceive it", SI allows making the differentiation between low, 
                       media, high quality.  
                        
                       Three different formats that can be used to represent SI in SDPng: 
                        
                       - QoS Parameters format: 
                         A standardized set of well-known parameters unambiguously 
                         describing the sensitivity (SI) requirement for a particular codec 
                         corresponding with TI for a given media stream in a session. 
                          
                         The SI QoS parameters are: 
                         o maximum end-to-end delay  
                         o maximum end-to-end delay variation 
                         o maximum packet loss ratio 
                        
                       - QoS Class format: 
                         A standardized abbreviation for the SI QoS parameter format. 
                         Knowing the codec, a QoS class can be directly and unambiguously  
                         translated to a predefined set of SI QoS parameters with well-  
                         defined values. An example QoS class for audio for PCM codec  
                         (G.711) could be "TIPHON PSTN type voice quality". QoS class  
                         values MUST be defined by an internationally recognized standards  
                         body. 
                        
                       - QoS Flavour format: 
                         A standardized way of sending specific non-standard information  
                         describing SI for particular TI/codec. The QoS Flavour format is  
                         used in cases where two involved session control peer elements  
                         would like to exchange non-standard  (e.g. service/provider  
                         specific) QoS information. The usage of the QoS Flavour is always  
                         assuming a pre-defined and well-understood interpretation of the  
                         QoS information sent over the considered interface. Therefore, the  
                         list of possible QoS Flavour values that may be exchanged on a    
                         given interface has to be previously defined by a common agreement  
                         between the involved parties. Examples of the QoS Flavour format  
                         are Gold/Silver/Bronze quality, Low/Medium/High quality,...

                       A session control element can use different formats to represent the 
                       same SI information depending on which other session control element 
                       it is interfacing with. For example, a service provider can use the 
                       QoS Flavour form on the interface with the end-user and use a 
                       standardized form (QoS parameters or QoS Class) on the interface 
                       with a network operator. The service provider is assumed to perform 
                       the translation between the different representation forms.  
                        
                     4.3. Encoding of QoS extensions in SDPng 
                        
                       The QoS extensions are encoded in SDPng using <option>, as was 
                       already suggested in the last example of section 3.1.2 in [6]. This 
                       section shows, for each of the three different formats explained in 
                       section 4.2, how the SDPng QoS extensions could be incorporated in 
                       that example.

                       one acceptable codec "AVP-audio-0". But with this one codec there 
                       are two acceptable QoS levels, specified in parameter format

                    5. QoS negotiation procedure 
                        
                       The purpose of this section is to explain the QoS negotiation 
                       procedure and to provide some example scenarios. The general 
                       principles behind the QoS negotiation procedure are described in 
                       section 5.1. Section 5.2 explains that the QoS negotiation is 
                       modelled after existing SDPng codec negotiation and shows how it 
                       becomes an integral part of the SDPng Offer/Answer or Offer/Counter-
                       Offer/Answer model. Section 5.3 provides example QoS negotiation 
                       scenarios. 
                        
                    5.1. Principles of the QoS negotiation procedure 
                        
                       Allowing end-users to choose/agree upon a different QoS for the same 
                       type of communication (e.g. audio call) on a per session basis, 
                       requires QoS (TI and SI) to be negotiable between end-users at the 
                       session signaling level.  
                                            
                       All parties executing control on the session signaling (i.e. end-
                       user, service provider executing service control and local access 
                       network executing policy control) SHALL be able to participate in 
                       the QoS negotiation process. This is to ensure that the QoS 
                       negotiation results in a set of TI and SI values that have been 
                       agreed truly end-to-end at session level so that subsequently at the 
                       transport level QoS provisioning can be started based on end-to-end 
                       QoS agreement.  
                        
                    5.2. Offer/Answer versus Offer/Counter-Offer/Answer model for QoS 
                    negotiation 
                        
                       This draft refers to [1] for the definition of the roles played by 
                       participants in SIP communications. This document also refers to [3] 
                       for the definition of certain SIP extensions (e.g. SIP 183-session-
                       progress). Using this terminology, a simple SIP transaction can be 
                       modeled as a communication between a UAC and a UAS. A UAC is a 
                       logical entity initiating the SIP transaction with a request (e.g. 
                       SIP INVITE) and a UAS is a logical entity that responds to a SIP 
                       request (e.g. SIP 200-OK or SIP 183-session-progress), generally 
                       acting on behalf of some user. 
                        
                    5.2.1. Current SDP codec negotiation 
                        
                       As described in [7], SDP negotiation within SIP follows an "offer-
                       answer" model. One side (offerer) offers an SDP that provides its 
                       own view of the session, and the other side (answerer) answers the 
                       SDP with a matching one. The offer can be differentiated in sending 
                       and receiving directions by marking media streams as send-only or 
                       receive-only. If no marking is present the default is both send and 
                       receive. According to [7] SDP negotiation may occur in two ways, 
                       which are referred to as Offer/Answer versus Offer/Counter-
                       Offer/Answer model:   
                                           
                       - Offer/Answer model   
                         The offerer offers an SDP. The answerer is only allowed to reject

                         or to restrict the offer. In the latter case, the answer contains  
                         an SDP that is a sub-set of the original SDP proposed by the   
                         offerer (the number of "m=" lines remains the same). In the common  
                         example of codec negotiation, the UAC offers the list of codecs  
                         the UAC is willing to use in the SDP of the SIP INVITE. UAS  
                         answers with an SDP in the SIP 200-OK (or SIP 183-session- 
                         progress) containing only that subset of the original list of  
                         codecs that the UAS is willing to use. 
                                                
                       - Offer/Counter-Offer/Answer model   
                         The offerer offers an SDP. The answerer makes a Counter-Offer with  
                         additional elements or capabilities not listed in the original SDP  
                         offer. The Counter-Offer contains an SDP that may be a super-set    
                         of the original SDP proposed by the offerer (even when the number  
                         of "m=" lines remains the same). In the common example of codec  
                         negotiation, the UAS answers with an SDP in the SIP 200-OK (or  
                         SIP-183-session-progress) containing additional codecs, not listed   
                         in the SDP of the SIP INVITE received from the UAC.   
                                           
                       In both cases, the final result of the codec negotiation is a list 
                       of codecs for a given media stream; any of those codecs can be 
                       freely used during the session without sending a SIP message.  
                        
                    5.2.2. Proposed SDPng QoS negotiation 
                        
                       The QoS negotiation is modelled after the existing codec negotiation 
                       and as such becomes an integral part of the existing SDPng 
                       Offer/Answer or Offer/Counter-Offer/Answer model. The offerer 
                       determines per media stream a set of acceptable QoS levels, 
                       expressed in SDPng per media component and per codec/TI as an 
                       ordered set SI values. The list of acceptable SI QoS values, called 
                       "Requested QoS", is carried in the SDPng offer in one of three 
                       formats (QoS Parameter, QoS Class or QoS Flavour) and in decreasing 
                       order of preference, to allow prioritization during negotiation.

                       it. The SDPng answer contains a "Negotiated QoS", that is a sub-set

                       accepts to support all the QoS values originally proposed by the 
                       UAC. The UAS MUST list the "Negotiated QoS" levels in the same 
                       relative order they were present in the "Requested QoS" to guarantee 
                       that the same QoS level is used by both User Agents.    
                        
                       In the Offer/Counter-Offer/Answer model (see bottom of Figure 1) the 
                       answerer MAY extend the "Requested QoS" with additional QoS levels 
                       not listed in the original "Requested QoS". In this case, the 
                       Counter-Offer contains an "Extended QoS", that MAY be a super-set of 
                       the original "Requested QoS" proposed by the offerer. The offerer 
                       selects a subset "Negotiated QoS" of the "Extended QoS" and sends 
                       this "Negotiated QoS" back to the answerer.   
                                           
                       In both cases, the final result of the QoS negotiation is the 
                       "Negotiated QoS"; a decreasing ordered list of QoS (TI and SI) 
                       values per media stream retained for the session. Any of those 
                       negotiated TI/SI combinations can be freely used during the session 
                       without sending a SIP message.

                       A simple example (Figure 2) is direct UAC to UAS communication 
                       according to the QoS Offer-Answer model. The "Requested QoS" is 
                       carried in the SIP INVITE, the "Negotiated QoS" in the SIP 200-OK or 
                       SIP 183-session-progress.

                       According to [1], SIP requests can be sent directly from a UAC to a 
                       UAS or they can traverse one or more proxy servers along the way. 
                       Also from [1] we learn that a proxy can indicate that it wants to 
                       remain in the request path via a Record-Route header field. [1] also

                       states that proxies MAY modify any part of the SIP message - 
                       including the SDP - that are not integrity-protected, except those 
                       needed to identify call legs. 
                        
                       The above statements, quoted from [1], have the following 
                       implications on the QoS Offer/Answer model. Firstly the simple UAC-
                       UAS model (Figure 2) does not suffice. One or more proxy servers, 
                       possibly operated by different providers, MAY be in the signaling 
                       path between UAC and UAS (Figure 3). Some proxies (e.g. proxy in 
                       local access network executing policy control and proxy operated by 
                       the user∆s Internet service provider executing service control) MAY 
                       Record-Route themselves, so that they can screen the SDPng QoS 
                       negotiation, and MAY decide to modify the QoS being negotiated.

                       Figure 3 shows the impact of intermediate proxies on the Offer-
                       Answer model. Proxies MAY modify the "Requested QoS" received from 
                       the UAC to a "Modified QoS" based on different criteria. Such 
                       criteria could include information regarding subscription profile of 
                       the user, specific service settings, time of day/week or any other 
                       local network policies. Of course the UAS may also perform a final 
                       restriction on the set of QoS values resulting in the "Negotiated 
                       QoS".   
                                           
                       Thus, the "Negotiated QoS" will equal the "Requested QoS" only if 
                       the "Requested QoS" was compliant with the subscriber 
                       profile/service settings, not conflicting with local network 
                       policies and acceptable to the UAS.  
                                           
                       In the Offer-Answer model proxies are only allowed to make 
                       modifications in the sense of restrictions. The only exception is 
                       when the UAC does not include a "Requested QoS" in the SIP INVITE 
                       message. In this case a SIP proxy in the end-user∆s service provider 
                       domain MAY propose a "Modified QoS" itself. If the UAC does not 
                       specify a "Requested QoS" in the session set up, the "Modified QoS" 
                       MAY be deduced by the user∆s service provider either implicitly from 
                       access information about the UAC (terminal capabilities,

                       applications in terminal, access type, etc.), or from subscription 
                       or service information (the user∆s service provider can propose 
                       subscription packages with different levels of QoS for the different 
                       media streams involved in a communication service).   
                        
                    5.3. Relationship with transport level QoS provisioning 
                        
                       On the response path (Figure 3) the "Negotiated QoS" is distributed 
                       (in a SIP 200-0K or SIP 183-session-progress) to all involved 
                       session control elements between UAS and UAC side. At this point, 
                       proxies in the local access networks MAY use this "Negotiated QoS" 
                       information to inform the transport layer about the QoS/resources 
                       that have been authorized by the session layer for each media stream 
                       of the multimedia session. This topic is however not the subject of 
                       this document. [4] Already describes SIP extensions for media 
                       authorization which enable this correlation between the resources 
                       authorized by the call/session signaling architecture and the actual 
                       network resources requested by the UA at resource reservation/QoS 
                       provisioning.   
                              
                       It is important to understand also that this document does not 
                       describe a way to use SIP/SDPng messages for QoS provisioning. The 
                       SDPng QoS negotiation occurs independently of and prior to the QoS 
                       provisioning itself. Since in an IP network session signaling (e.g. 
                       SIP/SDP) usually follows another route than the data path, a 
                       proposal to integrate them indeed would make no sense. During the 
                       SDPng QoS negotiation step end-users simply agree on the QoS they 
                       would prefer but no resource reservation /QoS provisioning is 
                       carried out yet for that particular session. The proposed SDPng QoS 
                       extensions are a way to make sure that existing QoS provisioning 
                       mechanisms (e.g. RSVP, DiffServ, MPLS) receive correct and complete 
                       input, enabling them to reserve the resources with a QoS that 
                       matches exactly the end-user expectations.  
                        
                       After all parties (end-user, local access network, service provider) 
                       involved in the session signaling have agreed upon the QoS, 
                       appropriate QoS has to be provisioned in the network to deliver this 
                       QoS. Therefore UAC and UAS need to be able to translate the final TI 
                       and SI values negotiated at session/service level into the correct 
                       transport level QoS parameters, in order to trigger the 
                       corresponding QoS provisioning mechanisms (e.g. RSVP, DiffServ).   
                        
                    5.4. QoS preconditions - Coupling with manyfolks 
                        
                       Manyfolks [3] defined the "qos" attribute SDP extension, that 
                       indicates whether end-to-end resource reservation is optional or 
                       mandatory, and in which direction (send, recv, or sendrecv). The 
                       assumption is that similar extensions will also exist in SDPng.  
                        
                       An end-user should be able to specify for each media stream whether 
                       the successful establishment of a bearer "with a specific QoS" is 
                       required. This is enabled by co-ordinating the simultaneous usage of 
                       the mandatory or optional SDPng manyfolks extensions with the SDPng 
                       QoS extensions defined in this document.

                                     SDPng extensions for QoS negotiation   September 2002 
                                           
                       According to manyfolks [3] in case resource reservation is required 
                       as a precondition before proceeding with the session, it is 
                       necessary to replace the SIP 200-OK in Figure 2 by a SIP 183-
                       session-progress and the SIP ACK by a SIP PRACK. When the "qos" 
                       attribute indicates mandatory, this means that the participant who 
                       has received the session description does not proceed session setup 
                       until resource reservation has been completed in the specified 
                       direction.  
                        
                       This document extends manyfolks [3] in the following way. If the 
                       "qos" attribute is set to mandatory, the SDPng QoS extensions allow 
                       participants to indicate that resources need to be reserved end-to-
                       end, not only in which direction, but also WITH WHICH QUALITY OF 
                       SERVICE. Namely, with a Quality of Service compliant with the set of 
                       acceptable QoS values carried in the SDPng QoS extensions. If the 
                       "qos" attribute is set to optional, the SDPng QoS extensions allow 
                       participants to indicate with which Quality of Service resources 
                       should be reserved, but only if possible, that is without blocking 
                       the session set up process. If for mandatory media an end-user does 
                       not want best effort quality, the end-user should not indicate best 
                       effort as an acceptable QoS level. For optional media, best effort 
                       quality is implicitly assumed to be acceptable.  
                        
                    5.5. Scenario examples 
                        
                    5.5.1. Example 1: Simple UAC-UAS scenario 
                        
                       Suppose again the simple case (Figure 2) of direct UAC to UAS 
                       communication according to the QoS Offer-Answer model. Suppose the 
                       UAC specifies a "Requested QoS" containing acceptable QoS levels A, 
                       B and C for audio and D and E for video (highest preference for A 
                       respectively D).  
                        
                       Upon evaluation of the preference list of QoS values in the 
                       "Requested QoS", the UAS restricts the "Requested QoS" to only those 
                       QoS values that he is willing to use for this particular session. 
                       Suppose that the "Negotiated QoS" retains QoS levels A and B for 
                       audio and QoS level E for video. This means that the UAS is not 
                       willing to support the lowest QoS level C for audio nor the highest 
                       QoS level D for video.  
                        
                       Suppose the UAC had specified in the SDPng offer that reservation of 
                       resources for the audio component (with acceptable QoS levels A, B 
                       and C) was optional in the receiving direction whereas reservation 
                       of resources for the video component (with acceptable QoS levels D 
                       and E) was mandatory also in the receiving direction. This 
                       effectively means that the UAC only wishes to continue with the 
                       session if the UAS agrees and succeeds to reserve resources towards 
                       UAC for the video with a Quality of Service not lower than E and not 
                       higher than D.   
                                           
                       Making resource reservation for the audio component optional means 
                       that the UAC would like a Quality of Service level between A and C

                       but it will accept the media stream in the worst case even with no 
                       QoS guarantees (best effort).   
                                           
                       As the "Negotiated QoS" in this example contains the QoS level E for 
                       the video the UAC would accept the session. Suppose UAS rejected all 
                       A,B and C for the audio component ("Negotiated QoS" does not contain 
                       any QoS values for the audio component), the UAC would still accept 
                       the session even with best effort quality of service for the audio.  
                        
                    5.5.2. Example 2: UAC-Proxy Server-UAS scenario 
                        
                       Suppose again the case (Figure 3) with intermediate proxy/proxies 
                       between UAC and UAS. This example illustrates the use of the three 
                       possible formats that can be used to express the SI requirements 
                       (QoS Parameters, QoS Class, QoS Flavour). Suppose the UAC uses in 
                       the SIP INVITE the "QoS flavour" format hereby indicating to the 
                       proxy of the service provider for example that both "Gold" and 
                       "Silver" are acceptable for the voice component. "Gold" and "Silver" 
                       can be commercial names for QoS packages, the correct interpretation 
                       of which are only known to the end-user and its Service Provider 
                       (e.g. defined in a subscription).   
                                           
                       Suppose for this example that the proxy of the service provider 
                       decides, after checking several criteria (e.g. local network 
                       policies, subscription profile of the end-user, service 
                       settings,...) that only "Silver" can be retained. Before forwarding 
                       this information to the UAS the service provider will have to 
                       perform the correct translation from the non-standard "QoS Flavour" 
                       representation form into one of the standard formats "QoS Class" or 
                       "QoS Parameters".   
                                           
                       Since the usage of the QoS Flavour format always assumes a pre-
                       defined and well-understood interpretation of the QoS information 
                       sent over the considered interface, the proxy of the service 
                       provider unambiguously knows this mapping. "Silver" is mapped to the 
                       correct set of corresponding "QoS parameters" which are then sent to 
                       the UAS.   
                                           
                       A typical example where the proxy of the service provider could 
                       decide to use the "QoS class" occurs when there is a need to cross 
                       another proxy operated by a different provider (e.g. local access 
                       network where UAS is roaming) before reaching the UAS. There is no 
                       specific motivation to choose the "QoS class" instead of the "QoS 
                       parameters" format besides the fact that the former is a 
                       standardized abbreviated way to convey the same information.  
                        
                    6. Security considerations 
                        
                       The security considerations for ongoing SDPng specification work 
                       also apply to the SDPng QoS extensions proposed in this document. If 
                       the contents of the SDPng are private then end-to-end encryption of 
                       the message body can be used to prevent unauthorized access to the 
                       content.

                                     SDPng extensions for QoS negotiation   September 2002 
                    7. Conclusions 
                        
                       This document described a framework to negotiate end-to-end the 
                       "Quality" of a multimedia session "as the end-user wants to perceive 
                       it". This QoS negotiation is achieved at session signaling. All 
                       authorized session control elements, user agents as well as proxies, 
                       controlling the multimedia session set-up may participate to the QoS 
                       negotiation. Secondly this document proposed two new types of SDPng 
                       extensions that allow expressing the QoS level per media stream 
                       during the QoS negotiation. The first type of SDPng extensions 
                       characterize the traffic type of the bearer associated with the 
                       media stream, the second type of SDPng extensions characterize the 
                       sensitivity level of the service requested by the end-user with 
                       respect to the QoS information carried in the first type of SDPng 
                       extensions.  
                                           
                       To conclude we summarize the main advantages of the proposed 
                       approach. 
                        
                       - The SDPng QoS negotiation model can be used in combination with  
                         several application protocols (SIP, RTSP, Megaco, BICC,...). It  
                         works for roaming as well as non-roaming scenarios.  
                        
                       - From a customer point of view, the mechanism enables end-users to  
                         negotiate/agree upon QoS at session set-up. The end-user QoS  
                         preferences can be specified flexibly as a prioritized list of  
                         acceptable QoS levels per media stream. Coupling with the  
                         manyfolks SDP extensions enables end-users to make successful  
                         establishment of a bearer "with a specific QoS" a precondition for  
                         session set-up. All this allows end-users to control QoS and thus  
                         their expenses more flexibly. 
                        
                       - From the provider point of view, via the participation of proxies  
                         in the QoS negotiation, he keeps in control (policy and service  
                         control) over the QoS allocated to a certain user, also for media  
                         associated with a new codec or with no codec at all (e.g.  
                         whiteboard). Having the QoS to be set-up at the transport level  
                         first "approved" at session level by end-users, service provider  
                         and local access provider enables service providers to deliver a  
                         "predictable" QoS level to its customers. This means QoS becomes  
                         something a service provider can sell. New attractive subscription  
                         packages can be designed with a prize based on different QoS  
                         levels reflecting the true "Quality" as experienced by the end- 
                         user. Allowing non-standard service provider specific QoS info to  
                         be carried in SDPng creates new opportunities for differentiation     
                         between service providers as they can all start designing their  
                         own QoS Flavours (e.g. Gold/Silver/Bronze service). Finally  
                         enabling providers to make more intelligent decisions on QoS  
                         provisioning allows improvement of network scalability.
