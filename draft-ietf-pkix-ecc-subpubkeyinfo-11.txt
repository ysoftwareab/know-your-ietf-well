1. Introduction 

   This document specifies the format of the subjectPublicKeyInfo field 
   in X.509 certificates [PKI] that use Elliptic Curve Cryptography 
   (ECC).  It updates RFC 3279 [PKI-ALG]. This document specifies the 
   encoding formats for public keys used with the following ECC 
   algorithms: 

      o Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA); 

      o Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) family schemes; and 

      o Elliptic Curve Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (ECMQV) family schemes. 

   Two methods for specifying the algorithms that can be used with the 
   subjectPublicKey are defined.  One method does not restrict the 
   algorithms the key can be used with while the other method does 
   restrict the algorithms the key can be used with.  To promote 
   interoperability, this document indicates which is required to 
   implement for Certification Authorities (CAs) that implement ECC 
   algorithms and relying parties that claim to process ECC algorithms. 

   The ASN.1 module in this document includes ASN.1 for ECC algorithms.  
   It also includes ASN.1 for non-ECC algorithms defined in [PKI-ALG] 
   and [PKI-ADALG] even though the associated text is unaffected.  By

   updating all of the ASN.1 from [PKI-ALG] in this document, 
   implementers only need to use the module found in this document. 

1.1. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [MUSTSHOULD]. 

2. Subject Public Key Information Fields 

   In the X.509 certificate, the subjectPublicKeyInfo field has the 
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo type, which has the following ASN.1 syntax: 

     SubjectPublicKeyInfo  ::=  SEQUENCE  { 
       algorithm         AlgorithmIdentifier, 
       subjectPublicKey  BIT STRING 
     } 

   The fields in SubjectPublicKeyInfo have the following meanings: 

      o algorithm is the algorithm identifier and parameters for the 
        ECC public key. 

      o subjectPublicKey is the ECC public key.  See Section 2.2. 

   The AlgorithmIdentifier type, which is included for convenience 
   [PKI], is defined as follows: 

      AlgorithmIdentifier  ::=  SEQUENCE  { 
        algorithm   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, 
        parameters  ANY DEFINED BY algorithm OPTIONAL 
      } 

   The fields in AlgorithmIdentifier have the following meanings: 

      o algorithm identifies the cryptographic algorithm with an object 
        identifier.  See Section 2.1. 

      o parameters, which are optional, are the associated parameters 
        for the algorithm identifier in the algorithm field.  See 
        Section 2.1.1.

2.1. Elliptic Curve Cryptography Public Key Algorithm Identifiers 

   The algorithm field in the SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure [PKI] 
   indicates the algorithm and any associated parameters for the ECC 
   public key (see Section 2.2).  Three algorithm identifiers are 
   defined in this document: 

      o id-ecPublicKey indicates that the algorithms that can be used 
        with the subject public key is unrestricted.   The key is only 
        restricted by the values indicated in the key usage certificate 
        extension (see Section 3).  id-ecPublicKey MUST be supported.  
        See Section 2.1.1.  This value is also included in certificates 
        when a public key is used with ECDSA. 

      o id-ecDH indicates that the algorithm that can be used with the 
        subject public key is restricted to the Elliptic Curve Diffie-
        Hellman algorithm.  See Section 2.1.2.  id-ecDH MAY be 
        supported. 

      o id-ecMQV indicates that the algorithm that can be used with the 
        subject public key is restricted to the Elliptic Curve Menezes-
        Qu-Vanstone key agreement algorithm.  See Section 2.1.2.    id-
        ecMQV MAY be supported. 

2.1.1. Unrestricted Algorithm Identifier and Parameters 

   The "unrestricted" algorithm identifier is: 

     id-ecPublicKey OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 
       iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) ansi-X9-62(10045) keyType(2) 1 } 

   The public key (ECPoint) syntax is described in Section 2.2. 

   The parameter for id-ecPublicKey is as follows and MUST always be 
   present: 

     ECParameters ::= CHOICE { 
       namedCurve         OBJECT IDENTIFIER 
       -- implicitCurve   NULL 
       -- specifiedCurve  SpecifiedECDomain 
     } 
       -- implicitCurve and specifiedCurve MUST NOT be used in PKIX. 
       -- Details for SpecifiedECDomain can be found in [X9.62]. 
       -- Any future additions to this CHOICE should be coordinated 
       -- with ANSI X9.

Internet-Draft     ECC SubjectPublicKeyInfo Format        November 2008 
    

   The fields in ECParameters have the following meanings: 

      o namedCurve identifies all the required values for a particular 
        set of elliptic curve domain parameters to be represented by an 
        object identifier.  This choice MUST be supported. See Section 
        2.1.1.1. 

      o implicitCurve allows the elliptic curve domain parameters to be 
        inherited.  This choice MUST NOT be used. 

      o specifiedCurve, which is of type SpecifiedECDomain type 
        (defined in [X9.62]), allows all of the elliptic curve domain 
        parameters to be explicitly specified.  This choice MUST NOT be 
        used.  See the ASN.1 Considerations section. 

   The addition of any new choices in ECParameters needs to be 
   coordinated with ANSI X9. 

   The AlgorithmIdentifier within subjectPublicKeyInfo is the only place 
   within a certificate where the elliptic curve domain parameters may 
   be located.  If the elliptic curve domain parameters are not present, 
   then clients MUST reject the certificate. 

2.1.1.1. Named Curve 

   The namedCurve field in ECParameters uses object identifiers to name 
   well known curves.  This document publishes curve identifiers for the 
   fifteen NIST recommended curves [FIPS186-3].  Other documents can 
   publish other name curve identifiers.  The NIST named curves are: 

     -- Note that in [X9.62] the curves are referred to as 'ansiX9' as 
     -- opposed to 'sec'. For example secp192r1 is the same curve as 
     -- ansix9p192r1. 

     -- Note that in [PKI-ALG] the secp192r1 curve was referred to as 
     -- prime192v1 and the secp256r1 curve was referred to as 
     -- prime256v1.   

     -- Note that [FIPS186-3] refers to secp192r1 as P-192, secp224r1 as 
     -- P-224, secp256r1 as P-256, secp384r1 as P-384, and secp521r1 as 
     -- P-521. 

     secp192r1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 
       iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) ansi-X9-62(10045) curves(3) 
       prime(1) 1 }

     sect163k1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {

     sect163r2 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 
       iso(1) identified-organization(3) certicom(132) curve(0) 15 } 

     secp224r1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {  
       iso(1) identified-organization(3) certicom(132) curve(0) 33 } 

     sect233k1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {  
       iso(1) identified-organization(3) certicom(132) curve(0) 26 } 

     sect233r1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {  
       iso(1) identified-organization(3) certicom(132) curve(0) 27 } 

     secp256r1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {

       prime(1) 7 }

     sect283r1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {  
       iso(1) identified-organization(3) certicom(132) curve(0) 17 } 

     secp384r1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {  
       iso(1) identified-organization(3) certicom(132) curve(0) 34 } 

     sect409k1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {  
       iso(1) identified-organization(3) certicom(132) curve(0) 36 } 

     sect409r1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {  
       iso(1) identified-organization(3) certicom(132) curve(0) 37 } 

     secp521r1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {  
       iso(1) identified-organization(3) certicom(132) curve(0) 35 } 

     sect571k1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {  
       iso(1) identified-organization(3) certicom(132) curve(0) 38 } 

     sect571r1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {  
       iso(1) identified-organization(3) certicom(132) curve(0) 39 } 

2.1.2. Restricted Algorithm Identifiers and Parameters 

   Two "restricted" algorithms are defined for key agreement algorithms: 
   the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement family schemes 
 
 
Turner, et al           Expires June 11, 2009                  [Page 6] 

Internet-Draft     ECC SubjectPublicKeyInfo Format        November 2008 
    

   and the Elliptic Curve Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (ECMQV) key agreement 
   family schemes. Both algorithms are identified by an object 
   identifier and have parameters.  The object identifier varies based 
   on the algorithm but the parameters are always ECParameters and they 
   MUST always be present (see Section 2.1.1). 

   The ECDH algorithm uses the following object identifier: 

     id-ecDH OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 
       iso(1) identified-organization(3) certicom(132) schemes(1) 
       ecdh(12) }  

   The ECMQV algorithm uses the following object identifier: 

     id-ecMQV OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 
       iso(1) identified-organization(3) certicom(132) schemes(1) 
       ecmqv(13) }  

2.2. Subject Public Key 

   The subjectPublicKey from SubjectPublicKeyInfo is the ECC public key.  
   ECC public keys have the following syntax: 

     ECPoint ::= OCTET STRING 

   Implementations of elliptic curve cryptography according to this 
   document MUST support the uncompressed form and MAY support the 
   compressed form of the ECC public key.  The hybrid form of the ECC 
   public key from [X9.62] MUST NOT be used.  As specified in [SEC1]: 

      o The elliptic curve public key (a value of type ECPoint which is 
        an OCTET STRING) is mapped to a subjectPublicKey (a value of 
        type BIT STRING) as follows: the most significant bit of the 
        OCTET STRING value becomes the most significant bit of the BIT 
        STRING value, and so on; the least significant bit of the OCTET 
        STRING becomes the least significant bit of the BIT STRING.  
        Conversion routines are found in Sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 of 
        [SEC1]. 

      o The first octet of the OCTET STRING indicates whether the key 
        is compressed or uncompressed.  The uncompressed form is 
        indicated by 0x04 and the compressed form is indicated by 
        either 0x02 or 0x03 (see 2.3.3 in [SEC1]).  The public key MUST 
        be rejected if any other value is included in the first octet.

3. Key Usage Bits 

   If the keyUsage extension is present in a Certification Authority 
   (CA) certificate that indicates id-ecPublicKey in 
   subjectPublicKeyInfo, then any combination of the following values 
   MAY be present: 

     digitalSignature; 
     nonRepudiation; 
     keyAgreement; 
     keyCertSign; and 
     cRLSign. 

   If the CA certificate keyUsage extension asserts keyAgreement, then 
   it MAY assert either encipherOnly or decipherOnly.  However, this 
   specification RECOMMENDS that if keyCertSign or cRLSign is present, 
   then keyAgreement, encipherOnly, and decipherOnly SHOULD NOT be 
   present. 

   If the keyUsage extension is present in an End Entity (EE) 
   certificate that indicates id-ecPublicKey in subjectPublicKeyInfo, 
   then any combination of the following values MAY be present: 

     digitalSignature; 
     nonRepudiation; and 
     keyAgreement. 

   If the EE certificate keyUsage extension asserts keyAgreement, then 
   it MAY assert either encipherOnly or decipherOnly. 

   If the keyUsage extension is present in a certificate that indicates 
   id-ecDH or id-ecMQV in subjectPublicKeyInfo, then the following MUST 
   be present: 

     keyAgreement; 

   one of the following MAY be present: 

     encipherOnly; or 
     decipherOnly. 

   If the keyUsage extension is present in a certificate that indicates 
   id-ecDH or id-ecMQV in subjectPublicKeyInfo, then the following 
   values MUST NOT be present: 

     digitalSignature; 
     nonRepudiation;

     keyTransport; 
     keyCertSign; and 
     cRLSign. 

4. Security Considerations 

   The security considerations in [PKI-ALG] apply. 

   When implementing ECC in X.509 Certificates and Certificate 
   Revocation Lists (CRLs), there are three algorithm related choices 
   that need to be made for the signatureAlgorithm field in a 
   Certificate: 

   1) What is the public key size? 

   2) What is the hash algorithm [FIPS180-3]? 

   3) What is the curve? 

   Consideration must be given by the CA to the strength of the security 
   provided by each of these choices.  Security is measured in bits, 
   where a strong symmetric cipher with a key of X bits is said to 
   provide X bits of security.  It is recommended that the bits of 
   security provided by each choice are roughly equivalent.  The 
   following table provides comparable minimum bits of security [SP800-
   57] for the ECDSA key sizes and message digest algorithms.  It also 
   lists curves (see Section 2.1.1.1) for the key sizes.

   Using a larger hash value and then truncating it, consumes more 
   processing power than is necessary.  This is more important on

   constrained devices.  Since the signer does not know the environment 
   that the recipient will use to validate the signature, it is better 
   to use a hash function that provides the desired hash value output 
   size, and no more. 

   There are security risks with using keys not associated with well 
   known and widely reviewed curves. For example, the curve may not 
   satisfy the Menezes-Okamoto-Vanstone (MOV) condition [X9.62] or the 
   curve may be vulnerable to the Anomalous attack [X9.62]. 
   Additionally, either a) all of the arithmetic properties of a 
   candidate ECC public key must be validated to ensure that it has the 
   unique correct representation in the correct (additive) subgroup (and 
   therefore is also in the correct EC group) specified by the 
   associated ECC domain parameters or b) some of the arithmetic 
   properties of a candidate ECC public key must be validated to ensure 
   that it is in the correct group (but not necessarily the correct 
   subgroup) specified by the associated ECC domain parameters [SP800-
   56A]. 

   As noted in [PKI-ALG], the use of MD2 and MD5 for new applications is 
   discouraged.  It is still reasonable to use MD2 and MD5 to verify 
   existing signatures. 

5. ASN.1 Considerations 

   [X9.62] defines additional options for ECParameters and ECDSA-Sig-
   Value [PKI-ALG].   If an implementation needs to use these options, 
   then use the [X9.62] ASN.1 module. This RFC contains a conformant 
   subset of the ASN.1 module defined in [X9.62]. 

   If an implementation generates a PER [X.691] encoding using the ASN.1 
   module found in this specification, it might not achieve the same 
   encoded output as one that uses the [X9.62] module.  PER is not 
   required by either the PKIX or S/MIME environments.  If an 
   implementation environment requires PER, then implementation concerns 
   are less likely with the use of the [X9.62] module. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   This document makes extensive use of object identifiers to register 
   public key types, elliptic curves, and algorithms. Most are 
   registered in the ANSI X9.62 arc with the exception of the hash 
   algorithms, which are in NIST arc, and many of the curves, which are 
   in the Certicom Inc. arc (these curves have been adopted by ANSI and 
   NIST). Additionally, an object identifier is used to identify the 
   ASN.1 module found in Appendix A. It is defined in an arc delegated
