Abstract

   TPA-SSP (DKIM Third-Party Authorization for Sender Signing Practices)
   is a DNS-based label prefix mechanism to provide a means to authorize
   Third-Party signing domains in a scalable fashion.  This mechanism
   eliminates complex coordination of selector/key DNS records, DNS zone
   delegation, or exchanges of public/private keys otherwise required to
   facilitate desired authorizations.  Checking Sender Signing Practices
   occurs in common cases where an originating email-address of concern
   is not within a DKIM signing domain.  In which case, the email-

Internet-Draft                   TPA-SSP                       June 2007


1.  Introduction

   This document describes how any email-address domain publishing SSP
   records defined in [I-D.ietf-dkim-ssp] can authorize [RFC4871]
   signing by third-party domains.  Recommended or suggested actions for
   a DKIM receiver are not included, and are considered "out-of-scope"
   for this document.  The receiver is assumed to better understand
   their environment's impact upon the performance of DKIM signatures
   and how DKIM signatures are utilized within their domain.

   There are many uncertainties in respect to the actual usage of the
   DKIM protocol.  These uncertainties exist due to:
   o  Intentionally vague DKIM protocol semantics
   o  Full adoption of DKIM is not implied
   o  Limited semantics for some signing domains
   o  Optional validity of email-addresses
   o  No assumed signature ordering or signing roles
   o  No direct association with the SMTP Client

   The purpose of the TPA-SSP is to permit domains that are not at or
   above the email-address domain to comply with Sender Signing
   Practices.  TPA-SSP authorized domains are to be considered
   equivalent to a signing domain at or above the email-address with
   respect to the application of Sender Signing Practices.  This
   mechanism eliminates complex coordination of selector/key DNS
   records, DNS delegation, or exchange of public/private keys otherwise
   required to facilitate the desired authorization.

   Rather than traversing domains searching for possible SSP records,
   the validity of a non-existent Policy record can be confirmed by the
   presence of DNS records needed to discover SMTP servers.  This
   implies policy records must be coincident with all such DNS discovery
   records.  For this reason, use of A records for discovering SMTP
   servers should be deprecated.

   A message signed with DKIM, whether or not there is also a policy
   that can be referenced, does not indicate whether a message is from a
   good or bad actor.  However, DKIM signatures will allow a recipient's
   trust to be strengthened.  Good actors establish trust.  Bad actors
   do not.

   Trust is an essential requisite before DKIM signature header field's
   'i=' semantics or the TPA-SSP assertions provide valuable advisory
   information.  This advisory information permits the safer application
   of message annotations ensuring trusted identities are properly
   recognized.  Policy assertions convey which domains are authoritative
   and assure which identifiers might be considered valid.  This
   information is essential for proper recognition of email-addresses of

   trusted identities, as well as noting when a message source may
   require added scrutiny.


2.  Envelope Authorizations

   DKIM is fully independent of the SMTP Client and the
   [RFC2821].MailFrom email-address.  Allowing the [RFC2821].MailFrom
   email-address to designate signing domains and assert signing
   practices may prevent Delivery Status Notifications (DSNs) from being
   sent when the signing domain is not authorized.  Conversely, this may
   also ensure DSNs are not dropped when the signing domain is
   authorized.  Application at the MailFrom represents an entirely
   optional strategy that may or may not prove either effective or
   practical.  This is offered only for experimentation.


3.  The Signing Domain

   Unlike IPv4 addresses, there is virtually no limit on the number of
   domain-names available.  Registrar pricing of domain-names should
   remain uniform, otherwise higher fees based upon intrinsic value
   established by the owners could cause these owners to become
   extortion targets.  Initial costs for domain-names are also unlikely
   to represent a deterrent due to high levels of fraud.  While domain
   tasting allows registrars to avoid retracting a flood of fraudulent
   credit card transactions, this strategy also results in a daily churn
   of millions of domains being added and then withdrawn.

   In addition, DKIM can not directly identify the domain transmitting
   the message, and can not prevent abusive message replay.  Abusive
   message replay may prove indistinguishable from bulk mailings of
   various types.  As a result, message acceptance will likely remain
   based primarily upon the IP address of the SMTP Client.  Abuse
   reporting facilitated by a DKIM signature should therefore select
   those signing domains that correspond with the domain administering
   the SMTP Client that is publicly transmitting the message.  TPA-SSP
   provides a simple means to retain a relationship between the SMTP
   Client and the DKIM signing domain.

   When signing domains differ from that of the domain within the
   originating email-address, TPA-SSP offers a solution where only the
   actions of the email-address domain is required to retain email-
   address policy compliance.  In addition, just as a DKIM signature can
   assert an email-address is valid via the "i" construct, a signing
   domain that only signs validated email-addresses is denoted by the
   "strict" assertion within the TPA-SSP record.  When coupled with the
   TPA prefix, the "strict" assertion indicates that the domain plays



Otis                    Expires December 28, 2007               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                   TPA-SSP                       June 2007


   the role of assuring that email-addresses are valid.  This assertion
   remains valid even when signing domains and the email-address domains
   differ.

   Without the "strict" assertion within the TPA-SSP record, the domain
   is designated as providing only valid signatures in the same manner
   as would a DKIM signature lacking the "i" construct.  While this
   latter role of only offering valid signatures will not ensure all
   possible spoofing is prevented, these messages should not receive
   annotations indicating such assurances either.  This represents an
   economical alternative enabling large scale autonomous administration
   of email domains.  Authorizing domains to play the role of only
   providing valid signatures may be suitable for non-critical messages,
   where the goal could be to only improve delivery acceptance.

   Without the use of TPA-SSP, when the originating email-address domain
   differs from that of a provider's domain, additional steps must be
   taken by the third-party provider.  DNS delegation, DNS selector/key
   record mirroring, or key exchanges are required to permit the DKIM
   signing domains to be at or above the email-address domain.  This
   means the provider needs to sign with the customer's private key, or
   have their customer replicate the provider's public selector/key
   information within their DNS, or have their customers delegate a
   lower portion of their DNS zone to the provider.  In addition, a
   significant amount of detail is associated with selector/key records
   that might be then controlled by the provider, such as user
   limitations, suitable services, key resource record's Time-To-Live,
   revocation and update procedures, and whether the DKIM Signature
   header field's 'i=' semantics should be applied to indicate valid
   email-addresses.

   The DNS delegation effort will likely involve sharing details between
   the email provider, the domain owner, and the DNS provider.  As there
   are many ways in which this could be accomplished, it is also
   unlikely there will be consistent or standardized formats for
   exchanging this information.  In addition, when there are any
   security breaches, the wrong party might be held accountable for
   message content never seen or logged by them.  An authorization
   scheme clarifies who signed the message and on who's behalf.

   Protections offered by DKIM are largely related to the better
   recognition of prior correspondents, and improved identification of
   initial sources when instances of abuse are reported.  While TPA-SSP
   may allow receivers to detect and reject messages that appear non-
   compliant, the overall cases where this might happen is likely to
   represent a fairly small portion of overall messages.  When the
   receiver seeks to protect the DKIM verification process with a
   preliminary message filter, even acquiring TPA-SSP policy records or

   DKIM keys may inadvertently leak valuable information benefiting
   abusive senders.  The validation of DKIM and the obtaining of TPA-SSP
   resource records may consequently become limited to known trustworthy
   domains.


4.  TPA-SSP Assertions

   Syntax descriptions use the form described in Augmented BNF for
   Syntax Specifications [RFC4234].  The "base32" function is defined in
   [RFC4648] and the "sha-1" hash function is defined in
   [FIPS.180-2.2002].  Sender Signing Practices records follow the tag-
   value syntax described in section 3.2 of [RFC4871].  Tags used in SSP
   records are as follows.  Unrecognized tags and tags with illegal
   values MUST be ignored.  In the ABNF below, the FWS token is
   inherited from [RFC2822] with the exclusion of obs-FWS.  The ALPHA
   and DIGIT tokens are imported from [RFC4234].  The function "lcase"
   converts upper-case ALPHA characters to lower-case.  The terminating
   period is not included in domain-name conversions.

      asterisk = %x2A ; "*"
      hyphen = %x2D ; "-"
      period = %x2E ; "."
      colon = %x3A ; ":"
      semicolon = %x3B ; ";"
      equals = %x3D ; "="

      ldh = ALPHA / DIGIT / hyphen ;
      let-dig = ALPHA | DIGIT ;
      subdomain = let-dig [*61(ldh) let-dig] ;
      domain = subdomain 1*(period subdomain) ;

      ANY = asterisk period ; "*."
      FWS = ([*WSP CRLF] 1*WSP) ;

                                 TPA Scope

   The receiver obtains the TPA-SSP email-address domain policy using a
   DNS query for an IN class TXT resource record.  The character-strings
   contained within the TXT resource record are concatenated into
   forming a single string.  A character-string is a single length octet
   followed by that number of characters treated as binary information.
   A TPA-SSP policy record may be located at these domains:

      <tpa-label>._ssp._domainkeys.<email-address domain>.



5.  Scope

   s= Scope List(Optional).  This tag defines a list of scoping

      scope-list = %x73 [FWS]equals[FWS] scope 0*(*FWS colon *FWS scope)


5.1.  (F)rom header field

   The "F" Scope asserts that messages carrying the email-address domain
   within the From header field are authorized to be signed by the
   authorized domain.


5.2.  (M)ailFrom parameter

   This "M" Scope asserts that messages carrying the email-address
   domain within the MAILFROM parameter are authorized to be signed by
   the authorized domain.


5.3.  (O)riginating header fields

   The "O" Scope asserts that messages carrying the email-address domain
   within the Sender or Resent-* header fields are authorized to be
   signed by the authorized domain.



6.  Authorized Signing Domain

   a= Authorized Signing Domain list (Optional).  This tag repeats all
   or portions of the domain encoded within the tpa-label.  This option
   ensure proper handling of possible hash collisions.  When a domain is
   prefixed with the "*."  ANY label, then all subdomains of this domain
   are considered to be included in the list.

7.  IANA Considerations

   Unless a registry is established for SSP record tags, there are no
   IANA requirements in this draft.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC and no request is desired or registration is not considered

   practical.


8.  Security Considerations

   This draft extends signing policies related to [RFC4871].  Security
   considerations in the Sender Signing Practices are mostly related to
   attempts on the part of malicious senders to represent themselves as
   other senders, often in an attempt to defraud either the recipient or
   the Alleged Originator.  Additional security considerations regarding
   Sender Signing Practices may be found in the DKIM threat analysis
   [RFC4686].

   The use of the SHA-1 hash algorithm does not represent a security
   concern.  The hash simply ensures a deterministic domain-name size is
   achieved.  Unexpected collisions can be detected and handled by using
   the extended SSP "a=" option.
