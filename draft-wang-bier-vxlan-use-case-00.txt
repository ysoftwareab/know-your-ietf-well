Abstract

   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is an architecture that
   provides optimal multicast forwarding through a "BIER domain" without
   requiring intermediate routers to maintain any multicast related per-
   flow state.  BIER also does not require any explicit tree-building
   protocol for its operation.  A multicast data packet enters a BIER
   domain at a "Bit-Forwarding Ingress Router" (BFIR), and leaves the
   BIER domain at one or more "Bit-Forwarding Egress Routers" (BFERs).
   The BFIR router adds a BIER header to the packet.  The BIER header
   contains a bit-string in which each bit represents exactly one BFER
   to forward the packet to.  The set of BFERs to which the multicast
   packet needs to be forwarded is expressed by setting the bits that
   correspond to those routers in the BIER header.

   This document tries to describe the drawbacks of how BUM services are
   deployed in current data centers, and proposes how to take full
   advantage of BIER to implement BUM services in data centers.

1.  Introduction

   This document is motivated by [I-D.ietf-bier-use-cases].

   In current data center virtualization, virtual eXtensible Local Area
   Network (VXLAN) [RFC7348] is a kind of network virtualization overlay
   technology which is overlaid between NVEs and is intended for multi-
   tenancy data center networks, whose reference architecture is
   illustrated as per Figure 1.

   And there are two kinds of most common methods about how to forward
   BUM packets in this virtualization overlay network.  One is using PIM
   as underlay multicast routing protocol to build explicit multicast
   distribution tree, such as PIM-SM[RFC4601] or PIM-BIDIR
   [RFC5015]multicast routing protocol.  Then, when BUM packets arrive
   at NVE, it requires NVE to have a mapping between the VXLAN Virtual
   Network Instances (VNI) and the IP multicast group.  According to the
   mapping, NVE can encapsulate BUM packets in a multicast packet which
   group address is the mapping IP multicast group address and steer
   them through explicit multicast distribution tree to the destination
   NVEs.  This method has two serious drawbacks.  It need the underlay
   network supports complicated multicast routing protocol and maintains
   multicast related per-flow state in every transit nodes.  What!_s
   more, how to configure the ratio of the mapping between VNI and IP
   multicast group is also an issue.  If the ratio is 1:1, there should
   be 16M multicast groups in the underlay network at maximum to map to
   the 16 M VNIs, which is really a significant challenge for the data
   center devices.  If the ratio is n:1, it would result in inefficiency

   bandwidth utilization which is not optimal in data center networks.

   The other method is using ingress replication to require each NVE to
   create a mapping between the VXLAN Virtual Network Instances (VNI)
   and the remote NVEs!_ addresses which belong to the same virtual
   network.  When NVE receives BUM traffic from the attached tenant, NVE
   can encapsulate these BUM packets in unicast packets and replicate
   them and tunnel them to different remote NVEs respectively.  Although
   this method can eliminate the burden of running multicast protocol in
   the underlay network, it has a significant disadvantage: large waste
   of bandwidth, especially in big-sized data center where there are
   many receivers.

   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture] is
   an architecture that provides optimal multicast forwarding through a
   "BIER domain" without requiring intermediate routers to maintain any
   multicast related per-flow state.  BIER also does not require any
   explicit tree-building protocol for its operation.  A multicast data
   packet enters a BIER domain at a "Bit-Forwarding Ingress Router"
   (BFIR), and leaves the BIER domain at one or more "Bit-Forwarding
   Egress Routers" (BFERs).  The BFIR router adds a BIER header to the
   packet.  The BIER header contains a bit-string in which each bit
   represents exactly one BFER to forward the packet to.  The set of
   BFERs to which the multicast packet needs to be forwarded is
   expressed by setting the bits that correspond to those routers in the
   BIER header.

   The following section tries to proposes how to take full advantage of
   BIER to implement BUM services in data centers.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The terms about BIER are defined in [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture].

   (The overall architecture of forwarding multicast using a Bit
   Position).

   NVE: Network Virtualization Edge, which is the entity that implements
   the overlay functionality.  An NVE resides at the boundary between a
   Tenant System and the overlay network.

   VXLAN: Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network

3.  BIER in data centers

   This section tries to describe how to use BIER as an optimal scheme
   to forward the broadcast, unknown and multicast (BUM) packets when
   they arrive at the NVE.

   The principle of using BIER to forward BUM traffic is that: it
   requires each NVE to have a mapping between the VXLAN Virtual Network
   Instances (VNI) and the bit-string in which each bit represents
   exactly one remote NVE to forward the packet to.  On other words,
   this requires the underlay network to support BIER which already be
   elaborated in [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture].

   Already mentioned above, BIER requires no explicit tree-building
   protocols and maintains no multicast related per-flow state on the
   end nodes and intermediate nodes, just extends the IGP protocol or
   BGP protocol to advertise BIER-specific information to form BIER
   forwarding table in the BIER forwarding routers, such as NVEs and
   intermediate nodes in the data centers.

   More importantly, as for how each NVE knows the other remote NVEs
   that belong to the same virtual network can also be discovered by
   additional BIER extensions.  The following sections describe how to
   extend IGP protocol and BGP protocol to advertise VXLAN-specific
   information to tell each NVE where the other NVEs are in the same
   virtual network.  As a result of this advertisement, each NVE creates
   the mapping between the VXLAN Virtual Network Instances (VNI) and the
   bit-string in which each bit represents exactly one remote NVE to
   forward the packet to.

4.  BIER IS-IS extension for VXLAN-specific information

   Specifically, in [I-D.ietf-bier-isis-extensions], there defines a new
   BIER Info sub-TLV which is illustrated in Figure 2.  Here, extending
   a VXLAN-specific sub-sub-TLV to current BIER Info sub-TLV for IS-IS,
   a reference format is illustrated in Figure 3.

   Then NVEs and intermediate nodes flood this VXLAN-specific sub-sub-
   TLV together with BIER Info sub-TLV through IS-IS in overlay network.
   When one NVE receives this IS-IS advertisement, this NVE builds a
   mapping between the receiving VNI in the VXLAN-specific sub-sub-TLV
   and the bit-string which represents the sending NVE and can extract

   from the BIER Info sub-TLV.  Once this NVE receives some other IS-IS
   advertisements which include the same VXLAN-specific sub-sub-TLV, it
   updates the bit-string in the mapping and adds the corresponding
   sending NVEs to the updated bit-string.

   After finishing the above IS-IS flooding, each NVE knows where are
   the remote NVEs in the same virtual network.  When receiving BUM
   traffic from the attached tenant, each NVE knows exactly how to
   forward this traffic to.

   This can be used in both IPv4 network and IPv6 network.

5.  BIER OSPF extension for VXLAN-specific information

   Specifically, in [I-D.ietf-bier-ospf-bier-extensions], there defines
   a new BIER Info sub-TLV as well.  Here, extending a VXLAN-specific
   sub-sub-TLV to current BIER Info sub-TLV for OSPF, a reference format
   is also illustrated in Figure 3.

   Then NVEs and intermediate nodes flood this VXLAN-specific sub-sub-
   TLV together with BIER Info sub-TLV through OSPF in overlay network.
   When one NVE receives this OSPF advertisement, this NVE builds a
   mapping between the receiving VNI in the VXLAN-specific sub-sub-TLV
   and the bit-string which represents the sending NVE and can extract
   from the BIER Info sub-TLV.  Once this NVE receives some other OSPF
   advertisements which include the same VXLAN-specific sub-sub-TLV, it
   updates the bit-string in the mapping and adds the corresponding
   sending NVEs to the updated bit-string.

   After finishing the above OSPF flooding, each NVE knows where are the
   remote NVEs in the same virtual network.  When receiving BUM traffic
   from the attached tenant, each NVE knows exactly how to forward this
   traffic to.

   This can be used in both IPv4 network and IPv6 network.

6.  BIER BGP extension for VXLAN-specific information

   Specifically, in [I-D.ietf-bier-idr-extensions], there defines a new
   BGP path attribute referred to as the BIER attribute.  Here,
   extending a VXLAN-specific sub-TLV to current BIER attribute TLV for
   BGP, a reference format is also illustrated in Figure 3.

   Then NVEs and intermediate nodes flood this VXLAN-specific sub-TLV
   together with BIER attribute TLV through BGP in overlay network.
   When one NVE receives this BGP attribute, this NVE builds a mapping
   between the receiving VNI in the VXLAN-specific sub-TLV and the bit-
   string which represents the sending NVE and can extract from the BIER
   attribute TLV.  Once this NVE receives some other BIER attribute TLV
   which include the same VXLAN-specific sub-TLV, it updates the bit-
   string in the mapping and adds the corresponding sending NVEs to the
   updated bit-string.

   After finishing the above BGP advertisement, each NVE knows where are
   the remote NVEs in the same virtual network.  When receiving BUM
   traffic from the attached tenant, each NVE knows exactly how to
   forward this traffic to.

   This can be used in both IPv4 network and IPv6 network.
