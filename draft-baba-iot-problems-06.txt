 Problems in and among industries for the prompt realization of IoT and
                         safety considerations

Abstract

   This document contains opinions gathered from enterprises engaging in
   the IoT business as stated in the preceding version hereof, and also
   examines the possibilities of new social problems in the IoT era.
   Recognition of the importance of information security has grown in
   step with the rising use of the Internet.  Closer examination reveals
   that the IoT era may see a new direct physical threat to users.  For
   instance, the situation at a smart house may lead it to judge that
   the owner has only temporarily stepped out, causing it to unlock the
   front door, which in turn makes it easier for thieves to enter.
   These kinds of scenarios may occur without identity fraud, hacking,
   and other means of compromising information security.  Therefore, for
   the purpose of this document, this issue shall be referred to as "IoT
   Safety" to distinguish it from Information Security.

   We believe that it is necessary to deepen our understanding of these
   new IoT-related threats through discussion and ensure there are
   measures to address these threats in the future.  At the same time,
   we must also coordinate these measures with the solutions to the
   problems described in the previous version of this document.

1.  Introduction

   Many activities are progressing in various fields, such as the
   proposal of standards for creating an IoT world.  There are also many
   reports that analyze and predict the benefits that IoT can bring to
   the economy and society.  These developments remind us of the end of
   the 20th century, when the effect and impact of the Internet was
   actively debated.

Internet-Draft                IoT Problems                 November 2018


   The authors tried using the following approach to clarify the issues
   for the prompt realization of IoT.  First, the players were
   conveniently divided into two groups: ICT industry players and Things
   industry players.  Next, we met major players in the ICT industry and
   Things industry and asked about the challenges they faced and the
   challenges the other side faced in creating IoT.

   The ICT industry players mentioned here include communication
   carriers, ICT equipment vendors, the Internet service providers,
   application vendors, and software houses.  The Things industry
   players include home and housing equipment manufacturers,
   infrastructure providers such as railways companies and power
   companies, and manufacturers of home appliances such as air
   conditioners and refrigerators, which are also the ICT users.

   This paper is principally a summary of the meetings results, and a
   presentation of the micro case studies about the challenges for
   realizing IoT services.  It is not an overview of the IoT world or a
   macro-proposal intended to promote the benefits of IoT.

   In addition, the revised version includes an examination of the
   possibilities of new direct physical threats in the IoT era that have
   not yet been seen.  These threats should affect the safety of our
   bodies, lives, and "things," which includes property.  For this
   reason, this issue shall be referred to as "IoT Safety" to
   distinguish it from Information Security for the purpose of this
   document.

   For the past few years, we got new findings through COMMA House, the
   experimental smart house owned by The University of Tokyo.
   Therefore, we will add new topics to the next version.

2.  Technical Challenges

2.1.  Safety, Security and Privacy

2.1.1.  Challenges in protecting lives and property from IoT-related
        threats (IoT Safety)

   The introduction of IoT may generate threats to "Safety" through the
   actual operation of mechanical devices, in addition to the
   Information Security problems discussed in Section 2.1.2 below.  For
   example, the spread of applications for visualizing electric power
   consumption allows for mischief in device operation without the use
   of identity fraud or hacking.  In addition, there is the potential
   for problems to arise in the normal operation of individual devices
   that are not caused by abnormal current or voltage, another troubling
   aspect of the introduction of IoT.  These issues cannot be resolved



Baba, et al.              Expires May 19, 2019                  [Page 4]

   with ordinary information security measures for Network Layer 4 or
   lower.  In another case, a command to an IoT device is proper by
   itself, but it may conflict with the other commands or its
   environmental status.  Therefore, the authors consider it necessary
   to have a system for interpreting the details of operations of many
   appliances and preventing operations according to the necessity in
   Layer 7 (what the authors tentatively call "Sekisyo".)

   These threats are categorized into three types: threat to physical
   safety; the threat of the failure or destruction of equipment and
   property; and the threat of impeding the proper performance of
   equipment.  The following section introduces examples of the
   different threats.

2.1.1.1.  Safety of body/life

   Information on things such as the use of faucets and housing
   equipment, the locking of the front doors and windows, and the state
   of electric power consumption based on the smart meter is used by
   smart houses to regulate homes.  This information is used to
   determine whether anyone is at home, and the electronic lock of the
   front door and windows is unlocked and a notice of absence is issued
   to a thief.

2.1.1.2.  Safety of equipment

   Air conditioners and other equipment that normally are not expected
   to be frequently started or stopped each a day can be caused to break
   down by repeatedly turning them on and off as many as hundreds of
   times a day.

2.1.1.3.  Proper performance of equipment

   Water heaters containing a hot well can be caused to operate
   erratically.  This is done by frequently transmitting signals from
   the mischief application instead of operation panel to tell the water
   heater that only 10% of the normal amount of hot water is needed,
   leaving the water heater perpetually low on water.

2.1.2.  Information Security

   We have confirmed two viewpoints regarding the information security
   of services using IoT equipment and devices.  The first is tangible
   information security involving the critical infrastructure.  The
   second concerns the information security of individuals and homes.

   In regards to information security involving the critical
   infrastructure, the basic policy in the past was to stay physically



Baba, et al.              Expires May 19, 2019                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                IoT Problems                 November 2018


   disconnected from an external network, such as the Internet, to
   ensure information security.  However, because of the advance in the
   systems from proprietary communication protocols to open IP protocols
   to detect symptoms of problems and to remotely maintain a large
   number of facilities spread over a wide area, connecting to an
   external network will become unavoidable to achieve various goals.
   In addition, it is clear that isolated networks are also subject to
   the same kind of risks, even though it is not directly connected to
   the outside.  There is no major difference in the information
   security risks because isolated networks are already the target of
   international cyber terrorism, with internal crimes and targeted
   attacks occurring more frequently.  Based on these reasons, the ICT
   security of the social infrastructure requires an extremely high
   level of information security.

   Looking at the information security of micro units, such as
   individuals and homes, the improved convenience provided by the
   introduction of IoT will lead to greater risks.  For example, there
   is a product available for connecting the entrance door to the
   network.  In ICT security technology, increasing the key length of
   the encryption makes it much harder to break.  But even if the latest
   information security technology is used when it is installed, the
   information security technology will become obsolete and even pose a
   risk about halfway through the twenty- to thirty-year lifetime of the
   entrance door.  As has been explained in other items, the ICT sense
   of time is completely different from that of Things.

2.1.3.  Privacy in acquiring data

   The problem of privacy in handling acquired data is a huge challenge
   for companies promoting IoT.  In addition, the ownership of this data
   poses yet another challenge.

   For example, railway companies have installed many cameras for
   station security and for marketing beverage vending machines.  This
   creates problems for personal identification and privacy.  At the
   present time, the companies are processing the images in real time
   and do not store the images to avoid the problems.

   Another huge challenge is the ownership of data.  Up until now, there
   has been a divided debate on whether data belonged to the company or
   to the users.  Likewise, the relationship inside a small user group
   is also extremely diverse and complicated.  One specific example is
   of a company that had obtained permission from the head of the
   household to use the data when it carried out an HEMS trial.  Later
   on, the spouse of the head of the household disagreed and as a result
   permission to use the data was withdrawn.

2.2.  Challenges posed by data acquisition, data distribution, data
      management and data quantity

2.2.1.  Traffic patterns

   The manner in which data is acquired from and distributed to IoT
   equipment/devices differs immensely from the traffic patterns of the
   present Internet.  The present form of the Internet focuses on
   distributing information, and its systems focus on effectively
   delivering contents to the users.  On the other hand, routinely or
   temporarily sending or receiving data through a huge number of
   various sensors and devices presents a very different kind of
   Internet traffic.  However, questions such as how much traffic will
   come from what kind of Things, and how will they superimpose each
   other have not been sufficiently studied.  There is no concrete
   explanation about the backbone design and operation of traffic, and
   there have been many cases in which the unclear specifications for
   IoT traffic made the design difficult on the communication company
   side.  There are many challenges related to the set up and management
   of IoT equipment.  We have heard from the construction companies that
   the configuration of IoT equipment with a large number of sensors
   involves a lot of hard work.

2.2.2.  Acquired mass data

   It is necessary to develop a management method to reuse acquired data
   safely and effectively.  Even now, there are occasional instances of
   the theft and leakage of social data (such as IDs) that can be used
   to identify individuals.  In the IoT era, there will be mass data
   that can lead to Things, and the Things in turn will lead to
   individuals.  There are IoT industry players who do not invest as
   much in ICT systems as government agencies and large companies do,
   and thus a management system to safely and effectively reuse the
   acquired data needs to be developed.  The laws and regulations
   related to ID management differ vastly by country and region.  These
   issues related to society and individuals are largely affected by
   differences in common sense, and therefore need to be localized.

2.2.3.  Explosive increase and diversity of data

   In the future IoT era, there are concerns about the explosive
   increase in data quantity and the diversity of data sent from sensors
   and IoT equipment.  On the other hand, M2M communication does not
   require mass data like images, and an extraordinary increase in
   traffic will be unlikely despite the increase in the number of
   sensors.

Internet-Draft                IoT Problems                 November 2018


   If data is sent from all Things, there will be an infinite number of
   different kinds of data.  In addition, with the present form of
   Internet traffic, data is received by people, and most of it consists
   of video or image downloads.  The download traffic is several times
   greater than that of the upload traffic.  If there is a tremendous
   increase in the use of IoT, such as M2M communication, the difference
   between upload and download traffic will probably not be that much.
   It might be necessary to fundamentally review the network and in
   particular the last mile characteristics.  The importance of this
   issue is not yet widely recognized.

2.3.  Mapping of the physical world and the virtual world

2.3.1.  Physically handling acquired data

   The acquired data simply represents certain kinds of digital value,
   and it is important to uncover the meaning of this data.  As
   described previously, configuration of IoT equipment, such as the
   large number of installed sensors, requires a lot of hard work.  An
   even greater amount of effort will be needed to determine the meaning
   of the data and connect it to the physical world.

   In energy management experiments, data is mapped manually.  This is a
   time consuming process, and one that is prone to human error.  Cases
   that rely on the use of human hands require the configuration of
   automated setting systems to reduce labor, costs, and human errors to
   introduce IoT

2.3.2.  Data calibration

   Another important thing is calibration.  This involves properly
   linking the data sent from Things to the Things concerned, and
   correctly indicating the operating conditions.

   It may be necessary to have a tool to treat this problem concerning
   continuation of operation and the one pertaining to introduction of
   IoT described previously as a package.

2.4.  Product lifetime, generation management, and the cost of equipment
      updates

2.4.1.  Product lifetime

   The life of most ICT equipment is about 5 years or less, while the
   life of IoT equipment and devices is at least 10 years.  There is a
   clear gap between these two types of equipment.

Internet-Draft                IoT Problems                 November 2018


   In the example of the entrance door connected to the network
   mentioned earlier, the door is often used for about twenty to thirty
   years after installed.  If is connected to a network, the
   communication technology and communication service will most likely
   have undergone numerous generation changes in that twenty- to thirty-
   year time span.  This presents a large gap between the ICT industry
   and the Things industry.

   A solution to this problem that was reached during the meeting with
   the housing equipment manufacturers is that with the automatic
   control of multiple shutters in a building, the portion between the
   controller and the multiple shutters, the so-called mature
   technology, can be placed under the control of the shutter
   manufacturers, while the controller connected to the network will
   deal with the generation changes of the communication service.

2.4.2.  Introducing IoT equipment into commodity equipment

   It costs a lot to make the many different types of commodity
   equipment popular around the world usable as IoT equipment and
   devices.  There are two ways to change commodity equipment into IoT
   equipment.  One way is to convert it to IoT compatible equipment.
   The other way involves adding devices to commodity equipment.  There
   are costs in both cases, and it will take a long time to introduce
   IoT unless different incentives are offered to help to overcome the
   burden of cost.

2.5.  Too many related standards and the speed of standardization

2.5.1.  Too many related standards

   There are many standards related to IoT equipment and devices.  There
   are multiple standards, technologies and services for communication
   technology, such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, NFC, and LTE, and it is
   difficult to choose which to apply.

   The Things industry players do not always have the communication
   technology professionals needed for IoT.  In the meeting, we learned
   that many companies were uncertain and hesitant about fields outside
   their own area of expertise.  On the other hand, technological
   competition will improve quality as well as the level of completion,
   and thus will be beneficial for users.

   In the future, a consulting business for clarifying ICT technology
   for the Things industry players may emerge.  If there is a system
   that can interconnect multiple standards, it will accelerate the
   Things industry to enter IoT

2.5.2.  Speed of standardization

   The concept of product life in ICT industry is completely different
   from that of the Things industry, and as a result the concept of
   standardization also varies greatly.  Before standardization occurs
   in the ICT industry, many different proposals are made, from which
   the best is selected.  The final decision often changes, and products
   have to be updated in order to follow the changes in standards.  But
   in the Things industry, the standards have to remain unchanged for as
   long as possible because of the long product lifetimes.  Therefore,
   it takes a long time to determine when a particular standard has
   become mature.  When the Things industry goes to implement a standard
   from the ICT industry, it feels that the standard is incredibly fluid
   and seemingly undecided.  Furthermore, the standardization process of
   the two industries is very different, and making it difficult to work
   on the other side when trying to determine a standard.

2.6.  Interoperability, fault isolation, and total quality assurance

2.6.1.  Interoperability

   The verification of interoperability poses a major challenge because
   of the configuration used by multi-vendors.  In addition to
   interoperability between equipment, the ability to ensure backward
   compatibility is also important for bringing about the IoT world.

   If these capabilities cannot be provided, it will be very difficult
   to create an IoT world in which past products can function.

2.6.2.  Fault isolation

   The method for fault isolation that may occur presents another
   challenge.

   Many PC users have experienced various kinds of problems.  When their
   PC experiences a problem, they have to isolate the faults by
   themselves, with no one available to lend a helping hand.

   In the IoT world, these issues become more difficult and complicated.
   For example, a smart home is equipped with air conditioners, kitchen
   supplies, and doors connected to the Internet.  A problem that occurs
   in the smart home poses a much more serious problem to end users than
   an e-mail failure or problem with a PC.

   If users are left to isolate the fault on their own, they may not
   know which manufacturer they contact for repairs if they are unable
   to isolate the fault on their own, or the manufacturer may refuse to
   perform repairs because they fall outside the scope of their

   responsibility.  As can be seen, the issue is an important challenge
   that will determine whether the B2C specific IoT world can be
   established.

2.6.3.  Quality assurance

   The quality assurance of individual pieces of IoT equipment does not
   guarantee the total quality of IoT.  Since IoT involves connecting
   multiple Things and communication, it is natural to assume that the
   total service quality will depend on the quality of the IoT equipment
   and devices, which can sometimes become bottleneck.  However, users
   are not aware of this.

   As was mentioned previously in Section 2.6 issues that are not
   directly related to the quality of an individual component can be
   important factors in determining the quality of the service.  In this
   way, the quality of IoT is not decided by each individual Thing, but
   needs to be considered as a service spread across the network.

2.7.  Product design policy

2.7.1.  Changes in design policy

   The design policy has to be changed from placing emphasis on the high
   functionality of a single product to stressing the singular function
   of individual products as well as how they work in coordination with
   other products.  For many years, the Things industry has focused on
   producing high functionality products with added value.  But in the
   IoT era, the implicit assumption is to confine Things to their basic
   function and enhance the level of coordination between Things, rather
   than focusing on the added value.  Simplified Things must be able to
   be controlled with an external application that can also be used by
   the Things of cross manufacturers.

   Given this situation, the Things industry faces the challenge of
   adopting a completely different policy.  During the meeting with the
   manufacturing industries, we could sense their difficulty in
   understanding and recognizing the need to change the policy.

2.8.  Various technology restrictions within actual usage

2.8.1.  Using radio waves

   There are many cases that have provided us with insight about issues
   related to the use of radio waves in IoT (such as the wave traveling
   range and whether or not it travels further than stated in
   assumptions available).  The suppliers or providers who configure IoT
   are not always wave communication technology experts.  People who are

Internet-Draft                IoT Problems                 November 2018


   unfamiliar with radio waves seem to think that waves travel from
   antenna to antenna in a straight line, and that they can be blocked
   by obstacles.  As a result, they often ask questions about how many
   meters radio waves can travel or whether radio waves can actually
   travel.  Few people understand the fact that the emitted radio waves
   are reflected from various locations and are superimposed at the
   reception point where they are received, or that depending on how
   waves are reflected a change in the reception signal intensity,
   called fading, may occur.  The lack of engineers who can advise on
   specialized matters such as these poses a major obstacle.

2.8.2.  Batteries

   The power capacity and lifetime of batteries represent another set of
   challenges similar in nature to the issue of radio waves traveling
   distance.  There are questions such as the difference between the
   real and catalog specifications, as well as factors that affect the
   battery power capacity.  The IoT providers, who are also users of
   IoT, have to solve these issues, while these are difficult problems
   even for experts.

2.8.3.  Wiring

   The incredible amount of wiring and its complexity (power lines and
   communication lines) pose major challenges.  The complexity of
   wiring- such as the large number of sensors and equipment, the power
   lines that drive them, and the communication lines that connect them
   to the network for acquiring information-is to the point that people
   doing IoT installation work will start wishing for a wire harness.
   In addition, the installation of cables and electric work are often
   done by different engineers.  This make the issue even more
   complicated.

2.8.4.  Being open

   A single company alone cannot make all the commodities for IoT.  The
   IoT world needs to be open, and this can only be achieved with the
   cooperation of many different industries.  Up until now, companies in
   the Things industry have developed products in a closed loop process,
   seeking to capture users with their company's own products.  For this
   reason, they lack an open design concept of interoperability.  Today,
   an entirely new design concept is needed to design products that can
   interconnect with the products of other companies.

3.  Non-technical Challenges

3.1.  Changing the product paradigm

3.1.1.  Ecosystems

   While the goal of setting up IoT is to generate new value, it may
   actually lead to the destruction of the ecosystems in which
   industries operate.  In the IoT era, the traditional vertically
   integrated way of producing Things in manufacturing industries will
   consume too much time and cost.  This approach also makes it
   difficult to incorporate the ideas of other cultures.  The need for
   paradigm shift is easy to understand, but difficult to implement.
   Promoting this shift will pose a management challenge that requires a
   considerable amount of skill and effort to overcome.

3.1.2.  Coordination and significant changes in strategy

   It will become necessary to run businesses jointly with new partners,
   as well as cooperate and work in coordination with other industries
   and competitors.  This issue-even when it is fully understood-will be
   very difficult to address and put into practice.

   We have seen instances in which only a limited amount of information
   was given when parties exchanged opinions.  There have also been
   instances in which communication was difficult because of differences
   in terminology and culture.

3.1.3.  Competition with existing industries

   The issue of competition with existing industries often arises when
   attempts are made to change or reform a business model change or
   reform.  This issue can also be viewed as the reorganization of
   industries, rather than competition between existing industries.
   However, this realignment of industries is difficult to move forward
   in the absence of supervisors.

3.2.  Benefits

3.2.1.  Rising costs and monetization

   Introducing IoT within products will cause costs to go up, and yet
   the benefits it provides are unclear.  There is no specific killer
   application available, and the number of users will not rise
   immediately.  Therefore, finding a way to make the business
   profitable will be very difficult.  This issue is especially
   difficult for businesses and products that rely on cost reductions to
   deliver low prices that make them competitive.

3.3.  Information security and privacy of social systems

3.3.1.  Classification of ownership, location, and the usage of data

   There are many questions regarding the wide variety of data gathered
   from IoT equipment, including questions related to ownership, storage
   location, and the authorization to grant a license to use data.
   These need to be addressed so that the system and equipment can be
   accepted by society.

   For example, if a company installs a door in a house that gathers
   data on the opening and closing of the door, questions about the data
   will arise.  Does it belong to the users or the company?  Can another
   company use this data?

3.4.  Disclosure of data

3.4.1.  Side effects and malicious use potentially caused by the
        disclosure of data

   For example, it has been shown that the electricity smart meter can
   lead to burglary because it shows when electricity is used and not
   used, providing an indication of the time when no one is home.  This
   particular example demonstrates the importance of ensuring
   information security and privacy.

3.5.  Preparing social support

3.5.1.  Regulations

   Systems of laws and regulations are important for ensuring the safety
   of the conventional products, but they can also be a barrier for
   innovation.

   IoT can be affected by laws and regulations at home and abroad, and
   can also be influenced by regulations that extend across multiple
   countries.  Regulatory authorities need to monitor IoT carefully and
   adjust the regulations and laws they oversee in a way that does not
   negatively impact the global competition environment.

3.5.2.  Corporate social responsibility

   In addition to pursuing profit, companies that promote IoT also need
   to improve the benefits offered to users and society

Internet-Draft                IoT Problems                 November 2018


3.5.3.  Customization for individual customers

   There is an ongoing shift in demand away from general products to
   customized products for individual customers.  This could also be
   viewed as a shift away from manufacturing businesses to service
   businesses.  IoT will play an important role in this shift.

   Instead of manufacturing Things through mass production, it will be
   easier to customize a product by moving some of the functions to an
   application.  Likewise, the manufacturing business also needs to move
   forward with the previously mentioned paradigm shift in order to
   achieve customization

3.5.4.  IoT literacy of the users

   Because Things are connected to the network, apps will need to be
   created.  Some of these will serve as the interface with which people
   interact with IoT.

   In the IoT era of the future, users will need to possess a certain
   amount of knowledge about IoT apps

3.5.5.  Individual vs. family

   The issue of whether the data of Things in the house belongs to the
   family or the individual will largely affect data analysis and the
   handling of privacy.

   As was mentioned in Section 2.1.2, the spouse could later object to
   the head of the household granting authorization to use data.

4.  Information Security Considerations

   Meetings with the players in various IoT fields provided insight into
   information security issues.  These issues are described in the
   following sections.

   o  Section 2.1.2 Physical damper of devices
