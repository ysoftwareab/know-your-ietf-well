Abstract

This memo discusses and defines terms associated with performance 
benchmarking tests and the results of these tests in the context of cell-
based and call-based switching devices.  The terms defined in this 
memo will be used in addition to terms defined in RFCs 1242, 1944 
and 2285.  This memo is a product of the Benchmarking Methodology 
Working Group (BMWG) of the Internet Engineering Task Force 
(IETF).

I.  Background

1.  Introduction.  This document provides terminology for 
benchmarking cell-based and call-based switching devices.  It extends 
terminology already defined for benchmarking network interconnect 
devices in RFCs 1242, 1944 and 2285 .  Although some of the 
definitions in this memo may be applicable to a broader group of 
network interconnect devices, the primary focus of the terminology in 
this memo is on cell-based and call-based switches.  Specifically, this 
includes Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) cell relay and signaling 
and Frame Relay (FR) signaling.

This memo contains two major sections: Background and Definitions.  
Within the definitions section is a formal definitions subsection, 
provided as a courtesy to the reader, and a measurement definitions 
sub-section, which contains performance metrics with inherent units.

The BMWG produces two major classes of documents: Benchmarking 
Terminology documents and Benchmarking Methodology documents. 
The Terminology documents present the benchmarks and other related 
terms. The Methodology documents define the procedures required to 
collect the benchmarks cited in the corresponding Terminology 
documents.

2.  Existing Definitions

RFC 1242 "Benchmarking Terminology for Network Interconnect 
Devices" should be consulted before attempting to make use of this 
document.  RFC 1944 "Benchmarking Methodology for Network 
Interconnect Devices" contains discussions of a number of terms 
relevant to the benchmarking of switching devices and should also be 
consulted.  RFC 2285 "Benchmarking Terminology for LAN 
Switching Devices" contains a number of terms pertaining to traffic 
distributions and datagram interarrival.  For the sake of clarity and 
continuity this RFC adopts the template for definitions set out in 
Section 2 of RFC 1242.  Definitions are indexed and grouped together 
in sections for ease of reference.  The key words "MUST", "MUST 
NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",  "SHOULD", 
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" 
in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

II.  Definitions

The definitions presented in this section have been divided into two 
groups.  The first group is formal definitions, which are required in the 
definitions of the performance metrics but are not themselves strictly 
metrics.  These definitions are subsumed from other work done in 
other working groups both inside and outside the IETF.  They are 
provided as a courtesy to the reader.

(cells/second) at which a source is allowed to send. 

Discussion:

Specification: AF-TM4.0

1.2.2.  ACR Decrease Time Factor (ADTF):

Definition:  This is the time permitted between sending RM-cells 
before the rate is decreased to ICR (Initial Cell Rate).  The time units 
are:
	 .01 to 10.23 seconds
with a granularity of 10 ms.

Discussion:

Specification: AF-TM4.0

1.2.3.  Additive Increase Rate (AIR):

Definition:  An ABR service parameter, AIR controls the rate at which 
the cell transmission rate increases.  It is signaled as AIRF, where 
	AIRF = AIR*Nrm/PCR.

Discussion:

Specification: AF-TM4.0

Definition:  Refer to AIR.

Discussion:

Specification: AF-TM4.0

1.2.5.  ATM Adaptation Layer (AAL):

Definition:  The layer in the B-ISDN reference model (see B-ISDN) 
which adapts higher layer PDUs into the ATM layer.  

Discussion:  There are 4 types of adaptation layers: 
- AAL1: used for circuit emulation, voice over ATM
- AAL2: used for sub-rated voice over ATM
- AAL3/4: used for data over noisy ATM lines
- AAL5: used for data over ATM, most widely used AAL type
These AAL types are not measurements, but it is possible to measure 
the time required for Segmentation and Reassembly (SAR).

Specification: AF-UNI3.1

1.2.6.  ATM Adaptation Layer Type 5 (AAL5):

Definition:  AAL5 functions in support of variable bit rate, delay-
tolerant data traffic requiring minimal sequencing or error detection 
support.

Discussion:  AAL5 is the adaptation layer for UNI signaling, ILMI, 
PNNI signaling, and for IP PDUËs.  It is the most widely used AAL 
type to date.  

Specification: AF-UNI3.1

1.2.7.  Available Bit Rate (ABR): 

Definition:  ABR is an ATM layer service category for which the 
limiting ATM layer transfer characteristics provided by the network 
may change subsequent to connection establishment.  A flow control 
mechanism is specified which supports several types of feedback to 
control the source rate in response to changing ATM layer transfer 
characteristics. 

Discussion:  It is expected that an end-system that adapts its traffic in 
accordance with the feedback will experience a low cell loss ratio and 
obtain a fair share of the available bandwidth according to a network 
specific allocation policy.  Cell delay variation is not controlled in this 
service, although admitted cells are not delayed unnecessarily.

Each field is discussed in the ATM Specific definition section of this 
document.

Specification:  AF-UNI3.1

1.2.23.  Congestion Indicator (CI): 

Definition:  This is a field in a RM-cell, and is used to cause the source

may be used to facilitate the calculation of ER, and may not be 
changed by network elements.  CCR is formatted as a rate.

Discussion:  

Specification: AF-TM4.0

1.2.28.  Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC): 

Definition:  A mathematical algorithm that computes a numerical value 
based on the bits in a block of data.  This number is transmitted with 
the data and the receiver uses this information and the same algorithm 
to insure the accurate delivery of data by comparing the results of 
algorithm and the number received.  If a mismatch occurs, an error in 
transmission is presumed.

Discussion:  CRC is not a measurement, but it is possible to measure 
the amount of time to perform a CRC on a string of bits.  This 
measurement will not be addressed in this document.

Specification:  AF-UNI3.1

1.2.30.  Explicit Forward Congestion Indication (EFCI):

Definition: EFCI is an indication in the PTI field of the ATM cell 
header.  A network element in an impending-congested state or a 
congested state may set EFCI so that this indication may be examined 
by the destination end-system.  For example, the end- system may use 
this indication to implement a protocol that adaptively lowers the cell 
rate of the connection during congestion or impending congestion.  A 
network element that is not in a congestion state or an impending 
congestion state will not modify the value of this indication. 
Impending congestion is the state when network equipment is 
operating around its engineered capacity level.

Discussion:  

Specification:  AF-TM4.0

1.2.31.  Explicit Rate (ER):

Definition: The Explicit Rate is a RM-cell field used to limit the source 
ACR to a specific value.  It is initially set by the source to a requested 
rate (such as PCR).  It may be subsequently reduced by any network 
element in the path to a value that the element can sustain.  ER is 
formatted as a rate.

Discussion:  

Specification:  AF-TM4.0

1.2.32.  End System (ES):

initiated. An originating end system initiates the ATM connection, and 
terminating end system terminates the ATM connection.  OAM cells 
may be generated and received.

Discussion:  An ES can be the user side of a UNI signaling interface.

Specification:  AF-TEST

1.2.33.  Generic Cell Rate Algorithm (GCRA):

Definition: The GCRA is used to define conformance with respect to 
the traffic contract of the connection.  For each cell arrival the GCRA 
determines whether the cell conforms to the traffic contract.  The UPC 
function may implement the GCRA, or one or more equivalent 
algorithms to enforce conformance.  The GCRA is defined with two 

Benchmarking Methodology Working Group	Page 10

INTERNET-DRAFT  Call/Cell Benchmarking Terminology October 1998

measurements that can be obtained using the GCRA and other 
parameters.

Specification:  AF-TM4.0

1.2.34.  Generic Flow Control (GFC):

AAL5 to provide ATM network devices with status and configuration 
information concerning VPCs, VCCs, registered ATM addresses and 
the capabilities of ATM interfaces.

Discussion:  ILMI is a conditionally required portion of UNI3.1; 
however, ILMI 4.0 has been issued as a separate specification.  This 
document will refer to ILMI 4.0.

Specification: ILMI4.0
Benchmarking Methodology Working Group	Page 11

INTERNET-DRAFT  Call/Cell Benchmarking Terminology October 1998

1.2.38.  Intermediate System (IS):

Definition: A system that provides forwarding functions or relaying 
functions or both for a specific ATM connection.  OAM cells may be 
generated and received.

Discussion:  An IS can be either the user or network side of a UNI 
signaling interface, or the network side of a PNNI signaling interface.

Specification: AF-TEST

1.2.39.  Leaky Bucket (LB):

Definition: Leaky Bucket is the term used as an analogous description 
of the algorithm used for conformance checking of cell flows from a 
user or network.  See GCRA, UPC and NPC.  The "leaking hole in the 
bucket" applies to the sustained rate at which cells can be 
accommodated, while the "bucket depth" applies to the tolerance to 
cell bursting over a given time period.

Discussion:  There are two types of LB algorithms- single and dual.  
Single LB defines a PCR, dual LB defines a PCR and SCR.

scalable, full function, dynamic multi-vendor ATM switches to be 
integrated in the same network.

Discussion:  PNNI consists of signaling and routing between ATM

mechanism to route ATM cells between two separate, autonomous 
ATM networks.

Specification:  AF-PNNI1.0

1.2.49.  Payload Type Indicator (PTI):

Definition: Resource Management is the management of critical 
resources in an ATM network.  Two critical resources are buffer space 
and trunk bandwidth.  Provisioning may be used to allocate network 
resources in order to separate traffic flows according to service 
characteristics.  VPCs play a key role in resource management.  By 
reserving capacity on VPCs, the processing required to establish 
individual VCCs is reduced.  Refer to RM-cell.

1.2.58.  Segmentation and Reassembly (SAR): 

Definition: The process used by the AAL in the B-ISDN reference 
model (see B-ISDN) which fragments higher layer PDUs into ATM 
cells.

of an ATM connection over time scales which are long relative to 
those for which the PCR is defined.  Enforcement of this bound by the 
UPC could allow the network to allocate sufficient resources, but less 
than those based on the PCR, and still ensure that the performance 
objectives (e.g., for Cell Loss Ratio) can be achieved.

Discussion:

1.2.66.  Transmission Convergence (TC): 

Definition: A sub-layer of the physical layer of the B-ISDN model 
transforms the flow of cells into a steady flow of bits and bytes for 
transmission over the physical medium.  On transmit, the TC sublayer 
maps the cells to the frame format, generates the Header Error Check 
(HEC), and sends idle cells when the ATM layer has none to send.  On 
reception, the TC sublayer delineates individual cells in the received 
bit stream, and uses the HEC to detect and correct received errors.

Discussion:  TC is not a measurement, but the speed in which TC can 
occur on a bit stream can be measured.  This measurement will not be 
discussed in this document.

Specification:  AF-UNI3.1

and congestion control procedures for ATM.  ATM layer traffic 
control refers to the set of actions taken by the network to avoid 
congestion conditions.  ATM layer congestion control refers to the set 
of actions taken by the network to minimize the intensity, spread and 
duration of congestion.  The following functions form a framework for 
managing and controlling traffic and congestion in ATM networks and 
may be used in appropriate combinations.

1.2.73.  Traffic Shaping (TS): 

Definition:  Traffic Shaping is a mechanism that alters the traffic 
characteristics of a stream of cells on a connection to achieve better 
network efficiency, while meeting the QoS objectives, or to ensure 
conformance at a subsequent interface.  Traffic shaping must maintain 
cell sequence integrity on a connection.  Shaping modifies traffic 
characteristics of a cell flow with the consequence of increasing the 
mean Cell Transfer Delay.

Definition:  UBR is an ATM service category, which does not specify 
traffic related service guarantees.  Specifically, UBR does not include 
the notion of a per-connection negotiated bandwidth.  No numerical 
commitments are made with respect to the cell loss ratio experienced 
by a UBR connection, or as to the cell transfer delay experienced by 
cells on the connection.

Definition:  Usage Parameter Control is defined as the set of actions 
taken by the network to monitor and control traffic, in terms of traffic 
offered and validity of the ATM connection, at the end-system access.  
Its main purpose is to protect network resources from malicious as well 
as unintentional misbehavior, which can affect the QoS of other 
already established connections, by detecting violations of negotiated 
parameters and taking appropriate actions.

1.2.79.  Virtual Channel Connection (VCC): 

Definition: A concatenation of VCIs that extends between the points 
where the ATM service users access the ATM layer.  The points at 
which the ATM cell payload is passed to, or received from, the users 
of the ATM Layer (i.e., a higher layer or ATM-entity) for processing

Specification:  AF-UNI3.1

1.2.84.  Virtual Source/Virtual Destination (VS/VD): 

Definition:  An ABR connection may be divided into two or more 
separately controlled ABR segments.  Each ABR control segment, 
except the first, is sourced by a virtual source.  A virtual source 
implements the behavior of an ABR source endpoint.  Backward RM-
cells received by a virtual source are removed from the connection.  
Each ABR control segment, except the last, is terminated by a virtual 
destination.  A virtual destination assumes the behavior of an ABR 
destination endpoint.  Forward RM-cells received by a virtual 
destination are turned around and not forwarded to the next segment of 
the connection.

2.1.  Definition Format (from RFC1242)

Metric to be defined.

Definition:  The specific definition for the metric.

Discussion:  A brief discussion of the metric, its application and any 
restrictions on measurement procedures.

Measurement units: Intrinsic units used to quantify this metric.  This 
includes subsidiary units, e.g. microseconds are acceptable if the 
intrinsic unit is seconds.


2.2 Definitions

2.2.1.  Cell Delay Variation (CDV):

Definition:  The variation in cell transfer delay associated with a given 
traffic load, orientation and distribution, as well as an integration 
period. CDV = max(CTD) - min(CTD) where max and min indicate 
the maximum and minimum over the integration period, respectively.

Discussion: CDV is a component of cell transfer delay, induced by 
buffering and cell scheduling.  Peak-to-peak CDV is a QoS delay 
parameter associated with CBR and VBR services.  The peak-to-peak 
CDV is the ((1-a) quantile of the CTD) minus the fixed CTD that

could be experienced by any delivered cell on a connection during the 
entire connection holding time. The parameter "a" is the probability of 
a cell arriving late. 

Measurement Units: seconds

2.2.2.  Cell Delay Variation Tolerance (CDVT):

Definition: ATM layer functions may alter the traffic characteristics of 
ATM connections by introducing Cell Delay Variation.  When cells 
from two or more ATM connections are multiplexed, cells of a given 
ATM connection may be delayed while cells of another ATM 
connection are being inserted at the output of the multiplexer.  
Similarly, some cells may be delayed while physical layer overhead or 
OAM cells are inserted.  Consequently, some randomness may affect 
the inter-arrival time between consecutive cells of a connection as 
monitored at the UNI.  The upper bound on the "clumping" measure is 
the CDVT.

Discussion:  

Measurement units:  seconds

2.2.3.  Cell Error Ratio (CER):

Definition:  The ratio of errored cells in a transmission in relation to 
the total cells sent in a transmission associated with a given traffic 
load, orientation and distribution, as well as an integration period.  
CER = Errored Cells / Total Cells Transmitted.

Discussion: The measurement is taken over a time interval and is 
desirable to be measured on an in-service circuit.

Measurement Units: dimensionless.

2.2.4.  Cell Loss Ratio (CLR):

Definition:  The ratio of lost cells in a transmission in relation to the 
total cells sent in a transmission associated with a given traffic load, 
orientation and distribution, as well as an integration period.  CLR = 
Lost Cells / Total Cells Transmitted.

Discussion:  CLR is a negotiated QoS parameter and acceptable values 
are network specific.  The objective is to minimize CLR provided the 
end-system adapts the traffic to the changing ATM layer transfer 
characteristics.  The CLR parameter is the value of CLR that the 
network agrees to offer as an objective over the lifetime of the 
connection.  It is expressed as an order of magnitude, having a range of 
10-1 to 10-15 and unspecified.

Benchmarking Methodology Working Group	Page 25

Measurement Units: dimensionless.

2.2.5.  Cell Misinsertion Rate (CMR):

Definition: The ratio of cells received at an endpoint that were not 
originally transmitted by the source end in relation to the total number 
of cells properly transmitted associated with a given traffic load, 
orientation and distribution, as well as an integration period.  CMR = 
Mis-inserted Cells / Total Cells Transmitted.

Discussion:  none

Measurement Units: dimensionless.

2.2.6.  Cell Rate Margin (CRM): 

Definition:  This is a measure of the difference between the effective 
bandwidth allocation and the allocation for sustainable rate in cells per 
second.

Discussion:  

Measurement units:  Cells per second

2.2.7.  CRC Error Ratio:

Definition: The ratio of PDUs received at an endpoint that which 
contain an invalid CRC in relation to the total number of cells properly 
transmitted associated with a given traffic load, orientation and 
distribution, as well as an integration period. 

Discussion

Measurement Units:  dimensionless


2.2.8.  Cell Transfer Delay (CTD):

Definition:  The elapsed time between a cell exit event at the 
measurement point 1 (e.g., at the source UNI) and the corresponding 
cell entry event at a measurement point 2 (e.g., the destination UNI) 
for a particular connection. 

Discussion: The cell transfer delay between two measurement points is 
the sum of the total inter-ATM node transmission delay and the total 
ATM node processing delay.

Measurement units: seconds
