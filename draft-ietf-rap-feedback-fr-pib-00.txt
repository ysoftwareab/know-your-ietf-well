Abstract 
   Currently there are no policy classes defined for the PEP to convey 
   provisioned policy usage feedback to the PDP. The purpose of this 
   document is to define the policy usage feedback framework PIB that 
   specifies the policy classes common for COPS feedback reports. The 
   basic operation and objects for reporting usage information are 
   defined in [COPS]. A specific clientSI feedback object named REPORT 
   is defined in [COPS-PR]. A framework for approaching solicited and 
   periodic usage feedback is described in [COPS-FEED-FRWK]. This

1 Introduction  
    
   The Framework of COPS-PR Usage Feedback describes the overall 
   approach to policy usage monitoring and reporting. This document 
   defines the specific Policy Information Base (PIB) framework for 
   policy usage feedback. The policy classes for monitoring and 
   reporting policy usage feedback as well as policy classes for 
   controlling reporting intervals, suspension, resumption and 
   solicitation are also defined. 
    
2 General Concepts  
     
2.1 Selection, Usage and Linkage Policies  
    
   There are three basic types of policy used to define what the PEP is 
   to monitor, record and report. These are the selection criteria 
   policy, the usage policy and the feedback report linkage policy.  
         
   The selection criteria policy is installed by the PDP. It defines the 
   conditions used by the PEP to monitor and record a usage policy. 
   Generally, the selection criterion is an existing PRI such as an 
   instance of the frwkIPFilterTable. This PRC is useful for specifying 
   conditions on which to base usage - i.e. count the number of packets 
   received for this filter. The filter (source address, destination 
   address, etc.) in this case defines the conditions. In the case of 
   the feedback framework PIB, the frwkIPFilterTable is the only PRC 
   used to base selection on.   
        
   The usage policy defines what attributes are monitored and recorded 
   by the PEP. These policies have an ACCESS clause of Report. 
   Generally, the usage policies specify counts related to a specific 
   action such as a packet being dropped. The feedback framework PIB 
   defines one usage policy class, frwkFeedbackFilterStats. It counts 
   packets and bytes as well as records the timestamp when the last 
   packet was received. Usage PRCs may be generic, collecting basic 
   statistics, or they may be specific to a particular usage. The PDP 
   decides which PRC(s) best suit(s) its requirements. The PEP may 
   support only one usage PRC, in which case all statistics are gathered 
   using instances of that PRC. Alternatively, the PEP may support 
   multiple usage PRCs. The PDP then decides which PRC to associate with 
   a particular selection criterion.  
     
    
   A usage policy and selection policy are tightly associated with one 
   another. A third policy is used to associate, or link, the selection 
   and usage policies. The frwkFeedbackLinkTable performs this linking 
   of the selection and usage policies. The feedback report linkage 
   permits the same selection criteria instance to be re-used for

   various usage policies. For example, the same IP Filter selection 
   criteria could be the basis of different usage policies such as 
   packet count, drop count, and remark count. The feedback type report 
   linkage references the selection criteria instance as well as defines 
   the policy class of the usage PRC. As noted above, the selection 
   criteria policy may be used for enforcement policies as well as usage 
   policies. This is the case with the frwkIPFilterTable.

                               Figure 1  
     
   Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between a selection criteria, 
   linkage and usage policies.   
        
   There is a one to one relationship between the report linkage policy 
   instance and the usage policy instance. The PDP is not aware of the 
   instance identifier of the usage policy when installing the selection 
   criteria and feedback report linkage policies. The usage policy is 
   instantiated on the PEP by the installation of a feedback report 
   linkage and the PEP designates the instance identifier. The usage 
   policy class always contains an attribute of type Prid which contains 
   the value of the associated feedback report linkage PRID [COPS-PR] 
   installed by the PDP. Note that the Prid type is a textual convention 
   for an object identifier that is the PRC of the table used for the 
   feedback report linkage and where the last sub-identifier is an 
   instance ID of the feedback report linkage.   
      
    
2.2 Normal Operations 
    
2.2.1 Connection Establishment and Initial Configuration Request   
        
   The Accounting Timer object in the Connection Accept message contains 
   the minimum number of seconds between reporting intervals as 
   described in [COPS] and [COPS-FEED-FRWK.] This is used as the basic 
   unit of measurement in defining intervals for specific usage policies 
   with the frwkFeedbackLinkInterval attribute.  
    
   The PEP notifies the PDP of the selection criteria policy classes and 
   usage policy classes it supports during the initial request for 
   configuration data using the frwkPRCSupportTable entries[FR-PIB]. The 
   PEP also indicates whether it supports the frwkFeedbackLinkTable as 
   well.

   The PDP responds to the initial request for configuration with a 
   DECISION that installs policies. The PDP may also specify maximum 
   reporting intervals associated with each of the usage policies and 
   does this with the frwkFeedbackLinkInterval attribute in the 
   frwkFeedbackLinkTable instance. The PEP monitors and records the 
   usage per the conditions defined by its associated selection criteria 
   policy. Periodically the PEP reports the usage with an feedback type 
   REPORT or provides a REPORT when solicited by the PDP. The PDP 
   solicits usage feedback with the frwkFeedbackResumeIndicator 
   attribute of the frwkFeedbackResumeTable.   
        
       
2.2.2 Unsolicited Reports - Periodic Reporting 
    
   Reporting may be periodic in nature and unsolicited. The intervals 
   at which the unsolicited reports are provided by the PEP are defined 
   in the specific Linkage policies. The defined intervals are based on 
   the number of seconds specified by the PDP in the ACCT Timer value. 
   There are cases when the PEP must supply unsolicited feedback 
   reports that may not fall on an interval boundary. The PEP must 
   provide an unsolicited REPORT containing all defined usages 
   instances just prior to the PEP issuing a Delete Request State and 
   just prior to the PEP de-activating a PIB instance context. 
 
2.2.3 Solicited Reports 
    
   The PDP may solicit policy usage feedback by issuing an unsolicited 
   Decision containing the frwkFeedbackResumeIndicator set to SOLICIT 
   USAGE NOW. The PEP is to provide a solicited REPORT feedback 
   containing usage feedback. The PEP shall continue to provide 
   periodic feedback as well at the specified intervals established at 
   client connection acceptance. 
  
2.2.4 Resuming and Suspending Periodic Feedback Reporting    
               
   The PDP may suspend usage monitoring and tracking at the PEP with the 
   frwkFeedbackResumeIndicator set to SUSPEND USAGE MONITORING AND 
   REPORTS. The PEP must stop tracking usage information and must not 
   issue any feedback reports. The PDP may only suspend feedback 
   reporting by setting the ResumeIndicator to SUSPEND REPORTS ONLY. The 
   PEP must cease sending unsolicited reports but is to continue 
   monitoring and tracking usage. The PDP may resume the sending of 
   feedback reports and may resume usage monitoring by setting the 
   ResumeIndicator to RESUME USAGE AND REPORTING.  
    
   The PDP may suspend or resume for all usage instances or the PDP may 
   specify one or more instances that are to be suspended or resumed. 
   The ResumeList contains a tag identifier that references a list of 
   one or more frwkFeedbackSolList entries. 
    
   The PDP may halt usage monitoring, tracking and reporting of usage 
   policies by removing the associated Linkage entry.

 2.2.5 Failover   
        
   In the event the connection is lost between the PEP and PDP, the PEP 
   continues to track usage information as long as it continues to 
   operate with the installed policy. When the locally installed policy 
   at the PEP expires, the usage policy data also expires.  
        
   Upon successful reconnection where the PEP is still caching policy, 
   the PDP indicates to the PEP that the PEP may resume sending of the 
   feedback type report messages. The PDP does this deterministically. 
   It issues an unsolicited decision containing the 
   frwkFeedbackResumeIndicator set to resume reporting. The PEP should 
   resume reporting at the next appropriate feedback interval 
   established upon the acceptance of the re-connection.  The PDP is 
   aware of the request state Handle(s) and the supported PRCs either 
   through the state synchronization mechanism or because the PDP 
   considers itself synchronized with the PEP upon reconnection.   
 
 
          
3 Summary of the Feedback Framework Policy Information Base  
     
3.1 SPPI ACCESS clause report-only    
           
   The selection criteria and linkage policy classes follow the 
   definitions specified by [SPPI]. This structure specifies well-
   defined policy classes and their instances residing in a common, 
   virtual repository [FR-PIB]. The additional PIB-ACCESS clause 
   attribute of "report-only" denotes the usage policy class reported by 
   the PEP.  
    
    
3.2 Feedback Type Report Group and PRCs  
           
   It is useful to define reporting intervals, and suspend, resume, and 
   solicit characteristics as well as the common usage and selection 
   criteria polices. These policy classes are common to account type 
   reporting for various technologies and apply to ALL SUBJECT-
   CATEGORIES. The policy classes belong to a new group, Feedback Type 
   Report Group. The policy classes in the Feedback Type Report Group 
   are:  
        
      1) Feedback Action Table   
      2) Feedback Action List Table 
      3) Feedback Linkage Table  
      4) Feedback Filter Statistics Usage Table  
     
    
3.2.1 Feedback Action Table  
    
   The Feedback Action Table contains the attributes that specify 
   action that the PEP is to take regarding policy usage, monitoring 
  
Rawlins et al.           Expires January 2002                 [Page 6] 

Internet Draft              FEED-FRWK-PIB                   July 2001 
 
 
   and tracking. The PDP may suspend usage monitoring and periodic 
   reporting, suspend periodic reporting only, resume usage and 
   periodic reporting or solicit immediate reporting. The action may 
   affect all feedback policies or be associated with one or more 
   policy instances. 
    
   The Feedback Action Indicator defines the action. The Feedback 
   Specific PRI indicates whether the action applies to all of the 
   usage policies or to a list. The Feedback List ID is the identifier 
   of the list of Linkage policy instances to which the action is to be 
   applied. 
    
   The PDP can solicit the PEP for immediate usage feedback. The PEP 
   shall respond with a solicited report containing the usage feedback. 
    
   The PDP can direct the resumption of usage monitoring and reporting 
   per the defined intervals. For example, the PEP may have re-
   connected to a PDP and has cached usage policies. The PDP indicates 
   to the PEP to resume usage tracking and monitoring and to send all 
   the cached usage policy.  The PEP shall respond at the next 
   appropriate interval with an unsolicited report containing the usage 
   feedback. 
    
   The PDP can suspend the monitoring of usage policy. The PEP 
   maintains the current usage that has been monitored but discontinues 
   any further monitoring until the PDP directs the PEP to resume 
   monitoring in a subsequent Decision. 
    
   The PDP can also suspend just the reporting of usage, but not 
   interrupt the monitoring and tracking of usage. The PEP shall 
   discontinue sending Report messages with usage feedback until the 
   PDP directs the PEP to resume. The PEP then begins reporting the 
   usage feedback at the next interval. 
    
        
3.2.2 Feedback List Table 
 
   This table contains a list of PRIDs of the linkage table for which 
   the PDP wants feedback reports. The value is referenced by an 
   attribute in the Feedback Resume Table. There may be one or more 
   instances associated with a specific list identifier defined by the 
   Feedback Action List ID. 
    
3.2.3 The Feedback Report Linkage Table  
     
   This table links the selection criteria instance with the usage 
   instance. It specifies the PRID of the selection criteria and the PRC 
   of the usage instance. This table permits the reuse of a selection 
   criteria instance for multiple usage policies.   
     
   The linkage table also permits the definition of a maximum reporting 
   interval to use when issuing the feedback type reports for the usage 
   instance. This interval is defined in units of the Accounting Timer

   Interval specified in the client accept message. A value of 0 in this 
   attribute indicates that the usage policy must be solicited. 
     
3.2.4 The Feedback Filter Statistics Usage Table  
  
   This table describes the packet counts, byte counts, last timestamp 
   when a packet was received and the PRID of the associated Feedback 
   Report Linkage instance. The count and timestamp information is 
   monitored and recorded by the PEP and supplied to the PDP with the 
   feedback type report message within the maximum interval specified.

5 Security Considerations  
        
     The feedback information is sensitive and requires that authorized 
     messaging occur between the PEP and the PDP. This protection can 
     be accomplished with IPSEC between the PEP and the PDP or using 
     the security mechanisms described in the base COPS protocol.
