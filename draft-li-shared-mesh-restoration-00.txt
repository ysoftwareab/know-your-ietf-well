 Abstract 
 
   Efficient techniques for rapid restoration must be addressed within 
   GMPLS. This document describes extensions to GMPLS and RSVP-TE 
   signaling in support of shared mesh restoration. Shared mesh 
   restoration describes restoration plans in which restoration capacity 
   is shared across multiple independent failures. In particular, this 
   document proposes extensions enabling reservation of restoration 
   capacity, LSP restoration, LSP reversion and LSP deletion. 
    
    
1. Introduction 
 
   Rapid recovery (restoration) from network failures is a crucial 
   aspect of current and future transport networks.  Rapid restoration 
   is required by transport network providers to support stringent 
   Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that dictate high reliability and 
   availability for customer connectivity.

   The choice of a restoration policy is a tradeoff between network 
   resource utilization (cost) and service interruption time. Clearly, 
   minimized  service  interruption  time  is  desirable,  but  schemes 
   achieving this usually do so at the expense of network resource 
   utilization, resulting in increased cost to the provider. Different 
   restoration schemes operate with different tradeoffs mainly among 
   spare capacity requirements and service interruption time as well as 
   complexity, robustness, etc. 
    
   In light of these tradeoffs, transport providers are expected to 
   support a range of different service offerings, with a strong 
   differentiating factor between these service offerings being service 
   interruption time in the event of network failures. For example, a 
   provider's highest offered service level would generally ensure the 
   most rapid recovery from network failures. However, such schemes 
   (e.g., 1+1, 1:1 protection) generally use a large amount of spare 
   restoration capacity, and are thus not cost effective for most 
   customer applications. Significant reductions in spare capacity can 
   be  achieved  by  instead  sharing  this  capacity  across  multiple 
   independent failures. 
 
   GMPLS signaling proposals have primarily focused on the development 
   of methods for label switched path (LSP) establishment and removal 
   [1,2,3] with some fault recovery capabilities. A framework for 
   recovery in GMPLS networks [16] has been provided earlier. A recent 
   Internet draft [4] examines how to realize some different restoration 
   schemes using GMPLS signaling. Other contributions [5,6,7,8,17,18] on 
   LSP restoration mainly focus on packet-level restoration. However, in 
   packet networks, restoration routes can be pre-established without 
   bandwidth being consumed until traffic is switched onto the route. In 
   contrast, LSPs in transport networks are provisioned by cross-
   connecting fixed-bandwidth channels, implying that zero-bandwidth 
   paths cannot be pre-established for later use. Thus, packet-level 
   restoration techniques must be extended to support efficient 
   transport network restoration. In this contribution, we motivate the 
   need for path-based shared mesh restoration using pre-calculated 
   routes in GMPLS, and we define extensions to support it.  The 
   required extensions are currently missing in previously proposed 
   contributions. 
    
   The current GMPLS signaling specification is based on extensions to 
   existing protocols - namely RSVP-TE [8] and CR-LDP [15]. The 
   introduction of new signaling protocols for restoration [9] is likely 
   to significantly complicate the standardization process and future 
   implementations. Instead, we propose extending the existing signaling 
   protocols to provide the necessary network failure restoration 
   functionality. We demonstrated a reference implementation of the 
   extensions to RSVP-TE described here for shared-mesh restoration in 
   [10], and have successfully demonstrated that rapid end-to-end 
   restoration signaling can be achieved using these extensions. Similar 
   extensions are required for CR-LDP. 
 
2. Restoration methods 
  
G. Li et al. Expire January 2002                              [Page 2] 
               draft-li-shared-mesh-restoration-00.txt      July 2001 
 
 
 
   We classify restoration techniques into path-based and link-based 
   [16]. Path-based schemes are implemented via an alternate or backup 
   path that may traverse multiple nodes. Failure recovery is typically 
   provided on a per LSP basis between a pair of nodes. Different LSPs 
   on a failed link, segment or path may use different restoration 
   techniques and traverse different restoration routes. In contrast, 
   link-based techniques are provided on a per link basis. Traffic on 
   the failed link usually traverses on the same restoration route. Note 
   that by "link" in this document we mean a "logical" link in the 
   network layer of interest (e.g., one or more similar-routed channels 
   between a pair of optical cross-connects).  
    
   In general, path-based schemes may protect an end-to-end path, a 
   segment or a single link.  The extensions proposed here are 
   applicable to all of these cases, although we focus primarily on end-
   to-end path-based restoration. Depending on the degree to which a 
   service provider wishes to protect LSPs, the service and restoration 
   paths may be link-disjoint, node-disjoint or Shared Risk Link Group  
   (SRLG)[1,2,13]-disjoint. SRLG-disjoint routes are important as they 
   cover several common types of failure that must be protected against, 
   including link failures, conduit cuts, etc.  
    
   There are a number of possible path-based restoration techniques for 
   transport networks. The interested reader is referred to [16] for a 
   complete taxonomy of MPLS-based restoration schemes. If the network 
   pre-establishes a restoration path for a given service path, then 
   restoration of the service path in the event of service path failure 
   simply involves cross-connecting the add/drop ports at the source and 
   destination from the failed path onto the restoration path. This is 
   referred to as dedicated path protection. Dedicated path protection 
   provides very rapid failure recovery, but is expensive in terms of 
   the spare capacity requirements. 
    
   Alternatively, if the network searches for restoration capacity and 
   establishes the restoration path only after service path failure, 
   then the restoration scheme is referred to as dynamic restoration. 
   Dynamic restoration may utilize techniques such as crankback [11] to 
   successively try different paths until a path with sufficient 
   resources is found. Dynamic restoration does not require pre-planning 
   on a per LSP basis and as such may be more robust to (unanticipated) 
   failures. The disadvantages of dynamic restoration schemes include 
   long worst-case restoration times, lack of predictability and no 
   guarantee of successful failure recovery. Dynamic restoration may be 
   particularly useful as a backup restoration technique when other pre-
   established or pre-calculated restoration routes are not available 
   (e.g., for multiple failure events in which insufficient restoration 
   capacity has been established / reserved).  
    
   Another path-based restoration technique is instead based on pre-
   calculating restoration routes, with cross-connection performed after 
   failure [10,12]. This approach allows efficient use of spare 
   restoration capacity by sharing this capacity across multiple 
  
G. Li et al. Expire January 2002                              [Page 3] 
               draft-li-shared-mesh-restoration-00.txt      July 2001 
 
 
   independent failures. In this scheme, when the service path for a LSP 
   is established, resources may be reserved along the restoration path 
   without allocating the resources to a specific LSP and configuring 
   the cross-connects on the restoration path. The resources reserved 
   for a particular restoration path can be shared with other 
   restoration paths if their service paths do not have any (single) 
   failure in common. In another words, if the service paths of two LSPs 
   are failure disjoint, (e.g., they fail independently), the resources 
   reserved for restoration can be shared on the common links of their 
   restoration paths.  We refer to this technique as shared mesh 
   restoration. Note that for all-optical networks without wavelength 
   conversion, restoration resources may have to be shared on a per-
   wavelength basis.  
    
   To implement shared mesh restoration, we require new extensions to 
   the existing GMPLS signaling specifications [8,15] for bandwidth 
   reservation, LSP restoration, LSP reversion and LSP deletion. These 
   signaling procedures are discussed in the following section. 
    
3. Shared mesh restoration 
    
3.1 Resource reservation for restoration 
    
   A restorable LSP in a transport network supporting shared mesh 
   restoration has both a service (primary) path and a restoration 
   (secondary) path. During normal network operation (without failures), 
   the LSP is established along the service path, with resources 
   (optionally) reserved along the restoration path. In implementing 
   shared mesh restoration, capacity may be reserved along the 
   restoration path during LSP provisioning [10,12]. The resources 
   reserved on each link along a restoration path may be shared across 
   different service LSPs that are not expected to fail simultaneously. 
   The restoration capacity might be either idle or used for pre-
   emptable LSPs. 
    
   The amount of restoration capacity reserved on the restoration paths 
   determines the robustness of the restoration scheme to failures. For 
   example, a network operator may choose to reserve sufficient capacity 
   to ensure that all shared mesh restorable LSPs can be recovered in 
   the event of any single failure event (e.g., a conduit being cut). A 
   network operator may instead reserve more or less capacity than that 
   required to handle any single failure event, or may alternatively 
   choose to reserve only a fixed pool independent of the number of LSPs 
   requiring this capacity.  
    
   The sharing of restoration bandwidth across multiple independent 
   failures can be simply illustrated using the topology depicted in 
   Figure 1. We consider an LSP established between A and C, and another 
   between F and H.  The service and restoration paths for the LSP 
   between A and C are A-B-C and A-D-E-C, respectively, whilst the 
   service and restoration paths for the LSP between F and H are F-G-H 
   and F-D-E-H, respectively. Thus, the link between D and E has 
   capacity reserved for the failure of both the service LSPs. If the

               draft-li-shared-mesh-restoration-00.txt      July 2001 
 
 
   service provider wishes to guarantee recovery from any single failure 
   event, and if the links along the two service paths do not share any 
   common failure (e.g., SRLG), then a single unit of capacity may be 
   reserved on the D-E link for the restoration of either of the service 
   LSPs. An example is provided in Section 6 that illustrates the 
   reservation of restoration capacity when guaranteeing recovery from a 
   single SRLG failure. 
                           A---------------B-------------C 
                            \                           /  
                             \                         /  
                              D-----------------------E 
                             /                         \ 
                            /                           \ 
                           F--------------G--------------H 
    
                           Figure 1. Example network topology. 
   When the amount of reserved capacity is a function of the number of 
   LSPs that are to be restored on each link, signaling is required to 
   reserve this capacity along the restoration path.  Details of 
   resource reservation are described in Section 4.1 
    
   In general, depending on the network operator's desired 
   functionality, channel selection may be performed either during the 
   reservation stage, or after failure. If channels are pre-selected, 
   the channel selection is stored during the resource reservation phase 
   as part of the reservation state along the LSP's restoration path. 
   Importantly, although the channels are pre-selected, the cross-
   connect is not established until after a failure. If channels are 
   pre-selected during the reservation phase, then restoration message 
   processing during restoration may be faster. However, if the pre-
   selected channels are dependent on the failure scenario, channel pre-
   selection may necessitate that fault isolation be performed before 
   connectivity can be restored. 
    
   Alternatively, channel selection may be performed after failure on 
   receipt of a signaling message for restoration. In this case, since 
   restoration capacity along the restoration path is only reserved but 
   not allocated, handling a fault translates into allocating the 
   restoration LSP after failure. This requires efficient mechanisms for 
   triggering and allocating the restoration LSP to meet the tight 
   restoration timing constraints. The LSP restoration time will depend 
   on the time to detect the failure, (possibly) localize the failure, 
   notify the node(s) responsible for restoration, and finally activate 
   the restoration LSP. Internet draft [16] shows a complete 
   specification of the various cycle times involved in different 
   recovery scenarios. 
    
3.2 Interaction with failure detection and localization 
    
   Both failure detection and failure localization are technology and 
   implementation dependent. In general, failures are detected by lower 
   layer mechanisms (e.g., SONET/SDH, Loss-of-Light (LOL)). When a node 
   detects a failure, an alarm may be passed up to a GMPLS entity, which 
  
G. Li et al. Expire January 2002                              [Page 5] 
               draft-li-shared-mesh-restoration-00.txt      July 2001 
 
 
   will take appropriate action. This section discusses models for how 
   failure detection interacts with and triggers end-to-end path-based 
   restoration.  
    
   One model generates alarms upon failure detecttion and uses IP 
   signaling to propagate a failure notification to the node(s) 
   responsible for initiating restoration. Fault localization is 
   important in this model to avoid having numerous alarms and IP 
   messages generated for each failed LSP. Where hardware-based (e.g., 
   SONET/SDH) fault localization techniques are not available, fault 
   localization can be performed using IP-based protocols, such as the 
   Link Management Protocol (LMP) [14]. Once the fault has been 
   localized, the node(s) adjacent to the failure send a failure 
   notification message to the node(s) responsible for restoring the 
   failed LSP, which initiates restoration. In RSVP, the failure 
   notification (NOTIFY) message is sent via normal IP forwarding with 
   optional end-to-end reliable transmission. 
    
   Using this approach, restoration may be delayed due to the fact that 
   failure localization needs to complete first. Additional delays may 
   be incurred when sending failure notifications if normal IP routing 
   has not converged. If the notification message is generated by a node 
   downstream (upstream) of the failure and sent to a node upstream 
   (downstream) of the failure, then normal IP forwarding may result in 
   the message following a route that is broken as a result of the 
   failure. The failure notification will thus not reach the node 
   responsible for initiating restoration until IP routing has 
   converged. 
    
   Another option is to trigger restoration based on failure detection 
   at the nodes terminating the LSP. Failure localization is now 
   targeted at the task of repairing the fault and becomes a background 
   task that can be performed on a much slower time scale.  However, it 
   is important that valid signaling actions for planned events (e.g., 
   LSP deletion) do not trigger failure notification and restoration 
   actions along the path. For example, if LSPs are deleted in an all-
   optical network by sending a single deletion message, LOL resulting 
   from disconnection at a node will propagate down the path faster than 
   the LSP deletion message, potentially triggering restoration. Thus, 
   for planned events that could result in LOL along the path, such as 
   LSP deletion, all nodes must be informed of the upcoming event so 
   that they may turn off alarms corresponding to the desired LSP so as 
   not to initiate restoration. 
    
   For uni-directional LSPs, failures will be detected at the 
   destination. For bi-directional LSPs, failures may be detected at 
   either the source, the destination or both, depending on whether 
   there is a uni-directional or bi-directional failure. Restoration 
   should then be initiated by either the source, the destination or 
   both. If restoration is initiated by the source (destination) and 
   only the destination (source) detects the failure, then a failure 
   notification must be propagated to the other end of the LSP. For all-
   optical networks, this failure notification may be done using IP

   messages, as above. However, most framing schemes in O-E-O networks 
   will be capable of hardware level notification upstream of the 
   failure, such as using SONET's Path AIS. Alternatively, restoration 
   can be initiated by both the source and the destination, with 
   restoration signaling meeting at an intermediate node along the pre-
   calculated restoration route. 
    
   All the above are potential implementations and therefore the 
   extensions proposed herein are intended to work independent of the 
   mechanism used for failure localization and notification. 
    
4. Operations overview 
    
   The following discusses how shared-mesh restoration may be supported 
   using extensions to RSVP-TE signaling. 
 
4.1 Restoration path reservation 
    
   When a LSP requesting path-based restoration is established, the 
   source node calculates the service and restoration paths for the 
   LSP. To satisfy SLAs, the network may reserve resources along the 
   chosen restoration path. To achieve this, the source node sends a 
   PATH message along the restoration path with a new  öshared 
   reservationö flag (see Section 5.2) requesting a shared reservation 
   along the path. The PATH message sent along the pre-calculated 
   restoration path reserves the required restoration resources and 
   establishes shared reservation state relating to the LSP without 
   cross-connecting the channels (see the example in Section 6). A RESV 
   message with the same flag is returned to acknowledge the resource 
   reservation along the restoration path, but without establishing the 
   restoration LSP. 
    
   In general, many carriers will want to protect their network against 
   at least any single failure event, such as a fiber cut, or a conduit 
   cut. If we generalize the SRLG concept, it may be used to represent 
   different failure-prone network components, such as a fiber span, a 
   node, a DWDM system or a conduit. Thus, for simplicity in the 
   following description, we assume that we are protecting against SRLG 
   failures.  
    
   The nodes along the restoration path need to know the path taken by 
   the service LSP so that reservations can be shared among SRLG-
   disjoint failures along the service path. Thus, the PATH message 
   sent along the restoration path includes information about the 
   service path.  Two options for service path information are 
   discussed in Section 5.3. The information can contain either a list 
   of the links along the service LSP, or a list of the SRLGs traversed 
   by the service LSP. 
    
4.2 Restoration path setup operation 
    
  
G. Li et al. Expire January 2002                              [Page 7] 
               draft-li-shared-mesh-restoration-00.txt      July 2001 
 
 
   As described in Section 3.2, restoration path setup can be triggered 
   in several ways. Path-based restoration may be triggered at either 
   the source or destination node, or both [12].  
    
   If the restoration signaling is initiated by the source, the source 
   node sends a PATH message along the restoration path with the 
   ôshared reservationö flag not set, indicating that the LSP should 
   now be established.  Since nodes along the path retained reservation 
   state for the restoration LSP, this state can be used to ensure that 
   restoration LSPs allocate resources out of the capacity reserved for 
   restoration. Upon receipt of the PATH message, the nodes along the 
   restoration path should check the cross-connect state for this LSP. 
   (This is needed in case restoration triggered from the destination 
   node has already performed the cross-connection.)  If the cross-
   connection has not been performed for this LSP, the node should 
   select channels for the LSP (if not already pre-selected), and 
   perform the required cross-connections. In nodes with potentially 
   slower cross-connect switching times (e.g., MEMS cross-connects) it 
   is important to have the PATH message be forwarded without waiting 
   for the cross-connection to be completed. The destination node sends 
   a RESV message to the source to acknowledge the successful 
   establishment of the restoration path. 
    
   If the signaling is initiated by the destination, then a RESV 
   message is sent along the restoration path with the ôshared 
   reservationö flag not set. Upon receipt of the RESV message, the 
   nodes along the restoration path should check the cross-connection 
   states for this LSP. If the cross-connection has not been performed 
   for this LSP, the node should select channels for the LSP (if not 
   already pre-selected), and perform the required cross-connections. 
   In nodes with potentially slower cross-connect switching times 
   (e.g., MEMS cross-connects) it is important to have the RESV message 
   forwarded without waiting for the cross-connection to be completed. 
   The source node sends a RESVCONF message to the destination to 
   acknowledge the successful establishment of the restoration path.  
    
   If both ends initiate restoration, the PATH and RESV messages for 
   the same LSP may meet at an intermediate node. This may result in 
   label contention. For a uni-directional LSP, the contention is 
   resolved using downstream label assignment. For a bi-directional 
   LSP, the contention is resolved based on higher node-ID label 
   assignment, as proposed for GMPLS [1,8]. When signaling messages 
   from the two ends meet at an intermediate node, the node sends a 
   RESV message to the source and RESVCONF to the destination in 
   response to the establishment of the restoration path.  
    
   When restoration is triggered from both source and destination, and 
   PATH/RESV messages are forwarded without waiting for cross-
   connection as described above, the receipt of the RESV or RESVCONF 
   does not guarantee the success of restoration path establishment. In 
   this case, a subsequent error message may override the 
   acknowledgment. This behavior must be evaluated further.

4.3 Error handling 
    
   In shared mesh restoration schemes, the reserved restoration 
   resources may be limited. During a restoration path establishment, 
   there may be scenarios in which the restoration path canÆt be setup, 
   for example, if there arenÆt adequate reserved restoration resources 
   due to any reason or if there is a failure along the restoration 
   path. In this case, PATHERR and RESVERR messages may be used to 
   report the failure of restoration path establishment. It is 
   important that any resources allocated by the incomplete restoration 
   path establishment be immediately released such that these resources 
   can be used for other restoration paths. 
    
   In the RSVP-TE extensions proposed for GMPLS, the PATHERR message 
   was extended to carry a ôstate_removeö flag to release the resources 
   consumed by incomplete LSP establishment. In shared mesh restoration 
   schemes, we may borrow the same idea and define a new flag 
   ôallocation_removeö, which could be carried in both PATHERR and 
   RESVERR messages. Upon receipt of PATHERR or RESVERR messages with 
   this ôallocation_removeö flag, the node does not remove all local 
   state but instead frees the cross-connect resources and releases the 
   channels to the reserved capacity pool.  
    
4.4 LSP reversion operation 
    
   After service path repair, most carriers prefer to cause the LSP to 
   revert back to its original service path. Often, the routing of the 
   restoration LSP may not be as efficient as the original service LSP.  
   Additionally, once a restoration LSP is established, there is no 
   guarantee that other service paths that were sharing its resources 
   are protected, unless the other restoration routes are re-
   calculated.  
    
   Reverting back to the service path after a failure is repaired 
   requires that the service LSPÆs resources remain allocated during 
   the time that the LSP uses restoration resources. For RSVP, 
   techniques must be developed that allow service path resources to 
   remain allocated even though refreshes may be affected by failed 
   signaling channels. 
    
   It is important to have mechanisms that allow LSP reversion to be 
   performed without disrupting service to the customer. This can be 
   achieved if LSP reversion is implemented using a ôbridge and rollö 
   approach. The source node commences the process by ôbridgingö the 
   customer signal onto both the service and restoration paths. Once 
   the bridge process has completed, the source node sends a 
   Notification message to the destination, requesting that the 
                                 
   destination ôbridge and rollö the service and restoration paths. In 
   this case, the ôrollö function causes the destination to select the 
   service path signal. Upon finishing the bridge and roll at the 
   destination, the destination sends a Notification message to the 
   source confirming the completion of the bridge and roll operation. 
   When the source receives this Notification, it stops transmitting 
  
G. Li et al. Expire January 2002                              [Page 9] 
               draft-li-shared-mesh-restoration-00.txt      July 2001 
 
 
   traffic along the restoration route, and sends another Notification 
   message to the destination confirming that the LSP is reversed. Once 
   the destination receives this Notification message, it issues a 
   RESVTEAR message along the restoration path and stops transmitting 
   along the restoration route. Additional mechanisms may be required 
   in some cases (e.g., all-optical networks) to ensure that 
   intermediate nodes do not alarm due to LOL during the teardown 
   procedure (see Section 3.2). The RESVTEAR message informs the nodes 
   along the restoration route to release the restoration resources if 
   shared restoration is used for this LSP.  This procedure achieves 
   the ômake-before-breakö feature, that is, minimal service traffic 
   interruption during the reversion process. Note that the RESVTEAR 
   removes the cross-connection for the restoration path (and frees the 
   resources to be used for restoring other failures), but does not 
   delete the Path state along the restoration path.  In this case, the 
   RESVTEAR should not trigger a PATHTEAR message from the source since 
   we want resources to continue to be reserved for this LSP.  This 
   allows the termination node to quickly re-establish the restoration 
   path by sending either a RESV or PATH message if the service path 
   fails again in the future.  The protection object with ôshared 
   reservationö flag is carried in the RESVTEAR message to suppress the 
   PATHTEAR. If the restoration paths are re-optimized periodically, 
   the original restoration reservation state should be cleared and new 
   restoration reservation state must be created.  
    
4.5 LSP deletion operation 
    
   Once an LSP is no longer required, the LSP service path and its 
   restoration resources should be released for future traffic. If the 
   source node initiates the LSP deletion, it should send two PATHTEAR 
   messages to the destination node: one along the service path and the 
   other along the restoration path. The PATHTEAR along the restoration 
   path should include information about the service path. The 
   information can contain either a list of the links along the service 
   LSP, or a list of the SRLGs traversed by the service LSP. If the 
   destination initiates the LSP deletion, it should send two RESVTEAR 
   messages to the source. The RESVTEAR along the restoration path 
   should include the information about the service path. Again, 
   additional mechanisms may be required in some cases (e.g., all-
   optical networks) to ensure that nodes do not alarm due to LOL 
   during the teardown procedure (see Section 3.2). 
    
5. RSVP-TE restoration extensions 
    
5.1 Current GMPLS fault restoration capabilities 
    
   The GMPLS signaling specifications [1] currently define protection 
   information used in the LSP setup procedure. This protection 
   information is carried in a new object/TLV that includes a bit flag 
   that indicates whether the LSP is a primary (service) or a secondary 
   (restoration) LSP.  
    
  
G. Li et al. Expire January 2002                             [Page 10] 
               draft-li-shared-mesh-restoration-00.txt      July 2001 
 
 
   GMPLS also specifies a Link Flags field in the protection 
   information object. The Link Flags field indicates the link 
   protection type desired by the LSP. If a particular type is 
   requested, a new LSP request is processed only if the desired link 
   protection type can be honored.  
    
5.2 Shared reservation/allocation request 
    
   To implement restoration resource reservation for shared mesh 
   restoration, a new mechanism must be introduced into PATH messages to 
   distinguish between normal LSP establishment, reservation of shared 
   resources, and allocation of shared resources to a particular LSP. 
   The S (secondary) bit in the protection information object may be 
   used to indicate that an LSP is a restoration/secondary path, not a 
   service LSP.   
    
   The shared resource reservation and shared resource allocation can be 
   explicitly indicated through a new Shared Reservation flag in the 
   protection information object.  The protection information object 
   would be used in the PATH/RESV message forwarded along the 
   restoration route during LSP resource reservation and resource 
   allocation.  
    
    0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    |S|R|                     Reserved                  | Link Flags| 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
         Figure 3. Protection information object. 
    
   The Shared Reservation (R) flag described above may be encoded as 
   follows: 
    
   0 allocation  
   1 reservation  
    
   If other flags are needed to support path-based restoration, the 
   shared reservation flag can be included in a Path Flags field. 
    
5.3 Service path information 
    
   To support shared reservations, intermediate nodes must compute the 
   total resources that must be reserved to support service paths that 
   are not subject to simultaneous failures. This requires 
   identification of the specific failure events that are to be 
   protected. If we wish to protect against link failures, then we must 
   know the set of links used along the service path when reserving 
   capacity on the restoration path. Alternatively, if we wish to 
   protect (more generally) against SRLG failures, when a restoration 
   LSP is reserved, the setup message must convey information about the 
   SRLGs that are associated with the service LSP that it is 
   protecting. Since a single restoration channel on a common link of 
  
G. Li et al. Expire January 2002                             [Page 11] 
               draft-li-shared-mesh-restoration-00.txt      July 2001 
 
 
   multiple restoration paths can be shared by non-simultaneous fiber 
   span failures. 
    
   This information is communicated by introducing a new object, the 
   service path information object, in the PATH message.  We propose 
   two alternatives for information that might be conveyed: 
    
   (1) LINK_LIST SERVICE_PATH INFORMATION object 
    
   The LINK_LIST SERVICE_PATH INFORMATION object denotes the set of TE 
   links [1,2] that are used along the service path. This information 
   can be used directly when restoration bandwidth reservation accounts 
   for link failures only. If we account for SRLG failures in our 
   restoration reservations, then the use of the LINK_LIST requires the 
   nodes along the restoration path to map from links to SRLGs.  
    
   (2) SRLG_LIST SERVICE_PATH INFORMATION object 
    
   If we account for SRLG failures in the restoration reservations, 
   then transmitting the list of links along the restoration route 
   would require that every node duplicate the calculation of the 
   associated set of SRLGs for the primary links. This calculation 
   could instead be performed only at the source node, with the set of 
   SRLGs then carried in the PATH message. We thus propose a SRLG_LIST 
   SERVICE_PATH INFORMATION object. 
    
   The SRLG_LIST carries the list of SRLGs that are used by the service 
   path. Each SRLG is defined as a 32-bit unsigned number [2,3]. In 
   this SRLG list, the order of specific SRLGs is not significant. 
   The information carried in the SRLG_LIST would be: 
    
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |                         SRLG 1                                |  
   |-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |                         SRLG 2                                | 
   |-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |                         ......                                | 
   |-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |                         SRLG n                                | 
   |-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
                   Figure 4. SRLG list. 
    
   The use of the SRLG_LIST is more straightforward and requires less 
   processing at each node than the LINK_LIST.  However, the LINK_LIST 
   is more generic and, in some realistic topologies, may be 
   significantly shorter.  
    
5.4 Path message format 
    
   The new proposed format for the PATH message is: 
   <PATH Message> ::== <Common Header>  
                       [<INTEGRITY>] 
  
G. Li et al. Expire January 2002                             [Page 12] 
               draft-li-shared-mesh-restoration-00.txt      July 2001 
 
 
                       [ <MESSAGE_ID_ACK> | <MESSAGE_ID_NACK> ] 
                       [ <MESSAGE_ID> ] 
                       <SESSION> 
                       <RSVP_HOP> 
                       <TIME_VALUES> 
                       [ <EXPLICITE_ROUTE> ] 
                       <LABEL_REQUEST >  
                       [ <SERVICE_PATH_INFORMATION> ] 
                       [ <PROTECTION> ] 
                       [ <LABEL_SET> ] 
                       [ <SESSION_ATTRIBUTE> ] 
                       [ <NOTIFY_REQUEST> ] 
                       [ <POLICY_DATA>    ] 
                       <sender descriptor> 
    
   Shared restoration resource reservation is done if and only if the 
   PATH message includes the <SERVICE_PATH_INFORMATION> and the 
   <PROTECTION> objects with S and R (shared reservation) bits set. 
   Otherwise, the <SERVICE_PATH_INFORMATION> is ignored and message 
   processing is performed as usual. Shared restoration resource 
   allocation is done if and only if the PATH/RESV message includes the 
   <PROTECTION> object with S bit set and the R bit not set.  
    
5.5 LSP establishment after failure 
    
   When a service path fails, the restoration LSP should be established 
   along the restoration path using the reserved restoration bandwidth 
   on each link. The LSP establishment along the restoration path may 
   be signaled from the source and/or the destination. A PATH message 
   is sent from the source including the <PROTECTION> object with S bit 
   set and the R bit not set, and/or a RESV message is sent from the 
   destination including the <PROTECTION> object with S bit set and the 
   R bit not set.  
    
5.6 LSP reversion extension 
    
   It is proposed that LSP reversion be handled using the RSVP 
   Notification message. The NOTIFICATION message should be extended to 
   include a status field describing each of the different steps in the 
   reversion process. The NOTIFY message includes the <ERROR_SPEC> 
   object, which has four fields:  node address, flags, code, and 
   value. The node address represents the address of the node 
   generating the notification. New codes/values in the <ERROR_SPEC> 
   object could be reserved to support reversion. Three new 
   codes/values are needed: 
    
   + Bridging completed 
   + Roll/bridge completed 
   + Roll completed  
    
5.7 Deletion extension 
    
  
G. Li et al. Expire January 2002                             [Page 13] 
               draft-li-shared-mesh-restoration-00.txt      July 2001 
 
 
   A PATHTEAR message or RESVTEAR message as defined in the GMPLS 
   signaling specification [Error! Bookmark not defined.,Error! Bookmark 
   not defined.] is used to remove (de-allocate) the service path. 
   Additional mechanisms required to ensure that nodes do not alarm due 
   to LOL during the teardown procedure are being developed for some 
   network applications û such as all-optical networks (see Section 
   Error! Reference source not found.). Once a restoration LSP is no 
   longer required, we must also release the reserved restoration 
   resources and any allocated resources along the restoration path. To 
   achieve this, the source sends a PATHTEAR message along the 
   restoration path, including the <SERVICE_PATH_INFORMATION> object. 
   Upon receipt of this message, each node along the restoration path 
   should de-allocate any resources allocated to this LSP (e.g., if the 
   LSP is currently using the restoration path) and decrement the 
   reserved resources accordingly.  
    
   The new proposed format for the PATHTEAR message is: 
   <PATHTEAR Message> ::== <Common Header>  
                       [<INTEGRITY>] 
                       [ <MESSAGE_ID_ACK> | <MESSAGE_ID_NACK> ] 
                       [ <MESSAGE_ID> ] 
                       <SESSION> 
                       <RSVP_HOP> 
                       [ <EXPLICITE_ROUTE> ] 
                       [ <SERVICE_PATH_INFORMATION> ] 
                       [ <PROTECTION> ] 
                       [ <SESSION_ATTRIBUTE> ] 
                       <sender descriptor> 
    
6. Example 
    
   We illustrate here how the above RSVP signaling messages can be used 
   to implement resource reservation for shared mesh restoration in a 
   network that aims to guarantee recovery from any single SRLG 
   failure. We also assume here that channels are selected after 
   failure and that full wavelength conversion capabilities exist if we 
   are considering an all-optical network. 
    
   With the GMPLS routing enhancements [2,3], each node will have a 
   representation of the transport network topology, including the 
   available bandwidth, and the list of SRLGs for each optical link. 
    
   When a new LSP request arrives in the network, the source node is 
   responsible for computing two SRLG diverse paths. An RSVP PATH 
   message is sent along the calculated service path to establish the 
   service LSP. An RSVP PATH message containing a Protection 
   information object with the S and R (shared reservation) bits set 
   should also be forwarded along the restoration path with information 
   that identifies the SRLGs of the service path. This information may 
   be conveyed using either the LINK_LIST or the SRLG_LIST. Upon 
   receipt of this message, each node should then update the 
   restoration bandwidth reserved on the outgoing links of the 
   restoration path. Assume that each link has a Reservation array 
  
G. Li et al. Expire January 2002                             [Page 14] 
               draft-li-shared-mesh-restoration-00.txt      July 2001 
 
 
   R[i], i=1,2,...,K, where K is the maximum SRLG index. There are 
   various techniques on how these arrays for each link can be 
   maintained among the nodes. These methods are not specified here. 
   R[i] indicates the bandwidth required on the link if the i-th SRLG 
   in the network fails.  The total reserved restoration capacity 
   should be calculated as the maximum over all SRLGs (i.e., max R[i], 
   i=1,2,...,K ). When a node receives a new reservation message, it 
   saves state relating to the LSP and updates the Reservation array on 
   its link(s) in the following way: R[i]=R[i] + reservation bandwidth 
   if the i-th SRLG is in the SRLGs associated with the 
   <SERVICE_PATH_INFORMATION> object. Once R[i] has been re-calculated 
   for all SRLGs associated with the service path, a new required 
   reserved capacity is calculated (i.e., max R[i]=1,2,...,K). If 
   inadequate capacity is available to support this new resource 
   reservation, the LSP reservation process may be abandoned, with an 
   error message (PATHERR) being returned to the source. The already 
   reserved resources must then be removed. However, if the reservation 
   is successful and the reserved capacity has changed as a result of 
   this new LSP, then updated link resource information may be flooded 
   to other nodes in the network for the purpose of path computation.  
   For example, the reserved capacity may reduce the available 
   bandwidth information that is flooded.  If the GMPLS routing 
   extensions were further extended to explicitly flood the bandwidth 
   reserved on each link, some additional improvement in network 
   utilization may be possible. 
    
   Similarly, when a node receives a message requesting the removal of 
   reservations for an existing restoration LSP, the restoration 
   capacity is updated for each of the SRLGs along the primary path: 
   R[i] = R[i] - reservation bandwidth if the i-th SRLG is in the set 
   of SRLGs along the service path. Again, this update may result in a 
   change in the link information that is flooded throughout the 
   network.
