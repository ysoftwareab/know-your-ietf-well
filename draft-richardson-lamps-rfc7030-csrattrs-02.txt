           Clarification of RFC7030 CSR Attributes definition
               draft-richardson-lamps-rfc7030-csrattrs-02

Abstract

   Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) is ambiguous in specification
   of the CSR Attributes Response.  This has resulted in implementation
   challenges and implementor confusion.  This document updates EST and
   clarifies how the CSR Attributes Response can be used by an EST
   server to specify both CSR attribute OIDs and also CSR attribute
   values that the server expects the client to include in its CSR
   request.

Internet-Draft                  CSRAttrs                      March 2022


1.  Introduction

   Enrollment over Secure Transport [RFC7030] (EST) has been used in a
   wide variety of applications.  In particular, [RFC8994] and [RFC8995]
   describe a way to use it in order to build out an autonomic control
   plane (ACP) [RFC8368].

   The ACP requires that each node be given a very specific
   SubjectAltName.  In the ACP specification, the solution was for the
   EST server to use section 2.6 of [RFC7030] to convey to the EST
   client the actual SubjectAltName that will end up in its certificate.

   As a result of some implementation challenges, it came to light that
   this particular way of using the CSR attributes was not universally
   agreed upon, and in fact runs contrary to section 2.6.  Section 2.6
   says that the CSR attributes "provide additional descriptive
   information that the EST server cannot access itself".  This extends
   to specifying that a particular attribute should exist, but not to
   the point of having the EST server actually specify the value.

   The way in which the CSRattributes were understood by [RFC8994] turns
   out to be invalid.  This document, therefore, updates section 2.6 to
   define this behavior.

   This document also updates section 4.5 to include revised ASN.1 that
   covers all uses and is backward compatible with the existing use.

   Additional examples are provided in an appendix.

2.  CSR Attributes Handling

2.1.  Current EST Specification

   The ASN.1 for CSR Attributes as defined in EST section 4.5.2 is:

      CsrAttrs ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (0..MAX) OF AttrOrOID

      AttrOrOID ::= CHOICE (oid OBJECT IDENTIFIER, attribute Attribute }

      Attribute { ATTRIBUTE:IOSet } ::= SEQUENCE {
           type   ATTRIBUTE.&id({IOSet}),
           values SET SIZE(1..MAX) OF ATTRIBUTE.&Type({IOSet}{@type}) }

   That section also states the following:

      the values indicating the particular
      attributes desired to be included in the resulting certificate's
      extensions



Richardson, et al.      Expires 8 September 2022                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                  CSRAttrs                      March 2022


   This has been interpreted by some implementations as meaning that the
   CSR Attributes response can only include values for the attribute
   OIDs that the client should include in its CSR, and cannot include
   the actual values of those attributes.  This is further reinforced by
   the example:

      Attribute:  type = extensionRequest (1.2.840.113549.1.9.14)
                         value = macAddress (1.3.6.1.1.1.1.22)

   This example illustrates that the 'value' specified is an attribute
   OID, for example the macAddress OID, and not the value (such as
   "10-00-00-12-23-45") of the attribute itself.

   There is no clearly documented mechanism with supporting examples
   that specifies how a CSR Attributes response can include a value for
   a given attribute such as SubjectAltName.

   EST section 4.5.2 also states the following:

      The structure of the CSR Attributes Response SHOULD, to the
      greatest extent possible, reflect the structure of the CSR
      it is requesting.

   This statement aligns closely with the goal of this document.
   Additionally, EST Extensions [RFC8295] Appendix A has an informative
   appendix that outlines how a full CSR can be included in the CSR
   Attributes response.

3.  Updated CSR Attributes Handling

   The WG will pick one option as part of the adoption call.

3.1.  Option two: Extend CSR structure to allow values:

   This ASN.1 needs fixing.

Internet-Draft                  CSRAttrs                      March 2022


      CsrAttrs ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (0..MAX) OF AttrOrOID

      AttrOrOID ::= CHOICE (oid OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
                            attribute Attribute,
                            value Value }

      Attribute { ATTRIBUTE:IOSet } ::= SEQUENCE {
           extType  ATTRIBUTE.&id({IOSet}),
           extAttr  SET SIZE(1..MAX) OF ATTRIBUTE.&Type({IOSet}{@type})
      }

      Value { ATTRIBUTE:IOSet } ::= SEQUENCE {
           extType  ATTRIBUTE.&id({IOSet}),
           type     ATTRIBUTE.&Type({IOSet}{@type}),
           value    OCTET STRING
      }

   This would just add a value to the SEQUENCE:

        OBJECT challengePassword
        SEQUENCE
          OBJECT subjectAltName
          SET
            OBJECT someACPgoo
        SEQUENCE
          OBJECT id-ecPublicKey
          SET
            OBJECT secp384r1
            OBJECT ecdsa-with-SHA384

   For example:

     0  30: SEQUENCE {
     2  28:   SEQUENCE {
     4   3:     OBJECT IDENTIFIER subjectAltName (2 5 29 17)
     9  21:     SET {
    11  19:       [1] {
    13  17:         UTF8String 'hello@example.com'
          :         }
          :       }
          :     }
          :   }

3.2.  Option three: explicit content for the key specification

   The following options support complete and unambiguous specification
   of

Internet-Draft                  CSRAttrs                      March 2022


   *  CSR ingredients optionally including values to use,

   *  the type of the public key, which is given in the form of a
      public-key algorithm,

   *  and the hash algorithm to use for the self-signature.

   CSR ingredients may be the subject DN, any X.509 extensions, and
   special attributes like a challenge password.

   For specifying the type of keys allowed in CSRs, they use a to-the-
   point KeySpec type.  It can be defined for instance as

      KeySpec ::= CHOICE {
                      keyAlg AlgorithmIdentifier,
                      rsaKeyLen INTEGER
      }

   The keyAlg type use used to specify public-key alorithms and can
   include parameters, such as the name of an elliptic curve.  The
   rsaKeyLen choice allows specifying the size of RSA keys, which it is
   not possible using values of type AlgorithmIdentifier.

   The keySpec could also be sequence of such specs, such that the
   server can give several key types from which the client can choose,
   e.g., EC keys on certain curves and/or RSA keys of certain sizes.

   Stick for syntactic backward compatibility with

       CsrAttrs ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (0..MAX) OF AttrOrOID

   Each OID given in AttrOrOID must occur only once.

   Plain OIDs are used mostly for challengePassword.

   Attributes are used mostly for any X.509 extensions, subject DN, key
   spec, and hash alg, while defining new generally usable OIDs for

   *  a subject DN of type Name

   *  a key spec of type KeySpec

   *  a hash alg spec of type AlgorithmIdentifier

   to be given on demand as attribute IDs of type
   ATTRIBUTE.&id({IOSet}).

Internet-Draft                  CSRAttrs                      March 2022


3.3.  Option four: explicit members for unique attributes

   Define a new and more to-the-point type, which does not require new
   OIDs:

      CsrAttrs ::= SEQUENCE {
           oids      SEQUENCE OF OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
           attrs     SEQUENCE OF Attribute,
           subject   [0] Name OPTIONAL,
           keySpec   [1] KeySpec OPTIONAL,
           hashAlg   [2] AlgorithmIdentifier OPTIONAL

      }

   Each OID given in oids or attrs must occur only once.

   The oids are used mostly for requiring a challenge password.

   The atttrs are used mostly for requiring certain X.509 extensions.

   This is, typically just challengePassword and extensionRequest are
   used.

3.4.  Option five: more specific structure, simpler extensions

   Define a new fully to-the-point type, which does not require any
   (direct) OIDs:

      CsrAttrs ::= SEQUENCE {
           subject               Name OPTIONAL,
           extensions            SEQUENCE OF Extension,
           challengePassword     BOOLEAN,
           keySpec           [0] KeySpec OPTIONAL,
           hashAlg           [1] AlgorithmIdentifier OPTIONAL

      }

4.  Co-existence with existing implementations

   There are some ways in which the new CSRattributes could co-exist
   with RFC7030.

4.1.  Use a new MIME type

   The client can signal that it supports the new attribute format by
   using an Accept: header in the transaction.  This acts as a signal to
   a server that it can/should return the attributes in the new format.

Internet-Draft                  CSRAttrs                      March 2022


4.2.  Use a new end point of the new format

   Clients that want to use the new format would use a new end point,
   such as "csrvalues" which would only support the new format.  A
   client which supported both would have to try both "csrvalues" and
   then fall back "csrattrs" if the EST server did not support the new
   format.  Some uses (such as [RFC8994]) require the new format, so if
   it was not suppored, that would be a protocol error.

4.3.  Insist new format is upwardly compatible with old format

   ASN.1 encoding is self-describing, and some formats proposed above
   could possibly be parsed by legacy clients without a problem.

4.4.  Return new format to new clients only

   The Registrar may know which clients are which by the kind of
   authentication that they do.  An [RFC8994] client which has just
   performed a [RFC8995] enrollment would be assumed to require the new
   format only.  A client which authenticates with an LDevID for a
   renewal would be strongly identified, and the Registrar could be
   programmed whether to return new format, or legacy CSR attributes.

5.  Whether or not to Base64 encoding of results

   [RFC8951] clarified that the csrattrs end point was to be Base64
   encoded even though the HTTP transport was 8-bit clean.

   If this document establishes a new end point, then the new end point
   will not be base64 encoded according to current HTTP usage.

6.  Examples

6.1.  RFC8994/ACP subjectAltName with specific otherName included

   TBD

6.2.  EST server requires public keys of a specific size

   TBD

6.3.  EST server requires a public key of a specific algorithm/curve

6.4.  EST server requires a specific extension to be present

   TBD

7.  Security Considerations

   All security considertions from EST [RFC7030] section 6 are
   applicable.

7.1.  Identity and Privacy Considerations

   An EST server may use this mechanism to instruct the EST client about
   the identities it should include in the CSR it sends as part of
   enrollment.  The client may only be aware of its IDevID Subject,
   which includes a manufacturer serial number.  The EST server can use
   this mechanism to tell the client to include a specific fully
   qualified domain name in the CSR in order to complete domain
   ownership proofs required by the CA.  Additionally, the EST server
   may deem the manufacturer serial number in an IDevID as personally
   identifiable information, and may want to specify a new random opaque
   identifier that the pledge should use in its CSR.  This may be
   desirable if the CA and EST server have different operators.

8.  IANA Considerations

   None.
