Abstract

   This document consists of two primary components, a schema for agents
   that make use of the Lightweight Directory Access protocol (LDAP) and
   a proposed use case of that schema, for distributed configuration of
   similar directory user agents.  A set of attribute types and an
   objectclass are proposed.  In the proposed use case, directory user

   agents (DUAs) can use this schema to determine directory data
   location and access parameters for specific services they support.
   In addition, in the proposed use case, attribute and objectclass
   mapping allows DUAs to re-configure their expected (default) schema
   to match that of the end user's environment.  This document is
   intended to be a skeleton for future documents that describe
   configuration of specific DUA services.

Internet-Draft    LDAP-based Agent Configuration Schema        July 2006


1.  Background and Motivation

   LDAP [RFC4510] has brought about a nearly ubiquitous acceptance of
   the directory server.  Many client applications (DUAs) are being
   created that use LDAP directories for many different services.  And
   although the LDAP protocol has eased the development of these
   applications, some challenges still exist for both developers and
   directory administrators.

   The authors of this document are implementers of DUAs described by
   [RFC2307].  In developing these agents, we felt there were several
   issues that still need to be addressed to ease the deployment and
   configuration of a large network of these DUAs.

   One of these challenges stems from the lack of a utopian schema.  A
   utopian schema would be one that every application developer could
   agree upon and that would support every application.  Unfortunately
   today, many DUAs define their own schema, even when they provide
   similar services (like RFC 2307 vs. Microsoft's Services for Unix
   [MSSFU]).  These schemas contain similar attributes, but use
   different attribute names.  This can lead to data redundancy within
   directory entries and cause directory administrators unwanted
   challenges, updating schemas and synchronizing data.  Or, in a more
   common case, two or more applications may agree on common schema
   elements, but choose a different schema for other elements of data
   that might also be shareable between the applications.  While data
   synchronization and translation tools exist, the authors of this
   document believe there is value in providing this capability in the
   directory user agent itself.

   Aside from proposing a schema for general use, one goal of this
   document is to eliminate data redundancy by having DUAs configure
   themselves to the schema of the deployed directory, instead of
   forcing the DUA's own schema on the directory.

   Another goal of this document is to provide the DUA with enough
   configuration information so that it can discover how to retrieve its
   data in the directory, such as what locations to search in the
   directory tree.

   Finally, this document intends to describe a configuration method for
   DUAs that can be shared among many DUAs, on various platforms,
   providing as such, a configuration profile.  The purpose of this
   profile is to centralize and simplify management of DUAs.

   This document is intended to provide the skeleton framework for
   future drafts, which will describe the individual implementation
   details for the particular services provided by that DUA.  The

   authors of this document plan to develop such a document for the
   Network Information Service DUA, described by RFC 2307 or its
   successor.

   We expect that as DUAs take advantage of this configuration scheme,
   each DUA will require additional configuration parameters, not
   specified by this document.  Thus, we would expect that new auxiliary
   object classes, containing new configuration attributes will be
   created, and then joined with the structural class defined by this
   document to create a configuration profile for a particular DUA
   service.  And that by joining various auxiliary objectclasses for
   different DUA services, that configuration of various DUA services
   can be controlled by a single configuration profile entry.

2.5.  Common Syntax/Encoding Definitions

   The proposed string encodings used by the attributes defined in this
   document can be found in Section 4.  This document makes use of ABNF
   [RFC4234] for defining new encodings.

   The following syntax definitions are used throughout this document.

                      The list of used syntaxes are:

   This document does not define new syntaxes that must be supported by
   the directory server.  Instead these syntaxes are merely expected to
   be interpreted by the the DUA.  As referenced in the schema
   definition in Section 3, most encodings are expected to be stored in
   attributes using common syntaxes, such as the Directory String
   syntax, as defined in section 3.3.6 by [RFC4517].  Refer to RFC 4517
   for additional syntaxes used by this schema.

3.  Schema Definition

   This section defines a proposed schema.  This schema does not require
   definition of new matching rules or syntaxes.  And it may be used for
   any purpose seen.  A proposed use of this schema to support elements
   of configuration of a directory user agent are described in
   Section 4.

   in [RFC4519]. cn is used to represent the name of the DUA
   configuration profile and is recommended for the relative
   distinguished name (RDN) [RFC4514] naming attribute.  This object
   class is used specifically by the DUA described in Section 4.  The
   syntax used to describe this object class is defined in [RFC4519],
   section 4.1.1.

4.  DUA Implementation Details

   This section describes an implementation of the schema described in
   Section 3.  Details about how a DUA should format and interpret the
   defined attributes are described below.  Agents that make use of the
   DUAConfigProfile object class are expected to follow the
   specifications in this section.

   Note: Many of the subsections in this section contain examples.
   Unless otherwise specified, these examples are rendered using the
   LDIF format[RFC2849].

4.1.  Interpreting the preferredServerList attribute

      Interpretation:

         As described by the syntax, the preferredServerList parameter
         is a white-space separated list of server addresses and
         associated port numbers.  When the DUA needs to contact a
         directory server agent (DSA), the DUA MUST first attempt to
         contact one of the servers listed in the preferredServerList
         attribute.  The DUA MUST contact the DSA specified by the first
         server address in the list.  If that DSA is unavailable, the
         remaining DSAs MUST be queried in the order provided (left to
         right) until a connection is established with a DSA.  Once a
         connection with a DSA is established, the DUA SHOULD NOT
         attempt to establish a connection with the remaining DSAs.  The
         purpose of enumerating multiple DSAs is not for supplemental
         data, but for high availability of replicated data.  This is
         also the main reason why an LDAP URL[RFC3986] syntax was not
         selected for this document.

         If the DUA is unable to contact any of the DSAs specified by
         the preferredServerList, the defaultServerList attribute MUST
         be examined, as described in Section 4.2.  The servers
         identified by the preferredServerList MUST be contacted before
         attempting to contact any of the servers specified by the
         defaultServerList.

      Syntax:

         serverList = hostport *(SP [hostport])

      Default Value:

         The preferredServerList attribute does not have a default
         value.  Instead a DUA MUST examine the defaultServerList
         attribute.

      Other attribute notes:

         This attribute is used in conjunction with the
         defaultServerList attribute.  Please see Section 4.2 for
         additional implementation notes.  Determining how the DUA
         should query the DSAs also depends on the additional
         configuration attributes, credentialLevel,
         serviceCredentialLevel, bindTimeLimit,
         serviceAuthenticationMethod and authenticationMethod.  Please
         review Section 5 for details on how a DUA should properly bind
         to a DSA.

      Example:

         preferredServerList: 192.168.169.170 ldap1.mycorp.com
           ldap2:1389 [1080::8:800:200C:417A]:389

4.2.  Interpreting the defaultServerList attribute

      Interpretation:

         The defaultServerList attribute MUST only be examined if the
         preferredServerList attribute is not provided, or the DUA is
         unable to establish a connection with any of the DSAs specified
         by the preferredServerList.

         If more than one address is provided, the DUA may choose to
         either accept the order provided, or choose to create its own
         order, based on what the DUA determines is the "best" order of
         DSAs to query.  For example, the DUA may choose to examine the
         server list and choose to query the DSAs in order based on the
         "closest" server or the server with the least amount of "load".
         Interpretation of the "best" server order is entirely up to the
         DUA, and not part of this document.

         Once the order of server addresses is determined, the DUA
         contacts the DSA specified by the first server address in the
         list.  If that DSA is unavailable, the remaining DSAs SHOULD be
         queried until an available DSA is found or no more DSAs are
         available.  If a server address or port is invalid, the DUA
         SHOULD proceed to the next server address as described just
         above.

      Syntax:

         serverList = hostport *(SP [hostport])

Internet-Draft    LDAP-based Agent Configuration Schema        July 2006


      Default Value:

         If a defaultServerList attribute is not provided, the DUA MAY
         attempt to contact the same DSA that provided the configuration
         profile entry itself.  The default DSA is contacted only if the
         preferredServerList attribute is also not provided.

      Other attribute notes:

         This attribute is used in conjunction with the
         preferredServerList attribute.  Please see Section 4.1 for
         additional implementation notes.  Determining how the DUA
         should query the DSAs also depends on the additional
         configuration attributes, credentialLevel,
         serviceCredentialLevel, bindTimeLimit,
         serviceAuthenticationMethod and authenticationMethod.  Please
         review Section 5 for details on how a DUA should properly
         contact a DSA.

      Example:

         defaultServerList: 192.168.169.170 ldap1.mycorp.com
           ldap2:1389 [1080::8:800:200C:417A]:5912

4.3.  Interpreting the defaultSearchBase attribute

      Interpretation:

         When a DUA needs to search the DSA for information, this
         attribute provides the base for the search.  This parameter can
         be overridden or appended by the serviceSearchDescriptor
         attribute.  See Section 4.6.

      Syntax:

         Defined by OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.12 [RFC4517]

      Default Value:

         There is no default value for the defaultSearchBase.  A DUA MAY
         define its own method for determining the search base, if the
         defaultSearchBase is not provided.

      Other attribute notes:

         This attribute is used in conjunction with the
         serviceSearchDescriptor attribute.  See Section 4.6.

      Example:

         defaultSearchBase: dc=mycompany,dc=com

4.4.  Interpreting the authenticationMethod attribute

      Interpretation:

         The authenticationMethod attribute defines an ordered list of
         LDAP bind methods to be used when attempting to contact a DSA
         [RFC2828].  The serviceAuthenticationMethod overrides this
         value for a particular service (see Section 4.15.)  Each method
         MUST be attempted in the order provided by the attribute, until
         a successful LDAP bind is performed ("none" is assumed to
         always be successful.)  However the DUA MAY skip over one or
         more methods.  See Section 5 for more information.



         none   - The DUA does not perform an LDAP bind.

         simple - The DUA performs an LDAP simple bind.

         sasl   - The DUA performs an LDAP SASL [RFC4422] bind using the
                  specified SASL mechanism and options.

         tls    - The DUA performs an LDAP StartTLS operation followed
                  by the specified bind method (for more information
                  refer to section 4.14 of [RFC4511]).

      Syntax:



         authMethod  = method *(";" method)

         method      = none / simple / sasl / tls

         none        = "none"

         simple      = "simple"

         sasl        = "sasl/" saslmech [ ":" sasloption ]

         sasloption  = "auth-conf" / "auth-int"

Internet-Draft    LDAP-based Agent Configuration Schema        July 2006


         tls         = "tls:" (none / simple / sasl)

         saslmech    = SASL mechanism name as defined in [SASLMECH]

         Note: Although multiple authentication methods may be specified
         in the syntax, at most one of each type is allowed.  I.E.
         "simple;simple" is invalid.

      Default Value:

         If the authenticationMethod or serviceAuthenticationMethod (for
         that particular service) attributes are not provided, the DUA
         MAY choose to bind to the DSA using any method defined by the
         DUA.  However, if either authenticationMethod or
         serviceAuthenticationMethod are provided, the DUA MUST only use
         the methods specified.

      Other attribute notes:

         When using TLS, the string "tls:sasl/EXTERNAL" implies that
         both client and server (DSA and DUA) authentication is to be
         performed.  Any other TLS authentication method implies server-
         only (DSA side credential) authentication, along with the other
         SASL method used for DUA-side authentication.

         Determining how the DUA should bind to the DSAs also depends on
         the additional configuration attributes, credentialLevel,
         serviceCredentialLevel, serviceAuthenticationMethod and
         bindTimeLimit.  Please review Section 5 for details on how to
         properly bind to a DSA.

      Example:

         authenticationMethod: tls:simple;sasl/DIGEST-MD5

      (see [RFC2831])

4.5.  Interpreting the credentialLevel attribute

      Interpretation:

         The credentialLevel attribute defines what type(s) of
         credential(s) the DUA MUST use when contacting the DSA.  The
         serviceCredentialLevel overrides this value for a particular
         service (Section 4.16.)  The credentialLevel can contain more
         than one credential type, separated by white space.

         anonymous The DUA SHOULD NOT use a credential when binding to
                   the DSA.

         proxy     The DUA SHOULD use a known proxy identity when
                   binding to the DSA.  A proxy identity is a specific
                   credential that was created to represent the DUA.
                   This document does not define how the proxy user
                   should be created, or how the DUA should determine
                   what the proxy user's credential is.  This
                   functionality is up to each implementation.

         self      When the DUA is acting on behalf of a known identity,
                   the DUA MUST attempt to bind to the DSA as that
                   identity.  The DUA should contain methods to
                   determine the identity of the user such that that
                   identity can be authenticated by the directory server
                   using the defined authentication methods.

         If the credentialLevel contains more than one credential type,
         the DUA MUST use the credential types in the order specified.
         However, the DUA MAY skip over one or more credential types.
         As soon as the DUA is able to successfully bind to the DSA, the
         DUA SHOULD NOT attempt to bind using the remaining credential
         types.

      Syntax:



         credentialLevel   = level *(SP level)

         level             = self / proxy / anonymous

         self              = "self"

         proxy             = "proxy"

         anonymous         = "anonymous"

         Note: Although multiple credential levels may be specified in
         the syntax, at most one of each type is allowed.  Refer to
         implementation notes in Section 5 for additional syntax
         requirements for the credentialLevel attribute.

      Default Value:

         If the credentialLevel attribute is not defined, the DUA SHOULD
         NOT use a credential when binding to the DSA (also known as

         anonymous.)

      Other attribute notes:

         Determining how the DUA should bind to the DSAs also depends on
         the additional configuration attributes, authenticationMethod,
         serviceAuthenticationMethod, serviceCredentialLevel and
         bindTimeLimit.  Please review Section 5 for details on how to
         properly bind to a DSA.

      Example:

         credentialLevel: proxy anonymous

4.6.  Interpreting the serviceSearchDescriptor attribute

      Interpretation:

         The serviceSearchDescriptor attribute defines how and where a
         DUA SHOULD search for information for a particular service.
         The serviceSearchDescriptor contains a serviceID, followed by
         one or more base-scope-filter triples.  These base-scope-filter
         triples are used to define searches only for the specific
         service.  Multiple base-scope-filters allow the DUA to search
         for data in multiple locations in the directory information
         tree (DIT).  Although this syntax is very similar to the LDAP
         URL[RFC3986], this draft requires the ability to supply
         multiple hosts as part of the configuration of the DSA.  In
         addition, an ordered list of search descriptors is required,
         which can not be specified by the LDAP URL.

         The serviceSearchDescriptor might also contain the DN of an
         entry that will contain an alternate profile.  The DSA SHOULD
         re-evaluate the alternate profile and perform searches as
         specified by that profile.

         If the base, as defined in the serviceSearchDescriptor, is
         followed by the "," (ASCII 0x2C) character, this base is known
         as a relative base.  This relative base may be constructed of
         one or more RDN components.  In this case, the DUA MUST define
         the search base by appending the relative base with the
         defaultSearchBase.

      Syntax:







Neal-Joslin, et al.      Expires January 2, 2007               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft    LDAP-based Agent Configuration Schema        July 2006


         serviceSearchList = serviceID ":" serviceSearchDesc *(";"
                             serviceSearchDesc)

         serviceSearchDesc = confReferral / searchDescriptor

         searchDescriptor  = [base] ["?" [scopeSyntax] ["?" [filter]]]

         confReferral      = "ref:" distinguishedName

         base              = distinguishedName / relativeBaseName

         relativeBaseName  = 1*(relativeDistinguishedName ",")

         filter            = UTF-8 encoded string

         If the confReferral, base, relativeBaseName or filter contains
         the ";" (ASCII 0x3B) "?"  (ASCII 0x3F) """ (ASCII 0x22) or "\"
         (ASCII 0x5C) characters, those characters MUST be escaped
         (preceded with the "\" character.)  Alternately the DN may be
         surrounded by quotes (ASCII 0x22.)  Refer to RFC 4514.  If the
         confReferral, base, relativeBaseName or filter are surrounded
         by quotes, only the """ character needs to be escaped.  Any
         character that is preceded by the "\" character, which does not
         need to be escaped results in both "\" character and the
         character itself.

         The usage and syntax of the filter string MUST be defined by
         the DUA service.  A suggested syntax would be that as defined
         by [RFC4515].

         If a DUA is performing a search for a particular service, which
         has a serviceSearchDescriptor defined, the DUA MUST set the
         base, scope and filter as defined.  Each base-scope-filter
         triple represents a single LDAP search operation.  If multiple
         base-scope-filter triples are provided in the
         serviceSearchDescriptor, the DUA SHOULD perform multiple search
         requests and in that case it MUST be in the order specified by
         the serviceSearchDescriptor.

         FYI: Service search descriptors do not exactly follow the LDAP
         URL syntax [RFC4516].  The reasoning for this difference is to
         separate the host name(s) from the filter.  This allows the DUA
         to have a more flexible solution in choosing its DSA.

      Default Value:

         If a serviceSearchDescriptor, or an element their-of, is not
         defined for a particular service, the DUA SHOULD create the

         base, scope and filter as follows:

         base   - Same as the defaultSearchBase.

         scope  - Same as the defaultSearchScope.

         filter - Use defaults as defined by DUAs service.

         If the defaultSearchBase or defaultSearchScope are not defined,
         then the DUA service MAY use its own default.

      Other attribute notes:

         If a serviceSearchDescriptor exists for a given service, the
         service MUST use at least one base-scope-filter triple in
         performing searches.  It SHOULD perform multiple searches per
         service if multiple base-scope-filter triples are defined for
         that service.

         The details of how the "filter" is interpreted by each DUA's
         service is defined by that service.  This means the filter is
         NOT REQUIRED to be a legal LDAP filter [RFC4515].  Furthermore,
         determining how attribute and objectclass mapping affects that
         search filter MUST be defined by the service.  I.E. The DUA
         SHOULD specify if the attributes in the filter have assumed to
         already have been mapped, or if it is expected that attribute
         mapping (see Section 4.7) would be applied to the filter.  In
         general practice, implementation and usability suggests that
         attribute and objectclass mapping (Section 4.7 and
         Section 4.13) SHOULD NOT be applied to the filter defined in
         the serviceSearchDescriptor.

         The serviceID is unique to a given service within the scope of
         any DUA that might use the given profile, and should be defined
         by that service.  Registration of serviceIDs is not addressed
         by this document.  However, as per the guidance at the end of
         Section 1, when DUA developers define their use of the
         DUAConfigProfile schema, they will define the serviceIDs used
         by that DUA.

      Example:



         defaultSearchBase: dc=mycompany,dc=com

         serviceSearchDescriptor: email:ou=people,ou=org1,?
          one;ou=contractor,?one;

Internet-Draft    LDAP-based Agent Configuration Schema        July 2006


          ref:cn=profile,dc=mycompany,dc=com

         In this example, the DUA MUST search in
         "ou=people,ou=org1,dc=mycompany,dc=com" first.  The DUA then
         SHOULD search in "ou=contractor,dc=mycompany,dc=com", and
         finally it SHOULD search other locations as specified in the
         profile described at "cn=profile,dc=mycompany,dc=com".  For
         more examples, see Appendix A.

4.7.  Interpreting the attributeMap attribute

      Interpretation:

         A DUA SHOULD perform attribute mapping for all LDAP operations
         performed for a service that has an attributeMap entry.
         Because attribute mapping is specific to each service within
         the DUA, a "serviceID" is required as part of the attributeMap
         syntax.  I.E. not all DUA services should necessarily perform
         the same attribute mapping.

         Attribute mapping in general is expected be used to map
         attributes of similar syntaxes as specified by the service
         supported by the DUA.  However, a DUA is NOT REQUIRED to verify
         syntaxes of mapped attributes.  If the DUA does discover that
         the syntax of the mapped attribute does not match that of the
         original attribute, the DUA MAY perform translation between the
         original syntax and the new syntax.  When DUAs do support
         attribute value translation, the method and list of capable
         translations SHOULD be documented in a description of the DUA
         service.

      Syntax:



         attributeMap      = serviceID ":" origAttribute "=" attributes

         origAttribute     = attribute

         attributes        = wattribute *( SP wattribute )

         wattribute        = WSP newAttribute WSP

         newAttribute      = descr / "*NULL*"

Internet-Draft    LDAP-based Agent Configuration Schema        July 2006


         attribute         = descr

         Values of the origAttribute are defined by and SHOULD be
         documented for the DUA service, as a list of known supported
         attributes.

      Default Value:

         By default, attributes that are used by a DUA service are not
         mapped unless mapped by the attributeMap attributes.  The DUA
         SHOULD NOT map an attribute unless it is explicitly defined by
         an attributeMap attribute.

      Other attribute notes:

         When an attribute is mapped to the special keystring "*NULL*",
         the DUA SHOULD NOT request that attribute from the DSA, when
         performing a search or compare request.  If the DUA is also
         capable of performing modification on the DSA, the DUA SHOULD
         NOT attempt to modify any attribute which has been mapped to
         "*NULL*".

         It is assumed the serviceID is unique to a given service within
         the scope of the DSA.

         A DUA SHOULD support attribute mapping.  If it does, the
         following additional rules apply:



         1.  The list of attributes that are allowed to be mapped SHOULD
             defined by and documented for the service.

         2.  Any supported translation of mapping from attributes of
             dissimilar syntax SHOULD also be defined and documented.

         3.  If an attribute may be mapped to multiple attributes the
             DSA SHOULD define a syntax or usage statement for how the
             new attribute value will be constructed.  Furthermore, the
             resulting translated syntax of the combined attributes MUST
             be the same as the attribute being mapped.

         4.  A DUA MUST support mapping of attributes using the
             attribute OID.  It SHOULD support attribute mapping based
             on the attribute name.

         5.  It is recommended that attribute mapping not be applied to
             parents of the target entries.

         6.  Attribute mapping is not recursive.  In other words, if an
             attribute has been mapped to a target attribute, that new
             target attribute MUST NOT be mapped to a third attribute.

         7.  A given attribute MUST only be mapped once for a given
             service.

      Example:

         Suppose a DUA is acting on behalf of an email service.  By
         default the "email" service uses the "mail", "cn" and "sn"
         attributes to discover mail addresses.  However, the email
         service has been deployed in an environment that uses
         "employeeName" instead of "cn."  And also instead of using the
         "mail" attribute for email addresses, the "email" attribute is
         used for that purpose.  In this case, the attribute "cn" can be
         mapped to "employeeName," allowing the DUA to perform searches
         using the "employeeName" attribute as part of the search
         filter, instead of "cn".  And "mail" can be mapped to "email"
         when attempting to retrieve the email address.  This mapping is
         performed by adding the attributeMap attributes to the
         configuration profile entry as follows (represented in
         LDIF[RFC2849]):

                    attributeMap: email:cn=employeeName
                    attributeMap: email:mail=email

         As described above, the DUA MAY also map a single attribute to
         multiple attributes.  When mapping a single attribute to more
         than one attribute, the new syntax or usage of the mapped
         attribute must be intrinsically defined by the DUAs service.

                 attributeMap: email:cn=firstName lastName

         In the above example, the DUA creates the new value by
         generating space separated string using the values of the
         mapped attributes.  In this case, a special mapping must be
         defined so that a proper search filter can be created.  For
         further information on this example, please refer to
         Appendix A.

         Another possibility for multiple attribute mapping might come
         in when constructing returned attributes.  For example, perhaps
         all email addresses are of a guaranteed syntax of "uid@domain".
         And in this example, the uid and domain are separate attributes
         in the directory.  The email service may define that if the
         "mail" attribute is mapped to two different attributes, it will
         construct the email address as a concatenation of the two

         attributes (uid and domain), placing the "@" character between
         them.

                    attributeMap: email:mail=uid domain

4.8.  Interpreting the searchTimeLimit attribute

      Interpretation:

         The searchTimeLimit attribute defines the maximum time, in
         seconds, that a DUA SHOULD allow to perform a search request.

      Syntax:

         Defined by OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.27.  [RFC4517]

      Default Value:

         If the searchTimeLimit attribute is not defined or is zero, the
         search time limit SHOULD NOT be enforced by the DUA.

      Other attribute notes:

         This time limit only includes the amount of time required to
         perform the LDAP search operation.  If other operations are
         required, those operations do not need to be considered part of
         the search time.  See bindTimeLimit for the LDAP bind
         operation.

4.9.  Interpreting the bindTimeLimit attribute

      Interpretation:

         The bindTimeLimit attribute defines the maximum time, in
         seconds, that a DUA SHOULD allow to perform an LDAP bind
         request against each server on the preferredServerList or
         defaultServerList.

      Syntax:

         Defined by OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.27.

      Default Value:

         If the bindTimeLimit attribute is not defined or is zero, the
         bind time limit SHOULD NOT be enforced by the DUA.

      Other attribute notes:

         This time limit only includes the amount of time required to
         perform the LDAP bind operation.  If other operations are
         required, those operations do not need to be considered part of
         the bind time.  See searchTimeLimit for the LDAP search
         operation.

4.10.  Interpreting the followReferrals attribute

      Interpretation:

         If set to TRUE, the DUA SHOULD follow any referrals if
         discovered.

         If set to FALSE, the DUA MUST NOT follow referrals.

      Syntax:

         Defined by OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.7.  [RFC4517]

      Default Value:

         If the followReferrals attribute is not set or set to an
         invalid value the default value is TRUE.

4.11.  Interpreting the dereferenceAliases attribute

      Interpretation:

         If set to TRUE, the DUA SHOULD enable alias dereferencing.

         If set to FALSE, the DUA MUST NOT enable alias dereferencing.

      Syntax:

         Defined by OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.7.

      Default Value:

         If the dereferenceAliases attribute is not set or set to an
         invalid value the default value is TRUE.

4.12.  Interpreting the profileTTL attribute

      Interpretation:





Neal-Joslin, et al.      Expires January 2, 2007               [Page 24]

Internet-Draft    LDAP-based Agent Configuration Schema        July 2006


         The profileTTL attribute defines how often the DUA SHOULD re-
         load and reconfigure itself using the corresponding
         configuration profile entry.  The value is represented in
         seconds.  Once a DUA reloads the profile entry, it SHOULD re-
         configure itself with the new values.

      Syntax:

         Defined by OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.27.

      Default Value:

         If not specified the DUA MAY use its own reconfiguration
         policy.

      Other attribute notes:

         If the profileTTL value is zero, the DUA SHOULD NOT
         automatically re-load the configuration profile.

4.13.  Interpreting the objectclassMap attribute

      Interpretation:

         A DUA MAY perform objectclass mapping for all LDAP operations
         performed for a service that has an objectclassMap entry.
         Because objectclass mapping is specific for each service within
         the DUA, a "serviceID" is required as part of the
         objectclassMap syntax.  I.E. Not all DUA services should
         necessarily perform the same objectclass mapping.

         Objectclass mapping SHOULD be used in conjunction with
         attribute mapping to map the required schema by the service to
         an equivalent schema that is available in the directory.

         Objectclass mapping may or may not be required by a DUA.
         Often, the objectclass attribute is used in search filters.
         Section 4.7 recommends that attribute mapping not be applied to
         the serviceSearchDescriptor.  Thus, if the default
         objectclasses are not used in a DUA deployment, typically only
         the serviceSearchDescriptor needs to be defined to reflect that
         mapping.  However, when the service search descriptor is not
         provided, and the default search filter for that service
         contains the objectclass attribute, that search filter SHOULD
         be re-defined by objectclass mapping if defined.  If a default
         search filter is not used, it SHOULD be re-defined through the
         serviceSearchDescriptor.  If a serviceSearchDescriptor is
         defined for a particular service, it SHOULD NOT be re-mapped by



Neal-Joslin, et al.      Expires January 2, 2007               [Page 25]

Internet-Draft    LDAP-based Agent Configuration Schema        July 2006


         either the objectclassMap or attributeMap values.

         One condition where the objectclassMap SHOULD be used is when
         the DUA is providing gateway functionality.  In this case, the
         DUA is acting on behalf of another service, which may pass in a
         search filter itself.  In this type of DUA, the DUA may alter
         the search filter according to the appropriate attributeMap and
         objectclassMap values.  And in this case, it is also assumed
         that a serviceSearchDescriptor is not defined.

      Syntax:



         objectclassMap    = serviceID ":" origObjectclass "="
                             objectclass

         origObjectclass   = objectclass

         objectclass       = keystring

         Values of the origObjectclass depend on the type of DUA Service
         using the objectclass mapping feature.

      Default Value:

         The DUA MUST NOT remap an objectclass unless it is explicitly
         defined by an objectclassMap attribute.

      Other attribute notes:

         A DUA SHOULD support objectclass mapping.  If it does, the DUA
         MUST support mapping of objectclasses using the objectclass
         OID.  It SHOULD support objectclass mapping based on the
         objectclass name.

         It is assumed the serviceID is unique to a given service within
         the scope of the DSA.

      Example:

         Suppose a DUA is acting on behalf of an email service.  By
         default the "email" service uses the "mail", "cn" and "sn"
         attributes to discover mail addresses in entries created using
         inetOrgPerson objectclass[RFC2789].  However, the email service
         has been deployed in an environment that uses entries created
         using "employee" objectclass.  In this case, the attribute "cn"
         can be mapped to "employeeName", and "inetOrgPerson" can be

Internet-Draft    LDAP-based Agent Configuration Schema        July 2006


         mapped to "employee", allowing the DUA to perform LDAP
         operations using the entries that exist in the directory.  This
         mapping is performed by adding attributeMap and objectclassMap
         attributes to the configuration profile entry as follows
         (represented in LDIF[RFC2849]):

                attributeMap: email:cn=employeeName
                objectclassMap: email:inetOrgPerson=employee

4.14.  Interpreting the defaultSearchScope attribute

      Interpretation:

         When a DUA needs to search the DSA for information, this
         attribute provides the "scope" for the search.  This parameter
         can be overridden by the serviceSearchDescriptor attribute.
         See Section 4.6.

      Syntax:

         scopeSyntax = "base" / "one" / "sub"

      Default Value:

         The default value for the defaultSearchScope SHOULD be defined
         by the DUA service.  If the default search scope for a service
         is not defined then the scope SHOULD be for the DUA to perform
         a subtree search.

4.15.  Interpreting the serviceAuthenticationMethod attribute

      Interpretation:

         The serviceAuthenticationMethod attribute defines an ordered
         list of LDAP bind methods to be used when attempting to contact
         a DSA for a particular service.  Interpretation and use of this
         attribute is the same as Section 4.4, but specific for each
         service.

      Syntax:

         svAuthMethod = serviceID ":" method *(";" method)

         Note: Although multiple authentication methods may be specified
         in the syntax, at most one of each type is allowed.

Internet-Draft    LDAP-based Agent Configuration Schema        July 2006


      Default Value:

         If the serviceAuthenticationMethod attribute is not provided,
         the authenticationMethod SHOULD be followed, or its default.

      Other attribute notes:

         Determining how the DUA should bind to the DSAs also depends on
         the additional configuration attributes, credentialLevel,
         serviceCredentialLevel and bindTimeLimit.  Please review
         Section 5 for details on how to properly bind to a DSA.

      Example:

         serviceAuthenticationMethod: email:tls:simple;sasl/DIGEST-MD5

4.16.  Interpreting the serviceCredentialLevel attribute

      Interpretation:

         The serviceCredentialLevel attribute defines what type(s) of
         credential(s) the DUA SHOULD use when contacting the DSA for a
         particular service.  Interpretation and used of this attribute
         are the same as Section 4.5.

      Syntax:

         svCredentialLevel = serviceID ":" level *(SP level)

         Refer to implementation notes in Section 5 for additional
         syntax requirements for the credentialLevel attribute.

         Note: Although multiple credential levels may be specified in
         the syntax, at most one of each type is allowed.

      Default Value:

         If the serviceCredentialLevel attribute is not defined, the DUA
         MUST examine the credentialLevel attribute, or follow its
         default if not provided.

      Other attribute notes:

         Determining how the DUA should bind to the DSAs also depends on
         the additional configuration attributes,
         serviceAuthenticationMethod, authenticationMethod and
         bindTimeLimit.  Please review Section 5 for details on how to
         properly bind to a DSA.

5.  Binding to the Directory Server

   The DUA SHOULD use the following algorithm when binding to the
   server:

   for (clevel in credLevel) [see note 1]
     if (clevel is "anonymous")
       for (host in hostnames) [see note 2]
         if (server is responding)
           return success
       return failure
     else
       for (amethod in authMethod) [see note 3]
         if (amethod is none)
           for (host in hostnames)
             if (server is responding)
               return success
           return failure
         else
           for (host in hostnames)
             authenticate using amethod and clevel
             if (authentication passed)
               return success
   return failure

   Note 1:  The credLevel is a list of credential levels as defined in
            serviceCredentialLevel (Section 4.16) for a given service.
            If the serviceCredentialLevel is not defined, the DUA MUST
            examine the credentialLevel attribute.

   Note 2:  hostnames is the list of servers to contact as defined in
            Section 4.1 and Section 4.2.

   Note 3:  The authMethod is a list of authentication methods as
            defined in serviceAuthenticationMethod (Section 4.15) for a
            given service.  If the serviceAuthenticationMethod is not
            defined, the DUA MUST examine the authenticationMethod
            attribute.

6.  Security Considerations

   The profile entries MUST be protected against unauthorized
   modification.  Each service needs to consider implications of
   providing its service configuration as part of this profile and limit
   access to the profile entries accordingly.

   The management of the authentication credentials for the DUA is
   outside the scope of this document and needs to be handled by the
   DUA.

   Since the DUA needs to know how to properly bind to the directory
   server, the access control configuration of the DSA MUST assure that
   the DSA can view all the elements of the DUAConfigProfile attributes.
   For example, if the credentialLevel attribute contains "Self" but the
   DSA is unable to access the credentialLevel attribute, the DUA will
   instead attempt an anonymous connection to the directory server.

   The algorithm described by Section 5 also has security
   considerations.  Altering that design will alter the security aspects
   of the configuration profile.

Appendix A.  Examples

   In this section we will describe a fictional DUA which provides one
   service, called the "email" service.  This service would be similar
   to an email client that uses an LDAP directory to discover email
   addresses based on a textual representation of the recipient's
   colloquial name.

   This email service is defined by default to expect that users with
   email addresses will be of the "inetOrgPerson" objectclass type
   [RFC2789].  And by default, the "email" service expects the
   colloquial name to be stored in the "cn" attribute, while it expects
   the email address to be stored in the "mail" attribute (as one would
   expect as defined by the inetOrgPerson objectclass.)

   As a special feature, the "email" service will perform a special type
   of attribute mapping, when performing searches.  If the "cn"
   attribute has been mapped to two or more attributes, the "email"
   service will parse the requested search string and map each white-
   space separated token into the mapped attributes, respectively.

   The default search filter for the "email" service is
   "(objectclass=inetOrgPerson)".  The email service also defines that
   when it performs a name to address discovery, it will wrap the search
   filter inside a complex search filter as follows:

   (&(<filter>)(cn~=<name string>)

   or if "cn" has been mapped to multiple attributes, that wrapping
   would appear as follows:

   (&(<filter>)(attr1~=<token1>)(attr2~=<token2>)...)

   The below examples show how the "email" service builds it search
   requests, based on the defined profile.  In all cases, the
   defaultSearchBase is "o=airius.com" and the defaultSearchScope is
   undefined.

   In addition, for all examples, we assume that the "email" service has
   been requested to discover the email address for "Jane Hernandez."

   Example 1:

   serviceSearchDescriptor: email:"ou=marketing,"

   base: ou=marketing,o=airius.com
   scope: sub
   filter: (&(objectclass=inetOrgPerson)(cn~=Jane Hernandez))

   Example 2:

   serviceSearchDescriptor: email:"ou=marketing,"?one?
    (&(objectclass=inetOrgPerson)(c=us))
   attributeMap: email:cn=2.5.4.42 sn

   Note: 2.5.4.42 is the OID that represents the "givenName"
   attribute.

   In this example, the email service performs <name string> parsing as
   described above to generate a complex search filter.  The above
   example results in one search.

   base: ou=marketing,o=airius.com
   scope: one
   filter: (&(&(objectclass=inetOrgPerson)(c=us))
               (2.5.4.42~=Jane)(sn~=Hernandez))

   Example 3:

   serviceSearchDescriptor: email:ou=marketing,"?base
   attributeMap: email:cn=name


   This example is invalid, because either the quote should have been
   escaped, or there should have been a leading quote.

   Example 4:

   serviceSearchDescriptor: email:ou=\\mar\\\\keting,\\"?base
   attributeMap: email:cn=name

   base: ou=\\mar\\keting,"
   scope: base
   filter (&(objectclass=inetOrgPerson)(name~=Jane Hernandez))

   Example 5:

   serviceSearchDescriptor: email:ou="marketing",o=supercom

   This example is invalid, since the quote was not a leading quote, and
   thus should have been escaped.

   Example 6:

   serviceSearchDescriptor: email:??(&(objectclass=person)
                                    (ou=Org1 \\\\(temporary\\\\)))

   base: o=airius.com
   scope: sub
   filter: (&((&(objectclass=person)(ou=Org1 \\(Temporary\\)))
             (cn~=Jane Henderson)))

   Example 7:

   serviceSearchDescriptor: email:"ou=funny?org,"

   base: ou=funny?org,o=airius.com
   scope: sub
   filter (&(objectclass=inetOrgPerson)(cn~=Jane Hernandez))
