Abstract

   The Resource ReserVation Protocol (RSVP) defines an ERROR_SPEC object
   for communicating errors.  That object has a defined format that
   permits the definition of 256 error codes.  As RSVP has been
   developed and extended, the convention has been to be conservative in
   defining new error codes.  Further, no provision for user-defined
   errors exists in RSVP.

   This document defines a USER_ERROR_SPEC to be used in addition to the
   ERROR_SPEC to carry additional user information related to errors.

1. Introduction

   The Resource ReserVation Protocol (RSVP) [RFC2205] defines an
   ERROR_SPEC object for communicating errors.  That object has a
   defined format that permits the definition of 256 error codes.  As
   RSVP has been developed and extended, the convention has been to be
   conservative in communicating errors.  Further no provision for user
   defined errors exists in RSVP.

   When developing extensions to RSVP, it is often useful for those
   implementing to define error messages to aid both in the initial
   debugging and in testing against older versions or other
   implementations.

   This document defines a new RSVP object to permit user-defined errors
   to be communicated.  This will enable organizations to define errors
   which they can use for internal development.  These error values
   could also be shared with the community at large to aid in promoting
   interoperability between diverse implementations.

   RSVP PathErr and ResvErr messages require the presence of an
   ERROR_SPEC object ([RFC2205]).  [RFC3473] defines the Notify message
   that also requires the presence of an ERROR_SPEC object.  In order to
   not change the mandatory contents of these messages, this document
   defines a new error code value that indicates that the new object is
   present and carries a user-defined error code.

   Note that the ResvConf message defined in [RFC2205] also carries an
   ERROR_SPEC object. But this usage of the object does not carry
   meaningful Error Codes or Error Values and so the extensions defined
   in this document are not applicable to that message.

1.1. Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2. User-Defined Error

   A new Error Code is defined for use in an ERROR_SPEC object.

      Error Code = <tba-xxx>: User Error Spec

      This error code is used to signal the presence of a
      USER_ERROR_SPEC.  One Error Value is defined as follows.

        Error Value 0 = Further details in User Error Spec

        Further error values may be defined in future specifications.

   When sending this error code, a USER_ERROR_SPEC object MUST be
   included in the PathErr, ResvErr, or Notify message.

[RFC Editor's note: <tba-xxx> = to be assigned by IANA as per Section 5.
 Please replace <tba-xxx> with the number assigned by IANA and remove
 this note.]

3. USER_ERROR_SPEC Class

   A new RSVP object class called USER_ERROR_SPEC is defined. To support
   backwards compatibility, its class number is in the range 192-247. As
   defined in [RFC2205], implementations that do not understand such an
   object will forward it unmodified.

   USER_ERROR_SPEC object: Class = <tba-yyy>, C-Type = 1

[RFC Editor's note: <tba-yyy> = to be assigned by IANA as per Section 5.
 Please replace <tba-yyy> with the number assigned by IANA and remove
 this note.]

     Enterprise Number

        A unique identifier of an organization encoded as a 32-bit
        integer.  Enterprise Numbers (sometimes known as Private
        Enterprise Numbers) are assigned by IANA and managed on a first
        come first served basis through the IANA registry named
        "Enterprise Numbers" [RFC2578].

     Sub Org

        A unique identifier of an organization encoded as an 8-bit
        integer.  An organization MAY use this field to create
        independent Error Value spaces.  This is intended to
        facilitate teams which are doing parallel development.  If
        independent spaces are not required, this field SHOULD be
        set to zero.

     Err Desc Len

        The length of the error description in the Error Description
        field in bytes excluding any padding. Zero is a valid length if
        no error description is supplied.

     User Error Value

        A 16-bit integer. The meaning is specified by the
        (sub-)organization indicated by the Enterprise Number and Sub
        Org fields.

     Error Description

        A string of characters in US-ASCII [ASCII] padded with nulls
        (0x00) to a multiple of 4 bytes. If the Err Desc Len is zero
        then no bytes are supplied.

        Note that the content of this field is implementation-specific.
        It is typically printable, but might not be shown to all users
        in all implementations (because it is limited to US-ASCII).
        Therefore, the content of the field SHOULD be limited to
        supplementary information and SHOULD NOT contain information
        critical to operating the network. Criticial information is
        present in the User Error Value field.

     User-Defined Subobjects

        User-defined subobjects MAY be included.  The generic format of
        subobjects is specified in Section 3.1.  The semantics of a
        subobject is indicated by the Type field, but the semantics,
        format and contents of the Value field are specified by the

Swallow & Farrel             Standards Track                    [Page 4]

draft-ietf-tsvwg-rsvp-user-error-spec-07.txt                  April 2008

        (sub-)organization indicated by the Enterprise Number and
        Sub Org fields of this object.

3.1. Subobjects

      Each subobject is encoded as a TLV in the following format:

      0                   1
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-------------//----------------+
     |     Type      |     Length    | (Subobject contents)          |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-------------//----------------+

     Type

        An 8-bit number assigned by the the (sub-)organization
        indicated by the Enterprise Number and Sub Org fields of the
        USER_ERROR_SPEC object.

     Length

        The Length contains the total length of the subobject in bytes,
        including the Type and Length fields.  The Length MUST be at
        least 4, and MUST be a multiple of 4.

4. Procedures for Using the User Error Spec

4.1. Procedures for Sending the User Error Spec

   A USER_ERROR_SPEC object MAY be included in any PathErr, ResvErr, or
   Notify message for any defined error code.  The Enterprise Number
   MUST be a valid value assigned by IANA from the "Enterprise Numbers"
   registry.

   As specified in [RFC2205] and [RFC3473], an ERROR_SPEC object with a
   valid error code MUST be included in all PathErr, ResvErr, and Notify
   messages.  This rule is not changed by these procedures even when a
   USER_ERROR_SPEC object is included.  If no other error code applies,
   the Error Code in the ERROR_SPEC object MUST be set to "User Error
   Spec" as defined in Section 2 of this document.  When the Error Code
   in the ERROR_SPEC object is set to "User Error Spec", the Error Value
   sub-code SHOULD be set to "Further details in User Error Spec" as
   defined in Section 2, but further Error Value sub-codes may be
   defined in future specifications.

4.2. Procedures for Receiving the User Error Spec

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementations that receive a PathErr,
   ResvErr, or Notify message carrying a USER_ERROR_SPEC object at a
   minimum log the Enterprise Number, Sub-organization, User Error

draft-ietf-tsvwg-rsvp-user-error-spec-07.txt                  April 2008


   Value, and Error Description.  Note that the Error Description is
   provided in US-ASCII which means that it might not be suitable for
   display of logging in all systems.  Implementations capable of
   interpreting the contents of the USER_ERROR_SPEC object should take
   further action based on the reported error.

   If a message is received containing an ERROR_SPEC object using the
   "User Error Spec" error code, but not containing a USER_ERROR_SPEC
   object, the message MUST be treated as malformed and handled
   according to [RFC2205].

   Implementations SHOULD ignore repeated occurences of USER_ERROR_SPEC
   objects, and SHOULD forward them unchanged on any messages that they
   forward. This provides for forward compatiblity.

   Implementations receiving a USER_ERROR_SPEC object on some message
   other than a PathErr, ResvErr, or Notify message MUST treat the
   error as a malformed message and process according to [RFC2205].

5. IANA Considerations

5.1. RSVP Error Codes

   This document makes the following assignments from the RSVP Error
   Codes and Globally-Defined Error Value Sub-Codes registry (pending
   IANA action):

        Error Code      Meaning

        <tba-xxx>       User Error Spec

   One Error Value sub-code is defined for use with this Error Code as
   follows:

         0 = Further details in User Error Spec

5.2. RSVP Objects

   This document makes the following assignments from the RSVP Class
   Names, Class Numbers, and Class Types registry (pending IANA action):

       Number Space     Value       Name

       Class Numbers    <tba-yyy>*  User Error Spec

       Class Type         1         User-Defined Error

   * Assignment is requested from the range 192 through 247

6. Security Considerations

   This document makes no changes to the basic message exchanges of
   [RFC2205] and [RFC3473].  It will result in a small increase in the
   number of error messages sent in cases where messages were previously
   silently dropped due to the lack of an appropriate error code.

   The mechanisms defined in this document may be used by
   implementations to report additional error conditions and information
   arising from security issues and attacks on the RSVP network.
