Internet-Draft     PCE Global Concurrent Optimization          July 2008


Abstract

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a network component,
   application, or node that is capable of performing path computations
   at the request of Path Computation Clients (PCCs).  The PCE is
   applied in Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineering
   (MPLS-TE) networks and in Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks to
   determine the routes of Label Switched Paths (LSPs) through the
   network.  In this context a PCC may be a Label Switching Router
   (LSR), a Network Management System (NMS), or another PCE.  The Path
   Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) is specified for
   communications between PCCs and PCEs, and between cooperating PCEs.

   When computing or re-optimizing the routes of a set of LSPs through a
   network it may be advantageous to perform bulk path computations in
   order to avoid blocking problems and to achieve more optimal network-
   wide solutions.  Such bulk optimization is termed Global Concurrent
   Optimization (GCO).  A GCO is able to simultaneously consider the
   entire topology of the network and the complete set of existing LSPs,
   and their respective constraints, and look to optimize or re-optimize
   the entire network to satisfy all constraints for all LSPs.  A GCO
   may also be applied to some subset of the LSPs in a network.  The GCO
   application is primarily a Network Management System (NMS) solution.

   While GCO is applicable to any simultaneous request for multiple LSPs
   (for example, a request for end-to-end protection), it is not
   invisaged that global concurrent reoptimization would be applied in a
   network (such as an MPLS-TE network) that contains a very large
   number of very low bandwidth or zero bandwidth LSPs since the large
   scope of the problem and the small benefit of concurrent
   reoptimization relative to single LSP reoptimization is unlikely to
   make the process worthwhile.  Further, applying global concurrent
   reoptimization in a network with a high rate of change of LSPs
   (churn) is not advised because of the likelihood that LSPs would
   change before they could be gloablly reoptimized.  Global
   reoptimization is more applicable to stable networks such as
   transport networks or those with long-term TE LSP tunnels.

   This document provides application-specific requirements and the PCEP
   extensions in support of GCO applications.

Internet-Draft     PCE Global Concurrent Optimization          July 2008


1.  Introduction

   [RFC4655] defines the Path Computation Element (PCE) based
   Architecture and explains how a PCE may compute Label Switched Paths
   (LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE)
   and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks at the request of Path
   Computation Clients (PCCs).  A PCC is shown to be any network
   component that makes such a request and may be for instance a Label
   Switching Router (LSR) or a Network Management System (NMS).  The
   PCE, itself, is shown to be located anywhere within the network, and
   may be within an LSR, an NMS or Operational Support System (OSS), or
   may be an independent network server.

   The PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) is the communication protocol
   used between PCC and PCE, and may also be used between cooperating
   PCEs.  [RFC4657] sets out generic protocol requirements for PCEP.
   Additional application-specific requirements for PCEP are defined in
   separate documents.

   This document provides a set of requirements and PCEP extensions in
   support of concurrent path computation applications.  A concurrent
   path computation is a path computation application where a set of TE
   paths are computed concurrently in order to efficiently utilize
   network resources.  The computation method involved with a concurrent
   path computation is referred to as global concurrent optimization in
   this document.  Appropriate computation algorithms to perform this
   type of optimization are out of the scope of this document.

   The Global Concurrent Optimization (GCO) application is primarily an
   NMS or a PCE Server based solution.  Owing to complex synchronization
   issues associated with GCO applications, the management based PCE
   architecture defined in section 5.5 of [RFC4655] is considered as the
   most suitable usage to support GCO application.  This does not
   preclude other architectural alternatives to support GCO application,
   but they are NOT RECOMMENDED.  For instance, GCO might be enabled by
   distributed LSRs through complex synchronization mechanisms.
   However, this approach might suffer from significant synchronization
   overhead between the PCE and each of the PCCs.  It would likely
   affect the network stability and hence significantly diminish the
   benefits of deploying PCEs.

   The need for global concurrent path computation may also arise when
   network operators need to establish a set of TE LSPs in their network
   planning process.  It is also envisioned that network operators might
   require global concurrent path computation in the event of
   catastrophic network failures, where a set of TE LSPs need to be
   optimally rerouted.  The nature of this work promote the use of such
   systems for offline processing.  Online application of this work

   should only be considered with proven empirical validation.

   As new LSPs are added or removed from the network over time, the
   global network resources become fragmented and the existing placement
   of LSPs within network no longer provides optimal use of the
   available capacity.  A global concurrent path computation is able to
   simultaneously consider the entire topology of the network and the
   complete set of existing LSPs and their respective constraints, and
   look to re-optimize the entire network to satisfy all constraints for
   all LSPs.  Alternatively, the application may consider a subset of
   the LSPs and/or a subset of the network topology.

   While GCO is applicable to any simultaneous request for multiple LSPs
   (for example, a request for end-to-end protection), it is not
   invisaged that global concurrent reoptimization would be applied in a
   network (such as an MPLS-TE network) that contains a very large
   number of very low bandwidth or zero bandwidth LSPs since the large
   scope of the problem and the small benefit of concurrent
   reoptimization relative to single LSP reoptimization is unlikely to
   make the process worthwhile.  Further, applying global concurrent
   reoptimization in a network with a high rate of change of LSPs
   (churn) is not advised because of the likelihood that LSPs would
   change before they could be gloablly reoptimized.  Global
   reoptimization is more applicable to stable networks such as
   transport networks or those with long-term TE LSP tunnels.

   As the PCE has the potential to provide solutions in all path
   computation solutions in a variety of environments and is a candidate
   for performing path computations in support of GCO.

   The main focus of this document is to highlight the PCC-PCE
   communication needs in support of a concurrent path computation
   applications and to define protocol extensions to meet those needs.

   The PCC-PCE requirements addressed herein are specific to the context
   where the PCE is a specialized PCE that is capable of performing
   computations in support of GCO.  Discovery of such capabilities might
   be desirable and could be achieved through extensions to the PCE
   discovery mechanisms [RFC4674], [RFC5088], [RFC5089], but that is out
   of the scope of this document.

   It is to be noted that Backward Recursive Path Computation (BRPC)
   [BRPC] is a multi-PCE path computation technique used to compute a
   shortest constrained inter-domain path wheres this ID specifies a
   technique where a set of path computation requests are bundled and
   send to a PCE with the objective of "optimizing" the set of computed
   paths.

2.  Terminology

   Most of the terminology used in this document is explained in
   [RFC4655].  A few key terms are repeated here for clarity.

   PCC: Path Computation Client: Any client application requesting a
   path computation to be performed by a Path Computation Element.

   PCE: Path Computation Element: An entity (component, application or
   network node) that is capable of computing a network path or route
   based on a network graph and applying computational constraints.

   TED: Traffic Engineering Database which contains the topology and
   resource information of the domain.  The TED may be fed by IGP
   extensions or potentially by other means.

   PCECP: The PCE Communication Protocol: PCECP is the generic abstract
   idea of a protocol that is used to communicate path computation
   requests a PCC to a PCE, and to return computed paths from the PCE to
   the PCC.  The PCECP can also be used between cooperating PCEs.

   PCEP: The PCE communication Protocol: PCEP is the actual protocol
   that implements the PCECP idea.

   GCO: Global Concurrent Optimization: A concurrent path computation
   application where a set of TE paths are computed concurrently in
   order to efficiently utilize network resources.  A GCO path
   computation is able to simultaneously consider the entire topology of
   the network and the complete set of existing LSPs, and their
   respective constraints, and look to optimize or re-optimize the
   entire network to satisfy all constraints for all LSPs.  A GCO path
   computation can also provide an optimal way to migrate from an
   existing set of LSPs to a reoptimized set (Morphing Problem).

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].
   These terms are also used in the parts of this document that specify
   requirements for clarity of specification of those requirements.

3.  Applicability of Global Concurrent Optimization (GCO)

   This section discusses the PCE architecture to which GCO is applied.
   It also discusses various application scenarios for which global
   concurrent path computation may be applied.

3.1.  Application of the PCE Architecture

   Figure 1 shows the PCE-based network architecture as defined in
   [RFC4655] to which GCO application is applied.  It must be observed
   that the PCC is not necessarily an LSR [RFC4655].  The GCO
   application is primarily an NMS-based solution in which an NMS plays
   the function of the PCC.  Although Figure 1 shows the PCE as remote
   from the NMS, it might be collocated with the NMS.  Note that in the
   collocated case there is no need for a standard communication
   protocol; this can rely on internal APIs.

                |  Node    |<---------->|   Node   |
                 ----------              ----------




    Figure 1: PCE-Based Architecture for Global Concurrent Optimization

   Upon receipt of an application request (e.g., a traffic demand matrix
   is provided to the NMS by the operator's network planning procedure),
   the NMS requests a global concurrent path computation from the PCE.
   The PCE then computes the requested paths concurrently applying some
   algorithms.  Various algorithms and computation techniques have been
   proposed to perform this function.  Specification of such algorithms



Lee, et al.             Expires January 15, 2009                [Page 7]

   or techniques is outside the scope of this document.

   When the requested path computation completes, the PCE sends the
   resulting paths back to the NMS.  The NMS then supplies the head-end
   LSRs with a fully computed explicit path for each TE LSP that needs
   to be established.

3.2.  Greenfield Optimization

   Greenfield optimization is a special case of GCO application when
   there are no LSPs already set up in the network.  The need for
   greenfield optimization arises when network planner wants to make use
   of a computation server to plan the LSPs that will be provisioned in
   the network.

   When a new TE network needs to be provisioned from a greenfield
   perspective, a set of TE LSPs needs to be created based on traffic
   demand, network topology, service constraints, and network resources.
   In this scenario, the ability to perform concurrent computation is
   desirable, or required, to utilize network resources in an optimal
   manner and avoid blocking.

3.2.1.  Single-layer Traffic Engineering

   Greenfield optimization can be applied when layer-specific TE LSPs
   need to be created from a greenfield perspective.  For example, an
   MPLS-TE network can be planned based on layer 3 specific traffic
   demands, the network topology, and available network resources.
   Greenfield optimization for single-layer traffic engineering can be
   applied to optical transport networks such as SDH/Sonet, Ethernet
   Transport, WDM, etc.

3.2.2.  Multi-layer Traffic Engineering

   Greenfield optimization is not limited to single-layer traffic
   engineering.  It can also be applied to multi-layer traffic
   engineering [PCE-MLN].  Both the client and the server layers network
   resources and topology can be considered simultaneously in setting up
   a set of TE LSPs that traverse the layer boundary.

3.3.  Re-optimization of Existing Networks

   The need for global concurrent path computation may arise in existing
   networks.  When an existing TE LSP network experiences sub-optimal
   use of its resources, the need for re-optimization or reconfiguration
   may arise.  The scope of re-optimization and reconfiguration may vary
   depending on particular situations.  The scope of re-optimization may
   be limited to bandwidth modification to an existing TE LSP.  However,



Lee, et al.             Expires January 15, 2009                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft     PCE Global Concurrent Optimization          July 2008


   it could well be that a set of TE LSPs may need to be re-optimized
   concurrently.  In an extreme case, the TE LSPs may need to be
   globally re-optimized.

   In loaded networks, with large size LSPs, a sequential re-
   optimization may not produce substantial improvements in terms of
   overall network optimization.  Sequential re-optimization refers to a
   path computation method in which to compute the re-optimized path of
   one LSP at a time without giving any consideration to the other LSPs
   that need to be re-optimized in the network.  The potential for
   network-wide gains from reoptimization of LSPs sequentially is
   dependent upon the network usage and size of the LSPs being
   optimized.  However, the key point remains: computing the reoptimized
   path of one LSP at a time without giving any consideration to the
   other LSPs in the network could result in sub-optimal use of network
   resources.  This may be far more visible in an optical network with a
   low ratio of potential LSPs per link, and far less visible in packet
   networks with micro-flow LSPs.

   With regards to applicability of GCO in the event of catastrophic
   failures, there may be a real benefit in computing the paths of the
   LSPs as a set rather than computing new paths from the head-end LSRs
   in a distributed manner.  GCO could prevent race condition (i.e.,
   competing for the same resource from different head-end LSRs) that
   may be associated with a distributed computation.  However, a
   centralized system will typically suffer from a slower response time
   than a distributed system.

3.3.1.  Reconfiguration of the Virtual Network Topology (VNT)

   Reconfiguration of the VNT [MLN-REQ] [PCE-MLN] is a typical
   application scenario where global concurrent path computation may be
   applicable.  Triggers for VNT reconfiguration, such as traffic demand
   changes, network failures, and topological configuration changes, may
   require a set of existing LSPs to be re-computed.

3.3.2.  Traffic Migration

   When migrating from one set of TE LSPs to a reoptimized set of TE
   LSPs it is important that the traffic be moved without causing
   disruption.  Various techniques exist in MPLS and GMPLS, such as
   make-before-break [RFC3209], to establish the new LSPs before tearing
   down the old LSPs.  When multiple LSP routes are changed according to
   the computed results, some of the LSPs may be disrupted due to the
   resource constraints.  In other words, it may prove to be impossible
   to perform a direct migration from the old LSPs to the new optimal
   LSPs without disrupting traffic because there are insufficient
   network resources to support both sets of LSPs when make-before-break



Lee, et al.             Expires January 15, 2009                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft     PCE Global Concurrent Optimization          July 2008


   is used.  However, a PCE may be able to determine a sequence of make-
   before- break replacement of individual LSPs or small sets of LSPs so
   that the full set of LSPs can be migrated without any disruption.

   It may be the case that the reoptimization is radical.  This could
   mean that it is not possible to apply make-before-break in any order
   to migrate from the old LSPs to the new LSPs.  In this case a
   migration strategy is required that may necessitate LSPs being
   rerouted using make-before-break onto temporary paths in order to
   make space for the full reoptimization.  A PCE might indicate the
   order in which reoptimized LSPs must be established and take over
   from the old LSPs, and may indicate a series of different temporary
   paths that must be used.  Alternatively, the PCE might perform the
   global reoptimization as a series of sub-reoptimizations by
   reoptimizing subsets of the total set of LSPs.

   The benefit of this multi-step rerouting includes minimization of
   traffic discruption and optimization gain.  However this approach may
   imply some transient packets desequencing, jitter as well as control
   plane stress.

   Note also that during reoptimization, traffic disruption may be
   allowed for some LSPs carrying low priority services (e.g., Internet
   traffic) and not allowed for some LSPs carrying mission critical
   services (e.g., voice traffic).

4.  PCECP Requirements

   This section provides the PCECP requirements to support global
   concurrent path computation applications.  The requirements specified
   here should be regarded as application-specific requirements and are
   justifiable based on the extensibility clause found in section 6.1.14
   of [RFC4657]:

      The PCECP MUST support the requirements specified in the
      application-specific requirements documents.  The PCECP MUST also
      allow extensions as more PCE applications will be introduced in
      the future.

   It is also to be noted that some of the requirements discussed in
   this section have already been discussed in the PCECP requirement
   document [RFC4657].  For example, Section 5.1.16 in [RFC4657]
   provides a list of generic constraints while Section 5.1.17 in
   [RFC4657] provides a list of generic objective functions that MUST be
   supported by the PCECP.  While using such generic requirements as the
   baseline, this section provides application-specific requirements in
   the context of global concurrent path computation and in a more
   detailed level than the generic requirements.

   The PCEP SHOULD support the following capabilities either via
   creation of new objects and/or modification of existing objects where
   applicable.

   o  An indicator to convey that the request is for a global concurrent
      path computation.  This indicator is necessary to ensure
      consistency in applying global objectives and global constraints
      in all path computations.  Note: This requirement is covered by
      "synchronized path computation" in [RFC4655] and [RFC4657].
      However, an explicit indicator to request a global concurrent
      optimization is a new requirement.

   o  A Global Objective Function (GOF) field in which to specify the
      global objective function.  The global objective function is the
      overarching objective function to which all individual path
      computation requests are subjected in order to find a globally
      optimal solution.  Note that this requirement is covered by
      "synchronized objective functions" in section 5.1.7 [RFC4657] and
      that [PCE-OF] defined three global objective functions as follows.
      A list of available global objective functions SHOULD include the
      following objective functions at the minimum and SHOULD be
      expandable for future addition:

      *  Minimize aggregate Bandwidth Consumption (MBC)

Internet-Draft     PCE Global Concurrent Optimization          July 2008


      *  Minimize the load of the Most Loaded Link (MLL)

      *  Minimize Cumulative Cost of a set of paths (MCC)

   o  A Global Constraints (GC) field in which to specify the list of
      global constraints to which all the requested path computations
      should be subjected.  This list SHOULD include the following
      constraints at the minimum and SHOULD be expandable for future
      addition:

      *  Maximum link utilization value -- This value indicates the
         highest possible link utilization percentage set for each link.
         (Note: to avoid floating point numbers, the values should be
         integer values.)

      *  Minimum link utilization value -- This value indicates the
         lowest possible link utilization percentage set for each link.
         (Note: same as above)

      *  Overbooking Factor -- The overbooking factor allows the
         reserved bandwidth to be overbooked on each link beyond its
         physical capacity limit.

      *  Maximum number of hops for all the LSPs -- This is the largest
         number of hops that any LSP can have.  Note that this
         constraint can also be provided on a per LSP basis (as
         requested in [RFC4657] and defined in [PCEP]).

      *  Exclusion of links/nodes in all LSP path computation (i.e., all
         LSPs should not include the specified links/nodes in their
         paths).  Note that this constraint can also be provided on a
         per LSP basis (as requested in [RFC4657] and defined in
         [PCEP]).

      *  An indication should be available in a path computation
         response that further reoptimization may only become available
         once existing traffic has been moved to the new LSPs.

   o  A Global Concurrent Vector (GCV) field in which to specify all the
      individual path computation requests that are subject to
      concurrent path computation and subject to the global objective
      function and all of the global constraints.  Note that this
      requirement is entirely fulfilled by the SVEC object in the PCEP
      specification [PCEP].  Since the SVEC object as defined in [PCEP]
      allows identifying a set of concurrent path requests, the SVEC can
      be reused to specify all the individual concurrent path requests
      for a global concurrent optimization.

Internet-Draft     PCE Global Concurrent Optimization          July 2008


   o  An indicator field in which to indicate the outcome of the
      request.  When the PCE cannot find a feasible solution with the
      initial request, the reason for failure SHOULD be indicated.  This
      requirement is partially covered by [RFC4657], but not in this
      level of detail.  The following indicators SHOULD be supported at
      the minimum:

      *  no feasible solution found.  Note that this is already covered
         in [PCEP].

      *  memory overflow

      *  PCE too busy.  Note that this is already covered in [PCEP].

      *  PCE not capable of concurrent reoptimization

      *  no migration path available

      *  administrative privileges do not allow global reoptimization

   o  In order to minimize disruption associated with bulk path
      provisioning, the following requirements MUST be supported:

      *  The request message MUST allow requesting the PCE to provide
         the order in which LSPs should be reoptimized (i.e., the
         migration path) in order to minimize traffic disruption during
         the migration.  That is the request message MUST allow
         indicating to the PCE that the set of paths that will be
         provided in the response message (PCRep) has to be ordered.

      *  In response to the "ordering" request from the PCC, the PCE
         MUST be able to indicate in the response message (PCRep) the
         order in which LSPs should be reoptimized so as to minimize
         traffic disruption.  It should indicate for each request the
         order in which the old LSP should be removed and the order in
         which the new LSP should be setup.  If the removal order is
         lower than the setup order this means that make-before-break
         cannot be done for this request.  It MAY also be desirable to
         have the PCE indicate whether ordering is in fact required or
         not.

      *  As stated in RFC 4657, the request for a reoptimization MUST
         support the inclusion of the set of previously computed paths
         along with their bandwidth.  This is to avoid double bandwidth
         accounting and also this allows running an algorithm that
         minimizes perturbation and that can compute a migration path
         (LSP setup/removal orders).  This is particularly required for
         stateless PCEs.

      *  During a migration it may not be possible to do a make-before-
         break for all existing LSPs.  The request message MUST allow
         indicating for each request whether make-before-break is
         required (e.g.  Voice traffic) or break-before-make is
         acceptable (e.g.  Internet traffic).  The response message must
         allow indicating LSPs for which make-before-break
         reoptimization is not possible (this will be deduced from the
         LSP setup and deletion orders).

5.  Protocol Extensions for Support of Global Concurrent Optimization

   This section provides protocol extensions for support of global
   concurrent optimization.  Protocol extensions discussed in this
   section are built on [PCEP].

   The format of a PCReq message after incorporating new requirements
   for support of global concurrent optimization is as follows:


   <PCReq Message>::=<Common Header>
                      [<SVEC-list>]
                      <request-list>

   The <SVEC-list> is changed as follows:

   <SVEC-list>:: =<SVEC>
                  [<OF>]
                  [<GC>]
                  [<XRO>]
                  [<SVEC-list>]


   Note that three optional objects are added, following the SVEC
   object: the OF (Objective Function) object, which is defined in
   [PCE-OF], the GC (Global Constraints) object, which is defined in
   this document (section 5.5), as well as the eXclude Route Object
   (XRO) which is defined in [PCE-XRO].  The placement of the OF object
   (in which the global objective function is specified) in the SVEC-
   list is defined in [PCE-OF].  Details of this change will be
   discussed in the following sections.

   Note also that when the XRO is global to a SVEC, and F bit is set, it
   SHOULD be allowed to specify multiple Reported Route Objects (RROs)
   in the PCReq message.

5.1.  Global Objective Function (GOF) Specification

   The global objective function can be specified in the PCEP Objective
   Function (OF) object, defined in [PCE-OF].  The OF object includes a
   16 bit Objective Function identifier.  As per discussed in [PCE-OF],
   objective function identifier code points are managed by IANA.

   Three global objective functions defined in [PCE-OF] are used in the
   context of GCO.

Internet-Draft     PCE Global Concurrent Optimization          July 2008


   Function
   Code            Description

   4               Minimize aggregate Bandwidth Consumption (MBC)

   5       Minimize the load of the Most Loaded Link (MLL)*

   6       Minimize Cumulative Cost of a set of paths (MCC)


   * Note: This can be achieved by the following objective function:
   minimize max over all links {(C(i)-A(i))/C(i)} where C(i) is the link
   capacity for link i and A(i) is the total bandwidth allocated on link
   i.

5.2.  Indication of Global Concurrent Optimization Requests

   All the path requests in this application should be indicated so that
   the global objective function and all of the global constraints are
   applied to each of the requested path computation.  This can be
   indicated implicitly by placing the GCO related objects (GOF, GC or
   XRO) after the SVEC object.  That is, if any of these objects follows
   the SVEC object in the PCReq message, all of the requested path
   computations specified in the SVEC object are subject to GOF, GC or
   XRO.

5.3.  Request for The Order of LSP

   In order to minimize disruption associated with bulk path
   provisioning, the PCC may indicate to the PCE that the response MUST
   be ordered.  That is, the PCE has to include the order in which LSPs
   MUST be moved so as to minimize traffic disruption.  To support such
   indication a new flag, the D flag, is defined in the RP object as
   follows:

   D bit (orDer - 1 bit): when set, in a PCReq message, the requesting
   PCC requires the PCE to specify in the PCRep message the order in
   which this particular path request is to be provisioned relative to
   other requests.

   To support the determination of whether make-before-break
   optimization is required, a new flag, the M flag, is defined in the
   RP object as follows.

   M bit (Make-before-break - 1 bit): when set, this indicates that a
   make-before-break reoptimization is required for this request.

   When M bit is not set, this implies that a break-before-make



Lee, et al.             Expires January 15, 2009               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft     PCE Global Concurrent Optimization          July 2008


   reoptimization is allowed for this request.  Note that M bit can be
   set only if the R (Reoptimization) flag is set.

5.4.  The Order Response

   The PCE MUST specify the order number in response to the Order
   Request made by the PCC in the PCReq message if so requested by the
   setting of the D bit in the RP object in the PCReq message.  To
   support such ordering indication a new optional TLV, the Order TLV,
   is defined in the RP object.

   The Order TLV is an optional TLV in the RP object, that indicates the
   order in which the old LSP must be removed and the new LSP must be
   setup during a reoptimization.  It is carried in the PCRep message in
   response to a reoptimization request.

   The Order TLV SHOULD be included in the RP object in the PCRep
   message if the D bit is set in the RP object in the PCReq message.

   The format of the Order TLV is as follows:



       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

       |                          Delete Order                         |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                           Setup Order                         |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Delete Order: 32 bit integer that indicates the order in which the
   old LSP should be removed

   LSP should be setup

   The delete order SHOULD not be equal to the setup order.  If the

Internet-Draft     PCE Global Concurrent Optimization          July 2008


   delete order is higher than the setup order, this means that the
   reoptimization can be done in a make-before-break manner, else it
   cannot be done in a make-before-break manner.

   For a new LSP the delete order is not applicable.  The value 0 is
   designated to specify this case.  When the value of the delete order
   is 0, it implies that the resulting LSP is a new LSP.

   To illustrate this, consider a network with two established LSPs: R1
   with path P1 and R2 with path P2.  During a reoptimization the PCE
   may provide the following ordered reply:

   R1, path P1', remove order 1, setup order 4
   R2, path P2', remove order 3, setup order 2

   This indicates that the NMS should do the following sequence of
   tasks:

   1: Remove path P1
   2: Setup path P2'
   3: Remove path P2
   4: Setup path P1'

   That is, R1 is reoptimized in a break-before-make manner and R2 in a
   make-before-break manner.

5.5.  GLOBAL CONSTRAINTS (GC) Object

   The GLOBAL CONSTRAINTS (GC) Object is used in a PCReq message to
   specify the necessary global constraints that should be applied to
   all individual path computations for a global concurrent path
   optimization request.

   GLOBAL CONSTRAINTS Object-Class is to be assigned by IANA
   (recommended value=24)

   GLOBAL CONSTRAINTS Object-Type is to be assigned by IANA (recommended
   value=1)

   The format of the GC object body that includes the global constraints
   is as follows:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                      Figure 3: GC body object format

   MH (Max Hop: 8 bits): 8 bit integer that indicates the maximum hop
   count for all the LSPs.

   MU (Max Utilization Percentage: 8 bits) : 8 bits integer that
   indicates the upper bound utilization percentage by which all link
   should be bound.  Utilization = (Link Capacity - Allocated Bandwidth
   on the Link)/ Link Capacity

   mU (minimum Utilization Percentage: 8 bits) : 8 bits integer that
   indicates the lower bound utilization percentage by which all link
   should be bound.

   OB (Over Booking factor Percentage: 8 bits) : 8 bits integer that
   indicates the overbooking percentage that allows the reserved
   bandwidth to be overbooked on each link beyond its physical capacity
   limit.  The value, for example, 10% means that 110 Mbps can be
   reserved on a 100Mbps link.

   Reserved bits (24 bits) of the GLOBAL CONSTRAINTS Object SHOULD be
   transmitted as zero and SHOULD be ignored upon receipt.

   The exclusion of the list of nodes/links from a global path
   computation can be done by including the XRO object following the GC
   object in the new SVEC list definition.

5.6.  Error Indicator

   To indicate errors associated with the global concurrent path
   optimization request, a new Error-Type (14) and subsequent error-
   values are defined as follows for inclusion in the PCEP-ERROR object:

   A new Error-Type (15) and subsequent error-values are defined as
   follows:

   Error-Type=15 and Error-Value=1: if a PCE receives a global

Internet-Draft     PCE Global Concurrent Optimization          July 2008


   concurrent path optimization request and the PCE is not capable of
   processing the request due to insufficient memory, the PCE MUST send
   a PCErr message with a PCEP ERROR object (Error-Type=15) and an
   Error-Value (Error-Value=1).  The PCE stops processing the request.
   The corresponding global concurrent path optimization request MUST be
   cancelled at the PCC.

   Error-Type=15; Error-Value=2: if a PCE receives a global concurrent
   path optimization request and the PCE is not capable of global
   concurrent optimization, the PCE MUST send a PCErr message with a
   PCEP-ERROR Object (Error-Type=15) and an Error-Value (Error-Value=2).
   The PCE stops processing the request.  The corresponding global
   concurrent path optimization MUST be cancelled at the PCC.

   To indicate an error associated with policy violation, a new error
   value "global concurrent optimization not allowed" should be added to
   an existing error code for policy violation (Error-Type=5) as defined
   in [PCEP].

   Error-Type=5; Error-Value=5: if a PCE receives a global concurrent
   path optimization request which is not compliant with administrative
   privileges (i.e., the PCE policy does not support global concurrent
   optimization), the PCE sends a PCErr message with a PCEP-ERROR Object
   (Error-Type=5) and an Error-Value (Error-Value=5).  The PCE stops the
   processing the request.  The corresponding global concurrent path
   computation MUST be cancelled at the PCC.

5.7.  NO-PATH Indicator

   To communicate the reason(s) for not being able to find global
   concurrent path computation, the NO-PATH object can be used in the
   PCRep message.  The format of the NO-PATH object body is defined in
   [PCEP].  The object may contain a NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV to provide
   additional information about why a path computation has failed.

   Two new bit flags are defined to be carried in the Flags field in the
   NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV carried in the NO-PATH Object.

   Bit 6: When set, the PCE indicates that no migration path was found.

   Bit 7: When set, the PCE indicates no feasible solution was found
   that meets all the constraints associated with global concurrent path
   optimization in the PCRep message.

6.  Manageability Considerations

   Manageability of Global Concurrent Path Computation with PCE must
   address the following considerations:

6.1.  Control of Function and Policy

   In addition to the parameters already listed in section 8.1 of
   [PCEP], a PCEP implementation SHOULD allow configuring the following
   PCEP session parameters on a PCC:

   o  The ability to send a GCO request.

   In addition to the parameters already listed in section 8.1 of
   [PCEP], a PCEP implementation SHOULD allow configuring the following
   PCEP session parameters on a PCE:

   o  The support for Global Concurrent Optimization.

   o  The maximum number of synchronized path requests per request
      message.

   o  A set of GCO specific policies (authorized sender, request rate
      limiter, etc).

   These parameters may be configured as default parameters for any PCEP
   session the PCEP speaker participates in, or may apply to a specific
   session with a given PCEP peer or a specific group of sessions with a
   specific group of PCEP peers.

6.2.  Information and Data Models, e.g. MIB module

   Extensions to the PCEP MIB module defined in [PCEP-MIB] should be
   defined, so as to cover the GCO information introduced in this
   document.

6.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   Mechanisms defined in this draft does not imply any new liveness
   detection and monitoring requirements in addition to those already
   listed in section 8.3 of [PCEP].

6.4.  Verifying Correct Operation

   Mechanisms defined in this draft do not imply any new verification
   requirements in addition to those already listed in section 8.4 of
   [PCEP]

6.5.  Requirements on Other Protocols and Functional Components

   The PCE Discovery mechanisms ([RFC 5088] and [RFC 5089]) may be used
   to advertise global concurrent path computation capabilities to PCCs.

6.6.  Impact on Network Operation

   Mechanisms defined in this draft do not imply any new network

7.  Security Considerations

   When global re-optimization is applied to an active network, it could
   be extremely disruptive.  Although the real security and policy
   issues apply at the NMS, if the wrong results are returned to the
   NMS, the wrong actions may be taken in the network.  Therefore, it is
   very important that the operator issuing the commands has sufficient
   authority and is authenticated, and that the computation request is
   subject to appropriate policy.

   The mechanism defined in [PCEP] to secure a PCEP session can be used
   to secure global concurrent path computation requests/responses.

9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains a registry of PCEP parameters.  IANA is requested to
   make allocations from the sub-registries as described in the
   following sections.

9.1.  Request Parameter Bit Flags

   As described in Section 5.3, two new bit lfags are defined for
   inclusion in the Flags field of the RP object.  IANA is requested to
   make the following allocations from the "Request Parameter Bit Flags"
   sub-registry.


   Bit      Name    Description                    Reference

   11       D-bit   Report the request order       [This.I-D]
   12       M-bit   Make-before-break              [This.I-D]


9.2.  New PCEP TLV

   As described in Section 5.4, a new PCEP TLV is defined to indicate
   the setup and delete order of LSPs in a GCO.  IANA is requested to
   make the following allocation from the "PCEP TLV Types" sub-registry.


   TLV Type        Meaning                 Reference

   5               Order TLV               [This.I-D]


9.3.  New PCEP Object

   As descried in Section 5.5, a new PCEP object is defined to carry
   global constraints.  IANA is requested to make the following
   allocation from the "PCEP Objects" sub-registry.


   Object  Name                                            Reference
   Class

   24              GLOBAL-CONSTRAINTS                      [This.I-D]
                       Object-Type
                      1: Global Constraints                [This.I-D]

9.4.  New PCEP Error Codes

   As described in Section 5.6, new PCEP error codes are defined for GCO
   errors.  IANA is requested to make allocations from the "PCEP Error
   Types and Values" sub-registry as set out in the following sections.

9.4.1.  New Error-Values for Existing Error-Types


   Error
   Type    Meaning                                            Reference

   5               Policy violation
                           Error-value=5:                     [This.I-D]
                   Global concurrent optimization not allowed


9.4.2.  New Error-Types and Error-Values


   Error
   Type    Meaning                                            Reference

   15              Global Concurrent Optimization Error       [This.I-D]
                   Error-value=1:
                   Insufficient memory                        [This.I-D]
                   Error-value=2:
                   Global concurrent optimization not supported
                                                              [This.I-D]


9.5.  New No-Path Reasons

   IANA is requested to make the following allocations from the "No-Path
   Reasons" sub-registry for bit flags carried in the NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV
   in the PCEP NO-PATH object as described in Section 5.7.

   Bit
   Number          Name                         Reference

   6               No GCO migration path found  [This.I-D]
