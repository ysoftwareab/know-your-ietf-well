     Abstract 

         In delayed authentication in DHCPv6[RFC3315], the hardware 
        identifier is used to select the key, and the key is exchanged 
        between the server and the client in advance. Therefore, when a user 
        tries to use a new device, it is necessary to add key information to 
        the new device and DHCPv6 servers.  
         In this document, we propose a procedure for introducing 
        CHAP[RFC1994] into the DHCPv6 authentication procedure. This 
        procedure allows the client get the host configuration information

    1. Introduction 

        In delayed authentication, which is the authentication procedure 
       described in RFC3315, the hardware identifier, such as the MAC 
       address, is used to select the key, and it is assumed that the key is 
       exchanged between the server and the client in advance. Therefore, 
       when a user tries to use a new device, it is necessary to submit new 
       hardware identifiers and new key information to the DHCPv6 server. We 
       think that it will be deployment issue. 
      
          To avoid this problem, we propose a user based authentication 
        procedure. In this procedure, DHCPv6 server authenticates user using 
        CHAP mechanism during solicitation procedure. To identify users, we 
        assumed that user identifier, such as FQDN of user, is used as 
        identifier of peer. And shared secret, which is used to establish 
        security association between DHCPv6 client and server for subsequent 
        sequences, is exchanged using Diffie-Hellman mechanism.  
           
    2. Issues 

        In the Delayed Authentication procedure, the DHCPv6 server selects a 
        key based on the hardware identifier of the DHCPv6 client, such as 
        MAC address, and it is assumed that keys are exchanged between the 
        server and the client in advance. Therefore, when a user tries to use 
        a new device, it is necessary to add the key to the new device and 
        DHCPv6 servers. We think that there will be the following deployment 
        issues:  

        -The user is required to submit a new hardware identifier and a new 
        key to the operator of the DHCPv6 server. 

        The original purpose of DHCPv6 authentication was to avoid server 
        and client spoofing in general environments such as a LAN, so the 
        DHCPv6 authentication procedure is required to provide mutual 
        authentication. On the other hand, we can assume that nobody can 
        spoof the DHCPv6 server in a commercial network. In such a network, 
        we think that it is unnecessary for the client to authenticate the 
        server. A network access authentication procedure, such as CHAP, is 
        one of the major one-way authentication procedures. A lot of network 
        access procedures use the user identifier to select a secret. 
        Therefore, an AAA server is required to manage one secret per user 
        even if users change terminal.

     Internet-Draft   CHAP based authentication for DHCPv6         June 2005 
         

        Therefore, we propose a new authentication procedure that applies an 
        access authentication method based on the user identifier to the 
        DHCPv6 authentication procedure.   

    3. Protocol Overview 

        Here, we introduce a new authentication procedure that uses CHAP as 
        the authentication method. This procedure allows the server to 
        execute authentication based on the user identifier. We call it the 
        CHAP-based Authentication Procedure. An example sequence of this 
        procedure is illustrated in Figure 1. 
        When the DHCPv6 server receives a Solicit message, the server 
        replies with the Advertise message, which carries the challenge and 
        identifier. The client calculates the Response value using the 
        challenge and a pre-shared secret such as a password. And the client 
        sends a Request message with the user-identifier, identifier, and 
        Response value. When the DHCPv6 server receives a Request message, it 
        selects a challenge based on the identifier. The DHCPv6 server may 
        send an authentication request message to the AAA server, and the AAA 
        server selects a secret based on the user identifier and evaluates 
        the Response value. But the protocol between the DHCPv6 server and 
        the AAA server is out of our scope. If the evaluation has been 
        completed successfully, the DHCPv6 server sends a Reply message to 
        the DHCPv6 client.

    4. Packet Format of the Authentication Option in the CHAP-based 
       Authentication Procedure 

        In a Solicit message, the client fills in the protocol, algorithm, 
        and RDM fields in the Authentication option with the clientÆs 
        preferences. The client sets the replay detection field to zero and 
        omits the authentication information field. The client sets the 
        option-len field to 11. 
         
        In all other messages, the protocol and algorithm fields identify 
        the procedure used to construct the contents of the authentication 
        information field. The RDM field identifies the procedure used to 
        construct the contents of the replay detection field. 
         
        The format of the Authentication information for CHAP-based 
        authentication procedure is: 
         
         0                   1                   2                   3

                         The MSG TYPE identifies the type of message.  
                          We set the following types. 
                          1 Challenge 
                          2 Response 
                          3 Success 
                          4 Failure 
           
          Identifier      The Identifier shows that it is a series of 
                          a CHAP sequence. When a Challenge value is 
                          generated, the identifier is generated at  
                          random by DHCPv6 Server.

        MSG TYPE field is 2 (Response). Identifier is the same as the one 
        included in the Advertise message. This authentication information 
        has two attributes: Type (1) and Type (3). The attribute Type 1 is 
        filled with User-Name@domain, which the client has beforehand. The 
        attribute Type 3 is filled with Response value, which is calculated 
        by the client. The attribute Type 80 is filled with DH-group value. 
        The attribute Type 81 is filled with public key value generated by 
        the client, which uses to calculate secret key with the server.

     4.3. Authentication Information in Reply Messages corresponding to 
        Request Message 

        The server selects authentication information included in the Reply 
        message according to the authentication information received from the 
        AAA server. When the server receives the message of authentication 
        success, it sends a Reply message containing authentication 
        information with the MSG_TYPE field set to 3 (Success). The attribute 
        Type 80 is filled with DH-group value. The attribute Type 81 is 
        filled with public key value generated by the server, which uses to 
        calculate secret key by the client. Additionally, the message 
        includes other necessary information (DHCP realm, key ID, life time 
        of the key).

     Internet-Draft   CHAP based authentication for DHCPv6         June 2005 
         

    5. Client and Server Considerations  

     5.1. Client Considerations 

        The client announces its intention to use DHCPv6 authentication by 
        including an authentication option in its Solicit message.  
         
     5.1.1. Sending Solicit Messages 

        When the client demands to authenticate, a Solicit message includes 
        an authentication option with the desired protocol, algorithm, and 
        RDM. The client does not include any replay detection or 
        authentication information in the authentication option.  

     5.1.2. Receiving Advertise Messages 

        The client validates Advertise messages. If the Advertise messages 
        have a Challenge value in the authentication information field, the 
        client generates a Response value by applying MD5 to the data 
        connecting Identifier, the secret that the client has beforehand, and 
        the Challenge value. 
         
     5.1.3. Sending Request Messages 

        The client sends a Request message with User-Name as the user 
        identifier, Identifier, Response value, DH-group, and KeyExchange 
        attribute in the authentication information fields. A public key 
        value in KeyExchange attribute is calculated by the client using DH-
        group which received in Advertise message. 
         
     5.1.4. Sending Confirm, Renew, Rebind, Decline or Release Messages  

        If the client received Reply messages before, it can send Confirm, 
        Renew, Decline or Release Messages with authentication information 
        using generated key. In this time, the client follows the sequence at 
        section 21.4.4.3 in RFC3315. It is different only to put put the 
        number of this authentication in the protocol field in the 
        Authentication option. 
         
     5.1.5. Sending Information-Request Messages  

        In this document, we support only stateful DHCP. Because, this 
        procedure assumes use to the situation which is disbursed the address 
        to the client, and managed by the server. The client follows the 
        sequence at section 21.4.4.3 in RFC3315 using the secret key which 
        the client gets in section 5.1.6. It is different only to put put the

        number of this authentication in the protocol field in the 
        Authentication option. 
         
     5.1.6. Receiving Reply Messages  

        If the messages which client received include "Success" in 
        authentication information, the client draws the public key value in 
        KeyExchange Attribute. And the client calculates secret key by 
        Diffie-Hellman algorism. 
         
     5.1.1. Receiving Reconfigure Messages  

        The client follows the sequence at section 21.4.4.6 in RFC3315. It is 
        different only to put put the number of this authentication in the 
        protocol field in the Authentication option. 
         
     5.1.2. When the key life time is over  

        The client sends Solicit Message and start solicitation procedure to 
        exchange new secret key. It is different only to put put the number 
        of this authentication in the protocol field in the Authentication 
        option. 
         
     5.2. Server Considerations 

     5.2.1. Receiving Solicit Messages and Sending Advertise Messages 

        A server that receives a Solicit message with the protocol field set 
        to CHAP-based authentication procedure value generates a Challenge 
        value and Identifier. The server sends them with Advertise Messages. 
        The server MUST record the identifier related to the Challenge value 
        during the authentication procedure.  
         
     5.2.2. Receiving Request Messages and Sending Reply Messages 

        If the Request message includes authentication option which type is 
        set with CHAP Authentication, the receiving server chooses a 
        Challenge value related to the Identifier and sends the User-Name, 
        Identifier, Challenge value, and Response value to the AAA server. 
        After the server has received the authentication result from the AAA 
        server, it sends the client a Reply message containing the 
        authentication option, which includes success or failure in MSG TYPE 
        and KeyExchange attribute which include public key value generated by 
        the server and other information. And the server get secret key of 
        the client calculated by received public key value from the client.

     5.2.3. Receiving Confirm, Renew, Rebind, Decline or Release Messages  

        The client follows the sequence at section 21.4.5.2 in RFC3315. It 
        is different only to put put the number of this authentication in the 
        protocol field in the Authentication option. 
         
     5.2.4. Sending Reply Messages in Information-Request/Reply sequence 

        The client follows the sequence at section 21.4.5.2 in RFC3315. It 
        is different only to put put the number of this authentication in the 
        protocol field in the Authentication option. 
         
    6. Security Considerations  

        The CHAP-based authentication procedure gives the procedure for 
       authenticating the client. This protocol does not give the means of 
       server authentication, so it has a weakness in terms of clarifying 
       the server. 
         

    7. IANA Consideration 

        This document introduces a new authentication mechanism. The type 
        numbers for the protocol field in the authentication option are 
        currently TBD. An appropriate request will be made to IANA if this 
        Internet draft gets accepted as an RFC.
