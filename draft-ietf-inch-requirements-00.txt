        The purpose of the Format for INcident report Exchange (FINE) is to 
        facilitate the exchange of incident information and statistics among 
        responsible Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) and 
        involved parties for reactionary analysis of current intruder 
        activity and proactive identification of trends that can lead to 
        incident prevention.  A common and well-defined format will help in 
        exchanging, retrieving and archiving Incident Reports across 
        organizations, regions and countries.

     1. Introduction 
      
        Computer security incidents occur across administrative domains 
        often spanning different organizations and national borders. 
        Therefore, the exchange of incident information and statistics among 
        involved parties and the responsible Computer Security Incident 
        Response Teams (CSIRTs) is crucial for both reactionary analysis of 
        current intruder activity and proactive identification of trends 
        that can lead to incident prevention. 
         
        In the following we refer to the information pertaining to an 
        incident as an Incident Report. Actually Incident Report created and 
        handled by CSIRT may have internal proprietary format that is 
        adopted to local Incident handling procedure and used Incident 
        Handling System (IHS). It is intended that exchange of Incident 
        information will be conducted in a common format referred in this 
        document as Format for INcident report Exchange (FINE). 
         
        This document defines the high-level functional requirements to the 
        FINE intended to facilitate collaboration between CSIRTs and parties 
        involved when handling computer security incidents. 
         
      
     2. Incident Handling Framework 
         
        2.1. Incident Description Terms

     INTERNET DRAFT            FINE Requirements            February, 2003 

        A definition of the main terms used in the rest of document is given 
        for clarity. 
         
        Where possible, existing definitions will be used; some definitions 
        will need additional detail and further consideration. Currently 
        proposed definitions are based on well-known in the CSIRT community 
        documents [7, 8, 9, 10]. 
         
        2.1.1. Attack 
         
        An assault on system security that derives from an intelligent 
        threat, i.e., an intelligent act that is a deliberate attempt 
        (especially in the sense of a method or technique) to evade security 
        services and violate the security policy of a system. 
         
        Attack can be active or passive, by insider or by outsider, or via 
        attack mediator. 
         
        2.1.2. Attacker 
         
        Attacker is individual who attempts one or more attacks in order to 
        achieve an objective(s). 
         
        For the purpose of FINE attacker is described by its network ID, 
        organisation which network/computer attack was originated and 
        physical location information (optional). 
         
        2.1.3. CSIRT 
         
        CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team) is used in FINE to 
        refer to the authority handling the Incident and creating Incident 
        Report.  The CSIRT is also likely to be involved in evidence 
        collection and custody, incident remedy, etc. 
         
        In FINE CSIRT represented by its ID, constituency, public key, etc. 
         
        2.1.4. Damage 
         
        An intended or unintended consequence of an attack which affects the 
        normal operation of the targeted system or service.  Description of 
        damage may include free text description of actual result of attack, 
        and, where possible, structured information about the particular 
        damaged system, subsystem or service. 
         
        2.1.5. Event 
         
        An action directed at a target which is intended to result in a 
        change of state (status) of the target.  From the point of view of 
        event origination, it can be defined as any observable occurrence in 
        a system or network which resulted in an alert being generated.  For 
        example, three failed logins in 10 seconds might indicate a brute- 
        force login attack.

        2.1.6. Evidence 
         
        Evidence is information relating to an event that proves or supports 
        a conclusion about the event. With respect to security incidents (the 
        events), it may include but is not limited to: data dump created by 
        Intrusion Detection System (IDS), data from syslog file, kernel 
        statistics, cache, memory, temporary file system, or other data that 
        caused the alert or were collected after the incident happened. 
         
        Special rules and care must be taken when storing and archiving 
        evidence, particularly to preserve its integrity. When necessary 
        evidence should be stored encrypted. 
         
        According to the Guidelines for Evidence Collection and Archiving [6] 
        evidence must be strictly secured.  The chain of evidence custody 
        needs to be clearly documented. 
         
        It is essential that evidence should be collected, archived and 
        preserved according to local legislation. 
         
         
        2.1.7. Impact 
         
        Impact describes result of attack expressed in terms of user 
        community, for example the cost in terms of financial or other 
        disruption 
         
        2.1.8. Incident 
         
        An Incident is a security event that involves a security violation. 
        An incident can be defined as a single attack or a group of attacks 
        that can be distinguished from other attacks by the method of attack, 
        identity of attackers, victims, sites, objectives or timing, etc. 
         
        In the context of FINE, the term Incident is used to mean a Computer 
        Security Incident or an IT Security Incident. 
         
        However we should distinguish between the generic definition of 
        'Incident' which is an event that might lead to damage or damage 
        which is not too serious, and 'Security Incident' or 'IT Security 
        Incident' which are defined below: 
         
        a) Security incident is an event that involves a security violation. 
        This may be an event that violates a security policy, AUP, laws and 
        jurisdictions, etc. A security incident may also be an incident that 
        has been escalated to a security incident. 
         
        A security incident is worse than an incident as it affects the 
        security of or in the organisation. A security incident may be 
        logical, physical or organisational, for example a computer 
        intrusion, loss of secrecy, information theft, fire or an alarm that 
        doesn't work properly.  A security incident may be caused on purpose

        or by accident.  The latter may be if somebody forgets to lock a door 
        or forgets to activate an access list in a router. 
         
        b) An IT security incident is defined according to [9] as any real or    
        suspected adverse event in relation to the security of a computer or 
        computer network.  Typical security incidents within the IT area are: 
        a computer intrusion, a denial-of-service attack, information theft 
        or data manipulation, etc. 
         
        2.1.9. Incident Report 
         
        Document describing in details Incident processed by CSIRT.  
        We distinguish general definition of Incident report that is created 
        and handled by CSIRT and may have internal proprietary format 
        adopted to local Incident handling procedures or defined by used 
        Incident Handling System, and Format for INcident report Exchange 
        (FINE) used for exchange of Incident information between CSIRTs. 
        Definition of the requirements to FINE is a subject of this 
        document. 
         
        2.1.10. Incident Handling System 
         
        Incident Handling System (IHS) is used by CSIRT to handle Incidents. 
        It may include user interface, underlying database and may be 
        integrated with ticketing or customer service system. During Incident 
        investigation CSIRT may use specific tools, e.g. for examining log 
        files, mapping network addresses to Internet names and organisations, 
        etc., which also may be integrated into IHS. 
         
        In current document, it is suggested that IHS can produce a document 
        in FINE.  
         
        2.1.11. Target 
         
        A computer or network logical entity (account, process or data) or 
        physical entity (component, computer, network or internetwork). 
         
        2.1.12. Victim 
         
        Victim is individual or organisation which suffered the attack which 
        is described in incident report. 
         
        For the purpose of FINE victim is described by its network ID, 
        organisation and location information. 
         
        2.1.13. Other terms 
         
        Other terms used: alert, activity, IDS, Security Policy, etc., - are 
        defined in related I-Ds, RFCs and standards [2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. 
         
         
        2.2 The Operational Model 
         
      
     Expires August 2003                                           [Page 5] 
      
     INTERNET DRAFT            FINE Requirements            February, 2003 

        Incident Reports are generated, received and updated. For example, 
        An organization may send an Incident Report to a CSIRT when an 
        attack has been detected. Computer Security Incident Response Teams 
        (CSIRTs) receive Incident Reports via different channels including 
        Incident reports from constituency or customers, or from other 
        CSIRTs. The CSIRTs maintain these reports. They may process the 
        reports to generate statistics, or investigate Incident further. As 
        part of the investigation, or as part of the reporting the CSIRT may 
        forward the Incident Report or parts of it to other CSIRTs. The 
        CSIRTs may also receive results of investigation, or additional 
        information related to currently active Incident from other CSIRTs.  
         
        These operations are shown in fig. 1 
         
        From the operational point of view during the whole life-cycle of an 
        Incident Report: 
        +  the report itself evolves; 
        +  the report is exchanged between CSIRT and can be 
          investigated/processed by few CSIRTs at the same moment; 
        +  the changes in the report may be effected by one or more CSIRTs 
        +  a single CSIRT may not be in a position to vouch for the veracity 
          of all parts of the Incident Report 
        + the Incident Report may exist in several states:  
          - complete/closed - the Incident Report is not being processed and 
          no processing is planned 
          - waiting - the Incident Report is waiting on some event, in 
          particular case, a response from one or more CSIRTs 
         
        Also, due to the nature of the operations: 
        + the various parts of an Incident Report will have information of 
          varying degrees of sensitivity and will need to be handled with 
          the  appropriate level of confidentiality.  
        + the Incident Report may be multilingual i.e. different parts of 
          the Incident Report may use different languages. It is also 
          possible that  multiple versions of parts of the report exist, 
          each version in a different language. The versions may not be 
          consistent. 
         
        It is essential to distinguish between internal Incident Report 
        processing procedures and respectfully requirements to internal 
        Incident Report format and Incident Report participating in 
        information exchange between CSIRTs for different purposes, whether 
        itÆs aimed for cooperative investigation, specific information or 
        action request, or just for information or statistics, and therefore 
        complying to FINE.

        Fig. 1 Operational Model of an Incident Handling Procedure 
         
        Initial Incident Report may be based on information or request 
        received from the constituency/victim, Network Operation Center, 
        other CSIRTs or in a form of Alert from automated Intrusion 
        Detection System. It should be noted that there is a generic 
        difference between "Alerts" generated by IDS (as defined in 
        Intrusion Description and Exchange Format (IDMEF) [5] and Incident 
        Reports. The IDMEF Alerts are generated by "sensors" and processed 
        by managers (applications). On the other hand the Incident reports 
        will be created by human beings (although with the support of 
        automated IHS) and will also be finally consumed primarily by human 
        beings. 
         
         
     3. The Goal  
      
        The purpose of the Format for INcident Report Exchange (FINE) is to 
        facilitate the exchange of incident information and statistics among

          authenticity of the message source. 
      
     4. General Requirements 
      
        4.1 The definition of the Format for INcident Report Exchange (FINE) 
        shall reference and use previously published RFCs where possible. 
      
     5. Format Requirements 
         
        5.1 FINE shall support full internationalization and localization. 
         
        A significant part of the FINE will comprise of human-readable text. 
        Since some Incidents need involvement of CSIRTs from different 
        countries, cultural and geographic regions, the FINE description 
        must be formatted such that they can be presented to an operator in 
        a local language and adhering to local presentation formats and 
        local naming rules and conventions. Localized presentation of dates, 
        time and names may also be required. 
         
        In case, if used, the format must be able to identify the rules or 
        conventions that is used in the naming. 
         
        In cases where the messages contain text strings and names that need 
        characters other than Latin-1 (or ISO 8859-1), the information 
        preferably should be represented using the ISO/IEC IS 10646-1 
        character set and encoded using the UTF-8 transformation format, and 
        optionally using local character sets and encodings. 
         
        5.2  FINE must support modularity in Incident description to allow 
        aggregation and filtering of data. 
         
        The structure will contain several components and some components 
        may be structures themselves. Each component of a structure will 
        have a well defined semantics. 
         
        5.3 FINE must provide the possibility for recording the evolution of 
        Incident Report during its whole lifetime. In particular, FINE 
        should contain the record of all communications that happened in 
        course of current Incident. 
         
        An Incident Report may evolve with time. As investigation proceeds 
        more 
        information about an incident may be revealed and parts of the 
        earlier information will be refined/obsolete.  The Format for 
        Incident report Exchange should be able to support the record of the 
        evolution of the Incident Report with the level of details defined 
        internal/adopted Incident Handling procedure Appropriate timestamps 
        identifying the epochs in the lifetime of an Incident Report should 
        be also possible/applied. 
         
        5.4 FINE must support the application of an access restriction 
        policy to individual components. 
      
     Expires August 2003                                           [Page 8] 
      
     INTERNET DRAFT            FINE Requirements            February, 2003 

         
        An Incident Report may potentially contain sensitive or private 
        information (such as passwords, persons/organisations identifiers or 
        forensic information (evidence data)) and in some cases may be 
        exposed to non-authorised persons. It must be possible to define the 
        degree of confidentiality for the individual components of the 
        Incident Report and for different roles and parties involved. 
         
        Such situations may arise particularly in case of Incident 
        information exchange between CSIRTs or other involved bodies. 
        Technical realization may include using special restriction 
        attributes or general external technology available with 
        implementation format, which can be applied by Incident Handling 
        System. Some cases may be addressed by encrypting FINE elements, 
        however this will not always be possible. Therefore, to prevent 
        accidental disclosure of sensitive data, parts of the FINE object 
        must be marked with access restriction attributes.  These markings 
        will be particularly useful when used with automated processing 
        systems  
         
        5.5 An FINE report must be globally uniquely identifiable.  
         
        It should be possible to map the origin/creator of an Incident 
        Report from its globally unique identifier. 
         
        5.6. The Format for Incident report Exchange itself must be 
        extensible. The extension will be in terms of addition of components 
        and/or extending the components. 
         
         
     6. Communication Mechanisms Requirements 
         
        6.1. Incident Report exchange will normally be initiated by humans 
        using standard communication protocols and exchange mechanisms, for 
        example, e-mail, HTTP, XML Web Services, FTP, etc. FINE must not 
        rely on communication mechanisms to satisfy requirements of current 
        document. The communication mechanisms must have no bearing on the 
        authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of the Incident Report 
        itself. Communications security requirements may be applied 
        separately according to local policy so are not defined by this 
        document. 
         
         
     7. Content Requirements  
         
        FINE must be flexible enough to support various degrees of 
        completeness. At the same time it must clearly state the minimal 
        information without which the information in the Incident Report 
        will be seriously degraded. 
         
        7.1  An Incident Report will generally refer to one or more 
        entities. The entity may be an attacker, a victim or an observer. 
        There are several facets of an entity involved in an Incident 
      
     Expires August 2003                                           [Page 9] 
      
     INTERNET DRAFT            FINE Requirements            February, 2003 

        Report. The entity may have zero or more network addresses and names 
        as well as zero or more location names, organizational name, person 
        names, machine names etc. FINE should support various facets 
        describing the entities involved. 
         
        7.2  The Incident Report should contain the type of the attack if 
        it's known. 
         
        FINE must support well-known classification/enumeration schemes. It 
        is expected that this type will be drawn from a standardized list of 
        events/attacks; a new type of event may use a temporary 
        implementation- specific type if the event type has not yet been 
        standardized. 
         
        Incident handling may involve many different staff members and 
        teams. It is therefore essential that common terms are used to 
        describe incidents. If the event type has not yet been standardized, 
        temporary type definition might be given by team created Incident 
        Report.  It is expected that new type name will be self-explanatory 
        and derived from a similar, existing type definition. 
         
        7.3. FINE must include the Identity of the creator (or current 
        owner) of the Incident Report (CSIRT or other authority).  This may 
        be the sender in an information exchange or the team currently 
        handling the incident. 
         
        The identity of Incident description creator is often valuable 
        information for Incident response.  In one possible scenario the 
        attack may progress through the network, comparison of corresponding 
        incidents reported by different authorities might provide some 
        additional information about the origin of the attack.  This is also 
        useful information at post-incident information handling/exchange 
        stage. 
         
        7.4  The FINE should contain information about the attacker and 
        victim, if known. 
         
        7.5  The FINE should contain reference to advisories corresponding 
        to the Incident Report, e.g. CERT/CC, CVE, and others. 
         
        7.6  The FINE should contain a detailed description of the attack 
        that caused the current Incident. In particular, FINE should contain 
        information about AttackerÆs and VictimÆs systems participated or 
        targeted in that Attack. 
         
        7.7 The FINE may contain a description of the incident in a natural 
        language. 
         
        7.8  The Incident Report should contain or be able to reference 
        additional detailed information/data related to this specific 
        underlying event(s)/activity, often referred as evidence.

     INTERNET DRAFT            FINE Requirements            February, 2003 

        This information may include IDMEF [5] messages, which have been 
        generated by security devices. 
         
        7.9 The Incident Report should describe the Impact on the target, if 
        known. 
        There should be guidelines to describe the impact on the target 
        to ensure a uniform interpretation of the description. 
         
        The value of this field should be drawn from a standardized list of 
        values if the attack is recognized as known, or expressed in a free 
        language by responsible CSIRT team member. 
         
        7.10 The Incident Report should describe the actions taken since the 
        occurrence of the incidence. 
         
        7.11 Time shall be reported as the local time and time zone offset 
        from UTC.  (Note: See RFC 1902 for guidelines on reporting time.) 
         
        Internal Incident Report may contain local presentation of time 
        related information, however FINE must provide unambiguous time 
        presentation. For event correlation purposes, it is important that 
        the manager be able to normalize the time information reported in 
        the FINE descriptions. In case when normalization of the time 
        information is not possible (like in case of referencing additional 
        data about the Incident that cannot be changed, e.g. timestamped log 
        data), the time offset should be mentioned. 
         
        7.12 Time granularity in FINE time parameters shall not be specified 
        by the FINE. 
         
        The time data may be included into FINE description by existing 
        information systems, retrieved from incident reporting messages or 
        taken from IDS data or other event registration tools.  Each of 
        these cases may have its own different time granularity.  For the 
        purposes of implementation, it should be possible to handle time at 
        different stages according to the local system capabilities.  
         
        7.13 The Incident Report should allow application of (external) 
        mechanisms or assertions to assure its authenticity, integrity and 
        non-repudiation can be verified. 
         
        7.14 The semantics of FINE must be well defined.  The various 
        components of FINE should have a well defined semantics.  
         
         
     8. Security Considerations 
         
        This memo does not describe a protocol by itself. This memo 
        describes the requirements for an Incident Report Exchange Format. 
        The reports themselves are about security incidents. The contents of 
        the Incident Reports will have significant direct and/or indirect 
        impact on the security and privacy of a network and/or individuals.
