Internet-Draft       DNS Extensions to Support IPv4 and IPv6      July 2009


Abstract

There are two kinds of TYPE for host IP address: one is A, the other is AAAA,
which records IPv4 and IPv6 addresses respectively. This document defines a new
TYPE, which is mainly used in queries in order to get both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

Internet-Draft       DNS Extensions to Support IPv4 and IPv6       July 2009


1. Introduction

1.1 Current DNS operation

There are mainly two resource record types for host IP addresses in the DNS. One
is A resource record, the other is AAAA resource record. An A record type is
defined to store a host's IPv4 address, an AAAA or A6 is defined to store a host's
IPv6 address.

1.2 Problem for current IPv6 DNS operation

Due to large-scale applicable for IPv4, it will take a long time to transit from
IPv4 to IPv6. During the transition, IPv4 network and IPv6 network will coexist.
In most cases, the host will not know whether the address of the other side is
IPv4 or IPv6. According to current mechanism, the host will send an AAAA query
first. If there is no IPv6 address, then an A query will be sent out.

The above mechanism has following disadvantages. First, it will take longer time
compared with only A or AAAA query is needed. Second, both A and AAAA query will
waste bandwidth, especially the air interface bandwidth. Third, more process
resources in host and DNS server are needed.

In order to solve the above problems, a new kind of record type is proposed.

2. New resource record definition

A new record type mainly used in queries is defined to get the host IPv4 and IPv6
addresses. It is not intended to create new resource record.

2.1 BOTH record type

The BOTH resource record type is specific to the Internet class.

2.2 BOTH data format

There is no new data format is defined. In fact, it is unnecessary to create new
data format.

2.3 BOTH query

A BOTH query for a specified domain name in the Internet class returns all
associated A and AAAA resource records in the answer section of a response.

2.4 Textual format of BOTH records

There is no new textual format for BOTH records.

3. Modifications to existing query types

All existing query types that perform type A and AAAA processing must be redefined
to perform type A, type AAAA and BOTH processing. These definitions mean that a
name server must add any relevant IPv4 addresses and any relevant IPv6 addresses
available locally to the response when processing BOTH queries.

4. Security Considerations

Any information obtained from the DNS must be regarded as unsafe unless there are
some new security mechanism. The definition of the both query type does not change
the model for use of these techniques.

So, this specification is not believed to cause any new security problems, nor to
solve any existing ones.

5. IANA Considerations

There are no IANA assignments to be performed.
