1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 [2] provides network-based mobility for a regular
   IPv6 mobile node with no mobility management protocol.  It is quite
   straight forward to provide mobility for a mobile node with one
   interface.  There are some issues identified with supporting a host
   with multiple interfaces attaching to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.

   The multiple interfaces on the mobile node could be of the same or
   different access technology types.  If the mobile node has multiple
   interfaces attached to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, and wishes to
   use both interfaces simultaneously, the LMA and the MAGs in the Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 domain must allow this.

   The mobile node may also decide to handoff sessions from one
   interface to another.  The two interfaces involved in the handover
   could be of the same or different access technology types.

   In some cases, the mobile node may be assigned the same prefix across
   two interfaces when both interfaces are attached to the Proxy Mobile
   IPv6 domain.  The mobile node may be a regular IPv6 host which cannot
   handle the same prefix across two different interfaces.  Some mobile
   nodes have multi-homing support in the sense that they can connect to
   the same subnet via two interfaces and still able to send and receive
   packets on both interfaces.

   This document analyzes three different scenarios with respect to a
   mobile node with multiple interfaces attaching to a Proxy Mobile IPv6
   domain.

   o  Assigning a unique prefix per interface of the mobile node.
   o  Assigning the same prefix across interfaces but a unique address
      per interface.
   o  Shared address across interfaces.

   In all three scenarios the mobile node is able to use the multiple
   interfaces simultaneously to send and receive packets.

3.  Multiple Interface Scenarios

   Three different scenarios are considered in this document.  The
   following sections describe and analyze the three scenarios.

3.1.  Unique Prefix per Interface

   In this scenario, each interface on the mobile node is assigned a
   unique prefix.  The LMA maintains multiple binding cache entries, one
   entry per interface on the mobile node.  The binding cache entries
   may contain the Layer 2 interface identifier and the access
   technology type of the corresponding interface on the mobile node.
   The LMA also maintains two separate routes for prefix1 and prefix2.

                                 LMA Binding Cache
                    +----+       -----------------
                    |LMA |       MN:if1 [prefix1] --> MAG1
                    +----+       MN:if2 [prefix2] --> MAG2
                     //\\
          +---------//--\\-------------+
         (         //    \\             ) PMIPv6 domain
         (        //      \\            )
          +------//--------\\----------+
                //          \\
               //            \\
            +----+           +----+
            |MAG1|           |MAG2|
            +----+           +----+
              |                |
              |                |
              | if1        if2 |
              +------[MN]------+


                   Figure 1: Unique Prefix per Interface

   The mobile node is able to use both interfaces simultaneously for
   sending and receiving packets.  Since the LMA maintains separate
   route entries for prefix1 and prefix2, it encapsulates and forwards
   the packets via the appropriate MAG.

   When the mobile node moves and attaches to another MAG in the same
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, session continuity is maintained by
   assigning the same prefix to the interface.  If the mobile node moves
   and attaches to MAG3 with if1, the MAG3 sends a Proxy Binding Update
   message to the LMA with the access technology type and interface
   identifier of if1.  The LMA checks if there is an existing binding
   cache entry for the mobile node for if1.  If there is an existing



Devarapalli, et al.      Expires August 28, 2008                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft             PMIPv6 Multihoming              February 2008


   binding cache entry, the LMA assigns the same prefix previously
   assigned and responds to MAG3.

   If there is no L2 interface identifier that MAG3 could identify for
   if1 and did not include the interface identifier in the Proxy Binding
   Update, then the LMA does not know if this is a handover for if1 or
   if the mobile node is attaching via a new interface to MAG3.  The
   LMA's decision is then based on what the Handoff Indicator field in
   the Handoff Indicator option is set to.  If MAG3 knows that the
   mobile node was attached to another MAG in the same Proxy Mobile IPv6
   domain using if1, then it must indicate to the LMA that it is a
   handover.  This would ensure that the mobile node sees the same
   prefix for if1.  Otherwise the mobile node ends up with a new prefix
   for if1.

   The Proxy Mobile IPv6 specification [2] does not specify any
   mechanism for MAG3 to figure out if the mobile node is performing a
   handover for if1 or if it is attaching to the Proxy Mobile IPv6
   domain for the first time via if1.  One option is for MAG3 to obtain
   this information via context transfer from MAG1.  This solution
   requires a context transfer interface between MAG1 and MAG3.  Another
   option is for MAG3 to be told by the AAA infrastructure as part of
   access authentication that the mobile node was previously attached to
   the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain via if1.  However, this solution may not
   work in case the AAA infrastructure does not store interface related
   information or if the AAA infrastructure is not being used.  One
   solution that may work in most cases is for the mobile node to
   indicate to MAG3 that it already has sessions on top of the prefix
   assigned to if1 and it is performing a handover.  The mobile node
   conveys this information as part of Layer 2 setup.  When MAG3 gets
   this information, it sets the Handoff Indicator field in the Handoff
   Indicator option to indicate a handover for if1.

   Section 4 discusses handovers between interfaces using Proxy Mobile
   IPv6 in more detail.

3.2.  Unique Address per Interface

   In this scenario, the mobile node is assigned the same prefix across
   multiple interfaces, but with a unique address per interface.  The
   LMA maintains separate binding cache entries per address of the
   mobile node.  The LMA may also maintain a single binding cache entry,
   but must have separate host route entries per address assigned to the
   mobile node.  This scenario illustrated in Figure 2 creates a multi-
   homing scenario where the mobile node has connectivity via two
   interfaces to the same subnet.

              +------[MN]------+


                  Figure 2: Unique Address per Interface

   The mobile node is able to use both interfaces simultaneously for
   sending and receiving packets.  Since the LMA maintains separate host
   route entries for addr1 and addr2, it encapsulates and forwards the
   packets via the appropriate MAG.

   This scenario however creates a multi-link subnet since the same
   prefix is advertised over two different point-to-point links.
   Neighbor discovery is not run across the two point-to-point links
   even though the same prefix is used across the links.  Please refer
   to [5] for more information on issues regarding multi-link subnets.

3.3.  Shared Address across Interfaces

   In this scenario, the mobile node is assigned the same address across
   multiple interfaces.  This scenario enables a mobile node to use
   different links, but make only one IP address visible to the
   applications.  The mobile node can send and receive packets for one
   particular application flow over if1 and for another application flow
   over if2.  This scenario also enables a mobile node to combine two
   low bandwidth links into a high bandwidth link.  Figure 3 illustrates
   this scenario.

              +------[MN]------+


                Figure 3: Shared Address across Interfaces

   The LMA maintains only one binding cache entry per mobile node in
   this scenario.  However, the LMA maintains flow filters that indicate
   routing to a particular MAG.  For example, lets assume that the
   mobile node has two separate flows, flow1 and flow2 and wants to run
   flow1 over if1 and flow2 over if2.  When the LMA receives a packet
   for the mobile node, it checks the flow filters stored in the binding
   cache entry.  If the packets match filter1, the LMA tunnels the
   packets to MAG1.

   For this scenario to work, the mobile node must be able to indicate
   to the attached MAG which flow will be sent over the attachment to
   the MAG.  It may do this by indicating the service identifer during
   the layer 2 attachment to the MAG.  The service identifier is
   described in [4].  The MAG, in turn must include the flow information
   in the Proxy Binding Update sent to the LMA.  The MAG may use the
   Service Selection option [4] in the Proxy Binding Update to indicate
   the flow information.  The MAG may also contruct a flow filter and
   convey the information in the Proxy Binding Update.  See [3] for more
   information on carrying flow filters in the proxy binding update.

   The LMA processes the Proxy Binding Update from the MAG and creates a
   filter based on the flow information.  The flow filters may be stored
   in the binding cache entry for the mobile node.

4.  Handovers across Interfaces

   Using Proxy Mobile IPv6 for handovers across interfaces requires the
   following at the minimum on the mobile node.

   o  Removal of the IP address/prefix from the old interface.
   o  Configuration of the same IP address/prefix on the new interface.
   o  Update of active socket structures to the new interface.

   The following describes the requirements for a handover across
   interface in more detail.

4.1.  Requirements for a PMIPv6 Handover across Interfaces

4.1.1.  Removal of IP Address/Prefix from Old Interface

   An IP address can be removed from the old interface through a tear-
   down of the link-layer connection, provided the IP address was auto-
   configured.  Standard host stack implementations remove auto-
   configured IP addresses from interfaces that have lost link-layer
   connectivity.  The advantage of this mechanism is that it is network-
   controlled and does not require special host functionality.  A
   disadvantage of the mechanism is its coarse granularity: A link-layer
   connectivity tear-down leads to the removal of all IP addresses on an
   interface.  So if an interface has multiple IP addresses, all of them
   are removed, yet a handover may be desired for only one of them.

   Link-layer connectivity tear-down is the only means by which a
   network can control the removal of an IP address from an old
   interface.  Standard host stack implementations generally do not
   accept IP layer control messages as a trigger for IP address removal.
   For example, zero-lifetime advertisements for an IP address prefix in
   Router Advertisement messages [6] are ignored in an effort to protect
   against denial-of-service attacks.

   Alternative mechanisms to remove an IP address from the old interface
   therefore require new functionality on mobile nodes.  The handover
   may be indicated by the network, such as through a zero-lifetime
   advertisement for an IP address prefix in Router Advertisement
   messages.  But it is the mobile node which must correctly interpret
   such indication and remove the corresponding IP address.

4.1.2.  Configuration of Same IP Address/Prefix on New Interface

   A successful handover across interfaces requires a mobile node to
   configure the new interface with the same IP address that was
   previously used on the old interface.  The standard mechanism for
   autonomous address auto-configuration in IPv6, Stateless Address



Devarapalli, et al.      Expires August 28, 2008                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft             PMIPv6 Multihoming              February 2008


   Autoconfiguration [7], does not support this.  It derives IP
   addresses from the respective interface identifiers, and thus
   generates different IP addresses on different interfaces.

   Configuration of the same IP address on a new interface therefore
   requires either network-controlled IP address configuration through
   DHCPv6, L2 address assignment mechanisms or new functionality on the
   mobile nodes.

4.1.3.  Update of Active Socket Structures

   Typically, sockets structures are opened based on the address
   assigned to an interface.  As long as the address is available on one
   of the interfaces on the mobile node, the active sockets should not
   get affected.  However, many implementations today include a pointer
   to the interface in socket structures.  This makes handovers between
   different interfaces impossible.  Handovers across interfaces may
   therefore require modifications to such implementations to make
   socket structures interface-independent.

4.2.  Inter-Access Technology Handovers

   This section considers a handover scenario where the mobile node
   performs a handover between interfaces that belong to different
   access technologies.

   The mobile node is initially attached to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain
   via MAG1 using if1 as show in Figure 4.

                  Figure 4: Mobile Node attached via if1

   The mobile node moves and attaches to the same Proxy Mobile IPv6
   domain via MAG2 using if2.  The mobile node may not have connectivity
   on if1 anymore.  The LMA assigns the same prefix for if2 and updates
   its binding cache entry.  This is illustrated in Figure 5.

              Figure 5: Mobile Node Performs Handover to if2

   For the above inter-access technology handover to work, the LMA must
   know that this is a handover involving two different interfaces of
   the mobile node.  The Interface Identifier option if present in the
   Proxy Binding Update from MAG2 will have a different identifier from
   what is stored in the binding cache entry on the LMA.  So this might
   appear to the LMA as if the mobile node is attaching via a different
   interface.  The Proxy Binding Update from MAG2 MUST have the Handoff
   Indicator field in the Handoff Indicator option set to "2" or "3" to
   indicate that it is a handover.  See Section 3.1 for a detailed
   description of how MAG2 determines when to indicate in the Proxy
   Binding Update that it is a handover.

   The mobile node must also be able to move the prefix from if1 to if2
   during the handover for the inter-access technology handover to work.
   The mobile node should satisfy the requirements listed in Section 4.1
   for the handover to work.

4.3.  Mobile node with three or more interfaces

   This section considers a handover scenario for a mobile node with
   three or more interfaces and performing a handover from if1 to if3
   while staying connected over if2.  It is assumed that the mobile node
   is attached to MAG1 using if1, MAG2 using if2 and MAG3 using if3.  In
   this scenario, even if MAG3 knows that it is a handover, it does not
   which two interfaces are involved in the handover.  The AAA
   infrastructure does not help here since the AAA does not know which
   interface is being handed off to which one.  The only possible
   solution here is for the mobile node to tell MAG3 more information
   about if1 or the home network prefix assigned to if1 or information
   about MAG1.  MAG3 may indicate in the Proxy Binding Update
   information about if1 or the prefix assigned to if1 in the Proxy
   Binding Update sent to the LMA.  The LMA uses this information to
   assign the prefix that was assigned to if1 to if3 also.  In case the
   mobile node provides information about MAG1, then MAG3 can contact
   MAG1 over a context transfer interface and obtain more information
   about if1 or the home network prefix assigned to if1.  In all cases,
   MAG3 indicates that it is a handover in the Proxy Binding Update.

   Yet another handover scenario is where the mobile is attached to MAG1
   via if1 and MAG2 via if2, decides to attach to MAG2 via if3 and
   perform a handover from the if1 to if3.  In this scenario, the mobile
   node must indicate to MAG2 that it is performing a handover from if1
   by providing information about if1 when attaching to MAG2 using if3.
   MAG2 would then treat the attachment over if3 as a handover from if1
   and will indicate this in this Proxy Binding Update to the LMA.  The
   LMA would then assign the same prefix that was previously assigned
   for if1.  MAG would further treat existing attachment over if2
   separately and cause no modifications to the sessions over if2.


5.  Security Considerations

   This document mainly analyzes some of the scenarios arising out of a
   mobile node with multiple interfaces attaching to a Proxy Mobile IPv6
   domain.  It does not introduce any new security concerns on top of
   what is described in the Security Considerations section of [2].


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not request any assignments from IANA.

7.  Acknowledgements

   Many of the issues related to using Proxy Mobile IPv6 with a mobile
   node with multiple interfaces were discussed on the NETLMM mailing
   list.  This document tries to capture those issues.  Therefore the
   authors would like to thank all the folks invovled in those
   discussions.

   The authors would also like to think Sri Gundavelli, Kuntal
   Chowdhury, Basavaraj Patil, Vidya Narayanan, and George Tsirtsis for
   some interesting discussions in this space.
