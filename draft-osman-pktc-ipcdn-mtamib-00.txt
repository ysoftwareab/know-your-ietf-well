     Abstract 
      
        This memo is a draft document of the initial version of the document.  
        This document does not have any predecessors. 
       
       This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with     
       network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular, it defines a 
       basic set of managed objects for SNMP- based management of PacketCable 1.0 
       compliant Media Terminal Adapter (MTA) devices. 
      
        This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the 
        SNMP SMIv2 [5][6][7].  The set of objects are consistent with the 
        SNMP framework and existing SNMP standards.

     1.  The SNMP Management Framework 
      
        The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major 
        components: 
      
        o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1]. 
      
        o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the 
            purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of 
            Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 
            16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The 
            second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 
            [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].

     Internet Draft               PacketCable MTA MIB                June 24, 2002 
      
        o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The 
            first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and 
            described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message 
            protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is 
            called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10]. 
            The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and 
            described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574 [12]. 
      
        o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The 
            first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is 
            described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol 
            operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 
            [13]. 
      
        o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and 
            the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 
            [15]. 
      
        A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework 
        can be found in RFC 2570 [16]. 
      
        Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
        the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are 
        defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI. 
      
        This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A 
        MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate 
        translations. The resulting translated MIB MUST be semantically 
        equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no 
        translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable 
        information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in 
        SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine 
        readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the 
        MIB.

     3.  Overview 
      
        This MIB provides a set of objects required for the management of PacketCable 
        compliant media Terminal Adapters (MTA). The specification is derived in part  
        from the parameters described in PacketCable 1.0 Provisioning Specification [17]. 
         
     3.1.  Structure of the MIB 

        This MIB is structured as three groups: 
      
        o    Management information pertinent to MTA Device Itself (pktcMtaDevBase). 
      
        o    Management information pertinent to the Provisioning back office Servers 
             (pktcMtaDevServer). 
      
        o    Management information pertinent to elements of and logic providing the   
             PacketCable Security mechanisms (pktcMtaDevSecurity). 
      
        First two groups contain only scalar information describing the corresponding 
        characteristics of the MTA device and back office servers. 
      
        Third group contains two tables controlling the necessary logical associations 
        between KDC realms and back office servers (CMS and Provisioning). 
      
        Rows in the tables can be created automatically (e.g. by the device according  
        to the current state information) or can be created by the management station 
        depending on the operational situation. Tables may and generally will have a  
        mixture of both types of rows. 
      
     3.1.1. pktcMtaDevBase 
      
        Contains management information describing the parameters of the MTA device  
        itself. Also, this group contains some objects controlling the MTA state. Some  
        of the MIB objects are as follows: 
      
        pktcMtaDevSerialNumber -                          - Contains the MTA Serial Number. 
      
        pktcMtaDevMacAddress - Contains the MTA MAC address. 
      
        pktcMtaDevEndPntCount -                         - Contains the number of End Points present in MTA.

        pktcMtaDevProvisioningState -                              - This object contains the information describing 
        the completion state of the initialization process. 
      
        pktcMtaDevEnabled -                      - Controls the state of the MTA enabling or disabling  
        telephony services on the device. 
      
        pktcMtaDevResetNow - This object is used to instruct the MTA to reset itself. 
      
      
     3.1.2.  pktcMtaDevServer 
      
        Contains management information describing the back office servers and the  
        parameters assigned to the communication timeouts. Also, this group contains  
        some objects controlling the initial MTA interaction with the Provisioning Server.  
        Some of the MIB objects are as follows: 
      
        pktcMtaDevServerDhcp1 -                         - This object contains the IP Address of the Primary  
        DHCP server designated for MTA provisioning. 
      
        pktcMtaDevServerDhcp2 -                         - This object contains the IP Address of the Secondary  
        DHCP server designated for MTA provisioning. 
      
        pktcMtaDevServerDns1 -                         - This object contains the IP Address of the Primary 
        DNS used by MTA to resolve the FQDN and IP Addresses. 
      
        pktcMtaDevServerDns2 -                         - This object contains the IP Address of the Secondary 
        DNS used by MTA to resolve the FQDN and IP Addresses. 
      
        pktcMtaDevConfigFile -                         - This object contains the name of the provisioning  
        configuration file to download from the Provisioning Server by the MTA. 
      
        pktcMtaDevProvConfigHash -                            - This object is used to supply the hash value  
        of MTA Configuration File calculated over its content. 
      
     3.1.3.  pktcMtaDevSecurity 
      
        Contains management information describing the security related characteristics 
        of the MTA. 
         
        Also, this group contains two tables containing logical dependencies and  
        parameters necessary to establish security association between the MTA and  
        other components of the back office. 
      
        pktcMtaDevRealmTable - This table is used in conjunction with any server  
        which needs a Security Association with an MTA (CMS or Provisioning Sever). 
         
        pktcMtaDevCmsTable - This table contains the parameters describing the SA 
        establishment between an MTA and a CMS.

     Internet Draft               PacketCable MTA MIB                June 24, 2002 
      
        This section clarifies the relationship between various MIB Objects in  
        MTA MIB in respect to the role these objects are playing in the process 
        of the Security Association establishment.  
      
      
     3.2.1.  Security Association Establishment Process 
         
        Relationships between the MTA MIB Objects are defined by the way how the  
        Security Association establishment process is defined by the PacketCable 
        Security Specification [18]. 
         
        The SA establishment process between the MTA and other back office Servers 
        (CMS or Provisioning Server) consists of two steps: 
      
        o   AS-exchange providing mutual authentication of the parties (MTA and the  
            Server), 
      
        o   AP-exchange providing the Key Distribution between the parties (MTA  
            and the Server). 
      
        Each Server-MTA Security Association has a one-to-one correspondence to a  
        single Realm.  
      
     3.2.2.  Realm Table to CMS Table Relationship 
      
        Realm Table contains the parameters defining the process of the AS-exchange 
        between the MTA and the KDC when MTA is going to be authenticated to either  
        of the Severs -                   - CMS or Provisioning. Realm Table is indexed by the Realm Name. 
      
        CMS Table contains the parameters defining the process of the AP-exchange 
        between the MTA and the CMS when MTA is exchanging the keys for SA with CMS.  
        CMS Table is indexed by the CMS FQDN.  
      
        CMS Table also contains the Realm Name corresponding to each CMS FQDN  
        (each row). This allows for multiple realms, each with its own Security  
        Association. 
         
     3.2.3.  SA Related Scalar MIB Objects in MTA MIB 
      
        MTA MIB also contains the group of the scalar MIB Objects which define the  
        Parameters for AP-exchange process between the MTA and the Provisioning  
        Server. These objects are: 
      
        o   pktcMtaDevProvUnsolicitedKeyMaxTimeout 
        o   pktcMtaDevProvUnsolicitedKeyNomTimeout 
        o   pktcMtaDevProvUnsolicitedKeyMaxRetries 
        o   pktcMtaDevProvSolicitedKeyTimeout

     -- 
     --        If the entry does not exist in the CMS MAP table, the

     --        perform key management to establish required security  
     --        associations. Once the desired CMS entry is established,  
     --        the current CMS MAP table entry is marked inactive and  
     --        the newly created CMS MAP table entry is marked active.  
     --        Otherwise the current CMS MAP table entry remains  
     --        active and the newly created CMS MAP table entry is marked  
     --        in active. 
     -- 
     --        If the entry does not exist in the CMS MAP table and the  
     --        CMS entry does not exist in the CMS table, a new CMS table  
     --        entry should be created.  This CMS entry should use the  
     --        same realm as used by this endpoint. The default values  
     --        for the clock skew and AP request/AP reply adaptive 
     --        backoff parameters should be used.  The MTA will now

     --        it performs key management based on the corresponding entry  
     --        in the CMS table.  If the matching CMS entry does not exist,  
     --        it must ignore the wake-up or rekey messages.

     8.  Security Considerations 
      
         This MIB relates to a system which will provide metropolitan public 
         internet access.  As such, improper manipulation of the objects 
         represented by this MIB may result in denial of service to a large 
         number of end-users.  In addition, manipulation of the Realm Table, 
         CMS Table, and several other vital MIB objects such as (not limited to) 
         PktcMtaDevConfigFile, pktcMtaDevProvConfigHash, pktcMtaDevProvConfigKey, 
         may lead to the theft of service or significant disruption of the  
         functionality of the MTA.

     Internet Draft               PacketCable MTA MIB                June 24, 2002 
      
      
         There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that 
         have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such 
         objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
         environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
         environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
         network operations. 
      
         SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network 
         itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no 
         control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and 
         GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB. 
      
         PacketCable 1.0 complaint MTA devices are required to implement secure  
         SNMPv3 access to MTA MIB. It is highly recommended that the other  
         Potential implementers will consider the security features as provided  
         by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of the User-based Security  
         Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View- based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15]  
         is recommended. 
      
         It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP 
         entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly 
         configured to give access to the objects only to those principals 
         (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET 
         (change/create/delete) them.

        IETF's procedures with respect to rights in standards-track and 
        standards-related documentation can be found in BCP-11.  Copies of 
        claims of rights made available for publication and any assurances of 
        licenses to be made available, or the result of an attempt made to 
        obtain a general license or permission for the use of such 
        proprietary rights by implementers or users of this specification can 
        be obtained from the IETF Secretariat. 
      
        The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any 
        copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary 
        rights that may cover technology that may be required to practice
