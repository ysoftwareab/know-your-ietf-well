Nmax = link capacity, i.e., the maximum number of simultaneously 
        established LSPs for all classes together, 
Nc = the number of simultaneously established class c LSPs, for c = 
        1, 2, and 3, respectively. 
    
Bc = maximum number of simultaneously established class c LSPs. 
    
B1 = maximum number of simultaneously established class 1 LSPs, 
B2 = maximum number of simultaneously established LSPs for classes 1 
        and 2 together, 
B3 = maximum number of simultaneously established LSPs for classes 
        1, 2, and 3 together. 
    
PB1 = blocking probability of class 1 
PB2 = blocking probability of class 2 
PB3 = blocking probability of class 3 
    
PP2 = preemption probability of class 2 
PP3 = preemption probability of class 3
