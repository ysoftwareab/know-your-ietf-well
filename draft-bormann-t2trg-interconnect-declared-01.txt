Abstract

   "Limited Domains" are parts of an internet that may have notable
   differences or are just convenient to separate from the general
   Internet and can be delimited from that and from other Limited
   Domains by a defined boundary (the "border").

   This memo focuses on the case where the nodes inside the Limited
   Domain want to interact with nodes on (or reachable via) the general
   Internet, but need some assistance at the border that is cognizant
   about the specific properties of the nodes in the Limited Domain.

   Self-Descriptions can provide the information needed for this
   assistance.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC8799] introduces the concept of "Limited Domains", i.e., parts of
   an internet that may have notable differences or are just convenient
   to separate from the general Internet and can be delimited from that
   and from other Limited Domains by a defined boundary (the "border").

   Limited Domains are not a new concept, but they recently have gained
   significant attention as a way to accelerate innovation without
   always having to wait for the whole Internet to accept a new feature
   [USEFUL].

   Some Limited Domains can be directly connected to or interconnected
   via the Internet -- rules they use internally simply lose their force
   outside the Limited Domain.  Some require stripping off some
   structures or translating some fields on the border to the Internet.
   Some can only be interconnected by running tunnels on top of the
   Internet.

   This memo focuses on the case where the nodes inside the Limited
   Domain want to interact with nodes on (or reachable via) the general
   Internet, but need some assistance at the border that is cognizant
   about the specific properties of the nodes in the Limited Domain.

   6LoWPAN header compression [RFC6282] actually is such an example,
   which can be considered a very small Limited Domain -- initially just
   the link and adaptation layer between two LoWPAN nodes, which
   themselves otherwise feel like standard Internet nodes. (6LoWPAN
   neighbor discovery [RFC6775] already extends the Limited Domain out
   to the border router (6LBR), but let's focus on header compression
   itself for now.)  Extending the Limited Domain to more than two nodes
   may allow the nodes inside the Limited Domain to make use of the
   knowledge that all of them share some common procedures, such as
   using the [RFC8138] routing header (6LoRH); it is then the job of the
   border router (6LBR) to decapsulate this form into packets that can
   be used in the global Internet and to appropriately encapsulate
   global Internet packets on the way in.  (Virtual Reassembly Buffers
   (VRBs, [RFC8930]) simulate a subnet-size Limited Domain based on
   [RFC6282]'s hop-by-hop ones.)

   This memo uses examples from the area of the Internet of Things
   (IoT), both because the author is most familiar with it and because a
   concept of self-descriptions has already been developed for this
   area, which provide new opportunities for organizing Limited Domains
   (Section 3).  (To do: add more examples from outside the IoT core.)

1.1.  Terminology

   Limited Domain:  An area in a network that is separate from others by
      notable internal differences and/or by a strong administrative
      demarcation.  Examples are found in Section 4 of [RFC8799],
      however this document is not limiting itself to those or to the
      definition in [RFC8799].  In contrast to some other usage, the
      nodes in a Limited Domain are expected to normally form a
      connected graph, possibly by employing tunnels between them.
      However, not all nodes in a Limited Domain always need to be aware
      of their situation or implement all the internal differences.

      etc.) that are situated on the boundary between a Limited Domain
      and a different one and/or the general Internet.

      interoperation with other Limited Domains (LD3) or with specially
      equipped Internet nodes (Limited Domains of size 1, Y logically
      containing a B).

2.  Desirable Communication

   All the examples so far presume an environment where it is desirable
   that any node can communicate with any other node.  This has
   certainly served well as a guiding principle for quickly improving
   the value of a network: Leaving open the potential to communicate
   maximizes the potential network effect [METCALFE].  However,
   firewalls are then widely used to suppress some of these potential
   communication paths [FIREWALL].  MUD [RFC8520] was designed to aid
   routers and switches in setting up limited connectivity to this end.

   In the MUD architecture, we first build a system that fundamentally
   supports unlimited connectivity from everyone to everyone and then
   restrict it based on self-descriptions of the nodes.  An alternative
   approach would be an architecture that does not provide any
   connectivity unless and until that is authorized by declared
   communication requirements that have in turn been authorized by some
   management entity.

2.1.  Example: Addressing Desirable Peers Only

   There may be other reasons for pursuing an architecture that limits
   itself to desirable communication only.  A trivial, but maybe not
   overly useful example would be to number all the addresses of
   correspondent hosts allowed by the self-descriptions and replace the
   IP addresses in the packets by these numbers.

   If this limitation becomes part of the architecture, protocols used
   inside the Limited Domains could completely get rid of IP addresses
   and use just the correspondent numbers (possibly packaged in
   something that looks like an IP address, but is limited in its
   variability to just encapsulating that number).

   The border router would become a NAT, but one that is acting based on
   extensive, precomputable information about the communication
   requirements inside the Limited Domain, instead of learning and
   potentially losing dynamic state that becomes a single point of
   failure.

   Again, this is a trivial example, but it should be sufficient as a
   motivation for having a look at employing knowledge about the nodes
   and their communication requirements in a Limited Domain for
   interconnecting this with the Internet (and thus possibly to like-
   minded (Limited Domains on the other side of an Internet path).

3.  Self-Descriptions

   Note that not all of the information that may be needed as a
   description of Limited Domain nodes can come from MUD-like class
   definitions.  Limited Domain nodes are instantiations of these
   classes, where the instantiations will differ between each other in
   details.  Different Limited Domain nodes may also be assigned a
   different purpose in life, causing a need to further parameterize the
   self-description.

   Alongside a discussion of an interconnection architecture that can
   make use of self-descriptions would therefore need to be a discussion
   on how to structure self-description classes with this purpose in
   mind and how to parameterize these and derive description instances.

   For the Internet of Things (IoT), additional self-description
   techniques have been defined that can provide information for Limited
   Domain network elements.  A fully instance-oriented description of an
   IoT device is provided by a W3C WoT (Web of Things) Thing Description
   [TD].  W3C WoT is presently in the process of adding a class-based
   description technique to TDs, the Thing Model (previously called
   Thing Description Template, TDT) [TD-WD].  The communication patterns
   offered by the device are detailed in _Protocol Bindings_, which can
   contain URIs combined with protocol-specific vocabulary ([TD-PB],
   currently defined for HTTP, CoAP, MQTT).  An experimental extension
   to TDs that enables deriving the configuration of Time-Sensitive
   Networking (TSN) networks from the self-description is described in
   [TD-OPC-UA].

   An IoT-oriented description technique that, unlike TD, is class-based
   from the outset is the Semantic Definition Format (SDF) for Data and
   Interactions of Things [I-D.ietf-asdf-sdf].  A concept similar to WoT
   Protocol Bindings is not defined yet, but a combination of MUD and
   SDF descriptions could provide a basic description of a device
   situated in a Limited Domain.

   The Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) architecture also
   provides instance-oriented self-descriptions in the form of the CoRE
   Link Format [RFC6690], an instance of which is provided by each CoAP
   server under /.well-known/core.  Link-format information, as well as
   self-describing information in the newer CoRAL format
   [I-D.ietf-core-coral], can be stored in the CoRE Resource Directory
   [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory].

   All these potential sources of (self-)description only provide meager
   information about purpose-in-life, i.e., beyond the intrinsic
   properties of the device.  Obtaining a full description of the
   communication requirements of a node (including its desirable
   correspondence nodes) will therefore require additional input, beyond
   the class-based self-descriptions of the devices.

4.  Directions of Work

   The above discussion leads us to the following interrelated areas for
   further exploration:

   1.  Extending the self-description mechanisms to provide more
       information that may be useful in a Limited Domain.

   2.  Merging the self-description information with other
       configuration/management information (such as purpose-in-life)
       that may be available for the Limited Domain.

   3.  Defining Limited Domain architectures that can benefit from
       information made available by (1) and (2), including defining the
       operation of network elements and nodes inside the Limited
       Domain.

   4.  Defining border network element functionality that makes such a
       Limited Domain a Globally Interoperable Limited Domain.

   5.  Defining border network element functionality that makes such a
       Limited Domain an Externally Interoperable Limited Domain.

   6.  Discovery between Limited Domains, between Limited Domain nodes
       (Rendezvous problem); establishment of communications (cf.
       [RFC8445]).

   7.  Defining appropriate security workflows and the supporting
       security mechanisms for items 1 to 6.

   8.  Addressing operational considerations for items 1 to 7.

   9.  Addressing privacy considerations for items 1 to 8.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document contains no requests to IANA.

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC8799] apply.

   Item 7 of Section 4 raises the need for security work, one example of
   which might be:

   Self-descriptions of nodes in many cases need to undergo an
   authorization process before they can be used as the basis of network
   configuration.  The authorization process sketched by [RFC8520] may
   be too simplistic, in particular the simplified number of
   stakeholders assumed.  The present document is not providing answers
   in this space, but needs to raise the issue.
