  Abstract  
      
     This document defines the "doi" Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) 
     scheme for the Digital Object Identifier (DOI). DOIs are 
     identifiers for entities of significance to the content 
     industries. The "doi" URI scheme allows a resource associated with 
     an entity identified by a DOI to be referenced by a URI for 
     Internet applications.  A "doi" URI is dereferenced to a set of 
     service descriptions through discoverable resolution mechanisms.

  1  Introduction  
          
     This document defines the "doi" Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) 
     scheme for the Digital Object Identifier (DOI). DOIs are 
     identifiers for entities of significance to the content 
     industries. The "doi" URI scheme allows a resource associated with 
     an entity identified by a DOI to be referenced by a URI for 
     Internet applications.  A "doi" URI is dereferenced to a set of 
     service descriptions through discoverable resolution mechanisms. 
      
     The term "Digital Object Identifier" should be construed as 
     meaning an identifier ("Identifier") of an entity ("Object") for 
     use in networked environments ("Digital"). In this sense an 
     "Object" can be any entity - any digital or physical manifestation 
     or  performance, or any abstract work or concept - that is 
     identified by a DOI.  
      
     Some concepts relevant to DOI follow: 
      
     International DOI Foundation (IDF) û The International DOI 
        Foundation, Inc. is a non-stock membership corporation 
        organized in 1997 and existing under and by virtue of the 
        General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, USA. The 
        Foundation is controlled by a Board elected by the members of 
        the Foundation. The Corporation is a "not-for-profit" 
        organization, i.e. prohibited from activities not permitted to 
        be carried on by a corporation exempt from US federal income 
        tax under Section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code of 
        1986 et seq. 
      
        The activities of the Foundation are controlled by its members, 
        operating under a legal Charter and formal By-laws. Membership 
        is open to all organizations with an interest in electronic 
        publishing, content distribution, rights management, and 
        related enabling technologies. 
         
        The Foundation was founded to develop a framework of 
        infrastructure, policies and procedures to support the 
        identification needs of the content industries.

  2  Terminology 
      
     In this document the key words "must", "must not", "required", 
     "shall", "shall not", "should", "should not", "recommended", 
     "may", and "optional" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 
     2119 [1] and indicate requirement levels for compliant 
     implementations. 
   
  3  The "doi" URI Scheme 
          
  3.1 Definition of "doi" URI Syntax  
          
     The "doi" URI syntax defined in this document conforms to the 
     generic URI syntax. This specification uses the Augmented Backus-
     Naur Form (ABNF) notation of RFC 2234 [2] to define the URI. The 
     following core ABNF productions are used by this specification as 
     defined by Section 6.1 of RFC 2234: ALPHA, DIGIT, HEXDIG. The 
     complete "doi" URI syntax is as follows: 
      
       doi-uri        = scheme ":" encoded-doi [ "?" query ]  
                                               [ "#" fragment ] 
      
       scheme         = "doi"  
      
       encoded-doi    = prefix "/" suffix  
      
       prefix         = segment 
      
       suffix         = segment *( "/" segment )

       segment        = *pchar 
      
       query          = *( pchar / "/" / "?" ) 
      
       fragment       = *( pchar / "/" / "?" ) 
      
       pchar          = unreserved / escaped / ";" / 
                        ":" / "@" / "&" / "=" / "+" / "$" / "," 
      
       unreserved     = ALPHA / DIGIT / mark 
      
       escaped        = "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG 
      
       mark           = "-" / "_" / "." / "!" / "~" / "*" / "'" / 
                        "(" / ")" 
   
     A "doi" URI has an (encoded) DOI as its scheme-specific part 
     followed by an optional query component followed by an optional 
     fragment identifier. A DOI is constructed by appending a unique 
     suffix string to an assigned prefix string separated by a slash 
     "/" character. The prefix is always assigned to a DOI Prefix 
     Holder by a DOI Registration Agency. The DOI Prefix Holder is 
     responsible for the creation of a valid suffix. The prefix in a 
     DOI corresponds to the naming authority. The administration of any 
     particular DOI may be transferred to another party at any time. 
     The prefix does not denote the owner of a DOI. 
      
     ANSI/NISO Z39.84-2000 [3] is the authoritative reference that 
     specifies the rules for constructing a DOI. Once constructed, a 
     DOI may be regarded as an opaque identifier with no internal 
     structure. The minimum constraints for validation of a DOI string 
     are that the prefix and suffix components be non-empty. 
      
  3.2 Allowed Characters Under the "doi" URI Scheme 
      
     The syntax for a DOI is defined in accordance with the ANSI/NISO 
     Z39.84-2000 standard "Syntax for the Digital Object Identifier 
     Syntax". A DOI is represented using the Unicode [4] character set 
     and is encoded in UTF-8 [5]. 
      
     The "doi" URI syntax uses the same set of allowed US-ASCII 
     characters as specified in RFC 2396 [6] for a generic URI. 
     Reserved characters as well as excluded US-ASCII characters and 
     non-US-ASCII characters must be escaped before forming the URI. 
     Details of the escape encoding can be found in RFC 2396, section 
     2.4.

  3.3 Examples of "doi" URIs 
          
     Some examples of syntactically valid "doi" URIs are given below: 
        
       (a) doi:alpha-beta/182.342-24 
        
     where "alpha-beta" is the prefix and "182.342-24" is the suffix. 
        
       (b) doi:10.abc/ab-cd-ef 
        
     where "10.abc" is the prefix and "ab-cd-ef" is the suffix.  
        
       (c) <rdf:Description about="doi:10.23/2002/january/21/4690"/> 
        
     where "10.23" is the prefix and "2002/january/21/4690" is the 
     suffix. 
      
       (d) doi:11.a.7/0363-0277(19950315)120%3A5%3C%3E1.0.TX%3B2-V 
        
     where "11.a.7" is the prefix and "0363-
     0277(19950315)120%3A5%3C%3E1.0.TX%3B2-V" is the prefix. Note that 
     in unescaped form this DOI is represented in UTF-8 as 
     "11.a.7/0363-0277(19950315)120:5<>1.0.TX;2-V". 
      
       (e) doi:dk/P%C3%A6dagogi%2037(2),%20562 
        
     where "dk" is the prefix and "P%C3%A6dagogi%2037(2),%20562" is the 
     suffix. Note that in unescaped form this DOI is represented in 
     UTF-8 as "dk/P¾dagogi 37(2), 562" and in ISO-Latin-1 as 
     "dk/P†dagogi 37(2), 562". 
   
  4  Normalization and Comparison of "doi" URIs 
      
     In order to facilitate comparison of "doi" URIs and to reduce the 
     risk of false negatives, normalization to the canonical form 
     should be applied to minimize the amount of software processing 
     for such comparisons.  
      
     The following normalization steps should be applied: 
      
         1. Normalize the case of the leading "doi:" token to be      
            lowercase 
         2. Unescape all unreserved %-escaped characters 
         3. Normalize the case of the scheme-specific part 
            including any %-escaped characters to be uppercase 
           
     The following forms of a "doi" URI

  5  DOI Administration 
      
     The International DOI Foundation (IDF) is a not-for-profit 
     membership-based organization founded to develop a framework of 
     infrastructure, policies and procedures to support the 
     identification needs of the content industries. 
     The IDF is the maintenance agency for DOI and appoints DOI 
     Registration Agencies. 
      
     DOIs are created by DOI Prefix Holders and must be registered via 
     a DOI Registration Agency. Any network user can become a DOI 
     Prefix Holder by agreement with a DOI Registration Agency. 
      
     DOI Registration Agencies perform the following functions: 
     allocating DOI prefixes, registering DOIs, and providing the 
     necessary infrastructure to allow DOI Prefix Holders to declare 
     and maintain the metadata associated with a particular DOI. DOI 
     Registration Agencies also maintain knowledge of the current owner 
     of each individual DOI to ensure administrative updates. 
      
     The IDF maintains the DOI system (to allow registration and ensure 
     resolution of DOIs) and provides governance to ensure appropriate 
     use. DOI assignment requires a fee to ensure that the system costs 
     are met. This allows the system to be managed and supports 
     persistence as a function of organization rather than technology. 
     The fee is for the registering of DOIs (and may optionally be 
     passed on to registrants, waived or subsidized by a DOI 
     Registration Agency), but not for the resolution of a DOI. 
      
     The DOI system relies on copyright and trademark law to protect 
     the DOI brand and reputation. DOI is not a patented system; the 
     IDF has not developed any patent claims on the DOI system and does 
     not rely on patent law for remedy. 
      
  6  DOI Resolution 
      
     A "doi" URI references a set of service descriptions which is 
     returned on dereference of the URI. Following such a dereference a 
     service description is typically selected and the corresponding

     service activated. This process of service indirection is commonly 
     referred to as "resolution" a DOI. Examples of services that can 
     be accessed by the resolution of a DOI include redirection to 
     another network resource, return of a metadata record describing 
     the entity identified by the DOI, etc. A discussion of such 
     services is beyond the scope of this document. 
      
     Resolution of a DOI can be accomplished using a variety of network 
     protocols. The combination of a network protocol, an access method 
     defined by that protocol and a service endpoint provides the means 
     of access to a resolution mechanism. As the maintenance agency for 
     DOI, the IDF will publish the means of access for known resolution 
     mechanisms of DOI. For the use of other resolution mechanisms 
     prior knowledge of the means of access is required. 
      
     As such a "doi" URI can be classified both as a name and a 
     locator. The locator references a set of service descriptions. 
     Note that this locator must not be confused with the locator used 
     to retrieve the ultimate representation that may be returned as a 
     result of activating a service. The "doi" URI is thus an instance 
     of an application-level URI and requires a methodology for mapping 
     from the "doi" URI to a proxy locator URI in order to realize its 
     locator role. These mapping methodologies provide the resolution 
     mechanisms that enable a "doi" URI to function as a locator of a 
     set of services. 
   
  7  Rationale 
      
  7.1 Why Create a New URI Scheme for DOI? 
      
     Under RFC 2718, "Guidelines for new URL Schemes" [7], it is stated 
     that a URI scheme should have a "demonstrated utility", and in 
     particular should be applied to "things that cannot be referred to 
     in any other way". DOI meets both of these criteria in that it is 
     a well established identifier (see <http://www.doi.org/>) for 
     entities of significance to the content industries, with some 10 
     million examples in current use on the Internet, and is being 
     widely embraced by the content industries. DOI is not bound to any 
     Internet protocol and so requires its own dedicated URI scheme.  
   
     The administration granularity of existing URI schemes typically 
     operates at the authority component level. By contrast DOIs are 
     managed at the individual identifier level. It is for this reason 
     that the DOI prefix is not to be interpreted as an "owner" 
     authority but rather as the "creator" authority. Once created the  
     "doi" URI may be regarded as an opaque identifier with no internal 
     structure.

                           The "doi" URI Scheme                June 2003 
   
   
  7.2 Why Not Use a URN Namespace ID for DOI? 
   
     RFC 2396 states that a "URN differs from a URL in that it's [sic] 
     primary purpose is persistent labeling of a resource with an 
     identifier". A "doi" URI on the other hand has a dual purpose: 
     both to allow a resource associated with an entity identified by a 
     DOI to be referenced by a URI for Internet applications, as well 
     as to enable access to a set of service descriptions. In this 
     regard a "doi" URI scheme should be considered as being similar to 
     the "tel", "fax" and "modem" URI schemes documented in RFC 2806 
     [8]. 
      
     Further the syntactic requirements of the "doi" URI scheme are 
     incompatible with the URN syntax. Specifically the use of optional 
     query component and/or fragment identifier cannot be accommodated 
     by the URN syntax (cf. Sect. 2.3.2, RFC 2141 [9]). 
      
  8  Security Considerations 
          
     The "doi" URI scheme is subject to the same security 
     considerations as the general URI scheme described in RFC 2396. 
      
     Dereference of a "doi" URI to access a set of service descriptions 
     will be subject to the security considerations of the underlying 
     protocol used to access the resource referenced by the "doi" URI.
