1.  Introduction

   The purpose of this document is to request and explain the
   reclassification of the COPS Usage for Policy Provisioning (COPS-PR)
   [RFC3084] and the Structure of Policy Provisioning Information (SPPI)
   [RFC3159] along with the Differentiated Services Quality of Service
   Policy Information Base [RFC3317], the Framework Policy Information
   Base [RFC3318], and the Framework Policy Information Base for Usage
   Feedback [RFC3571] to Historic status.

2.  Reclassification

   The COPS-PR protocol was designed to provision policy information
   from a Policy Decision Point (PDP) to a Policy Enforcement Point
   (PEP).  The SPPI data modeling language supports COPS-PR by providing
   a data modeling language for specifying Policy Information Bases
   (PIBs).

   The COPS-PR / SPPI technology has seen limited deployment.  The
   Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning data models created within the
   IETF [RFC3317], [RFC3318], [RFC3571] did not reach IETF consensus for
   publication on the standards-track and have since then been
   Informational documents.

   An IAB Network Management Workshop held in 2002 [RFC3535] led to the
   creation of the XML-based Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)
   [RFC6241] and an associated data modeling language called YANG
   [RFC6020].  These new protocols are specifically designed to match
   the needs of network operators.  Configuration management related
   efforts in the IETF Operations and Management Area are now centered
   on NETCONF and YANG.

   It is therefore appropriate to reclassify COPS-PR and SPPI to
   Historic status, as described in [RFC2026].  Along with this action,

   the QoS provisioning data models written in the SPPI language and
   published in [RFC3317], [RFC3318], and [RFC3571] are requested to be
   reclassified to Historic status as well.

3.  Security Considerations

   Reclassifying RFC 3084, RFC 3159, RFC 3317, RFC 3318, and RFC 3571
   has no security implications.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA rules for registering PIB modules defined in [RFC3159]
   remain in force.
