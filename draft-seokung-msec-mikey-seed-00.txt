Abstract 

   This document proposes the addition of new values to use the SEED 
   block cipher algorithm for the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol 
   (SRTP) and the Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) in 
   Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY).

1. Introduction 

1.1. SEED 

   SEED [RFC4269] is a Korean National Industrial Association standard 
   [TTASSEED] and is widely used in South Korea for electronic commerce 
   and financial services that are operated on wired and wireless 
   communications. 

   SEED is a 128-bit symmetric key block cipher that has been developed 
   by KISA (Korea Information Security Agency) and a group of experts 
   since 1998. The input/output block size of SEED is 128-bit and the 
   key length is also 128-bit. SEED has a 16-round Feistel structure.  

1.2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

2. Additions to [RFC3830] payload 

   This section specifies the new values to use the SEED cipher 
   algorithm for SRTP and SRTCP [I-D.ietf-avt-seed-srtp]. 

2.1. Modified Table 6.10.1.b from [RFC3830] 

   For the Encryption algorithm, a one byte length is enough. The 
   currently defined possible values are: 

   SRTP encr alg | Value 
   --------------------- 
   NULL          |     0 
   AES-CM        |     1 
   AES-F8        |     2 
   SEED-CTR      |     3 (NEW)  
   SEED-CCM      |     4 (NEW)  
   SEED-GCM      |     5 (NEW) 

   Figure 1: Table 6.10.1.b from [RFC3830] (Revised)

2.2. Modified Table 6.10.1.d from [RFC3830] 

   For the SRTP pseudo-random function, a one byte length is also 
   enough. The currently defined possible values are: 

   SRTP PRF      | Value 
   --------------------- 
   AES-CM        |     1 
   SEED-CTR      |     2 (NEW) 

   Figure 2: Table 6.10.1.d from [RFC3830] (Revised) 

3. Security Considerations 

   No security problem has been found on SEED. SEED is secure against 
   all known attacks including Differential cryptanalysis, linear 
   cryptanalysis, and related key attacks. The best known attack is only 
   an exhaustive search for the key. For further security 
   considerations, the reader is encouraged to read [SEED-EVAL]. 

4. IANA Considerations 

   In order to align Figure 1 with Table 6.10.1.b in [RFC3830] and 
   Figure 2 with Table 6.10.1.d in [RFC3830], IANA is requested to add 
   the values described in Section 2 to their MIKEY Payload Name Space.
