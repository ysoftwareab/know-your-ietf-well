              NSEC and NSEC3 TTLs and NSEC Aggressive Use
                      draft-ietf-dnsop-nsec-ttl-05

Abstract

   Due to a combination of unfortunate wording in earlier documents,
   aggressive use of NSEC and NSEC3 records may deny the existence of
   names far beyond the intended lifetime of a denial.  This document
   changes the definition of the NSEC and NSEC3 TTL (Time To Live) to
   correct that situation.  This document updates RFC 4034, RFC 4035,
   RFC 5155, and RFC 8198.

Internet-Draft                  nsec-ttl                        May 2021


   This document lives on GitHub (https://github.com/PowerDNS/draft-
   dnsop-nsec-ttl); proposed text and editorial changes are very much
   welcomed there, but any functional changes should always first be
   discussed on the IETF DNSOP WG mailing list.

   ]

   [RFC2308] defines the TTL of the SOA (Start Of Authority) record that
   must be returned in negative answers (NXDOMAIN or NODATA):

   |  The TTL of this record is set from the minimum of the MINIMUM
   |  field of the SOA record and the TTL of the SOA itself, and
   |  indicates how long a resolver may cache the negative answer.

   Thus, if the TTL of the SOA in the zone is lower than the SOA MINIMUM
   value (the last number in the SOA record), the authoritative server
   sends that lower value as the TTL of the returned SOA record.  The
   resolver always uses the TTL of the returned SOA record when setting
   the negative TTL in its cache.

   However, [RFC4034] section 4 has this unfortunate text:

   |  The NSEC RR SHOULD have the same TTL value as the SOA minimum TTL
   |  field.  This is in the spirit of negative caching ([RFC2308]).

   This text, while referring to RFC2308, can cause NSEC records to have
   much higher TTLs than the appropriate negative TTL for a zone.
   [RFC5155] contains equivalent text.

   [RFC8198] section 5.4 tries to correct this:

   |  Section 5 of [RFC2308] also states that a negative cache entry TTL
   |  is taken from the minimum of the SOA.MINIMUM field and SOA's TTL.
   |  This can be less than the TTL of an NSEC or NSEC3 record, since
   |  their TTL is equal to the SOA.MINIMUM field (see [RFC4035],
   |  Section 2.3 and [RFC5155], Section 3).
   |  
   |  A resolver that supports aggressive use of NSEC and NSEC3 SHOULD
   |  reduce the TTL of NSEC and NSEC3 records to match the SOA.MINIMUM
   |  field in the authority section of a negative response, if
   |  SOA.MINIMUM is smaller.

   But the NSEC and NSEC3 RRs should, according to RFC4034 and RFC5155,
   already be at the value of the MINIMUM field in the SOA.  Thus, the
   advice from RFC8198 would not actually change the TTL used for the
   NSEC and NSEC3 RRs for authoritative servers that follow the RFCs.

Internet-Draft                  nsec-ttl                        May 2021


   As a theoretical exercise, consider a TLD named ".example" with a SOA
   record like this:

   "example.  900 IN SOA primary.example. hostmaster.example. 1 1800 900
   604800 86400"

   The SOA record has a 900 second TTL, and a 86400 MINIMUM TTL.
   Negative responses from this zone have a 900 second TTL, but the NSEC
   or NSEC3 records in those negative responses have a 86400 TTL.  If a
   resolver were to use those NSEC or NSEC3 records aggressively, they
   would be considered valid for a day, instead of the intended 15
   minutes.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  NSEC and NSEC3 TTL changes

   The existing texts in [RFC4034], [RFC4035], and [RFC5155] use the
   SHOULD requirement level, but they were written when [RFC4035] still
   said 'However, it seems prudent for resolvers to avoid blocking new
   authoritative data or synthesizing new data on their own'.  [RFC8198]
   updated that text to contain 'DNSSEC-enabled validating resolvers
   SHOULD use wildcards and NSEC/NSEC3 resource records to generate
   positive and negative responses until the effective TTLs or
   signatures for those records expire'.  This means that correctness of
   NSEC and NSEC3 records, and their TTLs, has become much more
   important.  Because of that, the updates in this document upgrade the
   requirement level to MUST.

3.1.  Updates to RFC4034

   Where [RFC4034] says:

   |  The NSEC RR SHOULD have the same TTL value as the SOA minimum TTL
   |  field.  This is in the spirit of negative caching ([RFC2308]).

   This is updated to say:

Internet-Draft                  nsec-ttl                        May 2021


   |  The TTL of the NSEC RR that is returned MUST be the lesser of the
   |  MINIMUM field of the SOA record and the TTL of the SOA itself.
   |  This matches the definition of the TTL for negative responses in
   |  [RFC2308].  Because some signers incrementally update the NSEC
   |  chain, a transient inconsistency between the observed and expected
   |  TTL MAY exist.

3.2.  Updates to RFC4035

   Where [RFC4035] says:

   |  The TTL value for any NSEC RR SHOULD be the same as the minimum
   |  TTL value field in the zone SOA RR.

   This is updated to say:

   |  The TTL of the NSEC RR that is returned MUST be the lesser of the
   |  MINIMUM field of the SOA record and the TTL of the SOA itself.
   |  This matches the definition of the TTL for negative responses in
   |  [RFC2308].  Because some signers incrementally update the NSEC
   |  chain, a transient inconsistency between the observed and expected
   |  TTL MAY exist.

3.3.  Updates to RFC5155

   Where [RFC5155] says:

   |  The NSEC3 RR SHOULD have the same TTL value as the SOA minimum TTL
   |  field.  This is in the spirit of negative caching [RFC2308].

   This is updated to say:

   |  The TTL of the NSEC3 RR that is returned MUST be the lesser of the
   |  MINIMUM field of the SOA record and the TTL of the SOA itself.
   |  This matches the definition of the TTL for negative responses in
   |  [RFC2308].  Because some signers incrementally update the NSEC3
   |  chain, a transient inconsistency between the observed and expected
   |  TTL MAY exist.

   Where [RFC5155] says:

   |  o The TTL value for any NSEC3 RR SHOULD be the same as the minimum
   |  TTL value field in the zone SOA RR.

   This is updated to say:

Internet-Draft                  nsec-ttl                        May 2021


   |  o The TTL value for each NSEC3 RR MUST be the lesser of the
   |  MINIMUM field of the zone SOA RR and the TTL of the zone SOA RR
   |  itself.  Because some signers incrementally update the NSEC3
   |  chain, a transient inconsistency between the observed and expected
   |  TTL MAY exist.

3.4.  Updates to RFC8198

   [RFC8198] section 5.4 (Consideration on TTL) is completely replaced
   by the following text:

   |  The TTL value of negative information is especially important,
   |  because newly added domain names cannot be used while the negative
   |  information is effective.
   |  
   |  Section 5 of [RFC2308] suggests a maximum default negative cache
   |  TTL value of 3 hours (10800).  It is RECOMMENDED that validating
   |  resolvers limit the maximum effective TTL value of negative
   |  responses (NSEC/NSEC3 RRs) to this same value.
   |  
   |  A resolver that supports aggressive use of NSEC and NSEC3 MAY
   |  limit the TTL of NSEC and NSEC3 records to the lesser of the
   |  SOA.MINIMUM field and the TTL of the SOA in a response, if
   |  present.  It MAY also use a previously cached SOA for a zone to
   |  find these values.

   (The third paragraph of the original is removed, and the fourth
   paragraph is updated to allow resolvers to also take the lesser of
   the SOA TTL and SOA MINIMUM.)

4.  Zone Operator Considerations

   If signers and DNS servers for a zone cannot immediately be updated
   to conform to this document, zone operators are encouraged to
   consider setting their SOA record TTL and the SOA MINIMUM field to
   the same value.  That way, the TTL used for aggressive NSEC and NSEC3
   use matches the SOA TTL for negative responses.

   Note that some signers might use the SOA TTL or MINIMUM as a default
   for other values, such as the TTL for DNSKEY records.  Operators
   should consult documentation before changing values.

4.1.  A Note On Wildcards

   Validating resolvers consider an expanded wildcard valid for the
   wildcard's TTL, capped by the TTLs of the NSEC or NSEC3 proof that
   shows that the wildcard expansion is legal.  Thus, changing the TTL
   of NSEC or NSEC3 records (explicitly, or by implementation of this
   document, implicitly) might affect (shorten) the lifetime of
   wildcards.

5.  Security Considerations

   An attacker can delay future records from appearing in a cache by
   seeding the cache with queries that cause NSEC or NSEC3 responses to
   be cached for aggressive use purposes.  This document reduces the
   impact of that attack in cases where the NSEC or NSEC3 TTL is higher
   than the zone operator intended.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add a reference to this document in the
   "Resource Record (RR) TYPEs" subregistry of the "Domain Name System
   (DNS) Parameters" registry, for the NSEC and NSEC3 types.
