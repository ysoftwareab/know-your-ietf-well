1. Introduction

   This document introduces a YANG [RFC6020] data model grouping for
   configuration scheduling. This grouping can be used in other YANG
   data models to specify a schedule applied on a configuration schema
   node, so that the schema node can take effect according to the
   schedule.

1.1. Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14, [RFC2119].

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6020] and are not redefined
   here:

      o  augment

      o  data model

      o  data node

2. Motivation

   Some applications benefit from resource scheduling to allow operators
   to plan ahead of time. Traffic engineering is one of such examples
   [RFC7399]. When configuration and state models are designed for such
   applications, it has been considered that certain data objects need
   to be configured according to predefined schedules. In other
   situations, operators need to de-configure certain data objects at
   predefined schedules for the purposes such as maintenance. These data
   objects are interpreted and implemented by the applicable
   applications.

3. Configuration Scheduling YANG Data Model Overview

   This document defines a grouping "schedules" in the YANG module
   "ietf-schedule".  Specifying this grouping for a YANG schema node
   allows to specify configuration schedules for the data objects
   modeled by this schema node. When such a schedule exists, system will
   configure the specified object according to the specified schedule.
   The grouping has the following structure:

   module: ietf-schedule
   grouping schedules:
   +--rw schedules
      +--rw schedule* [schedule-id]
         +--rw schedule-id            uint32
         +--rw inclusive-exclusive?   enumeration
         +--rw start?                 yang:date-and-time
         +--rw schedule-duration?     string
         +--rw repeat-interval?       string

4. Usage Example

   The following model defines a list of TE (Traffic Engineering) links
   which can be configured with specified schedules:

   +--rw te-link* [id]
      +--rw id           string
      +--rw schedules

Internet-Draft     draft-liu-netmod-yang-schedule-01     September 2017


         +--rw schedule* [schedule-id]
            +--rw schedule-id            uint32
            +--rw inclusive-exclusive?   enumeration
            +--rw start?                 yang:date-and-time
            +--rw schedule-duration?     string
            +--rw repeat-interval?       String

   The following configuration requests that

      o  link-1 is configured weekly for five one-day periods, starting
         from 2016-09-12T23:20:50.52Z.

      o  link-1 is de-configured for two hours, starting from 2016-09-
         15T01:00:00.00Z.

   <te-link>
     <id>link-1</id>
     <schedules>
       <schedule>
         <schedule-id>11<schedule-id>
         <start>2016-09-12T23:20:50.52Z</start>
         <schedule-duration>P1D</schedule-duration>
         <repeat-interval>R5/P1W</repeat-interval>
         <schedule>
     </schedules>
   </te-link>
   <te-link>
     <id>link-2</id>
     <schedules>
       <schedule-id>12<schedule-id>
       <inclusive-exclusive>exclusive</inclusive-exclusive>
       <start>2016-09-15T01:00:00.00Z</start>
       <schedule-duration>P2H</schedule-duration>
     </schedules>

6. Security Considerations

   The configuration, state, action and notification data defined in
   this document are designed to be accessed via the NETCONF protocol
   [RFC6241]. The data-model by itself does not create any security
   implications. The security considerations for the NETCONF protocol

Internet-Draft     draft-liu-netmod-yang-schedule-01     September 2017


   are applicable. The NETCONF protocol used for sending the data
   supports authentication and encryption.
