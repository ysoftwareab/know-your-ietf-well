Abstract

   This Internet-Draft proposes an extension to SMTP for an electronic
   mail equivalent to the real-world "No Soliciting" sign. In addition
   to the service extension, a new message header and extensions to the
   existing "received" message header are described.

Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].

1. Introduction

1.1 The Spam Pandemic

   Unsolicited Bulk Email (UBE), otherwise known as spam, has become as
   one of the most pressing issues on the Internet.  One oft-quoted
   study estimated that spam would cost businesses $13 billion in
   2003.[Ferris] In April 2003, AOL reported that it had blocked 2.37
   billion pieces of UBE in a single day.[CNET] And, in a sure sign that
   UBE has become of pressing concern, numerous politicians have begun
   to issue pronouncements and prescriptions for fighting this
   epidemic.[Schumer][FTC]

   A variety of mechanisms from the technical community have been
   proposed and/or implemented to fight UBE:

   o  Whitelists are lists of known non-spammers.  For example, Habeas,
      Inc. maintains a Habeas User List (HUL) of people who have agreed
      to not spam.  By including a haiku in email headers and enforcing
      copyright on that ditty, they enforce their anti-spamming terms of
      service.[Habeas]

   o  Blacklists are lists of known spammers or ISPs that allow
      spam.[ROKSO]

   o  Spam filters run client-side or server-side to filter out spam
      based on whitelists, blacklists, and textual and header
      analysis.[Assassin]

   o  A large number of documents address the overall technical
      considerations for the control of
      UBE[I-D.crocker-spam-techconsider], operational considerations for
      SMTP agents[RFC2505], and various extensions to the protocols to
      support UBE identification and filtering.
      [I-D.danisch-dns-rr-smtp][I-D.daboo-sieve-spamtest][I-D.crouzet-amtp]

   o  Various proposals have been advanced for "do not spam" lists, akin
      to the Federal Trade Commission's "Do Not Call" list for
      telemarketers.[FTC.TSR]


1.2 No Soliciting in the Real World

   Municipalities frequently require solicitors to register with the
   town government.  And, in many cases, the municipalities prohibit
   soliciting in residences where the occupant has posted a sign.  The
   town of West Newbury, Massachusetts, for example, requires:




Malamud                  Expires August 8, 2004                 [Page 3]

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit                  February 2004


      "It shall be unlawful for any canvasser or solicitor to enter the
      premises of a resident or business who has displayed a 'No
      Trespassing' or 'No Soliciting' sign or poster.  Further, it shall
      be unlawful for canvassers or solicitors to ignore a resident or
      business person's no solicitation directive or remain on private
      property after its owner has indicated that the canvasser or
      solicitor is not welcome."[Newbury]

   Registration requirements for solicitors, particularly those
   soliciting for political or religious reasons, have been the subject
   of a long string of court cases.  However, the courts have generally
   recognized that individuals may post "No Soliciting" signs and the
   government may enforce the citizen's desire. In a recent case where
   Jehovah's Witnesses challenged a registration requirement in the city
   of Stratton, Connecticut, saying they derived their authority from
   the Scriptures, not the city.  However, the court noted:

      "A section of the ordinance that petitioners do not challenge
      establishes a procedure by which a resident may prohibit
      solicitation even by holders of permits. If the resident files a
      'No Solicitation Registration Form' with the mayor, and also posts
      a 'No Solicitation' sign on his property, no uninvited canvassers
      may enter his property ..."[Watchtower]

   Even government, which has a duty to promote free expression, may
   restrict the use of soliciting on government property. In one case,
   for example, a school district was allowed to give access to its
   internal electronic mail system to the union that was representing
   teachers, but was not required to do so to a rival union that was
   attempting to gain the right to represent the teachers.  The court
   held that where property is not a traditional public forum "and the
   Government has not dedicated its property to First Amendment
   activity, such regulation is examined only for
   reasonableness."[Perry]

   The courts have consistently held that the state has a compelling
   public safety reason for regulating solicitation.  In Cantwell v.
   Connecticut, the Supreme Court held that "a State may protect its
   citizens from fraudulent solicitation by requiring a stranger in the
   community, before permitting him publicly to solicit funds for any
   purpose, to establish his identity and his authority to act for the
   cause which he purports to represent."[Cantwell] And, in Martin v.
   City of Struthers, the court noted that "burglars frequently pose as
   canvassers, either in order that they may have a pretense to discover
   whether a house is empty and hence ripe for burglary, or for the
   purpose of spying out the premises in order that they may return
   later."[Martin] The public safety issue applies very much to email,
   where viruses can easily be delivered, in contrast to telephone

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit                  February 2004


   solicitations where public safety is not nearly as much an issue.

   This analysis is U.S.-centric, which is partly due to the background
   of the author. However, the concept of prohibiting unwanted
   solicitation does carry over to other countries:

   o  In Hong Kong, offices frequently post "no soliciting" signs.

   o  In the United Kingdom, where door-to-door peddlers are fairly
      common, "no soliciting" signs are also common.

   o  In Australia, where door-to-door does not appear to be a pressing
      social problem, there was legislation passed which outlawed the
      practice of placing ads under wipers of parked cars.

   o  In France, which has a long tradition of door-to-door
      solicitation, apartment buildings often use trespass laws to
      enforce "no solicitation" policies.

   o  In the Netherlands, where door-to-door solicitation is not a
      pressing issue, there is a practice of depositing free
      publications in mailboxes.  The postal equivalent of "no spam"
      signs are quite prevalent and serve notice that the publications
      are not desired.


1.3 No Soliciting and Electronic Mail

   Many of the anti-spam proposals that have been advanced have great
   merit, however none of them give notice to an SMTP agent in the
   process of delivering mail that the receiver does not wish to receive
   solicitations. Such a virtual sign would serve two purposes:

   o  It would allow the receiving system to "serve notice" that a
      certain class of electronic mail is not desired.

   o  If a message is properly identified as belonging to a certain
      class and that class of messages is not desired, transfer of the
      message can be eliminated.  Rather than filtering after delivery,
      elimination of the message transfer can save network bandwidth,
      disk space, and processing power.

   This memo details a series of extensions to SMTP that have the
   following characteristics:

   o  A service extension is described that allows a receiving Mail
      Transport Agent (MTA) to signal the sending MTA that no soliciting
      is in effect.



Malamud                  Expires August 8, 2004                 [Page 5]

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit                  February 2004


   o  A header field for the sender of the message is defined that
      allows the sender to flag a message as conforming to a certain
      class.

   o  Trace fields for intermediate MTAs are extended to allow the
      intermediate MTA to signal that a message is in a certain class.

   Allowing the sender of a message to tag a message as being, for
   example, unsolicited commercial email with adult content, allows
   "good" spammers to conform to legal content labelling requirements by
   governmental authorities, license agreements with service providers,
   or conventions imposed by "whitelist" services.  For senders of mail
   who choose not to abide by these conventions, the intermediate trace
   fields defined here allow the destination MTAs to perform appropriate
   dispositions on the received message.

   This extension provides a simple mean for senders, MTAs, and
   receivers to assert keywords drawn from a common registry. This
   extension does not deal with any issues of authentication or consent.

2. The No-Soliciting SMTP Service Extension

   Per [RFC2821], a "NO-SOLICITING" SMTP service extension is defined.
   The service extension is declared during the initial "EHLO" SMTP
   exchange.  The extension has one optional parameter, consisting of
   zero or more solicitation class keywords.  Using the notation as
   described in the Augmented BNF[RFC2234], the syntax is:

     No-Soliciting-Service = "NO-SOLICITING"
          [ SP Solicitation-keywords ]

   As will be further described below, the "Solicitation-keywords"
   construct is used to indicate which classes of messages are not
   desired. A keyword that is presented during the initial "EHLO"
   exchange applies to all messages exchanged in this session. As will
   also be further described below, additional keywords may be specified
   on a per-recipient basis as part of the response to a "RCPT TO"
   command.

2.1 The EHLO Exchange

   Keywords presented during the initial exchange indicate that no
   soliciting in the named classes is in effect for all messages
   delivered to this system.  It is equivalent to the sign on the door
   of an office building announcing a company-wide policy.  For example:

     R: <wait for connection on TCP port 25>
     S: <open connection to server>
     R: 220 trusted.example.com SMTP service ready
     S: EHLO untrusted.example.com
     R: 250-trusted.example.com says hello
     R: 250-ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES
     R: 250-NO-SOLICITING ADV
     R: 250 SIZE 20480000

   The "ADV" parameter to the "NO-SOLICITING" extension is an example of
   a solicitation class keyword, the syntax of which is described in the
   following section. The example values are drawn from the
   non-normative appendix in Appendix B.

   Historical Note:

      A similar proposal was advanced in 1999 by John Levine and Paul
      Hoffman.  This proposal used the SMTP greeting banner to specify
      that unsolicited bulk email is prohibited on a particular system
      through the use of the "NO UCE" keyword.[Levine]  As the authors
      note, their proposal has the potential of overloading the
      semantics of the greeting banner, which may also be used for other



Malamud                  Expires August 8, 2004                 [Page 7]

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit                  February 2004


      purposes (see, e.g., [Malamud]).


2.2 Solicitation Class Keywords

   The "NO-SOLICITING" service extension uses solicitation class
   keywords to signify classes of solicitations that are not accepted.
   Solicitation class keywords are separated by commas.

   There is no default solicitation class keyword for the service.  In
   other words, the following example is a "no-op":

     R: 250-NO-SOLICITING

   While the above example is a "no-op" it is useful for an MTA that
   wishes to pass along all messages, but would also like to pass along
   "SOLICIT=" parameters on a message-by-message basis.  The above
   example invokes the use of the extension but does not signal any
   restrictions by class of message.

   Solicitation class keywords may be defined and registered as
   specified in Section 4.3. Multiple solicitation class keywords are
   separated by a comma to form a list, which has a maximum length of
   200 characters:

     Solicitation-keywords = registered-word 0*("," registered-word)
          ; length of this string is limited to <= 200 characters
     registered-word = ALPHA 0*(wordchar)
          ; registered-word(s) are registered
          ; with the IANA
     wordchar = ("-" / "_" / ":" / ALPHA / DIGIT)

   Developers should note that a "registered-word" MAY contain a
   trailing wild card as part of the specification.  See Section 4.3.1
   for more details.

   Several example solicitation class keywords are used throughout this
   document and are further described in the non-normative Appendix B.

2.2.1 Note on Choice of Solicitation Class Keywords

   This document does not specify which solicitation class keywords
   shall or shall not be used on a particular message.  The requirement
   to use a particular keyword is a policy decision well outside the
   scope of this document.  In particular, the three keywords described
   in this document are for illustrative purposes only and it is
   expected that relevant policy bodies (e.g., governments, ISPs,
   developers, or others) will specify appropriate keywords, the



Malamud                  Expires August 8, 2004                 [Page 8]

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit                  February 2004


   definition of the meaning of those keywords, and any other policy
   requirements, such as a requirement to use or not use this extension
   in particular circumstances.

2.3 The MAIL FROM Command

   "SOLICIT" is defined as a parameter for the "MAIL FROM" command.  The
   "SOLICIT" parameter is followed by an equal sign and a comma
   separated list of solicitation class keywords. The syntax for this
   parameter is:

     Mail-From-Solicit-Parameter = "SOLICIT"
                             "=" Solicitation-keywords
     ; Solicitation-keywords, when used in MAIL FROM command
     ; MUST be identical to those in the Solicitation: header.

   Note that white space is not permitted in this production.

   As an informational message, the "550" or "250" replies to the "RCPT
   TO" command may also contain the "SOLICIT" parameter. If a message is
   being rejected due to a solicitation class keyword match,
   implementations SHOULD echo which solicitation classes are in effect.
   See Section 2.4 for more on error reporting.

   The receiving system may decide on a per-message basis the
   appropriate disposition of messages:

     R: <wait for connection on TCP port 25>
     S: <open connection to server>
     R: 220 trusted.example.com SMTP service ready
     S: EHLO untrusted.example.com
     R: 250-trusted.example.com says hello
     R: 250-NO-SOLICITING ADV
     S: MAIL FROM:<save@burntmail.example.com> SOLICIT=ADV:ADLT
     S: RCPT TO:<coupon_clipper@moonlink.example.com>
     R: 250 <coupon_clipper@moonlink.example.com>... Recipient ok
     S: RCPT TO:<grumpy_old_boy@moonlink.example.com>
     R: 550 <grumpy_old_boy@moonlink.example.com> SOLICIT=ADV:ADLT

   In the previous example, the receiving MTA returned a "550" status
   code, indicating that one message was being rejected.  The
   implementation also echoes back the currently set keywords for that
   user on the "550" status message. The solicitation class keyword
   which is echoed back is "ADV:ADLT" which illustrates how this
   per-recipient solicitation class keyword has supplemented the base
   "ADV" class declared in the "EHLO" exchange.

   It is the responsibility of a receiving MTA to maintain a consistent



Malamud                  Expires August 8, 2004                 [Page 9]

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit                  February 2004


   policy.  If the receiving MTA will reject a message because of
   solicitation class keywords, the MTA SHOULD declare those keywords
   either in the initial "EHLO" exchange or on a per-recipient basis.
   Likewise, a receiving MTA SHOULD NOT deliver a message where the
   "Solicitation:" matches a solicitation class keyword that was
   presented during the initial "EHLO" exchange or on a per-recipient
   basis.

   Developers should also note that the source of the solicitation class
   keywords used in the "MAIL FROM" command MUST be the "Solicitation:"
   header described in Section 2.5 and MUST NOT be supplemented by
   additional solicitation class keywords derived from the "Received:"
   header trace fields which are described in Section 2.6.

2.4 Error Reporting and Enhanced Mail Status Codes

   If a session between two MTAs is using both the "NO-SOLICITING"
   extension and the Enhanced Mail Status Codes as defined in [RFC3463]
   and a message is rejected based on the presence of a "SOLICIT"
   parameter, the correct error message to return will usually be
   "5.7.1", defined as "the sender is not authorized to send to the
   destination ... [because] of per-host or per-recipient filtering."

   Other codes, including temporary status codes, may be more
   appropriate in some circumstances and developers should look to
   [RFC3463] on this subject.  An example of such a situation might be
   the use of quotas or size restrictions on messages by class. An
   implementation MAY impose limits such as message size restrictions
   based on solicitation classes, and when such limits are exceed they
   SHOULD be reported using whatever status code is appropriate for that
   limit.

   In all cases, an implementation SHOULD include a
   "Mail-From-Solicit-Parameter" on a "550" or other reply that rejects
   message delivery. The parameter SHOULD includes the solicitation
   class keyword(s) that matched. In addition to the solicitation class
   keyword(s) that matched, an implementation MAY include additional
   solicitation class keywords that are in effect.

2.5 Solicitation Mail Header

   Per [RFC2822], a new "Solicitation:" header field is defined which
   contains one or more solicitation class keywords.

      Solicitation-header = "Solicitation:" 1*SP Solicitation-keywords

   An example of this header follows:




Malamud                  Expires August 8, 2004                [Page 10]

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit                  February 2004


     To: Coupon Clipper <coupon_clipper@moonlink.example.com>
     From: Spam King <save@burntmail.example.com>
     Solicitation: ADV,ADV:ADLT

   Several proposals, particularly legal ones, have suggested requiring
   the use of keywords in the "Subject:" header. While embedding
   information in the "Subject:" header may provide visual cues to end
   users, it does not provide a straightforward set of cues for computer
   programs such as mail transfer agents. As with embedding a "no
   solicitation" message in a greeting banner, this overloads the
   semantics of the "Subject:" header.  Of course, there is no reason
   why both mechanisms can't be used, and in any case the
   "Solicitation:" header could be automatically inserted by the
   sender's Mail User Agent (MUA) based on the contents of the subject
   line.

2.6 Insertion of Solicitation Keywords in Trace Fields

   The "Solicitation:" mail header is only available to the sending
   client.  RFCs 2821 and 2822 are quite specific that intermediate MTAs
   shall not change message headers, with the sole exception of the
   "Received:" trace field.  Since many current systems use an
   intermediate relay to detect unsolicited mail, an addition to the
   "Received:" header is described.

   [RFC2821] documents the following productions for the "Received:"
   header in a mail message:

     ; From RFC 2821
     With = "WITH" FWS Protocol CFWS
     Protocol = "ESMTP" / "SMTP" / Attdl-Protocol

   Additionally, [RFC2822] defines a comment field as follows:

     ; From RFC 2822
     comment         =       "(" *([FWS] ccontent) [FWS] ")"
     ccontent        =       ctext / quoted-pair / comment

   The "Mail-From-Solicit-Parameter" defined in Section 2.3 above is a
   restricted form of ctext, yielding the following production:

   An example of a Received: header from a conforming MTA is as follows:

     Received: by foo-mta.example.com with
        ESMTP (SOLICIT=ADV,ADV:ADLT) ; Sat, 9 Aug 2003
        16:54:42 -0700 (PDT)

   It should be noted that keywords presented in trace fields may not
   agree with those found in the "Solicitation:" header and trace fields
   may exist even if the header is not present. When determing which
   keywords are applicable to a particular exchange of messages,
   implementors SHOULD examine any keywords found in the "Solicitation:"
   header.  Implementors MAY examine other keywords found in the trace
   fields.

2.7 Relay of Messages

   The "NO-SOLICITING" service extension, if present, applies to all
   messages handled by the receiving Message Transfer Agent (MTA),
   including those messages intended to be relayed to another system.

   Solicitation class keywords supplied by a client on a "SOLICIT"
   parameter on a "MAIL FROM" command SHOULD be obtained from the
   "Solicitation:" field in the message header.  An SMTP client SHOULD,
   however, verify that the list of solicitation class keywords obtained
   from the "Solicitation:" field uses valid syntax before conveying its
   contents. An SMTP server SHOULD set this parameter after detecting
   the presence of the "Solicitation:" header field when receiving a
   message from a non-conforming MTA.

2.8 No Default Solicitation Class

   Implementations of "NO-SOLICITING" service extension SHOULD NOT
   enable specific solicitation class keywords as a default in their
   software.  There are some indications that some policy makers may
   view a default filtering in software as a prior restraint on
   commercial speech. In other words, because the person installing and
   using the software did not make an explicit choice to enable a
   certain type of filtering, some might argue that such filtering was
   not desired.

   Likewise, it is recommended that a system administrator installing
   software SHOULD NOT enable additional per-recipient filtering by
   default for a user.  Again, individual users should specifically
   request any additional solicitation class keywords.

   The mechanism for an individual user to communicate their desire to
   enable certain types of filtering is outside the scope of this
   document.

3. Security Considerations

   This extension does not provide authentication of senders or other
   measures intended to promote security measures during the message
   exchange process.

   In particular, this document does not address the circumstances under
   which a sender of electronic mail should or should not use this
   extension and does not address the issues of whether consent to send
   mail has been granted.

   This might lead to a scenario in which a sender of electronic mail
   begins to use this extension well before the majority of end users
   have begun to use it.  In this scenario, the sender might wish to use
   the absence of the extension on the receiving MTA as an implication
   of consent to receive mail. Non-use of the "NO-SOLICITING" extension
   by a receiving MTA SHALL NOT indicate consent.

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit                  February 2004


4. IANA Considerations

   There are four IANA considerations presented in this draft:

   1.  Addition of the "NO-SOLICITING" service extension to the Mail
       Parameters registry.

   2.  Documentation of the use of comments in trace fields.

   3.  Creation of a Solicitation Class Keywords registry.

   4.  Creation of a "Solicitation:" mail header, which does not
       currently raise any IANA considerations.


4.1 The Mail Parameters Registry

   The IANA Mail Parameters registry documents SMTP service extensions.
   The "NO-SOLICITATION" service extension would need to be added to
   this registry as follows.

     Keywords        Description                     Reference
     ------------    ------------------------------  ---------
     NO-SOLICITING   Notification of no soliciting.  [XXXX]

   The parameters subregistry would need to be modified as follows:

     Service Ext    EHLO Keyword   Parameters            Reference
     -----------    ------------   -----------           ---------
     No Soliciting  NO-SOLICITING  Solicitation-keywords [XXXX]

   The maximum length of Solicitation-keywords is 200 characters. The
   "SOLICIT=" parameter is defined for use on the MAIL FROM command. The
   potential length of the MAIL FROM command is thus increased by 207
   characters.

4.2 Trace Fields

   The Mail Parameters registry would need to be modified to note the
   use of the comment facility in trace fields to indicate Solicitation
   Class Keywords.

4.3 The Solicitation Class Keywords Registry

   A new registry (or a subregistry of Mail Parameters) would need to be
   established for Solicitation Class Keywords.  The registry would
   contain the following fields:

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit                  February 2004


   1.  Solicitation Class Keyword Name

   2.  Solicitation Class Keyword Description

   3.  Solicitation Class Keyword Reference

   The Name field conforms to the syntax of the "Solicitation-keywords"
   in Section 2.2 of this draft. The Description field consists of text.
   The Reference field should include a URI with further information.

   Per the policies outlined in [RFC2434], it is recommended that the
   IESG request the IANA to appoint a Designated Expert to administer
   this registry.  Authority for solicitation class keywords in this
   registry will come in some cases from published RFCs, but in other
   cases will come from applicable laws or regulations.  It is
   recommended that any non-RFC derived solicitation class keywords be
   documented in future informational RFCs to provide a consistent set
   of references.

   Policies for the administration of this registry shall be developed
   by the IANA and may include the automated processing of registration
   requests.

4.3.1 Guidance on Keyword Specification

   A set of keywords beginning with a common prefix may be registered
   with the IANA by specifying the prefix followed by wild card
   specified as a single asterisk ("*") and shall be considered a single
   registry entry.  The "keyword reference" field of the registry SHOULD
   contain a reference that documents the values this solicitation class
   keyword may contain if the trailing wild card is specified in the
   "keyword name" field of the registry.

      Note to Developers: In designing client and server solutions based
      on this extension, it is important to remember to design your code
      to take into account the possible use of these trailing wildcards.
      See the "Solicitation-keywords" production in Section 2.2 for
      valid characters and delimiters.

   This facility can be used to insert a "score" or category tag by an
   intermediate MTA.  For example, a solicitation class keyword "WMA:*"
   might be used as follows:

     Received: by foo-mta.example.com with
        ESMTP (WMA:SBRule:Haven_Domain,WMA:SBScore:10) ; Sat, 9 Aug 2003
        16:54:42 -0700 (PDT)

   Because of the wildcard provision, the IANA MAY require that each

draft-malamud-no-soliciting    No-Solicit                  February 2004


   solicitation class keyword name have a unique beginning sequence. For
   example, registering sequences such as "ADV" and "ADV:ADLT" as
   different names might require implementations to differentiate
   between classes that use a wildcard and those that do not.

4.4 The Solicitation Mail Header

   There is currently no registry defined for mail headers.  If such a
   registry were to exist, the "Solicitation:" header field would need
   to be added to it.

5. Author's Acknowledgements

   The author would like to thank Rebecca Malamud for many discussions
   and ideas that led to this proposal and to John C. Klensin and
   Marshall T. Rose for their extensive input on how it could be
   properly implemented in SMTP.  Eric Allman, Steven M.  Bellovin, Kent
   Crispin, Dave Crocker, Ned Freed, Curtis Generous, Arnt Gulbrandsen,
   John Levine, Keith Moore, Hector Santos, Paul Vixie, and Pindar Wong
   kindly provided reviews of the draft and/or suggestions for
   improvement. Information about soliciting outside the U.S. was
   received from Rob Blokzijl, Jon Crowcroft, Christian Huitema, Geoff
   Huston, and Pindar Wong.  John Levine pointed out the contrast
   between this proposal and "do not spam" lists.  As always, all errors
   and omissions are the responsibility of the author.

Appendix B. Example Solicitation Class Keywords (Non-Normative)

   Three examples are given in this appendix which are based on existing
   ad hoc labeling conventions in use.  These three examples should not
   form part of the initial registry. This section is non-normative and
   is not part of the definition of the extension.  The three
   solicitation class keywords defined for use as examples only in this
   draft are:

   Keywords  Description                       Reference
   --------- --------------------------------  ---------
   MAPS-UBE  Unsolicited Bulk Email            http://mail-abuse.org/
   ADV       Unsolicited Commercial Email      http://www.spamlaws.com/
   ADV:ADLT  Sexually Explicit Commercial Mail http://www.spamlaws.com/

   MAPS-UBE is the standard advanced by the Mail Abuse Prevention System
   LLC (MAPS), [1] which states:

      An electronic message is "spam" IF: (1) the recipient's personal
      identity and context are irrelevant because the message is equally
      applicable to many other potential recipients; AND (2) the
      recipient has not verifiably granted deliberate, explicit, and
      still-revocable permission for it to be sent; AND (3) the
      transmission and reception of the message appears to the recipient
      to give a disproportionate benefit to the sender.

   Numerous states have adopted the "ADV" and "ADV:ADLT" conventions.
   We cite the spamlaws.com site as a reference because it provides an
   excellent summary of the definitions and pointers to the relevant
   statutes.

      decision to reject a message is only taken by a recipient and that
      the particular decision to take is outside the scope of this
      draft.

   o  Section 3 ("Use of the Extension") of the previous draft has been

      clear that a set of keywords is not presented when the
      "PER-RECIPIENT" option is used. See Section 2.

   o  A Note on Keywords has been added to make clear that the initial
