Internet-Draft          EAI Deployment Practices               June 2009


1.  Introduction

   IETF EAI WG has published 5 RFCs [RFC4952] [RFC5335] [RFC5336]
   [RFC5337] [RFC5504].  These RFCs specifie a protocol for
   internationalized email address.  The goal of this document is to
   clarify the EAI protocols, give some suggestions and guide the
   implementations.  It highlights areas where EAI implementers may
   think it is valuable.  As well as clarifications to standards text,
   this document also mentions potential choices that can be made, in an
   attempt to help to foster interworking between components that use
   this protocol.  EAI extends the current base email standards
   [RFC2821] [RFC2822].  It is important for EAI implementers to carry
   out a thorough analysis of all of the existing EMAIL standard
   documents to understand the relationships between the base email
   standards and the current EAI protocols.  A great deal of the advice
   for making the protocol more practical is available to those who want
   to deploy the EAI protocols.

1.1.  Role of this specification

   The framework document specifies the requirements for, and describes
   components of, full internationalization of email address.  The EAI
   SMTP extension document [RFC5336] specifys the SMTP extension to use
   the internationalized email address.  The EAI header document
   [RFC5335] allows the internationalized email address headers.  The
   EAI downgrade document [RFC5504] addresses how to downgrade to be
   compatible with the current non-EAI-system.  A thorough understanding
   of the information in all these documents and in the base Internet
   email specifications [RFC2821] [RFC2822] is necessary to understand
   and implement this specification.

   This document clarifys some points in the EAI protocols and gives
   some suggestions and advice for the usage, implementation and
   deployment of internationalized email address.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   All the specialized terms used in this specification are defined in
   the framework document [RFC4952], the EAI SMTP extension document
   [RFC5336], the EAI header document [RFC5335] and the base Internet
   email specifications [RFC2821] [RFC2822].  In particular, the terms
   "ASCII user", and "i18mail user" are used in this document according
   to the definitions in the framework one.

   [[anchor3: NOTE TO RFC EDITOR: Please remove the following text
   before publication.]]
   Some ideas of this specification is being discussed on the EAI
   mailing list.  See https://www1.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ima for
   information about subscribing.  The list's archive is at
   http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ima/index.html.


2.  Deployment

2.1.  From non-EAI world to EAI world

   An i18mail user normally uses the EAI-capability sending server which
   his internationalized email address resides in.  It is very unlikely
   that the i18mail user use the non-EAI-capability server to send its
   i18mail message.  If that situations occures, the sending server will
   reject the message or report it as an error.  EAI Protocols are used
   to exchange the message between at least 2 SMTP servers.  If only one
   SMTP server supports the EAI protocols, that is meaningless.  When
   one email service provider implements the EAI service, it can provide
   registration of EAI account.  The EAI user can exchange the email
   within the domain.  When another email service provider supports EAI
   protocols, the EAI users within these 2 domains can exchange the EAI
   message.  When the demands for internationalized email address
   increase, more and more email service providers will support EAI.
   Although it is not possible to support EAI protocol within one night,
   it is very possible that the EAI protocol will become more popular
   with the time being.  From non-EAI world to EAI world, it is
   procedure of step by step.

2.2.  Sending Server

   The sending server is used to send the message to the relay server or
   receiving server.  It should implement the specifications in the
   [RFC5335] and [RFC5336].  Since many relay servers and receiving
   servers are still not ready to accept EAI messages, it is very
   important to implement the mechnisms specified in the section 3.2 in
   [RFC5336].  The EAI messages can only be transferred to the EAI-
   capability server.  If alt-address is provided, it means that the
   email sender is trying to reach the receiver and the downgrading
   method spcified in the [RFC5504] may be used.  If the sending server
   has binded the EAI account to the ASCII one specified in the section
   3 of this document, the sending server should find the ASCII address
   corresponding to the EAI one and do some downgrading when
   encountering some non-EAI-capability server.  In other situations,
   the suggested methods either reject the message during the SMTP
   transaction or accept the message and then generate and transmit a
   notification of non-deliverability.

Internet-Draft          EAI Deployment Practices               June 2009


2.3.  Relay Server

   It is very possible that the relay server does not support EAI
   protocols.  If EAI server sends the message to the non-EAI-capability
   server, the EAI server should adopt one of the 4 methods specified in
   the section 3.2 in RFC 5336[RFC5336].  If the relay server is under
   the control of one organization which is in charge of both the
   sending servers and relay servers, it is suggested that this
   organizaiton should update all his servers to support EAI protocols
   to make smooth operation.

2.4.  Receiving Server

   If the reciving server does not support EAI protocols, it will be
   unlikely to accept the EAI message.  If the EAI-capability server
   receives the EAI message, the serve will distribute the message to
   the message store.

2.5.  MUA

   The EAI WG has clearly defined the protocol about how to exchange the
   message between two SMTP servers.  If you want to use the
   internationalized email address, it is very vitail that the other
   parts such as MUA (Mail User Agent) of the email system support EAI
   protocols.  Since most MUA do not support internationalized email
   address, MUA can not send the internationalized email address on
   behals of the email user and fetch the EAI message from the server.
   For the better use of EAI, MUA should be upgraded to support EAI
   protocols.

2.6.  Full Support of EAI Protocols

   The email system is very complex.  Many parts of the email system
   will use the email address.  It is suggested that all parts of the
   email system should be upgraded to support EAI protocols.


3.  Formation of the Alternate Address

   There are millions email servers and clients, which can not be
   updated to support EAI protocols within a night.  EAI protocols
   design a transitional method, which allows the eai-capability smtp
   server to talk with the non-eai-capability smtp servers.  During the
   deployment of EAI, it is impossible to make all of SMTP servers to
   upgrade to support EAI.  The SMTPext document [RFC5336] designs an
   alt-address parameter for use when downgrading is needed.  Only EAI
   user may want to use the alt-address.  ASCII user has no need to use
   the alt-address.  The current email protocol also prohibits the use

Internet-Draft          EAI Deployment Practices               June 2009


   of alt-address used by ASCII user.  The email service provider is
   suggested to build both the internationalized email domain and the
   ASCII email domain while creating the internationalized email domain.
   ASCII domain can be regarded as the alias of internationalized
   domain.  Both domains's MX record in DNS are resolved to the same MX
   record.  When the email user applys the internationalized email
   account, it is better that the system automatically binds it with an
   ASCII email account.  This email account's name may be selected by
   email account applicant.  This ASCII email address is regarded as the
   alt-address name; it can be an alias aacount of the EAI account.
   Both internationalized email address and ASCII email address refer to
   the same email store.  This method has an advantage: When the EAI
   user sending an email to other user using his own EAI account need
   not fill in his own alt-address when the receiver does not support
   EAI capability.  The EAI-capablity server who creats the
   internationalized email account will help to fill the ALt-address.


4.  Converting Local Character Codes To UTF-8 encoding

   Some systems, operating in local environments, will use local
   character codes no matter what we specify.  In many countries, there
   are local national standards for character encoding.  For example, in
   China, GB2312 and GB18000 is the national standards.  Japan has also
   its own national character encoding standards.  So there are some
   reasons for permitting local-parts to be written in locally-used
   character codes other than the UTF-8 encoding of UNICODE.  On the
   other hand, having an application presented with an octet (or bit)
   string and not knowing what charset is involved would block the
   attempt to intelligently display local parts.  The EAI protocol
   allows only UTF-8 encoding in the local part in the email header and
   envelop.  The MUA may display the message information with the local
   character codes.  But when the email address information is
   transferred on the wire, it must use the UTF-8 encoding other than
   local character encodings.  Use of local coding also implies an
   encoding for the local part different from that for the domain part.
   The domain part of the internationalized email address will support
   IDNA [RFC3490] and uses the UTF-8 encodings.  If local codings can be
   avoided entirely, it will considerably reduce complexity and
   "opportunities" for systems to not interoperate.


5.  Restrictions on Characters in Local Part

   The EAI specification is extremely liberal about what can be included
   in a UTF-8 string that represents a local-part.  It prohibits the use
   of quoted strings, or quoted characters, in non-ASCII local parts.
   Quoted strings and characters in local parts have, in general, been



Yao & Lee               Expires December 30, 2009               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft          EAI Deployment Practices               June 2009


   nothing but trouble and there appears to be no reason to carry that
   trouble forward into an internationalized world.  It is suggested
   that applying restrictions by use of a stringprep [RFC3454] profile
   that would eliminate particularly problematic characters is
   suggested.  IDNAbis label check may be used for local parts.  Some
   languages characters has some special features.  For example, Chinese
   characters has some varants.  When registering the email account, the
   technique specified in the RFC 3743 may be used for the possible
   confusion.  ASCII local-parts are inherently case sensitive.  The
   local systems are encouraged to not take advantage of that feature.
   All internationalized email local part are suggested to be case
   insensitive.


6.  Local part interpretations

   In the Internet email context, the interpretation and permitted
   syntax for an email local-part is entirely the responsibility of the
   receiving system.  The general advice to system designers still
   include "treat addresses in a case-independent fashion" and "do not
   use addresses that require quoting".  Senders should continue to be
   conservative about what they send, and relays should continue to
   avoid presumptions about their understanding of the content of local-
   parts.  Receiving systems that have reason to adopt more restricted
   syntax rules, or interpretations of matching, should continue to be
   able to do so.


7.  Lookup in DNS

   The domain part of the email address is used to route the message to
   the proper destination.  The domain part must be processed into the
   punycode form specified in RFC 3490 [RFC3490] before DNS lookup.


8.  Test Scenarios

   We have test some scenarios described in scenario documents
   [Secnarios].  Testing between EAI system with the same implementation
   (postfix)

   1.  Scenario 1:Two i18mail users
   2.  Scenario 2:Three i18mail users
   3.  Scenario 3:An i18mail user sends to one ascii user

   Testing between EAI systems with different implementations

   1.  Test with NIDA (own implementation with python )
   2.  Test with JPRS (own implementation with C )
   3.  Test with AFILIAS (implementation based on sendmail)
   4.  Test with TWNIC (implementation based on sendmail)


9.  Test Results and Experiences

9.1.  Test Results

   From these tests, we get the following results: The implementation
   based on the EAI protocol is workable.  We need more email service
   providers to implement and deploy EAI protocols.

9.2.  Firewall

   During the test, we find that some firewall will block the EAI
   message and cut off the SMTP connection.  It is suggested that the
   firwall should be updated to support EAI protocols too.

9.3.  Experiences

   During the test, we find that many users are interested in using the
   internationaliezed email address.  They prefer more email service
   providers to provide such services.  During the implementation,
   different implementer may encounter different problems.  If the
   implementers try to analysed the EAI protocols and the base protcols
   of RFC 2821 and RFC 2822 throughtly, it is still easy to implement
   it.  Since many implementers have implemented EAI protocols based on
   different email source code such as Postfix and Sendmail and done a
   lot of inter-operating, it has already proved that the EAI protocols
   can be implemented and workable.


10.  IANA Considerations

   There is no IANA consideraton.


11.  Security Considerations

   See the extended security considerations discussion in the framework
   document [RFC4952].

   Klensin has done a lot of reasearch on ASCII email address and
   internationalized email address.  I got many significant words or
   ideas from him.  Many friends and experts in the EAI WG help us to
   produce the valuable ideas.  Many organizations including
   CNNICGBP[not]TWNIC, JPRS, NIDA, AND AFFLILIAS have implemented EAI
   systems.  These organizations have already done a lot of inter-
   operating testing.
