Abstract  
     
   The PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access)  
   working group is developing protocol for authenticating clients to  
   the access network using IP based protocols.  The PANA protocol  
   authenticates the client and also establishes a PANA security  
   association between the PANA client and PANA authentication agent at  
   the end of a successful authentication. This document discusses the  
   details for establishing an IPsec security association using the PANA  
   security association for enabling IPsec based access control.

1.0 Introduction  
     
   The PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access)  
   working group is developing protocol for authenticating clients to  
   the access network using IP based protocols.  The PANA protocol  
   authenticates the client and also establishes a PANA security  
   association between the PANA client and PANA authentication agent at  
   the end of successful authentication. The PANA authentication agent  
   (PAA) indicates the results of the authentication using the PANA- 
   Bind-Request message wherein it can indicate the access control  
   method enforced by the access network. The PANA protocol [PANA-PROT]  
   does not discuss any details of IPsec [IPSEC] SA establishment, when  
   IPsec is used for access control. This document discusses the details  
   of establishing an IPsec security association between PANA client and  
   the enforcement point. When the IPsec SA is successfully established,  
   it can be used for access control and specifically used to prevent  
   the service theft mentioned in [PANA-THREATS].  
     
   Please refer to [PANAREQ] for terminology and definitions of terms  
   used in this document. The following picture illustrates what is  
   being protected with IPsec. As shown in Figure 1, Enforcement Point  
   (EP) and the Access Router (AR) are co-located. PAA is not shown in  
   the figure. It may or may not be co-located with EP. The IPsec  
   security association protects the traffic between PaC and EP. In  
   IPsec terms, EP is a security gateway (therefore a router) and  
   forwards packets coming from the PaC to other nodes.

   First, this document discusses some of the pre-requisites for IPsec  
   SA establishment. Next, it gives details on what should be  
   communicated between PAA and EP. Then, it gives the details of  
   IKE/IPsec exchange with packet formats and SPD entries. Finally, it  
   discusses the issues when IPsec is used for remote access together  
   with local access.

3.0 Pre-requisites for IPsec SA establisment  
  
   This document assumes that the following have already happened before  
   the IKE exchange starts.  
     
     1) PANA client (PaC) and PAA mutually authenticate each other using  
        EAP methods that derive AAA-key [EAP-KEY].  
       
     2) PaC learns the IP address of the Enforcement point (EP) during  
        the PANA exchange.  
     
     3) PaC learns that the network uses IPsec [IPSEC] for securing the  
        link between PaC and EP during the PANA exchange.  
  
     4) PaC configures a routable or global address as discussed in  
        section 4 of this document.  
  
4.0 IP Address Configuration  
  
  
  
<Parthasarathy>          Expires August 2004                 [Page 3]  
  
               PANA enabling IPsec based Access Control  February 2004  
  
   PaC configures a link-local address [IPV4-LINK] [IPV6-CONF] before  
   the PANA protocol begins. If IPv4 is being used, it may even  
   configure a private address [IPV4-PRIV] using a DHCP server provided  
   by the Network Access provider. See [PANA-FRAME] for more details.  
   After a successful authentication, the client configures a routable  
   or global address using [DHCP][DHCPV6] before running [IKE][IKEv2] or  
   running address auto-configuration methods available within [IKE] or  
   [IKEv2] by using a configuration payload or running DHCP over a  
   special IPsec tunnel mode SA [RFC3456] or auto-configures an address  
   using stateless auto-configuration [IPv6-ND] before running [IKE] or  
   [IKEv2] if IPv6 is being used.  
     
   In the case of IPV4, the link-local address or private address SHOULD  
   be un-configured when the global address is configured, to prevent  
   using the link-local address or private address as the source address  
   for communicating with the external nodes [IPV4-LINK]. Some  
   implementations may be able to choose the right address, where the  
   IPsec tunnel mode SAs are modeled as interfaces. But this document  
   does not make any such assumptions. In IPv4, all packets are tunneled  
   using IPsec tunnel mode SA with the inner and outer source address  
   same as the routable address. In the case of IPv6, such restrictions  
   don't exist. The link-local address is used for the outer header and  
   global address is used for the inner header for the tunnel.  
  
5.0 IKE Pre-shared key derivation  
     
   If the network chooses IPsec to secure the link between PaC and EP,  
   PAA should communicate the IKE pre-shared key, the link-local address  
   of the PaC (in IPv6 only), routable address of the PaC and the PANA  
   session ID to EP before the IKE exchange begins.   
     
   The IKE exchange between PaC and PAA is equivalent to the 4-way  
   handshake in [IEEE80211i] following the EAP exchange. The IKE  
   exchange establishes the IPsec SA similar to the pair-wise transient  
   keys (PTK) established in [IEEE80211i]. The IKE exchange provides  
   both key confirmation and protected cipher-suite negotiation.  
     
   IKE pre-shared key is derived as follows.  
     
   IKE Pre-shared Key = HMAC-SHA-1 (AAA-key, "IKE-preshared key" |  
                           Session ID | Key-ID | EP-address)  
     
   The values have the following meaning:    
     
   AAA-key: A key derived by the peer and EAP server and transported to  
   the authenticator [EAP-KEY].  
     
   Session ID: The value as defined in the PANA protocol [PANA-PROT],  
   identifies a particular session of a client.  
  
  
<Parthasarathy>          Expires August 2004                 [Page 4]  
  
               PANA enabling IPsec based Access Control  February 2004  
  
     
   Key-ID: This identifies the AAA-key within a given session [PANA- 
   PROT]. During the lifetime of the PANA session, there could be  
   multiple EAP re-authentications. As EAP re-authentication changes the  
   AAA-key, key-ID is used to identify the right AAA-key.  
     
   EP-address: This is the address of the enforcement point with which  
   the IKE exchange is being performed. When PAA is controlling multiple  
   EPs, this provides a different pre-shared key for each of the EPs.  
     
   The character "|" denotes concatenation as defined in [IKE].  
     
   During EAP re-authentication, the AAA-key changes. Whenever the AAA- 
   key changes, a new value of Key-ID is established between the PaC and  
   PAA/EP as defined in [PANA-PROT]. If there is already an IKE SA or  
   IPsec SA established, it MUST continue to be used till it expires. A  
   change in the value of AAA-key MUST NOT result in re-negotiating a  
   new IKE SA or IPsec SA immediately. But any new negotiation of IKE SA  
   or IPsec SA MUST use the new pre-shared key derived from the latest  
   AAA-key and is indicated by the Key-ID in the above equation.  
     
  
6.0 IKE and IPsec details  
     
   IKE [IKE] MUST be used for establishing the IPsec SA. The details  
   specified in this document would work with IKEv2 [IKEV2] also. Any  
   difference between them would be explicitly noted. PANA authenticates  
   the client and derives the keys to protect the traffic. Hence, manual  
   keying cannot be used. Aggressive mode with pre-shared key MUST be  
   supported. PaC and EP SHOULD use its PANA session ID [PANA-PROT] as  
   the payload of ID_KEY_ID in aggressive mode for establishing the  
   phase I SA. IP addresses cannot be used as identifier as the PaC may  
   be re-authenticated multiple times and hence may not uniquely  
   identify the pre-shared key. For the same reason, main mode of IKE  
   cannot be used as it requires addresses to be used as identifiers.  
     
   After Phase I SA is established, quick mode exchange is performed to  
   establish an ESP tunnel mode IPsec SA for protecting the traffic  
   between PaC and EP. The identities used during Phase II are explained  
   in the next section.    
     
   As mentioned in section 4, there are multiple ways by which the PaC  
   may configure the address before the IKE exchange starts. Most of the  
   IKE implementations assume that they can consult the SPD during the  
   IKE exchange for policy checks. In the case of address configuration  
   using [RFC3456] or [IKE] [IKEV2] or [DHCP] [DHCPV6], EP can learn the  
   address allocated to the client and hence setup the SPD before the  
   IKE exchange starts. In the case of auto-configuration (which  
   includes global address or addresses configured as in [PRIV]), EP may

               PANA enabling IPsec based Access Control  February 2004  
  
   not know the address assigned to the PaC. Thus, it may not be able to  
   setup the SPD entries appropriately before IKE exchange starts. As  
   most of the IKE implementations assume that the SPD can be consulted  
   during the SA negotiation, it may require slightly a different  
   behavior from IKE in the auto-configuration case. In the case of  
   auto-configuration, IKE should be able to setup the SAs for the  
   traffic selectors (which contains the PaC auto-configured address)  
   specified by the PaC without requiring a corresponding entry in the  
   SPD. If there is already an SA for the same address used by a  
   different session as specified in the ID_KEY_ID payload, then the SA  
   request MUST be rejected with INVALID-ID-INFORMATION [IKE]. If PaC  
   establishes the IKE and IPsec SA successfully, EP should add the SPD  
   entry for protecting the subsequent data packets.  
  
7.0 Packet Formats  
  
   Following acronyms are used throughout this document.  
  
   PaC's link-local address is denoted by PAC-LINK-LOCAL.  
     
   PaC's routable or global address is denoted by PAC-GLOBAL-ADDR.  
     
   EP's link-local address is denoted by EP-LINK-LOCAL.  
     
   The node with which the PaC is communicating is denoted by END-ADDR.  
     
   In IPv4, the global address is used as both inner and outer source  
   address of the tunneled packet. In IPv6, the link-local address is  
   used as the outer header and the global address is used as the inner  
   header of the tunneled packet.  
  
   Following is the IPv4 packet format on the wire for packets sent from  
   PaC to EP:  
     
         IPv4 header      (source = PAC-GLOBAL-ADDR,  
                           destination = EP-LINK-LOCAL)  
         ESP  header  
         IPv4 header      (source = PAC-GLOBAL-ADDR,  
                           destination = END-ADDR)  
     
   Following is the IPv6 packet format on the wire for packets sent from  
   PaC to EP:  
     
         IPv6 header      (source = PAC-LINK-LOCAL,  
                           destination = EP-LINK-LOCAL)  
         ESP  header  
         IPv6 header      (source = PAC-GLOBAL-ADDR,  
                           destination = END-ADDR)

   Following is the IPv4 packet format on the wire for packets sent from  
   EP to PaC:  
  
         IPv4 header      (source = EP-LINK-LOCAL,  
                           destination = PAC-GLOBAL-ADDR)  
         ESP  header  
         IPv4 header      (source = END-ADDR,  
                           destination = PAC-GLOBAL-ADDR)  
     
   Following is the IPv6 packet format on the wire for packets sent from  
   EP to PaC:  
  
         IPv6 header      (source = EP-LINK-LOCAL,  
                           destination = PAC-LINK-LOCAL)  
         ESP  header  
         IPv6 header      (source = END-ADDR,  
                           destination = PAC-GLOBAL-ADDR)  
     
8.0 IPsec SPD entries  
     
   The SPD entries for IPv4 and IPv6 are specified separately as they  
   are different.  
  
8.1 IPv4 SPD entries  
  
   PaC's SPD OUT:  
             IF source = PAC-GLOBAL-ADDR & destination = any  
              THEN USE ESP TUNNEL MODE SA:  
              outer source = PAC-GLOBAL-ADDR  
              outer destination = EP-LINK-LOCAL

            IF source = any & destination = PAC-GLOBAL-ADDR  
             THEN USE ESP TUNEL MODE SA:  
             outer source = EP-LINK-LOCAL  
             outer destination = PAC-GLOBAL-ADDR

            IF source = PAC-GLOBAL-ADDR & destination = any  
             THEN USE ESP TUNNEL MODE SA:

              outer destination = EP-LINK-LOCAL

               PANA enabling IPsec based Access Control  February 2004  
  
   During the IPsec SA setup, PaC uses PAC-GLOBAL-ADDR as its phase 2  
   identity (IDci) and EP uses ID_IPV4_ADDR_RANGE or ID_IPV4_ADDR_SUBNET  
   as its phase 2 identity. The starting address is zero IP address and  
   the end address is all ones for ID_IPV4_ADDR_RANGE. The starting  
   address is zero IP address and the end address is all zeroes for  
   ID_IPV4_ADDR_SUBNET.  
     
8.2 IPv6 SPD entries  
     
   The IPv6 SPD entries are slightly different from IPv4 to prevent the  
   neighbor and router discovery [IPV6-ND] packets from being protected  
   with IPsec. The first three entries of the following SPD tables  
   bypass IPsec protection for neighbor and router discovery packets.  
   The latest version of the IPsec [IPSEC-BIS] document allows traffic  
   selectors to be based on ICMPv6 type and code values. In that case,  
   the first three entries can be based on ICMPv6 type and code values.  
      
   All traffic destined to global address is always sent to the default  
   router (EP) i.e, the global prefix is not considered to be on-link.  
   This can be achieved by turning off the "L" bit in the router  
   advertisement.

   During the IPsec SA setup, PaC uses PAC-GLOBAL-ADDR as its phase 2  
   identity (IDci) and EP uses ID_IPV6_ADDR_RANGE or ID_IPV6_ADDR_SUBNET  
   as its phase 2 identity. The starting address is zero IP address and  
   the end address is all ones for ID_IPV6_ADDR_RANGE. The starting  
   address is zero IP address and the end address is all zeroes for  
   ID_IPV6_ADDR_SUBNET.  
     
9.0 Double IPsec

   If the PaC uses IPsec for secure remote access e.g., Corporate VPN  
   access, there will be separate SPD entries protecting the traffic to  
   or from the remote network. In this case, IPsec may need to be  
   applied twice, once for protecting the remote access and once for  
   protecting the local access. This is the same as the iterative  
   tunneling discussed in [IPSEC].  
     
   When the IPsec SA is established with the remote security gateway,  
   the IKE packets from the PaC to the remote security gateway may or  
   may not need IPsec protection on the local link depending on the  
   configuration at the EP. If EP requires IPsec protection for all  
   packets, then the PaC should configure SPD entries appropriately so  
   that IKE packets destined to EP are bypassed whereas IKE packets to  
   the remote SG are protected. If EP does not require IPsec protection  
   for IKE packets destined to remote security gateway, it needs to  
   configure SPD entries that would bypass them.  
  
  
10.0 Security considerations  
     
   This document discusses the use of IPsec for access control when PANA  
   is used for authenticating the clients to the access network.  
     
   If the PAA does not verify whether PaC is authorized to use an IP  
   address, it is possible for the PaC to steal the traffic destined to  
   some other PaC. Although section 6 describes an inner address  
   verification method based on SPD consulting, it is still possible for  
   an authenticated PaC to launch this attack. PAA may use other  
   mechanisms to prevent this attack [SEND].  
     
   When IPv6 is used, the SPD entries bypass all link-local traffic  
   without applying IPsec. This should not be a limitation as the link- 
   local address is used only by link-local services e.g.  
   neighbor/router discovery, which uses a different mechanism to  
   protect their traffic. Moreover, this limitation may not be there in  
   the future if IPsec extends the SPD selectors to specify ICMP types.
