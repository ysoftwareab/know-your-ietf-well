        OSPF LLS Extensions for Local Interface ID Advertisement
                  draft-ietf-ospf-lls-interface-id-09

Abstract

   Every OSPF interface is assigned an identifier, Interface ID, which
   uniquely identifies the interface on the router.  In some cases it is
   useful to know the assigned Interface ID on the remote side of the
   adjacency (Remote Interface ID).

   This draft describes the extensions to OSPF link-local signalling
   (LLS) to advertise the Local Interface Identifier.

1.  Introduction

   Every OSPF interface is assigned an Interface ID, which uniquely
   identifies the interface on the router.  [RFC2328] uses this
   Interface ID in the Router-LSA Link Data for unnumbered links and
   uses the value of the MIB-II IfIndex [RFC2863].  [RFC4203] refers to
   these Interface IDs as the Link Local/Remote Identifiers and defines
   a way to advertise and use them for Generalized Multi-Protocol Label
   Switching (GMPLS) purposes.  [RFC7684] defines a way to advertise
   Local/Remote Interface IDs in the OSPFv2 Extended Link LSA.

   There is a known OSPFv2 protocol problem in verifying the bi-
   directional connectivity with parallel unnumbered links.  If there
   are two parallel unnumbered links between a pair of routers and each
   link is only advertised from single direction, such two
   unidirectional parallel links could be considered as a valid single
   bidirectional link during the OSPF route computation on some other
   router.  If each link is advertised with both its Local and Remote

   Interface IDs, the advertisement of each link from both sides of
   adjacency can be verified by cross-checking the Local and Remote
   Interface IDs of both advertisements.

   From the perspective of the advertising router, the Local Interface
   Identifier is a known value, however the Remote Interface Identifier
   needs to be learnt before it can be advertised.  [RFC4203] suggests
   to use TE Link Local LSA [RFC3630] to communicate the Local Interface
   Identifier to neighbors on the link.  Though such mechanism works, it
   has some drawbacks.

   This draft proposes an extension to OSPF link-local signalling (LLS)
   [RFC5613] to advertise the Local Interface Identifier.

1.1.  Interface ID Exchange using TE Opaque LSA

   Usage of the Link Local TE Opaque LSA to propagate the Local
   Interface Identifier to the neighbors on the link is described in
   [RFC4203].  This mechanism has the following problems:

      LSAs can only be flooded over an existing adjacency that is in
      Exchange state or greater.  The adjacency state machine progresses
      independently on each side of the adjacency and, as such, may
      reach the Full state on one side before the TE Link Opaque LSA
      arrives.  The consequence is that link can be initially advertised
      without the Remote Interface Identifier.  Later, when the TE Link
      Opaque LSA arrives, the link must be advertised again, this time
      with the valid Remote Interface Identifier.  Implementations may
      choose to wait before advertising the link, but there is no
      guarantee that the neighbor will ever advertise the TE Link Opaque
      LSA with the Interface Identifier.  In summary, the existing
      mechanism does not guarantee that the Remote Interface Identifier
      is known at the time the link is advertised.

      The TE Opaque LSA is defined for MPLS Traffic Engineering, but the
      knowledge of the Remote Interface Identifier is useful also for
      cases where MPLS TE is not used.  One example is the mentioned
      lack of a valid 2-way connectivity check for parallel point-to-
      point links between OSPF routers.

2.  Interface ID Exchange using OSPF LLS

   To address the problems described earlier and to allow the Interface
   Identifier exchange to be part of the neighbor discovery process, we
   propose to extend OSPF link-local signalling to advertise the Local
   Interface Identifier in OSPF Hello and Database Description (DD)
   packets.

2.1.  Local Interface Identifier TLV

   The Local Interface Identifier TLV is a LLS TLV.  It has following
   format:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |              Type             |             Length            |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                   Local Interface Identifier                  |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   where:

      Type: TBD

      Length: 4 octets

      Local Interface Identifier: The value of the local Interface
      Identifier.

   Local Interface Identifier TLV signalling using LLS is applicable to
   all OSPF interface types other than virtual links.

3.  Backward Compatibility with RFC 4203

   If the Local Interface ID signaling via Link Local TE Opaque LSA is
   supported in addition to the new LLS mechanism, implementations which
   support Local Interface ID signalling using LLS MUST prefer the Local
   Interface ID value received through LLS over the value received
   through the Link Local TE Opaque LSA if both are received from the
   same OSPF router.

   Implementations which support Local Interface ID signalling via Link
   Local TE Opaque LSA MAY continue to do so to ensure backward
   compatibility.  If they also support Local Interface ID signalling
   using LLS as described herein, they MUST signal the same Local
   Interface ID via both mechanisms.

   During the rare conditions, when the Local Interface ID changes, a
   timing interval may exist, where the received values of the Local
   Interface ID advertised through LLS and Link Local TE Opaque LSA may
   differ.  Such situation is temporary and received values via both
   mechanisms should become equal as soon as the next Hello and/or Link
   Local TE Opaque LSA is re-generated by the originator.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This specification allocates a single code point from the "Open
   Shortest Path First (OSPF) Link Local Signalling (LLS) - Type/Length/
   Value Identifiers (TLV)" registry.

   Following value is allocated:

   o TBD - Local Interface Identifier TLV

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for "OSPF Link-Local Signaling" [RFC5613]
   also apply to the Local Interface Identifier TLV described herein.
   The current usage of a neighbor's Local Interface Identifier is to
   disambiguate parallel links between OSPF routers.  Hence,
   modification of the advertised Local Interface Identifier TLV may
   result in the wrong neighbor interface identifier being advertised in
   the OSPFv2 Extended Link LSA [RFC7684] and could prevent the link
   from being used.  If authentication is being used in the OSPF routing
   domain [RFC5709], then the Cryptographic Authentication TLV [RFC5613]
   SHOULD also be used to protect that contents of the Link-Local
   Signaling (LLS) block.

   Receiving a malformed LLS Interface Identifier TLV MUST NOT result in
   a hard router or OSPF process failure.  The reception of malformed
   LLS TLVs or Sub-TLVs SHOULD be logged but such logging MUST be rate-
   limited to prevent Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.

   The interface ID is assigned by the advertising OSPF router as a
   locally unique identifier and need not be unique in any broader
   context; it is not expected to contain any information about the
   device owner or traffic transiting the device, so there are no
   privacy oncerns associated with its advertisement.
