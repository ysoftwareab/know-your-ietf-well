1.  Introduction

   This document defines a data model for Network Address Translation
   (NAT) and Network Prefix Translation (NPT) capabilities using the
   YANG data modeling language [RFC7950].

   Traditional NAT is defined in [RFC2663], while Carrier Grade NAT
   (CGN) is defined in [RFC6888].  Unlike traditional NAT, the CGN is
   used to optimize the usage of global IP address space at the scale of
   a domain: a CGN is not managed by end users, but by service providers
   instead.  This document covers both traditional NATs and CGNs.

   This document also covers NAT64 [RFC6146], customer-side translator
   (CLAT) [RFC6877], Stateless IP/ICMP Translation (SIIT) [RFC7915],
   Explicit Address Mappings for Stateless IP/ICMP Translation (EAM)
   [RFC7757], IPv6 Network Prefix Translation (NPTv6) [RFC6296], and
   Destination NAT.  The full set of translation schemes that are in
   scope is included in Section 2.2.

   Sample examples are provided in Appendix A.  These examples are not
   intended to be exhaustive.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   o  Basic Network Address Translation from IPv4 to IPv4 (NAT44):
      translation is limited to IP addresses alone (Section 2.1 of
      [RFC3022]).

Internet-Draft             YANG Module for NAT            September 2018


   o  Network Address/Port Translator (NAPT): translation in NAPT is
      extended to include IP addresses and transport identifiers (such
      as a TCP/UDP port or ICMP query ID); refer to Section 2.2 of
      [RFC3022].  A NAPT may use an extra identifier, in addition to the
      five transport tuple, to disambiguate bindings [RFC6619].

   o  Destination NAT: is a translation that acts on the destination IP
      address and/or destination port number.  This flavor is usually
      deployed in load balancers or at devices in front of public
      servers.

   o  Port-restricted IPv4 address: An IPv4 address with a restricted
      port set.  Multiple hosts may share the same IPv4 address;
      however, their port sets must not overlap [RFC7596].

   o  Restricted port set: A non-overlapping range of allowed external
      ports to use for NAT operation.  Source ports of IPv4 packets
      translated by a NAT must belong to the assigned port set.  The
      port set is used for all port-aware IP protocols [RFC7596].

   o  Internal Host: A host that may need to use a translation
      capability to send to and receive traffic from the Internet.

   o  Internal Address/prefix: The IP address/prefix of an internal
      host.

   o  External Address: The IP address/prefix assigned by a translator
      to an internal host; this is the address that will be seen by a
      remote host on the Internet.

   o  Mapping: denotes a state at the translator that is necessary for
      network address and/or port translation.

   o  Dynamic implicit mapping: is created implicitly as a side effect
      of processing a packet (e.g., an initial TCP SYN packet) that
      requires a new mapping.  A validity lifetime is associated with
      this mapping.

   o  Dynamic explicit mapping: is created as a result of an explicit
      request, e.g., PCP message [RFC6887].  A validity lifetime is
      associated with this mapping.

   o  Static explicit mapping: is created using, e.g., a CLI interface.
      This mapping is likely to be maintained by the NAT function till
      an explicit action is executed to remove it.

   The usage of the term NAT in this document refers to any translation
   flavor (NAT44, NAT64, etc.) indifferently.

Internet-Draft             YANG Module for NAT            September 2018


   This document uses the term "session" as defined in [RFC2663] and
   [RFC6146] for NAT64.

   This document follows the guidelines of [RFC6087], uses the common
   YANG types defined in [RFC6991], and adopts the Network Management
   Datastore Architecture (NMDA).  The meaning of the symbols in tree
   diagrams is defined in [RFC8340].

2.  Overview of the NAT YANG Data Model

2.1.  Overview

   The NAT YANG module is designed to cover dynamic implicit mappings
   and static explicit mappings.  The required functionality to instruct
   dynamic explicit mappings is defined in separate documents such as
   [I-D.boucadair-pcp-yang].  Considerations about instructing by
   explicit dynamic means (e.g., [RFC6887], [RFC6736], or [RFC8045]) are
   out of scope.  As a reminder, REQ-9 of [RFC6888] requires that a CGN
   must implement a protocol giving subscribers explicit control over
   NAT mappings; that protocol should be the Port Control Protocol
   [RFC6887].

   A single NAT device can have multiple NAT instances; each of these
   instances can be provided with its own policies (e.g., be responsible
   for serving a group of hosts).  This document does not make any
   assumption about how internal hosts or flows are associated with a
   given NAT instance.

   The NAT YANG module assumes that each NAT instance can be enabled/
   disabled, be provisioned with a specific set of configuration data,
   and maintains its own mapping tables.

   The NAT YANG module allows for a NAT instance to be provided with
   multiple NAT policies (/nat/instances/instance/policy).  The document
   does not make any assumption about how flows are associated with a
   given NAT policy of a given NAT instance.  Classification filters are
   out of scope.

   Defining multiple NAT instances or configuring multiple NAT policies
   within one single NAT instance is implementation- and deployment-
   specific.

   This YANG module does not provide any method to instruct a NAT
   function to enable the logging feature or to specify the information
   to be logged for administrative or regulatory reasons (Section 2.3 of
   [RFC6908] and REQ-12 of [RFC6888]).  Those considerations are out of
   the scope of this document.

2.2.  Various Translation Flavors

   The following translation modes are supported:

   o  Basic NAT44
   o  NAPT
   o  Destination NAT
   o  Port-restricted NAT
   o  Stateful NAT64 (including with destination-based Pref64::/n
      [RFC7050])
   o  SIIT
   o  CLAT
   o  EAM
   o  NPTv6
   o  Combination of Basic NAT/NAPT and Destination NAT
   o  Combination of port-restricted and Destination NAT
   o  Combination of NAT64 and EAM
   o  Stateful and Stateless NAT64

   [I-D.ietf-softwire-dslite-yang] specifies an extension to the NAT
   YANG module to support DS-Lite.

   The YANG "feature" statement is used to indicate which of the
   different translation modes is relevant for a specific data node.
   Table 1 lists defined features:

            +---------------------------------+--------------+
            |                Translation Mode | YANG Feature |
            +---------------------------------+--------------+
            |                     Basic NAT44 | basic-nat44  |
            |                            NAPT | napt44       |
            |                 Destination NAT | dst-nat      |
            |                  Stateful NAT64 | nat64        |
            | Stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation | siit         |
            |                            CLAT | clat         |
            |                             EAM | eam          |
            |                           NPTv6 | nptv6        |
            +---------------------------------+--------------+

                        Table 1: YANG NAT Features

   The following translation modes do not require defining dedicated
   features:

   o  Port-restricted NAT: This mode corresponds to supplying port
      restriction policies to a NAPT or NAT64 (port-set-restrict).
   o  Combination of Basic NAT/NAPT and Destination NAT: This mode
      corresponds to setting 'dst-nat-enable' for Basic NAT44 or NAPT.

Internet-Draft             YANG Module for NAT            September 2018


   o  Combination of port-restricted and Destination NAT: This mode can
      be achieved by configuring a NAPT with port restriction policies
      (port-set-restrict) together with a destination IP address pool
      (dst-ip-address-pool).
   o  Combination of NAT64 and EAM: This mode corresponds to configuring
      static mappings for NAT64.
   o  Stateful and stateless NAT64: A NAT64 implementation can be
      instructed to behave in the stateless mode for a given prefix by
      setting the parameter (nat64-prefixes/stateless-enable).  A NAT64
      implementation may behave in both stateful and stateless modes if,
      in addition to appropriately setting the parameter (nat64-
      prefixes/stateless-enable), an external IPv4 address pool is
      configured.

   The NAT YANG module provides a method to retrieve the capabilities of
   a NAT instance (including, list of supported translation modes, list
   of supported protocols, port restriction support status, supported
   NAT mapping types, supported NAT filtering types, port range
   allocation support status, port parity preservation support status,
   port preservation support status, the behavior for handling fragments
   (all, out-of-order, in-order)).

2.3.  TCP/UDP/ICMP NAT Behavioral Requirements

   This document assumes NAT behavioral recommendations for UDP
   [RFC4787], TCP [RFC5382], and ICMP [RFC5508] are enabled by default.

   Furthermore, the NAT YANG module relies upon the recommendations
   detailed in [RFC6888] and [RFC7857].

2.4.  Other Transport Protocols

   The module is structured to support protocols other than UDP, TCP,
   and ICMP.  Concretely, the module allows the operator to enable
   translation for other transport protocols when required
   (/nat/instances/instance/policy/transport-protocols).  Moreover, the
   mapping table is designed so that it can indicate any transport
   protocol.  For example, this module may be used to manage a DCCP-
   capable NAT that adheres to [RFC5597].

   Future extensions may be needed to cover NAT-related considerations
   that are specific to other transport protocols such as SCTP
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-natsupp].  Typically, the mapping entry can be
   extended to record two optional SCTP-specific parameters: Internal
   Verification Tag (Int-VTag) and External Verification Tag (Ext-VTag).

   This document only specifies transport protocol specific timers for
   UDP, TCP, and ICMP.  While some timers could potentially be

Internet-Draft             YANG Module for NAT            September 2018


   generalized for other connection-oriented protocols, this document
   does not follow such an approach because there is no standard
   document specifying such generic behavior.  Future documents may be
   edited to clarify how to reuse TCP-specific timers when needed.

2.5.  IP Addresses Used for Translation

   The NAT YANG module assumes that blocks of IP external addresses
   (external-ip-address-pool) can be provisioned to the NAT function.
   These blocks may be contiguous or not.

   This behavior is aligned with [RFC6888] which specifies that a NAT
   function should not have any limitations on the size or the
   contiguity of the external address pool.  In particular, the NAT
   function must be configurable with contiguous or non-contiguous
   external IPv4 address ranges.  To accommodate traditional NAT, the
   module allows for a single IP address to be configured for external-
   ip-address-pool.

   Likewise, one or multiple IP address pools may be configured for
   Destination NAT (dst-ip-address-pool).

2.6.  Port Set Assignment

   Port numbers can be assigned by a NAT individually (that is, a single
   port is assigned on a per session basis), but this port allocation
   scheme may not be optimal for logging purposes (Section 12 of
   [RFC6269]).  A NAT function should be able to assign port sets (e.g.,
   [RFC7753]) to optimize the volume of the logging data (REQ-14 of
   [RFC6888]).  Both allocation schemes are supported in the NAT YANG
   module.

   When port set assignment is activated (i.e., port-allocation-
   type==port-range-allocation), the NAT can be provided with the size
   of the port set to be assigned (port-set-size).

2.7.  Port-Restricted IP Addresses

   Some NATs restrict the source port numbers (e.g., Lightweight 4over6
   [RFC7596], MAP-E [RFC7597]).  Two schemes of port set assignments
   (port-set-restrict) are supported in this document:

   o  Simple port range: is defined by two port values, the start and
      the end of the port range [RFC8045].

   o  Algorithmic: an algorithm is defined in [RFC7597] to characterize
      the set of ports that can be used.

2.8.  NAT Mapping Entries

   A TCP/UDP mapping entry maintains an association between the
   following information:

      (internal-src-address, internal-src-port) (internal-dst-address,
      internal-dst-port) <=> (external-src-address, external-src-port)
      (external-dst-address, external-dst-port)

   An ICMP mapping entry maintains an association between the following
   information:

      (internal-src-address, internal-dst-address, internal ICMP/ICMPv6
      identifier) <=> (external-src-address, external-dst-address,
      external ICMP/ICMPv6 identifier)

   As a reminder, all the ICMP Query messages contain an 'Identifier'
   field, which is referred to in this document as the 'ICMP
   Identifier'.

   To cover TCP, UDP, and ICMP, the NAT YANG module assumes the
   following structure of a mapping entry:

   type:   Indicates how the mapping was instantiated.  For example, it
      may indicate whether a mapping is dynamically instantiated by a
      packet or statically configured.

   transport-protocol:  Indicates the transport protocol (e.g., UDP,
      TCP, ICMP) of a given mapping.

   internal-src-address:  Indicates the source IP address/prefix as used
      by an internal host.

   internal-src-port:  Indicates the source port number (or ICMP
      identifier) as used by an internal host.

   external-src-address:   Indicates the source IP address/prefix as
      assigned by the NAT.

   external-src-port:   Indicates the source port number (or ICMP
      identifier) as assigned by the NAT.

   internal-dst-address:  Indicates the destination IP address/prefix as
      used by an internal host when sending a packet to a remote host.

   internal-dst-port:   Indicates the destination port number as used by
      an internal host when sending a packet to a remote host.

Internet-Draft             YANG Module for NAT            September 2018


   external-dst-address:  Indicates the destination IP address/prefix
      used by a NAT when processing a packet issued by an internal host
      towards a remote host.

   external-dst-port:   Indicates the destination port number used by a
      NAT when processing a packet issued by an internal host towards a
      remote host.

   In order to cover both NAT64 and NAT44 flavors, the NAT mapping
   structure allows for the inclusion of an IPv4 or an IPv6 address as

   schemes.

   For example, the mapping that will be created by a NAT64 upon receipt
   of a TCP SYN from source address 2001:db8:aaaa::1 and source port
   number 25636 to destination IP address 2001:db8:1234::198.51.100.1
   and destination port number 8080 is shown in Table 2.  This example

              Table 4: Example of an EIM NAT64 Mapping Entry

   Note that a mapping table is maintained only for stateful NAT
   functions.  Particularly:

   o  No mapping table is maintained for NPTv6 given that it is
      stateless and transport-agnostic.

   o  The double translations are stateless in CLAT if a dedicated IPv6
      prefix is provided for CLAT.  If not, a stateful NAT44 will be
      required.

   o  No per-flow mapping is maintained for EAM [RFC7757].

Internet-Draft             YANG Module for NAT            September 2018


   o  No mapping table is maintained for Stateless IPv4/IPv6
      translation.  As a reminder, in such deployments internal IPv6
      nodes are addressed using IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses, which
      enable them to be accessed by IPv4 nodes [RFC6052].

2.9.  Resource Limits

   In order to comply with CGN deployments in particular, the NAT YANG
   module allows limiting the number of external ports per subscriber
   (port-quota) and the amount of state memory allocated per mapping and
   per subscriber (mapping-limits and connection-limits).  According to
   [RFC6888], the module is designed to allow for the following:

   o  Per-subscriber limits are configurable by the NAT administrator.

   o  Per-subscriber limits are configurable independently per transport
      protocol.

   o  Administrator-adjustable thresholds to prevent a single subscriber
      from consuming excessive CPU resources from the NAT (e.g., rate-
      limit the subscriber's creation of new mappings) can be
      configured.

   Table 5 lists the various limits that can be set using the NAT YANG
   module.  Once a limit is reached, packets that would normally trigger
   new port mappings or be translated because they match existing
   mappings, are dropped by the translator.

2.10.  Binding the NAT Function to an External Interface

   The module is designed to specify an external realm on which the NAT
   function must be applied (external-realm).  The module supports
   indicating an interface as an external realm [RFC8343], but the
   module is extensible so that other choices can be indicated in the
   future (e.g., Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) instance).

   Distinct external realms can be provided as a function of the NAT
   policy (see for example, Section 4 of [RFC7289]).

   If no external realm is provided, this assumes that the system is
   able to determine the external interface (VRF instance, etc.) on
   which the NAT will be applied.  Typically, the WAN and LAN interfaces
   of a CPE are determined by the CPE.

2.11.  Relationship to NATV2-MIB

   Section of 5.1 of [RFC7659] indicates that the NATV2-MIB assumes that
   the following information is configured on the NAT by some means, not
   specified in [RFC7659]:

   o  The set of address realms to which the device connect.

   o  For the CGN case, per-subscriber information including subscriber
      index, address realm, assigned prefix or address, and (possibly)
      policies regarding address pool selection in the various possible
      address realms to which the subscriber may connect.

   o  The set of NAT instances running on the device, identified by NAT
      instance index and name.

Internet-Draft             YANG Module for NAT            September 2018


   o  The port mapping, filtering, pooling, and fragment behaviors for
      each NAT instance.

   o  The set of protocols supported by each NAT instance.

   o  Address pools for each NAT instance, including for each pool the
      pool index, address realm, and minimum and maximum port number.

   o  Static address and port mapping entries.

   All the above parameters can be configured by means of the NAT YANG
   module.

   Unlike the NATV2-MIB, the NAT YANG module allows to configure
   multiple policies per NAT instance.

             unambiguously identify a user device (e.g., CPE).

             Subscriber mask is a system-wide configuration
             parameter that is used to enforce generic
             per-subscriber policies (e.g., port-quota).

             The enforcement of these generic policies does not
             require the configuration of every subscriber's
             prefix.

             Example: suppose the 2001:db8:100:100::/56 prefix
             is assigned to a NAT64 serviced CPE. Suppose also
             that 2001:db8:100:100::1 is the IPv6 address used
             by the client that resides in that CPE. When the
             NAT64 receives a packet from this client,
             it applies the subscriber-mask-v6 (e.g., 56) on
             the source IPv6 address to compute the associated
             prefix for this client (2001:db8:100:100::/56).
             Then, the NAT64 enforces policies based on that
             prefix (2001:db8:100:100::/56), not on the exact
             source IPv6 address.";

4.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations related to address and prefix translation are
   discussed in [RFC6888], [RFC6146], [RFC6877], [RFC6296], and
   [RFC7757].

Internet-Draft             YANG Module for NAT            September 2018


   The YANG module defined in this document is designed to be accessed
   via network management protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or
   RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport
   layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure
   Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the
   mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS [RFC5246].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   All data nodes defined in the YANG module which can be created,
   modified and deleted (i.e., config true, which is the default) are
   considered sensitive.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config) applied
   to these data nodes without proper protection can negatively affect
   network operations.  The NAT YANG module provides a method to set
   parameters to prevent a user from aggressively using NAT resources
   (port-quota), rate-limit connections as a guard against Denial-of-
   Service, or to enable notifications so that appropriate measures are
   enforced to anticipate traffic drops.  Nevertheless, an attacker who
   is able to access the NAT can undertake various attacks, such as:

   o  Set a high or low resource limit to cause a DoS attack:

      *  /nat/instances/instance/policy/port-quota

      *  /nat/instances/instance/policy/fragments-limit

      *  /nat/instances/instance/mapping-limits

      *  /nat/instances/instance/connection-limits

   o  Set a low notification threshold to cause useless notifications to
      be generated:

      *  /nat/instances/instance/policy/notify-pool-usage/high-threshold

      *  /nat/instances/instance/notification-limits/notify-addresses-
         usage

      *  /nat/instances/instance/notification-limits/notify-ports-usage

      *  /nat/instances/instance/notification-limits/notify-subscribers-
         limit

   o  Set an arbitrarily high threshold, which may lead to the
      deactivation of notifications:

      *  /nat/instances/instance/policy/notify-pool-usage/high-threshold

      *  /nat/instances/instance/notification-limits/notify-addresses-
         usage

      *  /nat/instances/instance/notification-limits/notify-ports-usage

      *  /nat/instances/instance/notification-limits/notify-subscribers-
         limit

   o  Set a low notification interval and a low notification threshold
      to induce useless notifications to be generated:

      *  /nat/instances/instance/policy/notify-pool-usage/notify-
         interval

      *  /nat/instances/instance/notification-limits/notify-interval

   o  Access to privacy data maintained in the mapping table.  Such data
      can be misused to track the activity of a host:

      *  /nat/instances/instance/mapping-table

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to register the following URI in the
   "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688]:

            URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-nat
            Registrant Contact: The IESG.
            XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.


   This document requests IANA to register the following YANG module in
   the "YANG Module Names" registry [RFC7950].

            name: ietf-nat
            namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-nat
            prefix: nat
            reference: RFC XXXX

A.1.  Traditional NAT44

   Traditional NAT44 is a Basic NAT44 or NAPT that is used to share the
   same IPv4 address among hosts that are owned by the same subscriber.
   This is typically the NAT that is embedded in CPE devices.

   This NAT is usually provided with one single external IPv4 address;
   disambiguating connections is achieved by rewriting the source port
   number.  The XML snippet to configure the external IPv4 address in
   such case together with a mapping entry is depicted below:

   <instances>
     <instance>
       <id>1</id>
       <name>NAT_Subscriber_A</name>
        ....
       <external-ip-address-pool>
         <pool-id>1</pool-id>
           <external-ip-pool>
             198.51.100.1/32
           </external-ip-pool>
         </external-ip-address-pool>
         ....
       <mapping-table>
         ....
         <external-src-address>
           198.51.100.1/32
         </external-src-address>
           ....
       </mapping-table>
     </instance>
   </instances>


   The following shows the XML excerpt depicting a dynamic UDP mapping
   entry maintained by a traditional NAPT44.  In reference to this
   example, the UDP packet received with a source IPv4 address
   (192.0.2.1) and source port number (1568) is translated into a UDP
   packet having a source IPv4 address (198.51.100.1) and source port
   (15000).  The remaining lifetime of this mapping is 300 seconds.

   The following XML snippet shows the example of a CGN that is
   provisioned with one contiguous pool of external IPv4 addresses
   (198.51.100.0/24).  Further, the CGN is instructed to limit the
   number of allocated ports per subscriber to 1024.  Ports can be
   allocated by the CGN by assigning ranges of 256 ports (that is, a
   subscriber can be allocated up to four port ranges of 256 ports
   each).

   For example, in order to disable NAT for communications issued by the
   client (192.0.2.1), the following configuration parameter must be
   set:

   <nat-pass-through>
     ...
     <prefix>192.0.2.1/32</prefix>
     ...
   </nat-pass-through>

A.4.  NAT64

   Let's consider the example of a NAT64 that should use
   2001:db8:122:300::/56 to perform IPv6 address synthesis [RFC6052].
   The XML snippet to configure the NAT64 prefix in such case is
   depicted below:

   <nat64-prefixes>
     <nat64-prefix>
       2001:db8:122:300::/56
     </nat64-prefix>
   </nat64-prefixes>

   Let's now consider the example of a NAT64 that should use
   2001:db8:122::/48 to perform IPv6 address synthesis [RFC6052] only if
   the destination address matches 198.51.100.0/24.  The XML snippet to
   configure the NAT64 prefix in such case is shown below:

   <nat64-prefixes>
     <nat64-prefix>
       2001:db8:122::/48
     </nat64-prefix>
     <destination-ipv4-prefix>
       <ipv4-prefix>
         198.51.100.0/24
       </ipv4-prefix>
     </destination-ipv4-prefix>
   </nat64-prefixes>

A.5.  Stateless IP/ICMP Translation (SIIT)

   Let's consider the example of a stateless translator that is
   configured with 2001:db8:100::/40 to perform IPv6 address synthesis
   [RFC6052].  Similar to the NAT64 case, the XML snippet to configure
   the NAT64 prefix in such case is depicted below:






Boucadair, et al.        Expires March 31, 2019                [Page 84]

Internet-Draft             YANG Module for NAT            September 2018


   <nat64-prefixes>
     <nat64-prefix>
       2001:db8:100::/40
     </nat64-prefix>
   </nat64-prefixes>

   When the translator receives an IPv6 packet, for example, with a
   source address (2001:db8:1c0:2:21::) and destination address
   (2001:db8:1c6:3364:2::), it extracts embedded IPv4 addresses
   following RFC6052 rules with 2001:db8:100::/40 as the NSP:

   o  192.0.2.33 is extracted from 2001:db8:1c0:2:21::

   o  198.51.100.2 is extracted from 2001:db8:1c6:3364:2::

   The translator transforms the IPv6 header into an IPv4 header using
   the IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm [RFC7915].  The IPv4 packets will
   include 192.0.2.33 as the source address and 198.51.100.2 as the
   destination address.

   Also, a NAT64 can be instructed to behave in the stateless mode by
   providing the following configuration.  The same NAT64 prefix is used
   for constructing both IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses and
   IPv4-converted IPv6 addresses (Section 3.3 of [RFC6052]).

   <nat64-prefixes>
     <nat64-prefix>
       2001:db8:122:300::/56
     </nat64-prefix>
     <stateless-enable>
       true
     </stateless-enable>
   </nat64-prefixes>

A.6.  Explicit Address Mappings for Stateless IP/ICMP Translation (EAM
      SIIT)

   As specified in [RFC7757], an EAM consists of an IPv4 prefix and an
   IPv6 prefix.  Let's consider the set of EAM examples in Table 8.

   destination IP address to 198.51.100.1.

   <dst-ip-address-pool>
     <pool-id>1</pool-id>
     <dst-in-ip-pool>
       192.0.2.1/32

       198.51.100.1/32
     </dst-out-ip-pool>
   </dst-ip-address-pool>

   In order to instruct a NAT to translate TCP packets destined to
   '192.0.2.1:80' to '198.51.100.1:8080', the following XML snippet
   shows the static mapping configured on the NAT:

   In order to instruct a NAT to translate TCP packets destined to
   '192.0.2.1:80' (http traffic) to 198.51.100.1 and '192.0.2.1:22' (ssh
   traffic) to 198.51.100.2, the following XML snippet shows the static
   mappings configured on the NAT:

   The NAT may also be instructed to proceed with both source and
   destination NAT.  To do so, in addition to the above sample to
   configure destination NAT, the NAT may be provided, for example with
   a pool of external IP addresses (198.51.100.0/24) to use for source

   address translation.  An example of the corresponding XML snippet is
   provided hereafter:

   <external-ip-address-pool>
     <pool-id>1</pool-id>
     <external-ip-pool>
       198.51.100.0/24
     </external-ip-pool>
   </external-ip-address-pool>

   Instead of providing an external IP address to share, the NAT may be
   configured with static mapping entries that modify the internal IP
   address and/or port number.

A.10.  Customer-side Translator (CLAT)

   The following XML snippet shows the example of a CLAT that is
   configured with 2001:db8:1234::/96 as PLAT-side IPv6 prefix and
   2001:db8:aaaa::/96 as CLAT-side IPv6 prefix.  The CLAT is also
   provided with 192.0.0.1/32 (which is selected from the IPv4 service
   continuity prefix defined in [RFC7335]).

   <clat-ipv6-prefixes>
     <ipv6-prefix>
       2001:db8:aaaa::/96
     </ipv6-prefix>
   </clat-ipv6-prefixes>
   <clat-ipv4-prefixes>
     <ipv4-prefix>
       192.0.0.1/32
     </ipv4-prefix>
   </clat-ipv4-prefixes>
   <nat64-prefixes>
     <nat64-prefix>
       2001:db8:1234::/96
     </nat64-prefix>
   </nat64-prefixes>

A.11.  IPv6 Network Prefix Translation (NPTv6)

   Let's consider the example of an NPTv6 translator that should rewrite
   packets with the source prefix (fd03:c03a:ecab::/48) with the
   external prefix (2001:db8:1::/48).  The internal interface is "eth0"
   while the external interface is "eth1" (Figure 2).

                  External Network:  Prefix = 2001:db8:1::/48

                                 +-------------+
                                        |eth0
                                        |
                      --------------------------------------
                  Internal Network:  Prefix = fd03:c03a:ecab::/48

                        Figure 2: Example of NPTv6

   The XML snippet to configure NPTv6 prefixes in such case is depicted
   below:

   <nptv6-prefixes>
     <internal-ipv6-prefix>
       fd03:c03a:ecab::/48
     </internal-ipv6-prefix>
     <external-ipv6-prefix>
       2001:db8:1::/48
     </external-ipv6-prefix>
   </nptv6-prefixes>
   ...
   <external-realm>
     <external-interface>
       eth1
     </external-interface>
   </external-realm>

   Figure 3 shows an example of an NPTv6 translator that interconnects
   two internal networks (fd03:c03a:ecab::/48 and fda8:d5cb:14f3::/48);
   each is translated using a dedicated prefix (2001:db8:1::/48 and
   2001:db8:6666::/48, respectively).

   To that aim, the following configuration is provided to the NPTv6
   translator:
