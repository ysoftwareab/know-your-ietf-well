1.  Introduction
    
    The lemonade work [LEMONADE-PROFILE] identified a need to provide
    notification and filtering mechanisms for use with IMAP [IMAP].
    
    In addition, external groups which make use of IETF work also
    expressed such requirements (see, for example, [OMA-LEMONADE-ARCH];
    OMA requirements for within-IMAP ("inband") and out-of-IMAP
    ("outband") server to client notifications are listed in
    [OMA-ME-RD]).
    
    
1.1.  Conventions Used in this Document
    
    Within this document, the terms "Lemonade Profile" and "Lemonade"
    generally refer to the revised Lemonade Profile document
    [LEMONADE-PROFILE].

2.  Notifications logical architecture and LEMONADE Profile
    
    The target logical architecture for the LEMONADE Profile is
    described in the revised Lemonade Profile document
    [LEMONADE-PROFILE].
    
    Figure 1 illustrates how notification and filtering fit in the
    context of Lemonade.

                Figure 1: Filtering mechanism defined in
                    Lemonade Profile architecture. 
    
    
    In Figure 1, four categories of filters are defined:
    
    1.   AF:  Administrative Filters:  Created and maintained by mail
    admin.  AF are typically not configured by the user and are used to
    apply policies, content filtering, virus protection, spam filtering,
    etc.

    2.   DF:  Deposit Filters:  Executed on deposit of new mail.  Can be
    defined as SIEVE filters [SIEVE].
    
    3.   VF:  View Filters:  Define which messages are important to a
    client.  May be implemented as pseudo-virtual mailboxes [CONTEXT].
    Clients may use this to restrict which messages they synchronize.
    
    4.   NF:  Notification Filters:  Determines when out-of-IMAP
    ("outband") notifications are sent to the client.  These filters can
    be implemented either in the message store, or in a separate
    notifications engine.
    
    Note that when implementing DF or NF using Sieve, the 'enotify'
    [SIEVE-NOTIFY] and likely the 'variables' [SIEVE-VARIABLES] Sieve
    extensions might be needed.
    
    The filters are manageable by the client as follows:
    
    *    NF and DF:  When internal to the mail store, these are
    typically implemented using Sieve and hence a Sieve management
    protocol is used for client modifications.  See [MANAGE-SIEVE] for
    more information.  Per-mailbox notifications might be implemented
    using a per-mailbox Sieve script, for example, [IMAP-SIEVE].  When
    the NF is within a notification server, it is out of scope of
    Lemonade.
    
    *    VF: via pseudo-virtual mailboxes as defined in [CONTEXT].
    
    In Figure 1, the NF are shown both as part of the mail store (for
    example, using Sieve) and as an external notification server.
    Either approach can be used.

    For in-IMAP ("inband") notifications, the MUA (client) issues IDLE
    [IDLE], or the successor extension command NOTIFY [NOTIFY]; the
    LEMONADE IMAP server sends notifications as unsolicited responses to
    the client.
    
    Out-of-IMAP ("outband") notifications are messages sent to the user
    or client not through IMAP.  When directed at the user, they are
    human-consumable and intended to alert the user.  When directed at
    the client, they are machine-consumable and may be acted upon by the
    receiver in various ways, for example, fetching data from the mail
    store or resynchronizing one or more mailboxes, updating internal
    state information, and alerting the user.
    
    
4.  Push Email
    
    A good user experience of "push email" requires that when
    "interesting" events occur in the mail store, the client is informed
    so that it can connect and resynchronize.  The Lemonade Profile
    [LEMONADE-PROFILE] contains more information, especially in the
    Section titled "External Notifications".
    
    
5.  Server-to-Server Notifications Rationale
    
    With server to server notifications, a mail system generates event
    notifications.  These notifications describe mailbox state change
    events such as arrival of a new message, mailbox full, and so forth.


Gellens                  [Page 5]                  Expires December 2008

Internet Draft       Lemonade Notifications Architecture       June 2008


    See [MSGEVENT] for a list of such events.
    
    These state change notifications are sent to a notification system,
    which may generate alerts or notifications for delivery to one or
    more clients or the user.
    
    Server to server notifications allow the mail system to generate end
    user or client notifications without needing to keep track of
    notification settings for users or clients; the notification system
    maintains notification preferences for clients and users.
    
    Using server to server notifications, the mail system can provide
    the end user with a unified notification experience (the same look
    and feel for all messaging systems' accounts, such as email and
    voice mail), while allowing smooth integration of additional
    messaging systems.
    
    
5.1.  Notifications Discussion
    
    The POP3 and IMAP4 Internet mail protocols allow mail clients to
    access and manipulate electronic mail messages on mail systems.  By
    definition and scope, these protocols do not provide off-line
    methods to notify an end user when the mailbox state changes.  Nor
    does either protocol define a way to aggregate the status within the
    end user's various mailboxes.
    
    The desire for this functionality is obvious.  For example, from the
    very early days of electronic mail, various notifications mechanisms
    have been used, including login shell checks, and simple hacks such
    as [BIFF].
    
    To provide an end user with unified notifications and one
    centralized message-waiting indication (MWI), notification
    mechanisms are needed which aggregate the information of all the
    events occurring on the end user's different messaging systems.
    
    Server to server notifications allow the messaging system to send
    state change events to the notification system when something
    happens in or to an end user's mailbox.
    
    Notification systems can be broadly grouped into three general
    architectures: external smart clients, intrinsic notification, and
    separate notification mechanisms.
    
    External smart clients are agents independent of the mail system
    that periodically check mailbox state (or receive notifications, for
    example via IMAP IDLE) and inform the user or the user's mail
    client.  Many such systems have been used over the years, including


Gellens                  [Page 6]                  Expires December 2008

Internet Draft       Lemonade Notifications Architecture       June 2008


    login shells that check the user's mail spool, laptop/desktop tiny
    clients that periodically poll the user's mail servers, etc.
    
    Intrinsic notification is any facility within a mail system that
    generates notifications, for example the server component of [BIFF],
    or, for more modern systems, the recent Sieve extensions for
    notifications [SIEVE-NOTIFY].
    
    Separate notification systems decouple the state change event
    notification from the end-user or client notification, allowing a
    mail system to do the former, and specialized systems (such as those
    which handle presence) to be responsible for the latter.  This
    separation is architecturally cleaner, since the mail system only
    needs to support one additional protocol (for communication to the
    notification system) instead of multiple notification delivery
    protocols, and does not need to keep track of which clients and
    which users are interested in which events.  It also allows
    notifications to be generated for any service, not just electronic
    mail.  However, it requires a new service (the notification system)
    and the mail system needs to support an additional protocol (to
    communicate with the notification system).
    
    In addition to any external notification mechanisms, Sieve can be
    used for notifications [SIEVE-NOTIFY].  Since many mail systems
    already provide Sieve support, it is often a fairly easy and quick
    deployment option to provide a useful form of notifications.
    
    
5.2.  Server to Server Notifications Scope
    
    For the purposes of the Lemonade work, the scope of server to server
    notifications is limited to communications between the mail system
    and the notification system (the third architectural type described
    in Section 5.1).  Communication between the notification system and
    the end user or devices (which might use SMS, WAP Push, instant
    messaging, etc.) is out of scope.  Likewise, the scope generally
    presumes a security relationship between the mail system and the
    notification system.  Thus the security relationship then becomes
    the responsibility of the notification system.  However, the
    specifics of security, trust relationships, and related issues
    depend on the specifics of both server to server notifications and
    notification systems.

5.3.  Basic Operation
    
    The mail system sends state change event notifications to the
    notification system (which in turn might notify a client or end
    user) for events that occur in the end user's mailboxes.  Each such
    notification, referring to a single mailbox event, is called a state
    change event.

Internet Draft       Lemonade Notifications Architecture       June 2008


    The state change event contains data regarding the mailbox event
    which has occurred.  The state change event describes the change,
    but normally does not specify how or if the end user or client is
    notified; this allows the end user and client notification
    preferences to be maintained only within the notification server.
    
    From the Lemonade viewpoint, out-of-IMAP (outband) notifications are
    usually desired only when the client is not connected to the IMAP
    server (since inband notifications are used when there is an IMAP
    connection).  Thus, it is helpful for the mail system to be able to
    inform the notification system when the user logs in or out, and
    which client is used (when this information is available).
    
    When Sieve is used, the Sieve engine might have access to this
    information.
    
    A message is generated by the message store as a result of a state
    change event.  This message may be delivered to the end user, a
    client, or to an external notification server which might deliver an
    equivalent message to the user or to a client.
    
    Within the context of Lemonade profile (Figure 1), the event is
    filtered by NF.  That is, the Notification Filters logically
    determine which state change events cause notification to the user
    or client.
    
    Notifications allow for a rich end user experience.  This might
    include conveying mailbox status, new message attributes, etc., to
    the user or client independent of the client's connection to the
    mail store.
    
    Notifications also allow for different Message Waiting Indicator
    (MWI) behaviors (e.g., turn MWI indication off after all the
    messages in all the end user's mailboxes have been read, should such
    an unlikely thing occur in the real world).
    
    The payload of a notification might include a URL referring to the
    message which caused the event, possibly using URLAUTH [URLAUTH].
    
    As state change events occur in the mail store, they are filtered,
    which is to say matched against client or user preferences.  As a
    result, a notification may or may not be generated for delivery to
    the user or client.
    
    In the most general case, the mail system sends bulk state change
    events to an external notification server, and it is the
    notification server that filters the events by matching against the
    user's or client's preferences.

Internet Draft       Lemonade Notifications Architecture       June 2008


    In the most mail-specific case, the mail system performs the
    filtering itself, for example using Sieve.
    
    
5.4.  Event order
    
    For Lemonade profile, the event order is generally not important.
    By including information such as the modification sequence
    identifier (called a modseq or mod-sequence) [CONDSTORE] in
    notifications, the receiving client can quickly and easily determine
    if it has already processed the triggering event (for example, if a
    notification arrives out of order, or if the client has
    resynchronized).
    
    For generic server to server notifications, the order is likely to
    matter and the mail system needs to provide notifications to the
    notification system in the order that they occur.
    
    
5.5.  Reliability
    
    For the Lemonade profile, lost or delayed notifications to the
    client are tolerated.  A client can resynchronize its state
    (including that reported by any missing events) when it next
    connects to the server.
    
    For generic server to server notifications, it is assumed that the
    data in a state change event is important, and therefore a high
    level of reliability is needed between the mail system and any
    external notification systems.
    
    
6.  Security Considerations
    
    Notification content (payload) needs to be protected against
    eavesdropping and alteration when it contains specific information
    from messages, such as the sender.
    
    Even when the content is trivial and does not contain
    privacy-sensitive information, guarding against denial of service
    attacks may require authentication or verification of the
    notification sender.
    
    Protocols which manipulate filters need mechanisms to protect
    against modification by as well as disclosure to unauthorized
    entities.  For example, a malicious entity might try to delete
    notifications the user wants, or try to flood the target device with
    notifications to incur usage charges, or prevent normal use.  In
    addition, the filters themselves might contain sensitive information
