   This document defines a RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial In User
   Service) attribute that carries an IPv6 prefix that is to be
   delegated to the user.  This attribute is usable within either RADIUS
   or Diameter.

Internet-Draft       Delegated-IPv6-Prefix Attribute        October 2006


1.  Introduction

   This document defines the Delegated-IPv6-Prefix attribute as a RADIUS
   [1] attribute that carries an IPv6 prefix to be delegated to the
   user, for use in the user's network.  For example, the prefix in a
   Delegated-IPv6-Prefix attribute can be delegated to another node
   through DHCP Prefix Delegation [2].

   The Delegated-IPv6-Prefix attribute can be used in DHCP Prefix
   Delegation between the delegating router and a RADIUS server, as
   illustrated in the following message sequence.



  Requeting Router     Delegating Router                   RADIUS Server

         |-Request(Prefix)---->|                                 |

                DHCP PD                      RADIUS


   The Framed-IPv6-Prefix attribute [4] is not designed to support
   delegation of IPv6 prefixes to be used in the user's network, and
   therefore Framed-IPv6-Prefix and Delegated-IPv6-Prefix attributes may
   be included in the same RADIUS packet.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].


3.  Attribute format

   The format of the Delegated-IPv6-Prefix is:

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


       Type

            TBD for Delegated-IPv6-Prefix

       Length

            The length of the entire attribute, in bytes.  At least 4
            (to hold Type/Length/Reserved/Prefix-Length for a 0-bit
            prefix), and no larger than 20 (to hold Type/Length/
            Reserved/Prefix-Length for a 128-bit prefix)

       Reserved

            Always set to zero by sender; ignored by receiver

       Prefix-Length

            The length of the prefix being delegated, in bits.  At least
            0 and no larger than 128 bits (identifying a single IPv6
            address)

   Note that the prefix field is only required to be long enough to hold
   the prefix bits and can be shorter than 16 bytes.  Any bits in the
   prefix field that are not part of the prefix MUST be zero.

   The Delegated-IPv6-Prefix MAY appear in an Access-Accept packet, and
   can appear multiple times.  It MAY appear in an Access-Request packet
   as a hint by the NAS to the server that it would prefer these
   prefix(es), but the server is not required to honor the hint.

   The Delegated-IPv6-Prefix attribute MAY appear in an Accounting-
   Request packet.

Internet-Draft       Delegated-IPv6-Prefix Attribute        October 2006


   The Delegated-IPv6-Prefix MUST NOT appear in any other RADIUS
   packets.


4.  Table of Attributes

   The following table provides a guide to which attributes may be found
   in which kinds of packets, and in what quantity.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Request Accept Reject Challenge Accounting  #   Attribute             |
|                                 Request                               |
| 0+      0+     0      0         0+          TBD Delegated-IPv6-Prefix |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

   The meaning of the above table entries is as follows:
      0 This attribute MUST NOT be present.
      0+ Zero or more instances of this attribute MAY be present.
      0-1 Zero or one instance of this attribute MAY be present.
      1 Exactly one instance of this attribute MUST be present.
      1+ One or more of these attributes MUST be present.


5.  Diameter Considerations

   When used in Diameter, the attribute defined in this specification
   can be used as a Diameter AVP from the Code space 1-255, i.e., RADIUS
   attribute compatibility space.  No additional Diameter Code values
   are therefore allocated.  The data types of the attributes are as
   follows:

        Delegated-IPv6-Prefix             OctetString

   The attribute in this specification has no special translation
   requirements for Diameter to RADIUS or RADIUS to Diameter gateways,
   i.e., the attribute is copied as is, except for changes relating to
   headers, alignment, and padding.  See also RFC 3588 [5], Section 4.1,
   and RFC 4005 [6], Section 9.

   The text in this specification describing the applicability of the
   Delegated-IPv6-Prefix attribute for RADIUS Access-Request applies in
   Diameter to AA-Request [6] or Diameter-EAP-Request [7].

   The text in this specification describing the applicability of the
   Delegated-IPv6-Prefix attribute for RADIUS Access-Accept applies in
   Diameter to AA-Answer or Diameter-EAP-Answer that indicates success.

   The text in this specification describing the applicability of the

Internet-Draft       Delegated-IPv6-Prefix Attribute        October 2006


   Delegated-IPv6-Prefix attribute for RADIUS Accounting-Request applies
   to Diameter Accounting-Request [6] as well.

   The AVP flag rules [5] for the Delegate-IPv6-Prefix attribute are:

                                      +---------------------+
                                      |    AVP Flag rules   |
                                      |----+-----+----+-----|----+

     ---------------------------------|----+-----+----+-----|----|


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a Type value, TBD, for this attribute
   from the RADIUS Attribute Types registry.


7.  Security Considerations

   Known security vulnerabilities of the RADIUS protocol are discussed
   in RFC 2607 [8], RFC 2865 [1] and RFC 2869 [9].  Use of IPsec [10]
   for providing security when RADIUS is carried in IPv6 is discussed in
   RFC 3162.

   Security considerations for the Diameter protocol are discussed in
   RFC 3588 [5].
