 Signaling MSD (Maximum SID Depth) using Border Gateway Protocol - Link
                                 State
              draft-ietf-idr-bgp-ls-segment-routing-msd-18

Abstract

   This document defines a way for a Border Gateway Protocol - Link
   State (BGP-LS) speaker to advertise multiple types of supported
   Maximum SID Depths (MSDs) at node and/or link granularity.

   Such advertisements allow entities (e.g., centralized controllers) to
   determine whether a particular Segment Identifier (SID) stack can be
   supported in a given network.

1.  Introduction

   When Segment Routing (SR) [RFC8402] paths are computed by a
   centralized controller, it is critical that the controller learns the
   Maximum SID Depth (MSD) that can be imposed at each node/link on a
   given SR path.  This ensures that the Segment Identifier (SID) stack
   depth of a computed path doesn't exceed the number of SIDs the node
   is capable of imposing.

   [RFC8664] defines how to signal MSD in the Path Computation Element
   Protocol (PCEP).  The OSPF and IS-IS extensions for signaling of MSD
   are defined in [RFC8476] and [RFC8491] respectively.

Internet-Draft         Signaling MSD using BGP-LS               May 2020


   However, if PCEP is not supported/configured on the head-end of a SR
   tunnel or a Binding-SID anchor node, and the controller does not
   participate in IGP routing, it has no way of learning the MSD of
   nodes and links.  BGP-LS [RFC7752] defines a way to expose topology
   and associated attributes and capabilities of the nodes in that
   topology to a centralized controller.

   This document defines extensions to BGP-LS to advertise one or more
   types of MSDs at node and/or link granularity.  Other types of MSD
   are known to be useful.  For example, [I-D.ietf-ospf-mpls-elc] and
   [I-D.ietf-isis-mpls-elc] define Readable Label Depth Capability
   (RLDC) that is used by a head-end to insert an Entropy Label (EL) at
   a depth that can be read by transit nodes.

   In the future, it is expected that new MSD-Types will be defined to
   signal additional capabilities, e.g., ELs, SIDs that can be imposed
   through recirculation, or SIDs associated with another data plane
   such as IPv6.  MSD advertisements may be useful even if SR itself is
   not enabled.  For example, in a non-SR MPLS network, MSD defines the
   maximum label depth.

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

1.1.1.  Terminology

   MSD: Maximum SID Depth - the number of SIDs supported by a node or a
   link on a node

   PCE: Path Computation Element

   PCEP: Path Computation Element Protocol

   SID: Segment Identifier as defined in [RFC8402]

   SR: Segment Routing

   Label Imposition: Imposition is the act of modifying and/or adding
   labels to the outgoing label stack associated with a packet.  This
   includes:

   o  replacing the label at the top of the label stack with a new
      label.

   o  pushing one or more new labels onto the label stack.

   o  The number of labels imposed is then the sum of the number of
      labels that are replaced and the number of labels that are pushed.
      See [RFC3031] for further details.

1.1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here .

2.  Advertisement of MSD via BGP-LS

   This document describes extensions that enable BGP-LS speakers to
   signal the MSD capabilities ([RFC8491] ) of nodes and their links in
   a network to a BGP-LS consumer of network topology such as a
   centralized controller.  The centralized controller can leverage this
   information in computation of SR paths based on their MSD
   capabilities.  When a BGP-LS speaker is originating the topology
   learnt via link-state routing protocols such as OSPF or IS-IS, the
   MSD information for the nodes and their links is sourced from the
   underlying extensions as defined in [RFC8476] and [RFC8491]
   respectively.

   The extensions introduced in this document allow for advertisement of
   different MSD-Types, which are defined elsewhere and were introduced
   in [RFC8491].  This enables sharing of MSD-Types that may be defined
   in the future by the IGPs in BGP-LS.

3.  Node MSD TLV

   The Node MSD ([RFC8476] [RFC8491]) is encoded in a new Node Attribute
   TLV [RFC7752] to carry the provisioned SID depth of the router
   identified by the corresponding Router-ID.  Node MSD is the smallest
   MSD supported by the node on the set of interfaces configured for
   use.  MSD values may be learned via a hardware API or may be
   provisioned.  The following format is used:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |              Type             |             Length            |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |    MSD-Type   |  MSD-Value    |  MSD-Type...  |  MSD-Value... |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   o  Length: variable (multiple of 2); represents the total length of
      the value field in octets.

   o  Value : consists of one or more pairs of a 1-octet MSD-Type and
      1-octet MSD-Value.

      *  MSD-Type : one of the values defined in the "IGP MSD-Types"
         registry defined in [RFC8491].

      *  MSD-Value : a number in the range of 0-255.  For all MSD-Types,
         0 represents the lack of ability to impose an MSD stack of any
         depth; any other value represents that of the node.  This value
         MUST represent the lowest value supported by any link
         configured for use by the advertising protocol instance.

4.  Link MSD TLV

   The Link MSD ([RFC8476] [RFC8491]) is defined to carry the MSD of the
   interface associated with the link.  It is encoded in a new Link
   Attribute TLV [RFC7752] using the following format:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |              Type             |             Length            |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |    MSD-Type   |  MSD-Value    |  MSD-Type...  |  MSD-Value... |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                       Figure 2: Link MSD TLV Format

   Where:

   o  Type: 267

   o  Length: variable (multiple of 2); represents the total length of
      the value field in octets.

   o  Value : consists of one or more pairs of a 1-octet MSD-Type and
      1-octet MSD-Value.

      *  MSD-Type : MSD-Type : one of the values defined in the "IGP
         MSD-Types" registry defined in [RFC8491].

      *  MSD-Value : a number in the range of 0-255.  For all MSD-Types,
         0 represents the lack of ability to impose an MSD stack of any
         depth; any other value represents that of the link when used as
         an outgoing interface.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests assigning code-points from the registry "BGP-
   LS Node Descriptor, Link Descriptor, Prefix Descriptor, and Attribute
   TLVs" based on table below.  Early allocation for these code-points
   have been done by IANA.

|    267     | Link MSD        | (22,23,25,141,222,223)/15 |   This document   |
+------------+-----------------+---------------------------+-------------------+


6.  Manageability Considerations

   The new protocol extensions introduced in this document augment the
   existing IGP topology information that is distributed via [RFC7752].
   Procedures and protocol extensions defined in this document do not
   affect the BGP protocol operations and management other than as
   discussed in the Manageability Considerations section of [RFC7752].
   Specifically, the malformed attribute tests for syntactic checks in
   the Fault Management section of [RFC7752] now encompass the new BGP-
   LS Attribute TLVs defined in this document.  The semantic or content
   checking for the TLVs specified in this document and their
   association with the BGP-LS NLRI types or their BGP-LS Attribute is
   left to the consumer of the BGP-LS information (e.g. an application
   or a controller) and not the BGP protocol.

   A consumer of the BGP-LS information retrieves this information over
   a BGP-LS session (refer Section 1 and 2 of [RFC7752]).

   This document only introduces new Attribute TLVs and any syntactic
   error in them would result in the BGP-LS Attribute being discarded
   [RFC7752].  The MSD information introduced in BGP-LS by this
   specification, may be used by BGP-LS consumer applications like a SR
   PCE to learn the SR SID stack handling capabilities of the nodes in
   the topology.  This can enable the SR PCE to perform path
   computations taking into consideration the size of SID stack that the
   specific head-end node may be able to impose.  Errors in the encoding
   or decoding of the MSD information may result in the unavailability
   of such information to the SR PCE or incorrect information being made
   available to it.  This may result in the head-end node not being able
   to instantiate the desired SR path in its forwarding and provide the
   SR based optimization functionality.  The handling of such errors by
   applications like SR PCE may be implementation specific and out of
   scope of this document.

   The extensions specified in this document do not specify any new
   configuration or monitoring aspects in BGP or BGP-LS.  The
   specification of BGP models is an ongoing work based on the
   [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-model].

7.  Security Considerations

   The advertisement of an incorrect MSD value may have negative
   consequences.  If the value is smaller than supported, path
   computation may fail to compute a viable path.  If the value is
   larger than supported, an attempt to instantiate a path that can't be
   supported by the head-end (the node performing the SID imposition)
   may occur.  The presence of this information may also inform an
   attacker of how to induce any of the aforementioned conditions.

   The procedures and protocol extensions defined in this document do
   not affect the BGP security model.  See the "Security Considerations"
   section of [RFC4271] for a discussion of BGP security.  Also, refer
   to [RFC4272] and [RFC6952] for analyses of security issues for BGP.
   Security considerations for acquiring and distributing BGP-LS
   information are discussed in [RFC7752].  The TLVs introduced in this
   document are used to propagate the MSD IGP extensions defined in
   [RFC8476] [RFC8491].  It is assumed that the IGP instances
   originating these TLVs will support all the required security (as
   described in [RFC8476] [RFC8491]) in order to prevent any security
   issues when propagating the TLVs into BGP-LS.  The advertisement of
   the node and link attribute information defined in this document
   presents no significant additional risk beyond that associated with
   the existing node and link attribute information already supported in
   [RFC7752].
