1.  Introduction

   Homenet, as seen by the IETF Homenet working group, operates as a set
   of IPv6 routers performing source/destination based routing.  Since
   an arbitrary number of routers in an arbitrary dynamic topology is to
   be supported, a dynamic routing protocol is needed.  This document
   outlines how to apply IS-IS for this.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Required specifications

   The following (parts of) specifications MUST be implemented for a
   homenet IS-IS router:

   Parts of ISO 10589-2002: [IS-IS]

   o  Section 6.1, Level 1 Intermediate System

   o  Section 6.2, bullet a) - broadcast subnetworks

   o  Section 6, remainder (6.3 - 6.8.4)

   o  Section 7, Level 1 IS function only

      *  exclude Section 7.2.2 (replaced by wide metrics)

      *  exclude Section 7.2.9 (Level 2 interactions)

      *  exclude Section 7.2.10 (Partition repair)

Internet-Draft           Homenet IS-IS Profile                April 2016


      *  exclude Section 7.4 (Forwarding process), replaced by IPv6
         forwarder behavior

   o  Sections 8.2 and 8.4

   o  Section 9, excluding PDU types specific to Level 2 operation

   o  Sections 10.1 and 10.2

   Generally speaking, a homenet IS-IS implementation needs to operate
   in a network consisting purely of Level 1 Intermediate Systems.

   The following updates to the IS-IS specification:

   o  [RFC5120], M-ISIS: Multitopology Routing

   o  [RFC5303], IS-IS 3-way Adjacency TLV

   o  [RFC5305], IS-IS Extensions for Traffic Engineering

      *  wide metrics and IP prefix encoding

      *  Sub-TLVs 3, 9, 10, 11, 18 not required

   o  [RFC5308], Routing IPv6 with IS-IS

   o  [I-D.liu-isis-auto-conf], IS-IS Autoconfiguration

   o  [I-D.baker-ipv6-isis-dst-src-routing], IS-IS IPv6 Source/
      Destination Routing

   o  [I-D.lamparter-isis-p2mp], IS-IS Point to Multipoint operation

   And, finally, IPv6 source/destination routing behavior as specified
   in [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-dst-src-routing].

3.  Parameter choices

   Most configuration parameters are specified in
   [I-D.liu-isis-auto-conf] as part of IS-IS autoconfiguration.

   Homenet uses the following additional parameter choices:

   o  IPv6 is routed in M-ISIS topology with MTID #2.

   o  IPv4, if supported, is routed in the base topology (MTID #0).

4.  Optional additions for IPv4 operation

   Supporting IPv4 for backwards compatibility requires implementation
   of [RFC1195].

5.  Security and Privacy Considerations

   This document has no independent security or privacy concerns.  Those
   in the referenced documents apply.

6.  Acknowledgements
