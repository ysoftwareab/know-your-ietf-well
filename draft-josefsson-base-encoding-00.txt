1. Base 64 Encoding

   The following description of base64 is due to [1] and [2].

   A 65-character subset of US-ASCII is used, enabling 6 bits to be
   represented per printable character. (The extra 65th character, "=",
   is used to signify a special processing function.)

   The encoding process represents 24-bit groups of input bits as
   output strings of 4 encoded characters. Proceeding from left to
   right, a 24-bit input group is formed by concatenating 3 8-bit input
   groups.  These 24 bits are then treated as 4 concatenated 6-bit
   groups, each of which is translated into a single digit in the base
   64 alphabet.

   Each 6-bit group is used as an index into an array of 64 printable
   characters. The character referenced by the index is placed in the
   output string.

   Special processing is performed if fewer than 24 bits are available
   at the end of the data being encoded.  A full encoding quantum is
   always completed at the end of a quantity. When fewer than 24 input
   bits are available in an input group, zero bits are added (on the
   right) to form an integral number of 6-bit groups.  Padding at the
   end of the data is performed using the '=' character.  Since all
   base 64 input is an integral number of octets, only the following
   cases can arise:

   (1) the final quantum of encoding input is an integral multiple of
   24 bits; here, the final unit of encoded output will be an integral
   multiple of 4 characters with no "=" padding,

   (2) the final quantum of encoding input is exactly 8 bits; here, the
   final unit of encoded output will be two characters followed by two
   "=" padding characters, or

   (3) the final quantum of encoding input is exactly 16 bits; here,
   the final unit of encoded output will be three characters followed
   by one "=" padding character.

   Any characters outside of the base64 alphabet are to be ignored in
   base64-encoded data.

2. Base 32 Encoding

   The following description of base32 is due to [3], the padding
   section was updated to fix two typos.

   The Base32 encoding is designed to represent arbitrary sequences of
   octets in a form that needs to be case insensitive but need not be
   humanly readable.

   A 33-character subset of US-ASCII is used, enabling 5 bits to be
   represented per printable character. (The extra 33rd character, "=",
   is used to signify a special processing function.)

   The encoding process represents 40-bit groups of input bits as
   output strings of 8 encoded characters.  Proceeding from left to
   right, a 40-bit input group is formed by concatenating 5 8bit input
   groups.  These 40 bits are then treated as 8 concatenated 5-bit
   groups, each of which is translated into a single digit in the
   base32 alphabet.  When encoding a bit stream via the base32
   encoding, the bit stream must be presumed to be ordered with the
   most-significant-bit first. That is, the first bit in the stream
   will be the high-order bit in the first 8bit byte, and the eighth
   bit will be the low-order bit in the first 8bit byte, and so on.

   Each 5-bit group is used as an index into an array of 32 printable
   characters.  The character referenced by the index is placed in the
   output string.  These characters, identified in Table 2, below, are
   selected from US-ASCII digits and uppercase letters.

                          Table 2: The Base32 Alphabet

               2 C            11 L            20 U            29 5
               3 D            12 M            21 V            30 6

               5 F            14 O            23 X
               6 G            15 P            24 Y         (pad) =

               8 I            17 R            26 2


   Special processing is performed if fewer than 40 bits are available
   at the end of the data being encoded.  A full encoding quantum is
   always completed at the end of a body. When fewer than 40 input bits
   are available in an input group, zero bits are added (on the right)
   to form an integral number of 5-bit groups.  Padding at the end of
   the data is performed using the "=" character.  Since all base32

   input is an integral number of octets, only the following cases can
   arise:

   (1) the final quantum of encoding input is an integral multiple of
   40 bits; here, the final unit of encoded output will be an integral
   multiple of 8 characters with no "=" padding,

   (2) the final quantum of encoding input is exactly 8 bits; here, the
   final unit of encoded output will be two characters followed by six
   "=" padding characters,

   (3) the final quantum of encoding input is exactly 16 bits; here,
   the final unit of encoded output will be four characters followed by
   four "=" padding characters,

   (4) the final quantum of encoding input is exactly 24 bits; here,
   the final unit of encoded output will be five characters followed by
   three "=" padding characters, or

   (5) the final quantum of encoding input is exactly 32 bits; here,
   the final unit of encoded output will be seven characters followed
   by one "=" padding character.

   Because it is used only for padding at the end of the data, the
   occurrence of any "=" characters may be taken as evidence that the
   end of the data has been reached (without truncation in transit). 
   No such assurance is possible, however, when the number of octets
   transmitted was a multiple of three and no "=" characters are
   present.

   Any characters outside of the base32 alphabet are to be ignored in
   base32-encoded data.

3. Base 16 Encoding

   The following description is original but analog to previous
   descriptions.

   A 16-character subset of US-ASCII is used, enabling 4 bits to be
   represented per printable character.

   The encoding process represents 8-bit groups (octets) of input bits
   as output strings of 2 encoded characters. Proceeding from left to
   right, a 8-bit input is taken from the input data.  These 8 bits are
   then treated as 2 concatenated 4-bit groups, each of which is
   translated into a single digit in the base 16 alphabet.

   Each 4-bit group is used as an index into an array of 16 printable
   characters. The character referenced by the index is placed in the
   output string.

                            Table 3: The Base 16 Alphabet

         Value Encoding  Value Encoding  Value Encoding  Value Encoding
             0 A             5 F            10 K            15 P
             1 B             6 G            11 L            16 Q
             2 C             7 H            12 M
             3 D             8 I            13 N
             4 E             9 J            14 O

   Unlike base32 and base64, no special padding is necessery since a
   full code words are always available.

   Any characters outside of the base32 alphabet are to be ignored in
   base32-encoded data.
