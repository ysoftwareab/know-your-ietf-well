1.  Introduction

   In the current wireless communication network, there are various
   kinds of wireless access technologies around our environment, even in
   one mobile operator's network, there are several choices for
   subscriber to choose.  It become obvious that multiple connections
   have to be supported by mobile terminals.

   Currently, each individual wireless communication technology has
   independent connection commands and triggers, as well as mobility
   management and configuration.  For example, 802.11 specify
   "Associate/Deassociate/Reassociate", WCDMA/LTE/TDS-CDMA specify "RRC
   setup/release", and WiMAX specify "MAC Ranging" et al.

   Mobile terminal normally use each specific interface to control its
   connection, mobility management and configurations et al.  Terminal
   software have to study each interface characteristics.  This
   phenomena become more serious when the request of terminal for
   multiple connections comes.

   There were some proposals to extend link layer to make a common
   ground for this operation, but it will cost to revise some chipset or
   kernel level.  This make it hard to realize.  But solution such as
   defining a more high level interface and independent on link layer
   may meet the requirement.  And it will be quite convenient for the
   mobile operator to handle if the connection, mobility, and
   configuration management will be based on a common protocol which
   don't rely on link layer technology.

2.  Multiple Network Connections

   Multiple Network Connection has become obvious requirement for
   wireless data communications.  Operator may think about efficient
   using radio resource.  Subscriber may think about different price for
   different connections.  Some connections may be flat rate based,
   others may be transmitted packet based.  Or some connection has
   better Quality of Service or no traffic filter exist.

   The multiple network connections for mobile terminal is shown in the
   figure below:

                x            y            v            z            xi
                |            |            |            |            |
          +-----+      +-----+      +-----+      +-----+      +-----+
          | MAR |......| MAR |......| MAR |......| MAR |......| MAR |
          +-----+      +-----+      +-----+      +-----+      +-----+
                `.        :           ,'  `.          :           ,'
                 `.       :         ,'     `.         :         ,'
                  `.      :       ,'        `.        :       ,'
                   `.     :     ,'            `.      :     ,'
                    v     v    v                v     v    v
                    |     |    |                |     |    |
                    +----------+     Move       +----------+
                    | Terminal |  ==========>   | Terminal |
                    +----------+                +----------+

   When Terminal move around in the wireless environment, it may change
   multiple connections timely.For example, radio x and xi are the same
   type wireless link like LTE, and radio v is always connected like
   WiMAX, radio y is WLAN and radio z is TDS-CDMA. when terminal make a
   movement, wireless connections will also changes, the routing and
   mobility management would better change accordingly.

   Different service may act independently when terminal has multiple
   connections.  From the service provider point of view, they don't
   mandate that the application must handover to the second interface
   when it just start up.  Some services may keep original connection,
   and others may handover to the second interface.  This kind of
   handover could happen both initiated by network or terminal itself.
   On this purpose, operator normally specify some policy accordingly,
   GMMP could be used for transmiting this policy between AP and
   terminal.

3.  Reference Model

   Assuming the name of protocol between terminal and access point is
   GMMP which would work in the various kind of wireless connections
   such as WCDMA, LTE, WiFi, and TD-SCDMA et al.  After the coding of
   each command for connections, mobility, and configuration, network or
   terminal could control each connection and mobility management based
   on a common language like the figure below.

                  +------+------+------+------+------+-------+
                  |              GMMP Protocol               |

                  +------+------+------+------+------+-------+
                  | Various Kinds of MAC layer and Protocol  |
                  +------+------+------+------+------+-------+
                  |   WCDMA |   LTE    |   WiFi   |  TDSCDMA |
                  +------+------+------+------+------+-------+

   Each wireless technology essentially has independent control command
   and protocol, but when network would like to control all wireless
   connection based on a generic command, it has to some changes in
   driver level.

4.  Protocol Overview

   GMMP could use UDP/TCP/SCTP as its transport protocol.  GMMP messages
   from a client to a server are sent to the 'GMMP server' port (TBD),
   and GMMP messages from a server to a client are sent to the 'GMMP
   client' port (TBD).

                       Figure 1: GMMP message header

   GMMP V.:

      A 4 bit field which contains the version of GMMP used in this
      packet.  The value for this specification is zero (0).

   Type:

      A 4 bit field which specifies the payload type that follows the
      UDP header.

   GMMP message defines the following message type:

   GMMPCONNECT(1)    A mobile node send a connection message to a AP.

   GMMPDISCONNECT(2) A mobile node send a disconnection message to a AP.

   GMMPACK(3)        A mobile node send a acknowledge message to a AP.

   GMMPCONFIG(4)     A AP send a configuration message to a mobile node.

   GMMPDECLINE(5)    A AP send a decline message to a mobile node

   Length:

      A 8 bit field containing the length of the GMMP transport header
      in 4 byte words (Similar to IP header length).  This length
      includes the optional headers.

Internet-Draft                    GMMP                      October 2008


   Flags:

      A set of reserved bits for future flags in the GMMP header.  All
      implementations complying with this protocol MUST set to zero any
      bits that are reserved in the version of the protocol supported by
      that implementation.  Receivers MUST ignore all bits not defined
      for the version of the protocol they support.

   Identification:

      A 64-bit number, constructed by the sender, used for protecting
      against replay attacks of GMMP messages.

   The GMMP client broadcasts GMMPCONNECT and GMMPDISCONNECT messages,
   unless the client knows the address of a GMMP server.  The client
   unicasts GMMPACK messages to the server.

   When the GMMP client knows the address of a GMMP server, the client
   may use that address in the GMMPCONNECT or GMMPDISCONNECT rather than
   the IP broadcast address.  If the client receives no response to GMMP
   messages sent to the IP address of a known GMMP server, the GMMP
   client reverts to using the IP broadcast address.

   The mobile node broadcasts a GMMPCONNECT message on its local
   physical subnet.  The GMMPCONNECT message MAY include options that
   suggest values for the network authentication and address assignment.
   GMMP relay agents may pass the message on to GMMP servers not on the
   same physical subnet.

   Each server may respond with a GMMPCONFIG message that includes an
   available network information such as address, security challenges et
   al.Each server could also respond with a GMMPDECLINE message which
   means server doesn't allow this action.

   After receiving the GMMPCONFIG or GMMPDECLINE message.  The client
   unicasts GMMPACK messages to the server.

4.1.  GMMPCONNECT message

   A mobile node send a connection message to a AP.

   A mobile node send this message to a AP when it decide to connect to
   this wireless link in the case of mobile node decide handover.

4.2.  GMMPDISCONNECT message

6.  Usage Scenario

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol [NETLMM-MM-MAG] has specify an interface
   between mobile node and MAG, but it doesn't specify any protocol for
   usage.  Normally, it will depends on layer 2 specific message.
   Another issue for Proxy Mobile IPv6, regarding to mobile initiate
   mobility management, the trigger for sending proxy binding update
   message could be various kind of message such as DHCP, Router
   solicitaion or acknowledgement message.  When the mobile node has
   multiple heterogenerous wireless connections, such various kind of
   message will be not suitable.

   GMMP could be used between MAG and MN in Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol
   which will be used for mobility trigger, IP address configuration,
   policy configuration et al.

7.  Security Considerations

   The protocol between terminal and wireless access point could be
   protected by wirless protection mechanism since most of wireless
   communication is based on point to point connections, in the case of
   shared link wireless connection, layer 2 or layer 3 based security
   mechanism should be adopted.
