   their User Agents (UA).  It also provides the signaling for users to
   perform searches of available files and monitor changes in those
   files.  Additionally, this memo describes the signaling used to
   access a file.  These methods can be used in (but are not limited to)
   SIP peer-to-peer systems based on centralized, semi-centralized or
   fully distributed architectures.

Internet-Draft              SIP File Sharing               November 2007


1.  Introduction

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] is a text-based
   protocol for initiating and managing communication sessions.  The
   protocol is extended by the SIP-events framework [RFC3265] to provide
   a mechanism whereby a user can subscribe to state changes of
   resources and get notifications when the state of the resource
   changes.  SIP also provides a publication mechanism [RFC3903] that
   allows a user to supply resource metadata related to the state and
   changes in the state of such resource.  A 'file' event package
   [I-D.garcia-sipping-file-event-package] is used to allow SIP User
   Agents to publish, subscribe, and get notifications of the
   availability of files, such as images, video files, audio files, etc.
   The 'file' event package reuses the XML Data Format for descibing
   files [I-D.garcia-app-area-file-data-format].  All these building
   blocks can be easily combined to provide a mechanism whereby users
   can supply the availability of files stored in their user agents.
   The mechanism can also provide a directory search within a publishing
   community, so that members of the community can search for the
   availability of files that have been made available by other members
   of the same community, and then further download selected files.

   Think for example of a user, Alice, who wants to make a set of image
   files available to members of her family.  She sets up a SIP peer-to-
   peer network with her family, and publishes the file metadata
   describing her available files.  The file metadata is stored in the
   peer nodes, for example, in each Alice's family user agents.  Then,
   Bob, a member of the same SIP peer-to-peer network, wants to acquire
   those pictures, tagged with a keyword 'vacation'.  He defines the
   search criteria; his SIP UA creates an appropriate filter and sets up
   a short subscription by sending it to the SIP peer-to-peer network.
   Then he receives notifications from the different peer nodes,
   containing a metadata describing the searched files.

   In another scenario, a centralized server can be used to aggregate
   all the state file metadata.  This might be useful in cases where
   several instances of the same file are available at different SIP
   user agents.  The server will act as a state agent (defined in RFC
   3265 [RFC3265]) and Event State Compositor (ESC) (defined in RFC 3903
   [RFC3903]).  The aggregation the server performs relieves the
   endpoints from doing the aggregation itself, so this is an
   interesting scenario in deployments that involve endpoints with
   limited processing capability and network bandwidth.

   A hybrid scenario is also possible, where, for example, User Agents
   act as secondary nodes (ordinary peers) in a SIP peer-to-peer
   network.  ESCs are primary nodes (super peers).  In this scenario,
   publication of file metadata and search operations takes place



Garcia-Martin, et al.     Expires May 19, 2008                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft              SIP File Sharing               November 2007


   between the secondary and the primary nodes.  The primary nodes keep
   the state consistent among themselves proactively according to a
   well-defined Distributed Hash Table (DHT) algorithm (e.g.  Chord), or
   alternatively, distribute the search request among themselves
   reactively when a file is needed.

   This memo describes a framework where SIP is used for advertising and
   searching for shared files.  The framework defines the signaling used
   for users to signal the availability of files stored in their User
   Agents (UA).  It also describes the signaling used for users to
   perform searches of available files and monitor changes in existing
   files.  Additionally, signaling used to download a file from a remote
   UA is provided.  These methods can be used in (but are not limited
   to) SIP peer-to-peer systems based on centralized, semi-centralized
   or fully distributed architectures.  While other protocols and
   mechanisms can be used to achieve similar purposes, it is a
   beneficial to provide the means to use SIP in order to minimize the
   protocol implementation support, especially in endpoints with limited
   resources.


2.  Definitions and Document Conventions

   In addition to the definitions of RFC 3265 [RFC3265], and RFC 3903
   [RFC3903], this document introduces the following new terms:

   Community:  A collection of loosely coupled SIP user agents that
      agree to share files among members of the community.  A community
      can be composed of, e.g., an enterprise, a group of friends,
      family members, or members of a club.  The community concept
      implies that there are only duly authenticated and authorized
      users who can access files.
   File metadata:  A set of properties describing a file.  The file
      metadata can include the hash of the file, its name, creation
      date, Uniform Resource Name (URN), Uniform Resource Identifier
      (URI), and other relevant information.
   File descriptor:  A subset of the file metadata that uniquely
      identifies the file.
   File directory:  A device storing the file descriptors of a set of
      files; also called ESC in this document.
   Search operation:  Signalling issued by a user to get information of
      the available files and its associated metadata.  Typically search
      operations are delimited with search filters.
   Search filter:  A set of properties used in search operations to set
      the limits of the search, based on user's input.  A search filter
      can consist of, e.g., a file name, file type, a files description,
      etc.

   File transfer operation:  An operation whereby a UA downloads a file
      from a remote UA.

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and indicate requirement levels for
   compliant implementations.


3.  Use Cases

   This section describes a number of use cases that are addressed later
   in this document.  The use cases are just examples, and do not intend
   to limit the applicability of the file sharing framework.

3.1.  File Publication

   Alice is on holiday in Monaco.  While visiting the Casino, she sees a
   famous painting which she takes a picture of with her camera phone.
   After taking the photo, she tags it with the following tags: Alice,
   Holiday, Monaco, Painting, Casino.  These tags are there to help her
   and her friends to locate the picture later.

   Alice knows that her friends are also interested in art, so she wants
   to make this picture available for anyone to download.  Alice selects
   the picture of the painting, along with some other pictures she took
   later that day, in the picture browser application and selects the
   publish option to make the picture available for others to see.  Once
   the selection of shared files is done, the SIP UA publishes the
   availability of those pictures towards an Event State Compositor
   (ESC).  The actual files are not transmitted until someone requests
   them.

   File publication is further discussed in Section 4.1.1.

3.2.  File Search

   While talking with Charlie on the phone, Bob learns that Alice is
   currently on vacation in Monaco.  Bob knows that Alice likes to take
   photos and share them with her friends, so he opens up his search
   application and types in a few keywords: 'Alice' and 'Monaco'.  Once
   Bob hits the search button, his SIP UA sends the search message to
   the ESC.  After a while, the ESC sends the search results back to
   Bob's SIP UA in a series of notifications.  Now Bob can see the names
   of all pictures Alice has taken when she was in Monaco.  Bob's
   application may also download and display thumbnails of the pictures.
   Bob also finds a couple of pictures taken by Alice's friend, Eve,



Garcia-Martin, et al.     Expires May 19, 2008                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft              SIP File Sharing               November 2007


   which have been tagged with the tags: 'Alice' and 'Monaco'.

   Dave is a student of art.  On the bus he meets his friend Eve. While
   chatting, Eve tells about the painting she has seen on her recent
   visit in Monaco.  Dave wonders if there are some pictures of it, and
   enters the keywords 'Monaco' and 'Painting' into the application on
   his mobile phone.  Dave hits the search button, and his SIP UA sends
   the search message to the ESC.  After a while, the ESC sends the
   search results back to his SIP UA in a series of notifications.  The
   application displays a list of files matching the keywords, including
   the pictures Alice and other visitors have taken.  To his surprise,
   Dave also finds a video stream presenting the art museums of Monaco.

   Search operations are further discussed in Section 5.

3.3.  File Directory Through Presence Information

   Charlie is a good friend of Alice.  Therefore he is interested to
   know about new pictures that Alice publishes.  In this case he can
   just subscribe to Alice's presence information.  Attached with
   conventional the presence information, he receives the information
   about the files Alice is hosting in her UAs.

   Instead of periodical searching for files tagged with Alice's name,
   Charlie can just subscribe to Alice's presence information, and get
   notification every time Alice adds new pictures to her shared files.

   The same file browsing functionality can be used also in multi-user
   chat between Alice, Charlie, Eve, and Bob. In the chat application,
   Bob sees names of every participant in the user list displayed on his
   screen.  When clicking anyone's name, he gets list of files that the
   selected participant is hosting attached with the conventional
   presence information of this person.

   This document does not specify implementation of the file browsing
   via presence information.  A solution is described in the Internet-
   Draft 'File Descriptions Extension to the PIDF'
   [I-D.garcia-sipping-file-desc-pidf].

   File directory through presence information is further discussed in
   Section 6.

3.4.  File Download

   Once a Bob has found an interesting file called 'Alice and Eve at the
   Casino', e.g., by using the search functionality or by browsing
   Alice's presence information for files, he wants to display that
   picture on his device.  To initiate the download, Bob selects the



Garcia-Martin, et al.     Expires May 19, 2008                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft              SIP File Sharing               November 2007


   picture and hits the download button.  Bob's SIP UA sends a download
   request to Alice's SIP UA.  Alice's terminal will automatically
   approve the request and their UAs will establish a file transfer
   session.  After the file transfer, Bob is presented with a dialog of
   file transfer completion, and asked if he wants to open the file
   immediately in the picture viewer.

   Section 7 provides further discussion on downloading files.


4.  Publication of File Metadata

   Publication of File Metadata is based on the PUBLISH method specified
   in RFC 3903 [RFC3903].  We proposed two variants of publication,
   depending on whether the publication supports search operations or
   directory operations.  To support the former, publication is done
   with the 'file' event package [I-D.garcia-sipping-file-event-package]
   and the 'file-metadata' XML format
   [I-D.garcia-app-area-file-data-format].  To support the later, the
   Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) [RFC3863] is extended to
   provide a description of available files together with the presence
   information of the presentity.

4.1.  File Metadata Publication in Support of Search Operations

4.1.1.  Initial File Metadata Publication

   Initial file metadata publication is perfomed to publish metadata
   about the availability of one or more files to the ESC.  Figure 1
   presents the signaling flow required for an Event Publishing Agent
   (EPA) to publish the availability of one or more files towards the
   Event State Compositor (ESC).

                EPA                                     ESC
                 |                                       |
                 |  SIP/2.0 PUBLISH                      |
                 |  Event: file                          |
                 |  (file-metadata document)             |
                 | ------------------------------------> |
                 |                                       |
                 |  200 OK SIP/2.0                       |
                 |  SIP-ETag: x                          |

                 |                                       |

         Figure 1: Signaling flow for publication of file metadata

   The EPA performs the initial file metadata publication by sending a

Internet-Draft              SIP File Sharing               November 2007


   PUBLISH [RFC3903] request to the ESC.  The PUBLISH request contains a
   full 'file-metadata' document that contains metadata about one or
   more files available at the EPA.  The 'file-metadata' document is
   defined in the XML data format for describing files
   [I-D.garcia-app-area-file-data-format].  Each file is described using
   a set of invariant file metadata and a set of file metadata specific
   to each instance of the file, given in the <identity> and <instance>
   child elements of the <file> element.

   The invariant file metadata contains the following attributes: the
   Uniform Resource Name (URN), the MIME type (e.g., image/jpeg), the
   size and the SHA-1 hash of the file.  For each identical copy of the
   file, the instance-specific metadata contains any of: the SIP URI of
   the file, the file name, a short description, a set of keywords
   describing the file, the file creation date, the file modification
   date, the file read date, a link to an icon, and other file metadata
   that is associated to the file.  Additionally the instance-specific
   metadata contains the SIP AOR (e.g.  URI) and GRUU of the user's
   endpoint hosting the file.

   The PUBLISH request is routed to the ESC.  The ESC sends a 200 OK
   response that, according to RFC 3903 [RFC3903], includes a SIP-ETag
   header field that contains the entity-tag allocated to the resource.
   The EPA stores this entity-tag for future references to the
   publication.

      Note that the actual file is not transmitted at any point to the
      ESC: only the metadata associated with the file is transmitted.

4.1.2.  Publication of Modified File Metadata

   Whenever a file is modified or new files are added or deleted from
   the endpoint, the EPA refreshes the previous publication by sending a
   new PUBLISH request, as shown in Figure 2.  This publication carries
   a partial 'file-metadata' document that contains a number of XML
   patch operations that add, remove, or replace XML elements towards
   the last published 'file-metadata' document.

      A file modification occurs, e.g., when an image file is edited to
      suppress red eyes, an audio file is edited to suppress silence or
      apply some noise filter, or when some audio/music stream provided
      by the UE changes its bitrate.  Any kind of modification to the
      file owned by the UE implies a change in the metadata.

   RFC 3903 [RFC3903] contains provisions to allow the ESC to
   distinguish an initial publication from a refreshment-based one with
   the aid of the entity tags and the SIP-ETag and SIP-If-Match header
   fields.  The SIP-Etags in conjunction with the 'version' attribute of

   the root element of the 'file' document provide the means to
   synchronize versions.

                 |                                       |
                 |  200 OK SIP/2.0                       |
                 |  SIP-ETag: y                          |
                 | <------------------------------------ |

    Figure 2: Signaling flow for publication of modified file metadata

   If a resouce becomes unavailable at the EPA, e.g., as a result of a
   file deletion, the file metadata publication contains a partial
   'file-metadata' document that describes the file to be removed.

4.1.3.  Actions Performed by the ESC

   When the ESC receives initial or updated publications, the ESC
   typically locally stores the published metadata, but in some cases,
   depending on the usage scenario, storage of metadata will take place
   in other nodes, for example, in other primary nodes which are members
   of a DHT.

   The ESC may act as a primary node in an overlay SIP P2P network.
   Thus, upon reception of a publication from one of its secondary
   nodes, the primary node may need to publish or update the metadata in
   the overlay P2PSIP network.  This step heavily depends on the chosen
   peer-to-peer algorithm.  For example, if the P2PSIP distribution
   algorithm is based on flooding, the primary node may not need to
   contact any other primary node, but just wait for search queries from
   them.  However, if the overlay is based on a Distributed Hash Table
   (DHT) based algorithm, then the primary node may need to update file
   metadata and store it in the appropriate node.  The actual mechanism
   to update file metadata is dependent on the specific algorithm and
   out of scope of this memo.

4.2.  File Metadata Publication in Support of Directory Operations

   Publication of file metadata in support of directory operations is
   done by extending the presence information data format (PIDF).  PIDF
   is commonly used in publications and notifications of presence

   information.  The publisher composes a PIDF [RFC3863] document
   according to the Presence Data Model [RFC4479].  The <device> element
   of the data model contains the file metadata.  This is further
   described in a the Internet-Draft 'File Descriptions Extension to the
   PIDF' [I-D.garcia-sipping-file-desc-pidf].

   Publication of presence information contains a number of mechanisms
   that complement publication operations, for example, partial
   publication, presence authorization rules, etc., are always at the
   presentity's disposal.

   Figure 3: Signaling flow for publication of presence information that
                          includes file metadata

   Publication of modified file metadata in the PIDF is done similarly
   to the publication of modified file metadata (see Section 4.1.2), but
   the event package is set to presence.


5.  Search Operation

   The search of shared files is implemented with the SIP event
   framework defined in RFC 3265 [RFC3265] in conjunction with the
   'file' event package [I-D.garcia-sipping-file-event-package] and a
   filter document [RFC4661].

   The signaling flow for a search operation is shown in Figure 4.

5.1.  Sending a Search Request

   To search for a particular file, the subscriber first builds a filter
   containing the data of the searched file.  The filter can contain,
   for example, keywords, file names, types of files, etc.  The filter
   conforms to the XML format for filters [RFC4661].  Then the
   subscriber attaches the filter to a SUBSCRIBE request for the 'file'
   event package.  The subscription duration will be short, typically on
   the order of a few minutes.  This subscription time provides enough
   time for a primary node in a SIP peer-to-peer network to propagate
   the search within the overlay network and get responses before the



Garcia-Martin, et al.     Expires May 19, 2008                 [Page 11]

Internet-Draft              SIP File Sharing               November 2007


   subscription expires.  Eventually, the SUBSCRIBE request is sent to a
   notifier (either a peer or an ESC) that will provide one or more
   NOTIFY requests including a 'file-metadata' document according to the
   filtered content.

5.2.  Reporting Search Results

   After receiving the SUBSCRIBE request and acknowledging it with a 200
   (OK) response, the notifier sends a NOTIFY request to the subscriber.
   This request may contain a first collection of file metadata about
   the searched file, if such information is already available in the
   ESC, in a full 'file-metadata' document.  Information may be
   available immediately in case there is matching metadata stored in
   the ESC, due to push operations according to the peer-to-peer
   algorithm, or due to cached information from previous searches.  In
   many cases, however, this NOTIFY request does not contain a 'file-
   metadata' document about the searched file, and it is sent just
   because the protocol (RFC 3265 [RFC3265]) requires an immediate
   NOTIFY after each successful SUBSCRIBE request.  The NOTIFY request
   is acknowledged with a 200 (OK) response.

   The ESC may, depending on algorithm, invoke a search for additional
   files, whose metadata is stored in other ESCs (see section 4.3).  Due
   to this propagated search, additional matching file descriptors may
   become known.  New matching file descriptors may also become known as
   a result of PUBLISH requests received by the ESC within the duration
   of the subscription.

   To report matching files, the ESC sends NOTIFY requests to the
   subscriber.  The body of the initial NOTIFY contains follows the
   procedures of the 'file' event package
   [I-D.garcia-sipping-file-event-package] and contains a full 'file-
   metadata' document that is formatted according to the XML Data Format
   for describing files [I-D.garcia-app-area-file-data-format].  The
   'file-metadata' document contains metadata about several files that
   matched the search criteria, including the file name, size, type,
   icon, hash, SIP URI and UE (GRUU) of the users (and UAs) where the
   file is available, etc.  In some cases, the file metadata that
   describes a given file will provide more than one location of the
   file.  This will typically be the case when a popular file is
   available in several endpoints.  Then the 'file-metadata' document
   supplied with the NOTIFY request contains more than one <instance>
   child element in a given <file>element.  It may also be necessary to
   divide a NOTIFY request into several smaller due to the user's
   preferences (rate of notifications, bandwidth consumption, and event
   throttling).  NOTIFY requests are acknowledged with 200 (OK)
   responses.

Internet-Draft              SIP File Sharing               November 2007


   The initial NOTIFY request contains a full 'file-metadata' document.
   Once the notifier acquires more metadata, it sends partial 'file-
   metadata' documents with additions, replacements, or removals.  Upon
   reception of a new partial 'file-metadata' document, the subscriber
   composes a full 'file-metadata' document, based on the existing
   previous version plus the partial notification.  Then, the subscriber
   UA has the new full 'file-metadata' document at his disposal, so it
   can, e.g., display the metadata sequentially to the user, as soon as
   new results are received.

5.3.  Propagating Searches

   In many cases, such as in P2P systems, the metadata is distributed in
   several ESCs.  We consider two special cases:

   1.  In a flooding based architecture, several or all ESCs need to be
       queried in order to find the matching file.  A given ESC is only
       aware of file that have been published into its local database.
   2.  In a DHT based architecture, such as Chord, a specific ESC is
       responsible for a specific set of metadata.

   In both cases, the ESC/ESCs containing the required file metadata may
   be another ESC than the one receiving the SUBSCRIBE request.

5.3.1.  Searching Based on Flooding

   In a flooding based search, the SUBSCRIBE request is first processed
   by the local ESC itself, and then distributed to all ESCs in the
   system.  The distribution is, however, limited by the value of the
   Max-Forwards header field.  An ESC receiving the SUBSCRIBE request
   consults its local database to find matching file descriptors and it
   replies with a NOTIFY request that may contain a 'file-metadata'
   document if matching file descriptors are found locally.  The ESC
   also acts as an URI-list server [RFC4662] where the URI-list is
   locally stored.  It then forwards a SUBSCRIBE request with the same
   filter document to each of the ESCs stored in its neighbor table,
   providing that the Max-Forwards header field is still positive and
   provided that the ESC has not yet processed the same request.  The
   generation and maintenance of the neighbor table is out of scope of
   this memo.

   The ESC will receive NOTIFY requests from other neighbor nodes, each
   of the requests containing a different 'file-metadata' document.  The
   ESC will aggregates and composes a single 'file-metadata' document,
   and sends partial notifications to the subscriber, according to the
   rate of notifications.

   The subscriber is getting periodic partial notifications, each one

Internet-Draft              SIP File Sharing               November 2007


   adding new files or new instances of existing files to the list of
   file descriptors.

5.3.2.  Searching Based on Distributed Hash Tables (DHT)

   In a DHT based system, a single node (a notifier) is responsible for
   the metadata related to a given search key (the file).  When
   searching a file, the hash of the file is the key in the DHT.  An ESC
   receiving a SUBSCRIBE request consults its routing table (finger
   table in Chord) to locate the notifier whose key is the closest one
   to the search key, and forwards the SUBSCRIBE request to that ESC.
   Eventually the SUBSCRIBE request reaches the node responsible for the
   given search key.  The definition of 'closest' is depending on the
   actual DHT used.

5.4.  Terminating a Search Request

   When the last results are made available, or when the search
   operation expires, the server sends a last NOTIFY request to the
   user, containing the latest available results in a 'file-metadata'
   document (if any), and setting the Subscription-State header field to
   "terminated" to indicate the end of the search operation, as per
   procedures of RFC 3265 [RFC3265].

   The user can also cancel the search operation by sending a re-
   SUBSCRIBE request that contains a Expires header field set to zero,
   according also to the procedures of RFC 3265 [RFC3265].

5.5.  Example of a Search Filter

   Figure 4 provides the signaling flow for a search operation.  The
   SUBSCRIBE request contains a filter body, formatted according to the
   filter data format [RFC4661].  Figure 5 shows an example of the
   SUBSCRIBE request carrying a filter.  The filter selects a few XML
   elements of a file that contains the string "vacation" in a <keyword>
   element.

6.  Directory Operations Through Presence Information

   Directory operations through presence information allows an
   authorized watcher of presence information to be updated on the list
   available files stored at a presentity's device.  In Figure 6, the
   watcher does a regular subscription to the presentity's presence
   information, either directly between the two endpoints, or with the
   support of a Presence Agent (PA).  Once the subscription is duly
   authorized, the subscriber receives updated presence information in
   NOTIFY requests.  The request contains a PIDF document structured
   according to the presence data model.  The 'device' part of the data
   model contains a list of available files that the presentity provides
   at the subscriber's disposal.

   All the presence mechanisms are available also in directory
   operations.  For example, partial notifications, presence
   authorization rules, filters, etc., are applicable.

7.  Downloading a file

   Once the search operation is complete, the user can select whether to
   do any further operation on a given file, and if so, on which
   instance to operate.  A file can be downloaded, for example, by
   setting up an MSRP session towards the user's SIP URI, and providing
   a file description in the SDP offer.  This mechanism is described in
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-file-transfer-mech].  In this case, the SIP INVITE
   request is addressed (Request-URI) to the URI contained in a <user-
   gruu> (preferred option) or <user-uri> elements of the chosen
   <identity> for that <file>.  The file requester creates an SDP
   description of an MSRP session that contains the SDP file description
   extensions to describe the file.  If the hash of the file is
   available, it is RECOMMENDED to include it, as it uniquely identifies
   the file.

   In other cases, there can be a URN or URI that describes the file in
   the <urn> or <uri> elements of that <file>.  The mechanism to
   retrieve or receive service from the file is dependent on the type of
   URI scheme.  For example, an HTTP URI requires an HTTP GET request to
   retrieve the file.  Similarly FTP URIs require the establishment of
   an FTP session.
