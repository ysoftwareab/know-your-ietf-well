     Micro-loop prevention by introducing a local convergence delay
                    draft-ietf-rtgwg-uloop-delay-06

Abstract

   This document describes a mechanism for link-state routing protocols
   to prevent local transient forwarding loops in case of link failure.
   This mechanism proposes a two-step convergence by introducing a delay
   between the convergence of the node adjacent to the topology change
   and the network wide convergence.

   As this mechanism delays the IGP convergence it may only be used for
   planned maintenance or when fast reroute protects the traffic between
   the link failure time and the IGP convergence.

   The proposed mechanism is limited to the link down event in order to
   keep the mechanism simple.

   Simulations using real network topologies have been performed and
   show that local loops are a significant portion (>50%) of the total
   forwarding loops.

1.  Introduction

   Micro-forwarding loops and some potential solutions are well
   described in [RFC5715].  This document describes a simple targeted
   mechanism that prevents micro-loops that are local to the failure.
   Based on network analysis, local failure make up a significant
   portion of the micro-forwarding loops.  A simple and easily
   deployable solution for these local micro-loops is critical because
   these local loops cause some traffic loss after a fast-reroute
   alternate has been used (see Section 2.1).

   Consider the case in Figure 1 where S does not have an LFA to protect
   its traffic to D.  That means that all non-D neighbors of S on the
   topology will send to S any traffic destined to D if a neighbor did
   not, then that neighbor would be loop-free.  Regardless of the
   advanced fast-reroute (FRR) technique used, when S converges to the
   new topology, it will send its traffic to a neighbor that was not
   loop-free and thus cause a local micro-loop.  The deployment of
   advanced fast-reroute techniques motivates this simple router-local
   mechanism to solve this targeted problem.  This solution can be work
   with the various techniques described in [RFC5715].

        Figure 1

   When S-D fails, a transient forwarding loop may appear between S and
   B if S updates its forwarding entry to D before B.

2.  Transient forwarding loops side effects

   Even if they are very limited in duration, transient forwarding loops
   may cause high damages for a network.

        Figure 2 - RSVP-TE FRR case

   In the Figure 2, we consider an IP/LDP routed network.  An RSVP-TE
   tunnel T, provisioned on C and terminating on B, is used to protect
   the traffic against C-B link failure (IGP shortcut is activated on
   C).  The primary path of T is C->B and FRR is activated on T
   providing an FRR bypass or detour using path C->E->A->B.  On the
   router C, the nexthop to D is the tunnel T thanks to the IGP
   shortcut.  When C-B link fails:

   1.  C detects the failure, and updates the tunnel path using
       preprogrammed FRR path, the traffic path from S to D becomes:
       S->E->C->E->A->B->A->D.

   2.  In parallel, on router C, both the IGP convergence and the TE
       tunnel convergence (tunnel path recomputation) are occurring:

       *  The Tunnel T path is recomputed and now uses C->E->A->B.

       *  The IGP path to D is recomputed and now uses C->E->A->D.

   3.  On C, the tail-end of the TE tunnel (router B) is no more on the
       shortest-path tree (SPT) to D, so C does not encapsulate anymore
       the traffic to D using the tunnel T and updates its forwarding
       entry to D using the nexthop E.

   If C updates its forwarding entry to D before router E, there would
   be a transient forwarding loop between C and E until E has converged.

                    Route computation event time scale

   The issue described here is completely independent of the fast-
   reroute mechanism involved (TE FRR, LFA/rLFA, MRT ...) when the
   primary path uses hop-by-hop routing.  The protection enabled by
   fast-reroute is working perfectly, but ensures a protection, by
   definition, only until the PLR has converged.  When implementing FRR,
   a service provider wants to guarantee a very limited loss of
   connectivity time.  The previous example shows that the benefit of
   FRR may be completely lost due to a transient forwarding loop
   appearing when PLR has converged.  Delaying FIB updates after the IGP
   convergence may allow to keep the fast-reroute path until the
   neighbors have converged and preserves the customer traffic.

         Figure 3

   In the figure above, as presented in Section 1, when the link S-D
   fails, a transient forwarding loop may appear between S and B for
   destination D.  The traffic on the S-B link will constantly increase
   due to the looping traffic to D.  Depending on the TTL of the
   packets, the traffic rate destined to D, and the bandwidth of the
   link, the S-B link may become congested in a few hundreds of
   milliseconds and will stay congested until the loop is eliminated.

   The congestion introduced by transient forwarding loops is
   problematic as it can affect traffic that is not directly affected by
   the failing network component.  In our example, the congestion of the
   S-B link will impact some customer traffic that is not directly
   affected by the failure: e.g.  A to B, F to B, E to B.  Class of

   service may mitigate the congestion for some traffic.  However, some
   traffic not directly affected by the failure will still be dropped as
   a router is not able to distinguish the looping traffic from the
   normally forwarded traffic.

3.  Overview of the solution

   This document defines a two-step convergence initiated by the router
   detecting a failure and advertising the topological changes in the
   IGP.  This introduces a delay between the convergence of the local
   router and the network wide convergence.

   The proposed solution is limited to local link down events in order
   to keep the solution simple.

   This ordered convergence, is similar to the ordered FIB proposed
   defined in [RFC6976], but it is limited to only a "one hop" distance.
   As a consequence, it is simpler and becomes a local only feature that
   does not require interoperability.  This benefit comes at the expense
   of eliminating transient forwarding loops involving the local router.
   The proposed mechanism also reuses some concepts described in
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-microloop-analysis].

4.  Specification

4.1.  Definitions

   This document will refer to the following existing IGP timers:

   o  LSP_GEN_TIMER: The delay used to batch multiple local events in
      one single local LSP/LSA update.  It is often associated with a
      damping mechanism to slow down reactions by incrementing the timer
      when multiple consecutive events are detected.

   o  SPF_DELAY: The delay between the first IGP event triggering a new
      routing table computation and the start of that routing table
      computation.  It is often associated with a damping mechanism to
      slow down reactions by incrementing the timer when the IGP becomes
      unstable.  As an example, [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-backoff-algo] defines a
      standard SPF delay algorithm.

   This document introduces the following new timer:

   o  ULOOP_DELAY_DOWN_TIMER: used to slow down the local node
      convergence in case of link down events.

4.2.  Current IGP reactions

   Upon a change of the status of an adjacency/link, the existing
   behavior of the router advertising the event is the following:

   1.  The Up/Down event is notified to the IGP.

   2.  The IGP processes the notification and postpones the reaction for
       LSP_GEN_TIMER msec.

   3.  Upon LSP_GEN_TIMER expiration, the IGP updates its LSP/LSA and
       floods it.

   4.  The SPF computation is scheduled in SPF_DELAY msec.

   5.  Upon SPF_DELAY timer expiration, the SPF is computed, then the
       RIB and FIB are updated.

4.3.  Local events

   The mechanism described in this document assumes that there has been
   a single link failure as seen by the IGP area/level.  If this
   assumption is violated (e.g. multiple links or nodes failed), then
   standard IP convergence MUST be applied (as described in
   Section 4.2).

   To determine if the mechanism can be applicable or not, an
   implementation SHOULD implement logic to correlate the protocol
   messages (LSP/LSA) received during the SPF scheduling period in order
   to determine the topology changes that occured.  This is necessary as
   multiple protocol messages may describe the same topology change and
   a single protocol message may describe multiple topology changes.  As
   a consequence, determining a particular topology change MUST be
   independent of the order of reception of those protocol messages.
   How the logic works is left to the implementation.

   Using this logic, if an implementation determines that the associated
   topology change is a single local link failure, then the router MAY
   use the mechanism described in this document, otherwise the standard
   IP convergence MUST be used.

   Example:

          +--- E ----+--------+
          |          |        |
   A ---- B -------- C ------ D

   Let router B be the computing router when the link B-C fails.  B
   updates its local LSP/LSA describing the link B->C as down, C does
   the same, and both start flooding their updated LSP/LSAs.  During the
   SPF_DELAY period, B and C learn all the LSPs/LSAs to consider.  B
   sees that C is flooding an advertisement that indicates that a link
   is down, and B is the other end of that link.  B determines that B
   and C are describing the same single event.  Since B receives no
   other changes, B can determine that this is a local link failure and
   may decide to activate the mechanism described in this document.

4.4.  Local delay for link down

   Upon an adjacency/link down event, this document introduces a change
   in step 5 (Section 4.2) in order to delay the local convergence
   compared to the network wide convergence.  The new step 5 is
   described below:

      5.  Upon SPF_DELAY timer expiration, the SPF is computed.  If the
      condition of a single local link-down event has been met, then an
      update of the RIB and the FIB SHOULD be delayed for
      ULOOP_DELAY_DOWN_TIMER msecs.  Otherwise, the RIB and FIB SHOULD
      be updated immediately.

   If a new convergence occurs while ULOOP_DELAY_DOWN_TIMER is running,
   ULOOP_DELAY_DOWN_TIMER is stopped and the RIB/FIB SHOULD be updated
   as part of the new convergence event.

   As a result of this addition, routers local to the failure will
   converge slower than remote routers.  Hence it SHOULD only be done
   for a non-urgent convergence, such as for administrative de-
   activation (maintenance) or when the traffic is protected by fast-
   reroute.

5.  Applicability

   As previously stated, this mechanism only avoids the forwarding loops
   on the links between the node local to the failure and its neighbors.
   Forwarding loops may still occur on other links.

5.1.  Applicable case: local loops

        A ------ B ----- E
        |              / |
        |             /  |
    G---D------------C   F        All the links have a metric of 1

   Let us consider the traffic from G to F.  The primary path is
   G->D->C->E->F.  When link C-E fails, if C updates its forwarding
   entry for F before D, a transient loop occurs.  This is sub-optimal
   as C has FRR enabled and it breaks the FRR forwarding while all
   upstream routers are still forwarding the traffic to itself.

   By implementing the mechanism defined in this document on C, when the
   C-E link fails, C delays the update of its forwarding entry to F, in
   order to allow some time for D to converge.  FRR on C keeps
   protecting the traffic during this period.  When the timer expires on
   C, its forwarding entry to F is updated.  There is no transient
   forwarding loop on the link C-D.

5.2.  Non applicable case: remote loops

        A ------ B ----- E --- H
        |                      |
        |                      |
    G---D--------C ------F --- J ---- K

    All the links have a metric of 1 except BE=15

        Figure 6

   Let us consider the traffic from G to K.  The primary path is
   G->D->C->F->J->K.  When the C-F link fails, if C updates its
   forwarding entry to K before D, a transient loop occurs between C and
   D.

   By implementing the mechanism defined in this document on C, when the
   link C-F fails, C delays the update of its forwarding entry to K,
   allowing time for D to converge.  When the timer expires on C, its
   forwarding entry to F is updated.  There is no transient forwarding
   loop between C and D.  However, a transient forwarding loop may still
   occur between D and A.  In this scenario, this mechanism is not
   enough to address all the possible forwarding loops.  However, it
   does not create additional traffic loss.  Besides, in some cases
   -such as when the nodes update their FIB in the following order C, A,
   D, for example because the router A is quicker than D to converge-
   the mechanism may still avoid the forwarding loop that would have
   otherwise occurred.

6.  Simulations

   Simulations have been run on multiple service provider topologies.

                Table 1: Number of Repair/Dst that may loop

   We evaluated the efficiency of the mechanism on eight different
   service provider topologies (different network size, design).  The
   benefit is displayed in the table above.  The benefit is evaluated as
   follows:

   o  We consider a tuple (link A-B, destination D, PLR S, backup
      nexthop N) as a loop if upon link A-B failure, the flow from a
      router S upstream from A (A could be considered as PLR also) to D
      may loop due to convergence time difference between S and one of
      his neighbors N.

   o  We evaluate the number of potential loop tuples in normal
      conditions.

   o  We evaluate the number of potential loop tuples using the same
      topological input but taking into account that S converges after
      N.

   o  The gain is how many loops (both remote and local) we succeed to
      suppress.

   On topology 1, 71% of the transient forwarding loops created by the
   failure of any link are prevented by implementing the local delay.
   The analysis shows that all local loops are prevented and only remote
   loops remain.

7.  Deployment considerations

   Transient forwarding loops have the following drawbacks:

   o  They limit FRR efficiency: even if FRR is activated within 50msec,
      as soon as PLR has converged, the traffic may be affected by a
      transient loop.



Litkowski, et al.       Expires February 9, 2018               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                 uloop-delay                   August 2017


   o  They may impact traffic not directly affected by the failure (due
      to link congestion).

   This local delay proposal is a transient forwarding loop avoidance
   mechanism (like OFIB).  Even if it only addresses local transient
   loops, the efficiency versus complexity comparison of the mechanism
   makes it a good solution.  It is also incrementally deployable with
   incremental benefits, which makes it an attractive option both for
   vendors to implement and service providers to deploy.  Delaying the
   convergence time is not an issue if we consider that the traffic is
   protected during the convergence.

8.  Examples

   We will consider the following figure for the associated examples :

           D
         1 |        F----X
           |    1   |
           A ------ B

           |    1
         1 |
           S

             Figure 7

   The network above is considered to have a convergence time about 1
   second, so ULOOP_DELAY_DOWN_TIMER will be adjusted to this value.  We
   also consider that FRR is running on each node.

8.1.  Local link down

   The table below describes the events and associating timing that
   happens on router C and E when link B-C goes down.  As C detects a
   single local event corresponding to a link down (its LSP + LSP from B
   received), it decides to apply the local delay down behavior and no
   microloop is formed.

                    Route computation event time scale

   Similarly, upon B-C link down event, if LSP/LSA from B is received
   before C detects the link failure, C will apply the route update
   delay if the local detection is part of the same SPF run.

8.2.  Local and remote event

   The table below describes the events and associating timing that
   happens on router C and E when link B-C goes down, in addition F-X
   link will fail in the same time window.  C will not apply the local
   delay because a non local topology change is also received.

8.3.  Aborting local delay

   The table below describes the events and associated timing that
   happens on router C and E when link B-C goes down.  In addition, we
   consider what happens when F-X link fails during local delay of the
   FIB update.  C will first apply the local delay, but when the new
   event happens, it will fall back to the standard convergence
   mechanism without delaying route insertion anymore.  In this example,
   we consider a ULOOP_DELAY_DOWN_TIMER configured to 2 seconds.

9.  Comparison with other solutions

   As stated in Section 3, our solution reuses some concepts already
   introduced by other IETF proposals but tries to find a tradeoff
   between efficiency and simplicity.  This section tries to compare
   behaviors of the solutions.

9.1.  PLSN

   PLSN ([I-D.ietf-rtgwg-microloop-analysis]) describes a mechanism
   where each node in the network tries to avoid transient forwarding
   loops upon a topology change by always keeping traffic on a loop-free
   path for a defined duration (locked path to a safe neighbor).  The
   locked path may be the new primary nexthop, another neighbor, or the
   old primary nexthop depending how the safety condition is satisfied.

Internet-Draft                 uloop-delay                   August 2017


   PLSN does not solve all transient forwarding loops (see
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-microloop-analysis] Section 4 for more details).

   Our solution reuses some concept of PLSN but in a more simple
   fashion:

   o  PLSN has three different behaviors: keep using old nexthop, use
      new primary nexthop if it is safe, or use another safe nexthop,
      while our solution only have one: keep using the current nexthop
      (old primary, or already activated FRR path).

   o  PLSN may cause some damage while using a safe nexthop which is not
      the new primary nexthop in case the new safe nexthop does not
      enough provide enough bandwidth (see [RFC7916]).  Our solution may
      not experience this issue as the service provider may have control
      on the FRR path being used preventing network congestion.

   o  PLSN applies to all nodes in a network (remote or local changes),
      while our mechanism applies only on the nodes connected to the
      topology change.

9.2.  OFIB

   OFIB ([RFC6976]) describes a mechanism where the convergence of the
   network upon a topology change is made ordered to prevent transient
   forwarding loops.  Each router in the network must deduce the failure
   type from the LSA/LSP received and computes/applies a specific FIB
   update timer based on the failure type and its rank in the network
   considering the failure point as root.

   This mechanism allows to solve all the transient forwarding loop in a
   network at the price of introducing complexity in the convergence
   process that may require a strong monitoring by the service provider.

   Our solution reuses the OFIB concept but limits it to the first hop
   that experiences the topology change.  As demonstrated, our proposal
   allows to solve all the local transient forwarding loops that
   represents an high percentage of all the loops.  Moreover limiting
   the mechanism to one hop allows to keep the network-wide convergence
   behavior.

10.  Existing implementations

   At this time, there are three different implementations of this
   mechanism: CISCO IOS-XR, CISCO IOS-XE and Juniper JUNOS.  The three
   implementations have been tested in labs and demonstrated a good
   behavior in term of local micro-loop avoidance.  The feature has also

   been deployed in some live networks.  No side effects have been
   found.

11.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any change in term of IGP security.
   The operation is internal to the router.  The local delay does not
   increase the number of attack vectors as an attacker could only
   trigger this mechanism if he already has be ability to disable or
   enable an IGP link.  The local delay does not increase the negative
   consequences.  If an attacker has the ability to disable or enable an
   IGP link, it can already harm the network by creating instability and
   harm the traffic by creating forwarding packet loss and forwarding
   loss for the traffic crossing that link.

12.  Acknowledgements

   We would like to thanks the authors of [RFC6976] for introducing the
   concept of ordered convergence: Mike Shand, Stewart Bryant, Stefano
   Previdi, and Olivier Bonaventure.

13.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
