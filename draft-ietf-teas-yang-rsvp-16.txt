       A YANG Data Model for Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)
                      draft-ietf-teas-yang-rsvp-16

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG data model for the configuration and
   management of the RSVP protocol.  The YANG data model covers the
   building blocks that may be augmented by other RSVP extension data
   models such as RSVP Traffic-Engineering (RSVP-TE).  It is divided
   into two modules that cover the basic and extended RSVP features.

1.  Introduction

   YANG [RFC6020] and [RFC7950] is a data modeling language that was
   introduced to define the contents of a conceptual data store that
   allows networked devices to be managed using NETCONF [RFC6241].  YANG
   has proved relevant beyond its initial confines, as bindings to other
   interfaces (e.g.  RESTCONF [RFC8040]) and encoding other than XML
   (e.g.  JSON) are being defined.  Furthermore, YANG data models can be
   used as the basis of implementation for other interfaces, such as CLI
   and programmatic APIs.

   This document defines a YANG data model for the configuration and
   management of the RSVP protocol [RFC2205].  The data model is divided

Internet-Draft            RSVP YANG Data Model             February 2021


   into two modules: a base and extended RSVP YANG modules.  The RSVP
   base YANG 'ietf-rsvp' module covers the data that is core to the
   function of the RSVP protocol and MUST be supported by vendors that
   support RSVP protocol [RFC2205].  The RSVP extended 'ietf-rsvp-
   extended' module covers the data that is optional, or provides
   ability to tune RSVP protocol base functionality.  The support for
   RSVP extended module features by vendors is considered optional.

   The RSVP YANG model provides the building blocks needed to allow
   augmentation by other models that extend the RSVP protocol- such as
   using RSVP extensions to signal Label Switched Paths (LSPs) as
   defined in [RFC3209].

   The YANG module(s) defined in this document are compatible with the
   Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) [RFC7950].

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
   [RFC7950].

2.1.  Prefixes in Data Node Names

   In this document, names of data nodes and other data model objects
   are prefixed using the standard prefix associated with the
   corresponding YANG imported modules, as shown in Table 1.

2.2.  Model Tree Diagram

   A full tree diagram of the module(s) defined in this document is
   given in subsequent sections as per the syntax defined in [RFC8340].

3.  Model Overview

   The RSVP YANG module augments the "control-plane-protocol" entry from
   the 'ietf-routing' module defined in [RFC8349].  It also defines the
   identity "rsvp" of base type "rt:routing-protocol" to identify the
   RSVP routing protocol.

   The 'ietf-rsvp' model defines a single instance of the RSVP protocol.
   The top 'rsvp' container encompases data for one such RSVP protocol
   instance.  Multiple instances can be defined as multiple control-
   plane protocols instances as described in [RFC8349].

   The YANG data model defined has the common building blocks for the
   operation of the base RSVP protocol for the session type defined in
   [RFC2205].  The augmentation of this model by other models (e.g. to
   support RSVP Traffic Engineering (TE) extensions for signaling Label
   Switched Paths (LSPs)) are outside the scope of this document and are
   discussed in separate document(s).

3.1.  Module(s) Relationship

   This RSVP YANG data model defined in this document is divided into
   two modules: a base and extended modules.  The RSVP data covered in
   'ietf-rsvp' module are categorized as core to the function of the
   protocol and MUST be supported by vendors claiming the support for
   RSVP protocol [RFC2205].

   The RSVP extended features that are covered in 'ietf-rsvp-extended'
   module are categorized as either optional or providing ability to
   better tune the basic functionality of the RSVP protocol.  The
   support for RSVP extended features by all vendors is considered
   optional.

   The relationship between the base and RSVP extended YANG modules and
   the IETF routing YANG model is shown in Figure 1.

                             protocol modules

3.2.  Core Features

   The RSVP data covered in the 'ietf-rsvp' YANG module provides the
   common building blocks that are required to configure, operate and
   manage the RSVP protocol and MUST be supported by vendors that claim
   the support for base RSVP protocol defined in [RFC2205].

   In addition, the following standard RSVP core features are modeled
   under the 'ietf-rsvp' module:

   o  Basic operational statistics, including protocol messages, packets
      and errors.

   o  Basic RSVP authentication feature as defined in [RFC2747]) using
      string based authentication key.

   o  Basic RSVP Refresh Reduction feature as defined in ([RFC2961]).

   o  Basic RSVP Hellos feature as defined in ([RFC3209])

   o  Basic RSVP Graceful Restart feature as defined in [RFC3473],
      [RFC5063], and [RFC5495].

3.3.  Optional Features

   Optional features are beyond the basic configuration, and operation
   of the RSVP protocol.  The decision whether to support these RSVP
   features on a particular device is left to the vendor that supports
   the RSVP core features.

Internet-Draft            RSVP YANG Data Model             February 2021


   The following optional features that are covered in the 'ietf-rsvp-
   extended' YANG module:

   o  Advanced operational statistics, including protocol messages,
      packets and errors.

   o  Advanced RSVP authentication features as defined in [RFC2747])
      using various authentication key types including those defined in
      [RFC8177].

   o  Advanced RSVP Refresh Reduction features defined in ([RFC2961]).

   o  Advanced RSVP Hellos features as defined in [RFC3209], and
      [rfc4558].

   o  Advanced RSVP Graceful Restart features as defined in [RFC3473],
      [RFC5063], and [RFC5495].

3.4.  Data Model Structure

   The RSVP YANG data model defines the 'rsvp' top-level container that
   contains the configuration and operational state for the RSVP
   protocol.  The presence of this container enables the RSVP protocol
   functionality.

   The 'rsvp' top-level container also includes data that has router
   level scope (i.e. applicable to all objects modeled under rsvp).  It
   also contains configuration and state data about the following types
   of RSVP objects:

   o  interfaces

   o  neighbors

   o  sessions

   The derived state data is contained in "read-only" nodes directly
   under the intended object as shown in Figure 2.

   The following

   'router-level':

      The router-level scope configuration and state data are applicable
      to all modeled objects under the top-level 'rsvp' container, and
      MAY affect the RSVP protocol behavior.

   'interfaces':

      The 'interfaces' container includes a list of RSVP enabled
      interfaces.  It also includes RSVP configuration and state data
      that is applicable to all interfaces.  An entry in the interfaces
      list MAY carry its own configuration or state data.  Any data or
      state under the "interfaces" container level is equally applicable
      to all interfaces unless it is explicitly overridden by
      configuration or state under a specific interface.

   'neighbors' :





Beeram, et al.           Expires August 23, 2021                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft            RSVP YANG Data Model             February 2021


      The 'neighbors' container includes a list of RSVP neighbors.  An
      entry in the RSVP neighbor list MAY carry its own configuration
      and state relevant to the specific RSVP neighbor.  The RSVP
      neighbors can be dynamically discovered using RSVP signaling, or
      can be explicitly configured.

   'sessions':

      The 'sessions' container includes a list RSVP sessions.  An entry
      in the RSVP session list MAY carry its own configuration and state
      relevant to a specific RSVP session.  RSVP sessions are usually
      derived state that are created as result of signaling.  This model
      defines attributes related to IP RSVP sessions as defined in
      [RFC2205].

   The defined YANG data model supports configuration inheritance for
   neighbors, and interfaces.  Data nodes defined under the main
   container (e.g. the container that encompasses the list of
   interfaces, or neighbors) are assumed to apply equally to all
   elements of the list, unless overridden explicitly for a certain
   element (e.g. interface).

3.5.  Model Notifications

   Modeling notifications data is key in any defined YANG data model.
   [RFC8639] and [RFC8641] define a subscription and push mechanism for
   YANG datastores.  This mechanism currently allows the user to:

   o  Subscribe notifications on a per client basis

   o  Specify subtree filters [RFC6241] or XPath filters [RFC8639] so
      that only interested contents will be sent.

   o  Specify either periodic or on-demand notifications.

4.  RSVP Base YANG Model

   The RSVP base module includes the core features and building blocks
   for modeling the RSVP protocol as described in Section 3.2.

   data and RPCs that are covered in 'ietf-rsvp' YANG module:

   This document registers two YANG modules in the YANG Module Names
   registry [RFC6020].

      name:       ietf-rsvp
      namespace:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-rsvp

      name:       ietf-rsvp-extended
      namespace:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-rsvp-extended
      prefix:     rsvp-extended
      reference:  RFCXXXX

7.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG module(s)
   defined in this document that are writable/creatable/deletable (i.e.,
   config true, which is the default).  These data nodes may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
   Write operations (e.g., <edit-config>) to these data nodes without
   proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
   These are the subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/
   vulnerability:

   /rt:routing/rt:control-plane-protocols/rt:control-plane-protocol/
   rsvp:rsvp/ /rsvp:globals /rsvp:interfaces /rsvp:sessions

Internet-Draft            RSVP YANG Data Model             February 2021


      All of which are considered sensitive and if access to either of
      these is compromised, it can result in temporary network outages
      or be employed to mount DoS attacks.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   /rt:routing/rt:control-plane-protocols/rt:control-plane-protocol/
   rsvp:rsvp/ /rsvp:globals /rsvp:interfaces /rsvp:sessions

      Additional information from these state data nodes can be inferred
      with respect to the network topology, and device location and
      subsequently be used to mount other attacks in the network.

   For RSVP authentication, the configuration supported is via the
   specification of key-chains [RFC8177] or the direct specification of
   key and authentication algorithm, and hence security considerations
   of [RFC8177] are inherited.  This includes the considerations with
   respect to the local storage and handling of authentication keys.

   Some of the RPC operations defined in this YANG module may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It
   is thus important to control access to these operations.  The RSVP
   YANG module support the "clear-session" and "clear-neighbor" RPCs.
   If access to either of these is compromised, they can result in
   temporary network outages be employed to mount DoS attacks.

   The security considerations spelled out in the YANG 1.1 specification
   [RFC7950] apply for this document as well.
