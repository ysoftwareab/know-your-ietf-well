                   draft-ietf-rmcat-wireless-tests-07

Abstract

   The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used for interactive
   multimedia communication applications.  A congestion control
   algorithm is typically required by these applications.  To ensure
   seamless and robust user experience, a well-designed RTP-based
   congestion control algorithm should work well across all access
   network types.  This document describes test cases for evaluating
   performances of such congestion control algorithms over LTE and Wi-Fi
   networks.

Internet-Draft          RMCAT Wireless Test Cases              July 2019


1.  Introduction

   Wireless networks (both cellular and Wi-Fi [IEEE802.11]) are an
   integral part of the Internet.  Mobile devices connected to the
   wireless networks account for an increasingly more significant
   portion of the media traffic over the Internet.  Application
   scenarios range from video conferencing calls in a bus or train to
   media consumption by someone sitting on a living room couch.  It is
   well known that the characteristics and technical challenges for
   supporting multimedia services over wireless are very different from
   those of providing the same service over a wired network.  Even
   though basic test cases for evaluating RTP-based congestion control
   schemes as defined in [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-test] have covered many
   effects of the impairments common to both wired and wireless
   networks, there remain characteristics and dynamics unique to a given
   wireless environment.  For example, in LTE networks, the base station
   maintains individual queues per radio bearer per user hence it leads
   to a different nature of interaction between traffic flows of
   different users.  This contrasts with wired network, where traffic
   from all users share the same queue.  Furthermore, user mobility
   patterns in a cellular network differs from those in a Wi-Fi network.
   Therefore, it is important to evaluate the performance of proposed
   candidate RTP-based congestion control solutions over cellular mobile
   networks and over Wi-Fi networks respectively.

   RMCAT evaluation criteria [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-criteria] document
   provides the guideline for evaluating candidate algorithms and
   recognizes the importance of testing over wireless access networks.
   However, it does not describe any specific test cases for performance
   evaluation of candidate algorithms.  This document describes test
   cases specifically targeting cellular networks such as LTE networks
   and Wi-Fi networks.

2.  Terminologies

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Cellular Network Specific Test Cases

   A cellular environment is more complicated than a wireline ditto
   since it seeks to provide services in the context of variable
   available bandwidth, location dependencies and user mobilities at
   different speeds.  In a cellular network the user may reach the cell
   edge which may lead to a significant amount of retransmissions to

   deliver the data from the base station to the destination and vice
   versa.  These network links or radio links will often act as a
   bottleneck for the rest of the network which will eventually lead to
   excessive delays or packet drops.  An efficient retransmission or
   link adaptation mechanism can reduce the packet loss probability but
   there will still be some packet losses and delay variations.
   Moreover, with increased cell load or handover to a congested cell,
   congestion in transport network will become even worse.  Besides,
   there are certain characteristics which make the cellular network
   different from and more challenging than other types of access
   networks such as Wi-Fi and wired network.  In a cellular network -

   o  The bottleneck is often a shared link with relatively few users.

      *  The cost per bit over the shared link varies over time and is
         different for different users.

      *  Left over/ unused resource can be grabbed by other greedy
         users.

   o  Queues are always per radio bearer hence each user can have many
      of such queues.

   o  Users can experience both Inter and Intra Radio Access Technology
      (RAT) handovers ("handover" definition in [HO-def-3GPP] ).

   o  Handover between cells, or change of serving cells (see in
      [HO-LTE-3GPP] and [HO-UMTS-3GPP] ) might cause user plane
      interruptions which can lead to bursts of packet losses, delay
      and/or jitter.  The exact behavior depends on the type of radio
      bearer.  Typically, the default best effort bearers do not
      generate packet loss, instead packets are queued up and
      transmitted once the handover is completed.

   o  The network part decides how much the user can transmit.

   o  The cellular network has variable link capacity per user

      *  Can vary as fast as a period of milliseconds.

      *  Depends on lots of facts (such as distance, speed,
         interference, different flows).

      *  Uses complex and smart link adaptation which makes the link
         behavior ever more dynamic.

      *  The scheduling priority depends on the estimated throughput.

   o  Both Quality of Service (QoS) and non-QoS radio bearers can be
      used.

   Hence, a real-time communication application operating in such a
   cellular network need to cope with shared bottleneck link and
   variable link capacity, event likes handover, non-congestion related
   loss, abrupt change in bandwidth (both short term and long term) due
   to handover, network load and bad radio coverage.  Even though 3GPP
   define QoS bearers [QoS-3GPP] to ensure high quality user experience,
   adaptive real-time applications are desired.

   Different mobile operators deploy their own cellular network with
   their own set of network functionalities and policies.  Usually, a
   mobile operator network includes 2G, EDGE, 3G and 4G radio access
   technologies.  Looking at the specifications of such radio
   technologies it is evident that only 3G and 4G radio technologies can
   support the high bandwidth requirements from real-time interactive
   video applications.  The future real-time interactive application
   will impose even greater demand on cellular network performance which
   makes 4G (and beyond radio technologies) more suitable access
   technology for such genre of application.

   The key factors to define test cases for cellular networks are

   o  Shared and varying link capacity

   o  Mobility

   o  Handover

   However, for cellular network it is very hard to separate such events
   from one another as these events are heavily related.  Hence instead
   of devising separate test cases for all those important events we
   have divided the test case in two categories.  It should be noted
   that in the following test cases the goal is to evaluate the
   performance of candidate algorithms over radio interface of the
   cellular network.  Hence it is assumed that the radio interface is
   the bottleneck link between the communicating peers and that the core
   network does not add any extra congestion in the path.  Also the
   combination of multiple access technologies such as one user has LTE
   connection and another has Wi-Fi connection is kept out of the scope
   of this document.  However, later those additional scenarios can also
   be added in this list of test cases.  While defining the test cases
   we assumed a typical real-time telephony scenario over cellular
   networks where one real-time session consists of one voice stream and
   one video stream.  We recommend that an LTE network simulator is used
   for the test cases defined in this document, for example-NS-3 LTE
   simulator [LTE-simulator].

3.1.  Varying Network Load

   The goal of this test is to evaluate the performance of the candidate
   congestion control algorithm under varying network load.  The network
   load variation is created by adding and removing network users a.k.a.
   User Equipments (UEs) during the simulation.  In this test case, each
   of the user/UE in the media session is an RMCAT compliant endpoint.
   The arrival of users follows a Poisson distribution, which is
   proportional to the length of the call, so that the number of users
   per cell is kept fairly constant during the evaluation period.  At
   the beginning of the simulation there should be enough time to warm-
   up the network.  This is to avoid running the evaluation in an empty
   network where network nodes are having empty buffers, low
   interference at the beginning of the simulation.  This network
   initialization period is therefore excluded from the evaluation
   period.

   This test case also includes user mobility and competing traffic.
   The competing traffic includes both same kind of flows (with same
   adaptation algorithms) and different kind of flows (with different
   service and congestion control).  The investigated congestion control
   algorithms should show maximum possible network utilization and
   stability in terms of rate variations, lowest possible end to end
   frame latency, network latency and Packet Loss Rate (PLR) at
   different cell load level.

3.1.1.  Network Connection

   Each mobile user is connected to a fixed user.  The connection
   between the mobile user and fixed user consists of a LTE radio
   access, an Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and an Internet connection.  The
   mobile user is connected to the EPC using LTE radio access technology
   which is further connected to the Internet.  The fixed user is
   connected to the Internet via wired connection with sufficiently high
   bandwidth, for instance, 10 Gbps, so that the system is resource-
   limited on the wireless interface.  The Internet and wired connection
   in this setup does not introduce any network impairments to the test;
   it only adds 10ms of one-way propagation delay.

   The path from the fixed user to mobile user is defines as "Downlink"
   and the path from mobile user to the fixed user is defined as
   "Uplink".  We assume that only uplink or downlink is congested for
   the mobile users.  Hence, we recommend that the uplink and downlink
   simulations are run separately.

   cell radius than previous test case.  In this test case each of the
   user/UE in the media session is an RMCAT compliant endpoint.  The
   arrival of users follows a Poisson distribution, which is
   proportional to the length of the call, so that the number of users
   per cell is kept fairly constant during the evaluation period.  At
   the beginning of the simulation there should be enough amount of time
   to warm-up the network.  This is to avoid running the evaluation in
   an empty network where network nodes are having empty buffers, low
   interference at the beginning of the simulation.  This network
   initialization period is therefore excluded from the evaluation
   period.

   This test case also includes user mobility and competing traffic.
   The competing traffic includes same kind of flows (with same
   adaptation algorithms) . The investigated congestion control
   algorithms should show maximum possible network utilization and
   stability in terms of rate variations, lowest possible end to end
   frame latency, network latency and Packet Loss Rate (PLR) at
   different cell load level.

       following:

       A.  Deployment and propagation model : 3GPP case 3 [Deployment]

       B.  Cell radius: 577.3333 Meters

       C.  Mobility: 3km/h

   2.  User intensity = {0.7, 1.4, 2.1, 2.8, 3.5, 4.2, 4.9, 5.6, 6.3,

       *  Unlink simulation: Maximum of 1Mbps/cell (web browsing or FTP
          traffic following default TCP congestion control [RFC5681])

3.3.  Desired Evaluation Metrics for cellular test cases

   RMCAT evaluation criteria document [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-criteria]
   defines metrics to be used to evaluate candidate algorithms.
   However, looking at the nature and distinction of cellular networks
   we recommend at minimum following metrics to be used to evaluate the
   performance of the candidate algorithms for the test cases defined in
   this document.

   The desired metrics are-

   o  Average cell throughput (for all cells), shows cell utilizations.

   o  Application sending and receiving bitrate, goodput.

   o  Packet Loss Rate (PLR).

   o  End to end Media frame delay.  For video, this means the delay
      from capture to display.

   o  Transport delay.

   o  Algorithm stability in terms of rate variation.

4.  Wi-Fi Networks Specific Test Cases

   Given the prevalence of Internet access links over Wi-Fi, it is
   important to evaluate candidate RMCAT congestion control solutions
   over test cases that include Wi-Fi access lines.  Such evaluations
   should also highlight the inherent different characteristics of Wi-Fi
   networks in contrast to wired networks:

   o  The wireless radio channel is subject to interference from nearby
      transmitters, multipath fading, and shadowing, causing
      fluctuations in link throughput and sometimes an error-prone
      communication environment

   o  Available network bandwidth is not only shared over the air
      between cocurrent users, but also between uplink and downlink
      traffic due to the half duplex nature of wireless transmission
      medium.

   o  Packet transmissions over Wi-Fi are susceptible to contentions and
      collisions over the air.  Consequently, traffic load beyond a
      certain utilization level over a Wi-Fi network can introduce

      frequent collisions over the air and significant network overhead,
      as well as packet drops due to buffer overflow at the
      transmitters.  This, in turn, leads to excessive delay,
      retransmissions, packet losses and lower effective bandwidth for
      applications.  Note, however, that the consequent delay and loss
      patterns caused by collisions are qualitatively different from
      those induced by congestion over a wired connection.

   o  The IEEE 802.11 standard (i.e., Wi-Fi) supports multi-rate
      transmission capabilities by dynamically choosing the most
      appropriate modulation scheme for a given received signal
      strength.  A different choice of physical-layer rate leads to
      different application-layer throughput.

   o  Presence of legancy 802.11b networks can significantly slow down
      the the rest of a modern Wi-Fi Network.  As discussed in
      [Heusse2003]since it takes longer to transmit the same packet over
      a slower link than over a faster link.

   o  Handover from one Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) to another may lead to
      packet delay and losses during the process.

   o  IEEE 802.11e defined EDCA/WMM (Enhanced DCF Channel Access/Wi-Fi
      Multi-Media) to give voice and video streams higher priority over
      pure data applications (e.g., file transfers).

   In summary, presence of Wi-Fi access links in different network
   topologies can exert different impact on the network performance in
   terms of application-layer effective throughput, packet loss rate,
   and packet delivery delay.  These, in turn, influence the behavior of
   end-to-end real-time multimedia congestion control.

   Unless otherwise mentioned, test cases in this section are described
   using the underlying PHY- and MAC-layer parameters based on the IEEE
   802.11n Standard.  Statistics collected from enterprise Wi-Fi
   networks show that the two dominant physical modes are 802.11n and
   802.11ac, accounting for 41% and 58% of connected devices.  As Wi-Fi
   standards evolve over time, for instance, with the introduction of
   the emerging Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) products, the PHY- and MAC-layer test
   case specifications need to be updated accordingly to reflect such
   changes.

   Typically, a Wi-Fi access network connects to a wired infrastructure.
   Either the wired or the Wi-Fi segment of the network could be the
   bottleneck.  In the following sections, we describe basic test cases
   for both scenarios separately.  The same set of performance metrics
   as in [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-test]) should be collected for each test
   case.

   All test cases described below can be carried out using simulations,
   e.g. based on [ns-2] or [ns-3].  When feasible, it is also encouraged
   to perform testbed-based evaluations using Wi-Fi access points and
   endpoints running up-to-date IEEE 802.11 protocols, such as 802.11ac
   and the emerging Wi-Fi 6, to verify the viability of the candidate
   schemes.

4.1.  Bottleneck in Wired Network

   The test scenarios below are intended to mimic the setup of video
   conferencing over Wi-Fi connections from the home.  Typically, the
   Wi-Fi home network is not congested and the bottleneck is present
   over the wired home access link.  Although it is expected that test
   evaluation results from this section are similar to those from test
   cases defined for wired networks (see [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-test]), it
   is worthwhile to run through these tests as sanity checks.

4.1.1.  Network topology

   Figure 2 shows topology of the network for Wi-Fi test cases.  The
   test contains multiple mobile nodes (MNs) connected to a common Wi-Fi
   access point (AP) and their corresponding wired clients on fixed
   nodes (FNs).  Each connection carries either RMCAT or TCP traffic
   flow.  Directions of the flows can be uplink, downlink, or bi-
   directional.

   o  Single uplink RMCAT flow: N=1 with uplink direction and M=0.

   o  One pair of bi-directional RMCAT flows: N=2 (with one uplink flow
      and one downlink flow); M=0.

      uplink: N=1 (uplink) and M = 1(uplink), TCP start time at 0s and
      end time at 119s.

4.1.4.  Expected behavior

   o  Single uplink RMCAT flow: the candidate algorithm is expected to
      detect the path capacity constraint, to converge to bottleneck
      link capacity and to adapt the flow to avoid unwanted oscillation
      when the sending bit rate is approaching the bottleneck link
      capacity.  No excessive rate oscillations should be present.

   o  Bi-directional RMCAT flows: It is expected that the candidate
      algorithm is able to converge to the bottleneck capacity of the
      wired path on both directions despite presence of measurment noise
      over the Wi-Fi connection.  In the presence of background TCP or
      CBR over UDP traffic, the rate of RMCAT flows should adapt in a
      timely manner to changes in the available bottleneck bandwidth.

   o  One RMCAT flow competing with long-live TCP flow over uplink: the
      candidate algorithm should be able to avoid congestion collapse,
      and to stablize at a fair share of the bottleneck link capacity.

4.2.  Bottleneck in Wi-Fi Network

   These test cases assume that the wired portion along the media path
   is well-provisioned whereas the bottleneck exists over the Wi-Fi
   access network.  This is to mimic the application scenarios typically
   encountered by users in an enterprise environment or at a coffee
   house.

4.2.3.  Typical test scenarios

   This section describes a few test scenarios that are deemed as
   important for understanding the behavior of a RMCAT candidate
   solution over a Wi-Fi network.



Sarker, et al.           Expires January 2, 2020               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft          RMCAT Wireless Test Cases              July 2019


   o  Multiple RMCAT Flows Sharing the Wireless Downlink: N=16 (all
      downlink); M = 0.  This test case is for studying the impact of
      contention on competing RMCAT flows.  For an 802.11n network,
      given the MCS Index of 11 and the corresponding raw data rate of
      52Mbps, the total application-layer throughput (assuming
      reasonable distance, low interference and infrequent contentions
      caused by competing streams) is around 20Mbps.  Consequently, a
      total of N=16 RMCAT flows are needed to saturate the wireless
      interface in this experiment.  Evaluation of a given candidate
      solution should focus on whether downlink RMCAT flows can stablize
      at a fair share of total application-layer throughput.

   o  Multiple RMCAT Flows Sharing the Wireless Uplink: N = 16 (all
      downlink); M = 0.  When multiple clients attempt to transmit video
      packets uplink over the wireless interface, they introduce more
      frequent contentions and potential collisions.  Per-flow
      throughput is expected to be lower than that in the previous
      downlink-only scenario.  Evaluation of a given candidate solution
      should focus on whether uplink flows can stablize at a fair share
      of application-layer throughput.

   o  Multiple Bi-directional RMCAT Flows: N = 16 (8 uplink and 8
      downlink); M = 0.  The goal of this test is to evaluate
      performance of the candidate solution in terms of bandwidth
      fairness between uplink and downlink flows.

   o  Multiple Bi-directional RMCAT Flows with on-off CBR traffic: N =
      16 (8 uplink and 8 downlink); M = 5(uplink).  The goal of this
      test is to evaluate adaptation behavior of the candidate solution
      when its available bandwidth changes due to departure of
      background traffic.  The background traffic consists of several
      (e.g., M=5) CBR flows transported over UDP, which are ON at times
      t=0-60s and are OFF at times t=61-120s.

   o  Multiple Bi-directional RMCAT Flows with off-on CBR traffic: N =
      16 (8 uplink and 8 downlink); M = 5(uplink).  The goal of this
      test is to evaluate adaptation behavior of the candidate solution
      when its available bandwidth changes due to arrival of background
      traffic.  The background traffic consists of several (e.g., M=5)
      parallel CBR flows transported over UDP, which are OFF at times
      t=0-60s and are ON at times t=61-120s.

   o  Multiple Bi-directional RMCAT flows in the presence of background
      TCP traffic: N=16 (8 uplink and 8 downlink); M = 5 (uplink).  The
      goal of this test is to evaluate how RMCAT flows compete against
      TCP over a congested Wi-Fi network for a given candidate solution.
      TCP start time: 40s, end time: 80s.

   o  Varying number of RMCAT flows.  A series of tests can be carried
      out for the above test cases with different values of N, e.g., N =
      [4, 8, 12, 16, 20].  The goal of this test is to evaluate how a
      candidate RMCAT solution responds to varying traffic load/demand
      over a congested Wi-Fi network.  The start time of these RMCAT
      flows is randomly distributed within a window of t=0-10s, whereas
      their end times are randomly distributed within a window of
      t=110-120s.

4.2.4.  Expected behavior

   o  Multiple downlink RMCAT flows: each RMCAT flow should get its fair
      share of the total bottleneck link bandwidth.  Overall bandwidth
      usage should not be significantly lower than that experienced by
      the same number of concurrent downlink TCP flows.  In other words,
      the performance of multiple concurrent TCP flows will be used as a
      performance benchmark for this test scenario.  The end-to-end
      delay and packet loss ratio experienced by each flow should be
      within acceptable range for real-time multimedia applications.

   o  Multiple uplink RMCAT flows: overall bandwidth usage shared by all
      RMCAT flows should not be significantly lower than that
      experienced by the same number of concurrent uplink TCP flows.  In
      other words, the performance of multiple concurrent TCP flows will
      be used as a performance benchmark for this test scenario.

   o  Multiple bi-directional RMCAT flows with dynamic background
      traffic carrying CBR flows over UDP: RMCAT flows should adapt in a
      timely fashion to the resulting changes in available bandwidth.

   o  Multiple bi-directional RMCAT flows with dynamic background
      traffic over TCP: during the presence of TCP background flows, the
      overall bandwidth usage shared by all RMCAT flows should not be
      significantly lower than those achieved by the same number of bi-
      directional TCP flows.  In other words, the performance of
      multiple concurrent TCP flows will be used as a performance
      benchmark for this test scenario.  All downlink RMCAT flows are
      expected to obtain similar bandwidth with respect to each other.
      The throughput of RMCAT flows should decrease upon the arrival of
      TCP background traffic and increase upon their departure, both
      reactions should occur in a timely fashion (e.g., within 10s of
      seconds).

   o  Varying number of RMCAT flows: the test results for varying values
      of N -- while keeping all other parameters constant -- is expected
      to show steady and stable per-flow throughtput for each value of
      N.  The average throughput of all RMCAT flows is expected to stay
      constant around the maximum rate when N is small, then gradually

      decrease with increasing number of RMCAT flows till it reaches the
      minimum allowed rate, beyond which the offered load to the Wi-Fi
      network (with a large value of N) is exceeding its capacity.

4.3.  Other Potential Test Cases

4.3.1.  EDCA/WMM usage

   EDCA/WMM is prioritized QoS with four traffic classes (or Access
   Categories) with differing priorities.  RMCAT flows should achieve
   better performance (i.e., lower delay, fewer packet losses) with
   EDCA/WMM enabled when competing against non-interactive background
   traffic (e.g., file transfers).  When most of the traffic over Wi-Fi
   is dominated by media, however, turning on WMM may actually degrade
   performance since all media flows now attempt to access the wireless
   transmission medium more aggressively, thereby causing more frequent
   collisions and collision-induced losses.  This is a topic worthy of
   further investigation.

4.3.2.  Effects of Legacy 802.11b Devices

   When there is 802.11b devices connected to modern 802.11 network, it
   may affect the performance of the whole network.  Additional test
   cases can be added to evaluate the affects of legancy devices on the
   performance of RMCAT congestion control algorithm.

5.  Conclusion

   This document defines a collection of test cases that are considered
   important for cellular and Wi-Fi networks.  Moreover, this document
   also provides a framework for defining additional test cases over
   wireless cellular/Wi-Fi networks.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-criteria] and the
   relevant congestion control algorithms apply.  The principles for
   congestion control are described in [RFC2914], and in particular any
   new method MUST implement safeguards to avoid congestion collapse of
   the Internet.

   The evaluation of the test cases are intended to be run in a
   controlled lab environment.  Hence, the applications, simulators and
   network nodes ought to be well-behaved and should not impact the

   desired results.  It is important to take appropriate caution to
   avoid leaking non-responsive traffic from unproven congestion
   avoidance techniques onto the open Internet.
