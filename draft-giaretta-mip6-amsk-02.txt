Abstract 
    
   The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) defines an extensible 
   framework for performing network access authentication. Most EAP 
   authentication algorithms, also known as "methods", export keying 
   material that can be used with lower layer ciphersuites. It can be 
   useful to leverage this keying material to derive usage specific 
   keys that can be used to authenticate users or protect information 
   exchange by other applications or services.For this purpose [10] 
   proposes to derive root keys for each usage application and, then, 
   child keys to actual be used.  
   This document defines how to generate a Usage Specific Root Key 
   (USRK) and a series of Application Master Session Keys (AMSKs) 
   specific to Mobile IPv6 service. These AMSKs can be used by Mobile 
   Node and Home Agent to bootstrap Mobile IPv6 protocol operation.

1. Introduction 
    
   Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) requires that Mobile Nodes (MNs) and Home 
   Agents (HAs) share a security association to protect binding 
   management signaling. The MIPv6 protocol specification [1] 
   mandates the use of IPsec for this purpose and therefore requires 
   the MN to be provisioned with the data needed to bootstrap an 
   IPsec Security Association (SA) with its Home Agent. This is one 
   of the main issues of the so called Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping 
   problem [11]. The IPsec SA between MN and HA can be established 
   from a shared secret using IKE with Pre-Shared Key (PSK) 
   authentication [6]. Alternatively, the Authentication Protocol for 
   MIPv6 [5] presents a different security mechanism for Mobile IPv6 
   that requires a shared secret between MN and HA to authenticate 
   the binding messages. In scenarios where network access control is 
   based on EAP those shared secrets can be derived from the EAP key 
   hierarchy [13]. In particular [10] specifies a mechanism for 
   deriving cryptographically separate root keys from the EMSK, 
   called Usage Specific Root Keys (USRK) in order to create a set of 
   keys for usage specific needs.  
    
   This document defines how to generate EAP derived key (USRK) 
   specific for Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping. In addition, it defines 
   how to derive application specific keys (AMSKs) both for IPsec SAs 
   and Authentication Protocol SAs. The solution presented in this 
   document is agnostic of the AAA-HA interface model (e.g. push/pull 
   model).

2. Terminology 
 
   Most of the terms used in this document are defined in this 
   section; more detailed general mobility and EAP terminology can be 
   found in [7] and [13].  
    
   MSA 
    
        Mobility Service Authorizer. A service provider that 
        authorizes Mobile IPv6 service. 
    
   ASA 
    
        Access Service Authorizer. A network operator that 
        authenticates a mobile host and establishes the mobile 
        host's authorization to receive Internet service. 
    
   Split scenario 
    
         A scenario where the mobility service and the network access 
         service are authorized by different entities (MSA!=ASA). 
          
   Integrated scenario 
    
         A scenario where the mobility service and the network access 
         service are authorized by the same entity (MSA=ASA). 
    
   EAP server 
    
        The entity that terminates the EAP authentication method 
        with the peer.  In the case where no backend authentication 
        server is used, the EAP server is part of the authenticator.  
        In the case where the authenticator operates in pass-through 
        mode, the EAP server is located on the backend 
        authentication server. 
         
   MSK   Master Session key 
          
         Keying material that is derived between the EAP peer and 
         server and exported by the EAP method. The MSK is at least 
         64 octets in length. 
          
   EMSK  Extended Master Session Key 
    
         Additional keying material derived between the peer and 
         server that is exported by the EAP method. The EMSK is at 
         least 64 octets in length, and is never shared with a third 
         party. 
 
   USRK  Usage Specific Root Key 
    
         Keys derived from the EMSK which are cryptographically 
         separate from each other.  
    
   AMSK  Application Master Session Key 
    
         Keys derived from the USRK which are cryptographically 
         separate from each other.  
    
   MN    Mobile Node  
    
         A node that can change its point of attachment from one link 
         to another, while still being reachable via its home 
         address.

   HA    Home Agent  
    
         A router on a mobile node's home link with which the mobile 
         node has registered its current care-of address.  While the 
         mobile node is away from home, the home agent intercepts 
         packets on the home link addressed to the mobile node's home 
         address, encapsulates them, and tunnels them to the mobile 
         node's registered care-of address. 
    
   BU    Binding Update  
    
         A message indicating a mobile node's current mobility 
         binding, and in particular its care-of address. 
    
   BA    Binding Acknowledgement  
    
         A message used to acknowledge receipt of a Binding Update.

3. Applicability Statement 
    
   The Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping problem statement [11] describes two 
   main scenarios.  In the first scenario (i.e. the split scenario), 
   the mobility service is authorized by a different service 
   authorizer (MSA, Mobility Service Authorizer) than the basic 
   network access authorizer (ASA, Access Service Authorizer). In the 
   second scenario (i.e. the integrated scenario), the mobile node's 
   mobility service is authorized by the same service authorizer as 
   the basic network access service authorizer.  This implies that 
   only in the integrated scenario it is possible to leverage the 
   network access authentication to bootstrap mobility service. 
   Therefore, the approach defined in this document applies only to 
   the integrated scenario. 
    
   This specification assumes that AAA server and the EAP server are 
   co-located, with the latter exporting the keys to the former. As 
   already pointed out, the solution presented here addresses both 
   the IPsec and rfc4285-based SAs bootstrapping. 
    
3.1 Bootstrapping IPsec SAs with Pre-shared keys 
    
   The bootstrapping solution defined for integrated scenario [19] 
   requires the mobile node to run an EAP exchange over IKEv2. In 
   case the mobile node uses EAP for network access authentication, 
   this implies that the MN executes two EAP exchanges, possibly with 
   the same EAP server and using the same credentials. 
    
   Therefore, in this scenario a key derived from EAP key hierarchy 
   and named IKEv2-AMSK can be used as the IKEv2 Pre-shared Key 
   (PSK), with the advantage that only one EAP exchange is performed 
   (during network access authentication).  
    
   The key is derived by the MN and the AAAH server and needs to be 
   transferred to the HA (together with the MN/key identifier).  Two 
   different approaches are possible:  
    
     1. The AAAH server sends proactively the key to the HA (push 
        approach). A requirement for this approach is that the AAAH 
        server needs to know the HA assigned to the MN. 
      
     2. The HA requests to the AAAH the PSK during the IKEv2 
        exchange with the MN (pull approach). In this case the HA 
        needs to know the AAAH server used by a specific MN for 
        network access authentication. 
 
   Figure 1 and 2 (pag. 8) show the message flow of the two models. 
   Note that in both approaches the MN/key identifier must be sent 
   via the AAA-HA interface and needs to be the same identifier used 
   in IKEv2. 
    
3.2 Bootstrapping rfc4285-based SAs 
    
   Concerning rfc4285-based SAs, the keying material derived from EAP 
   can be exploited in two different ways, since two possible 
   authentication options are specified: 
    
    
     1. MN-HA Mobility Message Authentication Option. In this case a 
        key derived from EAP key hierarchy and named MN-HA-AMSK, is 
        used as the shared key for the security association between 
        the MN and HA. Similarly to the IKEv2 Pre-shared key case, 
        both the push and pull model can be envisioned for key 
        delivery. The MN/key identifier must be sent via the AAA-HA

        interface and needs to be the same identifier to be used as 
        Mobile Node Identifier (in the form of NAI) in the BUs. 
      
     2. MN-AAA Mobility Message Authentication Option. In this case 
        a key derived from EAP key hierarchy and named MN-AAA-AMSK, 
        is used as the shared-key for the security association 
        between the MN and the AAAH server. In this case, no key 
        delivery is needed.

4. Key derivation 
    
   The key hierarchy proposed in this document is depicted in Figure 
   3. Just one key (MIP6-USRK) is directly derived from the EMSK. 
   Three different keys are then generated from the MIP6-USRK: IKEv2-
   AMSK, MN-HA-AMSK and MN-AAA-AMSK. The basic assumption is that the 
   MIP6-USRK is exported by the EAP server to the AAA server that 
   sends this key to the HA; the other keys are then derived directly 
   from the USRK by the HA of the MSP.

4.1 Mobile IPv6 USRK derivation 
    
   Mobile IPv6 USRK (MIP6-USRK) is derived through the general key 
   derivation function (KDF) specified in [10]. The KDF is based on a 
   pseudo random function shown below: 
    
   KDF = PRF(key, data) 
    
   where: 
    
   PRF = HMAC-SHA-256 
   key = EMSK 
   data = label + "\0" + op-data + length 
   label = MIPv6-USRK-key 
   op-data = EAP Session-ID 
   length = 128 bit 
   "\0" = is a NUL byte (0x00 in hex) 
   + denotes concatenation 
    
   Key name = PRF-64 (EAP Session-ID, key-label) 
   Where PRF-64 is the first 64 bits from the output. 
    
4.2 Mobile IPv6 AMSKs derivation 
    
   Based on Mobile IPv6 USRK, the keys for Mobile IPv6 operations 
   (IKEv2-AMSK, MN-HA-AMSK, and MN-AAA-AMSK) can be generated. These 
   keys are derived as follows: 
    
   KDF (K,L,D,O) = T1 | T2 | T3 | T4 | ... 
    
         where: 
         T1 = prf (K, S | 0x01) 
         T2 = prf (K, T1 | S | 0x02) 
         T3 = prf (K, T2 | S | 0x03) 
         T4 = prf (K, T3 | S | 0x04) 
    
         prf = HMAC-SHA-256 
         K = USRK-MIPv6 
         L = key label 
         D = application data 
         O = output length 
         S = L | " " | D | O 
    
   The application specific parameters are set as follows:

Internet-Draft           AMSK for Mobile IPv6             October 2006 
 
 
    
   IKEv2 Pre-shared key AMSK (IKEv2-AMSK): 
         key label = "MIPv6-IKEv2-key" 
         application data = "HA Address" 
         output length = variable (default 128) 
   (key name = PRF-64(IKEv2-AMSK | EAP Session-ID) 
    
   rfc4285 MN-HA key (MN-HA-AMSK):  
         key label = "rfc4285-MN-HA-key" 
         application data = "HA Address" 
         output length = 128 bit 
   (key name  = PRF-64(MN-HA-AMSK | EAP Session-ID) 
    
   rfc4285 MN-AAA key (MN-AAA-AMSK): 
         key label = "rfc4285-MN-AAA-key" 
         application data = "" 
         output length = 128 bit 
   (key name = PRF-64(MN-AAA-AMSK | EAP Session-ID) 
    
 
   The actual key(s) to be derived by MN and HA depend on the 
   authentication method deployed by the operator (or imposed by 
   specific technologies). It should be possible on the operator side 
   to differentiate users' authentication method on profile basis.  
    
   The KDF does not include the home address in the application data 
   because in this way the MN can derive the AMSK even if it does not 
   know its home address yet. This is what might happen in some 
   dynamic home address assignment scenarios. 
    
4.3 Lifetimes 
    
   As specified in [10] the lifetime of USRK keys must be equal to 
   the lifetime of the EMSK. Lifetime of child keys, instead, can be 
   different then root key’s lifetime and its specification is left 
   to usage definition.  
 
   Since the IKEv2-AMSK serves only for identity verification and not 
   for authentication or ciphering purposes, there might be no need 
   to re-generate the key at regular intervals. For this reason its 
   lifetime is set equal to the MIP6-USRK lifetime.  
    
   Since the MN-HA key is used to authenticate BUs and BAs messages, 
   there is a clear need to keep these keys fresh and therefore to 
   derive new keys periodically. This is discussed in section 5.3.  
    
   Obviously all keys must be refreshed whenever a new EMSK is 
   generated (i.e. during re-authentication events).

5. Open issues 
    
   The usage of EAP-derived keying material is still a work in 
   progress in IETF and a good amount of study is underway to 
   standardize generation and usage for keys generated from the EMSK. 
   For this reason, this document leaves open some issues as input 
   for HOKEY WG and others related WGs. 
    
5.1 Key length (and other key related parameters) 
    
   This specification doesn't address the problem of negotiating the 
   key length; this is a general issue for AMSKs and should be solved 
   in a generic way, not depending on the application that makes use 
   of the keys (e.g. Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping).  
    
   One very basic approach, applicable to some scenarios, is that the 
   operator pre-provisions the user equipment with the right 
   parameters (e.g. the right key lenght for a specific application). 
    
   If an explicit negotiation is needed, a possible approach could be 
   the one adopted in [18] that leverages the capability of some EAP 
   methods (e.g. EAP-SIM, EAP-FAST, etc.) to carry arbitrary 
   parameters during the authentication phase. 
    
   However, it is worthwhile noting that some applications require 
   only fixed length keys (e.g. MN-HA-AMSK and MN-AAA-AMSK for the 
   MIPv6 Authentication Protocol) and for those applications this is 
   not an issue.  
    
5.2 rfc4285 SAs 
    
   This document addresses only the negotiation of the shared secret 
   among MN and HA (or AAA). Other parameters such as SPIs must be 
   negotiated through other mechanisms. As for the key length issue 
   this could be addressed by an explicit negotiation [18]. Another 
   approach might be the derivation of the SPI from the EAP keying 
   hierarchy itself. 
    
5.3 Key Freshness 
  
   While not an issue for IKEv2 PSK authentication, for rfc2485-based 
   authentications the keys used to authenticate binding management 
   messages should be fresh and therefore periodically changed. This 
   document addresses only bootstrapping mechanisms and so the 
   renewal of keying material is out of scope. A suggested solution 
   may be that a new MN-HA-AMSK is generated at each BU/BA completed 
   exchange (e.g. exchanging nonces in BUs and BAs).  
    
5.4 Multiple EAP sessions 
    
   In some scenarios (e.g. multi-homed terminals) a MN may have more 
   than one active EAP session at the same time. Therefore, there is 
   the need to define criteria for deciding which session(s) are in 
   charge of generating AMSKs, and for which applications. 
    
5.5 Identity management and key binding 
    
   A MN can be associated to several identities at the same time 
   (e.g. pseudonyms for identity privacy or temporary identities for 
   EAP fast reconnect techniques like [9]). The AAAH server must be 
   aware of the identity used by the MN in IKEv2 or rfc-4285 
   signaling. In pull model this is needed to allow the AAAH server 
   to select the correct key to be delivered, upon requests, to the 
   HA. In push model this is needed to allow the AAAH server to

   proactively deliver to the HA the correct MN identity information 
   so that the HA can bind the subsequent authentication requests to 
   the right key.

6. AAA-HA interface requirements 
 
   In order to fulfil the bootstrapping of MIPv6-related SAs, this 
   document adds/modifies some requirements for the HA-AAA interface 
   [21]: 
    
   -  G1.4 should use MUST (instead of SHOULD): "The AAA-HA interface 
      MUST provide confidentiality since it may be used to transfer 
      keying material (e.g. shared key generated during EAP 
      authentication)"  
    
   -  HAs must be able to fetch keys from AAA servers (pull approach) 
 
   -  the AAAH server must be able to push a key into the HA (push 
      approach) 
 
   -  key identifiers and lifetimes must be transferred alongside the 
      key 
 
   -  in the request sent to the AAAH server in pull mode, HA must 
      specify the HA address known be the MN, so that the AAAH server 
      can derive the right key.

7. Security Considerations 
    
   Sending USRK for Mobile IPv6 from the AAA server to the HA 
   requires that the protocol used for AAA-HA communication provides 
   mutual authentication, integrity/reply protection and 
   confidentiality. 
    
   Moreover, since this document is strongly based on EAP [8] and the 
   EAP Keying Management Framework [13], additional security 
   considerations are bound to those valid for the EAP Keying 
   Framework.
