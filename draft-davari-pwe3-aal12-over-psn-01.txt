2. Introduction 
    
   Currently a great portion of voice and TDM traffic is carried over 
   ATM networks using AAL1 adaptation layer. As the service providers 
   migrate to IP/MPLS networks there is a need to transport AAL1 
   traffic over IP/MPLS networks.  
    
   This document describes methods for transporting AAL1 over IP/MPLS 
   networks, using the ATM transport modes described in [ATM-encap] 
   without introducing any new protocol. This document extends the 
   applicability of equipments that implement [ATM-encap], to 
   transporting AAL1 traffic and potentially enables transport of TDM 
   circuit emulation traffic over IP/MPLS networks as explained in 
   [draft-anavi].

   Note 1: Throughout this document, Ùfragmentationˆ means PDU 
   fragmentation procedures as described in [ATM-encap]. 
    
   Note 2: Throughout this document, AAL1 PDU means the 48-byte AAL1 
   SAR-PDU as described in [ITU-AAL1]. 
    
   Note 3: Since SDU mode is explicitly designed only for AAL5 
   transport; it cannot be used to transport AAL1. 
    
    
3. Applicability 
    
   The primary applications supported by AAL1 transport over PSN are 
   CBR services such as voice and TDM services. 
    
   The AAL1 transport takes advantage of the N:1 cell mode, described 
   in [draft-martini,] to provide a default standard method for 
   carrying AAL1 traffic. In addition it optionally also takes 
   advantage of 1:1 cell mode and PDU mode, described in [ATM-encap], 
   to increase bandwidth efficiency. The nature of the service, as 
   defined by the [ATM service] or the [ATM transfer capability] should 
   be preserved. To provide this, the basic requirement of the ATM-PSN 
   interworking function is to map the AAL1 PDU frames belonging to a 
   VCC, together with any related OAM, RM cells and protocol control 
   information, into a PW. 
    
   The benefits of this model to service providers and vendors are: 
        
       i.   Leveraging existing systems and services to provide 
            increased capacity from a packet switched core. 
       ii.  Preserving existing network operational processes and 
            procedures used to maintain the legacy services e.g. AAL1, 
            ATM OAM and ATM security. 
       iii. Using the common packet switched network infrastructure to 
            support both the core capacity requirements of existing 
            services and the requirements of new services supported 
            natively over the packet switched network. 
       iv.  Leveraging the same hardware and software used for 
            transporting ATM over IP/MPLS networks to transport AAL1 
            and TDM signals over those networks. 
       v.   Leveraging off the shelf hardware and software that emulate 
            TDM over AAL1 to transport TDM signals over IP/MPLS 
            network. 
        
        
4. Implementation and deployment consideration 
    
   The procedures mentioned in this draft, apply in most part to any 
   ATM AAL type, but the scope of this draft is the AAL1 frame 
   transport over a PSN. It leverages the modes and options already 
   defined in [ATM-encap] and does not introduce any new protocol, and 
   therefore is backward compatible with hardware and software 
   developed for Martini-compliant equipments.

                  Transport of AAL1 frames over PSN        March 2003 
    
   For bandwidth efficiency reasons the AAL1 frame transport may use 
   PDU mode. To take advantage of the PDU mode, the fragmentation 
   procedure for bounding cell transfer delay as described in [ATM-
   encap] MUST be used. This means that the ingress PE MUST have the 
   PDU fragmentation capability that will limit the payload size of the 
   IP/MPLS packet to Nx48 bytes, in which N is a pre-configured value 
   that bounds the cell transfer delay. 
    
   Since services that use AAL1, such as circuit emulation service, 
   expect in-order delivery of data, for the purpose of AAL1 transport, 
   it is advantageous to use the control word∆s Sequence number. 
   However, sequence number usage is optional as per [ATM-encap].  
    
5. Limitations 
 
   AAL1 frame transport only supports point-to-point LSPs. Multi point-
   to-point and point-to-multi-point are for further study (FFS). 
    
   To have bi-directional connectivity, as required in ATM, two LSPs 
   should be configured, one for each direction (ATM-to-MPLS and MPLS 
   to-ATM) of the ATM connection. 
    
   This draft does not preserve the value of the CLP bit for every ATM 
   cell. Therefore, transparency of the CLP setting may be violated. 
   Additionally, tagging of some cells may occur when tagging is not 
   allowed by the conformance definition. 
    
   This draft does not preserve the EFCI state for every ATM cell. 
   Therefore, transparency of the EFCI state may be violated. 
    
6. AAL1 transport using N:1 cell mode 
    
   N:1 cell mode is the only default and mandatory mode described in  
   [ATM-encap]. To be fully compliant with [ATM-encap], this document 
   also recommends the N: 1 cell mode as the default mode for 
   transporting AAL1 traffic over IP/MPLS networks. 
    
   Using N: 1 cell mode, one or more AAL1 stream could be transported 
   over a single PW. Individual AAL1 streams are differentiated from 
   each other by the VPI/VCI that is carried with each cell. 
    
   The following figure shows how multiple CBR streams could be 
   transported over a single PW using N:1 cell mode.

     Figure 1: AAL1 transport over PSN using Martini N: 1 cell mode  
      
   In this figure CBR streams are attached to an AAL1 block. The AAL1 
   block performs the AAL1 adaptation function as specified in [ITU 
   AAL1]. The outputs of the AAL1 block contain 48-byte AAL1-PDUs. The 
   ATM block performs the ATM layer functions by adding 5-byte ATM 
   headers to the 48-byte AAL1-PDUs with proper VPI/VCI. Each AAL1 
   stream is assigned a unique VPI/VCI based on the interface at which 
   it arrives to the ATM block. The ATM block then generates an ATM 
   stream toward a Martini (N:1) block, which then transports the ATM 
   cells over a single PW (PW1), according to the N:1 cell mode of 
   [ATM-encap]. Each IP/MPLS packet may carry one or more cells 
   belonging to one or more AAL1 streams. 
    
   The AAL1 and ATM blocks could be located in the CE or in the PE. If 
   they are in CE, then the link between CE-PE is an ATM link, while if 
   they are in PE, then the link between CE-PE is a TDM link. 
    
    
7. AAL1 transport using 1:1 cell mode  
    
   1:1 cell mode is an optional mode described in  [ATM-encap], and is 
   more bandwidth efficient than N:1 cell mode. To be fully compliant 
   with [ATM-encap], this document also permits the usage of 1:1 cell 
   mode as an optional mode for transporting AAL1 traffic over IP/MPLS 
   networks. 
    
   Using 1:1 cell mode, only one AAL1 stream could be transported over 
   a single PW. Individual AAL1 streams are differentiated from each 
   other by the PW that they are carried in.  
    
   The following figure shows how a single AAL1 stream could be 
   transported over a single PW using 1:1 cell mode. 
    
                      +----+     +---+    +-------+ 
     CBR stream 1 --->|    |---->|   |    |       |---> PW1                
     CBR stream 2 --->|AAL1|---->|ATM|--->|  1:1  |---> PW2 
     CBR stream 3 --->|    |---->|   |    | Mode  |---> PW3 
                      +----+     +---+    +-------+    
    
     Figure 2: AAL1 transport over PSN using Martini 1: 1 cell mode 
    
   In this figure CBR streams are attached to an AAL1 block. The AAL1 
   block performs the AAL1 adaptation function as specified in [ITU 
   AAL1]. The outputs of the AAL1 block contain 48-byte AAL1-PDUs. The 
   ATM block performs the ATM layer functions by adding 5-byte ATM 
   headers to the 48-byte AAL1-PDUs with proper VPI/VCI. Each AAL1 
   stream is assigned a unique VPI/VCI based on the interface that it 
   arrives to the ATM block. The ATM block then generates an ATM stream 
   toward a Martini (1:1) block, which then transports the ATM cells 
   over multiple PWs (PW1, PW2, PW3) bases on their VPI/VCI, according

   to the 1:1 cell mode of [ATM-encap]. Each IP/MPLS packet may carry 
   one or more cells belonging to the same AAL1 stream. 
    
   The AAL1 and ATM blocks could be located in the CE or in the PE. If 
   they are in CE, then the link between CE-PE is an ATM link, while if 
   they are in PE, then the link between CE-PE is a TDM link. 
    
8. AAL1 transport using PDU mode 
    
   PDU mode is an optional mode described in [ATM-encap], and is more 
   bandwidth efficient than either 1:1 and N:1 cell modes. PDU mode was 
   originally designed to carry AAL5 PDUs. However, it does not 
   prohibit using it to carry other AAL types. The technique can easily 
   be employed for other AAL types including AAL1. This is shown in 
   section 8.1. 
    
   To be fully compliant with [ATM-encap], this document also permits 
   using the PDU mode as an optional mode for transporting AAL1 traffic 
   over IP/MPLS networks. 
    
   Using PDU mode, only one AAL1 stream could be transported over a 
   single PW. Individual AAL1 streams are differentiated from each 
   other by the PW that they are carried in. In this mode, the ingress 
   PE encapsulates one or more AAL1-PDUs (Nx48 bytes) belonging to the 
   same AAL1 stream in a single packet.  
        
   The following figure shows how a single AAL1 stream could be 
   transported over a single PW using PDU mode. 
    
     
                      +----+     +---+    +-------+ 
     CBR stream 1 --->|    |---->|   |    |       |---> PW1                
     CBR stream 2 --->|AAL1|---->|ATM|--->|  PDU  |---> PW2 
     CBR stream 3 --->|    |---->|   |    |  Mode |---> PW3 
                      +----+     +---+    +-------+                        
    
            Figure 3: AAL1 transport over PSN using PDU mode 
    
   In this figure CBR streams are attached to an AAL1 block. The AAL1 
   block performs the AAL1 adaptation function as specified in [ITU 
   AAL1]. The outputs of the AAL1 block contain 48-byte AAL1-PDUs. The 
   ATM block performs the ATM layer functions by adding 5-byte ATM 
   headers to the 48-byte AAL1-PDUs with proper VPI/VCI. Each AAL1 
   stream is assigned a unique VPI/VCI based on the interface that it 
   arrives to the ATM block. The ATM block then generates an ATM stream 
   toward a Martini (PDU) block, which then transports the ATM cells 
   over multiple PWs (PW1, PW2, PW3) bases on their VPI/VCI, according 
   to the PDU mode of [ATM-encap]. Each IP/MPLS packet may carry one or 
   more cells belonging to the same AAL1 stream.

                  Transport of AAL1 frames over PSN        March 2003 
    
   The AAL1 and ATM blocks could be located in the CE or in the PE. If 
   they are in CE, then the link between CE-PE is an ATM link, while if 
   they are in PE, then the link between CE-PE is a TDM link. 
    
   It can be seen from Figure 3 that the ATM block adds the ATM header 
   to each AAL1-PDU, while Martini (PDU) block removes the ATM headers 
   and encapsulates Nx48 byte payloads (AAL1-PDUs) in to IP/MPLS 
   packet. In case the the ATM block and the Martini block are 
   implemented in a single PE device it is possible to combine them and 
   therefore reduce the required processing by eliminating the 
   add/remove ATM header operations. This concept is shown in the 
   following figure.

      Figure 4: AAL1 transport over PSN using simplified PDU mode 
    
   In this figure AAL1 streams are attached to a simplified PDU mode 
   block. This block performs all the PDU mode operations except the 
   ATM header removal. The AAL1 streams contain 48-byte AAL1-PDUs. The 
   simplified Martini (PDU) block, transports the AAL1 PDUs over 
   multiple PWs (PW1, PW2, PW3) bases on their input port, according to 
   the PDU mode of [ATM-encap]. Each IP/MPLS packet may carry one or 
   more cells belonging to the same AAL1 stream. 
    
8.1 How to use PDU mode to transport AAL1 
    
   Although PDU mode is designed to transport AAL5 frames, it does not 
   prohibit carrying other AAL type traffic. As it turns out, after a 
   small change that was made to the PDU mode by the ATM Forum, the PDU 
   mode could actually be used to carry other AAL types, including 
   AAL1. 
    
   ATM Forum noted that the current PDU mode is structured so that it 
   requires reassembly of fragments at the egress PE. However, it was 
   recognized that not only such a reassembly is not necessary, but 
   also is harmful. For example reassembling the fragments may cause 
   the OAM/RM cells to be misplaced in the stream. Also reassembly of 
   fragments would increase the cost of buffering and the overall 
   delay. These coupled with the fact that almost all implementations 
   of PDU mode don∆t actually reassemble the fragments, triggered a 
   minimal change to the PDU mode to rectify the situation. 
    
   The ATM Forum decided to change the 2-bit FRAG field in the 
   Interworking header to a Reserved bit followed by a UU-bit (Figure 
   5). The UU-bit would be copied from the MSB of the PTI of the last 
   encapsulated cell to this field. This change simplifies the egress

   processing as well as opening new opportunities, such as using the 
   PDU mode to transport other AAL types, including AAL1.  
    
   Looking at the operation of PDU mode, we would see that what it 
   actually does is to concatenate a number of 48-byte ATM payloads in 
   a packet and send it across the PSN. The concatenation would 
   terminate when either the UU bit=1 (used to indicate end of packet 
   in AAL5), or when an RM/OAM cell arrives or when the packetization 
   delay limit has exceeded. 
    
   The same procedure when applied to AAL1 stream would concatenate a 
   number of AAL1-PDUs (48-byte) in a packet and send it across the 
   PSN. The concatenation would terminate when either RM/OAM cells 
   arrive or when packetization delay limit is exceeded. Since AAL1 
   does not use the UU-bit, the UU-bit processing has no impact on it.  
    
    
   The following figure shows the format of the packet generated by PDU 
   mode (when the ATM Forum changes are reflected) for AAL1 transport.

         Figure 5: AAL1 transport over PDU encapsulation format 
        
   The first octet following the Pseudo Wire Header carries control 
   information.  The M, V, RES, U, E and C bits are defined as 
   following: 
    
   * M (Mode) bit 
     
        This bit is set to Ê1∆ to indicate the frame mode encapsulation 
    
   * V (VCI present) bit 
    
        This bit is set to Ê0∆ to indicate that no VCI is present 
    
   * RES (Reserved) bits

                  Transport of AAL1 frames over PSN        March 2003 
    
        These bits are reserved in [ATM-encap] and by default are set 
        to Ê000∆. However for the purpose of transporting AAL1 they MAY 
        be used to encode L & R values as described in section 11.1. 
        
   * UU bit   
        
   This field is used to transparently carry the UU-bit of the last 
   encapsulated cell in the packet. Since it is not used by AAL1 its 
   value would be set to Ê0∆. 
    
   * E (EFCI) bit  
        
        This field is used to convey the EFCI state of the ATM cells.  
        The EFCI state is indicated in the middle bit of each ATM 
        cell's PTI field.  
        
        ATM-to-PSN direction (ingress): The EFCI field of the control 
        byte is set to the EFCI state of the last cell of the packet.  
        
        PSN-to-ATM direction (egress): The EFCI state of all 
        constituent cells of the packet are set to the value of the 
        EFCI field in the control byte.  
        
   * C (CLP) bit  
        
        This field is used to convey the cell loss priority of the ATM 
        cells.  
        
        ATM-to-PSN direction (ingress):  The CLP field of the control 
        byte is set to Ê1∆ if any of the constituent cells of the 
        packet has its CLP bit set to Ê1∆; otherwise this field is set 
        to Ê0∆.  
        
        PSN-to-ATM direction (egress):  The CLP bit of all constituent 
        cells of a packet is set to the value of the CLP field in the 
        control byte. 
    
   As shown in figure 5, N x AAL1 PDUs (Nx48 bytes) are packed in a 
   single IP/MPLS packet to form the payload of the PW packet. The PDUs 
   are formed by removing the ATM header of arriving cells. N SHOULD be 
   either configured or negotiated between PEs based on the maximum 
   delay tolerance and maximum MTU size. 
    
    
9. Length and sequence number 
    
   PDU mode [ATM-encap] requires the inclusion of Length field for 
   links that have a minimum frame size, such as Ethernet with a 
   minimum frame size of 64 octets. The same requirement exists for 
   AAL1 transport over PDU mode. 
    
   The use of sequence number is optional in [ATM-encap]. For the 
   purpose of transporting AAL1 PDUs, here too the use of sequence 
   number is optional. However, it should be noted that since the AAL1

                  Transport of AAL1 frames over PSN        March 2003 
    
   is mainly used for CBR applications, such as circuit emulation that 
   expect in-order delivery with no loss, it is advantageous to use 
   sequence number. For example by using sequence number in the circuit 
   emulation, the receiver could detect lost packets and insert dummy 
   payload to keep the TDM frame synchronization. 
    
   The procedure for generation and processing of Length and Sequence 
   number are the same as those defined in [ATM-encap].  
    
10.     Administrative (OAM and RM) Cell Support 
    
   The treatment of OAM and RM cells is as per [ATM-encap], and depends 
   on the transport mode selected. 
    
              
11.     Defect Handling 
    
   For the purpose of detection and handling of defects that may occur 
   in the PSN, the PSN should normally have its own OAM (operation and 
   maintenance) and defect handling mechanism. These mechanisms are 
   outside the scope of this draft. 
    
   There are some defects that may occur outside of the PSN, such as 
   defects at a lower layer (e.g. Physical layer LOS) between CE-PE. 
   These defects are detected by other means than PSN OAM. When such 
   defect happens, the PE SHOULD generate ATM F5 AIS on all affected 
   VCs according to [ATM-encap].  
    
   When an ingress PE cannot support the generation of F5 OAM cells 
   upon reception of a corresponding F4 AIS or lower layer defect (such 
   as LOS), it MAY notify the egress PE by setting the L-bit (as 
   defined below) in the control byte to indicate that a defect exist 
   at a lower layer (i.e., Physical layer) in the ATM-to-PSN direction. 
   In such defect conditions, the packet payload is meaningless. For 
   bandwidth saving purpose, the IP/MPLS packets MAY be send with 
   minimum PSN payload set to all zeros. 
    
   For AAL1 services, loss of packets is an important defect that MAY 
   be detected and reported. Loss of packet could be due to 
   connectivity failure of congestion. In either case Egress PE MAY use 
   sequence number in the control word (figure 1) to detect packet 
   loss. Upon detection of such a packet loss the egress PE MAY inform 
   the ingress PE by setting the R-bit (as defined below) in the 
   control byte to indicate a packet loss. The ingress PE could use 
   that information to shut down or reroute the PW. Loss of 
   connectivity MAY alternatively be detected independently using PSN 
   specific OAM mechanisms.   
    
11.1    L & R bits 
    
   3 bits are reserved (RESV bits) in [ATM-encap] (assuming ATM Forum 
   change on PDU mode has been accepted) for future use. [ATM-encap] 
   requires that these bits be set to zero at ingress PE and ignored at

   reception. This draft proposes encoding the forward and backward 
   defect identifiers in two of these reserved bits as following. 
    
   L-bit: Forward defect identifier. L-bit is the left hand bit of the 
   RESV field in the control byte. It MAY be set when a failure happens 
   in a lower layer between CE-PE and the ingress PE cannot support the 
   generation of OAM cells upon reception of a corresponding F4 AIS or 
   lower layer defect (such as LOS). It SHOULD be cleared when those 
   failures are rectified. 
    
   R-bit: Backward defect identifier. R-bit is the right hand bit of 
   the RESV field in the control byte. It MAY be set after a PE detects 
   loss of a pre-configured number of packets in a certain interval. 
   And it should be cleared after reception without loss of a pre-
   configured number of packets.  
    
   The PEs that can∆t or don∆t want to encode L or R bits in the RESV 
   field will set them to Ê0∆ as per [ATM-encap]. The PEs that can∆t 
   interpret the L or R bits will ignore the RESV field as per [ATM-
   encap]. These rules insure backward compatibility with equipments 
   that have already been developed based on PDU mode. The following 
   figure shows the encoding of L & R bits.

12.     QoS consideration 
    
   Since AAL1 is predominantly used to transport real-time CBR data, 
   such as TDM traffic, it is recommended to provision enough BW to 
   carry the AAL1 traffic. In case Diffserv is used it is recommended 
   to use a virtual wire kind of PDB to transport the AAL1 PDUs over 
   the PSN.
