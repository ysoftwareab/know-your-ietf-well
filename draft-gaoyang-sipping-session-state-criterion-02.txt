Abstract

   There is debate on the topic of "Commit/Rollback of Offer/Answer on
   Unsuccessful re-INVITE".  The reason of the confusion is some
   application/session usages of offer/answer imply the nest
   transaction(mean transaction theory, not mean sip transaction)
   concept, but whitout unambiguous definition.  This paper reveal the
   concept of nest transactions in current RFC and other well known
   application/session usages.  And then clarify that there is no
   ambiguous state of session modification using current RFC definition.

1.  Introduction

   In this paper, a solution of session state is proposed, which uses
   the concept of nested-transaction.  As there has been some proposed
   solutions, then why a new one?  The reasons are:

   o current proposed solutions have some drawback.

   o we should using nested-transaction for session state, because it is
   the natural property of session modification.

2.  Drawback of current proposed solutions

   I collected two types of such solutions from discussion and other
   open way, such as drafts.

   o commit by Offer/Answer.

   o "manual rollback".

2.1.  Drawbacks of commit by Offer/Answer

2.1.1.  Intuitionistic drawback

   As mentioned in RFC3311: UPDATE needs to be answered immediately,
   ruling out the possibility of user approval.  Such approval will
   frequently be needed, and is possible with a re-INVITE.

   It reveal the main difference of Re-INVITE and UPDATE.  If we can not
   clarify the session state on unsuccessful re-INVITE, we just give up
   the advantages of Re-INVITE.  And will just make Re-INVITE as UPDATE.
   And we may ask: Why we need Re-INVITE further while modification of
   session using Re-INVITE is just as the one using UPDATE?

2.1.2.  Confirmed state but not enough for usage

   Considering such situation: One side using Re-INVITE to reduce the
   number of media types, such as audio and vedio session to audio
   session, or to use codec needing less resources.  There are Offer/
   Answer pairs before the final response of Re-INVITE.  At last, the
   other side reject the modification.

   If we obey the rule "session parameters that have been sucessfully
   changed during the re-INVITE transaction MUST remain unchanged", the
   media types or resources are not enough for the user.

   Even if user sends a new Re-INVITE to reopen the media types, but
   there is not enough media types or resources during this new Re-
   INVITE and it violates the continuity of session usage.  For advanced
   media type, such as virtual reality pursuing immersion for users, it
   will be terrible.

2.1.3.  Useless pending state

   Reasons, such as precondition, can make the session state in pending
   state.  And if the preconidtion is not met, the two sides can not use
   the resources.  And it also violates the continuity of session usage.

Internet-Draft       The Criterion of Session State        February 2009


2.1.4.  Illegal using session parameters

   The modification in media level can be used illegally, while the
   modification is unsuccessful in signal level.

2.2.  Drawback of manual rollback

2.2.1.  Problems for ordinary SDP

   Sections mentioned above introduced "manual rollback" using a new Re-
   INVITE as the way to resume the session under ambiguous situations.
   But if the two sides have no consistent view of session state, no
   matter which side sends the new Re-INVITE, the other side will treat
   it as violation of session continuity because of different view of
   session state.

2.2.2.  Problems for non-integrative SDP

   Because the SDP just describes part of the session, not all aspects
   of the session.  It must be combined with the previous one(or ones)
   to show the effects, as the formula:

   "current session state" = "previous session state" + "modification
   session description".

   Even if using a new Re-INVITE with "modification session
   description", we can not rebulid the "current session state" without
   the definition of the "previous session state".  So, the "previous
   session state" is important here, and we still need to give out a
   precise definition of session state to get the "previous session
   state" here.

3.  Why nested transaction

   Chapter 2 reveals the necessity of a new solution for session state.
   And this chapter is about why the new solution is based on the
   concept of nested-transaction.

3.1.  Nested transaction concept in current RFCs

3.1.1.  Precondition

   As RFC3312(Quality-of-Service precondition)\4032(Precondition
   Framework)\5027(Security Preconditions) defines, session
   establishment and modification suspended until precondtion is
   satisfied.  And during the suspended state, there can be Offer/Answer
   pairs used as precondition notification.

   This is a typical nested transaction using Offer/Answer pairs as sub-
   transaction.

3.1.2.  Late commitment of Re-INVITE 200OK

   As RFC3261 defines, for unsuccessful Re-INVITE, the session
   parameters MUST remain unchanged, as if no re-INVITE had been issued.
   This is about session modification triggered by Re-INVITE.  And the
   "Late commitment of Re-INVITE 200OK" just corresponds to the
   modification triggered by the Re-INVITE.  A new modification during
   the Re-INVITE has nothing to do with the final response of Re-INVITE,
   such as UPDATE with a new modification.

   This is also a typical nested transaction using Offer/Answer pair as
   sub-transaction.  And it is intuitionistic requirement for rejecting
   session modification.

   What MUST be pointed out is that, by RFC3262, Offer/Answer of the
   modification triggered by Re-INVITE can be exchanged before final
   response.  In signal level, the modification is in pending state and
   waits for late commitment.  But in media level, the new session
   parameters can be used.  And this obeys RFC3264 and RFC3262.

3.2.  Opened for evolution and extension in the future

   We should accept the idea that using offer/answer as sub-transaction
   of modification should be open for the future extension.  For
   example, in the future we can define a complex application which need
   negotiation of session parameter using more than one offer/answer
   pairs for one modification, just like "Precondition".

   As nested transaction is the natural property of session modification

   and it is important for evolution and extension in the future, so the
   new solution is based on the concept of nested-transaction.

4.  The Criterion

4.1.  Explanation for current nested-transaction usages

4.1.1.  Rules for current nested-transaction usages

   "Late commitment of Re-INVITE 200OK" contains "Precondition".  And
   that is "Precondition" can be sub-transaction of "Late commitment of
   Re-INVITE 200OK" to form a bigger nested-transaction.  And this is
   practical for session modification with precondition using Re-INVITE.

   Rule 1: Late commitment of the modification triggered by Re-INVITE is
   200OK.  Before the 200OK, the modification is in pending state in the
   point of view of signal level.  If the Re-INVITE is unsuccessful, the
   pending modification MUST rollback.

   Rule 2: Precondition notification is part of the original
   modification.

   Rule 3: when a new modification succeeds during the pending state of
   the previous modification, the new one MUST be committed and the
   original one discarded.

   Rule 4: when a new modification request is rejected during the
   pending state of the previous modification, the original one can go
   on.

4.1.2.  Explanation for some concepts

4.1.2.1.  What is a precondition notification?

   Concluded from RFC3312:

   o Suspending/resuming of session modification is session level issue,
   so any m-lines with precondition will make session suspended.

   o An Offer/Answer with precondition notification and without any
   other modification of session, during suspending state of session
   modification, is called precondition notification.

   o An Offer/Answer with any other modification of session beyond
   precondition notification will make the Offer/Answer a new
   modification.

   o An Offer/Answer with precondition notification and without any
   other modification of session, but after suspending state of session
   modification MUST NOT be treated as precondition notification
   anymore.

Internet-Draft       The Criterion of Session State        February 2009


4.1.2.2.  What is s new modification request?

   Any new version of SDP can be treated as new modification, if there
   is no specific definition to make it a part of the original one.

   During a Re-INVITE, one side can send the same SDP with higer version
   number in UPDATE, for emergency reasons.  The situation is unusual
   but legal.  And if the other side accept the modification, it will be
   effective at once.  So, it MUST be treated as a new modification.
   The same is for the Offer/Answer with precondition notification and
   without any other modification of session, but after suspending state
   of session modification.

4.2.  Rules in academic way

   Current usage is simple, and the discription mentioned in chapter 4.1
   is just about "Precondition" and "Late commitment of Re-INVITE
   200OK".  And to be reference for complex evolution and extension, we
   need more academic and abstract rules.

   o Rule 1: transactins and smaller nested-transactions can be taken as
   sub-transaction of a bigger nested-transaction.  And this forms
   cascade level of transactions.  We call the nested-transaction as
   "higer hevel" and its sub-transaction as "lower level".

   o Rule 2: considering the integrity, we define "Session Modification"
   as the root of any nested transaction.  When the highest level sub-
   transaction in "Session Modification" committed, "Session
   Modification" commits.

   With the root nested transaction, any high level nested transaction
   is just the root's sub-transaction.  And introducing new higher level
   of nested transaction would not make violation of the cascade level
   of transactions.

   o Rule 3: when nested transaction failed, it MUST rollback by
   discarding its committed sub-transactions.

   o Rule 4: when a higer or the same Level transaction succeeded during
   the pending state of a lower or the same level transaction, the new
   one MUST be committed and the original one discarded.

   o Rule 5: when a higer or the same Level transaction request is
   rejected during the pending state of a lower or the same level
   transaction, the original one can go on.

   F7 is the important one: if it is 200OK with answer, it means that
   UAS accept the new modification.  And in session level it is the new
   modification after the one trigged by Re-INVITE, so we have no reason
   to say that the the new successful modification should be commited by
   the signal(2XX of Re-INVITE) associate to the original modification
   request.And in signal level, Re-INVITE and UPDATE is independent
   transaction(SIP).As the new modification has been committed and its
   state have nothing to do whit F8, the session state is clear.

   Considering the UAS has the local policy that new modification must

   notify the user, it must send 504 to reject F6.

   The confusing is because of some people hypotheses the relation of
   UPDATE and Re-INVITE.  As the new modification have been committed,
   the original session state without committing should be discarded.

5.3.  Racing condition free

   As the new modification has been committed and its state have nothing
   to do with F8, the problem of racing condition(200OK of Re-INVITE and
   UPDATE) described in 6.2 of "draft-ietf-sipping-sip-offeranswer" does
   not exist.

                                 Figure 3

   Currently, there are only two cases for the Offer in UPDATE:

   o precondtion notification;

   o a new modification request.

   If it is precondtion notification, the session state is clear.  That
   is committed state of the modification triggered by F1.

Internet-Draft       The Criterion of Session State        February 2009


   If it is a new modification request, there are only two cases for the
   UPDATE:

   o accepted by 200OK;

   o rejected by 4xx/5xx/6xx, such as 504.

   If it is accepted by 200OK, the new modification is committed.  And
   the session state is committed state of the modification triggered by
   F5.

   If it is rejected, the previous modification will go on.  And session
   state is committed state of the modification triggered by F1.

   So, the session state is clear for this situation.  And the solution
   is racing condition free.
