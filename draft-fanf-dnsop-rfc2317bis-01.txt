Internet-Draft      Classless reverse DNS delegation       November 2015


1.  Introduction

   Since the introduction of classless inter-domain routing (CIDR), it
   has become common to assign IPv4 address space on non-octet
   boundaries.  This memo describes how to do IN-ADDR.ARPA delegation on
   any non-octet boundary.  There are two complementary methods, using
   CNAME records for long prefixes (greater than 24 bits) and using
   DNAME records for shorter prefixes.

   The CNAME method (Section 4) makes it possible to assign IP address
   blocks with prefixes longer than 24 bits, covering fewer than 256
   addresses, without losing the ability to delegate authority for the
   corresponding IN-ADDR.ARPA mappings.  This method is fully compatible
   with the original DNS lookup mechanisms specified in [RFC1034], i.e.
   there is no need to modify the lookup algorithm used, and there
   should be no need to modify any software which does DNS lookups.

   For shorter prefixes IN-ADDR.ARPA space is usually delegated on octet
   boundaries, which can lead to a proliferation of zones, for instance
   a /17 assignment requires 128 delegations.  The DNAME method
   (Section 6) makes it possible to reduce the number of zones to match
   the number of address space assignments.  Although DNAME records
   [RFC6672] are an extension to the original DNS specification, they
   are sufficiently widely supported to make this method feasible.
   There is a discussion of DNAME deployment considerations in [RFC7535]
   section 6.

   These methods can also be used to consolidate multiple address blocks
   into a single DNS zone.  (Section 8.)  This reduces the
   administrative overhead of managing delegations; for instance it
   reduces the need to update DS records when DNSSEC keys are rolled.

   While these methods interoperate well with DNS resolvers, they
   require some care from dynamic DNS UPDATE clients that are trying to
   change IN-ADDR.ARPA mappings.  The client needs to follow the CNAME
   and/or DNAME redirections so that its UPDATE request changes the
   canonical PTR record without disrupting the redirections.
   (Section 9.)

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Examples use the "example" special-use domain name [RFC6761], the
   example networks 192.0.2.0/24 [RFC5735] and 2001:db8::/32 [RFC5156],
   and to illustrate shorter prefixes, the private network 10.0.0.0/8

   [RFC1918].


2.  DNS master file $GENERATE directive

   The examples in this memo are written using DNS master file syntax as
   specified in [RFC1035] section 5.  Some examples use the $GENERATE
   extension, which allows you to generate multiple resource records
   based on a numeric range and a template.  The $GENERATE extension is
   well-known but it is not supported by all DNS master file readers.

   The syntax of the $GENERATE directive is:

     $GENERATE range domain [ttl] [class] type rdata [comment]

   The directive and numeric range are followed by a template resource
   record.  The ttl, class, type, and comment fields are in standard
   master file format.

   The range is a pair of unsigned decimal numbers separated by a "-",
   and the left-hand (first) number is less than or equal to the right-
   hand (last) number.  The $GENERATE directive expands an instance of
   the template for each number in the range including both endpoints.

     range  =  1*DIGIT "-" 1*DIGIT  ; first-last

   The owner domain of the template is a normal domain name, except that
   where "$" occurs it is replaced by the generated number.  A literal
   "$" can be included by escaping it with a backslash, like "\$", or
   doubling it, like "$$".

   The rdata is expanded in the same way as the domain.  If the rdata
   includes white space (as in MX records, for example) then the whole
   rdata must be quoted.  If the rdata needs to be quoted, then it must
   be quoted twice.

     $GENERATE 0-1 $.text.example. TXT "\"slightly arcane\""

   Extended versions of the $GENERATE directive allow you to modify a
   substitution by following the "$" with a clause in braces like
   "${...}".  These modifiers are not described here.

   For example, you can use the $GENERATE directive to populate the
   reverse zone for a DHCP pool like this:

     $ORIGIN 2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.
     $GENERATE 1-254 $ PTR dhcp-$.example.com.

Internet-Draft      Classless reverse DNS delegation       November 2015


   This expands to:

     $ORIGIN 2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.
     1               PTR        dhcp-1.example.com.
     2               PTR        dhcp-2.example.com.
     ; ... 250 more records ...
     253             PTR        dhcp-253.example.com.
     254             PTR        dhcp-254.example.com.


3.  Motivation

   One of the problems encountered when assigning address space with a
   longer prefix (fewer addresses) is that it seems impossible for the
   user of the address space to maintain their own reverse ("IN-
   ADDR.ARPA") zone autonomously.  This obstacle can be overcome using
   the reverse delegation method described below.

   Let us assume we have assigned the address spaces to three different
   parties as follows:

     192.0.2.0/25   to organization A
     192.0.2.128/26 to organization B
     192.0.2.192/26 to organization C

   In the classical approach, this would lead to a single zone like
   this:

     $ORIGIN 2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.
     ;
     1               PTR     host1.A.example.
     2               PTR     host2.A.example.
     3               PTR     host3.A.example.
     ;
     129             PTR     host1.B.example.
     130             PTR     host2.B.example.
     131             PTR     host3.B.example.
     ;
     193             PTR     host1.C.example.
     194             PTR     host2.C.example.
     195             PTR     host3.C.example.

   The administration of this zone is problematic.  Authority for this
   zone can only be delegated once, and this usually translates into
   "this zone can only be administered by one organization."  The other
   organizations with address space that corresponds to entries in this
   zone would thus have to depend on another organization for their
   address to name translation.  This potential problem can be avoided

   using the method described in this memo.


4.  Classless IN-ADDR.ARPA delegation for long prefixes

   This section describes classless IN-ADDR.ARPA delegation for prefix
   lengths between /25 and /31 inclusive.

   Since a single zone (such as 2.0.192.in-addr.arpa) can only be
   delegated once, we need more delegation points to solve our problem.
   An extra delegation point can be introduced by extending the IN-
   ADDR.ARPA tree downwards, by adding a label that is not entirely
   numeric so it does not clash with the existing reverse DNS names.

   For each /24 subdivided up using this method, there are 256 CNAME
   records in the parent zone pointing into the child zones via these
   extra delegation points.  It is quite easy to automatically generate
   the CNAME resource records in the parent zone once and for all, after
   you know the way the address space is partitioned.

   Continuing the motivating example given in Section 3, here is how you
   can divide a /24 into a /25 and two /26 ranges.

     $ORIGIN 2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.
     @       IN      SOA     ns0.isp.example. ( ... )
     ; ...
     ;
     0-127           NS      ns1.A.example.
     0-127           NS      ns2.A.example.
     ;
     $GENERATE 0-127 $ CNAME $.0-127
     ;
     128-191         NS      ns1.B.example.
     128-191         NS      ns2.B.example.
     ;
     $GENERATE 128-191 $ CNAME $.128-191
     ;
     192-255         NS      ns1.C.example.
     192-255         NS      ns2.C.example.
     ;
     $GENERATE 192-255 $ CNAME $.192-255

   In this example the extra delegation points are named after the
   bottom and top addresses in the delegated address range, using the
   same format as the $GENERATE range specifier.

   The $GENERATE directives produce 256 CNAME records which when
   expanded look like:

     42.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.  CNAME  42.0-127.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.

   The child zones might look something like:

     $ORIGIN 0-127.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.
     @       IN      SOA     ns0.A.example. ( ... )
                     NS      ns1.A.example.
                     NS      ns2.A.example.
     ;
     1               PTR     host1.A.example.
     2               PTR     host2.A.example.
     3               PTR     host3.A.example.


     $ORIGIN 128-191.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.
     @       IN      SOA     ns0.B.example. ( ... )
                     NS      ns1.B.example.
                     NS      ns2.B.example.
     ;
     129             PTR     host1.B.example.
     130             PTR     host2.B.example.
     131             PTR     host3.B.example.


     $ORIGIN 192-255.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.
     @       IN      SOA     ns0.C.example. ( ... )
                     NS      ns1.C.example.
                     NS      ns2.C.example.
     ;
     193             PTR     host1.C.example.
     194             PTR     host2.C.example.
     195             PTR     host3.C.example.

   When a client does a reverse DNS query for an IP address in this
   range, it will get an answer like this:

     ;; QUESTION SECTION:
     ;42.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.  IN  PTR

     ;; ANSWER SECTION:

5.  IN-ADDR.ARPA delegation for individual addresses

   This section describes IN-ADDR.ARPA delegation for prefix lengths of
   /32, that is, individual IP addresses.

   The CNAME trick described in the previous section is not necessary
   when delegating the reverse DNS for an individual IP address.
   Instead you can delegate at the reverse DNS name itself (for example,
   delegate at 42.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa), and put the PTR record at the
   apex of the delegated zone.

   In detail (not continuing the previous examples), say isp.example has
   delegated the reverse DNS for 192.0.2.42/32 to their customer
   K.example:

     $ORIGIN 2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.
     @       IN      SOA     ns0.isp.example. ( ... )
     ; ...
     42              NS      ns1.K.example.
     42              NS      ns2.K.example.
     ; ...

   The delegated zone will only have a few records at its apex:

     $ORIGIN 42.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.
     @       IN      SOA     ns0.K.example. ( ... )
                     NS      ns1.K.example.
                     NS      ns2.K.example.
                     PTR     host42.K.example.

   The CNAME method described in Section 4 is in fact not necessary.
   You can delegate the reverse DNS for a CIDR address block by setting
   up delegations and /32 zones for every address in the block.  However
   it is usually simpler to set up a single delegated zone and an
   automatically-generated set of CNAME records.


6.  Classless IN-ADDR.ARPA delegation for short prefixes

   This section describes classless IN-ADDR.ARPA delegation for prefix
   lengths between /9 and /23 inclusive, except for /16 which falls on
   an octet boundary.

   Just as you can replace lots of /32 zones with one CIDR zone and some
   CNAME records, you can replace lots of /24 or /16 zones with one CIDR
   zone and some DNAME records.  It is equally easy to set up, though
   the way it works is a bit more complicated.

Internet-Draft      Classless reverse DNS delegation       November 2015


   DNAME records are described in [RFC6672], but here is a very terse
   summary.  Whereas a CNAME record acts as a redirect for its owner
   name, a DNAME record acts as a redirect for descendents of its owner
   name, but not the name itself.  Whereas a wildcard CNAME redirects a
   subtree of the DNS namespace to a single target name, a DNAME
   redirects a subtree to corresponding names in a different subtree.

   Say, for example, that two organizations A and B want to share
   10.0.0.0/8, one using the bottom half and the other using the top
   half.  But they would each prefer not to have to manage 128 master
   zones of their own and 128 secondary zones from their counterpart.

   They can reduce this from 256 zones (one for each /16) to 2 zones
   (one for each /9) by setting up the parent zone like this:

     $ORIGIN 10.in-addr.arpa.
     @       IN      SOA     ns0.B.example. ( ... )
     ; ...
     ;
     0-127           NS      ns1.A.example.
     0-127           NS      ns2.A.example.
     ;
     $GENERATE 0-127 $ DNAME $.0-127
     ;
     128-255         NS      ns1.B.example.
     128-255         NS      ns2.B.example.
     ;
     $GENERATE 128-255 $ DNAME $.128-255

   The $GENERATE directives produce 256 DNAME records which when
   expanded look like:

     2.10.in-addr.arpa.  DNAME  2.0-127.10.in-addr.arpa.

   This DNAME record has the effect of mapping names under 2.10.in-
   addr.arpa to corresponding names under 2.0-127.10.in-addr.arpa, like
   this:

     4.3.2.10.in-addr.arpa  ->  4.3.2.0-127.10.in-addr.arpa

   The child zones will look something like,

     $ORIGIN 0-127.10.in-addr.arpa.
     @       IN      SOA     ns0.A.example. ( ... )
                     NS      ns1.A.example.
                     NS      ns2.A.example.
     ;
     4.3.2           PTR     host4.A.example. ; 10.2.3.4

     ;
     20.100.200      PTR     host20.B.example. ; 10.200.100.20

   When a client does a reverse DNS query for an IP address in this
   range, it will get an answer containing a DNAME record, a synthesized
   CNAME record, and the canonical answer:

   (TTL and CLASS omitted to save space.)


7.  Alternative naming conventions

   In the sections above, we have suggested naming CIDR subdomains using
   the same notation as $GENERATE ranges, first-last.  However the
   choice of name is just convention, and you are free to use a
   different convention if that is more convenient for you.

7.1.  Subnet base slash prefix length (a bad idea)

   In its main example, the predecessor to this memo [RFC2317] suggested
   using the subnet's first address and prefix length separated by a
   slash, for instance,

     $ORIGIN 2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.
     129     CNAME   129.128/26.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.

   One problem with putting a slash in the zone name is that it is
   common to give zone master files the same name as the zone they
   describe; this is troublesome if the zone name includes a directory
   separator.

   In fact, [RFC2317] went on to say this convention is a bad idea.  The
   remainder of this section quotes the paragraphs that explain why you
   should not follow this example:

   Some DNS implementations are not kind to special characters in domain

   names, e.g. the "/" used in the above examples.  As [RFC2181] makes
   clear, these are legal, though some might feel unsightly.  Because
   these are not host names the restriction of [RFC0952] does not apply.
   Modern clients and servers have an option to act in the liberal and
   correct fashion.

   The examples here use "/" because it was felt to be more visible and
   pedantic reviewers felt that the 'these are not hostnames' argument
   needed to be repeated.  We advise you not to be so pedantic, and to
   not precisely copy the above examples, e.g. substitute a more
   conservative character, such as hyphen, for "/".

7.2.  Subnet base hyphen prefix length

   The sensible version of the [RFC2317] convention is to use the
   subnet's first address and prefix length separated by a hyphen, for
   instance,

     $ORIGIN 2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.
     129     CNAME   129.128-26.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.

   This convention has the advantage of matching the way that address
   assignments are configured for routing.  However the first-last
   convention is able to use a single DNS delegation covering adjacent
   CIDR blocks; for instance, a /25 and an adjacent /26 can be covered
   by a single delegation for 0-191.

7.3.  Subnet base only (a bad idea)

   Another alternative mentioned in [RFC2317] is the subnet's first
   address by itself.

   With this convention, most addresses in the subnet have a CNAME (as
   in Section 4), but the subnet base address does not and instead looks
   like a /32 delegation (as in Section 5).

   Because of its lack of uniformity we discourage you from using this
   convention.

7.4.  Customer ID

   It is not necessary for the subdomain to be tied to an address range;
   it could instead be a customer name or other ID.  Then if that
   customer's address allocation changes, their provider can just add or
   remove CNAME or DNAME records without having to change the
   delegation.

   This convention can also be useful if two organizations somehow share

   the same physical subnet (and corresponding IP address space) with no
   "neat" split between the allocations, but they still want to
   administrate their own IN-ADDR.ARPA mappings.

7.5.  In the forward DNS tree

   The CNAME or DNAME records do not have to point into a subdomain: it
   is also possible to point to an entirely different part of the DNS
   tree, that is, outside of the IN-ADDR.ARPA tree.  This variant of our
   running example might look like,

     $ORIGIN 2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.
     @       IN      SOA     ns0.isp.example. ( ... )
     ; ...
     $GENERATE 0-127   $ CNAME $.A.example.
     $GENERATE 128-191 $ CNAME $.B.example.
     $GENERATE 192-255 $ CNAME $.C.example.

     $ORIGIN A.example.
     @       IN      SOA     ns0.A.example. ( ... )
     ; ...
     ;
     host1           A       192.0.2.1
     1               PTR     host1
     ;
     host2           A       192.0.2.2
     2               PTR     host2
     ;
     ; ...

   This way you can actually end up with the name -> address and the
   (pointed-to) address -> name mapping data in the same zone file.  The
   two mutually inverse mappings can be updated in the same DNS UPDATE
   transaction (though this benefit should not be exaggerated: the
   records will be still be cached separately and will time out
   independently).  Do however note that the resolver's traversal via
   the IN-ADDR.ARPA tree will still be done, so the CNAME records
   inserted there need to point to the right place for this to work.


8.  Consolidated reverse DNS zones

   This section describes how to reduce the number of reverse DNS
   delegations.  It applies to any prefix length, and can be used for
   IPv6 as well as IPv4.

   Section 7.5 suggests setting up DNAME and/or CNAME records to point
   from the reverse DNS tree to the forward DNS.  A significant

Internet-Draft      Classless reverse DNS delegation       November 2015


   advantage of this is that it eliminates a delegation: instead of
   having to agree on a CIDR subdomain name, an NS RRset, and a DS
   RRset, and keep these up-to-date as name servers and DNSSEC keys
   change, you only need to agree on a target consolidation domain name.

   The convention we recommend is to lay out part of your forward DNS
   namespace in the same way as the standard reverse DNS.  That is, set
   up an "in-addr" subdomain under which you place PTR records for
   reversed dotted-quad IPv4 addresses, and/or an "ip6" subdomain under
   which you place PTR records for reversed exploded IPv6 addresses.
   This allows you to consolidate the reverse DNS for multiple disparate
   address blocks into the same zone.  (You can have separate
   consolidation zones for IPv4 and IPv6, and for public and private
   addresses.)

   For example, say organization A decides to consolidate their reverse
   zones.  They would set up their forward DNS like this:

     $ORIGIN A.example.
     @               IN      SOA     ns0.A.example. ( ... )
     ; ...
     ;
     1.2.0.192.in-addr       PTR     host1
     2.2.0.192.in-addr       PTR     host2
     4.3.2.10.in-addr        PTR     host4

   For long prefixes like 192.0.2.0/25, organization A asks their
   provider to point CNAME records at their consolidation domain under
   A.example, like this:

     $ORIGIN 2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.
     ; ...
     $GENERATE 0-127 $ CNAME $.2.0.192.in-addr.A.example.

   For short prefixes like 10.0.0.0/9, organization A asks their
   provider to point DNAME records at their consolidation domain under
   A.example, like this:

     $ORIGIN 10.in-addr.arpa.
     ; ...
     $GENERATE 0-127 $ DNAME $.10.in-addr.A.example.

   Similarly, for its IPv6 network 2001:db8:A::/48, organization A again
   asks for a DNAME record, like this:

     $ORIGIN 8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.
     ; ...
     A.0.0.0   DNAME   A.0.0.0.8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.A.example.

Internet-Draft      Classless reverse DNS delegation       November 2015


   To get the full benefit of a consolidated reverse zone, DNAME records
   should be used instead of delegations.  However this requires co-
   operation from the provider of the address space.

   Instead of inserting DNAME records in the provider's reverse DNS
   zone, you can add delegations on octet boundaries as usual, and put
   DNAME records at the apex of the delegated zones.  (Unlike CNAMEs,
   DNAMEs do not conflict with other records at the same name.)  This
   makes the reverse zones small and static, which is a small advantage,
   though it does not avoid the other overheads of managing a
   delegation.


9.  Dynamic DNS UPDATE for reverse DNS pointers

   This section updates the DNS UPDATE specification [RFC2136].  It
   specifies additional requirements for DNS UPDATE clients, so they can
   dynamically change reverse DNS records in a way that is compatible
   with the techniques described in the previous sections.  It applies
   both to the IPv4 reverse DNS under IN-ADDR.ARPA and the IPv6 reverse
   DNS under IP6.ARPA.

   These additional requirements only apply to DNS UPDATE clients that
   wish to add, remove, or change endpoint records in the reverse DNS.
   These requirements do not apply if you are using DNS UPDATE for other
   purposes, such as altering zone apex or delegation records, or CNAME
   or DNAME records - which you need to do if you are using DNS UPDATE
   to deploy classless IN-ADDR.ARPA delegations.  These requirements do
   not affect uses of DNS UPDATE outside the IN-ADDR.ARPA and IP6.ARPA
   sub-trees.

   In this section, we use the term "reverse DNS query name" to mean a
   name under IN-ADDR.ARPA or IP6.ARPA which a resolver uses when making
   a reverse DNS query.  The resolver expects this name to resolve to a
   PTR RRset or other endpoint records, but (as described in previous
   sections) the query name does not have to be the direct owner of the
   endpoint records but can instead be an alias.

   We use the term "endpoint records" as a generalization of the PTR
   RRset, since the reverse DNS can include other information about an
   IP address - not just its host name.  For instance, the EUI48 and
   EUI64 RRtypes are intended for mapping from IP addresses to MAC
   addresses [RFC7043].

   The problem addressed by this section is that DNS UPDATE clients
   sometimes use a reverse DNS query name in an UPDATE message without
   checking for CNAME or DNAME redirections.  If the usual reverse DNS
   query name is an alias, then this behavior results in an attempt to



Finch                     Expires May 13, 2016                 [Page 14]

Internet-Draft      Classless reverse DNS delegation       November 2015


   add or delete an endpoint record to or from a node that already
   contains the CNAME record, and the update fails.

   Aside:  Presumably the UPDATE will also fail if the node is occluded
      below a DNAME record, but neither [RFC2136] nor [RFC6672]
      specifies how a server ought to react to attempts to UPDATE an
      occluded domain name.

9.1.  Requirements for updating PTR records in the reverse DNS

   When updating a endpoint records in the reverse DNS, an UPDATE client
   SHOULD NOT simply convert the IP address to a reverse DNS query name
   and send an UPDATE request for the records at that name.  It MUST NOT
   assume the zone cut falls on a particular boundary such as /24 for
   IPv4 or /64 for IPv6.

   Instead, the UPDATE client SHOULD canonicalize all reverse DNS query
   names that it uses in its UPDATE message.  It MUST ensure that all
   the canonical names are within the same zone and that the ZNAME field
   in the UPDATE message refers to this zone.

9.2.  Suggested behaviour

   In the absence of more specific configuration, a reverse DNS UPDATE
   client can follow this procedure.

   Send a SOA query for the reverse DNS query name.  There are four
   kinds of useful response.

   o  There is a SOA record at the query name, which is returned in the
      answer section of the response.  This can occur if the name has a
      /32 delegation.

   o  The query name is an alias for a name with a SOA record.  The
      answer section of the response contains a CNAME chain and a SOA
      record.

   o  The query name is not an alias.  The response is NOERROR or
      NXDOMAIN.  The answer section is empty, and the authority record
      contains a SOA record.  This is the traditionally expected result.

   o  The query name is an alias.  The response is NOERROR or NXDOMAIN.
      The answer section has a CNAME chain, and the authority record
      contains a SOA record.  This is the normal case for classless IN-
      ADDR.ARPA delegations or consolidated reverse DNS.

   In other cases there has been some kind of problem and the DNS UPDATE
   cannot proceed.



Finch                     Expires May 13, 2016                 [Page 15]

Internet-Draft      Classless reverse DNS delegation       November 2015


   (Note that if the reverse DNS query name is under a DNAME, the
   response will contain a DNAME in the answer section and a synthesized
   CNAME.  The UPDATE client can ignore the DNAME and just use the CNAME
   records.)

   (There can also be other records in the response, but they are not
   relevant to this procedure and so are not discussed here.)

   All of the useful responses give the DNS UPDATE client enough
   information to construct a correct UPDATE message.

   o  The server to send the UPDATE message to comes from the SOA MNAME
      field.

   o  The UPDATE ZNAME comes from the owner name of the SOA record.

   o  The canonical name of the endpoint records comes from the final
      target of the CNAME chain, or the QNAME if there are no CNAME
      records in the answer.


10.  Operational considerations

10.1.  Secondary name service

   Very old name server software might not find and return the target
   name in CNAME records if the targte name is not already known locally
   as cached or as authoritative data.  This can cause some confusion in
   stub resolvers, as only the CNAME record will be returned in the
   response.  To avoid this problem it is recommended that the
   authoritative name servers for the delegating zone (the zone
   containing all the CNAME or DNAME records) all run as secondary name
   servers for the target zones delegated and pointed into via the
   CNAME/DNAME records.

10.2.  CNAME chains

   Multiple levels of delegation using the methods described in this
   memo lead to multi-step CNAME and/or DNAME chains.  Although
   [RFC1034] requires resolvers to handle CNAME chains robustly, such a
   setup might be less reliable overall.

10.3.  Mail servers

   SMTP servers are often very picky about reverse DNS, and some are
   known to be intolerant of DNAME records.  Therefore it is wise to be
   wary of deploying the methods described in Section 6 and Section 8
   for IP address ranges that contain outgoing inter-domain mail

Internet-Draft      Classless reverse DNS delegation       November 2015


   senders.

10.4.  Workaround for DNS UPDATE interoperability problems

   If you have the problem described in Section 9 because your reverse
   DNS UPDATE client does not follow the new requirements in that
   section, you might be able to work around it by using /32 delegations
   as described in Section 5.  This allows you to eliminate the CNAME
   records used by the normal classless delegation method (Section 4) at
   the cost of requiring more zones.  And with /32 delegations, the
   canonical owner name of the PTR records is the usual reverse DNS
   query name, so the UPDATE client does not need to chase CNAME chains.


11.  Security Considerations

11.1.  Classless delegation

   With this scheme, the "leaf sites" might need to rely on one more
   site running their DNS name service correctly than they would be if
   they had a /24 allocation of their own, and this might add an extra
   component which will need to work for reliable name resolution.

11.2.  Consolidated reverse zones

   Normal reverse DNS delegations and classless delegations require more
   frequent changes when zones are signed for DNSSEC [RFC4033], to
   update the DS records in the parent zone to track key rollovers.
   Consolidated reverse zones (Section 8) replace delegations with CNAME
   and/or DNAME pointers.  This reduces the number of secure delegations
   that must be managed, which should make operations simpler and more
   robust; however it means that reverse DNS resolution depends on
   chains of trust in the forward DNS as well as the reverse DNS.  This
   does not necessarily increase the number of trusted entities in a
   meaningful way, if the consolidated reverse zone is in the same part
   of the namespace as the targets of the PTR records.

11.3.  Reverse DNS UPDATE

   The canonicalization process changes the owner name that will be
   affected by the update.  An active attacker might interfere with the
   canonicalization process and trick the requestor to update a node of
   the attacker's choice if the canonicalization process is not secured
   by using TSIG [RFC2845] or DNSSEC [RFC4033] or other means.

   When using DNSSEC, an implementation might decide to accept
   canonicalized names only on condition that the overall security
   status of the canonicalization process is sufficient according to the

Internet-Draft      Classless reverse DNS delegation       November 2015


   local policy.  Because the chain of redirections might involve
   multiple DNS zones, implementations MUST use the lowest security
   status from all links in the chain of redirections when doing
   security decisions.

Appendix A.  Changes since RFC2317

   o  Use a recommended naming convention in the main example.  Clearly
      describe which alternative conventions are good and bad ideas.

   o  Add a description of /32 delegations.

   o  Add a description of using DNAME for delegations on short
      prefixes.

   o  Emphasize the consolidated reverse DNS convention.

Internet-Draft      Classless reverse DNS delegation       November 2015


   o  Add a description of $GENERATE and use it in the examples.

   o  Specify new requirements on dynamic reverse DNS UPDATE clients.

   o  Better citations for Glen Herrmannsfeldt's original description.


Appendix B.  Questions for reviewers

   Is the $GENERATE section a good idea?  Should it be ditched?  Or
   maybe promoted to its own document?

   RFC 2317 is BCP 20.  Should this document be moved to the standards
   track, since it updates RFC 2136?  Or should the UPDATE amendment be
   a separate document?

   I have generally avoided RFC 2119 keywords in the sections describing
   how to set up classless delegations, since those sections contain
   operational advice rather than implementation requirements.  Other
   opinions welcome.

   Is the indirection problem specific to classless reverse DNS (which
   is the approach I took) or does it apply to the forward DNS as well?
   Suggestions for wording welcome.

   Is the detailed UPDATE behaviour sensible?


Appendix C.  Changelog

   Note to RFC editor:  This section should be removed before
      publication.  The important points should appear in the previous
      section.

   A detailed revision log can be found at
   <https://git.csx.cam.ac.uk/x/ucs/u/fanf2/rfc2317bis.git>.

C.1.  Chnages between -00 and -01

   o  Note troublesome zone file names.

   o  Clarify DNAME-at-apex

   o  Notes on first-last vs first-prefixlen

   o  Compatibility note about $GENERATE

Internet-Draft      Classless reverse DNS delegation       November 2015


   o  Note possible workaround for reverse DNS UPDATE canonicalization
      problem.

   o  Accommodate more than just PTR records in the reverse DNS.

   o  Incorporate some security considerations from
