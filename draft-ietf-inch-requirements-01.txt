     1. Introduction 
      
        Computer security incidents occur across administrative domains often 
        spanning different organizations and national borders. Therefore, the 
        exchange of incident information and statistics among involved 
        parties and the responsible Computer Security Incident Response Teams 
        (CSIRTs) is crucial for both reactionary analysis of current intruder 
        activity and proactive identification of trends that can lead to 
        incident prevention.  
         
        In the following we refer to the information pertaining to an 
        incident as an Incident Report.  
         
        To facilitate the incident related information exchange a common well 
        defined format is needed. 
         
        This document defines the high-level functional requirements of a 
        Format for INcident report Exchange (FINE).  
         
         
     2. Incident Handling Framework 
         
        2.1. Incident Description Terms 
         
        In the following we define the main terms used in this document. 
        There are based on current definitions in related documents [7, 8, 9, 
        10, 11].

     INTERNET DRAFT            FINE Requirements                June, 2003 

         
        2.1.1. Attack 
         
        An assault on system security that derives from an intelligent 
        threat, i.e., an intelligent act that is a deliberate attempt 
        (especially in the sense of a method or technique) to evade security 
        services and violate the security policy of a system. 
         
        An Attack can be active, passive. It may be perpetrated by an 
        insider, an outsider or, via an attack mediator.  
         
        2.1.2. Attacker 
         
        Attacker is individual who attempts one or more attacks. 
         
        For the purpose of FINE, an attacker is described by the 
        computer/network ID, from which the attack was launched. The 
        organisation name and/or physical location of the computer/network 
        are used as additional information. 
         
        2.1.3. CSIRT 
         
        CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team) is a team that 
        coordinates and supports the response to security incidents that 
        involve sites within a defined constituency [7]. The CSIRT generates, 
        processes and maintains incident reports. 
         
        2.1.4. Damage 
         
        The intended or unintended consequence of an attack. Description of 
        damage may include free text description of actual result of attack, 
        and, where possible, structured information about the particular 
        damaged system, subsystem or service. 
         
        2.1.5. Event 
         
        An action directed at a target, which is intended to result in a 
        change of state (status) of the target.  From the point of view of 
        event origination, it can be defined as any observable occurrence in 
        a system or network, which resulted in an alert being generated.  For 
        example, three failed logins in 10 seconds might indicate a brute- 
        force login attack. 
         
        2.1.6. Impact 
         
        Impact describes result of attack expressed in terms of user 
        community, for example the cost in terms of financial or other 
        disruption 
         
        2.1.7. Computer/Network Security Incident 
         
        A Computer/Network Security Incident, referred to as incident in this 
        work, is any adverse event (or group of events) wherein an attempt

     INTERNET DRAFT            FINE Requirements                June, 2003 

        has been made, successfully or otherwise, to compromise some aspect 
        of computer system or network security.  
         
        Typical computer security incidents are: a computer intrusion, a 
        denial-of-service attack, information theft or data manipulation, 
        etc. 
         
        2.1.8. Incident Report 
         
        In this document an Incident Report refers to the information 
        pertaining to an incident. In practice, Incident Report may have 
        internal proprietary format that is adapted to local Incident 
        handling procedure and used Incident Handling System (IHS). 
         
        Definition of the requirements to the format for Incident Report 
        exchange is the subject of this document. 
         
        2.1.9. Target 
         
        The target of an attack. This can be a logical entity( e.g. a user 
        account, a computer process or data, a logical network or 
        internetwork) or a physical entity, e.g. (a computer interface, a  
        router etc.) 
         
        2.1.10. Victim 
         
        The entity which suffered the attack. For the purpose of FINE victim 
        is described by its network ID, organisation and location 
        information. 
         
        2.1.11. Other terms 
         
        Other terms used: alert, activity, IDS, Security Policy, etc., - are 
        defined in related I-Ds, RFCs and standards [2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. 
         
         
        2.2 The Operational Model 
         
        Incident Reports are generated, received and updated. For example, An 
        organization may send an Incident Report to a CSIRT when an attack 
        has been detected. Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) 
        receive Incident Reports from customers, or from other CSIRTs. The 
        CSIRTs maintain these reports. They may process the reports to 
        generate statistics, or investigate the Incident further. As part of 
        the investigation, or as part of the reporting the CSIRT may forward 
        the Incident Report or parts of it to other CSIRTs. The CSIRTs may 
        also receive results of investigation, or additional information 
        related to currently active Incident from other CSIRTs.  
         
        These operations are shown in fig. 1

                     Fig. 1 Operational Model for FINE 
         
         
        From the operational point of view during the life-cycle of an 
        Incident Report the following may apply: 
        + the report itself evolves; 
        + the report is exchanged between CSIRTs and may be 
          investigated/processed by multiple CSIRTs, simultaneously; 
        + the changes in the report may be effected by one or more CSIRTs; 
        + a single CSIRT may not be in a position to vouch for the veracity 
          of all parts of the Incident Report; 
        + the Incident Report may exist in several states:  
          - handling û Incident is being handled 
          - complete/closed - the Incident Report is not being processed and 
          no processing is planned 
          - waiting - the Incident Report is waiting on some event; 
         
        From the content point of view and due to the nature of operations 
        the following should be also considered for defining requirements to 
        FINE: 
        + various parts of an Incident Report will have information of 
          varying degrees of sensitivity and will need to be handled with 
          the  appropriate level of confidentiality.  
        + Incident Report may be multilingual i.e. different parts of the 
          Incident Report may use different languages. It is also possible 
          that multiple versions of parts of the report exist, each version 
          in a different language. The versions may not be consistent.

     INTERNET DRAFT            FINE Requirements                June, 2003 

     3. The Goal  
      
        The purpose of the Format for INcident Report Exchange (FINE) is to 
        facilitate the exchange of incident information and statistics among 
        involved parties and Computer Security Incident Response Teams 
        (CSIRTs) for reactionary analysis of current security incidents and 
        proactive identification of trends that can lead to incident 
        prevention. A common and well-defined format for Incident Reports 
        will help in exchanging, retrieving and archiving Incident related 
        information across organizations, regions and countries. 
         
        The goal of the FINE format is 
        + to make the semantics of the report as clear and unambiguous as 
          possible, intended for use across organizational, regional and 
          national boundaries; 
        + to ensure that the report (or parts of it) has a well defined 
          syntax; 
        + to ensure that the structure of the report allows easy 
          categorization and statistical analysis; 
        + to ensure the verifiability of the integrity of the report, a the 
          authenticity of the report source. 
         
         
     4. General Requirements 
      
        4.1 The definition of the Format for INcident Report Exchange (FINE) 
        shall reference and use previously published RFCs where possible. 
      
     5. Format Requirements 
         
        5.1 FINE shall support full internationalization and localization. 
         
        A significant part of the Incident Report will comprise of human-
        readable text. Since some Incidents need involvement of CSIRTs from 
        different countries and geographic regions, FINE must have provisions 
        so that the Incident Report can be presented in the local language in 
        accordance with local rules and conventions.  
         
        FINE must have provisions to specify the naming rules and conventions 
        that have been applied in the Incident Report.  
         
        In cases where the messages contain text strings and names that need 
        characters other than Latin-1 (or ISO 8859-1), the information should 
        preferably be represented using the ISO/IEC IS 10646-1 character set 
        and encoded using the UTF-8 transformation format, and optionally 
        using local character sets and encodings. 
         
        In case when Incident information/data is received by party that may 
        not correctly display and process other encoding than UTF-8, or 
        information is exchanged between parties that priory known may not 
        process correctly non-native (but other than UTF-8) encoding, the 
        elements that can carry encoding sensitive information should marked 
        with the special attribute and/or necessary transformation should be

     INTERNET DRAFT            FINE Requirements                June, 2003 

        applied. Use of this attribute can be initiated by sending party, or 
        re-sending party that wants to preserve the specific content. 
         
        5.2 FINE must support aggregation and filtering of Incident Report 
        data. 
         
        The format of FINE must be structured with components that have a 
        well-defined syntax and semantics. 
         
        5.3 FINE must provide the possibility for recording the evolution of 
        an Incident Report during its lifetime.  
         
        An Incident Report may evolve with time. As investigation proceeds, 
        it is likely that more information about an incident will be revealed 
        and parts of the earlier information will be modified/deleted.  FINE 
        must support the recording of these changes.  changes with the level 
        of details defined by internal/adopted Incident Handling procedure.  
         
        5.4 FINE must support the application of an access restriction policy 
        to individual components of the Incident Report. 
         
        An Incident Report may contain sensitive information.  It must be 
        possible to specify the degree of confidentiality for the individual 
        components of the Incident Report. Applications can then implement 
        different levels of access restrictions, for the different components 
        of the Incident Report. 
         
        5.5 FINE report must be globally uniquely identifiable.  
         
        It should be possible to refer to an Incident Report unambiguously 
        using the globally unique identifier. It should also be possible to 
        map the origin/creator of an Incident Report from its globally unique 
        identifier. 
         
        5.6. The Format for Incident report Exchange itself must be 
        extensible. The extension will be in terms of addition of components 
        and/or extending the components. 
         
         
     6. Communication Mechanisms Requirements 
         
        6.1 The communication mechanisms must have no bearing on the 
        authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of a FINE formatted 
        Incident Report. Provisions for authenticity, integrity and 
        confidentiality should be made in FINE. 
         
        Incident Report exchange will normally be conducted using standard 
        communication protocols and exchange mechanisms, for example, e-mail, 
        HTTP, FTP, XML Web Services, etc. FINE must not rely on communication 
        mechanisms or specific applications to ensure authenticity, integrity 
        and/or confidentiality of an Incident Report.

     INTERNET DRAFT            FINE Requirements                June, 2003 

     7. Content Requirements  
         
        7.1 FINE must be flexible enough to support various degrees of 
        completeness. At the same time it must clearly state the minimal 
        information without which the information in the Incident Report will 
        be seriously degraded. 
         
        7.2 FINE must contain information about the various entities involved 
        in the incident. An Incident Report will generally refer to one or 
        more entities. The entity may be the attacker, perpetrator, victim, 
        or an observer. 
         
        7.3 FINE should support the description of various aspects/details of 
        the entities involved in the incident. There may be several facets of 
        an entity involved in an Incident Report. The entity may have zero or 
        more network addresses and names as well as zero or more location 
        names, organizational names, person names, machine names etc.. 
         
        7.4 FINE should contain the description of the method how the attack 
        or security event was conducted if it is known. 
         
        Well-known classification/enumeration schemes should be used to 
        describe the type of attack or vulnerabilities and exposures caused 
        particular Incident or security Event.  
         
        7.5 FINE must include the identity of the creator (or current owner) 
        of the Incident Report (CSIRT or other authority).  This may be the 
        sender in an information exchange or the team currently handling the 
        incident. 
         
        7.6 FINE should contain reference to advisories corresponding to the 
        Incident Report, e.g. CERT/CC, CVE, and others. 
         
        7.7 The FINE may contain a description of the Incident or comprising 
        security events in a natural language. 
         
        7.8 FINE should provide the possibility to include or reference 
        additional detailed information/data related to the specific 
        underlying event(s)/activity. 
         
        This information may include IDMEF [5] messages, which have been 
        generated by security devices. 
         
        7.9 FINE should provide the possibility for describing the impact of 
        an incident.  
        There should be guidelines to describe the impact on the target 
        to ensure a uniform interpretation of the description. 
         
        7.10 The Incident Report should describe the actions taken since the 
        occurrence of the incident. 
         
        7.11 Time shall be reported as the local time and time zone offset 
        from UTC.  (Note: See RFC 1902 for guidelines on reporting time.) 
      
     Expires December 2003                                         [Page 8] 
      
     INTERNET DRAFT            FINE Requirements                June, 2003 

         
        Internal Incident Report may contain local presentation of time 
        related information, however FINE must support unambiguous time 
        specification. In case when normalization of the time information is 
        not possible (like in case of referencing additional data about the 
        Incident that cannot be changed, e.g. timestamped log data), the time 
        offset should be mentioned. 
         
        7.12 FINE will not have any specific requirement for granularity of 
        time. 
         
        Different systems will support different time granularities. FINE 
        should be able to support Incident Reports from various systems 
        irrespective of their time granularity. 
         
        7.13 FINE should allow the application of external mechanisms to 
        support authenticity, integrity and non-repudiation checks of 
        Incident Reports. 
         
        7.14 FINE must have a well defined semantics.  
         
         
     8. Security Considerations 
         
        This memo does not describe a protocol by itself. This memo describes 
        the requirements for an Incident Report Exchange Format. The reports 
        themselves are about security incidents. The contents of the Incident 
        Reports will have significant direct and/or indirect impact on the 
        security and privacy of a network and/or individuals. FINE 
        implementers should take care to analyze and implement the 
        requirements stated in 5.5 and 7.12.
