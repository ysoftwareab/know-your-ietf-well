               Ownership and licensing statements in YANG
                        draft-ietf-opsawg-ol-00

Abstract

   This memo provides for an extension to RFC 8520 that allows MUD file
   authors to specify ownership and licensing of MUD files themselves.
   This memo updates RFC 8520.  However, it can also be used for
   purposes outside of MUD, and the grouping is structured as such.

Status of This Memo

   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   Task Force (IETF).  Note that other groups may also distribute

1.  Introduction

   [RFC8520] Manufacturer Usage Descriptions (MUD) can be used to
   describe devices and their requirements to the network
   infrastructure.  The original version of the specification does not
   provide for a means to specify ownership and licensing of the MUD
   file itself.  This can hinder those wishing to use, modify, or adapt
   MUD files for the purpose of offering them, when the manufacturer is
   not involved.

   *  *Issue*: Should this be an owner or an originator?

   To avoid any confusion, we define an extension that allows for
   specifying of owners and licensing terms for MUD files.

   Those generating MUD files SHOULD use this extension, and thus this
   extension updates RFC 8520.

   There are two ways to specify a license: a URL pointing to the
   license itself or an SPDX tag [SPDX].  If an SPDX tag is supplied
   consumers MUST interpret that tag through its meaning as specified by
   [SPDX].

   *  *Issue*: Should we simply say that a URI contains a colon and SPDX
      license identifier doesn't?

   This grouping may be used for other YANG models that reside as static
   objects.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  The owner-license extension and model

   Because the model is primarily motivated by MUD, and based on the way
   that YANG trees are formed, the model appears as an augmentation for
   MUD.

   module: ietf-ol

     augment /mud:mud:
       +--rw ol
          +--rw owners*               string
          +--rw (license-type)?
             +--:(spdx-lt)
             |  +--rw spdx-tag?       string
             +--:(url)
                +--rw license-info?   inet:uri

   *  *Issue*: Should different owners possibly have their own license
      types?  (Logical and, derived works.)

   *  *Issue*: Should a single owner possibly have multiple license
      types?  (Logical or, multi-licensing.)

3.  The YANG schema for ownership and licensing

   The following grouping and augmentation are proposed.

   <CODE BEGINS>
   file "ietf-ol@2021-05-21.yang"
   module ietf-ol {
     yang-version 1.1;
     namespace "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-ol";
     prefix ol;

     import ietf-inet-types {
       prefix inet;
     }

     import ietf-mud {
       prefix mud;
     }

4.  Extension for MUD

   MUD files using this extension MUST include "ol" in the extensions
   array, as specified by [RFC8520].

5.  Example

   In this example, the Frobmaster company is using the 0BSD SPDX tag to
   indicate a relatively open license.  The "ol" extension and container
   are present.  There is a single owner listed.

   *  *Task*: need Makefile for validating this against MUD.  (Probably
      put this into a separate file, too.)

   *  *Issue*: Should we give an example for usage outside yang?

6.  Security Considerations

   No security considerations have been identified.

   *  *Issue*: Should we maybe point out any specific seccons of 8520?

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  MUD Extension

   The IANA is requested to add "ol" to the MUD extensions registry as
   follows:

     Extension Name: ol
     Standard reference: This document

8.  Normative References
