                  Bootstrapping WebSockets with HTTP/3
                  draft-ietf-httpbis-h3-websockets-00

Abstract

   The mechanism for running the WebSocket Protocol over a single stream
   of an HTTP/2 connection is equally applicable to HTTP/3, but needs to
   be separately registered.  This document describes the mechanism for
   HTTP/3.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC8441] defines an extension to HTTP/2 which is also useful in
   HTTP/3.  This extension makes use of an HTTP/2 setting.  Appendix A.3
   of [HTTP3] describes the required updates for HTTP/2 settings to be
   used with HTTP/3.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Websockets Upgrade over HTTP/3

   [RFC8441] defines a mechanism for running the WebSocket Protocol
   [RFC6455] over a single stream of an HTTP/2 connection.  It defines
   an Extended CONNECT method which specifies a new ":protocol" pseudo
   header field and new semantics for the ":path" and ":authority"
   pseudo header fields.  It also defines a new HTTP/2 SETTING sent by a
   server to allow the client to use Extended CONNECT.

   The HTTP/3 stream closure is also analogous to the TCP connection
   closure of [RFC6455].  Orderly TCP-level closures are represented as
   a FIN bit on the stream (Section 4.2 of [HTTP3]).  RST exceptions are
   represented with an stream error (Section 8 of [HTTP3]) of type
   H3_REQUEST_CANCELLED (Section 8.1 of [HTTP3])

   The semantics of the headers and SETTING are identical to those in
   HTTP/2 as defined [RFC8441].  Appendix A.3 of [HTTP3] requires thatt
   HTTP/3 settings be registered separately for HTTP/3.  The
   SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL value is 0x08 (decimal 8), as in
   HTTP/2.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security considerations beyond those
   discussed in [RFC8841].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a new setting in the "HTTP/3 Settings"
   registry ([HTTP3]).

   +==================================+======+===============+=========+
   | Setting Name                     |Value | Specification | Default |
   +==================================+======+===============+=========+
   | SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL | 0x08 | This document | 0       |
   +----------------------------------+------+---------------+---------+
