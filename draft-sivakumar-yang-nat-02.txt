         YANG Data Model for Network Address Translation (NAT)
                      draft-sivakumar-yang-nat-02

Abstract

   For the sake of network automation and the need for programming NAT
   function in particular, a data model for configuring and managing the
   NAT device is essential.  This document defines a YANG data model for
   the NAT function.  Both the NAT44 and NAT64 are covered in this
   document.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a data model for Network Address Translation
   (NAT) using the YANG data modeling language [RFC6020].  Traditional
   NAT is defined in [RFC2663] and Carrier Grade NAT is defined in
   [RFC6888].  This document covers the NAT features in both documents.
   This document also covers the NAT64 as defined in [RFC6146].

   This document assumes [RFC4787][RFC5382][RFC5508] are enabled by
   default.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The usage of the term "NAT device" in this document refer to any
   NAT44 and NAT64 devices.  This document uses the term "Session" as it
   is defined in [RFC2663] and the term BIB as it is defined in
   [RFC6146].

1.2.  Tree Diagrams

   The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is as follows:

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Curly braces "{" and "}" contain names of optional features that
      make the corresponding node conditional.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      (read-write), "ro" state data (read-only).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!" a
      container with presence, and "*" denotes a "list" or "leaf-list".

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

2.  Overview of the NAT YANG Data Model

   The NAT data model is designed to cover both configuration and state
   retrieval, nevertheless this document covers dynamic (implicit)
   mapping while PCP-related functionality to instruct dynamic explicit
   mapping is defined in [I-D.boucadair-pcp-yang].

   In order to cover both NAT64 and NAT44 flavors, the NAT mapping
   structure allows to include an IPv4 or IPv6 address as an internal IP
   address.  Remaining fields are common to both NAT schemes.

   A NAT function can either assign individual port numbers or port
   sets.  Both features are supported in the YANG data model.

   To accommodate deployments where [RFC6302] is not enabled, the NAT
   function can be configured to log the destination port number.

   This data model assumes that pools of IPv4 addresses can be
   provisioned to NAT function.  These pools may be contiguous or non-
   contiguous.

   A NAT device can enabled multiple NAT instances; each responsible to
   service a group of internal hosts.  This document does make any
   assumption how internal hosts are attached to a given NAT instance.

   The data model assumes that each NAT instance can: be enable/
   disabled, be provisioned with a dedicated configuration data, and
   maintain its own mapping table.

   This version of the document does not cover the following
   functionalities:

   o  DSCP-related operations.
   o  Exclude/include ports (e.g.; system port) from the port assignment
      pool.
   o  Deterministic NAT assignment scheme.

                      Example: suppose the 2001:db8:100:100::/56 prefix
                      is assigned to a NAT64 serviced CPE. Suppose also
                      that 2001:db8:100:100::1 is the IPv6 address used
                      by the client that resides in that CPE. When the
                      NAT64 receives a packet from this client,
                      it applies the subscriber-mask (e.g., 56) on
                      the source IPv6 address to compute the associated
                      prefix for this client (2001:db8:100:100::/56).
                      Then, the NAT64 enforces policies based on that
                      prefix (2001:db8:100:100::/56), not on the exact
                      source IPv6 address.";

4.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this memo is designed to be accessed via
   the NETCONF protocol [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the
   secure transport layer and the support of SSH is mandatory to
   implement secure transport [RFC6242].  The NETCONF access control
   model [RFC6536] provides means to restrict access for particular
   NETCONF users to a pre-configured subset of all available NETCONF
   protocol operations and contents.

   All data nodes defined in the YANG module which can be created,
   modified and deleted (i.e., config true, which is the default).
   These data nodes are considered sensitive.  Write operations (e.g.,
   edit-config) applied to these data nodes without proper protection
   can negatively affect network operations.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to register the following URI in the
   "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688]:

            URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-nat
            Registrant Contact: The IESG.
            XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.


   This document requests IANA to register the following YANG module in
   the "YANG Module Names" registry [RFC6020].

            name: ietf-nat
            namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-nat
            prefix: nat
