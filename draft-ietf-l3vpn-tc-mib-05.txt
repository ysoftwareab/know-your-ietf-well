1.  Introduction

    This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
    In particular, it defines Textual Conventions used in VPNs and IETF
    VPN-related MIBs.


1.1 Conventions Used in This Document

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
    this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119
    [RFC2119].


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

    For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
    Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
    RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

    Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
    the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
    accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
    Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
    Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a
    MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in
    STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58,
    RFC 2580 [RFC2580].


3.  VPN-TC-STD-MIB

3.1 Description

    The VPN-TC-STD-MIB defines a Textual Convention for the Global VPN
    Identifier, or VPN-ID, as specified in [RFC2685]. The purpose of a
    VPN-ID is to uniquely identify a VPN. It MUST be 7 octets in length,
    and SHOULD be comprised of a 3 octet Organizationally Unique
    Identifier (OUI) which uniquely identifies the VPN Authority,
    followed by a 4 octet value assigned by the VPN Authority that

    uniquely identifies the VPN within the context of the OUI.

    DESCRIPTION
        "The purpose of a VPN-ID is to uniquely identify a VPN.
         The Global VPN Identifier format is:
         3 octet VPN Authority, Organizationally Unique Identifier
         followed by 4 octet VPN index identifying VPN according 
         to OUI"

VPNIdOrZero ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS            current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This textual convention is an extension of the
         VPNId textual convention which defines non-zero-length
         OCTET STRING to identify a physical entity. This extension
         permits the additional value of a zero-length OCTET STRING.
         The semantics of the value zero-length OCTET STRING are
         object-specific and must therefore be defined
         as part of the description of any object which uses this
         syntax. Examples of the usage of this extension are
         situations where none or all VPN IDs need to be
         referenced."

4.  Security Considerations

    This memo defines textual conventions and object identities
    for use in VPN MIB modules.  Security issues for these MIB
    modules are addressed in the memos defining those modules.
