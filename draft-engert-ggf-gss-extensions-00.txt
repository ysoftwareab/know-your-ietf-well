       GWD-R.P                   GSS-API Extensions             February 2003 
        
             
       Introduction 
           
          RFC 2743 defines the Generic Security Service Application 
          Program Interface (GSS-API) Version 2, Update 1 [3, 4], as an 
          API for portably adding authentication, delegation, and message 
          protection to distributed computing applications. 
           
          In 1997, the Globus Project (www.globus.org) introduced an 
          implementation of GSS-API called the Grid Security 
          Infrastructure (GSI). This implementation uses public key 
          protocols for use in programming Grid applications [2] -- that 
          is, applications that run in dynamic, inter-domain distributed 
          computing environments. Based on this implementation, a great 
          deal of experience has been gained on the use of GSS-API in 
          numerous real applications and middleware toolkits. While this 
          experience has been overwhelmingly positive, it has also led to 
          an understanding of some deficiencies in the existing GSS-API.   
           
          This document defines extensions to the GSS-API to address these 
          deficiencies. These extensions are: 
           
          *  Credential export and import: Processes need to be able, in a 
             controlled and standard fashion, to export credentials to and 
             import credentials from other processes. This includes 
             processes that are not written to the GSS-API. 
              
          *  Delegation at any time: GSS-API only allows for delegation 
             during the initial context establishment, via an argument to 
             gss_init_sec_context. This document extends GSS-API to also 
             allow for delegation at any time after initial context 
             establishment. 
              
          *  Credential extensions handling: When delegating a credential, 
             it is often useful to attach additional data, such as 
             restriction policies, to that delegated credential which 
             restricts its usage. This document defines extensions to the 
             GSS-API to allow such extensions to be specified during 
             delegation and to be extracted from a security context after 
             authentication. However, the approach is neutral to the 
             actual attached data.  
           
          Section 1.1 defines the GSS-API extensions.

       1.1.    Extension Specifications 
           
          The following sections explain needed extensions to the GSS-API 
          as defined in RFC 2743 and give proposed additional functions to 
          be added to the API. 
           
       1.2.    Credential Export and Import 
           
          In order to portably implement a reliable service that can 
          accept delegated credentials from multiple clients, these 
          functions are needed to allow the service to checkpoint and 
          reload the delegated credential to and from permanent storage. 
           
          These functions also provide support for servers that need to 
          pass a credential on to other processes, for example a sshd 
        
       meder@mcs.anl.gov                                                    5 
       GWD-R.P                   GSS-API Extensions             February 2003 
        
          daemon that accepts a delegated credential from a client and 
          then wants to make that credential available to the spawned 
          shell process. 
           
          Previously applications which needed this functionality were 
          forced to use mechanism specific lower level routines, defeating 
          the purpose of a generic interface. 
           
          The gss_export_cred function allows exporting credentials in one 
          of two forms as selected by the option_req parameter.  
           
          When option_req is equal to 0, it exports an opaque buffer 
          suitable for storage in memory or on disk or passing to another 
          process, which can import the buffer with gss_import_cred. This 
          method of invocation will normally be used by applications that 
          want to transfer a credential to another GSS application or save 
          a credential to some storage medium so it can be loaded later 
          (perhaps after a restart). 
           
          With option_req is equal to 1, it exports a buffer filled with 
          mechanism-specific information that the calling application can 
          use to pass the credential to another process that is not 
          written to the GSS-API. This is intended to work with the 
          existing Kerberos and GSI GSS implementations. These 
          implementation normally store credentials by writing the 
          credentials to a file and then storing the path to that file in 
          an environment variable. In the case of these implementations 
          this function stores the credential on disk and returns a buffer 
          containing a string suitable for passing to putenv(3). This 
          method of invocation will normally be used by applications, such 
          as SSHD, which accept a delegated GSS credential and then want 
          to make this credential available to the shell process they 
          spawn. 
           
          Note that in either case, you cannot pass the exported 
          credential to another machine over the network and assume it 
          will work. Passing a credential to another process may also fail 
          if the process does not have the same privileges as the original 
          process. 
           
          A credential can also expire between export and import. In this 
          case the import of the credential may fail, returning an error. 
           
          The gss_import_cred function is the complimentary function to 
          gss_export_cred. When called with the exported buffer and 
          option_req set to the same value used in the gss_export_cred 
        
       meder@mcs.anl.gov                                                    6

          call it will return a credential handle suitable for use with 
          other GSS-API functions. While this function is similar in 
          function to gss_acquire_cred, there is no compatibility between 
          the two (i.e. one cannot take a buffer from gss_export_cred and 
          use gss_acquire_cred to import it). 
           
       gss_export_cred call 
           
          Inputs: 
           
          . option_req INTEGER û 0 = Export simple data good only for 
            reuse with gss_import_cred, 1 = Export mechanism-specific data 
            that can be passed to non-GSS applications (see following 
            function description). 
        
          . cred_handle CREDENTIAL HANDLE û credential to be exported. May 
            be modified but is stable and usable after call. 
        
          . desired_mech OBJECT IDENTIFIER û desired mechanism for 
            exported credential, may be NULL to indicate system default 
        
          . protection_key OPTIONAL OCTET STRING û if specified, a key 
            used to protect (e.g. encrypt) the exported credential. 
        
          Outputs: 
           
          . major_status INTEGER 
           
          . minor_status INTEGER 
        
          . export_buffer OCTET STRING û token to be used in future 
            gss_import_cred call (if option_req == 0) or mechanism 
            specific data (if option_req == 1). To be freed by caller 
            using gss_release_buffer. 
        
          . actual_mech OBJECT_IDENTIFIER û actual mechanism of the 
            exported credential 
        
          Returned major_status codes: 
           
          . GSS_S_COMPLETE indicates that the operation was successfully 
            completed and export_buffer contains the requested data. 
           
          . GSS_S_CREDENTIALS_EXPIRED indicates the credential referred to 
            by cred_handle has expired and cannot be exported. 
        
        
       meder@mcs.anl.gov                                                    7 
       GWD-R.P                   GSS-API Extensions             February 2003 
        
          . GSS_S_UNAVAILABLE indicates that the requested operation is 
            not supported by the underlying mechanism. 
        
          . GSS_S_BAD_MECH indicates that the requested mechanism is 
            unsupported. 
        
          . GSS_S_FAILURE indicates a failure unspecified at the GSS-API 
            level. 
        
          GSS_export_cred is used to export a credential so that it can be 
          passed to another process or reloaded by the same process after 
          its use of a different credential in the interim. 
           
          If the caller passes in a value of 0 for option_req the returned 
          data will be suitable for use in a call to gss_import_cred at a 
          later date or in a different process. Note that the data may 
          contain the actual credential itself or just a pointer to it 
          (e.g. a filename). In any case it should be assumed that the 
          returned buffer contains sensitive information and care should 
          be taken to protect the privacy of its contents. 
           
          If the caller passes in a value of 1 for option_req the return 
          data contains mechanism-specific data that the calling 
          application can use to pass the credential to another process 
          that does not use the GSS-API. The caller is responsible for 
          understanding this data and knowing what to do with it. For 
          example in the case of both Kerberos 5 and GSI the credential 
          will be stored to a file and the returned data will be a string 
          suitable for passing to putenv(3). In this case the caller may 
          need to change the ownership of the credential file. 
           
          In either case the data is returned in export_buffer, which the

          If the protection_key is provided by the caller, the underlying

            credential has expired. 
          . GSS_S_FAILURE indicates an error unspecified at the GSS-API 
            level. 
        
          Gss_import_cred is the complimentary function to gss_export_cred 
          and is intended to be used to allow use of a credential that was 
          passed from another process or read from storage. 
           
          The credential, or the handle to the credential, is read from 
          import_buffer, which is unmodified. A handle to the credential 
          is returned in cred_handle. 
           
          The lifetime_rec result indicates the length of time for which 
          the acquired credential will be valid, as an offset from the 
          present. A mechanism may return a reserved value indicating 
          INDEFINITE if no constraints on credential lifetime are imposed. 
          A caller of gss_import_cred can request a length of time for 
          which acquired the credential is to be valid (using the 
          lifetime_req parameter), beginning at the present, or can 
          request a credential with a default validity interval. Requests 
          for postdated credentials are not supported within the GSS-API. 
          Certain mechanisms and implementations may supply credential 
          validity period specifiers at a point prior to invocation of the 
          gss_import_cred call (e.g., in conjunction with user login 
          procedures). As a result, callers requesting non-default values 
          for lifetime_req must recognize that such requests cannot always 
          be honored and must be prepared to accommodate the return of a 
          credential with a different lifetime as indicated by 
          lifetime_rec. The lifetime_req parameter should be viewed as 
          advisory and no error should be returned if the lifetime request 
          cannot be honored. 
           
          The protection_key parameters should be used to provide a key to 
          the underlying mechanism to be used to access the credentials in 
          the event they are protected. If the credentials are not 
          protected and a key is provided it SHOULD be ignored. If the 
          credentials are protected and no key is provided a GSS_S_NO_CRED 
          error MUST be returned.

       1.3.    Delegation At Any Time 
           
          These functions are designed to allow more flexible protocols to 
          be built on top of the GSS-API. They allow delegation to happen 
          at times other than context initiation, in either direction 
          regardless of the direction of context initiation (i.e. the 
          acceptor in context initiation can be the delegator) and with a 
          credential other than the credential used for context setup. 
           
          These functions also allow the initiator and acceptor to attach 
          extensions, such as restriction polices, to a delegated 
          credential. These extensions are mechanism-specific and 
          completely opaque to the GSS-API. See the following section on 
          Credential Extension Handling for information about accessing 
          the extension data. 
           
          Furthermore, these functions make it possible to delegate 
          credentials associated with mechanisms other than the mechanism 
          used for context establishment. Application may for example wish 
          to delegate a Kerberos credential over a security context 
          established using GSI. 
           
          The two functions for doing delegation are gss_init_delegation 
          and gss_accept_delegation. These functions are used in a similar 
          manner as gss_init_sec_context and gss_accept_sec_context; they 
          should be called in a loop as long as they return 
          GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED and the tokens output by each should be 
          passed into the other. 
           
          Note that mechanisms are not required to support intermingling 
          of calls to other GSS-API functions (e.g. gss_wrap) with the 
          sequence of calls to needed to perform delegation of a 
          credential. This also implies that if an application initiates a 
          second delegation while a previous one has yet to complete the 
          results may be undefined.

          The desired_object parameter should contain an OID that 
          references information the application is interested in. This

          of data per call and call it iteratively if it returns 
          GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED. 
           
       1.5.    Context options 
           
          Currently there is no method for passing flags into the 
          gss_accept_sec_context call. Instead of changing the arguments 
          to this function we propose a method that allows us to set 
          options on a security context and then pass the context into a 
          first call of gss_accept_sec_context or gss_init_sec_context. 
          This provides the means for an application to achieve more fine-
          grained control of the underlying GSS-API mechanism. 
           
          The option being changed may be mechanism specific or one of the 
          generic options defined below. The Global Grid Forum will define 
          OIDs for the options below. 
           
          Generic options: 
           
          GSS_DISALLOW_ENCRYPTION û Setting this option to 1 will cause 
          the underlying GSS library to disallow any encryption of 
          application data. 
           
          GSS_PROTECTION_FAIL_ON_CONTEXT_EXPIRATION û Setting this option 
          to 1 will case the underlying GSS library to fail if any message 
          protection operation is attempted after the security context has 
          expired. It is recommended that the underlying mechanism allow 
          this option to be set to 0 after such an error in returned so 
          that an application can finish an ongoing process before 
        
       meder@mcs.anl.gov                                                   18

          returning an error to the user. For example, an application may 
          wish to complete a file transfer already in progress before 
          refusing to start another transfer. Note that some 
          implementations may not be able to perform message protection 
          after security context expiration. 
        
          GSS_APPLICATION_WILL_CHECK_EXTENSIONS û Setting this option to a 
          list of OIDs (using the SET OF OBJECT IDENTIFIER data type) will 
          inform the underlying GSSAPI library that the application will 
          take responsibility for checking any extensions in the peer 
          credential identified by these OIDs . If the GSS mechanism 
          encounters a extension during context establishment that the 
          application has not declared its responsibility for, then the 
          GSS mechanism may choose to fail the authentication. The reason 
          for this is that without the knowledge that the application is 
          aware of and taking responsibility for handling the extensions 
          the GSSAPI mechanism cannot be assured they will be respected 
          and must take the safe course of failure.

            specifies that a new security context should be created.

          The sec_context parameter should either be an existing security 
          context or NULL, indicating a new security context should be 
          initialized and the specified option set on the new context. 
           
          The option parameter should contain an OID that references the 
          option that the application wishes to set.   
           
          The value parameter should contain the value the option should 
          be set to. The size of the octet string will vary depending on 
          the option being set (analogous to the UNIX setsockopt 
          function).

          Return major_status codes: 
           
          . GSS_S_COMPLETE indicates that the function completed 
            successfully. 
        
          . GSS_S_FAILURE indicates that the requested operation failed 
            for reasons unspecified at the GSS-API level. 
           
       This function adds a buffer to a buffer set. The member_buffer 
       argument may be released after the completion of this call. 
        
       gss_release_buffer_set call 
          Inputs: 
           
          . buffer_set SET OF OCTET STRING 
           
          Outputs: 
           
          . major_status INTEGER 
           
          . minor_status INTEGER 
        
          Return major_status codes: 
           
          . GSS_S_COMPLETE indicates that the function completed 
            successfully and data was returned. 
           
          . GSS_S_FAILURE indicates that the requested operation failed 
            for reasons unspecified at the GSS-API level. 
           
          This function allows callers to release the storage associated 
          with a SET OF OCTET STRING allocated by another GSS-API call. 
          This call's specific behavior depends on the language and 
          programming environment within which a GSS-API implementation 
          operates, and is therefore detailed within applicable bindings 
          specifications; in particular, implementation and invocation of

       Changes to existing functions 
           
          This section contains changes to the behavior of the existing 
          GSSAPI functions. 
           
       1.7.    gss_accept_sec_context 
           
          The gss_accept_sec_context call will now accept a non-NULL 
          security context, as created by the gss_set_sec_context_option 
          call, on initial call. 
           
       1.8.    gss_init_sec_context 
           
          The gss_init_sec_context call will now accept a non-NULL 
          security context, as created by the gss_set_sec_context_option 
          call, on initial call. 
           
       1.9.    gss_getMIC, gss_verifyMIC, gss_wrap, gss_unwrap 
           
          If the GSS_PROTECTION_FAIL_ON_CONTEXT_EXPIRATION option has been 
          set to 1 by the gss_set_sec_context_option call then these 
          functions should fail if the security context being used has 
          expired. 
           
          If the GSS_PROTECTION_FAIL_ON_CONTEXT_EXPIRATION option is set 
          to 0 then functions should continue to function as long as they 
          possibly can regardless of the expiration of security context. 
          Some implementation may not be able to continue functioning 
          after security context expiration. 
           
       Additional Desired Functionality 
           
          The following sections describe shortcomings in the GSSAPI and 
          propose possible schemes for modifying the API to address these 
          but do not lay out a specific proposal for change. It is the 
          authorsÆ intention to propose a scheme at a later date. 
           
       1.10.   Token Framing 
           
          One major shortcoming in the GSS-API specification is that it 
          does not prescribe or recommend a standard mechanism independent 
          way of framing tokens generated by GSS-API functions.  
          We feel that the absence of a framing mechanism negates the 
          utility of the mech_type and similar parameters, since 
          demultiplexing tokens based on mechanism without said framing 
          becomes nearly impossible.  
        
       meder@mcs.anl.gov                                                   23 
       GWD-R.P                   GSS-API Extensions             February 2003 
        
           
          We realize that almost all mechanisms used to implement the GSS-
          API provide their own framing mechanism and may not want to add 
          additional framing since this may hinder interoperability with 
          non-GSS-API using applications. Thus any proposed framing should 
          not be mandatory. 
           
          It is our opinion that any proposed framing mechanism should at 
          the bare minimum allow for the following: 
            1. A mechanism for determining the length of the token 
            2. A way of determining the mechanism that produced the token 
            3. A mechanism for identifying the token type, where token 
               type indicates the origin (e.g. context establishment, 
               application data à) of the token 
           
          Finally, it may be argued that framing could and should be done 
          at the application level, but even in this case a recommendation 
          would give the benefit of greater interoperability between 
          mechanisms which implement framing at the GSSAPI level.  
           
       1.11.   Different levels of verbosity with gss_display_status 
           
          It is desirable to have different levels of error message 
          verbosity at different times. When returning an error message to 
          a user, simplicity is often the best course. Users tend to want 
          a simple description of the error and maybe a little guidance on 
          how to fix the problem. Long error messages tend to scare them 
          away. 
           
          On the other hand, if a developer or other user seriously 
          interested in debugging is reading the error message, the more 
          information the better. 
           
          The gss_display_status call currently offers no way to select 
          different levels of verbosity in the messages it returns. Some 
          possible ways of implementing this are: 
           
            . Add a way of passing in a flag to the gss_display_call 
               perhaps by defining more values for status type. 
                
            . Defining a predefined string at the beginning of all 
               strings returned by gss_display_status to indicate the 
               verbosity level of the string. This has the advantage that 
               the server can send these strings over the network to a 
               client that can decide the level of verbosity without

       Security Considerations 
           
       1.12.   Credential export and import 
           
          Since exported credential buffers may contain sensitive 
          information (e.g. the credential itself) care must be taken to 
          maintain the privacy of this information. Precautions should 
          include: 
           
          . Storing the exported credential only in files with carefully 
            controlled access polices 
          . Not sending the exported credential over the network in the 
            clear (unencrypted) 
          . Being careful which processes are given access to the 
            credential 
        
       1.13.   Delegation at any time and restricted delegation handling 
           
          Applications delegating credentials need to be sure that they 
          are delegating credentials only to other processes and systems 
          that can be trusted. Since credentials are often stored on disk, 
          compromises of systems can lead to stolen credentials from 
          trusted processes. 
           
          The use of restrictive policies is encouraged for this reason as 
          it can greatly limit the use of any stolen credential.

            3. Added lifetime_req parameter to gss_accept_delegation 
            4. Changed formatting to comply with GGF standard 
            5. Added actual_mech parameter to gss_export_cred and 
               gss_import_cred 
            6. Updated C bindings 
            Changes between version 0.4 and 0.5: 
           
            1. Renamed delegation restrictions to more generic delegation 
               extensions. 
            2. Added gss_create_empty_buffer_set() and 
               gss_add_buffer_set_member() 
            3. Added gss_inquire_cred_by_oid() 
        
            Changes between version 0.3 and 0.4: 
             
            1. Added time_req argument to gss_init_delegation(). 
            2. NULL credential to gss_init_delegation() means to use the 
               default credential. 
            3. Oids and buffers in calls to init_delegation and 
               accept_delegation are now sequences and not sets. 
            4. Added text to 2.2 stating essentially that only one 
               delegation is allowed to be in progress at a given time. 
            5. Revised text in 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 to attempt to clarify 
               restriction oids specify policy languages in restriction 
               buffers. 
            6. Added text to 2.3 about generic oids for retrieving 
               information from the credential and in particular an oid 
               for policies inserted by gss_init_delegation(). 
            7. Added lifetime_rec output to gss_accept_delegation(). 
            8. Added lifetime_req and lifetime_rec parameters to 
               gss_import_context(). 
            9. Added section 2.4: gss_set_sec_context_option(). Deleted 
               section in section 3 that talked about wanting to do this. 
            10.       Added new section 3 disussing changes to existing 
               functions with renumbering elsewhere in the document. 
            11.       Added section 2.5, Housekeeping functions, with 
               subsection 2.5.1 describing the gss_release_buffer_set 
               call.

            12.       Message protection behavior on context expiration 
               is now defined by sections 2.4 and 3.3. 
            13.       Added section 4.2 on the need for verbosity levels 
               in gss_display_status. 
            14.       In Section 5.1 now use credential singular 
               consistently 
            15.       In 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 renamed restrictions_oid to 
               restrictions_oid and restrictions_buffers to 
               restriction_buffers. Also indicated these may be 
               GSS_C_NO_OID_SET and GSS_C_NO_BUFFER_SET respectively. 
            16.       2.2.1 input_token: GSS_C_NO_BUFFER instead of NULL 
            17.       2.2.1 and 2.2.2 output_token: May be empty instead 
               of NULL
