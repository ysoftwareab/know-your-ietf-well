                      Abstract 
                          
                         This  document  defines  a  set  of  IP  Traffic  Engineering  Policy 
                         Provisioning Classes (PRCs) for accounting usage within the context 
                         of a COPS-based policy enforcement scheme. The purpose of those PRCs 
                         is to provide information exploitable by the IP Traffic Engineering 
                         decision-making process. Those PRCs are intended for use by the 
                         reporting process of the IP TE Client-Type [2].

                      1. Introduction 
                          
                         Traffic  engineering  is  one  of  the  possible  means  for  solving 
                         congestion problems and permitting efficient use of the network 
                         resources. Indeed, several tools have been proposed to achieve this 
                         goal. Nevertheless, only few solutions introduce a high level of 
                         automation for the allocation of resources and the configuration 
                         operations. 
                          
                         The design of an IP Traffic Engineering (IP TE) policy implies the 
                         manipulation of a large amount of configuration information that 
                         includes  routing  considerations,  traffic  forecast,  available 
                         resources, etc. These parameters are provisioned as configuration 
                         information  to  the  network  devices  by  means  of  a  COPS-based 
                         communication scheme, thanks to the use of a specific client-type 
                         [2]. But remains the choice of the appropriate parameters to meet 
                         network constraints as well as Quality Of Service (QOS) requirements, 
                         and also to observe the impact of such choice on the stability of the 
                         network. 
                          
                         From this standpoint, several methods can be adopted: either use 
                         statistical data based on mathematical models, or data resulting of 
                         measurements. The advantage of the second method is that it allows 
                         for real time statistics. 
                           
                         Therefore, the actual enforcement of a traffic engineering policy 
                         requires a feedback mechanism not only to qualify how efficient such 
                         enforcement is, but also the impact the future decisions made by the 
                         Policy Decision Point (PDP) and installed by the PDP at the Policy 
                         Enforcement Point (PEP)-embedded devices. 
                          
                         Within the context of this document, the data recorded, monitored 
                         and/or reported by the PEP are the results of the activation of 
                         dynamic routing processes (e.g. Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and 
                         Border Gateway Protocol version 4 (BGP)).  
                          
                         We propose in this document to define a set of IP TE accounting usage 
                         Policy Rule Classes (PRC) that will be monitored, recorded and/or 
                         reported by the PEP. Those PRCs complement the PRC classes that have 
                         been defined in the Framework of COPS-PR PIB for Policy Usage [3]. 
                          
                         This document is organised as follows:

                      4.1. Introduction 
                          
                         The actual enforcement of an IP TE policy is conditioned by the 
                         manipulation of information such as traffic forecast (according to 
                         customers' requests, for example [5]), and traffic load calculation 
                         (see  fig.1).  Within  the  context  of  a  COPS  architecture,  the 
                         qualification of a policy's efficiency could be based upon the 
                         accounting mode.  
                          
                         [6] defines the capability to report information to the PDP. Several 
                         types of reports are defined: success, failure and accounting. A 
                         framework of the use of the accounting mode is introduced in [3].

                         According to Fig.1, the report sent by the IP TE client type is 
                         received by the PDP.  
                          
                         The IP TE report classes are instantiated as multiple Provisioning 
                         Instance  (PRI)  instances,  each  of  which  being  identified  by 
                         PRovisioning  Instance  iDentifier  (PRID).  These  classes  contain 
                         attributes  that  actually  describe  the  accounting  IP  TE-related 
                         information collected in the network.

                         Information Base (IP TE PIB). The IP TE PIB could be organized into 
                         the following provisioning classes:  
                           
                         1. The Forwarding classes: the information contained in these classes 
                            is meant to provide a detailed description of the traffic-
                            engineered routes. Only one table is defined: the IP TE Route 
                            table, which describes the information related to TE routes that 
                            have been installed by the routers in their FIBs.  
                          
                         2. The Metrics classes: the information stored in the tables included 
                            in this class is meant to provide the description of the metric 
                            values that will be taken into account by intra- and inter-domain 
                            routing  protocols  for  the  computation  and  the  selection  of 
                            traffic-engineered routes.  
                          
                         3. The Statistics classes: the information contained in these classes 
                            is meant to provide statistics on the enforcement of the TE 
                            policies. 
                          
                         These tables are used as selection tables. 
                          
                      4.3. The IP TE Accounting Usage Tables 
                          
                         Within the context of [10], three policies are defined: 
                         - The selection criteria policy: defines the conditions used by PEP 
                           to monitor and record a usage policy. 
                         - The usage policy: defines what attributes are monitored and/or 
                           recorded by the PEP. 
                         - The linkage policy: provides a linkage for the selection and usage 
                           policies.

                         As mentioned above, the tables defined in the IP TE PIB are used as 
                         the Selection policies and we introduced in the following Section 4 
                         the Usage classes. 
                          
                         In addition, the IP TE Selection Usage Combination Capability Table 
                         contains objects pointing to the IP TE Usage tables, IP TE Selection 
                         tables and Threshold tables.

                                        trigger a report in the next reporting interval, when 
                                        exceeded."   
                                          
                                    ::= { bgpTeThresholdEntry 6 } 
                       
                         END 
                          
                          
                      6. Security Considerations 
                          
                         Data manipulated within the context of IP TE accounting could be used 
                         by the IP TE decision-making processes, but only authorized COPS-PR 
                         communications can take place. Therefore, this draft does not 
                         introduce any additional security issues other than those that have 
                         been identified in the COPS-PR specification [12]. 
                          
                         Nevertheless, the activation of an integrity mechanism is recommended 
                         for external systems making use of the TE accounting data.
