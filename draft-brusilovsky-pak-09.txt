Abstract

   This document proposes to add mutual authentication, based on
   human-memorizable password, to the basic unauthenticated Diffie-Hellman
   key exchange. The proposed algorithm is called Password-authenticated
   Key exchange (PAK). PAK allows two parties to authenticate themselves
   while performing the Diffie-Hellman exchange.

   The protocol is secure against all passive and active attacks.
   In particular, it does not allow either type of attackers to obtain any
   information that would enable an off-line dictionary attack on the
   password. PAK provides Forward Secrecy.

1.  Introduction


    PAK has the following advantages:

    -  It provides a secure authenticated key exchange protocol.
    -  It is secure against offline dictionary attacks when passwords are used.
    -  It ensures Forward Secrecy.
    -  It is proved to be as secure as the Diffie-Hellman solution.

    The PAK protocol [BMP00], [MP05], [X.1035] has been proven to be as secure
    as the Diffie-Hellman [RFC2631], [DH76] in the random oracle model [BR93]. That is,
    PAK retains its security when used with low-entropy passwords. Therefore,
    it can be seamlessly integrated into existing applications, requiring
    secure authentication based on such low-entropy shared secrets.

         of b modulo p
      3) a^b means a^b (mod p).

3.  Password Authenticated Key exchange

    Diffie-Hellman key agreement requires that both the sender and
    recipient of a message create their own secret random numbers and
    exchange the exponentiation of their respective numbers.

    PAK has two parties, Alice (A) and Bob (B), sharing a secret password PW. The
    global Diffie-Hellman publicly-known constants, a prime p and a generator 
    g, are carefully selected so that:

    Brusilovsky                                                       [Page 2]

    Internet Draft           draft-brusilovsky-pak-09.txt         January 2009


    1.  A safe prime p is large enough to make the computation of discrete
        logarithms infeasible and

    2.  Powers of g modulo p cover the entire range of p-1 integers from 1 to
        p-1. (References demonstrate working example of selections).

      Initially, Alice (A) selects a secret random exponent Ra and computes g^Ra;
      Bob (B) selects a secret random exponent Rb and computes g^Rb.
      For efficiency purposes, short exponents could be used for Ra and Rb
      provided they have a certain minimum size.  Then:

      - A --> B: [A, X = H1(A|B|PW)*(g^Ra)] (That X <> 0 must be verified at 
                 the time of password selection);

            Bob
              receives Q (presumably Q = X), verifies that Q <> 0 (if Q = 0,
              Bob aborts the procedure); 
              divides Q by H1(A|B|PW) to get Xab, the recovered value of g^Ra;


      - B --> A:  Y = H2(A|B|PW)*(g^Rb)
                  S1 = H3(A|B|PW|Xab|g^Rb|(Xab)^Rb)


            Alice
              verifies that Y <> 0;
              divides Y by H2(A|B|PW) to get Yba, the recovered value of g^Rb and
              computes S1' = H3(A|B|PW|g^Ra|Yba|(Yba)^Ra);  
              authenticates Bob by checking whether S1' equals the received S1;
              if authenticated, then sets key K = H5(A|B|PW|g^Ra|Yba|(Yba)^Ra)





      Brusilovsky                                                       [Page 3]



      Internet Draft           draft-brusilovsky-pak-09.txt         January 2009



      - A --> B:  S2 = H4(A|B|PW|g^Ra|Yba|(Yba)^Ra)


            Bob
              Computes S2' = H4(A|B|PW|Xab|g^Rb|(Xab)^Rb) and
              authenticates Alice by checking whether S2' equals the received S2;
              if authenticated then sets K = H5(A|B|PW|Xab|g^Rb|(Xab)^Rb)

    If any of the above verifications fails, the protocol halts; otherwise,
    both parties have authenticated each other and established the key.


4.  Selection of parameters

    This section provides guidance on selection of the PAK parameters. First, it
    addresses general considerations, then it reports on specific implementations.

4.1 General considerations

    In general implementations, the parameters must be selected to meet algorithm
    requirements of [BMP00].

4.2 OTASP and WLAN Diffie-Hellman parameters and key expansion functions

    [OTASP], [TIA 683], and [WLAN] pre-set public parameters p and g to their "published"
    values. This is necessary to protect against an attacker sending bogus p
    and g values tricking the legitimate user to engage in improper
    Diffie-Hellman exponentiation and leaking some information about the
    password.


    According to [OTASP], [TIA 683], and [WLAN], g shall be set to 00001101, and p to the 
    following 1024-bit prime number (Most-significant-bit first):

    0xFFFFFFFF     0xFFFFFFFF      0xC90FDAA2      0x2168C234      0xC4C6628B
    0x80DC1CD1     0x29024E08      0x8A67CC74      0x020BBEA6      0x3B139B22
    0x514A0879     0x8E3404DD      0xEF9519B3      0xCD3A431B      0x302B0A6D
    0xF25F1437     0x4FE1356D      0x6D51C245      0xE485B576      0x625E7EC6
    0xF44C42E9     0xA637ED6B      0x0BFF5CB6      0xF406B7ED      0xEE386BFB
    0x5A899FA5     0xAE9F2411      0x7C4B1FE6      0x49286651      0xECE65381
    0xFFFFFFFF     0xFFFFFFFF


    In addition, if short exponents [MP05] are used for Diffie-Hellman
    parameters Ra and Rb, then they should have a minimum size of 384 bits. The independent 
    random functions H1 and H2 should each output 1152 bits assuming prime p is 1024 bits 
    long and session keys K are 128 bits long. H3, H4, and H5 each output 128 bits.
    More information on instantiating random functions using hash functions
    can be found in [BR93]. We use the FIPS 180 SHA-1 hashing function below
    to instantiate the random function as done in [WLAN], however, SHA-256 
    can also be used:


    H1(z): SHA-1(1|1|z) mod 2^128 | SHA-1(1|2|z) mod 2^128 |. . .| SHA-1(1|9|z)
    mod 2^128

    H2(z): SHA-1(2|1|z) mod 2^128 | SHA-1(2|2|z) mod 2^128 |. . .| SHA-1(2|9|z)
    mod 2^128


Brusilovsky                                                       [Page 4]



Internet Draft           draft-brusilovsky-pak-09.txt         January 2009


    H3(z): SHA-1(3|len(z)|z|z) mod 2^128
    H4(z): SHA-1(4|len(z)|z|z) mod 2^128
    H5(z): SHA-1(5|len(z)|z|z) mod 2^128


    In order to create 1152 output bits for H1 and H2, nine calls to SHA-1
    are made and 128 least-significant bits of each output are used. The input 
    payload of each call to SHA-1 consists of:

    a) 32 bits of function type which for H1 is set to 1 and for H2 is set to 2;
    b) a 32 bit counter value, which is incremented from 1 to 9 for each call to 
       SHA-1;
    c) the argument z [for (A|B|PW)].

    The functions H3, H4, and H5 require only one call to the SHA-1 hashing
    function and their respective payloads consist of:

    a) 32 bits of function type (e.g. 3 for H3);
    b) a 32 bit value for the length of the argument z;
    c) the actual argument repeated twice.

    Finally, the 128 least-significant bits of the output are used.


5.  IANA considerations

    No IANA considerations at this time

6.  Security considerations

    Those are as follows:

    - Identifiers
    Any protocol that uses PAK must specify a method for producing a single 
    representation of identity strings.
	
    - Shared secret 
    PAK involves the use of a shared secret. Protection of the shared
    values and managing (limiting) their exposure over time is essential, and
    it can be achieved using well-known security policies and measures. 
    If a single secret is shared among more than two entities (e.g., Alice, Bob, and
    Mallory), then Mallory can represent himself as Alice to Bob without Bob being 
    any the wiser.
    
    - Selection of Diffie-Hellman parameters
    The parameters, p and g, must be carefully selected in order not to 
    compromise the shared secret. Only previously agreed upon values for 
    parameters p and g should be used in the PAK protocol. This is necessary to 
    protect against an attacker sending bogus p and g values and thus tricking 
    the other communicating party in an improper Diffie-Hellman exponentiation.
    Both parties also need to randomly select a new exponent each time the key 
    agreement protocol is executed. If both parties re-use the same values, 
    then Forward Secrecy property is lost.
    In addition, if short exponents Ra and Rb are used then they should have a 
    minimum size of 384 bits (assuming that 128-bit session keys are used).    
    Historically, the developers, who strived for 128-bit security (and thus 
    selected 256-bit exponents)  added 128 bits to the exponents to ensure the 
    security reductions proofs. This should explain how an "odd" length of 384 has 
    been arrived at.

    - Protection against attacks
    a) There is a potential attack, the so-called discrete logarithm attack on the
    multiplicative group of congruencies modulo p, in which an adversary can
    construct a table of discrete logarithms to be used as a "dictionary". A
    sufficiently large prime, p, must be selected to protect against such an
    attack. A proper 1024-bit value for p and an appropriate value for g are
    published in [WLAN] and [TIA 683]. For the moment, this is what has been
    implemented; however, a larger prime (i.e., one that is 2048-bit long
    or even larger) will definitely provide better  protection. It is important
    to note that once this is done, the generator must be changed, too, so this
    task must be approached with extreme care.
    b) An on-line password attack can be launched by an attacker by repeatedly
    guessing the password and  attempting to authenticate. The implementers of
    PAK should consider employing mechanisms (such as lockouts) for preventing
    such attacks.
 
    - Recommendations on H() functions 
    The independent random functions H1 and H2 should have output 1152 bits each,
    assuming prime p is 1024 bits long and session keys K are 128 bits long. The
    random functions H3, H4, and H5 should output 128 bits.
    

An example of secure implementation of PAK is provided in [Plan 9].
