Internet-Draft     Mobile Node Group Identifier Option        March 2009


Abstract

   This document specifies a new mobility option for use in Proxy
   Binding Update and Proxy Binding Acknowledgement messages.  This
   option can be used by the mobility entities in a Proxy Mobile IPv6
   domain for carrying the group affiliation of a mobile node in any of
   the mobility signaling messages.

Internet-Draft     Mobile Node Group Identifier Option        March 2009


1.  Introduction

   The Proxy Mobile IPv6 base specification [RFC-5213] uses the mobile
   node identifier in the mobility signaling messages for identifying
   the mobile node.  However, the signaling messages lack the capability
   to identify a set of mobile nodes which have a common characteristic.
   A group identifier associated with a mobile node enables the ability
   to perform protocol operation on a set of mobile nodes via a single
   transaction.  The group identifier provides a more optimal mechanism
   for protocol operation which would otherwise require multiple atomic
   transactions on a per mobile node basis.  Following are some of the
   use-cases where such identifier can be used.

   o  In a blade architecture system running the local mobility anchor
      service, all the mobile node sessions anchored on a given card can
      be part of one single group.  When there is a failure on a
      specific card, the local mobility anchor can initiate the
      revocation signaling to the mobile access gateway by sending a
      sending a single revocation request carrying the group identifier.

   o  For periodic re-registrations
      [draft-premec-netlmm-bulk-re-registration], the mobile access
      gateway may send a single re-registration message for each of the
      mobile node's groups and perform re-registrations for all the
      mobile node's that are part of that group.

   o  The mobile access gateway or the local mobility anchor in a proxy
      mobile IPv6 domain may choose to revoke the registration of mobile
      node associated with a specific realm.  In such cases the mobile
      access gateway or the local mobility anchor can perform the
      binding revocation signaling using the group ID associated with a
      specific set of mobile nodes.

   This document defines a new mobility option, Mobile Node Group
   Identifier option, that can be used by a local mobility anchor and a
   mobile access gateway for exchanging the mobile node's group
   identifier.


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC-2119].

Internet-Draft     Mobile Node Group Identifier Option        March 2009


3.  Signaling and other Considerations


   The Mobile Node's Group Identifier option reflects the group
   affiliation that is local to the local mobility anchor or mobile
   access gateway, as determined by those respective entities.

   The conceptual Binding Update List entry data structure maintained by
   the mobile access gateway, described in Section 6.1 of [RFC-5213],
   MUST be extended to store the mobile node's group identifier.

   The Mobile Node Group Identifier option MAY be used in the Proxy
   Binding Update message sent by the mobile access gateway to the local
   mobility anchor.  When this option is included, the identifier value
   in the option MUST be set to the mobile node's group identifier,
   local to the mobile access gateway

   The conceptual Binding Cache entry data structure maintained by the
   local mobility anchor, described in Section 5.1 of [RFC-5213], MUST
   be extended to store the mobile node's group identifier.

   The Mobile Node Group Identifier option MAY be used in the Proxy
   Binding Acknowledgement message sent by the local mobility anchor to
   the mobile access gateway.  When this option is included, the
   identifier value in the option MUST be set to the mobile node's group
   identifier, local to the local mobility anchor.


4.  Mobile Node Group Identifier Option

   A new option, Mobile Node Group Identifier option is defined for
   using it in Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding Acknowledgement
   messages exchanged between a local mobility anchor and mobile access
   gateway.  This option is used for carrying the mobile node's group
   identifier.

   The alignment requirement for this option is 4n.

      Length

          8-bit unsigned integer indicating the length in octets of
          the option, excluding the type and length fields.  The value
          for this field MUST be set to 6.

      Reserved

          This field is unused for now.  The value MUST be initialized
          to 0 by the sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

      Mobile Node Group Identifier

          A 32-bit field  containing the mobile node's group identifier.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines a new Mobility Header option, the Mobile
   Node Group Identifier option.  This option is described in Section 4.
   The Type value for this option needs to be assigned from the same
   numbering space as allocated for the other mobility options, as
   defined in [RFC-3775].


6.  Security Considerations

   The mobile node's identifier is always present in the Proxy Mobile
   IPv6 signaling messages and additionally carrying the group identity
   of the mobile node introduces similar vulnerabilities.  Specifically,
   it exposes the group affiliation of the user and may result in
   compromising the privacy of the user or the location information.

Internet-Draft     Mobile Node Group Identifier Option        March 2009


   The Mobile Node Group Identifier option defined in this specification
   is for use in Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding Acknowledgement
   messages.  This option is carried like any other mobility header
   option as specified in [RFC-3775] and does not require any special
   security considerations.

   Hence, this specification does not add any new vulnerability to the
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol.
