1.  Introduction

   The OpenPGP format [RFC4880] supports multiple hash algorithms.  This
   document provides the necessary information to use the Secure Hash
   Algorithm-3 (SHA-3) hash algorithm with the OpenPGP format.

   National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) selected
   [Keccak] as the SHA-3 algorithm [SHA-3] for its elegant design, its
   efficiency on various computing devices, high performance in hardware
   implementations, and different internal structure that may provide
   better defense against attacks on its predecessors from the SHA-1 and
   SHA-2 family.

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Overview of the hash algorithm use in OpenPGP

   Hash algorithm is used in [RFC4880] with digital signatures, with
   modification detection code, and to calculate key fingerprints.  Only
   digital signatures allow algorithm agility and are most vulnerable to
   various attacks on hash functions.  The focus of this document is on
   the use of SHA-3 hash with OpenPGP digital signatures.

   The use of hash algorithm with digital signatures in OpenPGP falls
   into two categories.  The first one is the digital signatures over
   messages, and another one is the certifications of the key material.
   The latter area includes self-signatures, which convey key preference
   information, among other tasks.  The rest of key certifications are

   third party key signatures.  These categories will be considered
   separately in more details in Section 6 for the impact on
   interoperability.

4.  Supported SHA-3 algorithms

   SHA-3 specification [SHA-3] defines a single cryptographic hash
   function that is parameterized to produce hash output of certain
   sizes.  This document refers to these instantiations of the same hash
   algorithm as SHA-3 hash algorithms and treats them as different hash
   algorithms with unique IDs

   The SHA-3 algorithms SHA3-256, SHA3-384, and SHA3-512, which have the
   output size of 256, 384, and 512 bits respectively, MAY be used as a
   hash algorithm with digital signatures.

   The input size to the hash algorithm in OpenPGP MUST be a multiple of
   8 bits, in other words, the input is always represented as a sequence
   of 8-bit octets.  In more details, [SHA-3] provides domain separation
   for different instantiations of [Keccak] by prefixing a message-to-
   be-hashed M with two bits 01.  M is what gets hashed with other hash
   algorithms, such as SHA2-256, and MUST be a multiple of 8 bits.  The
   hashing of 01 bits can be integrated into the finalization stage of a
   SHA-3 implementation.  [SHA3IUF] may be useful in verifying the
   correctness of the SHA-3 implementation.

   An application MAY generate signatures with SHA3-256, SHA3-384, and
   SHA3-512 hash algorithms.  An application MUST implement signature
   verification for 3 SHA-3 algorithms if it implements at least one of
   the SHA-3 algorithms.  The all-or-nothing requirement should be
   feasible for the vast majority of implementations because it is
   relatively easy to implement all SHA-3 algorithms with a single
   unified implementation, such that the only variable that
   distinguishes these algorithms is an integer representing the hash
   output size (the capacity of the Keccak).  In particular, there are
   no special tables or magic constants that are specific to the hash
   output size of the SHA-3 algorithms.

   Applications MAY use any digital signature algorithm described in
   [RFC4880] and Elliptic Curve DSA algorithm described in [RFC6637]
   with SHA-3.

5.  Use with RSA digital signatures

   Section 5.2.2 of [RFC4880] describes the Version 3 Signature Packet
   Format.  One of allowed public key algorithms in that section is the
   RSA digital signature algorithm.  RSA signatures use the PKCS#1
   encoding to format (cryptographically "pad") the output of the hash
   algorithm.  The padding includes the DER-encoded prefix that is fixed
   for the given hash algorithm.  While this prefix is a DER encoding of
   an ASN.1 Object Identifier (OID), the length of the hash output, and
   the supporting fields, it's possible to define the prefix as a fixed
   sequence of octets.  These prefixes are defined below.

   Algorithm     ASN.1 OID
   ------------- -------------------------------------------------------
   SHA3-256      2.16.840.1.101.3.4.2.8
   SHA3-384      2.16.840.1.101.3.4.2.9
   SHA3-512      2.16.840.1.101.3.4.2.10

                              SHA-3 hash OIDs

   The full DER-encoded hash prefixes are provided bellow.

   Algorithm     Full DER prefix
   ------------- -------------------------------------------------------
   SHA3-256      30,31,30,0d, 06,09,60,86, 48,01,65,03, 04,02,08,05,
                 00,04,20 [32-byte hash]
   SHA3-384      30,41,30,0d, 06,09,60,86, 48,01,65,03, 04,02,09,05,
                 00,04,30 [48-byte hash]
   SHA3-512      30,51,30,0d, 06,09,60,86, 48,01,65,03, 04,02,0a,05,
                 00,04,40 [64-byte hash]

6.  Interoperability concerns arising from an introduction of a new hash
    algorithm

   The use of a new hash algorithm in a public key certifications,
   especially in self-signatures, can make the key unusable in the large
   extent of the OpenPGP ecosystem.  The impact of the use of the new
   hash algorithm in a digital signature over a message is limited to
   users who will be verifying this message.

   Implementation MUST include SHA-3 algorithms in the Hash Algorithm
   Preferences of the keys it generates when it updates the algorithm
   preferences.  This preference is described in the Section 13.3.2 of
   [RFC4880].

   In cases when the message is both encrypted and signed, the
   application knows the keys of the entities who will be performing
   signature verification.  The application SHOULD rely on Hash
   Algorithm Preferences of the recipients' public keys to learn about
   SHA-3 support.

   Addition of the SHA-3 support will benefit from planning ahead.

   The digital signature validation is dependent on wide support of the
   selected hash algorithm by deployed OpenPGP implementations that will
   be verifying the digital signature.  In general, there is no method
   in OpenPGP by which a party that issues a digital signature can be
   certain about the support of a hash algorithm by other
   implementations.

   The safest method to mitigate these challenges is a phased deployment
   of the new hash algorithm support in the application, as follows:

   o  Implement the hash algorithm, test it thoroughly.

   o  Enable its use with the digital signature algorithms and test
      signature generation and verification, ideally, with multiple
      implementations.  Then disable the signature generation in the
      production code (i.e. leave the "read support" only).

   o  Wait sufficiently long for the deployment of the applications that
      can verify digital signatures with the new hash algorithm.

   o  Enable the generation of signatures with the new hash algorithm,
      starting from the signatures over messages, later extending it to
      certifications.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document asks to allocate the consecutive hash algorithm IDs
   from the Hash Algorithm ID range, defined in the Section 9.4 of
   [RFC4880].

   The starting ID is not important, but the properties that the IDs are
   sequential and in the given order are expected to simplify
   implementation.

8.  Security Considerations

   SHA-3 hash algorithms have different internal structure, informally
   called "wide pipe" or "sponge" design, that may offer higher security
   in the future over the strength of its SHA-2 predecessors with
   identical output size, especially with digital signature
   applications.

   Table 2 from [SP800-57] SHOULD be used to determine the corresponding
   strength of the public key algorithm for the given hash algorithm.
   For example, the SHA-3 256 has equivalent security strength to the
   NIST curve P-256 [RFC6637].  Refer to Table 4 in section A.1 [SHA-3]
   for security strength of the SHA-3 algorithms.
