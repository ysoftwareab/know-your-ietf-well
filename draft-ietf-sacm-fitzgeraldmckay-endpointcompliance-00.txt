1.  Introduction

   This document proposes leveraging the Network Enterprise Assessment
   (NEA) architecture [RFC5209], work from the Trusted Computing Group's
   (TCG) Trusted Network Connect (TNC) Work Group, and the ISO Software
   Identification (SWID) Tag Standard [ISO.19770-2] as a starting place
   for building an endpoint compliance solution.

   The SACM Information Model [I-D.ietf-sacm-information-model] defines
   an internal collector to gather posture attributes from an endpoint.
   These posture attributes must be communicated to a server that can
   store the attributes in a data repository.  This repository of
   endpoint identities and attributes is where work can take place to
   validate the attributes.

   The NEA architecture was originally designed for access control use
   cases.  Using the TLS-based Posture Transport Protocol (PT-TLS)
   [RFC6876], the same architecture can be reused to collect large
   amounts of compliance data.  Work from the TCG's TNC work group
   expands on this, enabling standardized communication of SWID Tags to
   a NEA server.  Based on these standards, SACM can define actions that
   can be performed on endpoint posture attributes to ensure compliance,
   including:

   1.  ensuring that all network-connected endpoints are known, and
       authorized to access network resources;

   2.  confirming that only authorized applications are running on the
       endpoint;

   3.  knowing that all applications are patched and up-to-date; and,

   4.  ensuring that applications with known vulnerabilities can be
       located and patched.

2.  Focus on a Way Forward

   In light of SACM's new focus and the need for quick wins that get
   SACM closer to its goals, we would like to open discussion on
   standardizing the collection, communication and evaluation of
   endpoint software load reports.  This meets a number of SACM use
   cases [I-D.ietf-sacm-use-cases].  Many of these standards already
   exist and are captured in the TCG's Endpoint Compliance Profile
   [Endpoint-Compliance-Profile].  Implementations are also publically
   available, such as the strongSwan TNC implementation [strongSwan].

3.  Existing Protocols and Schema for Internal Data Collection

   The Trusted Computing Group's TNC Work Group has additional standards
   that could be incorporated into the NEA architecture to specify how
   internal data collection can be used for security automation.  The
   Integrity Measurement Collector Interface (IF-IMC) [IF-IMC] could be
   used to describe a standardized interface between a posture collector
   and a NEA client on an endpoint.  Likewise, the Integrity Measurement
   Verifier Interface (IF-IMV) [IF-IMV] could provide an interface
   between a posture validator and a NEA Server.  Both of these
   standards are critical additions to the NEA architecture that improve
   the security and interoperability of the messaging between
   components.

   The SACM Information Model calls out a number of components that tie
   directly to the existing NEA architecture.  The Posture Collector
   described by NEA [RFC5209] is a SACM Internal Collector, and the
   Posture Validator is a SACM evaluator.  The PT-TLS protocol
   standardized by NEA addresses the SACM Information Model's security
   considerations by providing an authenticated, confidential channel
   through which posture attribute-value pairs can be communicated, with
   assurance that the communicated data has not been modified.

   In recent years, TNC has worked to specify SWID Message and
   Attributes for IF-M [SWID-Messages].  This standard uses NEA and TCG
   architectural elements to collect and validate software identities
   using the ISO Software Identification Tag Standard.  It also enables
   a NEA server to automate the storage of SWID tags for later
   evaluation, separating collection and evaluation roles.  Server
   Discovery and Validation [Server-Discovery] ensures that the endpoint
   only communicates with trusted servers.

4.  An Architecture for Internal Data Collection

   Using these standards, we can begin to build an architecture for
   internal data collection that addresses SACM's use cases.  An
   endpoint is connected to the network, and using the Server Discovery

   and Validation protocol, locates a trusted server, and connects to it
   over PT-TLS.  A SWID Collector gathers SWID tags from a directory on
   the endpoint, and communicates them over IF-IMC to the Posture Broker
   (PB) Client.  The Posture Broker Client then communicates this data
   to the Posture Transport Server via the Posture Broker Protocol
   [RFC5793].

   While NEA included validation capabilities on its server, SACM
   requires the separation of collection and evaluation.  Certain
   features of Posture Attribute validators, such as the evaluation of
   collected data against network policy or guidance, will be best
   performed at the data repository.  Other features, such as the
   ability to request data from an endpoint, should remain on the
   server.  SACM will have to decide how to best separate these
   function.  For now, a SACM Server will work as a place holder for the
   PB Server plus any functionality from the NEA Posture Validator that
   the group chooses to retain on the server.  The SACM Server will also
   be responsible for storing collected data in a data repository, where
   it will be made available to evaluators.

5.  Future Work

   This collection of standards provides a reasonable basis upon which
   we can build a SACM solution that focuses on the applications that
   are running on different types of endpoints, and the work that can be

   performed on this data when it is collected securely by an authorized
   server and stored in an data repository.  We intend, in the coming
   months, to ask the TNC to submit these standards to SACM for
   inclusion in our first version solution, as they meet our newly
   scoped goals of collecting state information from a subset of
   endpoint types.

   More work is needed to build out the capabilities in this set of
   standards.  Agreeing to use them as a starting point will clarify our
   work and help scope out future efforts.
