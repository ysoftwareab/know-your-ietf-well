1.  Introduction

   This memo describes a mode of opportunistic encryption [RFC7435] for
   802.11 -- OWE -- that provides encryption of the wireless medium but
   no authentication.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Notation

   This memo uses the following notation:

   y = F(X)
       an element-to-scalar mapping function.  For an elliptic curve
       group, it takes a point on the curve and returns the
       x-coordinate; for a finite field element it is the identity
       function, just returning the element itself.

   Z = DH(x,Y)
       for an elliptic curve DH(x,Y) is the multiplication of point Y by
       the scalar value x creating a point on the curve Z; for finite
       field cryptography DH(x,Y) is expontiation of element Y to the
       power of x (implied modulo a field defining prime, p) resulting
       in an element Z.

   a = len(b)
       indicates the length in bits of the string b.

2.  Background

   Many businesses-- bars, coffee shops, etc.-- offer free Wi-Fi as an
   inducement to customers to enter and remain in the premises.  Many
   customers will use the availability of free Wi-Fi as a deciding
   factor in which business to patronize.  Since these businesses are
   not Internet service providers, they are not willing and/or not
   qualified to perform complex configuration on their network.  In
   addition, customers are generally unwilling to do complicated
   provisioning on their devices just to obtain free Wi-Fi.  This leads
   to a popular deployment technique-- a network protected using a
   shared, and public PSK that is printed on a sandwich board at the
   entrance, on a chalkboard on the wall, or on a menu.  The PSK is used
   in a cryptographic handshake defined in [IEEE802.11] called the
   "4-way handshake" to prove knowledge of the PSK and derive traffic
   encryption keys for bulk wireless data.

   The belief is that this protects the wireless medium from passive
   sniffing and simple attacks.  That belief is erroneous.  Since the
   PSK is known by everyone, it is possible for a passive attacker to
   observe the 4-way Handshake and compute the traffic encryption keys
   used by a client and access point.  If the attacker is too late to
   observe this exchange, he can issue a forged "de-authenticate" frame
   that will cause the client and/or AP to reset the 802.11 state
   machine and cause them to go through the 4-way Handshake again
   thereby allowing the passive attacker to determine the traffic keys.

   Basically, this shared and public PSK mode of access is as bad as an
   open and unencrypted network.  [TODO: Explain trade offs; shared PSK
   means the attacker has to be active and could provide a false sense
   of security.]  With OWE, the client and AP, would perform a Diffie-
   Hellman key exchange during the access procedure and use the
   resulting pairwise secret with the 4-way Handshake, instead of using
   a shared and public PSK in the 4-way Handshake.

   OWE requires no special configuration or user interaction but
   provides a higher level of security than a common, shared, and public
   PSK.  OWE provides more security to the end user, while also being
   easier to use (no public keys to maintain, share, etc.).

3.  802.11 Network Access

   Wi-Fi Access Points advertise their presence through frames called
   "beacons".  These frames inform clients within earshot of the SSID
   the AP is advertising, the AP's MAC address (known as its "BSSID"),

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title                  July 2016


   security policy governing access, which symmetric ciphers it uses for
   unicast and broadcast frames, QoS information, as well as support for
   other optional features of [IEEE802.11].  Wi-Fi clients can actively
   discover APs by issuing "probe requests" which are queries for APs
   that respond with "probe responses".  A probe response carries
   essentially the same information as a beacon.

   After an AP is discovered by a client, actively through probing or
   passively through beacons, the client initiates a two-step method to
   gain network access.  The first step is "802.11 authentication".  For
   most methods of access (SAE being the exception), this is an empty
   exchange known as "Open Authentication-- basically the client says,
   "authenticate me", and the AP resonds "ok, you're authenticated".
   After 802.11 authentication is 802.11 association in which the client
   requests network access from an AP-- the SSID, a selection of the
   type of subsequent authentication to be made, any pairwise and group
   ciphers, etc-- using an 802.11 association request.  The AP
   acknowledges the request with an 802.11 association response.

   If the network is Open-- no authentication, no encryption-- the
   client has network access immediately after completion of 802.11
   association.  If the network enforces PSK authentication, the 4-way
   Handshake is initiated by the AP using the PSK to authenticate the
   client and derive traffic encryption keys.

   To add an opportunistic encryption mode of access to [IEEE802.11] it
   is necessary to perform a Diffie-Hellman key exchange during 802.11
   authentication and use the resulting pairwise secret with the 4-way
   Handshake.

4.  Opportunistic Wireless Encryption

4.1.  Cryptography

   Performing a Diffie-Hellman key exchange requires agreement on a
   domain parameter set in which to perform the exchange.  OWE uses a
   registry (see [IKE-IANA]) to map an integer into a complete domain
   parameter set.  OWE supports both elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)
   and finite field cryptography (FFC).

   OWE uses a hash algorithm for generation of a secret and a secret
   identifier.  The particular hash algorithm depends on the group
   chosen for the Diffie-Hellman.  For ECC, the hash algorithm depends
   on the size of the prime defining the curve, p:

   o  SHA-256: when len(p) <= 256

   o  SHA-384: when 256 < len(p) <= 384

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title                  July 2016


   o  SHA-512: when 384 < len(p)

   For FFC, the hash algorithm depends on the prime, p, defining the
   finite field:

   o  SHA-256: when len(p) <= 2048

   o  SHA-384: when 2048 < len(p) <= 3072

   o  SHA-512: when 3072 < len(p)

4.2.  OWE Discovery

   An access point advertises support for OWE using an Authentication
   and Key Management (AKM) suite identifer for OWE.  This AKM is
   illustrated in Table 1 and is added to the RSN Element in all beacons
   and probe responses that the AP issues.

                                  OWE AKM

   +----------+--------+-------------------+-------------+-------------+
   |   OUI    | Suite  |   Authentication  |     Key     |     Key     |
   |          |  Type  |        Type       | Manamgement |  derivation |
   |          |        |                   |     Type    |     type    |

   +----------+--------+-------------------+-------------+-------------+

                             Table 1: OWE AKM

   where ANA-1 is assigned by IEEE 802.11 ANA.

   Once a client discovers an OWE-compliant AP, it performs "Open
   System" 802.11 authentication as defined in [IEEE802.11], it then
   proceeds to 802.11 association.

4.3.  OWE Association

   Information is added to 802.11 association requests and responses by
   using TLVs that [IEEE802.11] calls "elements".  Each element has an
   "Element ID" (including any Element ID extension), a length, and a
   value field that is element-specific.  These elements are appended to
   each other to construct 802.11 associate requests and responses.

   OWE adds the Diffie-Hellman Parameter element (see Figure 1) to
   802.11 association requests and responses.  The client adds her

   public key in the 802.11 associate request and the AP adds his public
   key in the 802.11 associate response.

                   The Diffie-Hellman Parameter Element

      +------------+----------+------------+---------+--------------+

                                 Figure 1

   where

   o  ANA-2 is assigned by IEEE 802.11 ANA;

   o  group is an unsigned two-octet integer defined in [IKE-IANA], in
      little-endian format, that identifies a domain parameter set;

   o  public key is an octet string representing the Diffie-Hellman
      public key encoded according to section 2.3.3 (Elliptic Curve to
      Octet String Conversion) or 2.3.5 (Field Element to Octet String
      Conversion) of [SEC1] depending on whether the public key is ECC
      or FFC, respectively; and,

   o  Element ID, Length, and ID Extension are all single octet integers
      in little-endian format.

   A client wishing to do OWE MUST indicate the OWE AKM in the RSN
   element portion of the 802.11 association request, and MUST include a
   Diffie-Hellman Parameter element to its 802.11 association request.
   An AP agreeing to do OWE MUST include the OWE AKM in the RSN element
   portion of the 802.11 association response.  If "PMK caching" (see
   Section 4.5) is not performed, it MUST also include a Diffie-Hellman
   Parameter element.  If "PMK caching" is not being performed, a client
   MUST discard any 802.11 association response that indicates the OWE
   AKM in the RSN element but does not have not a Diffie-Hellman
   Parameter element.

   For interoperability purposes, a compliant implementation MUST
   support group nineteen (19), a 256-bit elliptic curve group.  TODO:
   what to do if the AP doesn't like the client's chosen group?

   Received Diffie-Hellman Parameter Elements are checked for validity
   upon receipt.  For ECC, elements are checked by verifying that
   equation for the curve is correct for the given x- and y-

   coordinates, excluding the point at infinity.  For FFC, elements are
   checked that they are between one (1) and one (1) less than the
   prime, p, exclusive (i.e. 1 < element < p-1).  Invalid received
   Diffie-Hellman keys MUST result in unsuccessful association and a
   failure of OWE.

4.4.  OWE Post-Association

   Once the client and AP have finished 802.11 association they finish
   the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and create a "pairwise master key"
   (PMK), and its associated identifier, PMKID.  Given a private key x,
   and the peer's (AP's if client, client's if AP) public key Y the
   following are generated:

      z = F(DH(x, Y))

      prk = HKDF-extract(NULL, z)

      PMK = HKDF-expand(prk, "OWE Key Generation", n)

   Where HKDF-expand() and HKDF-extract() are defined in [RFC5869], NULL
   indicates the "salt-less" invocation of HKDF using the hash algorithm
   defined in section Section 4.1, and n is the bitlength of the digest
   produced by that hash algorithm. z and prk are irretrievably deleted
   once the PMK has been generated.

   The PMKID is generated by hashing the two Diffie-Hellman public keys
   (the data, as sent and received, from the "public key" portion of the
   Diffie-Hellman Parameter element in the 802.11 Association request
   and response) and returning the left-most 128 bits:

      PMKID = Truncate-128(Hash(C | A))

   where C is the client's Diffie-Hellman public key from the 802.11
   Association request and A is the AP's Diffie-Hellman public key from
   the 802.11 Association response, and Hash is the hash algorithm
   defined in section Section 4.1.

   Upon completion of 802.11 association, the AP initiates the 4-way
   Handshake to the client using the PMK generated above.  The result of
   the 4-way Handshake are encryption keys to protect bulk unicast data
   and broadcast data.

4.5.  OWE PMK Caching

   [IEEE802.11] defines "PMK caching" where a client and access point
   can cache a PMK for a certain period of time and reuse it with the
   4-way Handshake after subsequent associations to bypass potentially



Harkins & Kumari        Expires January 19, 2017                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title                  July 2016


   expensive authentication.  A client indicates its desire to do "PMK
   caching" by including the identifying PMKID in its 802.11 association
   request.  If an AP has cached the PMK identified by that PMKID, it
   includes the PMKID in its 802.11 association response, otherwise it
   ignores the PMKID and proceeds with normal 802.11 association.  OWE
   supports the notion of "PMK caching".

   Since "PMK caching" is indicated in the same frame as the Diffie-
   Hellman Parameter element is passed, a client wishing to do "PMK
   caching" MUST include both in her 802.11 association request.  If the
   AP has the PMK identified by the PMKID and wishes to perform "PMK
   caching", he will include the PMKID in his 802.11 association
   response but does not include a Diffie-Hellman parameter element.  If
   the AP does not have the PMK identified by the PMKID, it ignores the
   PMKID and proceeds with normal OWE 802.11 association by including a
   Diffie-Hellman Parameeter element.

   When attempting "PMK caching" a client SHALL ignore any Diffie-
   Hellman Parameter element in an 802.11 association response that
   whose PMKID matches that of the client-issued 802.11 association
   request.  If the 802.11 association response does not include a
   PMKID, or if the PMKID does not match that of the client-issued
   802.11 association request, the client SHALL proceed with normal OWE
   association.

   The client SHALL ignore a PMKID in any 802.11 association response
   frame for which it did not include a PMKID in the corresponding
   802.11 association request frame.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

6.  Implementation Considerations

   OWE is a replacement for 802.11 "Open" authentication.  Therefore,
   when OWE-compliant access points are discovered, the presentation of
   the available SSID to users does not include special security symbols
   such as a graphic lock.  To a user, an OWE SSID is the same as
   "Open", it just provides more security behind the scenes.

7.  Security Considerations

   Opportunistic encryption does not provide authentication.  The client
   will have no authenticated identity for the Access Point, and vice
   versa.  They will share pairwise traffic encryption keys and have a
   cryptographic assurance that a frame claimed to be from the peer is
   actually from the peer and was not modified in flight.

   OWE is susceptible to an active attack in which an adversary
   impersonates an Access Point, induces a client to connect to it via
   OWE while it makes a connection to the legitimate Access Point.  In
   this particular attack, the adversary is able to inspect, modify, and
   forge any data between the client and legitimate Access Point.

   OWE is not a replacement for any authentication protocol specified in
   [IEEE802.11] and is not intended to be used when an alternative that
   provides real authentication is available.
