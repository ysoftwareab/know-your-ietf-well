Abstract

   This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module which
   contains Textual Conventions (TCs) to represent commonly-used
   Pseudowire (PW) management information.  The intent is that these TCs
   will be imported and used in PW-related MIB modules that would
   otherwise define their own representations.

1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines Textual Conventions used for Pseudowire
   (PW) technology and PWE3 MIB modules.

   Comments should be made directly to the PWE3 mailing list at
   pwe3@ietf.org.


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).  Objects
   in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure
   of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB module
   that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC
   2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [BCP14].

   This document adopts the definitions, acronyms and mechanisms
   described in [RFC3985].  Unless otherwise stated, the mechanisms of
   [RFC3985] apply and will not be described again here.

            additional value of zero. The zero value is object-specific
            and MUST therefore be defined as part of the description of
            any object which uses this syntax.  Examples of the usage of
            zero might include situations where Pseudowire was unknown,

5.  Security Considerations

   This module does not define any management objects.  Instead, it
   defines a set of textual conventions that may be used by other PWE3
   MIB modules to define management objects.

   Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB
   modules that define management objects.  Therefore, this document has
   no impact on the security of the Internet.


6.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): The IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.
