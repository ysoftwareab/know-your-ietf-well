   Abstract 
     
    This draft defines a portion of the Management Information Base for 
    use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based Internets. In 
    particular, it defines objects for configuring and controlling the    
    history collection of user specified Data, which is an ASN.1 
    INTEGER based object.

 1. 
    The Internet-Standard Management Framework 
     
    For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current 
    Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 
    of RFC 3410. 
     
    Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, 
    termed the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are 
    generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol 
    (SNMP). Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined 
    in the Structure of Management Information (SMI). This memo 
    specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is 
    described in STD 58, RFC2578 [RFC2578].

     Introduction 
     
    As the Internet continues to grow rapidly in size and complexity, 
    it has become increasingly clear that user needs the advanced

    monitoring capabilities. The statistical sampled data or history 
    data is an invaluable source of information for a wide range of 
    tasks such as network capacity planning, traffic monitoring and 
    fault diagnosis. Object definition for history collection is a 
    difficult task for a number of reasons. Firstly, object definition 
    must allow the user to specify any Data (an ASN.1 INTEGER based 
    object) for history collection. Secondly, the object definition 
    should enable the user to configure and control history collection 
    with one-configuration settings for the entire columnar objects. 
    Also the object definition should provide ability to select desired 
    instances from the list of instances of a given columnar object. As 
    the need for alarm generation forms a part of monitoring the user 
    requires an object definition provision for configuring the alarm 
    generation as well. 
     
    Some of these above mentioned challenges, such as user specific 
    history collection and alarm generation is being addressed by the 
    IETF working group, Remote Network Monitoring, rmonmib. As there 
    are several challenges the user faces while configuring the 
    monitoring using the available standard object definitions, the 
    user needs a advanced features for configuring and controlling 
    history collection. This document proposes the object definition 
    for a sophisticated and easy mechanism for configuration and 
    control of history collection. 
     
 3. 
    Terminology 
     
    The following is a list of terms that are used in this draft,  
     
    Scalar Objects  
     
    Scalar objects define a singular object instance. No dynamic 
    creation or destruction of the instance will be observed for a 
    given scalar object and hence the scalar objects have exactly one 
    object instance. 
     
    Tabular Objects  
     
    It is convenient for the developers of management applications to 
    impose imaginary, tabular structures on the ordered collection of 
    objects that constitute the MIB termed as SNMP conceptual table. 
    Hence the tabular objects define multiple related object instances 
    that are grouped in MIB tables. A table may have multiple rows, 
    which may be static or dynamically created and destroyed. Each 
    table is represented by a tabular object, which has an assigned OID 
    in the MIB. 
     
    Columnar Objects 
     

  
 Yadawad, et al.         Expires - August 2004                [Page 3] 
  
 Advanced History Collection Framework                       March 2004 

    Every tabular object contains zero or more rows, and each row may 
    contain one or more objects, termed columnar objects. A columnar 
    object represents multiple object instances of columns of two-
    dimensional tables. A tabular object can have one or multiple 
    instances of Conceptual row object, each of which contains an 
    instance for each columnar object in the table.  
     
    Identifier Objects  
     
    These represent a set of Columnar Object instances, whose values 
    will uniquely identify a row in any SNMP table. These values must 
    remain unchanged as long as the underlying resource they represent 
    remains unchanged. The specific columnar object instances, which 
    can serve as Identifier Objects, are dependent upon the table 
    definition and also the implementation of the table. Any column 
    object instances can be used as Identifier Objects, so long as they 
    are guaranteed to have unique values among all the rows of the 
    table. 
     
    Filter Criteria 
     
    A Filter criterion is made of two parts: A filter specification and 
    a filter type. The Filter specification defines values of 
    Identifier Objects. Any instances of an SNMP table whose Identifier 
    Object's values match the Filter specification considered satisfy 
    the filter criteria. The Filter type specifies whether instances, 
    which match the specification, must be considered for history 
    collection or must be ignored for history collection. 
      
    Monitoring covers both 
     
    Passive and active traffic generation sources. 
     
 4. 
    Advanced History collection Framework 
     
    The Advanced History collection Framework MIB has three groups 
    providing the MIB objects (ahcfObjects), notification definitions 
    (ahcfNotifications) and conformance definitions (ahcfConformance).  
     
    The ahcfObjects group consists of three tables and one scalar 
    group. 
     
        1. ahcfConfigTable 
        2. ahcfInstanceTable 
        3. ahcfSampleTable 
        4. ahcfSysInfo 
     
    ahcfConfigTable:

 Advanced History Collection Framework                       March 2004 

    The ahcfConfigTable stores configuration entries that each defines 
    a user specified Data, polling period and other parameters for 
    controlling the history collection.  
     
    ahcfConfigTable is an one-dimensional read-create table. The 
    management station MUST configure this table prior to using any 
    functionality of this framework. When a management station needs to 
    create a row in the ahcfConfigTable, it must provide at least the 
    object identifier of the particular MIB variable to be sampled 
    (ahcfConfigObjectVariable) and its type (ahcfConfigObjectType, 
    whether scalar or columnar).  Each row created in the 
    ahcfConfigTable corresponds to one or more associated rows in 
    ahcfInstanceTable.  
     
        When a management station successfully creates a row in this 
    table, the agent must check the OID type (ahcfConfigObjectType) of 
    the created row. If the ahcfConfigObjectType is columnar, the agent 
    MUST find out all the instances of the ahcfConfigObjectVariable and 
    create a row in ahcfInstanceTable for each instance. Incase 
    ahcfConfigObjectType is scalar, the agent MUST create one row in 
    the ahcfInstanceTable for ahcfConfigObjectVariable. If a row in 
    ahcfConfigTable is deleted or deactivated, the agent MUST delete 
    all associated entries in the ahcfInstanceTable and the 
    ahcfSampleTable.  
     
        Each row in ahcfConfigTable with ahcfConfigObjectType as 
    columnar MAY be associated with a set of identifier variables. The 
    identifier variables are a set of columnar variables of the same 
    MIB table as the ahcfConfigObjectVariable, whose values will 
    uniquely identify a row in the MIB table. The agent SHALL use the 
    identifier variables to uniquely identify a row in the MIB table 
    across many reboots of the SNMP agent or the host machine running 
    the SNMP agent.  
     
        The management station MAY choose to configure history 
    collection on specific instances of the ahcfConfigObjectVariable 
    through filters. 
     
    ahcfInstanceTable: 
     
     This table is a 2-d read-write table. Agent MUST populate this 
    table based on a row created in ahcfConfigTable. Each row of this 
    table is associated with only one row of ahcfConfigTable and the 
    row inherits common settings from the corresponding row in 
    ahcfConfigTable. The management station MAY also configure settings 
    for each row of this table.  
        Once a row is created in the ahcfInstanceTable, the agent MUST 
    start history collection such that a sample will be taken at the 
    next hour boundary. A sample MUST be collected and the value stored 
    in ahcfSampleTable at the specified intervals. Each row in the

 Advanced History Collection Framework                       March 2004 

    ahcfSampleTable denotes a sample collected for a row of the 
    ahcfInstanceTable over a specific interval. 
     
        Once the number of samples reach ahcfInstanceBucketsRequested 
    value, the oldest samples must be overwritten with the new samples 
    and number of samples will stay at ahcfInstanceBucketsRequested 
    value. If a row's trending status (ahcfInstanceTrendingState) is 
    disabled, agent must not collect the samples until 
    ahcfInstanceTrendingState is enabled.  
     
    If threshold checking for this row is enabled 
    (ahcfInstanceThresholdState) , the sample value at each interval 
    MUST be compared with threshold parameters configured and a 
    notification MUST be sent if a violation is detected. The agent 
    MUST also handle changes in the MIB table that 
    ahcfConfigObjectVariable belongs to if the ahcfConfigObjectType is 
    columnar (such as a row addition, removal or change in the order of 
    instances).  
     
    ahcfSampleTable: 
     
    The ahcfSampleTable is a 3-d read-only table containing the sample 
    data of associated rows in the ahcfInstanceTable. Each entry 
    represents the value of a single MIB instance during a specific 
    sampling interval (or the rate of change during the interval). A 
    sample value is stored in two objects an absolute value and a 
    status object. This allows numbers from -(2G-1) to +4G to be 
    stored.  The status object also indicates whether a sample is 
    valid. This allows data collection to continue if periodic 
    retrieval of a particular instance fails for any reason. 
     
    ahcfSysInfo: 
     
    This is a scalar group which must be filled by agent contains date, 
    time and time zone of the agent machine. 
     
    ahcfNotifications: 
     
    The ahcfNotifications group contains the notification variable 
    definitions and notification definitions. 
     
    ahcfConformance: 
     
    The ahcfConformance group contains the conformance definitions for 
    the AHCF-MIB.

    Diagram Description: 
     
    When the user configures an entry, e.g. Entry1, in the 
    ahcfConfigTable, on successful creation of the ahcfConfigTable, the 
    probe will create one or more entries in the ahcfInstanceTable 
    e.g.Entry11.The number of entries created in the ahcfInstanceTable 
    depends on total number of instances associated with entry in 
    ahcfInstanceTable. The probe has to apply filter criteria and 
    access control in order to determine the total number entries to be 
    created in the ahcfInstanceTable. On creation of an entry in the 
    ahcfInstanceTable a entry gets created in the ahcfSampleTable, e.g. 
    Entry111.

    Features of this Architecture 
     
    The proposed draft apart from containing the mechanisms seen in the 
    alarm and usrHistory groups of RMON2 contains also the additional 
    features and functionality. 
     
    Suppose if the user needs to collect history for all the instances 
    of a columnar object say e.g., on the interface related statistics 
    (ifTable of MIB-II) like packets sent for all the interfaces by 
    using the usrHistory group object definition, the user is required 
    to carry out configuration for each instance separately. The 
    usrHistory group does not provide a single point of configuration 
    for all the instances of the columnar objects. 
        
    The basic goals of this draft are to address some special 
    requirements that arise because of the above consideration in the 
    form of feature offerings. These requirements and features are 
    listed below: 
     
  
 5.1 
     Simple configuration and Instance Management: 
      
    Objective: It must be possible to configure and control the history 
    collection for all the instances of the columnar object in a simple 
    way. 
     
    The OID of a columnar object variable consists of two parts: a 
    columnar OID and an index. 
     
    Usually, the index part of the OID is defined by implementers of 
    the MIB or is dependent on the specific type of the parameter that 
    is being monitored. Hence it can have arbitrary values. Also, these 
    indices can vary from machine to machine. For example, the index of 
    the ifTable is a column called ifIndex. The value of this ifIndex 
    is not pre-determined and can be any arbitrary integer value. It is 
    difficult for a user to determine the complete OID for such 
    parameter.  
     
    There is another problem that arises vis-€-vis the history 
    collection of columnar variables. The numbers of instances for 
    these parameters are not fixed. This means that there could be new 
    instances that are added or existing ones removed, as per the 
    dynamic behavior of the system being monitored. For example, new 
    interfaces added to the system could result in new rows in the 
    ifTable. Interfaces removed would result in the deletion of 
    existing rows. It becomes difficult if an user needs to keep track 
    of these additions and deletions and make sure that the history 
    collection configuration reflects these changes. 
     
  
 Yadawad, et al.         Expires - August 2004                [Page 8] 
  
 Advanced History Collection Framework                       March 2004 

     A simple resolution to these kind of requirement being providing 
    the capability to the user to define only the columnar part of the 
    OID and allow the implementing application to find all the 
    instances of the table automatically. At the same time, this would 
    also allow the agent to keep track of additions and deletions that 
    occur as stated above. 
     
     
 5.2 
     Consistent reference to the resource:  
     
    It must be possible to track changing instances and automatically 
    adjust the history collection. 
     
    Normally, the index part of columnar variables maps to an instance 
    of the system resource being monitored. However, if the resource 
    being monitored changes, it could result in a change to the index 
    part of the columnar variables also. As it is again left to 
    implementation what the index part is, there is no guarantee that 
    an index is mapped to the same instance of the system resource 
    always.  
     
    For example, consider the hrSWRunTable table in the Host resources 
    MIB. The index of this table is again an integer valued variable 
    called hrSWRunIndex. The HTTP server process might initially be 
    associated with index 7219. However, if it is restarted, it could 
    get the index 9029. Also, it is likely that a row with index 7219 
    might actually represent a new process  
    like notepad.exe.  
     
    If some columnar variable related to the above table need 
    statistical sampling, it cannot rely just on the OID of that 
    variable. It may result in the data not being collected for the 
    instance even if it is actually available. Or worse, it may collect 
    incorrect data assuming that the OID still represents the same 
    instance. It is also very difficult for an user to keep these 
    synchronized. 
     
    Strictly speaking, this problem should not arise if the indices of  
    tables are defined and implemented in such a way that their mapping 
    to the underlying resource is ensured to be always unique. However, 
    it is observed in practice that indices of tables are usually just 
    integer valued numbers. It is also observed that there would be 
    other columns in the table which identify the resources in a more 
    permanent manner. For example, in the  
    case of the hrSWRunTable, the name of the software could serve as a 
    good identifier. 
     
    This problem is addressed by introducing a concept of  
    'Identifier Object'. The Identifier Objects are one or more 
    Columnar Objects that will serve to uniquely identify one instance

    among several ones of selected columnar objects. The MIB definition 
    allows the user to associate Identifier Objects to the columnar 
    Object being sampled. By doing so, it is now left to the monitoring 
    application to make sure that data is being collected for the right 
    resource even if it changes with time. 
     
 5.3 
       Instance Filtering:  
     
    It must be possible to selectively collect history on certain 
    instances of a columnar object. 
     
    Sometimes, the user may not be interested in all the instances of a 
    given table. In such a case, user can specify the OIDs of the 
    specific instances of interest. However, as described in the above 
    points, specifying the complete OID will again have a problem if 
    there is a change to the index part of such instances.  
     
    For example, consider again the hrSWRunTable in the Host resources 
    MIB. This would include all processes running on the system. 
    However the user might be interested in monitoring only certain 
    important processes like a HTTP server or other major services.  
     
    The current draft allows the user to define filter criteria 
    specifying the instances to be monitored. The monitoring 
    application can now ensure that instances satisfying these criteria 
    can be monitored. Combined with the other points mentioned above, 
    this would handle cases where instances satisfying the criteria get 
    added, removed or modified. 
     
 5.4 
      Threshold Monitoring:  
     
    Combining the aspect of threshold monitoring with history 
    collection: 
     
    In addition to the above considerations, the current object 
    definition also tries to combine the functionality of threshold-
    based monitoring with the history collection functionality. It 
    allows the user to define thresholds on the data being monitored. 
    Any violation of the threshold would result in a notification being 
    generated.

    Discussion 
  
    Alternate Design Considered: 
     
    An extension to the usrHistory Group of RMON was considered as an 
    alternate design for satisfying the proposed goals.  
     
    One approach considered was to create a new table to define the 
    entries like columnar variables, identifiers variables and filter 
  
 Yadawad, et al.         Expires - August 2004               [Page 10] 
  
 Advanced History Collection Framework                       March 2004 

    criteria. Based on these settings, the monitoring application could 
    have created corresponding control and object entries as per the 
    definition of the usrHistory group. 
     
    Another approach considered was to extend the definitions of the 
    existing usrHistory group. In this the control table would be 
    extended to include the columnar variables, identifier variables 
    and filter criteria. The object entries would then be populated as 
    per the definition of the usrHistory group. 
     
    The main reason for not choosing these approaches was that they 
    seemed to result in complex implementations and also break 
    compatibility with the existing definition of the usrHistory group. 
    Some of the issues in the above approaches are mentioned below: 
     
    1. The usrHistory group allows clubbing unrelated OIDs as Object 
    Entries under a single Control Entry. While this is a very generic 
    and flexible design, it creates certain design issues while 
    implementing the functionality described above. For the sake of 
    simplicity, it should be possible to map a control entry to 
    'related' Object Entries - like all the instances of a given 
    columnar parameter should ideally be in one Control Entry. This 
    would make it very easy to operate on these instances as a group 
    like setting similar configurations for these or enabling/disabling 
    their trending simultaneously.  
     
    If expanded in this manner, issues arise with the existing 
    definition of the usrHistory group. For example, should it allow 
    addition of Object entries of unrelated OIDs to this control entry 
    or not. To solve these issues, either the MIB definition needs to 
    be changed or it needs to be left to the implementations, leading 
    to ambiguous implementations. 
     
    2. Some parts of the definition of the usrHistory group conflicted 
    with the requirements. For instance, the Sampling Interval was an 
    object that could be different for different instances of a column 
    being trended. Parameters related to the loop back interface of the 
    ifTable could be monitored more slowly than the other interfaces. 
    To fit in these requirements would result in duplication of 
    parameters between the Control Entry and Object Entry table. Or it 
    would result in a change to the RFC that breaks backward 
    compatibility. 
     
    The current draft attempts to provide a simple and clean design 
    that solves the requirements that were considered.

    Form (BNF) as described in RFC-2234.

 -- ================================================================ 
 -- Advanced History Collection Framework MIB (ahcfMIB) 
 -- ================================================================ 
  
 -- The Advanced History Collection Framework MIB combines  
 -- mechanisms seen in the alarm and history groups of RMON mib to  
 -- provide user-specified history collection, utilizing two  
 -- additional control tables and one additional data table. This  
 -- function has traditionally been done by NMS applications, via  
 -- periodic polling.  The ahcf group allows this task to be  
 -- offloaded to an SNMP probe. Data (an ASN.1 INTEGER based object)  
 -- is collected in the same manner as any history data table (e.g.  
 -- etherHistoryTable) except that the user specifies the MIB  
 -- variable which needs to be collected. The user can specify a  
 -- scalar variable (a leaf object that can have only one instance)  
 -- or a columnar variable (an object that appears in a mib table  
 -- which can have several instances) for history collection. 
       
 -- The ahcfObjects group has three tables and one scalar group. 
 -- 
 --        1. ahcfConfigTable 
 --        2. ahcfInstanceTable 
 --        3. ahcfSampleTable 
 --        4. ahcfSysInfo 
  
 --   ahcfConfigTable: 
 -- ================================================================    
 --   ahcfConfigTable is an one-dimensional read-create table. The  
 --   management station MUST configure this table prior to using any  
 --   functionality of this framework. When a management station needs  
 --   to create a row in the ahcfConfigTable, it MUST provide at least  
 --   the object identifier of the particular MIB variable to be  
 --   sampled (ahcfConfigObjectVariable) and its type  
 --   ahcfConfigObjectType, whether scalar or columnar).   
 --   Each row created in the ahcfConfigTable corresponds to one or  
 --   more associated rows in ahcfInstanceTable.  
  
 --   When a management station successfully creates a row in this

 --   table, the agent MUST check the oid type (ahcfConfigObjectType)  
 --   of the created row. If the ahcfConfigObjectType is columnar, the  
 --   agent MUST find out all the instances of the  
 --   ahcfConfigObjectVariable and create a row in ahcfInstanceTable   
 --   for each instance. Incase ahcfConfigObjectType is scalar, the  
 --   agent MUST create one row in the ahcfInstanceTable for  
 --   ahcfConfigObjectVariable. If a row in is ahcfConfigTable deleted  
 --   or deactivated, the agent MUST delete all associated entries in  
 --   the ahcfInstanceTable and the ahcfSampleTable. Each row in  
 --   ahcfConfigTable with ahcfConfigObjectType as columnar MAY be  
 --   associated with a set of identifier variables. The identifier  
 --   variables are a set of columnar variables of the same MIB table  
 --   as the ahcfConfigObjectVariable, whose values will uniquely  
 --   identify a row in the MIB table. The agent SHALL use the  
 --   identifier variables to uniquely identify a row in the MIB table  
 --   across many reboots of the SNMP agent or the host machine  
 --   running the SNMP agent.  
       
 --   The management station MAY choose to configure history  
 --   collection on specific instances of the ahcfConfigObjectVariable  
 --   through filters.  
  
 --   ahcfInstanceTable: 
 -- ================================================================    
 --   This table is a 2-d read-write table. Agent MUST populate this  
 --   table based on a row created in ahcfConfigTable. Each row of  
 --   this table is associated with only one row of ahcfConfigTable  
 --   and the row inherits common settings from the corresponding row  
 --   in ahcfConfigTable. The management station MAY also configure  
 --   settings for each row of this table.  
  
 --   Once a row is created in the ahcfInstanceTable, the agent MUST  
 --   start history collection such that a sample will be taken at the  
 --   next hour boundary. A sample MUST be collected and the value  
 --   stored in ahcfSampleTable at the specified intervals. Each row  
 --   in the ahcfSampleTable denotes a sample collected for a row of  
 --   the ahcfInstanceTable over a specific interval. Once the number  
 --   of samples reach ahcfInstanceBucketsRequested value, the oldest  
 --   samples MUST be overwritten with the new samples and number of  
 --   samples will stay at ahcfInstanceBucketsRequested value. If a  
 --   row's trending status (ahcfInstanceTrendingState) is disabled,  
 --   agent MUST not collect the samples until  
 --   ahcfInstanceTrendingState is enabled. If threshold checking for  
 --   this row is enabled (ahcfInstanceThresholdState) , the sample

 --   value at each interval MUST be compared with threshold  
 --   parameters configured and a notification MUST be sent if a  
 --   violation is detected. The agent MUST also handle changes in the  
 --   MIB table that ahcfConfigObjectVariable belongs to if the  
 --   ahcfConfigObjectType is columnar (such as a row addition,  
 --   removal or change in the order of instances). 
  
 --   ahcfSampleTable: 
 -- ================================================================    
 --   The ahcfSampleTable is a 3-d read-only table containing the  
 --   sample data of associated rows in the ahcfInstanceTable. Each  
 --   entry represents the value of a single MIB instance during a  
 --   specific sampling interval (or the rate of change during the  
 --   interval). A sample value is stored in two objects an absolute  
 --   value and a status object. This allows numbers from -(2G-1) to  
 --   +4G to be stored.  The status object also indicates whether a  
 --   sample is valid. This allows data collection to continue if  
 --   periodic retrieval of a particular instance fails for any  
 --   reason. 
       
 --   ahcfSysInfo: 
 -- ================================================================ 
  
 --   This is a scalar group which provides the date, time and Time  
 --   zone of the agent machine. 
       
 --   ahcfNotifications: 
 --   The ahcfNotifications group contains the notification variable  
 --   definitions and notification definitions. 
  
 --   ahcfConformance:  
 --   The ahcfConformance group contains the conformance definitions 
 for 
 --   the AHCF-MIB.

                variable the agent cannot detect that the second row

    Security Considerations 
     
    There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module 
    with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such 
    objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
    environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
    environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
    network operations. 
     
    The following objects are defined with a MAX-ACCESS clause of 
    read-write or read-create:

    SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
    Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), 
    even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is 
    allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the 
    objects in this MIB module. 
     
    It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features 
    as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), 
    including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for 
    authentication and privacy). 
     
    Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
    RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
    enable cryptographic security.  It is then a user's responsibility 
    to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this 
    MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects 
    only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to 
    indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
