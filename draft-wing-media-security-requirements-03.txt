Internet-Draft         Media Security Requirements              May 2007


1.  Introduction

   The work on media security started a long time ago where the
   capability of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) was still at its
   infancy.  With the increased SIP deployment and the availability of
   new SIP extensions and related protocols the need for end-to-end
   security was re-evaluated.  The procedure of re-evaluating prior
   protocol work and design decisions is not an uncommon strategy and,
   to some extend, considered necessary protocol work to ensure that the
   developed protocols indeed meet the previously envisioned needs for
   the users in the Internet.

   This document aims to summarize the discussed media security
   requirements, i.e., requirements for mechanisms that negotiate keys
   for SRTP.  Once the list of requirements and architectural aspects
   have been investigated, the work on the protocol proposals can be
   progressed by identifying a small number of soltuions and to complete
   the protocol work.

   This document is organized as follows.  Section 2 introduces
   terminology, Section 3 provides an overview about possible call
   scenarios, Section 4 lists requirements for media security, Section 5
   will provide a clustering of requirements to certain deployment
   environments to adress the problem that there might not be a single
   solution with universal applicability and Appendix A provides out-of-
   scope items and aspects for further discussion.  The document
   concludes with a security considerations Section 6, IANA
   considerations Section 7 and an acknowledgement section in Section 8.


2.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Discussion of Call Scenarios

   The following subsections describe call scenarios, which have been
   discussed elaborately.  These call scenarios pose the most challenge
   to the key management for media data in cooperation with SIP
   signaling.  The scenarios have already been described as part of the
   key management evaluation draft [I-D.wing-rtpsec-keying-eval], and
   are stated here to give a better insight in these discussion.

Internet-Draft         Media Security Requirements              May 2007


3.1.  Clipping Media Before Signaling Answer

   Per the SDP Offer/Answer Model [RFC3264],

      "Once the offerer has sent the offer, it MUST be prepared to
      receive media for any recvonly streams described by that offer.
      It MUST be prepared to send and receive media for any sendrecv
      streams in the offer, and send media for any sendonly streams in
      the offer (of course, it cannot actually send until the peer
      provides an answer with the needed address and port information)."

   To meet this requirement with SRTP, the offerer needs to know the
   SRTP key for arriving media.  If encrypted SRTP media arrives before
   the associated SRTP key, the offerer cannot play the media -- causing
   clipping.

   For key exchange mechanisms that send the answerer's key in SDP, a
   SIP provisional response [RFC3261], such as 183 (session progress),
   is useful.  However, the 183 messages are not reliable unless both
   the calling and called end point support PRACK [RFC3262], use TCP
   across all SIP proxies, implement Security Preconditions
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-securityprecondition], or the both ends implement
   ICE [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice] and the answerer implements the reliable
   provisional response mechanism described in ICE.  Unfortunately,
   there is not wide deployment of any of these techniques and there is
   industry reluctance to set requirements regarding these techniques to
   avoid the problem described in this section.

   Note that the receipt of an SDP answer is not always sufficient to
   allow media to be played to the offerer.  Sometimes, the offerer must
   send media in order to open up firewall holes or NAT bindings before
   media can be received.  In this case a solution that makes the key
   available before the SDP answer arrives will not help.

   Requirements are created due to early media, in the sense of pre-
   offer/answer media, as described in [I-D.barnes-sip-em-ps-req-sol].
   Fixes to early media might make the requirements to become obsolete.

3.2.  Retargeting and Forking

   In SIP, a request sent to a specific AOR but delivered to a different
   AOR is called a "retarget".  A typical scenario is a "call
   forwarding" feature.  In Figure 1 Alice sends an Invite in step 1
   that is sent to Bob in step 2.  Bob responds with a redirect (SIP
   response code 3xx) pointing to Carol in step 3.  This redirect
   typically does not propagate back to Alice but only goes to a proxy
   (i.e., the retargeting proxy) that sends the original Invite to Carol
   in step 4.

                           Figure 1: Retargeting

   The mechanism used by SIP for identifying the calling party is SIP
   Identity [RFC3261].  However, due to SIP retargeting issues
   [I-D.peterson-sipping-retarget], SIP Identity can only identify the
   calling party (that is, the party that initiated the SIP request).
   Some key exchange mechanisms predate SIP Identity and include their
   own identity mechanism.  However, those built-in identity mechanism
   suffer from the same SIP retargeting problem described in the above
   draft.  Going forward, it is anticipated that Connected Identity
   [I-D.ietf-sip-connected-identity] may allow identifying the called
   party.  This is also described as the 'retargeting identity' problem.

   In SIP, 'forking' is the delivery of a request to multiple locations.
   This happens when a single AOR is registered more than once.  An
   example of forking is when a user has a desk phone, PC client, and
   mobile handset all registered with the same AOR.

                             Figure 2: Forking

   With forking, both Bob-1 and Bob-2 might send back SDP answers in SIP
   responses.  Alice will see those intermediate (18x) and final (200)
   responses.  It is useful for Alice to be able to associate the SIP
   response with the incoming media stream.  Although this association
   can be done with ICE [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice], and ICE is useful to make
   this association with RTP, it is not desirable to require ICE to
   accomplish this association.

   Forking and retargeting are often used together.  For example, a boss
   and secretary might have both phones ring and rollover to voice mail
   if neither phone is answered.

   To maintain security of the media traffic, only the end point that
   answers the call should know the SRTP keys for the session.  This is
   only an issue with public key encryption and not with DH-based
   approaches.  For key exchange mechanisms that do not provide secure
   forking or secure retargeting, one workaround is to re-key
   immediately after forking or retargeting (that is, perform a re-
   Invite).  However, because the originator may not be aware that the
   call forked this mechanism requires rekeying immediately after every
   session is established.  This doubles the Invite messages processed
   by the network.

   Retargeting securely introduces a more significant problem.  With
   retargeting, the actual recipient of the request is not the original
   recipient.  This means that if the offerer encrypted material (such
   as the session key or the SDP) using the original recipient's public
   key, the actual recipient will not be able to decrypt that material
   because the recipient won't have the original recipient's private
   key.  In some cases, this is the intended behavior, i.e., you wanted



Wing, et al.            Expires November 23, 2007               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft         Media Security Requirements              May 2007


   to establish a secure connection with a specific individual.  In
   other cases, it is not intended behavior (you want all voice media to
   be encrypted, regardless of who answers).

   For some forms of key management the calling party needs to know in
   advance the certificate or shared secret of the called party, and
   retargeting can interfere with this.

   Further compounding this problem is a particularity of SIP that when
   forking is used, there is always only one final error response
   delivered to the sender of the request: the forking proxy is
   responsible for choosing which final response to choose in the event
   where forking results in multiple final error responses being
   received by the forking proxy.  This means that if a request is
   rejected, say with information that the keying information was
   rejected and providing the far end's credentials, it is very possible
   that the rejection will never reach the sender.  This problem, called
   the Heterogeneous Error Response Forking Problem (HERFP)
   [I-D.mahy-sipping-herfp-fix], is difficult to solve in SIP.

3.3.  Shared Key Conferencing

   For efficient scaling, large audio and video conference bridges
   operate most efficiently by encrypting the current speaker once and
   distributing that stream to the conference attendees.  Typically,
   inactive participants receive the same streams -- they hear (or see)
   the active speaker(s), and the active speakers receive distinct
   streams that don't include themselves.  In order to maintain
   confidentiality of such conferences where listeners share a common
   key, all listeners must rekeyed when a listener joins or leaves a
   conference.

   An important use case for mixers/translators is a conference bridge:


                                         +----+
                             A --- 1 --->|    |
                               <-- 2 ----| M  |
                                         | I  |
                             B --- 3 --->| X  |
                               <-- 4 ----| E  |
                                         | R  |
                             C --- 5 --->|    |
                               <-- 6 ----|    |
                                         +----+

   In the figure above, 1, 3, and 5 are RTP media contributions from
   Alice, Bob, and Carol, and 2, 4, and 6 are the RTP flows to those
   devices carrying the 'mixed' media.

   Several scenarios are possible:

   a.  Multiple inbound sessions: 1, 3, and 5 are distinct RTP sessions,

   b.  Multiple outbound sessions: 2, 4, and 6 are distinct RTP
       sessions,

   c.  Single inbound session: 1, 3, and 5 are just different sources
       within the same RTP session,

   d.  Single outbound session: 2, 4, and 6 are different flows of the
       same (multi-unicast) RTP session

   If there are multiple inbound sessions and multiple outbound sessions
   (scenarios a and b), then every keying mechanism behaves as if the
   mixer were an end point and can set up a point-to-point secure
   session between the participant and the mixer.  This is the simplest
   situation, but is computationally wasteful, since SRTP processing has
   to be done independently for each participant.  The use of multiple
   inbound sessions (scenario a) doesn't waste computational resources,
   though it does consume additional cryptographic context on the mixer
   for each participant and has the advantage of non-repudiation of the
   originator of the incoming stream.

   To support a single outbound session (scenario d), the mixer has to
   dictate its encryption key to the participants.  Some keying
   mechanisms allow the transmitter to determine its own key, and others
   allow the offerer to determine the key for the offerer and answerer.
   Depending on how the call is established, the offerer might be a
   participant (such as a participant dialing into a conference bridge)
   or the offerer might be the mixer (such as a conference bridge
   calling a participant).  The use of offerless Invites may help some
   keying mechanisms reverse the role of offerer/answerer.  A
   difficulty, however, is knowing a priori if the role should be
   reversed for a particular call.


4.  Requirements

   R1:    Negotiation of SRTP keys MUST NOT cause the call setup to fail
          in forked and retargeted calls where all end points are
          willing to use SRTP, unless the execution of the
          authentication and key exchange protocol leads to a failure
          (e.g., an unsuccessful authentication attempt).

Internet-Draft         Media Security Requirements              May 2007


   R2:    Even when some end points of a forked or retargeted call are
          incapable of using SRTP, the key management protocol MUST
          allow the establishment of SRTP associations with SRTP-capable
          endpoints and RTP associations with non-SRTP-capable
          endpoints.

   R3:    Forked end points SHOULD NOT know the SRTP key of any call
          established with another forked end point.  [Editor's Note:
          'SHOULD NOT' might be turned into a 'MUST NOT']

   R4:    A solution MAY support the ability to utilize an initially
          established security context that was established as part of
          the first call setup with a remote end point.

          Specialized devices may need to avoid public key operations or
          Diffie-Hellman operations as much as possible because of the
          computational cost or because of the additional call setup
          delay.  For example, it can take a second or two to perform a
          Diffie-Hellman operation in certain devices.  Examples of
          these specialized devices would include some handsets,
          intelligent SIMs, and PSTN gateways.  For the typical case
          because a phone call has not yet been established, ancillary
          processing cycles can be utilized to perform the PK or DH
          operation; for example, in a PSTN gateway the DSP, which is
          not yet involved with typical DSP operations, could be used to
          perform the calculation, so as to avoid having the central
          host processor perform the calculation.  Some devices, such as
          handsets, and intelligent SIMs do not have such ancillary
          processing capability.

   R5:    A solution SHOULD avoid clipping media before SDP answer
          without requiring PRACK [RFC3262].

   R6:    A solution MUST provide protection against passive attacks on
          the media path and MUST protect against passive attacks of a
          SIP proxy that is legitimately routing SIP messages.

   R7:    A solution MUST be able to support Perfect Forward Secrecy.

   R8:    A solution MUST support negotiation of the key exchange
          algorithm without incurring per-algorithm computational
          expense.

   R9:    A solution MUST support multiple SRTP cipher suites without
          additional computational expense.

Internet-Draft         Media Security Requirements              May 2007


   R10:   A solution that utilizes expensive cryptographic computations
          SHOULD offer the ability to resume previous sessions in an
          efficient way.

          For example, if using a Diffie-Hellman keying technique with
          security preconditions that forks to 20 end points, the call
          initiator would get 20 provisional responses containing 20
          signed Diffie-Hellman key pairs.  Calculating 20 DH secrets
          and validating signatures can be a difficult task depending on
          the device capabilities.  Hence, in the case of forking, it is
          not desirable to perform a DH or PK operation with every
          party, but rather only with the party that answers the call
          (and incur some media clipping).

   R11:   A solution MUST NOT require 3rd parties to sign certificates.

          This requirement points to the fact that a global PKI cannot
          be assumed and opportunistic security approaches should be
          considered in the solution.

   R12:   A solution SHOULD use algorithms that allow FIPS 140-2
          [FIPS-140-2] certification.

          Note that the United States Government can only purchase and
          use crypto implementations that have been validated by the
          FIPS-140 [FIPS-140-2] process:

          "The FIPS-140 standard is applicable to all Federal agencies
          that use cryptographic-based security systems to protect
          sensitive information in computer and telecommunication
          systems, including voice systems.  The adoption and use of
          this standard is available to private and commercial
          organizations."[cryptval]

          Some commercial organizations, such as banks and defense
          contractors, also require or prefer equipment which has
          validated by the FIPS-140 process.

   R13:   A solution for authentication and key exchange SHOULD be able
          to associate the signaling exchange with the media traffic.

   R14:   A solution SHOULD allow to start with RTP and then upgrade to
          SRTP.

   R15:   A solution SHOULD not introduce new denial of service
          vulnerabilities.

Internet-Draft         Media Security Requirements              May 2007


   R16:   A solution SHOULD require the adversary to have access to the
          data as well as the signaling path for a successful attack to
          be launched.  An adversary that is located only along the data
          or the signaling path MUST NOT be able to successfully mount
          an attack.

   R17:   A solution SHOULD support the possibility to protect non-RTP-
          based data traffic.

   R18:   A solution MUST provide crypto-agility.

   R19:   A solution MUST protect cipher suite negotiation against
          downgrading attacks.

   R20:   A solution MUST allow a SIP User Agent to negotiate media
          security parameters for each individual session.

   R21:   A solution SHOULD allow establishing SRTP keying between
          different call signaling protocols (e.g., between Jabber, SIP,
          H.323, MGCP)

   R22:   A solution SHOULD support recording of decrypted media.

          Media recording may be realized by an intermediate nodes.  An
          example for those intermediate nodes are devices, which could
          be used in banking applications or for quality monitoring in
          call centers.  Here, it must be ensured, that the media
          security is ensured by the intermediate nodes on the
          connections to the involved endpoints as originally
          negotiated.  The endpoints need to be informed that there is
          an intermediate device and need to cooperate.  A solution
          approach for this is described in [I-D.wing-sipping-srtp-key].

   R23:   A solution SHOULD NOT allow end users to determine whether
          their end-to-end interaction is subject to lawful
          interception.

   R24:   A solution MUST work when there are intermediate nodes,
          terminating or processing media, between the end points.

                 [Note: this requirement needs more detail.]

   R25:   A solution MUST consider termination of media security in a
          PSTN gateway.

          A typical case of using media security is the one where two
          entities are having a VoIP conversation over IP capable
          networks.  However, there are cases where the other end of the



Wing, et al.            Expires November 23, 2007              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft         Media Security Requirements              May 2007


          communication is not connected to an IP capable network.  In
          this kind of setting, there needs to be some kind of gateway
          at the edge of the IP network which converts the VoIP
          conversation to format understood by the other network.  An
          example of such gateway is a PSTN gateway sitting at the edge
          of IP and PSTN networks.

          If media security (e.g., SRTP protection) is employed in this
          kind of gateway-setting, then media security and the related
          key management needs to be terminated at the gateway.  The
          other network (e.g., PSTN) may have its own measures to
          protect the communication, but this means that from media
          security point of view the media security is not employed end-
          to-end between the communicating entities.

          Therefore, media security solutions should cover the cases
          where media security is not employed end-to-end but is
          terminated in a gateway.

   R26:   If two parties share an authentication infrastructure that has
          3rd parties signing certificates, they MUST be able to use it,
          should the endpoints so desire.

                 [Note: in earlier versions of this document, this
                 requirement was part of R11.]

   R27:   If SRTP keying is performed over the media path, the keying
          packets MUST NOT pass the RTP validity check defined in
          Appendix A.1 of [RFC3550].


5.  Requirements Classification

   An adversary might be located along

   1.  the media path,

   2.  the signaling path,

   3.  the media and the signaling path.

   An attacker that can solely be located along the signaling path, and
   does not have access to media, is not considered (ref item 2).

   Furthermore, it is reasonable to consider the capabilities of the
   adversary.  We also have different types of adversaries, namely

Internet-Draft         Media Security Requirements              May 2007


   a.  active adversary

   b.  passive adversary

   Note that the adversary model for (a) and (b) also assumes the
   attacker being able to control SIP signaling entities.

   With respect to item (a) an adversary may need to be active with
   regard to the key exchange relevant information traveling along the
   data or the signaling path.

   Some of the deployment variants of the media security key management
   proposals under considerations do not provide protection against man-
   in-the-middle adversaries under certain conditions, for example when
   SIP signaling entities are compromised, when a global PKI is missing
   or pre-shared secrets are not exchanged between the end points prior
   to the protocol exchange.

   Based on the above-mentioned considerations the following
   classifications can be made:

   Class I:

      Passive attack on the signaling and the data path sufficient to
      reveal the content of the media traffic.


   Class II:

      Active attack on the signaling path and passive attack on the data
      path to reveal the content of the media traffic.


   Class III:

      Active attack on the signaling and the data path necessary to
      reveal the content of the media traffic.


   Class IV:

      Active attack is required and will be detected by the end points
      when adversary tampers with the messages.

   For example, SDES falls into Class I since the adversary needs to
   learn the SDES key by progressing a signaling message at a SIP proxy
   (assuming that the adversary is in control of the SIP proxy).
   Subsequent media traffic can be decrypted with the help of the

Internet-Draft         Media Security Requirements              May 2007


   learned key.

   As another example, DTLS-RTP falls into Class III when DTLS is used a
   public key based ciphersuite with self-signed certificates and
   without SIP Identity.  An adversary would have to modify the
   fingerprint that is sent along the signaling path and subsequently to
   modify the certificates carried in the DTLS handshake that travel
   along the media path.

   An attack is not successful when SIP Identity is used, the adversary
   is not between the SIP UA and its Authentication Service (or at the
   Authentication Service), both end points are able to verify the
   digital signature (of the SIP Identity) and are able to validate the
   corresponding certificates.

   priority is point-to-point unicast SRTP session keying, resolving
   shared-key SRTP session keying is deferred to later and left as an
   item for future investigations.
