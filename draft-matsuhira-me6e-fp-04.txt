1.  Introduction

   This document provides Multiple Ethernet - IPv6 address mapping
   encapsulation - fixed prefix (ME6E-FP) base specification.

   ME6E-FP make many virtual ethernet network over IPv6 network with
   unicast base technology.

   ME6E-FP can use on own routing domain, i.e. can advertise routes to
   the network.


2.  Basic Network Configuration

   Figure 1 shows network configuration with ME6E-FP.  The network
   consists of three parts.  IPv6 network, Nodes (Host or Router) , and
   ME6E-FP.

   Backbone network is operated with Dual Stack or IPv6 only.  Node may
   physical node or virtual node, and have Ethernet Interface.

   ME6E-FP connects IPv6 network and nodes.  ME6E-FP connect to node
   with Ethernet (Layer2), and ME6E-FP connect to IPv6 network with IPv6
   (Layer3).

3.  Basic Function of ME6E-FP

   ME6E-FP has mainly two function.  One is encapsulate from Ethernet
   frame to IPv6 packet, and decapsulate from IPv6 packet to Ethernet
   frame.  Another is advertise route corresponding to Ethernet MAC
   address.

3.1.  Ethernet over IPv6 Encapsulation

   ME6E-FP encapsulates ethernet frame to IPv6 packet from node to IPv6
   network, and decapsulates IPv6 packet to ethernet frame from IPv6
   network to node.  Figure 2 shows encapsulation and decapsulation of
   Ethernet frame and IPv6 packet

    \-------------------/             \-----------------------------/

                                 Figure 2

   The value of next header field of IPv6 header is TBD.  The value of
   EtherIP [RFC3378] may used, however new value for this protocol may
   assigned.

   When encapsulated IPv6 Packet size exceed path MTU , ME6E-FP fragment
   Ethernet frame, and then send them.

3.2.  Multiple Ethernet - IPv6 mapped address (ME6A) architecture

   ME6A[I-D.matsuhira-me6a] is a IPv6 address used in outer IPv6 header
   which encapsulate ethernet frame by ME6E-FP.

   Figure 3 shows ME6A architecture

   +-----------------------+--------------------------+----------------+

                                 Figure 3

   ME6 address consists of three parts as follows.

   ME6 address prefix

      ME6 address prefix .  This value is preconfigured to all ME6E-FP
      in the IPv6 networks.

   Multiple network plane ID

      Multiple network plane ID is an identifier of Ethernet network
      over IPv6 backbone network.  This value is preconfigured depend on
      the ME6E-FP belong which ethernet network plane.  This value is
      just like VLAN-ID of IEEE802.1Q, tag VLAN.

   Ethernet address

      Ethernet MAC address in inner Ethernet frame.  EUI-48 address or
      EUI-64 address.

   ME6 address is resolved by copying ethernet MAC address in inner
   ethernet frame, and preconfigured values, ME6 prefix and multiple
   network plane ID.

3.3.  Route Advertisement

   ME6E-FP advertises ME6 address host route to the IPv6 network.  The
   number of the route of ME6 addresses is the same as the number of MAC
   address table.

   In the IPv6 network, usual dynamic routing protocol for IPv6 can be
   used such as RIPng [RFC2080], OSPFv3 [RFC2740] and IS-IS [RFC5308] .


4.  ME6E-FP address format

   ME6E-FP can be used closely in the IPv6 network, so ME6 address does
   not be advertised outside of the IPv6 network, and IPv6 packet which
   contains ME6 address does not be forwarded outside of the backbone
   network.

   So, ME6 address format and ME6 address prefix can be decided each

   IPv6 network.  Some example are shown as follows.  These address is
   based on EUI-48 MAC address.  EUI-64 address is the future study.

4.1.  IPv6 Global Unicast Address

   This example is based on IPv6 Global Unicast Address Format
   [RFC3587].

   Figure 4 shows IPv6 Global Unicast Address Format.

   EUI-48 address

      EUI-48 MAC address of inner ethernet frame.

   IPv6 Global Unicast Address.

   EUI-48 address

      EUI-48 MAC address of inner ethernet frame

   32bits plane ID can represent about 4.3 billion ethernet network
   plane.

4.4.  mixture and renumbering of ME6 address

   If ME6 address prefix does not overlap, ME6 address can co-existing.
   And also, ME6 address prefix may renumber, that mean, small start
   with 16bits plane ID ME6 address, then renumber to 32bits plane ID
   ME6 address.

   ME6E-FP provide flexible operation for scalability of multiple
   network plane id.

5.  Configuration of ME6E-FP

   Configuration of ME6E-FP require just three information, ME6 address
   prefix, multiple Network plane ID, and prefix length of ME6E-FP
   route.  These information could explain just only one line, "<ME6E-FP
   address prefix><multiple network plane ID>/ prefix length of ME6E-FP
   route".


6.  Characteristic

   ME6E-FP has following useful characteristics.

   o  can operate unicast routing domain

   o  TBD


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA if using EtherIP Header.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


8.  Security Considerations

   ME6E-FP use automatic tunneling technologies.  Security consideration
   related tunneling technologies are discussed in RFC2893 [RFC2893],
   RFC2267 [RFC2267], etc.
