1  Introduction 

   Multicast Virtual Private Network (MVPN) is a service offered by 
   BGP/MPLS VPN service providers, that provides a way for IP multicast 
   traffic to travel from one customer site to another. [L3VPN-MCAST] is 
   the framework describing how various protocols fit together to enable 
   such functionality. 

   With the increased popularity, the scalability of deploying MVPN is 
   becoming of a great interest. There is, however, no standard method 
   defined to measure and compare different implementations. This 
   document proposes a MVPN scalability metric and methodology for 
   testing and comparing control plane MVPN scalability of (Provider 
   Edge) PE devices in a standardized way. 

   Before describing the detailed test methodology, it is important to 
   review the key factors that impact the scalability of MVPN 
   deployments:  

   o The MVPN Metric is 9-tuple comprised of a set of variables that 
     indicate the overall scalability capabilities of a PE device 
     implementation. MVPN scalability is multi-dimensional and can not 
     be quantified with single parameter, thus defining such a metric 
     set is necessary. MVPN Metric will be defined in section 5. The 
     remaining of this document focuses on a methodology that 
     characterizes different dimensions of MVPN Metric. 
   o Choice of MVPN architecture or MVPN design and operational choices 
     within specific architecture (such as selection of PIM protocol 
     variant or extent of S-PMSI (data MDT) usage), impact the overall 
     MVPN scalability of a PE device. Typically there is a tradeoff 
     between optimality and scalability. More details on these choices 
     with their tradeoffs are discussed in [MVPN-DEPLOY] and [L3VPN-
 
 
Dry, et al.              Expires May 9, 2008                   [Page 3]

     MCAST]. In this document design choices most suitable for a goal 
     of any given test case will be used which may not necessarily be 
     the same as recommended design choice for a realistic deployment. 
   o MVPN is a service that is never deployed in isolation as it 
     requires underlying unicast VPN offering. Typically SPs add MVPN 
     service on PE devices that are already deployed and are providing 
     a large number of other services such as unicast L3VPNs, L2VPNs, 
     internet access, etc. Therefore, when considering MVPN scalability 
     in realistic deployments one needs to take into consideration the 
     level to which PE resources are already utilized and the available 
     headroom amount remaining. In this document it will be assumed 
     that MVPN service is deployed as an addition of a "minimized" 
     unicast control plane. 
   o MVPN Scalability of a PE device is different when the system is 
     subjected to different stimuli. For example overall scalability 
     achieved in steady state is typically higher than when the system 
     is subjected to a network and/or device specific failures. In this 
     document a limited set of mandatory test stimuli will be defined. 
    
2  Document Scope 

   In IETF currently there are multiple proposals on architectures and 
   protocols for implementing MVPN service, as documented in [L3VPN-
   MCAST]. The scope of this document is to provide MVPN scalability 
   metric and benchmarking methodology set common to all architectures 
   from [L3VPN-MCAST].  However, some architectures may require 
   additional architecture specific test cases and considerations. This 
   document provides such additional test cases for the stable and 
   widely deployed MVPN architecture described in [L3VPN-MCAST] which 
   uses PIM protocol for both PE-PE transmission of C-Multicast routing 
   information (test cases in section 10) and to create 'tunnels' that 
   instantiate Multidirectional Inclusive P-Multicast Service Interfaces 
   (MI-PMSIs) and Selective P-Multicast Service Interfaces (S-PMSIs) 
   (test cases in section 11). The same architecture is also described 
   in [ROSEN-8] which is obsoleted by [L3VPN-MCAST]. In the rest of the 
   document this architecture will be referred to as "ROSEN-8" 
   architecture.  

   As other architectures from [L3VPN-MCAST] become stable and widely 
   deployed, amendments to this document can be made to address any 
   specific scalability considerations of such architectures.

   Scope of this document is to address comparison between different 
   implementations of the same MVPN architecture, and not between 
   different MVPN architectures defined in [L3VPN-MCAST]. 

   This document proposes a MVPN metric and a test methodology to 
   compare the MVPN control plane scalability of PE devices in a 
   standardized way. In contrast, forwarding performance benchmarking is 
   not within the scope of this document. 

   Test methodology defines a standard set of test cases, their test 
   execution procedures, results content and reporting format. Standard 
   test environment is also defined for each test case. 

   Test cases 9.1-9.7,10.1,11.1 focuses on determining implementation 
   limits individually for each of the key MVPN variables in a standard 
   way. Test cases (9.8-9.13) focus on determining implementation limits 
   for combination of all MVPN variables and will be helpful to 
   operators with network engineering for their deployments. Choices of 
   values of variables in test cases 9.8-9.13 were made using 
   information from the MVPN requirements survey conducted as part of 
   [MVPN-REQ]. 

   Each test case addresses following two major testing types: 

  . Steady State Testing: Device Under Test (DUT) and network as a 
     whole are not subject to any failure stimulus/control plane events.  
  . Failure Recovery Testing: DUT and or network components are subject 
     to different failure stimulus that introduces one or more control 
     plane instability events. 
   
   In this document limited set of mandatory test stimuli is also 
  defined. 

   Note that, depending on MVPN architecture, the deployment of MVPN 
   also consumes resources on network elements other than PE router such 
   as P devices, route reflectors and CE devices. Their scalability is 
   beyond the scope of this document. 

3  Terminology 

   DUT (Device Under Test) term will be used interchangeably with MVPN 
   PE device. All other PE devices in the test topology will be referred 
   to as "remote PEs".

   We will use term "MVPN architecture" to describe any specific subset 
   of protocols and procedures from [L3VPN-MCAST] that can enable MVPN 
   functionality on PE device. In contrast, we will use term "MVPN 
   implementations" to describe practical implementations of such "MVPN 
   architectures". 

   VPN related terms used in this document are defined in RFC4364 and 
   RFC2547bis. MVPN related terms used in this document are defined in 
   [L3VPN-MCAST].  

   PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast) related terms are defined in 
   RFC4601. 

   For the reader's convenience, here is review of some key terms used 
   in this document: 

   MVPN (Multicast Virtual Private Network): VPN that supports transport 
   of IP multicast traffic from one site to another. 

   PMSI (P-Multicast Service Interface): A PMSI is a conceptual 
   "overlay" on the P network with the following property: a PE in a 
   given MVPN can give a packet to the PMSI, and the packet will be 
   delivered to some or all of the other PEs in the MVPN, such that any 
   PE receiving such a packet will be able to tell which MVPN the 
   packet belongs to. 

   MI-PMSI (Multidirectional Inclusive PMSI): PMSI which enables ANY PE 
   attaching to a particular MVPN to transmit a message such that it 
   will be received by EVERY other PE attaching to that MVPN. 

   S-PMSI (Selective PMSI): PMSI which enables PE attaching to a MVPN to 
   transmit a message such that it will be received by subset of other 
   PEs attaching to that same MVPN. 

   Default MDT (Default Multicast Distribution Tree): Multicast 
   distribution tree through the SP core that connects ALL PEs which 
   belong to given MVPN. This is [ROSEN-8] terminology for transport 
   service of MI-PMSIs.  

   Data MDT (Data Multicast Distribution Tree): Multicast distribution 
   tree through the SP core that delivers VPN data traffic for a 
   particular multicast group only to those PE routers which are on the 
   path to receivers of that group. This is [ROSEN-8] terminology for 
   transport service of S-PMSIs.

Internet-Draft  Multicast VPN Scalability Benchmarking    November 2007 
    

    

   ASM (Any Source Multicast): Multicast service model in which a 
   receiver subscribes to a multicast group to receive traffic sent to 
   the group by any source. 

   SSM (Source Specific Multicast): Multicast service model in which a 
   receiver subscribes to a multicast group to receive traffic sent to 
   the group by the specific source. 

   Mroute: Multicast route. Term "state" will used interchangeable with 
   "mroute" and "multicast route". 

   "ROSEN-8" architecture: architecture described in [L3VPN-MCAST] which 
   uses PIM protocol for both PE-PE Transmission of C-Multicast Routing 
   and to create 'tunnels' that instantiate Multidirectional Inclusive 
   P-Multicast Service Interfaces (MI-PMSIs) and Selective P-Multicast 
   Service Interfaces (S-PMSIs). This is a same as architecture 
   described in [ROSEN-8]. 

   Ingress C-instance multicast group or mroute: C-instance multicast 
   group or mroute which has source behind VPN C-interface of DUT PE and 
   at least one receiver behind one of remote PEs. 

   Egress C-instance multicast group or mroute: C-instance multicast 
   group or mroute which has source behind one of remote PEs and at 
   least one receiver behind VPN C-interface of DUT PE. 

   Ingress traffic flow, packet, traffic: respectively multicast traffic 
   flow, packet, traffic forwarded by DUT using ingress C-instance 
   mroute. 

   Egress traffic flow, packet, traffic: respectively multicast traffic 
   flow, packet, traffic forwarded by DUT using egress C-instance 
   mroute. 

4  Key Words to Reflect Requirements 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.  

   RFC 2119 defines the use of these key words to help make the intent 
   of standards track documents as clear as possible.  While this 
   document uses these keywords, this document is not a standards track

5  MVPN Metric Definition 

   MVPN control plane scalability of PE device can not be described as a 
   single parameter but it requires a set of variables. We call such a 
   set "MVPN Metric" and define it further in this section. 

   When providing scalability capabilities of a PE device one MUST 
   provide values for all of the MVPN metric variables that were used 
   during the test. For example, one should never claim that a PE device 
   supports X number of MVPNs without disclosing the values of other 
   MVPN Metric variables. 

   The MVPN Metric is defined as a tuple of the following 9 variables: 

  1. Num_mVPN: Number of multicast VPN routing instances configured on 
     DUT that have MI-PMSI (default MDT) active and forwarding 
  2. Num_PE: Number of PE routers per multicast VPN 
  3. Num_MC_C_ints: Number of PIM C-interfaces on DUT 
  4. Num_PIM_C_neigh: Total number of PIM neighbors in PIM C-instances 
     across all mVPNs on DUT 
  5. Num_*G_C: Total number of (*,G) multicast routes across all MVPNs 
     on DUT capable of forwarding and created by PIM C-instances. 
  6. Num_SG_C: Total number of (S,G) multicast routes across all MVPNs 
     on DUT capable of forwarding and created by PIM C-instances. 
  7. Num_OIF_C: Total number of OIFs on DUT across all multicast routes 
     created by PIM C-instances. 
  8. Num_SPMSI_Src: Total number of S-PMSIs (data MDTs) across all mVPNs 
     on DUT that are sourced by DUT. 
  9. Num_SPMSI_Rx: Total number of S-PMSIs (data MDTs) across all mVPNs 
     on DUT for which DUT is a receiver. 
    
6  Test Environment 

   All protocols involved MUST be deployed with default timers as 
   specified by their corresponding RFC / standards. 

6.1 Test Topologies 

   Following test topology is used by all test cases that don't 
   explicitly specify different topology.

   Figure 1. Test Topology 1 

   Legend: 

   D1 (DUT's C-facing interface): DUT's interface that connects to 
   customer premise router (C-router). 

   D2 (DUT's P-facing interface): DUT's interface that connects to SP's 
   core router (P-router). 

   RR/P (Route Reflector/P-router) - single router that will be 
   performing roles of both P-router and route reflector 

   PE2 - Will also be referred to as "Remote PE" and is the router 
   performing PE functionality to assist with evaluation of DUT PE 
   router. 

6.2 Unicast Control Plane Setup 

   All P facing interfaces MUST use OSPF as IGP. This requirement is 
   made to provide a standard way to compare end to end convergence 
   times which depend on the underlying unicast protocol. Only a minimum 
   number of IGP routes required to establish connectivity should be 
   seen on the DUT. 

   All PE routers in the topology including the DUT and emulated PE's 
   MUST have one iBGP peer to the Route Reflector. DUT SHOULD NOT have 
   any additional iBGP peering. Only the minimum number of VPNv4 iBGP 
   routes required to establish site to site VPN connectivity should be 
   imported on the DUT.  There SHOULD NOT be any internet/ipv4 routes 
   seen on the DUT.

Internet-Draft  Multicast VPN Scalability Benchmarking    November 2007 
    

   A DUT MUST use static unicast routing on all C facing VPN interfaces. 
   Only the minimum number of static routes required to establish end to 
   end connectivity should be seen on the DUT. No dynamic unicast 
   routing protocol is used in order to minimize processing overhead. 

6.3 Multicast Control Plane Setup 

   In any given test, all MI-PMSIs (default MDTs) MUST be established 
   using the same protocol. In cases where PIM is used to establish MI-
   PMSIs, different tests may require different PIM protocol variants, 
   so refer to individual test cases for the appropriate PIM P-instance 
   configuration. In any test case where ASM (Any Source Multicast) mode 
   of PIM-SM (Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse mode) is the 
   multicast routing protocol used for MI-PMSI (default MDT), a DUT 
   SHOULD NOT be the RP (Rendezvous Point). Also dynamic RP discovery 
   protocols SHOULD NOT be used for default MDT groups.  

   For S-PMSIs (data MDT) point to multipoint trees MUST be used. For 
   example if PIM is used to build S-PMSI groups PIM-SSM (Source 
   Specific Multicast) routing protocol MUST be used. 

   Following C-instance multicast configuration MUST be used in all test 
   cases: 
            a. Protocol for PIM C-instances: PIM-SM (ASM) 
            b. RP Location for PIM C-instances: Test apparatus port 
               closest to the source. 
            c. SPT threshold for PIM C-instances: zero 
             
   Following per MVPN scale of common variables MUST be used in all test 
   cases except where test case setup explicitly asks to test with 
   different values: 

          a. Number of PIM VPN C-interfaces: 1 
          b. Number of sources per C-instance group: 2 
          c. Ratio of ingress to egress C-instance groups: 10%:90% 
           
   Behind each VPN C-interface there MUST be one receiver for each     
   C-instance group whose source doesn't reside behind the same        
   C-interface.  

   Sources emulated by test apparatus ports that are physically directly 
   connected to DUT (port A1 in Figures 1 and 2)  not have IP address 
   from DUT's connected subnets, i.e. the DUT MUST NOT be the first hop 
   router.

   For consistency, it is recommended for test apparatus ports that are 
   physically directly connected to DUT (port A1 in Figures 1 and 2)MUST 
   not to use IGMP protocol to emulate multicast receivers. Instead PIM 
   protocol should be used, i.e. the DUT should not be the last hop 
   router.  

   As an exception to previous paragraph it may exist specific network 
   design requirement to deploy IGMP receivers connected directly to the 
   DUT in which case test results MUST specify number of C-interfaces 
   with IGMP receivers. Regardless the IGMP protocol variant to be 
   deployed (IGMPV2 / V3); receivers MUST be emulated by the test 
   apparatus and NOT defined on the DUT in the form of static group 
   reports. Test apparatus MUST be capable to emulate an IGMP Host or 
   Querier and set a maximum Timer Interval between messages of 1/10th 
   of a second. 

6.4 Considerations for Number of Receivers behind remote PEs 

   Number of C-instance receivers behind remote PEs that MUST be 
   emulated with test tools for all ingress multicast groups depends on 
   protocol used for PE-PE signaling.  

   If PIM is used as PE-PE signaling and test case 10.2 revealed that PE 
   device does perform J/P suppression all test cases MUST be executed 
   with receiver behind only one of remote PEs for any given ingress C-
   instance group. This is required to properly emulate remote PEs that 
   support PIM J/P suppression with existing test tools which do not 
   support PIM J/P suppression.  

   If PIM is used as PE-PE signaling and test case 10.2 revealed that PE 
   device does not perform efficient J/P suppression, then for each test 
   case that is requesting in Test Setup section for Number of remote 
   PEs > 1, testing MUST be executed with receivers behind 50% of remote 
   PEs per ingress C-instance group. It is DESIRABLE to execute all such 
   test cases with 2 additional values of number receivers behind remote 
   PEs.  

   If BGP is used as PE-PE signaling, then for each test case that is 
   requesting in Test Setup section for Number of remote PEs > 1, 
   testing MUST be executed with receivers behind 50% of remote PEs per 
   ingress C-instance group. It is DESIRABLE to execute all such test 
   cases with 2 additional values of number receivers behind remote PEs. 

6.5 Data Traffic Characteristics 

   For every C-instance multicast route there MUST be traffic flow 
   associated with it and forwarded by DUT. 
 
 
Dry, et al.              Expires May 9, 2008                  [Page 11] 

Internet-Draft  Multicast VPN Scalability Benchmarking    November 2007 
    

   All C-instance flows SHOULD be transmitted with the same traffic rate 
   and packet size. 

   As the focus of this document is on the control plane scalability and 
   not on forwarding performance the data rate and packet size of 
   traffic flows can be chosen by user but it MUST be reported in the 
   test results. However it is suggested to use 10% of "idle system" 
   throughput [RFC1242] so that it can be easily detected if hardware 
   forwarding platforms start forwarding in software and at the same 
   time in case of software forwarding platforms there will be enough 
   processor headroom left for control plane scaling.  By "idle system" 
   we refer to system with all of MVPN metric variables minimized and 
   single VPN traffic flow in each direction.  

   As an additional requirement, the reader of this document may also be 
   interested in analyzing the "impact" that high traffic rate may have 
   on the control plane. This would be of interest mostly for software 
   forwarding platforms. For this specific requirement additional test 
   cases SHOULD be performed increasing the rate of multicast traffic to 
   20%, 50% and 90% of "idle system" throughput [RFC1242]. 

6.6 Test Apparatus Considerations 

   Different test tools must generate C-instance PIM protocol control 
   messages in a consistent way since they are directly connected to the 
   DUT. 

   The following MUST be implemented on all PIM sessions on the test 
   apparatus: 

     1) PIM Join/Prune aggregation MUST be utilized and set such that 80 
        PIM J/P messages are aggregated in each PDU  

     2) PIM Join/Prune aggregated PDUs MUST be sent at 10 PDUs/sec rate 
        per PIM session, i.e. this translates to maximum of 
        80*10*60=48,000 state per minute. 

     3) PIM Register messages MUST be sent at 100 PDUs/sec rate. 

7  Test Categories, Stimulus and Execution Methodology 

   Each test case specified in section 9 MUST be executed for steady 
   state and for each of six mandatory failure stimulus listed below. 
   Optionally one can use methodology defined in this document for 
   additional stimulus. 

   Mandatory failure stimulus: 
 
 
Dry, et al.              Expires May 9, 2008                  [Page 12] 

Internet-Draft  Multicast VPN Scalability Benchmarking    November 2007 
    

   1) DUT Power Cycle: Physical power cycle of DUT. All convergence 
     times MUST be measured from the time DUT's power is turned back 
     on. This time instance will be referred to as Tf (the time of 
     failure recovery action) for this failure stimulus. 

   2) Main Processor Card Switchover: Physical removal of the active 
     main processor card in the redundant system. All convergence times 
     should be measured from the time active processor card is 
     physically disconnected from the chassis (Tf). This stimulus can 
     be omitted only for platforms that do not support redundant main 
     processor cards. 

   3) P-facing Line Card OIR (online insertion and removal): Physical 
     removal and insertion of P-facing line card. Time between removal 
     and insertion SHOULD be at least 300 seconds. All convergence 
     times should be measured from the time line card is physically 
     inserted into chassis (Tf). 

   4) C-facing Line Card OIR: Physical removal and insertion of C-facing 
     line card. Time between removal and insertion SHOULD be at least 
     300 seconds. All convergence times should be measured from the 
     time line card is physically re-inserted into chassis (Tf). 

   5) P-facing Link Flap: Physical removal and insertion of the cable 
     from P router side that is connected to P-facing interface of DUT. 
     Time between removal and insertion SHOULD be at least 300 seconds. 
     All convergence times should be measured from the time cable is 
     physically re-inserted (Tf). 

   6) C-facing Link Flap: Physical removal and insertion of the cable 
     from test apparatus side that is connected to C-facing interface 
     of DUT. Time between removal and insertion SHOULD be at least 300 
     seconds. All convergence times should be measured from the time 
     cable is physically re-inserted (Tf). 

   Since the test execution methodology is similar for all test cases we 
   will describe it here for both steady state and failure recovery 
   testing. Any deviation from this will be specified per test case in 
   sections 9,10 and 11. 

   Multiple iterations of each test are required to determine maximum 
   value for certain set of variables. A single iteration will be 
   referred to as a "Test Case Instance".

7.1 Steady State Testing Execution Methodology 

   The following test execution procedure MUST be used for all Test Case 
   Instances during steady state testing of each test case defined in 
   sections 9,10 and 11 of this document: 

     1) Ensure the testbed is setup according to Test Setup instructions 
        of individual test case 

     2) All interfaces MUST be operational and MI-PMSIs (default MDTs) 
        required by the test case MUST be built as expected. 
        Verification can be done by DUT internal tools. 

     3) All real and emulated PE devices required by test cases MUST 
        have all C-instance PIM neighborships (including over MI-PMSIs) 
        operational in both directions. Verification MUST be done by 
        both external test apparatus and DUT internal tools. 

     4) All destination test apparatus ports configured to receive 
        multicast traffic should join all configured multicast groups.  

     5) All source test apparatus ports configured to transmit multicast 
        traffic should start transmitting to all multicast groups. 

     6) All multicast traffic MUST be received at all expected 
        destination test ports without any packet drops. This MUST be 
        verified using external test apparatus. If this state can not be 
        reached within 10 minutes of execution of step 5, continue to 
        next test case instance with reduced value of scaled variable/s 
        . 

     7) After state in previous step is reached wait 10 minutes and 
        start collecting data for this test instance required by 
        individual test case. This time instance is considered steady 
        state.  

     8) If any one of following conditions are reached continue to next 
        test case instance with reduced value of scaled variable/s: 

          o 100% utilization of system resources (memory, processor, 
             etc.) 

          o Failing of any of test case specific criteria or criteria in 
             steps 1-6 above 

     The number of Test Case Instances per test case is left to 
     tester's discretion. However, it is DESIRABLE to have results for 
 
 
Dry, et al.              Expires May 9, 2008                  [Page 14] 

Internet-Draft  Multicast VPN Scalability Benchmarking    November 2007 
    

     at least 5 test case instances. Having a range of values will help 
     in variable's characterization. The characterization of a variable 
     cannot be achieved with only one test case instance result. 

7.2 Failure Recovery Testing Execution Methodology 

   The following test execution procedure MUST be used for all Test Case 
   Instances during failure recovery testing of each test case defined 
   in section 9 of this document: 

     1) Execute steps 1-7 from section 7.1 

     2) After steady state in previous step is reached wait 10 minutes 
       to initiate one of mandatory failure stimulus listed in section 
       7. Note the time of failure recovery action (Tf) as displayed by 
       the external test apparatus that is measuring the received 
       multicast traffic.  

     3) Using the external test apparatus note the time when THE FIRST 
       multicast packet has been received on at least ONE of expected 
       ports. Refer to this time instance as Tre for the first such 
       ingress packet and Trd for the first such egress packet. 

     4) Using the external test apparatus note the time when ALL 
       multicast traffic has been received on ALL expected ports, i.e. 
       it has returned to the same initial rate (in pps). Refer to this 
       time instance Trall.  

     5) After state in previous step is reached execute steps 2-3 from 
       7.1.  

     6) If all data verified in step 5 is the same as before failure 
       wait 10 minutes and start collecting data for this test instance 
       required by each individual test case 

     7) If any one of following conditions are reached continue to next 
       test case instance with reduced value of scaled variable/s: 

          a. Value of MVPN metric in steady state reached after failure 
             stimuli (step 6 above) is not the same as in original 
             steady state. 

          b. Failing of any of test case specific criteria or criteria 
             in steps 1-6 above 

     The number of Test Case Instances per test case is left to 
     tester's discretion. However, it is DESIRABLE to have results for

     at least 5 test case instances. Having a range of values will help 
     in variable's characterization. The characterization of a variable 
     cannot be achieved with only one test case instance result. 

8  Results Content and Reporting Format

  16.    Any deviations in test execution procedure 
   
  It is DESIRABLE to include in the report items 1-16 above for all 
  optional test case instances executed, where instead of maximum value 
  achieved one would report tested value for each test case instance. 

   
8.2 Failure Recovery Testing 

   In addition to data included in steady state reports defined in the 
   previous section the following MUST be included in the result report 
   of each failure recovery test case: 

  1. The worst case end to end traffic convergence time (Trall-Tf) 
  2. The best case end to end traffic convergence time ((Tre-Tf) for 
     ingress traffic and (Trd-Tf) for egress traffic) 
   
  Note: Determination of whether all multicast flows had recovered to 
  the original traffic rate MUST be made by external test tools and  
  not by any available tools internal to the DUT or other routers in 
  the test topology. 
    

   It is DESIRABLE to include: 

  1. A graph from all test tool ports showing transmitted and received 
     packet rate starting from 60 seconds prior to failure action to 60

     interval from instance Tf to instance when the first C-instance PIM 
     neighbor across one of MI-PMSIs comes up on both DUT and 
     neighboring device (i.e. "bi-directional" neighborships are 
     established). 
  3. The worst case MI-PMSI PIM neighborship convergence time: time 
     interval from instance Tf to instance when all expected C-instance 
     PIM neighbors across one of MI-PMSIs comes up on both DUT and 
     neighboring device (i.e. "bi-directional" neighborships are 
     established).

9  Test Cases Common to all MVPN Architectures 

   Test cases in this section are applicable to all MVPN architectures 
   described in [L3VPN-MCAST]. As [L3VPN-MCAST] specifies use of S-PMSIs 
   as optional, test cases 9.5-9.7,9.11 can be omitted for implementers 
   that don't support S-PMSIs. For such implementers test cases 9.8-
   9.10,9.12-9.13 SHOULD still be executed but without use of S-PMSIs 
   and the exception MUST be documented in the test report.  

9.1 "Empty" MVPNs Scale 

   Test Objective: 

     To determine maximum number of MVPN instances that can be 
     configured and operational on the MVPN PE router. Note that we 
     refer here to mVPNs as "empty" as amount of PIM neighborships, 
     interfaces, C-instances multicast routes and SI-PMSIs associated 
     with given mVPN is negligible or zero in this test case. 

   Metric Variables Relationships: 

     Num_mVPN=Num_MC_C_ints 

     Num_*G_C=Num_SG_C=2*Num_mVPN 

     Num_OIF_C=4*Num_mVPN 

   Test Setup: 

     Following test setup MUST be performed prior to executing this test 
     case 

     1. Protocol for MI-PMSI P-instance PIM groups (if PIM used): ASM or 
       Bi-dir  
     2. S-PMSI (Data MDT) used: NO 
     3. Multicast Control Plane Profile (all per mVPN except a.; all 
       from DUT's perspective):

          b. Number of remote PEs: 1 
          c. Number of C-instance multicast groups : 2 
          d. Ratio of ingress vs. egress C-instance groups: 50%:50%

     Execute number of test case instances where in each test case 
     instance number of configured mVPNs is varied with the goal of 
     finding maximum number of mVPNs that can be configured and 
     operational on DUT. Configured mVPN will be considered operational 
     if all traffic flows are being received on ALL expected ports 
     without any drops. 

     For each test case instance perform steps 1-8 from section 7.1. and 
     1-7 from section 7.2 for all mandatory stimuli in section 7.  

   Test Result Report: 

     Data listed in 8.1 and 8.2 MUST be reported in tabular format for 
     at least maximum value of number of mVPNs achieved. It is DESIRABLE 
     to include the same data for at least 5 different values of number 
     of mVPNs (i.e. for at least 5 test case instances). 

9.2 PIM Enabled VPN C-Interfaces Scale 

   Test Objective: 

     To determine maximum number of PIM enabled VPN C-interfaces that 
     can be operational on the MVPN PE router for couple of fixed values 
     of number of mVPNs. Amount of all other MVPN Metric is minimized in 
     this test case. 

   Metric Variables Relationships: 

     Num_MC_C_ints >= Num_mVPN 

     Num_*G_C=Num_SG_C=Num_OIF_C=0 

   Test Setup: 

     Following test setup MUST be performed prior to executing this test 
     case 

     1. Protocol for MI-PMSI P-instance PIM groups (if PIM used): ASM or 
       Bi-dir 
     2. S-PMSI (Data MDT) used: NO 
     3. Multicast Control Plane Profile (all per mVPN except a.; all 
     from DUT's perspective): 
            a. Number of MVPNs configured on DUT (Num_mVPN): varies 
            b. Number of PIM VPN C-interfaces: varies 
            c. Number of remote PEs: 1

            d. Number of C-instance multicast groups : 0 
          
   Test Execution Procedure: 

   Following are steps to execute this test case: 

     1. Configure 100 mVPNs on DUT and PE2. Execute number of test case 
     instances where in each test case instance number of PIM enabled 
     VPN C-interfaces per mVPN is varied with the goal of finding 
     maximum number of PIM enabled VPN C-interfaces that can be 
     configured and operational on DUT. Configured VPN C-interface will 
     be considered operational if there is at least one PIM neighbor in 
     VPN C-instance on each configured C-interface. 

     2. Repeat step 1 for 100*I mVPNs where "i=2…N" where N is integer 
     value for which either maximum number of PIM enabled VPN C-
     interfaces per mVPN becomes smaller than one or maximum number of 
     mVPNs found in test case 9.1 is reached. 

     Note that in this test case there SHOULD NOT be any multicast C-
     instance traffic sources or receivers thus one MUST modify test 
     execution procedure from 7.1 and 7.2. For each test case instance 
     perform steps 1-3,7 from section 7.1. and 1-2,5-7 from section 7.2 
     for all mandatory stimuli in section 7.  

   Test Result Report: 

     Data listed in 8.1 and 8.2 MUST be reported in tabular format for 
     at least maximum achieved value of number of PIM enabled VPN C-
     interfaces. It is DESIRED to include the same data for at least 5 
     different values of PIM enabled VPN C-interfaces (i.e. for at least 
     5 test case instances). 

          
9.3 PIM C-instances Mroutes Scale 

   Test Objective: 

     To determine the maximum amount of PIM C-instance mroutes that a PE 
     router can create, maintain and forward on. Amount of most of other 
     MVPN Metric is minimized in this test case. 

   Metric Variables Relationships:  

     (Num_*G_C + Num_SG_C)>> Num_mVPN

     Num_OIF_C >> Num_mVPN 

     Num_MC_C_ints = Num_mVPN 

   Test Setup:

       Bi-dir  
 
     2. S-PMSI (Data MDT) used: NO  
     3. Multicast Control Plane Profile (all per mVPN except a.; all 
     from DUT's perspective): 
          a. Number of MVPNs (Num_mVPN) configured  on DUT: varies

          c. Ratio of ingress vs. egress C-instance groups: 100%:0%,

          d. Number of C-instance sources per group: 2 and 50 
          
   Test Execution Procedure: 

     Total number of C-instance PIM mroutes is proportional to product 
     of number of mVPNs DUT belongs to and average number of C-instance 
     PIM mroutes per mVPN. Total number of C-instance mroutes can vary 
     depending on number of mVPNs, number of sources per group and 
     location of the sources/receivers. Thus this test should be 
     executed for all specified values of parameters in Test Setup. 
      
     Each test will consist of finding maximum number of C-instance PIM 
     mroutes by varying average number of C-instance PIM mroutes per 
     mVPN for set of fixed values of number of mVPNs. Procedure is as 
     follows: 

     1. On DUT and PE2 configure 100 mVPNs. Setup environment such that 
       all PIM C-instance sources are behind DUT. Execute number of 
       test case instances using steps 1-7 in section 7.1 where in each 
       test case instance number of C-instance PIM groups is varied 
       until maximum number of C-instance PIM mroutes is found. 

     2. Repeat step 1 for 100*I mVPNs where "i=2…N" where N is integer 
     value for which either maximum number of C-instance PIM mroutes per

     mVPN becomes smaller than one or maximum number of mVPNs found in 
     test case 9.1 is reached. 

     3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for two more values of ingress vs. egress 
     C-instance groups ratio: 0%:100% and 10%:90%. 

     4. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for one more value of number of sources per 
     group 

     For each test case instance perform steps 1-8 from section 7.1. and 
     1-7 from section 7.2 for all mandatory stimuli in section 7.  

   Test Result Report: 

     Data listed in 8.1 and 8.2 MUST be reported in tabular format for 
     at least maximum value of average number of PIM C-instance mroutes

     include the same data for at least 5 different values of number of 
     PIM C-instance mroutes per mVPN for each of tested values of number

   Test Execution Procedure: 

     Test will consist of finding the maximum number of C-instance PIM 
     OIFs by varying the average number OIFs per PIM C-instance mroute. 
     Maximum number will be found for couple of values of number of C-
     instance PIM mroutes. Test will be executed for two values of 
     number of mVPNs: 100 and maximum value tested in 9.3.All C-instance 
     PIM mroutes will be in egress direction. Procedure is as follows: 

     1. For the first test iteration number of C-instance groups should 
       be set to 25% of maximum value achieved in test case instance of 
       9.3 where C-instance group ingress vs. egress ratio was 0:100% 
       and 100 mVPNs was used. Execute number of test case instances 
       using steps 1-8 in section 7.1 where in each test case instance 
       average number of C-instance OIFs per mroute is varied in 
       increments of 2 until maximum number of OIFs is reached. 

     2. Repeat step 1 for 50%,75% and 100% of egress C-instance groups 
       achieved in test case 9.3.

     OIFs for each of tested values of number of egress groups(i.e. for 
     at least 5 test case instances per each tested value of number of 
     egress groups).

     To determine the maximum number of S-PMSIs (data MDTs) that a PE 
     can join. In order to assess maximum number of S-PMSI (data MDTs) 
     joined, we minimize resources taken by C-instance mroutes by 
     requiring that no data MDT (S-PMSI) reuse is utilized in this test 
     case. Note that depending on specific deployment context data MDT 
     reuse might or might not be desirable.

   Test Execution Procedure: 

     Test will consist of varying number of S-PMSIs utilized by flows 
     that have receivers behind DUT (refer to those S-PMSI as "joined S-
     PMSIs"). During all test case instances total number of C-instance 
     PIM mroutes MUST remain constant and will be [Smax/4] rounded to 
     the first lower integer. We will vary total number of joined S-
     PMSIs by varying number of mVPNs configured to use S-PMSIs at the 
     remote PE that has sources behind it, while number of data S-PMSIs 
     per mVPNs will be same for all mVPNs that use them. If given mVPN 
     is using S-PMSIs in particular test case instance number of them 
     should be Dvpn=[Smax/(4*Vmax)] rounded to first lower value that 
     can be represented as 2^I where I is an integer. Note that number 
     of S-PMSIs configured and sourced by DUT MUST be zero in this test 
     case. Procedure is as follows: 

     1. Configure one mVPN on the remote PE and all flows so that this 
       mVPN has Dvpn S-PMSIs (data MDTs) utilized and all are sourced 
       at the remote PE and received at DUT. Execute steps 1-7 in 
       section 7.1  

     2. Repeat step 1 where number of mVPNs that utilize S-PMSIs/data 
       MDTs (in the exact same way as 1 mVPN described in step1) takes 
       following values 25%,50%,75%,and 100% of Vmax.  

     3. If platform limit is not reached during execution of step 2, 
       increase number of joined S-PMSIs (data MDTs) per mVPN and 
       repeat steps 1 and 2. 

     For each test case instance perform steps 1-8 from section 7.1. and 
     1-7 from section 7.2 for all mandatory stimuli in section 7.  

   Test Result Report: 

     Data listed in 8.1 and 8.2 MUST be reported in tabular format for 
     all test case instances executed. 

9.6 Sourced S-PMSI (Data MDT) Scale 

   Test Objective: 

     To determine maximum number of S-PMSIs (data MDTs) that PE can 
     source. In order to assess maximum number of S-PMSIs sourced, we 
     minimize resources taken by C-instance mroutes by requiring that no 
     S-PMSI (data MDT) reuse is utilized in this test case. Note that 
     depending on specific deployment context data MDT reuse might or 
     might not be desirable.

     Test will consist of varying number of C-instance flows that will 
     utilize S-PMSIs, while keeping number of C-instance mroutes and 
     data MDTs (S-PMSIs) constant. By doing this one can assess impact 
     of data MDT reuse.  

     Procedure is as follows: 

     1. Configure test apparatus such that number of flows using S-
        PMSIs is the same as number of S-PMSIs, i.e. there is no S-PMSI 
        reuse by multiple traffic flows. Execute steps 1-7 in section 
        7.1 and 1-8 in section 7.2 

     2. Repeat step 1 for 10*I flows where "i=2…N" where N is integer 
        value for which either maximum number of flows mapped to data 
        MDT (S-PMSI) is reached or number of flows becomes equal to 
        number of (S,G) C-instance mroutes.  

     For each test case instance perform steps 1-8 from section 7.1. and 
     1-7 from section 7.2 for all mandatory stimuli in section 7.  

   Test Result Report: 

     Data listed in 8.1 and 8.2 MUST be reported in tabular format for 
     all test case instances executed. 

9.8 Scale of mVPNs spanning large number of PEs 

   Test Objective: 

     As we noted mVPN scale is multidimensional and depends on number of 
     variables. While test cases 9.1-9.7 focused on only one or two 
     variables at the time while minimizing impact of all others, they 
     don't give good representation of platform capabilities in more 
     realistic deployment scenarios where none of variables are 
     minimized. Objective of this test case (and test cases 9.8-9.13)is 
     to assess capabilities of platform in more realistic deployment 
     scenario. In particular this test case will focus on finding 
     maximum number of mVPN instances that span large number of PE 
     routers while they have values for other MVPN variables chosen to 
     be on the order of magnitude used by MVPN deployments at the time 
     this draft was written. Specific values are defined in Test Setup 
     section.

          f. Number of data MDTs (S-PMSIs) with receivers behind DUT:8 
           
   Test Execution Procedure: 

     This test case SHOULD be repeated for all mechanisms of 
     instantiating MI-PMSIs (default MDTs) supported by implementer. If 
     PIM protocol is used all PIM variants(PIM ASM, SSM and Bi-dir) 
     supported by implementer should be tested. At minimum PIM ASM MUST 
     be tested. 

     Refer to 6.4 for guidelines on how many PE routers should be 
     sending J/P messages for any given ingress C-instance mroute. 

     Execute number of test case instances where in each test case 
     instance number of configured mVPNs is varied with the goal of 
     finding maximum number of mVPNs that platform can support. mVPN 
     instance here includes C-instance state, OIFs, PIM neighborships 
     and data MDTs (S-PMSIs) as specified by Test Setup. 

     For each test case instance perform steps 1-8 from section 7.1. and 
     1-7 from section 7.2 for all mandatory stimuli in section 7.

   Test Objective: 

     While test cases 9.12 and 9.13 assess two more extreme deployment 
     scenarios with respect to number of PE routers and mVPN routes,

   Test Result Report: 

     Data listed in 8.1 and 8.2 MUST be reported in tabular format for 
     at least maximum value of number of mVPNs achieved. It is DESIRED 
     to include the same data for at least 5 different values of number 
     of mVPNs (i.e. for at least 5 test case instances). 

9.11 S-PMSI Switching Delay 

   Test Objective:  
 
   The test objective is to measure the elapsed time for traffic to 
   start flowing on S-PMSI, i.e.,  the time from the moment of signaling 
   of an S-PMSI to the moment when traffic starts flowing on the S-PMSI. 
   We will refer to this measure as S-PMSI switching delay [S-
   PMSI_DELAY].  

   Metric Variables Relationships: 

     Same as for test case 9.10.   
 
   Test Setup:  
 
     Same as for test case 9.10.   
   
   Test Execution Procedure:  
 
     Test will measure the time for traffic to start flowing on S-PMSI, 
     i.e., the time from the moment of signaling of an S-PMSI to the 
     moment when traffic starts flowing on the S-PMSI on the DUT. This 
     test MUST be repeated multiple (at least 20) times (for each value 
     of number of mVPNs) across multi-second intervals in order to 
     isolate any timing issues. This test MUST be performed with 
     varying number of average size MVPNs on DUT (up to the maximum) as 
     defined in the test case 9.10. With a given number of MVPNs on 
     DUT, the switching delay of several S-PMSIs sourced at the DUT in 
     different MVPNs will be measured. In case S-PSMI creation is 
     triggered by rate of C-instance traffic flow, the S-PMSI threshold 
     should be set to min possible value, depending on the 
     implementation. Such threshold value used MUST be documented in 
     the test report.

   Test Result Report:  
 
     The test results MUST include the range of S-PMSI switching 
     delays: minimum, average and maximum [S-PMSI_DELAY].  
     Data listed in 8.1 and 8.2 MUST be reported in tabular format for 
     at least maximum value of number of mVPNs achieved. It is DESIRED 
     to include the same data for at least 5 different values of number 
     of mVPNs (i.e. for at least 5 test case instances). 

 
9.12 Convergence of C-Instance PIM Joins 

   Test Objective:  
 
    The test objective is to measure how long it takes for the first  
    receiver on the DUT, issuing C-instance PIM (*,G) Join, to receive 
    the traffic from already active C-instance source (S,G).  
 
   Metric Variables Relationships: 

     Same as for test case 9.14. 
 
   Test Setup:  
 
     Same as in test case 9.14 
           
   Test Execution Procedure:  
 
     Test will consist of an active C-instance source (S,G) attached 
     to/behind a remote PE (PE2 in Topology #1). There will be at least 
     one active C-instance receiver of (*,G) behind this remote PE 
     (PE2). This setup ensures that C-instance PIM Register procedure 
     for (S,G) has been completed and that there are no receivers 
     across the core network.  With this initial setup, the test will 
     add one C-instance (*,G) receiver attached to DUT and issuing PIM 
     (*,G) Join towards the DUT. The test will measure the time 
     for traffic from (S,G) behind the remote PE to be received by 
     (*,G) receiver behind the DUT. This test MUST be repeated multiple 
     (at least 10) times in order to isolate any timing issues. This 
     test MUST be performed with varying number of average size MVPNs 
     (up to the maximum) as defined in the test case 9.14.

   Test Result Report:  
 
    The test results MUST include the range of C-instance PIM (*,G) 
    Join convergence times: minimum, average, maximum.  
    Data listed in 8.1 and 8.2 MUST be reported in tabular format for at 
    least maximum value of number of mVPNs achieved. It is DESIRED to 
    include the same data for at least 5 different values of number of

9.13 Effect of Co-locating C-RPs on a PE  

   Test Objective: 

     The test objective is to assess scaling impact of SP hosting  
     customer's RPs (C-RPs) on  PE router. This is the optional 
     deployment model as stated in [MVPN-REQ] and is deployed today by 
     number of service providers. Only difference between test cases 
     9.10 and 9.13 is location of C-RP; thus by comparing test results 
     of 9.10 and 9.13 one will be able to determine additional impact 
     co-locating RP has on PE scale compared to deployment model of 
     customers hosting their own RPs. 

   Metric Variables Relationships:  

      Same as in 9.10.  

   Test Setup: 

      Same as in 9.10, except for placing C-instance RPs on DUT. 
   Test Execution Procedure: 

     This test case SHOULD be repeated for all mechanisms of 
     instantiating MI-PMSIs (default MDTs) supported by implementer. If 
     PIM protocol is used all PIM variants(PIM ASM, SSM and Bi-dir) 
     supported by implementer should be tested. At minimum PIM ASM MUST 
     be tested. 

     Refer to 6.4 for guidelines on how many PE routers should be 
     sending J/P messages for any given ingress C-instance mroute. 

     Execute number of test case instances where in each test case 
     instance number of configured mVPNs is varied with the goal of 
     finding maximum number of mVPNs that platform can support in this 
     environment. mVPN instance here includes C-instance state, OIFs,

     PIM neighborships and data MDTs (S-PMSIs) as specified by Test 
     Setup.  

     For each test case instance perform following steps: 

          a. Steps 1-4 from section 7.1. 

          b. Send PIM Register messages from all "source" test apparatus 
            ports  

          c. Test apparatus should verify that correct (S,G) PIM Join 
            messages had been received by "source" test apparatus port. 
            In reaction to receipt of (S,G) joins, source test 
            apparatus ports should start transmitting multicast traffic 
            to appropriate multicast groups and start sending Data-
            header Registers [RFC4601]. 

          d. Steps 6-8 from section 7.1.  

     For all mandatory stimuli defined in section 7 perform following 
     steps:  

       a.  Steps a-d from paragraph above 

       b.  Steps 2-7 from section 7.2 

   Test Result Report: 

     Data listed in 8.1 and 8.2 MUST be reported in tabular format for 
     at least maximum value of number of mVPNs achieved. It is DESIRED 
     to include the same data for at least 5 different values of number 
     of mVPNs (i.e. for at least 5 test case instances). 

10 Test Cases Specific to PIM PE-PE signaling 

   Test cases in this section are applicable only to MVPN architectures 
   which use PIM protocol for PE-PE transmission of C-Multicast routing 
   information, such as "ROSEN-8" architecture. 

10.1 PIM Neighborships Scale 

   Test Objective: 

     To determine maximum number of PIM C-instance neighborships across 
     MI-PMSIs that PE router can create and maintain. Amount of most of 
     other MVPN Metric such as C-instance multicast routes is minimized 
     in this test case.

   Metric Variables Relationships: 

     Num_MC_C_ints = Num_PIM_C_neigh = Num_mVPN 

     Num_*G_C = Num_SG_C = 2*Num_mVPN 

     Num_OIF_C = 4*Num_mVPN 

   Test Setup: 

     Following test setup MUST be performed prior to executing this test 
     case 

     1. Protocol for MI-PMSI P-instance PIM groups (if PIM used): ASM or 
       Bi-dir  
     2. S-PMSI (Data MDT) used: NO 
     4. Multicast Control Plane Profile (all per mVPN except a.; all 
     from DUT's perspective): 
          a. Number of MVPNs configured on DUT (Num_mVPN): varies 
          b. Number of remote PEs: varies 
          c. Number of C-instance multicast groups : 2 
          d. Ratio of ingress vs. egress C-instance groups: 50%:50% 
          
   Test Execution Procedure: 

     Number of C-instance PIM neigborships across MI-PMSIs is 
     proportional to product of number of mVPNs DUT belongs to and 
     average number of PEs belonging to the same mVPNs. 
      
     Test will consist of finding maximum number of C-instance PIM 
     neighborships across MI-PMSIs by varying average number of PEs per 
     mVPN for set of fixed values of number of mVPNs. Procedure is as 
     follows: 

      1. Configure 100 mVPNs on DUT. Execute number of test case 
        instances where in each test case instance number of PE routers 
        belonging to each mVPN is varied until maximum number of such 
        PEs is found. All mVPNs should have same number of PE routers. 

      2. Repeat step 1 for 100*I mVPNs where "i=2…N" where N is integer   
      value for which either maximum number of PEs per mVPN becomes 
      smaller than one or maximum number of mVPNs found in test case 9.1 
      is reached.

     For each test case instance perform steps 1-8 from section 7.1. and 
     1-7 from section 7.2 for all mandatory stimuli in section 7.  

   Test Result Report: 

     Data listed in 8.1 and 8.2 MUST be reported in tabular format for 
     at least maximum value of average number of PEs for every tested 
     value of number of mVPNs per PE (Num_mVPN). It is DESIRED to 
     include the same data for at least 5 different values of number of 
     PEs for each of tested values of number of mVPNs per PE(i.e. for at 
     least 5 test case instances per each tested value of number of 
     mVPNs). 

10.2 PIM C-instances J/P Suppression Effectiveness 

   Test Objective: 

   If PIM is used as PE-PE signaling, optional feature of PIM J/P 
   Suppression is performed by all PE devices that have receivers behind 
   them (refer to such PE as egress PE). Goal of this test case is to 
   assess capability of egress PE to perform C-instance J/P suppression 
   for large amount of C-instance multicast routes. 

   Metric Variables Relationships:

            3) Start all traffic from "Src" (test apparatus port R1 in 
               topology diagram) and wait until steady state is 
               achieved. 

            4) On C-instance PIM session used for PE-PE signaling of 
               test apparatus port "Src" (B2) measure number of C-
               instance J/Ps received in 10 minute (J1) interval and 
               calculate rate of J/Ps as JR1=J1/(60*10). 

             

            5) Perform all C-instance PIM joins from test apparatus port 
               "Rx1" (R1) and wait until steady state is achieved on 
               DUT. 

            6) On C-instance PIM session used for PE-PE signaling of 
               test apparatus port "Src" (B2) measure number of C-
               instance J/Ps received in 10 minute (J2) interval and 
               calculate rate of J/Ps as JR2=J2/(60*10). 

            7) If JR2 < 1.2*JR1 we can conclude that DUT is suppressing 
               J/P messages successfully. 

   Repeat steps 1-7, for maximum number of C-instances multicast routes 
   obtained in test case 9.3 for maximum number of mVPN  and 100% state 
   in egress direction. 

   Note that no failure recovery testing is required in this test case. 

   Test Result Report: 

     Data listed in 8.1 MUST be reported in tabular format for all test 
     case instances. In addition rates JR1 and JR2 MUST be reported. 
     Optionally one can report absolute numbers or rates of number of 
     PIM J/P PDUs transmitted by DUT and PE3 (test apparatus port B5). 

      

11 Test Cases Specific to PIM MI-PMSI trees 

   Test cases in this section are applicable only to MVPN architectures 
   which use PIM protocol to create 'tunnels' that instantiate MI-PMSIs 
   and optional S-PMSIs, such as "ROSEN-8" architecture.

     To determine maximum number of mVPNs and PE routers per mVPN when 
     PIM P-instance  is using protocol variant that generates maximum 
     amount of PIM P-instance mroutes. Amount of most of other MVPN 
     Metric such C-instance multicast mroutes is minimized in this test 
     case. 

   Metric Variables Relationships: 

     Num_MC_C_ints = Num_mVPN 

     Num_*G_C = Num_SG_C = 2*Num_mVPN 

     Num_OIF_C = 4*Num_mVPN 

   Test Setup: 

     Following test setup MUST be performed prior to executing this test 
     case 

     1. Protocol for MI-PMSI P-instance PIM groups: SSM  
     2. S-PMSI (Data MDT) used: NO 
     3. Multicast Control Plane Profile (all per mVPN except a.; all 
     from DUT's perspective): 
          a. Number of MVPNs configured on DUT (Num_mVPN): varies 
          b. Number of remote PEs: varies 
          c. Number of C-instance multicast groups : 2 
          d. Ratio of ingress vs. egress C-instance groups: 50%:50 
 
   Test Execution Procedure: 

     Amount of PIM P-instance mroutes on PE router created by default 
     MDTs (MI-PMSIs) depends in general on choice of PIM protocol 
     variant, number of mVPNs and average number of PE routers per mVPN. 
     In order to assess the impact of PIM P-instance mroutes created by 
     MVPN default MDTs (MI-PMSIs) has on resources, test case 10.1 will 
     be repeated with changing PIM P-instance protocol mode to SSM. Note 
     that test cases 9.1-9.7 and 10.1-2 use Bi-dir PIM or PIM-SM (ASM) 
     with SPT threshold of infinity in order to minimize impact PIM P-
     instance mroutes has on resources while focusing on characterizing 
     other variables described in test cases 9.1-9.7 and 10.1-2.
