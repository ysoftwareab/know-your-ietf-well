Internet-Draft                RSerPool MIB                   August 2006


Abstract

   RSerPool [2] is a framework to provide reliable server pooling.  This
   document defines a SMIv2 compliant Management Information Base (MIB)
   providing access to managed objects in an RSerPool implementation.

1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module which
   describes managed objects for RserPool implementations.

2.  The Reliable Server Pooling (RSerPool) Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Reliable Server Pooling (RSerPool) framework, please refer to [1],
   [2], [3], [4], [5] and [6].  A more informal introduction can be
   found at [14].

3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [12].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [9], STD 58, RFC 2579 [10] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [11].

   As the figure shows, the MIB consists of three main branches:
   "enrpServers", "poolElements" and "poolUsers".  The first branch,
   "enrpServers" is used to access managed objects in the set of ENRP
   servers running on a given host.  While it is assumed that it does
   not make much sense to run multiple ENRP servers for the same
   operation scope on one host, running multiple ENRP servers for
   different operation scopes is very likely when the ENRP server
   processes run on routers.  Therefore, the MIB has to be able to
   manage multiple ENRP servers on the same host. "poolElements" is used
   to access managed objects in the set of Pool Elements that are
   running on a given host and the third branch, "poolUsers" is used to
   access managed objects in the set of Pool Users that are running on a
   given host.  In fact, the structure of the three branches is very
   similar.  Because the two branches are so similar, we describe only
   the first branch in detail, and provide a summary description of the
   second and third branch.  We now proceed with a description of the
   branches.

4.1.  Access to managed objects on ENRP servers

   The first branch describes managed objects at a set of ENRP servers.
   Any given ENRP server of this set will, at a certain moment in time,
   have registration information for a set of active pools.  Each of
   these pools in turn may have a list of pool elements that are
   registered under that pool.  To allow this information to be

   retrieved via SNMP, the ERNP server branch of the RSerPool MIB uses
   the table-in-table technique described in [13].  Specifically, the
   ENRP servers branch creates four levels of nesting, as indicated in
   the following diagram:

   Nesting of ENRP Server Branch


   Nesting Structure:

    Level 1: enrpServerTable

    Level 2:    enrpServerPoolTable
    Level 3:       enrpServerPoolElementTable
    Level 4:          enrpServerASAPAddrListTable
                      enrpServerUserAddrListTable

    Level 2:    enrpServerENRPAddrListTable

    Level 2:    enrpServerPeerTable
    Level 3:       enrpServerPeerAddrListTable


   The ENRP servers branch contains a table of the host's ENRP server
   instances.  Its purpose is to provide an index to an ENRP server for
   all other tables.  Each "conceptual row" in the enrpServerTable
   contains the server's ENRP Identifier, the number of pools, PEs and
   peers, the amount of ENRP endpoint addresses, the server's uptime and
   a textual description of the server.  The poolTable contains a single
   entry for each pool that is currently registered.  Each "conceptual
   row" in the enrpServerPoolTable consists of a
   enrpServerPoolTableEntry, with two elements: a enrpServerPoolIndex
   and an OCTET STRING representation of the pool handle.  The
   enrpServerPoolIndex is simply an integer that is used to index into
   the enrpServerPoolTable and the enrpServerPoolElementTable.  The
   value of this integer is between zero and (poolCount - 1).  Note that
   the value of enrpServerPoolIndex is defined as "not-accessible" in
   the MAX-ACCESS clause; this is a standard technique used when
   defining a table-in-table data structure.  The third element on the
   ENRP servers branch is the enrpServerPoolElementTable.  Because the
   enrpServerPoolElementTable is the "inner" table of the table-in-table
   structure, its index consists of a pair, as indicated in the clause
   "INDEX { enrpServerIndex, enrpServerPoolIndex,
   enrpServerPoolElementIndex }".  The fourth element of the ENRP
   servers branch takes the nesting to one additional level, listing the
   various addresses associated with a particular enrpServerPoolElement
   in form of ASAP endpoint addresses and user transport addresses, and
   thus are indexed by the 4-tuples "INDEX { enrpServerIndex,

   enrpServerPoolIndex, enrpServerPoolElementIndex,
   enrpServerASAPAddrListTableIndex }" and "INDEX { enrpServerIndex,
   enrpServerPoolIndex, enrpServerPoolElementIndex,
   enrpServerUserAddrListTableIndex }".  The ENRP endpoint addresses of
   an ENRP server are bound to its instance in the
   enrpServerENRPAddrListTable by "INDEX { enrpServerIndex,
   enrpServerENRPAddrListTableIndex }".  Finally, an ENRP server has a
   peer table of its known peers.  They are bound to a server instance
   by the enrpServerPeerTable; analogously, the addresses of a peer are
   bound to a peerTable's entry in the peerAddrListTable.

4.2.  Access to managed objects on Pool Elements

   The construction of the Pool Elements branch is very similar to the
   pool elements table of the ENRP servers branch.  But instead of
   grouping the pool elements into pools (which does not make sense
   here), the pool elements table is the top of the hierarchy and each
   pool element entry specifies its operation scope and pool handle.
   That is, the nesting structure is as follows:

    Level 1:    poolElementTable
    Level 2:       poolElementASAPAddrListTable
                   poolElementUserAddrListTable

   The description of the contained structures is the same as for the
   ENRP servers branch.

   TODO: There should be the server table (ENRP servers learned by their
   announces) plus the multicast address the PE expects the announces to
   be sent to.

4.3.  Access to managed objects on Pool Users

   For the pool users branch, it is only necessary to list the pool
   users, including their operation scope and pool handle.

   TODO: There should be the server table (ENRP servers learned by their
   announces) plus the multicast address the PE expects the announces to
   be sent to.

6.  Security Considerations

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), there is no control as
   to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET/SET (read/
   change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [7] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [8] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/
   create/delete) them.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA will need to assign an OID prefix for the RSerPool MIB.
