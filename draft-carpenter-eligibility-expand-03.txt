        Additional Criteria for Nominating Committee Eligibility
                 draft-carpenter-eligibility-expand-03

Abstract

   This document defines a process experiment under RFC 3933 that
   temporarily updates the criteria for qualifying volunteers to
   participate in the IETF Nominating Committee.  It therefore also
   updates the criteria for qualifying signatories to a community recall
   petition.  The purpose is to make the criteria more flexible in view
   of increasing remote participation in the IETF and a probable decline
   in face-to-face meetings.  This document temporarily varies the rules
   in RFC 8713.

1.  Introduction

   According to [RFC8713], the IETF Nominating Committee is populated
   from a pool of volunteers with a specified record of attendance at
   IETF plenary face-to-face meetings.  In view of the unexpected
   cancellation of the IETF 107 meeting, the risk of future
   cancellations, the probability of less frequent meetings in future in
   support of sustainability, and a general increase in remote
   participation, this document defines a process experiment [RFC3933]
   of fixed duration to use additional criteria to qualify volunteers.

   Also according to [RFC8713], the qualification for signing a
   community petition for the recall of certain IETF office-holders is
   that same as for the Nominating Committee.  This document does not
   change that, but see Section 7.

   The source for this is at https://github.com/sftcd/elig/ and PRs are
   welcome there.  Discussion on the eligibility-discuss@ietf.org list
   is also welcome.

Internet-Draft       Additional Eligibility Criteria           July 2020


2.  Term of the Experiment

   The cancellation of the in-person IETF 107 meeting, and the risk of
   IETF 108 also being cancelled, mean that the current criteria are in
   any case seriously perturbed for the next two years.  The experiment
   therefore needs to start as soon as possible.  However, the
   experiment does not apply to the selection of the 2020-2021
   Nominating Committee.

   The experiment will cover the two IETF Nominating Committee cycles
   starting in 2021 and 2022.  As soon as the 2022-2023 Nominating
   Committee is seated, the IESG must consult the Nominating Committee
   chairs involved and publish a report on the results of the
   experiment.  The IESG must then also begin a community discussion of
   whether to amend [RFC8713] in time for the 2023 Nominating Committee
   cycle.

3.  Goals

   The goals of the additional criteria are as follows:

   *  Mitigate the issue of active remote (or rarely in-person)
      participants being disenfranchised in the NomCom and recall
      processes.

   *  Prepare for an era in which face-to-face plenary meetings are less
      frequent (thus extending the issue to many, perhaps a majority, of
      participants).

   *  Ensure that those eligible are true "participants" with enough
      current understanding of IETF practice and people to make informed
      decisions.

   *  The criteria must be algorithmic so that the Secretariat can check
      them mechanically.

4.  Criteria

   There will be several alternative paths to qualification, replacing
   the single criterion in section 4.14 of [RFC8713].  Any one of the
   paths is sufficient, unless the person is otherwise disqualified
   under section 4.15 of [RFC8713]:

   *  Path 1: As per [RFC8713], the person has attended 3 out of the
      last 5 in-person IETF meetings.

      -  This criterion has been retained for backward compatibility.
         It has not been extended to include remote participation in
         meetings, since the additional criteria below are intended to
         capture significant participation without regard to meeting
         attendance.

   *  Path 2: Has been a WG Chair or Secretary, or a BOF Chair, within
      the last 3 years.

   *  Path 3: (Feedback on path 3 from draft-01 was uniformly negative
      so ignore this, we'll leave placeholder text here for now just to
      avoid renumbering.)

   *  Path 4: Has served in the IESG or IAB, or has been appointed to a
      formal role by the IESG or IAB, within the last 5 years.

   *  Path 5: Has been a listed author of at least 2 IETF stream RFCs
      and/or WG-adopted drafts within the last 5 years.

5.  Open Questions

   *  Should we consider how many nomcom voting members qualify via
      which paths?  For example, would it be ok if all 10 nomcom voting
      members qualified via path 4 in one year?

   *  Certain criteria were rejected as not truly indicating effective
      IETF participation.  These included authorship of individual
      Internet-Drafts, sending email to IETF lists, reviewing drafts,
      etc.  Since the criteria must be objectively and mechanically
      measurable, no qualitative evaluation of an individual's
      contributions is considered.

6.  Available data

   An analysis of how some of the above criteria would affect the number
   of NomCom-qualified participants if applied in June 2020 has been
   performed.  The results are presented below in Venn diagrams as
   Figure 1 to Figure 4.  Note that the numbers shown may differ
   slightly from manual counts due to database mismatches.

                          Figure 4: 2018 - 3 years

7.  Possible Future Work

   *  Combined paths (e.g., a person who partly satisfies Path 2 and
      Path 5); otherwise known as a "points system".  That seems to
      involve work/complexity either for the secretariat or for the
      volunteer.

   *  Tweaking the "time decay" in each of the path definitions that
      ensures recent participation is more highly valued.

   *  Separating the NomCom volunteer criteria from the recall
      petitioner criteria.
