1. Abstract

   Work has been progressing in the Multi-protocol Label Switching
   (MPLS) working group on the application of MPLS technology to non-
   packet switching networks.  Specifically, development of the
   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) signaling draft [1] has allowed for
   Optical, SONET/SDH, and spatial switching to be controlled by IP
   protocols.

   It is desirable to be able to separate the control mechanisms for
   these forms of switching from the actual switch matrix.  This allows
   for independent upgrade of control planes as well as switching
   planes.  Further, it allows GMPLS to be implemented on already
   deployed switches that may be limited, by CPU or memory, in their
   ability to implement the control plane.

   The GSMP protocol [2] has been defined to handle communications
   between a controller and the label-based packet or cell switch under
   control.  This draft discusses extensions to the GSMP label formats
   for Optical, SONET/SDH, TDM, and spatial switching.  Where possible,
   the GMPLS label formats and methods are reused.

3. GSMP Label formats

   The GSMP protocol specification defines one flexible format for GSMP
   labels -- the TLV label.  The nominal format for TLV labels is as
   follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |T|S|x|x|       Label Type      |          Label Length         |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                                                               |
      ~                          Label Value                          ~
      |                                                               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The fields are defined as follows:

          T: Label Type Indicator
               T = 0: Short 28 bit Label (deprecated)
               T = 1: TLV label

          S: Stacked Label Indicator

          x: Reserved Flags. These are generally used by specific GSMP
               messages.

   For all GSMP labels, the Label value in the Label field must be
   interpreted according to the Label Type attribute of the switch port
   being referenced by the overall GSMP message.

4. GMPLS label formats
   The GMPLS specification includes definition of a number of unique
   label formats for technologies including SONET/SDH, Async TDM,
   Lambda, and Spatial (fiber) switching.  However, probably more
   important to GSMP, the GMPLS specification also defines specific
   procedures on how to use these labels.

4.1 Label Hierarchy

   GMPLS identifies that the multiplexing hierarchy that exists in
   transport networks (Fiber in a Bundle, Lambda on a Fiber, STS/STM on
   a Lambda, etc.) can be modeled as a set of nested tunnels, with the
   larger container consisting of a number of lower order containers.
   As such:

Sadler                    GSMP WG - May 2001                         2
             draft-sadler-gsmp-tdm-labels-00.txt     November 2000


   o a specific fiber in a bundle will have a label to identify it
   o a specific lambda on the fiber will have another label
   o the STS within the lambda will have a third label identifying it.

   Since the nested lower order containers inherit the context of the
   higher order container that they are sub-ordinate to, it is possible
   to use the MPLS label stack to reference the subordinate signal.

   The GSMP labels defined within this document further use this method
   of referencing a signal within a multiplex structure.

4.2 Label lists

   The GMPLS draft further discusses a procedure for naming the
   component signals in a multiplex that are part of an arbitrary
   concatenation group.  Unlike the bit-field format proposed in GSMP,
   GMPLS uses a list of labels to encode the concatenation group
   members.  While this potentially lengthens the message based on the
   number of members, it does not change the general semantics for a
   label.  This approach is preferable as a number of existing MPLS
   label management implementations have assumed the ability to use
   ordinal math in the label space.

   The following TLV label format implements Label Lists in GSMP:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |T|S|x|x|Label List TLV (0xNNN) |          Label Length         |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                      Res                              |  RGT  |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      ~T|0|x|x|                 Inner TLV Label                       ~
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      ~                               ...                             ~
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      ~T|0|x|x|                 Inner TLV Label                       ~
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-|

   The fields are defined as follows:

          RGT: Requested Grouping Type.  This contains the type of
               concatenation to be used and is identical to the field
               by the same name in the GMPLS Generalized Label Request.

   There MUST be 1 or more inner labels in the Label List TLV.  The S
   bit for the Inner TLV Label has no meaning, as concatenated signals
   can only be made up of signals within the same sub-multiplex.
   Therefore, the S bit MUST always be 0.

5. TDM labels

   Within the TDM technology space, two major sets of standards exist:
   o Synchronous technologies (SDH and SONET)
   o Plesiochronous technologies (i.e. ETSI E1/E3, ANSI DS1/DS3)

   The following sections discuss the label formats for use with both
   technologies.

5.1 SDH and SONET labels

   SDH and SONET each define a multiplexing structure. These two
   structures are trees whose roots are respectively an STM-N or an
   STS-N; and whose leaves are the signals (time-slots) that can be
   transported and switched, i.e. a VC-x or a VT-x. A label will
   identify the type of a particular signal and its exact position in a
   multiplexing structure (both are related).

   These multiplexing structures will be used as naming trees to create
   unique multiplex entry names or labels. Since the SONET multiplexing
   structure may be seen as a subset of the SDH multiplexing structure,
   the same format of label is used for SDH and SONET. A label does not
   identify the "class" to which the label belongs. This is implicitly
   determined by the link on which the label is used. However, the
   encoding specified hereafter makes the direct distinction between
   SDH and SONET.

   In case of signal concatenation or bundling, a list of sub-ordinate
   labels will appear in a Label List TLV.

   In case of virtual or arbitrary concatenation, the explicit list of
   all signals in the concatenation is given. The signals identified by
   these labels are virtually concatenated to form the SDH or SONET
   signal trail. The above representation limits virtual concatenation
   to remain within a single (component) link.

   In case of bundling, the explicit list of all signals that take part
   in the bundeling is given. An example of bundling is inverse
   multiplexing.  This is useful when a higher order signal need to be
   transported over a number of lower order signals, e.g. when a 10Gbps
   signal must be transported over four 2.5Gbps signals. In that case,
   the lower order signals must follow exactly the same path, and be
   treated in the same way, in order to achieve the same
   characteristics (e.g. delay).

             draft-sadler-gsmp-tdm-labels-00.txt     November 2000



   The format of the label for an SDH or SONET TDM-LSR link is:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |x|x|x|x|   SDH Label (0xNNN)   |          Label Length         |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |               S               |   U   |   K   |   L   |   M   |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Bits 0 through 3 are as defined in Section 3.1.3 of [2].

   For SDH, this coding is based on an extension of the numbering
   scheme defined in G.707 section 7.3, i.e. the (K, L, M) numbering.
   For SONET, the U and K fields are not significant for SONET and MUST
   be set to zero.  Only the S, L and M fields are significant for
   SONET and have a similar meaning as for SDH.

   Each letter indicates a possible branch number starting at the
   parent node in the multiplexing structure. Branches are considered
   as numbered in the increasing order, starting from the top of the
   multiplexing structure. The numbering starts at 1.  Zero is used to
   indicate a non-significant field.

   When a field is not significant in a particular context it MUST be
   set to zero when transmitted, and MUST be ignored when received.
   This simple rule allows distinguishing very easily between an SDH
   label and an SONET label.  A label with U=0 will always indicate a
   SONET label.  This is a nice feature for debugging purposes.  Note
   that it is easier to test U and K together, rather than only the U
   field alone, since they fit exactly in the third octet of the label.

   1. S is the index of a particular STM-1/STS-1 signal. S=1->N
   indicates a specific STM-1/STS-1 inside an STM-N/STS-N multiplex.
   For example, S=1 indicates the first STM-1/STS-1, and S=N indicates
   the last STM-1/STS-1 of this multiplex. S=0 is invalid.

   2. U is only significant for SDH and must be ignored for SONET. It
   indicates a specific VC inside a given STM-1. U=1 indicates a single
   VC-4, while U=2->4 indicates a specific VC-3 inside the given STM-1.

   3. K is only significant for SDH and must be ignored for SONET. It
   indicates a specific branch of a VC-4. K=1 indicates that the VC-4
   is not further sub-divided and contains a C-4. K=2->4 indicates a
   specific TUG-3 inside the VC-4. K is not significant when the STM-1
   is divided into VC-3s.

   4. L indicates a specific branch of a TUG-3, VC-3 or STS-1 SPE. It
   is not significant for an unstructured VC-4. L=1 indicates that the
   TUG-3/VC-3/STS-1 SPE is not further sub-divided and contains a VC-
   3/C-3 in SDH or the equivalent in SONET. L=2->8 indicates a specific
   TUG-2/VT Group inside the corresponding higher order signal.

             draft-sadler-gsmp-tdm-labels-00.txt     November 2000



   5. M indicates a specific branch of a TUG-2/VT Group. It is not
   significant for an unstructured VC-4, TUG-3, VC-3 or STS-1 SPE. M=1
   indicates that the TUG-2/VT Group is not further sub-divided and
   contains a VC-2/VT-6. M=2->3 indicates a specific VT-3 inside the
   corresponding VT Group.  These values must not be used for SDH since
   there is no equivalent of VT-3 in SDH. M=4->6 indicates a specific
   /VC-12/VT-2 inside the corresponding TUG-2/VT Group.  M=7->10
   indicates a specific VC-11/VT-1.5 inside the corresponding TUG-2/VT
   Group.  Note that M=0 denotes an unstructured VC-4, VC-3 or STS-1
   SPE.

   The M encoding is summarized in the following table:

      M           SDH                             SONET
    ----------------------------------------------------------
      0           unstructured VC-4/VC-3         unstructured STS-1 SPE
      1           VC-2                            VT-6
      2           -                               1st VT-3
      3           -                               2nd VT-3
      4           1st VC-12                       1st VT-2
      5           2nd VC-12                       2nd VT-2
      6           3rd VC-12                       3rd VT-2
      7           1st VC-11                       1st VT-1.5
      8           2nd VC-11                       2nd VT-1.5
      9           3rd VC-11                       3rd VT-1.5
      10          4th VC-11                       4th VT-1.5

   For instance,

   Example 1: S>0, U=1, K=1, L=0, M=0
   Denotes the unstructured VC-4 of the Sth STM-1.

   Example 2: S>0, U=1, K>1, L=1, M=0
   Denotes the unstructured VC-3 of the Kth TUG-3 of the Sth STM-1.

   Example 3: S>0, U>0, K=0, L=0, M=0
   Denotes the unstructured STS-1 SPE of the Sth STM-1.

   Example 4: S>0, U=0, K=0, L>1, M=1
   Denotes the VT-6 of the Lth VT Group in the Sth STS-1.

   Example 5: S>0, U=0, K=0, L>1, M=9
   Denotes the 3rd VT-1.5 of the Lth VT Group in the Sth STS-1.

5.2 PDH labels

   The Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy defines signals that do not
   guarantee a common reference clock.  As a result, PDH signals do not
   contain any fields to compensate for clocks that are out of
   alignment unlike SDH and SONET.

             draft-sadler-gsmp-tdm-labels-00.txt     November 2000


   Many different bodies have standardized plesiochronous signal
   hierarchies, including the American National Standards Institute
   (ANSI), and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute
   (ETSI).  The vast majority of today∆s telecom networks are covered
   by these standards.  The rest of this section will define the label
   formats for these two hierarchies.

5.2.1 ANSI PDH formats

   The fundamental building block of the ANSI PDH standards is the DS0.
   Operating as 8 bits transmitted 8,000 times a second, this signal
   provides an operational data rate of 64 kbps.  This signal can be
   delivered natively over copper wires (typically as a Digital Data
   Service), or can be multiplexed into a higher order signal.

   A DS1 signal consists of DS1 overhead (framing) and 24 DS0
   timeslots.  Any multiple of timeslots can be allocated to client
   signals with no requirement that concatenated client signals be
   assigned contiguous timeslots.

   A DS2 signal consists of DS2 overhead (framing) and either 4 DS1s or
   3 E1s client signals.  The client signals are mapped as sub-frames
   and blocks into the DS2 signal.  Because the sub-frame formats are
   not compatible between the two different client types, DS2s must be
   provisioned for a specific client type.  No mixing of client types
   within the DS2 is allowed.  Concatenation of client signals is
   allowed, but requires that the DS1 or E1 client signals in the DS2
   be clock synchronized.

   A DS3 signal consists of DS3 overhead (framing) and 7 DS2s client
   signals.  Again, concatenation of DS2 signals is allowed, but again
   requires that the DS2 client signals be clock synchronized.

   Many different framing bit formats exist for DS1, DS2 and DS3
   services.  These formats are attributes of the termination function
   and do not have any bearing on the label formats used by the
   connection function.  Therefore they are considered outside the
   scope of this document.

5.2.1.1 DS1 labels

5.2.1.1.1 Unstructured DS1

   An Unstructured DS1 service is used to connect a complete DS1
   without terminating any of the framing or payload component signals.

   No special Unstructured DS1 label is defined.  The use of an
   unstructured DS1 connection function will be either implicit from
   the port being referenced, or from the higher order label
   definition.  When a whole port is being referenced in a GSMP
   signaling message, the label to be included will be (implicit NULL).

5.2.1.1.2 DS0 in DS1

             draft-sadler-gsmp-tdm-labels-00.txt     November 2000



   The DS0 in DS1 label is used to specify the application of a DS0
   connection function to a specific DS0 within a DS1.  The DS1 will be
   terminated regardless of whether the service is presented on a DS1
   or higher service or port.  Where to locate the higher order
   termination function(s) within a switch is up to the implementation.

   The label format for a DS0 label in DS1 is as follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Bits 0 through 31 are defined in Sections 3.1.3 and 3.1.3.2 of [2].

   C:  Channel Number within the DS1.  The numbering starts at 1 and
      ends at 24 referencing DS1 channels 1 to 24, respectively.
      Values 0 and 25 to 31 are invalid.

5.2.1.2 DS2 labels

5.2.1.2.1 DS1 in DS2

   The DS1 in DS2 label is used to specify the application of a DS1
   connection function to a specific DS1 within a DS2.  The DS2 will be
   terminated regardless of whether the service is presented on a DS2
   or higher service or port.  Where to locate the higher order
   termination function(s) within a switch is up to the implementation.

   The label format for a DS1 service in DS2 is as follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3

   will be terminated regardless of whether the service is presented on
   a DS2 or higher service or port.  Where to locate the higher order
   termination function(s) within a switch is up to the implementation.

   The label format for an E1 in DS2 service is as follows:

5.2.1.3 DS3 labels

5.2.1.3.1 DS1 or E1 in DS3

   The label format for a DS1 or E1 in DS3 service is as follows:

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Bits 0 through 31 are defined in Sections 3.1.3 and 3.1.3.2 of [2].

   D:  DS2 within the DS3.  The numbering starts at 1 and ends at 7.
      The value of 0 is invalid.

   E:  DS2 Service type flag.  If E=0, then DS2 service type is DS1.
      If E=1, then DS2 service type is E1.  This behavior is for all
      services within the specified DS2.

   C:  DS1 or E1 within the DS2 sub-multiplex.  For DS2s containing
      DS1s, the numbering starts at 1 and ends at 4.  For DS2s
      containing E1s, the numbering starts at 1 and ends at 3.  All
      other values, including 0, are invalid.


   For instance,

   Example 1:  D=3, E=1, C=2
      Denotes the second E1 in the third DS2 in a DS3.

   Example 2:  D=2, E=0, C=4
      Denotes the fourth DS1 in the second DS2 in a DS3.

   Example 3:  D=3, E=0, C=1
      Denotes the first DS1 in the third DS2 in a DS3.

   NOTE: Example 3 and Example 1 shown above cannot be specified on the
      same port at the same time.  The DS2 service type must be
      consistent within the same DS2.

5.2.1.3.2 Unstructured DS3

   An Unstructured DS3 service is used to connect a complete DS3
   without terminating any of the framing or payload component signals.

   No special Unstructured DS3 label is defined.  The use of an
   unstructured DS3 connection function will be either implicit from
   the port being referenced, or from the higher order label
   definition.  When a whole port is being referenced in a GSMP
   signaling message, the label to be included will be (implicit NULL).

5.2.2 ETSI PDH formats

   The fundamental building block of the ETSI PDH standards is the E0.
   As in the ANSI PDH format, the E0 operates as 8 bits transmitted
   8000 times a second providing an operational data rate of 64 kbps.
   This signal can be delivered natively over copper wires (typically
   as a Digital Data Service), or can be multiplexed into a higher
   order signal.

   A E1 signal consists overhead (framing) and .

   A E1 signal consists of DS1 overhead (framing) and 30 E0 timeslots.
   Any multiple of timeslots can be allocated to client signals with no
   requirement that concatenated client signals be assigned contiguous
   timeslots.

   A E3 signal consists of E3 overhead (framing) and 16 E1 client
   signals.  Concatenation of E1 client signals is allowed.

5.2.2.1 E1 labels

5.2.2.1.1 E0 in E1

   The E0 in E1 label is used to specify the application of an E0
   connection function to a specific E0 within an E1.  The E1 will be
   terminated regardless of whether the service is presented on an E1
   or higher service or port.  Where to locate the higher order
   termination function(s) within a switch is up to the implementation.

   Bits 0 through 31 are defined in Sections 3.1.3 and 3.1.3.2 of [2].

   C:  Channel Number within the E1.  The numbering starts at 1 and
      ends at 32 referencing E1 channels 1 to 32, respectively.  Values
      0 and 33 to 63 are invalid.

5.2.2.1.2 Unstructured E1

   An Unstructured E1 service is used to connect a complete E1 without
   terminating any of the framing or payload component signals.

   No special Unstructured E1 label is defined.  The use of an
   unstructured E1 connection function will be either implicit from the
   port being referenced, or from the higher order label definition.
   When a whole port is being referenced in a GSMP signaling message,
   the label to be included will be (implicit NULL).

5.2.2.2 E3 labels

5.2.2.2.1 E1 in E3

   The E1 in E3 label is used to specify the application of an E1
   connection function to a specific E1 within an E3.  The E3 will be
   terminated regardless of whether the service is presented on an E3
   or higher service or port.  Where to locate the higher order
   termination function(s) within a switch is up to the implementation.

   The label format for a E1 in E3 service is as follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3

5.2.2.2.2 Unstructured E3

   An Unstructured E3 service is used to connect a complete E3 without
   terminating any of the framing or payload component signals.

   No special Unstructured E3 label is defined.  The use of an
   unstructured E3 connection function will be either implicit from the
   port being referenced, or from the higher order label definition.
   When a whole port is being referenced in a GSMP signaling message,
   the label to be included will be (implicit NULL).

6. Port and Wavelength Labels

   Some configurations of fiber switching (FSC) and lambda switching
   (LSC) use multiple data channels/links controlled by a single
   control channel.  In such cases the label indicates the data
   channel/link to be used.

   The format of a Port and Wavelength label is:

       0                   1                   2                   3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Bits 0 through 31 are defined in Sections 3.1.3 and 3.1.3.2 of [2].

      Label: 32 bits

        Indicates port/fiber or lambda to be used. Valid values are
        dependent on the number of component signals that are supported
        by the underlying port.  However, 0 is used to refer to the
        whole port including overhead, regardless of multiplexing
        supported.  When this is used, the input signal MUST be
        transparently connected to the output port.
