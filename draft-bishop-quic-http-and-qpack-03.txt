                    Header Compression for HTTP/QUIC
                  draft-bishop-quic-http-and-qpack-03

Abstract

   HTTP/2 [RFC7540] uses HPACK [RFC7541] for header compression.
   However, HPACK relies on the in-order message-based semantics of the
   HTTP/2 framing layer in order to function.  Messages can only be
   successfully decoded if processed by the decoder in the same order as
   generated by the encoder.  This draft refines HPACK to loosen the
   ordering requirements for use over QUIC [I-D.ietf-quic-transport].

1.  Introduction

   HPACK has a number of features that were intended to provide
   performance advantages to HTTP/2, but which don't live well in an
   out-of-order environment such as that provided by QUIC.

   The largest challenge is the fact that elements are referenced by a
   very fluid index.  Not only is the index implicit when an item is
   added to the header table, the index will change without notice as
   other items are added to the header table.  Static entries occupy the
   first 61 values, followed by dynamic entries.  A newly-added dynamic
   entry would cause older dynamic entries to be evicted, and the
   retained items are then renumbered beginning with 62.  This means
   that, without processing all preceding header sets, no index into the
   dynamic table can be interpreted, and the index of a given entry
   cannot be predicted.

   Any solution to the above will almost certainly fall afoul of the
   memory constraints the decompressor imposes.  The automatic eviction
   of entries is done based on the compressor's declared dynamic table

   size, which MUST be less than the maximum permitted by the
   decompressor (and relayed using an HTTP/2 SETTINGS value).

   Further, streams in QUIC are lossy in the presence of stream resets.
   While HTTP/2 (via TCP) guarantees the delivery of all previously-sent
   data on a stream even if that stream is reset, QUIC does not
   retransmit lost frames if a stream has been reset, and may discard
   data which has not yet been delivered to the application.

   Previous versions of QPACK were small deltas of HPACK to introduce
   order-resiliency.  This version departs from HPACK more substantially
   to add resilience against reset message streams.

   In the following sections, this document proposes a new version of
   HPACK which makes different trade-offs, enabling partial out-of-order
   interpretation and bounded memory consumption with minimal head-of-
   line blocking.  None of the proposed improvements to HPACK (strongly-
   typed fields, binary compression of common header syntax) are
   currently included, but certainly could be.

1.1.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14,
   [RFC2119] and indicate requirement levels for compliant
   implementations.

2.  QPACK

2.1.  Basic model

   HPACK combines header table modification and message header emission
   in a single sequence of coded bytes.  QPACK bifurcates these into two
   channels:

   o  Connection-wide sets of table update instructions sent on non-
      request streams

   o  Non-modifying instructions which use the current header table
      state to encode message headers on request streams

   Because the per-message instructions introduce no changes to the
   header table state, no state is lost if these instructions are
   discarded due to a stream reset.  Because the updates to the header
   table supply their own order controls (the delete logic), they can be
   processed in any order and therefore delivered as messages using
   unidirectional QUIC streams.

2.2.  Changes to Static and Dynamic Tables

   QPACK uses two tables for associating header fields to indexes.  The
   static table is unchanged from [RFC7541].

   The dynamic table is a map from index to header field.  Indices are
   arbitrary numbers greater than the last index of the static table and
   less than 2^27.  Each insert instruction will specify the index being
   modified.  While any index MAY be chosen for a new entry, smaller
   numbers will yield better compression performance.

   The dynamic table is still constrained to the size specified by the
   decoder.  An attempt to add a header to the dynamic table which
   causes it to exceed the maximum size MUST be treated as an error by a
   decoder.  To enable encoders to reclaim space, encoders can delete
   entries in the dynamic table, but can only reuse the index or the
   space after receiving confirmation of a successful deletion.

   Because it is possible for QPACK frames to arrive which reference
   indices which have not yet been defined, such frames MUST wait until
   another frame has arrived and defined the index.  In order to guard
   against malicious peers, implementations SHOULD impose a time limit
   and treat expiration of the timer as a decoding error.

2.2.1.  Changes to Header Table Size

   HTTP/QUIC prohibits mid-stream changes of settings.  As a result,
   only one table size change is possible: From the value a client
   assumes during the 0-RTT flight to the actual value included in the
   server's SETTINGS frame.  The assumed value is required to be either
   a server's previous value or zero.  A server whose configuration has
   recently changed MAY overlook inadvertent violations of its maximum
   table size during the first round-trip.

   In the case that the value has increased, either from zero to a non-
   zero value or from the cached value to a higher value, no action is
   required by the client.  The encoder can simply begin using the
   additional space.  In the case that the value has decreased, the
   encoder MUST immediately emit delete instructions which, upon
   completion, would bring the table within the required size.

   Regardless of changes to header table size, the encoder MUST NOT add
   entries to the table which would result in a size greater than the
   maximum permitted.  This can imply that no additions are permitted
   while waiting for these delete instructions to complete.

2.2.2.  Dynamic Table State Synchronization

   In order to ensure table consistency, all modifications of the header
   table occur as separate messages rather than on request streams.
   Request streams contain only indexed and literal header entries.

   No entries are automatically evicted from the dynamic table.  Size
   management is purely the responsibility of the encoder, which MUST
   NOT exceed the declared memory size of the decoder.

   The encoder SHOULD track the following information about each entry
   in the table:

   o  The list of recently-active streams which reference the entry in a
      trailer block, if any

   o  The list of recently-active streams which reference the entry in a
      non-trailer block, if any

   "Recently-active" streams are those which are still open or were
   closed less than a reasonable number of RTTs ago.  An implementation
   MAY vary its definition of "recent" to trade off memory consumption
   and timely completion of deletes, and tracking no information is a
   functional (though potentially less performant) choice in this space.

   The encoder MUST consider memory as committed beginning when the
   indexed entry is assigned.

   When the encoder wishes to delete an inserted value, it flows through
   the following set of states:

   1.  *Delete requested.* The encoder emits a delete instruction
       indicating which streams might have referenced the entry.  The
       encoder MUST NOT reference the entry in any subsequent frame
       until this state machine has completed and MUST continue to
       include the entry in its calculation of consumed memory.

   2.  *Delete pending.* The decoder receives the delete instruction and
       checks the current state of its incoming streams (see
       Section 2.3.2.2).  If more references might arrive, it stores the
       streams still needed and waits for them to complete.

   3.  *Delete acknowledged.* The decoder has received all QPACK frames
       which reference the deleted value, and can safely delete the
       entry.  The decoder SHOULD promptly emit a Delete-Ack instruction
       on a header management stream.

Internet-Draft                    QPACK                      August 2017


   4.  *Delete completed.* When the encoder receives a Delete-Ack
       instruction acknowledging the delete, it no longer counts the
       size of the deleted entry against the table size and MAY emit
       insert instructions for the field with a new value.

2.3.  Header Management Streams

   Header management streams are unidirectional streams in either
   direction which contain a series of QPACK instructions with no
   message boundaries.  Data on these streams SHOULD be processed as
   soon as it arrives.

   This section describes the instructions which are possible on header
   management streams.

2.3.1.  Insert

   An addition to the header table starts with the '1' one-bit pattern,
   followed by the new index of the header represented as an integer
   with a 7-bit prefix.  This value is always greater than the number of
   entries in the static table.

   If the header field name matches the header field name of an entry
   stored in the static table or the dynamic table, the header field
   name can be represented using the index of that entry.  In this case,
   the index of the entry is represented as an integer with an 8-bit
   prefix (see Section 5.1 of [RFC7541]).  This value is always non-
   zero.

        0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      | 1 |       New Index (7+)      |
      +---+---+-----------------------+
      |          Name Index (8+)      |
      +---+---------------------------+
      | H |     Value Length (7+)     |
      +---+---------------------------+
      | Value String (Length octets)  |
      +-------------------------------+

                    Insert Header Field -- Indexed Name

   Otherwise, the header field name is represented as a string literal
   (see Section 5.2 of [RFC7541]).  A value 0 is used in place of the
   8-bit index, followed by the header field name.

      | H |     Value Length (7+)     |
      +---+---------------------------+
      | Value String (Length octets)  |
      +-------------------------------+

                      Insert Header Field -- New Name

   Either form of header field name representation is followed by the
   header field value represented as a string literal (see Section 5.2
   of [RFC7541]).

   An encoder MUST NOT attempt to place a value at an index not known to
   be vacant.  A decoder MUST treat the attempt to insert into an
   occupied slot as a fatal error.

2.3.2.  Delete

   A deletion from the header table starts with the '00' two bit
   pattern, followed by the index of the affected entry represented as
   an integer with a 6-bit prefix.  This value is always greater than
   the number of entries in the static table.

   A delete instruction then encodes a series of stream IDs which might
   have contained references to the entry in question.

        0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

      +-------------------------------+
      |       Trailer List (*)      ...

   Both the Non-Trailer List and Trailer List are Stream ID Lists (see
   below) encoding a list of streams which might have referenced the
   entry either in non-trailer or trailer blocks.

2.3.2.1.  Stream ID List

   A Stream ID List encodes a sequence of stream IDs in two parts:
   First, a Horizon value indicates the first non-occurrence about which
   data is maintained.  If data is maintained from the beginning of the
   connection, the Horizon is zero.  This allows senders to succinctly
   express both old state which has been discarded and large regions
   where many or all streams contain references.

   Following the horizon, a sequence of deltas indicates all streams
   since the Horizon on which a value has been used.

   This structure permits either side to adjust the amount of tracking
   complexity it is willing to devote to ensure timely deletions.  In
   the simplest case, a Stream ID List might be a horizon value followed
   by one zero byte.  This indicates an absolute cut-off after which the
   entry is guaranteed not to be referenced, and requires the receiver
   to wait until all prior requests have been completed.  Similarly, the
   receiver can create equivalent-but-less-complex forms of a Stream ID
   list by increasing the Horizon value and discarding all explicit
   stream entries less than the new value.

        0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
      +-------------------------------+
      |          Horizon (8+)         |
      +-------------------------------+
      |         NumEntries (8+)       |
      +-------------------------------+
      |         [Delta1 (8+)]         |
      +-------------------------------+
      |         [Delta2 (8+)]         |
      +-------------------------------+
                     ...
      +-------------------------------+
      |         [DeltaN (8+)]         |
      +-------------------------------+

                              Stream ID List

   The field are as follows:

   Horizon:  The ID of the first stream for which the sender retains
      state which does not reference the deleted entry in the indicated
      block

Internet-Draft                    QPACK                      August 2017


   NumEntries:  The number of streams greater than the Horizon which
      might reference the entry and are listed in the remainder of the
      instruction

   Delta1..N:  A sequence of streams greater than the Horizon which
      might reference the entry, encoded as the difference in stream
      number from the previously-listed stream.  This field is repeated
      NumEntries times.

2.3.2.2.  Delete Validation

   In order to safely delete an entry, a decoder MUST ensure that all
   outstanding references have arrived and been processed.  Because no
   data is available about stream IDs less than the Horizon, a decoder
   MUST assume that any earlier stream ID might have contained a
   reference to the value in question.

   A decoder can ensure all outstanding references have been processed
   by verifying that the following statements are true:

   o  In the Non-Trailer Block, all streams less than the Horizon and
      all streams explicitly listed are in one of two states:

      *  closed

      *  headers completely processed

   o  In the Trailer Block, all streams less than the Horizon and all
      streams explicitly listed are in one of three states:

      *  closed

      *  headers completely processed AND no trailers are expected

      *  trailers completely processed

   An implementation MAY omit the "trailers completely processed" case,
   since the stream is expected to close immediately after receipt of
   the trailers block.

   If these conditions are not met upon receipt of a Delete instruction,
   a decoder MUST wait to emit a Delete-Ack instruction until the
   outstanding streams have reached an appropriate state.

   Note that a decoder MAY condense the list of specified streams by
   increasing the Horizon value and discarding those explicitly-listed
   stream IDs which are less than the new Horizon it has chosen.  This
   delays delete completion, but reduces the amount of state to be

   tracked by the decoder without changing the correctness of the
   requirements above.

2.3.3.  Delete-Ack

   Confirmation that a delete has completed is expressed by an
   instruction which starts with the '01' two-bit pattern, followed by
   the index of the affected entry represented as an integer with a
   6-bit prefix.  This value is always greater than the number of
   entries in the static table.

   Note that unlike all other instructions, this instruction refers to
   the receiver's dynamic table, not the sender's.

        0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      | 0 | 1 |      Index (6+)       |
      +---+---+-----------------------+

                          Delete-Ack Instruction

   This instruction MUST NOT be sent before the conditions described in
   Section 2.3.2.2 have been satisfied, and SHOULD be sent as soon as
   possible once they are.

2.4.  Format of Encoded Headers on Message Streams

   Frames which carry HTTP message headers encode them using the
   following instructions:

2.4.1.  Indexed Header Field Representation

   An indexed header field representation identifies an entry in either
   the static table or the dynamic table and causes that header field to
   be added to the decoded header list, as described in Section 3.2 of
   [RFC7541].

     0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   | 1 |        Index (7+)         |
   +---+---------------------------+

                           Indexed Header Field

   An indexed header field starts with the '1' 1-bit pattern, followed
   by the index of the matching header field, represented as an integer
   with a 7-bit prefix (see Section 5.1 of [RFC7541]).




Bishop                  Expires February 15, 2018              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft                    QPACK                      August 2017


   The index value of 0 is not used.  It MUST be treated as a decoding
   error if found in an indexed header field representation.

2.4.2.  Literal Header Field Representation

   A literal header field representation starts with the '0' 1-bit
   pattern and causes a header field to be added the decoded header
   list.

   The second bit, 'N', indicates whether an intermediary is permitted
   to add this header to the dynamic header table on subsequent hops.
   When the 'N' bit is set, the encoded header MUST always be encoded
   with this specific literal representation.  In particular, when a
   peer sends a header field that it received represented as a literal
   header field with the 'N' bit set, it MUST use the same
   representation to forward this header field.  This bit is intended
   for protecting header field values that are not to be put at risk by
   compressing them (see Section 7.1 of [RFC7541] for more details).

   If the header field name matches the header field name of an entry
   stored in the static table or the dynamic table, the header field
   name can be represented using the index of that entry.  In this case,
   the index of the entry is represented as an integer with a 6-bit
   prefix (see Section 5.1 of [RFC7541]).  This value is always non-
   zero.

                   Literal Header Field -- Indexed Name

   Otherwise, the header field name is represented as a string literal
   (see Section 5.2 of [RFC7541]).  A value 0 is used in place of the
   6-bit index, followed by the header field name.

   Either form of header field name representation is followed by the
   header field value represented as a string literal (see Section 5.2).

3.  Use in HTTP/QUIC

   HTTP/QUIC [I-D.ietf-quic-http] currently retains the HPACK encoder/
   decoder from HTTP/2, using a Sequence number to enforce ordering.
   Using QPACK instead would entail the following changes:

   o  The Sequence field is removed from HEADERS frames (Section 5.2.2)
      and PUSH_PROMISE frames (Section 5.2.6).

   o  Header Block Fragments consist of QPACK data instead of HPACK
      data.

   o  Just as unidirectional push streams have a stream header
      identifying their type and Push ID, a header will need to be added
      to differentiate header table update streams from requests and
      pushes.

   A HEADERS or PUSH_PROMISE frame MAY contain an arbitrary number of
   QPACK instructions, but QPACK instructions SHOULD NOT cross a
   boundary between successive HEADERS frames.  A partial HEADERS or
   PUSH_PROMISE frame MAY be processed upon arrival and the resulting
   partial header set emitted or buffered according to implementation
   requirements.

4.  Performance Considerations

   While QPACK is designed to minimize head-of-line blocking between
   streams on header decoding, there are some situations in which lost
   or delayed packets can still impact the performance of header
   compression.

   References to indexed entries will block if the frame containing the
   entry definition is lost or delayed.  Encoders MAY choose to trade
   off compression efficiency and avoid blocking by using literal
   instructions rather than referencing the dynamic table until the
   insertion is believed to be complete.

   Since it is possible to insert header values without emitting them on
   a stream, an encoder MAY proactively insert header values which it
   believes will be needed on future requests.

   Delayed frames which prevent deletes from completing can prevent the
   encoder from adding any new entries due to the maximum table size.
   This does not block the encoder from continuing to make requests, but
   could sharply limit compression performance.  Encoders would be well-
   served to delete entries in advance of encountering the table
   maximum.  Decoders SHOULD be prompt about emitting Delete-Ack
   instructions to enable the encoder to recover the table space.

   The ability to split updates to the header table into discrete
   messages reduces the possibility for head-of-line blocking within the
   table update streams.  Implementations SHOULD limit the size of table
   update messages to avoid head-of-line blocking within these messages.

5.  Security Considerations

   A malicious encoder might attempt to consume a large amount of space
   on the decoder by opening the maximum number of streams, adding
   entries to the table, then sending delete instructions enumerating
   many streams in a Stream ID List.

   To guard against such attacks, a decoder SHOULD bound its state
   tracking by generalizing the list of streams to be tracked.  This is
   most easily achieved by advancing the Horizon to a later value and
   discarding explicit Stream IDs to track, but can also be accomplished
   by eliding explicit streams in ranges.  This does not cause any loss
   of consistency for deletes, but could delay completion and reduce
   performance if done aggressively.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document currently makes no request of IANA, and might not need
   to.
