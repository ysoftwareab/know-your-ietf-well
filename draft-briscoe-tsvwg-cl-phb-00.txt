   service is a quality of service (QoS) closely approximating the QoS 
   that same flow would receive from a lightly loaded network element 
   [RFC2211]. CL service is useful for inelastic flows such as those for 
   streaming real-time media.  

   Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) marking semantics are defined 
   as part of the PHBs, to provide an "early warning" of potential 
   congestion. The PHBs can be used as a basic building block within an 
   edge-to-edge (CL-ramp-PHB) or end-to-end (CL-step-PHB) QoS 
   architecture, using distributed measurement-based admission control.

Internet-Draft    Controlled Load per hop behaviour          July 2005 
    

1. Overview and motivation 

   Network nodes that implement the differentiated services (DS) 
   enhancements to IP use a codepoint in the IP header to select a per-
   hop behaviour (PHB) as the specific forwarding treatment for that 
   packet [RFC2474, RFC2475]. This document describes two new PHBs 
   called Controlled Load (CL) ramp and step (CL-ramp-PHB and CL-step-
   PHB).  

   The Quality of Service (QoS) that can be achieved with the PHBs 
   corresponds to the Integrated services Controlled Load (CL) class, 
   that is [RFC2211]: "a quality of service closely approximating the 
   QoS that same flow would receive from [a network element that is] 
   lightly loaded". 

   The CL PHBs are different from PHBs defined so far, in that they 
   define Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) marking semantics as 
   part of the PHB. [RFC3168] specifies the default ECN marking 
   behaviour of an ECN-capable router for currently standardised PHBs, 
   but allows new PHBs to define different ECN marking behaviour. The 
   default behaviour is to indicate incipient congestion by setting the 
   Congestion Experienced (CE) codepoint in the IP header of packets, 
   with a probability determined by the RED algorithm [RFC2309] based on 
   the moving average queue length - so packets have their CE codepoint 
   set at the same point that a non-ECN-capable router would drop them.  

   This document specifies a different behaviour: a node sets the CE 
   codepoint in the IP header as an "early warning" of potential 
   congestion, and aims to do so before there is any significant build-
   up of CL packets in the queue. This information enables appropriate 
   action to be taken to heed the "early warning" so that the router 
   should never become overloaded and forced to queue packets, and hence 
   the service achieves a higher performance. One example of an 
   'appropriate action' is that an ingress gateway blocks new microflows 
   (Section 3.2 and [CL-arch]). Hence it is possible for the CL packets 
   to suffer minimal queuing delay, jitter and loss - exactly the 
   requirements of real time traffic.  
   So a node using a CL PHB generates ECN signalling and is also part of 
   a system of other nodes in a closed feedback loop, which allows 
   control of the offered load on the local queue. To summarise: the CL 
   PHBs provide QoS by virtue of their local scheduling behaviour, in 
   combination with admission control. 
    

   The basic concepts are:

Internet-Draft    Controlled Load per hop behaviour          July 2005 
    

   o Setting the CE codepoint: the router sets the CE codepoint of CL 
      packets before it is actually congested (but when congestion is 
      fairly imminent). Reason: it enables appropriate action to be 
      taken so that actual congestion is not experienced, and hence a 
      very low loss, delay and jitter service is possible.  

   o Discarding: CL packets should not need to be discarded, but if 
      necessary packets would be discarded on a drop tail basis. 

   o Priority queuing: at a minimum for the CL-ramp-PHB with adaptive 
      bandwidth (see below), CL packets are prioritised before non-CL 
      packets, ie they are always de-queued first. Reason: This 
      minimises CL packets' delay and jitter.  

   o Reordering: CL packets within a flow must not be reordered, for 
      example this can be achieved with a first-in-first-out (FIFO) 
      queue. Reason: packet reordering significantly degrades the 
      performance of real time applications.  

   o Selecting the output link: the router selects the link on which to 
      forward the packet based on normal IP routing. 

   To indicate that this new behaviour is required, packets are marked 
   with one of two new Differentiated Services Codepoints (DSCPs). It is 
   hoped that (an evolution of) the CL PHBs is standardised, which 
   requires each PHB to have an associated RECOMMENDED DSCP. RECOMMENDED 
   DSCPs, rather than EXP/LU (experimental / local use) ones, enable 
   multi-domain operation and vendor interoperability. 

    

   Two usage scenarios are suggested in Section 3 (others are possible): 

   o A host-to-host service, potentially through several domains, using 
      the CL-step-PHB 

   o An edge-to-edge service across a single domain or across 
      cooperating domains, using the CL-ramp-PHB. 

   How the CL PHBs can co-exist with existing DiffServ (DS) PHBs and 
   with the default [RFC3168] ECN behaviour is discussed in Sections 2.6 
   and 2.7.  

   The CL PHBs - unlike the PHBs for Expedited Forwarding [RFC3246] and 
   Assured Forwarding [RFC2597] - do not require routers to be 
   configured with a minimum departure rate, although it is not 
   precluded.

   There are two CL PHB groups each of which consists of a single 
   individual PHB. They are intended for general or local use.  

   One motivation for this specification is that some network operators 
   are planning to carry all their traffic on a single unified network, 
   because this is expected to reduce operating costs dramatically. 
   Therefore such a network must carry real time inelastic flows like 
   voice and video calls, which are very delay sensitive. Per microflow 
   reservations are too unwieldy in the core and backbone of the 
   network. It is possible to achieve low delays in the core and 
   backbone with DS today, by triggering flow admission control when 
   traffic entering a DS domain exceeds its contracted rate. But for 
   longer topologies, the chances increase that traffic will focus on a 
   resource near the egress, even though it is within contract at the 
   ingress [Reid]. This is because the ingress contract must allow any 
   destination address, if it is to remain scalable. Even though 
   networks can be engineered to make such failures rare, when they 
   occur all inelastic flows through the congested resource fail 
   catastrophically.  

    

2. Detail 

   The CL PHBs define forwarding behaviour for packets in the CL 
   behaviour aggregate.  

2.1. Queuing 

   CL and non-CL packets are put into logically separate queues; if 
   required, a CL packet can pre-empt non-CL packet(s) in the total 
   buffer (see below). 

2.2. Setting the Congestion Experienced (CE) codepoint 

   A CL implementation in a DS node MUST detect and respond to potential 
   congestion within the CL traffic aggregate by setting the CE 
   codepoint of CL packets, with a probability determined by the 
   algorithms described below, when it forwards them. 'Potential 
   congestion' means a little before the CL packets start suffering a 
   significant delay due to queuing in the node.  
   There are two PHBs with slightly different behaviour: 
   1. CL-step-PHB: The probability that a node sets the CE codepoint of 
      a packet is either 0 or 1 (ie 'on' or 'off').

Internet-Draft    Controlled Load per hop behaviour          July 2005 
    

   2. CL-ramp-PHB: The probability that a node sets the CE codepoint of 
      a packet can be any value. 

   Implementation details include the precise algorithm and the value of 
   its parameters.  
2.2.1. Possible algorithms for setting the CE codepoint 

   Each node in the CL-region runs an algorithm to determine whether to 
   set the CE codepoint of a particular CL packet. In our description we 
   assume that a bulk token bucket is used (note that there is not a 
   token bucket per microflow). Tokens are added when packets are queued 
   and are consumed at a fixed rate. The idea is that an excess of 
   tokens is seen before the queue of CL packets has got long enough to 
   cause the CL packets to suffer a significant delay - the algorithms 
   are explained more fully below and are slightly different for the CL-
   step-PHB and CL-ramp-PHB. Other implementations are possible. 
    
   The two CL PHBs use different algorithms for determining how the 
   amount of tokens whether a packet has its CE codepoint set: 
   1. CL-step: The CE codepoint setting is either 'on' or 'off'. As soon 
      as the amount of tokens is greater than a threshold value, then 
      all CL-step packets have their CE codepoint set. To prevent 
      instability, the metering function has built-in hysterisis, ie 
      this continues until the amount of tokens has decreased below a 
      second threshold value.  

   2. CL-ramp: There are two alternatives described in detail in [CL-
      arch]: 

   o Configured bandwidth: the node has a fixed maximum bandwidth 
      allocated to CL-ramp traffic, under the control of management 
      configuration. Tokens are consumed slightly slower than this rate. 
      The probability that a node sets the CE codepoint of a CL-ramp 
      packet depends on the number of tokens in the bucket. Below one 
      threshold value of the number of tokens no packets have their CE 
      codepoint set and above the second they all do; in between, the 
      probability increases linearly.

Internet-Draft    Controlled Load per hop behaviour          July 2005 
    

   o Flexible bandwidth: the node allows an adaptive trade-off between 
      CL-ramp and non-CL-ramp traffic. Tokens are consumed at slightly 
      less than the (total) outgoing service rate. The probability that 
      a node sets the CE codepoint of a CL packet depends on the number 
      of tokens in the bucket *plus* the number of queued non-CL 
      packets. Below one threshold value of this sum no packets have 
      their CE codepoint set and above the second they all do; in 
      between, the probability increases linearly. 

   In the flexible bandwidth case, the probability reflects the load of 
   both CL and non-CL traffic. The reason is to ensure a 'fair balance' 
   between the two classes, by rejecting CL session requests if non-CL 
   demand is very high. Alternatively, if the number of queued non-CL 
   packets is not included, then the admission of a CL microflow is 
   independent of the amount of non-CL traffic.

2.3. Scheduling  

   In the CL-ramp case with flexible bandwidth, CL packets are always 
   scheduled ahead of non-CL ones, in order to minimise their delay and 
   jitter, and FIFO (First In First Out) scheduling is used to prevent 
   reordering within a CL microflow. This is needed because the arrival 
   rate of CL packets is unknown. The fixed bandwidth case has more 
   options, for example the CL-ramp and non-CL traffic could be serviced 
   by a Weighted Round Robin scheduler. 

2.4. Damage limitation 

   It is expected that setting the CE codepoint will enable appropriate 
   action to be taken early enough to prevent significant congestion. 
   However, in some circumstances (for instance if a node fails) it will 
   not be sufficient. Therefore, if a CL PHB is implemented by a 
   mechanism that allows unlimited pre-emption of other traffic (eg a 


 
 
Briscoe                Expires January 11 2006                [Page 8] 

Internet-Draft    Controlled Load per hop behaviour          July 2005 
    

   priority queue), the implementation SHOULD include some means to 
   limit the damage CL traffic could inflict on other traffic. 

2.5. Applicability of CL PHBs 

   It is suggested that the CL-step-PHB is defined for probing. One 
   advantage of the CL-step-PHB is that it sets the CE codepoint 
   immediately it notices there is potential congestion, so the 
   admission control can react to a single CE packet.  

   It is suggested that the CL-ramp-PHB is defined for either data or 
   probing. Advantages of the CL-ramp-PHB are that it can discriminate 
   between different levels of congestion and accumulate the congestion 
   signal across the network (so it can detect when several nodes are 
   experiencing a low level of congestion such that a step algorithm 
   would be 'off' in all nodes).  

   Use cases for the CL PHBs are briefly described in Section 3. 

2.6. Interaction with other PHBs 

   Other PHBs and PHB groups may be deployed in the same DS node or 
   domain with a CL PHB. CL traffic is prioritised over all other PHBs, 
   but the admission control procedure prevents the CL traffic affecting 
   their service.  

   It is believed that the CL-ramp-PHB configured and flexible bandwidth 
   cases belong to the same PHB because they can both be used in the 
   same domain, since the difference between them doesn't affect the way 
   the ingress and egress nodes do admission control and metering.  

   It is believed that the CL-step-PHB and CL-ramp-PHB are different 
   PHBs, because they cannot be used within the same domain, since the 
   CE codepoint is interpreted differently. With the CL-step-PHB a 
   single CE packet can cause the admission controller to block a new 
   microflow, whereas with the CL-ramp-PHB sufficient packets are needed 
   to estimate the congestion level. However, it would be possible to 
   use CL-step-PHB for probe traffic and CL-ramp-PHB for data traffic 
   within the same domain. 

2.7. Interaction with default ECN behaviour  

   The CL PHBs define behaviour for setting the CE codepoint that is 
   different from the default ECN marking behaviour [RFC3168]. To 
   address the concerns of [Floyd] it therefore must be ensured that the 
   packets only travel through nodes with a CL PHB. This could be done 
   by signalling (to verify that the nodes on the path all understand 
 
 
Briscoe                Expires January 11 2006                [Page 9]

   the CL PHB) or by configuration (eg in usage scenario 2 the whole 
   domain runs the CL-ramp-PHB). 

2.8. Mutability 

   CL packets with the ECN field cleared (`Not ECT') should be re-marked 
   to Best Effort. In most scenarios, all CL packets should be ECN-
   capable, so it MAY be appropriate to raise a suitable management 
   alarm the first time this is not the case. 

   In the edge-to-edge usage scenario, which is described below in 
   Section 3.2, if some packets of a CL microflow are over the 
   reservation at the ingress edge, then they SHOULD be marked to Best 
   Effort. 

2.9. Microflow misordering 

   Packets that belong to a single microflow within the CL behaviour 
   aggregate passing through a device SHOULD NOT be re-ordered in normal 
   operation of the device. In a microflow where packets are marked to 
   Best Effort by the ingress node (see Mutability sub-section) they may 
   become misordered, but note that these packets are never part of the 
   CL behaviour aggregate.  

2.10. Recommended codepoint for this PHB 

   Codepoint xxxxxx is RECOMMENDED for the CL-ramp-PHB and codepoint 
   xxxxxx is RECOMMENDED for the CL-step-PHB. RECOMMENDED codepoints are 
   needed, rather than EXP/LU ones, to enable host-to-host and inter-
   operator usage.   

2.11. Tunnelling 

   When CL packets are tunnelled, the tunnelling packets SHOULD be 
   marked as CL and the ECN field copied between headers as in RFC3168.   

2.12. Security Considerations 

   TBD

3. Use cases 

   Two possible usage scenarios for the CL PHBs are discussed in this 
   section: 

   o A host-to-host service, potentially through several domains 

   o An edge-to-edge service across a single domain or across 
      cooperating domains. 

    

3.1. Host-to-host service 

   This usage scenario is based on [RTECN-usage]. A source wanting to 
   establish a real time inelastic microflow sends probe packets, which 
   have their DSCP set to the value for the CL-step-PHB and the ECN 
   field set to the ECT codepoint. Nodes en route set the CE codepoint 
   if necessary as an "early warning" of potential congestion. The 
   receiver informs the source about the value(s) of the ECN field of 
   the probe packets, enabling the source to decide whether or not the 
   new microflow is acceptable. To ease migration, [RTECN] suggests that 
   to start with the mechanism is deployed in a limited number of nodes 
   - those known to be points where the bandwidth is constrained.    

    

3.2. Edge-to-edge service 

   This usage scenario is described more fully in [CL-arch]. The CL-
   ramp-PHB is used within a single domain. The ingress node to the 
   domain sets the DSCP to the value for the CL-ramp-PHB and the ECN 
   field set to the ECT codepoint. Nodes en route set the CE codepoint 
   if necessary as an "early warning" of potential congestion. The 
   egress node of the domain meters CL-ramp packets that have their CE 
   codepoint set. It calculates the fraction of the total (CL-ramp) bits 
   that are in CE packets. The calculation is done as an exponentially 
   weighted moving average ('Congestion-Level-Estimate'). Congestion-
   Level-Estimate provides an estimate of how near the domain is getting 
   to a load where the CL-ramp traffic will start suffering significant 
   delays. Note that the metering and calculation are done separately 
   for CL-ramp packets from each ingress router, because (as discussed 
   in Section 1) there may be sufficient capacity on all the nodes on 
   the path between one ingress node and a particular egress, but not 
   from a second ingress.

   In order to decide whether to admit a new real time inelastic 
   microflow, the current value for Congestion-Level-Estimate is 
   compared with a threshold value; if it is greater then the request is 
   refused, otherwise it is accepted. It would be possible to have 
   different service priorities (eg for emergency calls or important 
   users) by the ingress having different thresholds for Congestion-
   Level-Estimate. 

   The details depend on the end-to-end signalling protocol, but for 
   example with RSVP, Congestion-Level-Estimate is included as an opaque 
   object within the RESV message. If the current value for Congestion-
   Level-Estimate is unknown (eg if there are no microflows at present 
   between the relevant ingress and egress nodes), then probe packets 
   are sent, from which the egress node can initialise its meter. These 
   probe packets could use either the CL-ramp-PHB or the CL-step-PHB.  
   It is also possible for several adjacent domains to cooperate. Then 
   only the ingress and egress nodes of the combined region take part in 
   the admission control procedure; border nodes within the combined 
   region do not take part in signal processing or hold path state. The 
   domains can even be run by different operators; in this case the 
   border routers between operators only have to do bulk accounting - 
   per microflow metering and policing is not needed [Briscoe].
