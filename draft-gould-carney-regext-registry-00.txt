1.  Introduction

   This document describes an extension mapping for version 1.0 of the
   Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) [RFC5730].  This document
   describes a Domain Name Registry Mapping, referred to as Registry
   Mapping, for the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) [RFC5730].  A
   Domain Name Registry can service one or more registry zones (e.g.
   top-level domains) with a variety of supported services and policies.
   A registry zone, also referred to as a "zone" in this document, is a
   domain name that the Domain Name Registry supports provisioning
   operations to manage.  The registry zone and the associated DNS zone

Internet-Draft                  registry                        May 2018


   has an overlapping data set, where the registry zone is the source
   for the generation of a DNS zone.  A registry zone is typically a
   top-level domain name, but it can be a domain name at any domain name
   level.  A registry zone can be the source for multiple resolution
   services like DNS and WHOIS.

   This mapping enables the provisioning of the features and policies of
   the registry zones in the Domain Name Registry.  A Domain Name
   Registry MAY support a subset of all of the commands defined in this
   mapping and can authorize different clients to execute specific
   commands.  For example, all clients may be capable of executing the
   EPP Query Commands (Section 3.1), while internal clients or pre-
   defined external clients may be capable of executing the EPP
   Transform Commands (Section 3.2) for a specific set of zones.  It is
   up to server policy to define what clients are authorized to execute
   which commands on which registry zones.  The server policy can be
   defined out-of-band or in a seperate EPP extension.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   XML is case sensitive.  Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications
   and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the
   character case presented in order to develop a conforming
   implementation.

   In examples, "C:" represents lines sent by a protocol client and "S:"
   represents lines returned by a protocol server.  Indentation and
   white space in examples are provided only to illustrate element
   relationships and are not a REQUIRED feature of this protocol.

   The XML namespace prefix "registry" is used for the namespace
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:registry-0.1", but implementations MUST NOT
   depend on it and instead employ a proper namespace-aware XML parser
   and serializer to interpret and output the XML documents.

2.  Object Attributes

   An EPP registry object has attributes and associated values that may
   be viewed and modified by the sponsoring client or the server.  This
   section describes each attribute type in detail.  The formal syntax
   for the attribute values described here can be found in the "Formal
   Syntax" section of this document and in the appropriate normative
   references.

Internet-Draft                  registry                        May 2018


2.1.  Zone Name

   The zone name is an element that includes an optional "form"
   attribute that defines the form of the zone name as either "aLabel"
   or "uLabel", with the default value of "aLabel".  The "aLabel" form
   of a zone name contains all ASCII name labels that conform to
   [RFC0952] and [RFC1123].  The "uLabel" form of a zone name that
   includes one or more non-ASCII name labels that can be represented as
   ASCII labels using [RFC5890].

   At the time of this writing, [RFC5890] describes a standard to use
   certain ASCII name labels to represent non-ASCII name labels.  These
   conformance requirements might change in the future as a result of
   progressing work in developing standards for internationalized names.

2.2.  Dates and Times

   Date and time attribute values MUST be represented in Universal
   Coordinated Time (UTC) using the Gregorian calendar.  The extended
   date-time form using upper case "T" and "Z" characters defined in XML
   Schema Part 2 [1] MUST be used to represent date-time values, as XML
   Schema does not support truncated date-time forms or lower case "T"
   and "Z" characters.

2.3.  Schedule

   A schedule is defined using the <registry:schedule> element, in the
   time zone represented by the OPTIONAL "tz" attribute with the default
   of "UTC", and containing the first five crontab entry columns with
   the format:

   *     *     *   *    *
   -     -     -   -    -
   |     |     |   |    |
   |     |     |   |    +----- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0)
   |     |     |   +------- month (1 - 12)
   |     |     +--------- day of month (1 - 31)
   |     +----------- hour (0 - 23)
   +------------- min (0 - 59)

   * indicates any legal value
   A column can include a list of in range values seperated by commas,
   as in 2,14 "hour" for 2 AM and 2 PM.
   A column can include an inclusive range of values using two values
   seperated by a hyphen, as in (1-5) "day of week" for weekdays.

           "required" attribute that defines whether the server requires
           the use of object represented by the URI.
       <registry:svcExtension>:  An OPTIONAL element that contains one
           or more <registry:extURI> elements that contain namespace
           URIs representing object extensions support by the server for

           whether the server requires the use of the object extension
           represented by the URI.
   <registry:crID>:  The OPTIONAL identifier of the client that created
       the zone.
   <registry:crDate>:  The date and time of zone object creation.

           is auto approved by the server.  The
           <registry:transferHoldPeriod> element MUST have the "unit"
           attribute with the possible values of "y" for year, "m" for
           month, and "d" for day.
       <registry:privacyContactSupported>:  An OPTIONAL boolean value
           that indicates whether a privacy contact is supported with a
           default value of "true".
       <registry:proxyContactSupported>:  An OPTIONAL boolean value that
           indicates whether a proxy contact is supported with a default

3.  EPP Command Mapping

   A detailed description of the EPP syntax and semantics can be found
   in the EPP core protocol specification [RFC5730].  The command
   mappings described here are specifically for use in provisioning and
   managing TLD names via EPP.

3.1.  EPP Query Commands

   EPP [RFC5730] provides three commands to retrieve object information:
   <check> to determine if an object is known to the server, <info> to
   retrieve detailed information associated with an object, and
   <transfer> to retrieve object transfer status information.

3.1.1.  EPP <check> Command

   The EPP <check> command is used to determine if the server currently
   supports a zone.  If the response indicates that the zone is not
   available, then it is currently supported; otherwise it MAY be
   available to be created by an authorized client.

   In addition to the standard EPP command elements, the <check> command
   MUST contain a <registry:check> element that identifies the registry
   namespace.  The <registry:check> element contains the following child
   elements:

   <registry:name>:  One or more <registry:name> elements, as described
       in Section 2.1, that contain the fully qualified names of the
       zone objects to be queried.

   Example <check> command:

   C:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
   C:<epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
   C:  <command>
   C:    <check>

       element MUST contain an "avail" attribute whose value indicates
       zone is currently supported or availability at the moment the
       <check> command was completed for an authorized client.  A value
       of "1" or "true" means that the zone object is available for an
       authorized client.  A value of "0" or "false" means that the zone
       object is currently supported by the server.
   <registry:reason>:  The OPTIONAL element that MAY be provided when a
       zone object is not available for provisioning.  If present, this
       element contains server-specific text to help explain why the
       zone object is unavailable.  This text MUST be represented in the
       response language previously negotiated with the client; an
       OPTIONAL "lang" attribute MAY be present to identify the language
       if the negotiated value is something other than a default value
       of "en" (English).

3.1.2.  EPP <info> Command

   The EPP <info> command is used to retrieve information associated
   with a zone object.  The response to this command MAY vary depending
   on the identity of the querying client, use of authorization
   information, and server policy towards unauthorized clients.  Server
   policy determines which OPTIONAL elements are returned.

   In addition to the standard EPP command elements, the <info> command
   MUST contain a <registry:info> element that identifies the registry
   namespace.  The <registry:info> element contains one of the following
   three child elements:

   <registry:all>:  Element that is empty and that indicates that a list
       of all of the supported zone objects are queried with a summary
       set of attributes per zone object.
   <registry:name>:  Element that contains the fully qualified name of
       the zone object to be queried for a full set of attributes for
       the zone object.
   <registry:system>:  Element that is empty and that indicates that the
       registry system attributes, like maximum connections and
       timeouts, are queried.

   Example <info> command to query for a summary set of attributes for
   all of the supported zone objects:

   C:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
   C:<epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">

   When an <info> command has been processed successfully, the EPP
   <resData> element MUST contain a child <registry:infData> element
   that identifies the registry namespace.  The <registry:infData>
   element contains one of the three following child elements:

   <registry:zoneList>:  Element that contains the list of supported
       zones by the server with a set of summary attributes per zone.
       The <registry:zoneList> element contains the following child
       elements:


       <registry:name>:  Element that contains the fully qualified name
           of the queried zone object.
       <registry:crDate>:  The date and time of zone object creation.
       <registry:upDate>:  The OPTIONAL date and time of the most recent
           zone object modification.  This element MUST NOT be present
           if the zone object has never been modified.
   or a <registry:zone>:  Element that contains the full set of
       attributes for the zone name as defined in Section 2.4.
   <registry:system>:  Element that contains registry system attributes.
       The <registry:system> element contains the following child
       elements:


       <registry:maxConnections>:  The OPTIONAL element that contains
           the maximum number of connections that the client can
           establish with the registry system.
       <registry:idleTimeout>:  The OPTIONAL element that contains the
           idle timeout for a connection in milliseconds.  If a
           connection does not receive a command within
           <registry:idleTimeout> milliseconds, the server will close
           the connection.

       <registry:absoluteTimeout>:  The OPTIONAL element that contains
           the absolute timeout for a connection in milliseconds.  The
           absolute timeout represents the maximum duration in
           milliseconds that a connection can be established.  The
           server will close a connection that has been established for
           more than <registry:absoluteTimeout> milliseconds.
       <registry:commandTimeout>:  The OPTIONAL element that contains
           the command timeout for a connection in milliseconds.  The
           server will close a connection that has an active command
           that exceeds <registry:commandTimeout> milliseconds.
       <registry:transLimit>:  The OPTIONAL element that contains the
           maximum number of transactions that can be submitted on the
           connection per the "perMs" attribute milliseconds.  It is up
           to server policy what to do with the connection when the
           client exceeds the <registry:transLimit>.

   EPP provides five commands to transform objects: <create> to create
   an instance of an object, <delete> to delete an instance of an
   object, <renew> to extend the validity period of an object,
   <transfer> to manage object sponsorship changes, and <update> to
   change information associated with an object.

3.2.1.  EPP <create> Command

   The EPP <create> command provides a transform operation that allows a
   client to create a zone object.  In addition to the standard EPP
   command elements, the <create> command MUST contain a
   <registry:create> element that identifies the registry namespace.
   The <registry:create> element contains the following child elements:

   <registry:zone>:  Element that contains the full set of attributes
       for the zone to create as defined in Section 2.4.

   Example <create> command:

   C:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
   C:<epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0"
   C:  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">

   <registry:update> element that identifies the registry namespace.
   The <registry:update> element contains the following child elements:

   <registry:zone>:  One or more elements that contain the full set of
       attributes for the zones as defined in Section 2.4.  The update
       completely replaces the prior version of the zone.

   Example <update> command:

   C:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
   C:<epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
   C:  <command>
   C:    <update>
   C:      <registry:update
   C:        xmlns:registry="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:registry-0.1">
   C:        <registry:zone>
   C:          <registry:name>EXAMPLE</registry:name>
   C:          ...
   C:        </registry:zone>
   C:      </registry:update>
   C:    </update>
   C:    <clTRID>ABC-12345</clTRID>
   C:  </command>
   C:</epp>

   When an <update> command has been processed successfully, a server
   MUST respond with an EPP response with no <resData> element.

   Example <update> command:

   S:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
   S:<epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
   S:  <response>
   S:    <result code="1000">
   S:      <msg>Command completed successfully</msg>
   S:    </result>
   S:    <trID>
   S:      <clTRID>ABC-12345</clTRID>
   S:      <svTRID>54321-XYZ</svTRID>
   S:    </trID>
   S:  </response>
   S:</epp>

   An EPP error response MUST be returned if an <update> command can not
   be processed for any reason.

4.  Formal Syntax

   One schema is presented here that is the EPP Registry Mapping Schema.

   The formal syntax presented here is a complete schema representation
   of the object mapping suitable for automated validation of EPP XML
   instances.  The BEGIN and END tags are not part of the schema; they
   are used to note the beginning and ending of the schema for URI
   registration purposes.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  XML Namespace

   This document uses URNs to describe XML namespaces and XML schemas
   conforming to a registry mechanism described in [RFC3688].

   Registration request for the registry namespace:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:registry-0.1
      Registrant Contact: IESG
      XML: None.  Namespace URIs do not represent an XML specification.

   Registration request for the registry XML schema:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:registry-0.1
      Registrant Contact: IESG
      XML: See the "Formal Syntax" section of this document.

5.2.  EPP Extension Registry

   The EPP extension described in this document should be registered by
   the IANA in the EPP Extension Registry described in [RFC7451].  The
   details of the registration are as follows:

   Name of Extension: "Registry Mapping for the Extensible Provisioning
   Protocol (EPP)"

   Document status: Standards Track

   Reference: (insert reference to RFC version of this document)

   Registrant Name and Email Address: IESG, <iesg@ietf.org>

   TLDs: Any

   IPR Disclosure: TBD

   Status: Active

   Notes: None

6.  Implementation Status

   TBD

7.  Security Considerations

   The mapping extensions described in this document do not provide any
   security services beyond those described by EPP [RFC5730] and
   protocol layers used by EPP.  The security considerations described
   in these other specifications apply to this specification as well.

8.  Acknowledgements

   TBD
