 YANG Modules describing Capabilities for Systems and Datastore Update
                             Notifications
            draft-ietf-netconf-notification-capabilities-21

Abstract

   This document defines two YANG modules,"ietf-system-capabilities" and
   "ietf-notification-capabilities".

   The module "ietf-system-capabilities" provides a placeholder
   structure that can be used to discover YANG related system
   capabilities for servers.  The module can be used to report
   capability information from the server at run time or at
   implementation time, by making use of the YANG Instance Data File
   Format.

   The module "ietf-notification-capabilities" augments "ietf-system-
   capabilities" to specify capabilities related to Subscription to YANG
   Notifications for Datastore Updates.

1.  Introduction

   Servers and/or publishers often have capabilities, values describing
   operational behavior, that need to be conveyed to clients, which is
   enabled by the YANG modules described in this document.

   There is a need to publish this capability information as it is part
   of the API contract between the server and client.  Examples include
   maximum size of data that can be stored or transferred, information



Lengyel, et al.           Expires 18 April 2022                 [Page 2]

Internet-Draft    System and  Notification Capabilities     October 2021


   about counters (whether a node supports "on-change" telemetry), etc.
   Such capabilities are often dependent on a vendor's implementation or
   the available resources at deployment.  Many such capabilities are
   specific to the complete system, individual YANG datastores
   [RFC8342], specific parts of the YANG schema, or even individual data
   nodes.  It is a goal of this document to provide a common way of
   representing such capabilities in a format that is:

   *  vendor independent

   *  machine-readable

   *  available in an identical format both at implementation time and
      at run time.

   Implementation-time information is needed by Network Management
   System (NMS) implementers.  An NMS implementation that supports
   notifications needs the information about a system's capability so it
   can send "on-change" notifications.  If the information is not
   documented in a way that is readily available to the NMS designer,
   but only as instance data from the network node once it is deployed,
   the NMS implementation will be delayed, because it has to wait for
   the network node to be ready.  In addition, the assumption that all
   NMS implementers will have a correctly configured network node
   available to retrieve data from is an expensive proposition and may
   not always hold.  (An NMS may need to be able to handle many dozens
   of network node types.)  Often a fully functional NMS is a
   requirement for introducing a new network node type into a network,
   so delaying NMS readiness effectively also delays the time at which a
   new network node type can be introduced into the network.

   Implementation-time information is needed by system integrators.
   When introducing a network node type into their network, operators
   often need to integrate the node type into their own management
   system.  The NMS may have management functions that depend on "on-
   change" notifications.  The network operators need to plan their
   management practices and NMS implementation before they decide to buy
   the specific network node type.  Moreover, the decision to buy the
   node type sometimes depends on these management possibilities.

   Run-time capability information is needed:

   *  for any "purely model driven" application, e.g., a NETCONF-
      browser.  Such applications depend on reading models and
      capabilities at run time to support all the publisher's available
      functionality.

   *  in case the capability might change during run time e.g., due to
      licensing, HW constraints etc.

   *  to check that capability information provided earlier, at
      implementation time, is what the publisher has implemented.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The terms "YANG-Push", "on-change subscription" and "periodic
   subscription" are used as defined in [RFC8641].

   The terms "subscriber", "publisher" and "receiver" are used as
   defined in [RFC8639].

   The term "server" is used as defined in [RFC8342].

   The terms "YANG instance data file format", "instance data", and
   "instance data set" are used as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-instance-file-format].

   In addition, this document defines the following terms:

   "Implementation-time information": Information about the server's
   behavior that is made available during the implementation of the
   server, available from a source other than a running server.

   "Run-time information": Information about the server's behavior that
   is available from the running server via management protocols such as
   NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].

2.  Providing System Capability Information

   Capability information is represented by instance-data based on one
   or more "capability defining YANG modules".  This allows a user to
   discover capabilities both at implementation time and at run time.

   *  For the implementation-time use case: Capabilities SHOULD be
      provided by the implementer as YANG instance data files complying
      to [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-instance-file-format].  When provided,
      the file MUST be available already at implementation time,
      retrievable in a way that does not depend on a live network node.
      E.g., download from product website.

Internet-Draft    System and  Notification Capabilities     October 2021


   *  For the run-time use case: Capabilities SHOULD be available via
      NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040] from the live server
      (implementing the publisher) during run time.  Implementations
      that support changing these capabilities at run time SHOULD
      support "on-change" notifications about the system-capabilities
      container.

   The module "ietf-system-capabilities" provides a placeholder
   structure to be used to specify any YANG related system capability.

   The module "ietf-notification-capabilities" is defined to allow a
   publisher to specify capabilities related to "Subscription to YANG
   Notifications for Datastore Updates" [RFC8641], also known as YANG-
   Push, augmenting "ietf-system-capabilities".

   The YANG data models in this document conform to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in [RFC8342].

3.  Providing YANG-Push Notification Capabilities Information

   A specific case is the need to specify capabilities in the YANG-Push
   functionality.  As defined in [RFC8641] a publisher may allow
   subscribers to subscribe to updates from a datastore and will
   subsequently push such update notifications to the receiver.
   Notifications may be sent periodically or "on-change" (more or less
   immediately after each change).

   A publisher supporting YANG-Push has a number of capabilities defined
   in [RFC8641] that are often determined during the implementation of
   the publisher.  These include:

   *  Supported (reporting) periods for "periodic" subscriptions

   *  Maximum number of objects that can be sent in an update

   *  The set of datastores or data nodes for which "periodic"
      notification is supported.

   Additional capabilities if the optional "on-change" feature is
   supported include:

   *  Supported dampening periods for "on-change" subscriptions

   *  The set of datastores or data nodes for which "on-change"
      notification is supported

Internet-Draft    System and  Notification Capabilities     October 2021


   Publishers might have some capabilities (or limitations) to document.
   For example, how many update notifications and how many datastore
   node updates they can send out in a certain time-period.  Other
   publishers might not support "periodic" subscriptions to all
   datastores.  In some cases, a publisher supporting "on-change"
   notifications will not be able to push updates for some object types
   "on-change".  Reasons for this might be that the value of the
   datastore node changes frequently (e.g., in-octets counter), that
   small object changes are frequent and irrelevant to the receiver
   (e.g., a temperature gauge changing 0.1 degrees within a
   predetermined and acceptable range), or that the implementation is
   not capable of on-change notification for a particular object.  In
   all those cases, it will be important for subscriber applications to
   have a way to identify which objects "on-change" notifications are
   supported and for which ones not.

   Faced with the reality that support for "on-change" notification does
   not mean that such notifications will be sent for any specific data
   node, subscriber/management applications can not rely on the "on-
   change" functionality unless the subscriber has some means to
   identify which objects "on-change" notifications are supported for.
   YANG models are meant to be used as an interface contract.  Without
   identification of the data nodes actually supporting "on-change",
   this contract would be incomplete.

   Clients of a server (and subscribers to a publisher, as subscribers
   are also clients) need a method to gather capability information.

4.  System Capabilities Model

   The module "ietf-system-capabilities" is defined to provide a
   structure that can be used to discover (as read-only operational
   state) any YANG related system capability.

   This module itself does not contain any capabilities; it provides
   augmentation points for capabilities to be defined in subsequent YANG
   modules.  The ietf-system-capabilies is used by other modules to
   augment in specific capability information.  Every set of such
   capabilities MUST be wrapped in a container under the augment
   statement to cleanly separate different groups of capabilities.
   These "wrapper containers" SHALL be augmented in at /sysc:system-
   capabilities and /sysc:system-capabilities/sysc:datastore-
   capabilities/sysc:per-node-capabilities.

   Capability values can be specified on system level, datastore level
   (by selecting all nodes in the datastore) or for specific data nodes
   of a specific datastore (and their contained sub-trees).  Capability
   values specified for a specific datastore or node-set override values
   specified on the system level.

   Note: The solution is usable for both NMDA and non-NMDA systems.  For
   non-NMDA servers "config false" data is considered as if it were part
   of the running datastore.

6.  Security Considerations

   The YANG modules specified in this document define a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040] or as YANG instance data.
   The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer, and the
   mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH)
   [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-
   implement secure transport is TLS [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   This document outlines a framework for conveying system capability
   information that is inherently flexible and extensible.  While the
   full set of use cases is not known now, they may range as wide as
   conveying the minimum update period for periodic subscription updates
   and what protocols might be used for such notifications.  Knowledge
   of this type of value might, for example, allow an attacker to gain
   insight into how long unauthorized configuration changes might be



Lengyel, et al.           Expires 18 April 2022                [Page 18]

Internet-Draft    System and  Notification Capabilities     October 2021


   active prior to detection, and what communications channels might be
   disrupted to extend the period of non-detection.  Documents adding
   additional capabilities via augmenting this module are encouraged to
   document the security considerations of the new YANG nodes, according
   to the guidance in BCP 216.

   All protocol-accessible data nodes in augmented modules are read-only
   and cannot be modified.  The data in these modules is not security
   sensitive.  Access control may be configured, to avoid exposing the
   read-only data.

   When that data is in file format, data should be protected against
   modification or unauthorized access using normal file handling
   mechanisms.  The data in file format also inherits all the security
   considerations of [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-instance-file-format] which
   has additional considerations about read protections; and
   distinguishes between data at rest and in motion.

Appendix A.  Instance data example #1

   The following examples use artwork folding [RFC8792] for better
   formatting.

   The following instance data example describes the notification
   capabilities of a hypothetical "acme-router".  The router implements
   the running and operational datastores.  Every change can be reported
   "on-change" from the running datastore, but only "config false" nodes
   and some "config false" data from the operational datastore.
   Interface statistics are not reported "on-change", only two important
   counters.  Datastore subscription capabilities are not reported "on-
   change", as they never change on the acme-router during run time.

Appendix B.  Instance data example #2

   The following examples use artwork folding [RFC8792] for better
   formatting.

   The following instance data example describes the notification
   capabilities of a hypothetical "acme-switch".  The switch implements
   the running, candidate and operational datastores.  Every change can
   be reported "on-change" from the running datastore, nothing from the
   candidate datastore and all "config false" data from the operational
   datastore.  "periodic" subscriptions are supported for running and
   operational, but not for candidate datastores.

   *  Updated to follow draft-ietf-netmod-yang-instance-file-format-10

   *  Various editing changes

   v11 - v12

   *  Updated max-nodes-per-update description

   *  Reformatted YANG models with pyang -f yang --keep-comments --yang-
      line-length 69

   v10 - v11

   *  Updated examples

   *  Updated typedef notification-support

   v09 - v10

   *  Removed description text from imports about the need for
      implementing the imported module.

   *  Changed notification-support to bits with shorter names

   *  Assigned enum values to supported-excluded-change-type

   *  Made node-selector a choice to allow for future alternative
      selection methods.

   *  Changed precedence of per-node-capabilities entries.  Precedence
      is now according to the position of entries in the list.

   v08 - v09

   *  Split the YANG module into two: ietf-system-capabilities and ietf-
      notification-capabilities.  Restructured/updated the draft
      accordingly.

   v07 - v08

   *  Prepared the YANG model to include other non-YANG-Push related
      capabilities.

   *  Renamed the top level container to system-capabilities

   *  Added a container subscription-capabilities to the grouping
      subscription-capabilities to contain all subscription related
      capabilities

   *  Updated examples according to draft-ietf-netmod-yang-instance-
      file-format-06.

   v06 - v07

   *  Updated examples according to draft-ietf-netmod-yang-instance-
      file-format-05.

   v05 - v06

   *  Providing the capability data is only a "SHOULD" recommendation.
      Some reviewers wanted MUST some wanted much less.

   *  The YANG module import statements now indicate the imported
      modules that must be implemented not just available as import as
      requested by the YangDoctors review.

   v04 - v05

   *  Added new capabilities periodic-notifications-supported and
      supported-excluded-change-type.

   *  Restructured YANG module to make the node-selector's usage similar
      to how NACM uses it: "/" means the whole datastore.

   *  Small corrections, spelling, rewording

   *  Replaced the term server with the term publisher except in cases
      where we speak about datastores and functionality based on get,
      getconfig operations.  In this latter case it is really the server
      functionality that is discussed.

   v03 - v04

   *  Clarified recommended support for on-change notifications about
      the datastore-subscription-capabilities.

   v02 - v03

   *  Allow throughput related capabilities to be defined on top,
      datastore or data node level.  Described that specific capability
      values always override generic ones.

   *  Indicate that non-NMDA servers can also use this model.

   *  Updated according to draft-ietf-netmod-yang-instance-file-
      format-04
