   2 Terminology 
      
     An end-to-end virtual circuit in a L2 VPN consists of a 3 segment 
     set: <AC, PW, AC> [L2VPN-FRMK]. Note that the AC does not need to 
    
  Aissaoui, et al.          Expires March 2006                  [Page 3]

     connect a CE directly to a PE. An intermediate L2 network may 
     exist. 
      
     A L2 VPN circuit is homogeneous if AC and PW types are the same. 
     E.g., ATM circuit: <ATM AC, ATM PW, ATM AC>. 
      
     A L2 VPN circuit is heterogeneous if any two segments of the 
     circuit are of different types. E.g., IP interworking circuit: 
     <ATM AC, IP PW, ATM AC>, or <ATM AC, IP PW, FR AC>. 
      
     The PW of a L2 VPN circuit can ride over three types of Packet 
     Switched Network (PSN). A PSN which makes use of LSPs as the 
     tunneling technology to forward the PW packets will be referred to 
     as a MPLS PSN. A PSN which makes use of MPLS-in-IP tunneling 
     [MPLS-in-IP], with a MPLS shim header used as PW demultiplexer, 
     will be referred to as MPLS-IP PSN. A PSN, which makes use of 
     L2TPv3 [L2TPv3] as the tunneling technology, will be referred to 
     as L2TP-IP PSN. 
      
     A PE interworks or adapts an AC onto a PW (depending on whether it 
     terminates the attachment circuit or the AC corresponds to the NS 
     for the PW). The other PE that terminates the PW is the "peer" PE 
     and the attachment circuit associated with the far end PW 
     termination is the "remote AC".  
      
     Defects are discussed in the context of defect states, and the 
     criteria to enter and exit the defect state. 
      
     The direction of defects is discussed from the perspective of the 
     observing PE and what the PE may explicitly know about information 
     transfer capabilities of the VPWS service. 
      
     A forward defect is one that impacts information transfer to the 
     observing PE. It impacts the observing PEÆs ability to receive 
     information. A forward defect MAY also imply impact on information 
     sent or relayed by the observer (and as it cannot receive is 
     therefore unknowable) and so the forward defect state is 
     considered to be a superset of the two defect states. 
      
     A reverse defect is one that uniquely impacts information sent or 
     relayed by observer.  
      
     At the present time code points for forward defect and reverse 
     defect notifications have not been specified for BFD and LDP PW 
     Status signaling. These are referred to as "forward defect" and 
     "reverse defect" indications as placeholders for code point 
     assignment. A crude mapping may be performed between current code 
     points in [PWE3-IANA]: 
      
          Forward defect - corresponds to the logical OR of 
                  Local Attachment Circuit (ingress) Receive Fault 
                                  AND 
                  Local PSN-facing PW (egress) Transmit Fault

   3 Introduction 
      
     This draft augments OAM message mapping [OAM-MSG] with OAM 
     procedures for scenarios when the attachment circuit does not 
     correspond to the pseudo wire. When combined with procedures 
     defined in [OAM-MSG], comprehensive OAM interworking can be 
     defined for VPWS services. VPWS services are defined in the L2 VPN 
     framework [L2VPN-FRMK]. 
      
     The following VPWS types are covered in this document: 
      
     1. VPWS with heterogeneous ACs of ATM and FR types, and in which 
        the PW type is ATM or FR. In this case, FR-ATM service 
        interworking [FRF8.2] is performed in PE1 (or PE2) and a FR (or 
        ATM) PW is extended to the remote PE. This VPWS type will be 
        referred to as "FR-ATM Interworking VPWS". 
   
     2. VPWS with heterogeneous ACs of ATM, FR, and Ethernet types, and 
        in which the PW type is Ethernet. This VPWS type will be 
        referred to as "Ethernet Interworking VPWS". 
   
     3. VPWS with heterogeneous ACs of ATM, FR, and Ethernet types, and 
        in which the PW type is IP [ARP-Mediation]. This VPWS type will 
        be referred to as "IP Interworking VPWS". 
      
     OAM procedures for homogeneous VPWS circuits of ATM, FR, or 
     Ethernet types are described in [OAM-MSG]. 
   
   4 General OAM Procedures 

   4.1 Defect Locations 
      
     Figure 1 illustrates a VPWS network model with an indication of 
     the possible defect locations. This model will be referenced in 
     the remainder of this document for describing the OAM procedures.

     In all interworking scenarios described in this document, it is 
     assumed that at PE1 the AC does not correspond to the PW. The 
     procedures described in this document exclusively apply to PE1.  
     PE2 either implements the procedures described in this document or 
     those in [OAM-MSG]. The notifications received from PE2 and 
     consequent actions taken at PE1 will be common to both scenarios. 
      
     The following is a brief description of the defect locations: 
      
     (a)  Defect in the first L2 network (N1). This covers any defect 
          in the N1 which impacts all or a subset of ACs terminating in 
          PE1. The defect is conveyed to PE1 and to the remote L2 
          network (N2) using a L2 specific OAM defect indication.  
     (b)  Defect on a PE1 AC interface. 
     (c)  Defect on a PE PSN interface. 
     (d)  Defect in the PSN network. This covers any defect in the PSN 
          which impacts all or a subset of the PSN tunnels and PWs 
          terminating in a PE. The defect is conveyed to the PE using a 
          PSN and/or a PW specific OAM defect indication. 
     (e)  Defect in the second L2 network (N2). This covers any defect 
          in N2 which impacts all or a subset of ACs terminating in PE2 
          (which is considered a "remote AC defect" in the context of 
          procedures outlined in this draft). The defect is conveyed to 
          PE2 and to the remote L2 network (N1) using a L2 specific OAM 
          defect indication.  
     (f)  Defect on a PE2 AC interface (which is also considered a 
          "remote AC defect" in the context of this draft). 

   4.2 Abstract Defect States 
     PE1 is obliged to track four abstract defect states that reflect 
     the observed state of both directions of the VPWS service on both 
     the AC and the PW sides. Faults may impact only one or both 
     directions of the PW.  
      
     The observed state is a combination of faults directly detected by 
     PE1, or faults it has been made aware of via notifications. 
      
                                +-----+

               Figure 2: Forward and Reverse Defect States 
     PE1 will directly detect or be notified of AC forward and PW 
     forward defects as they occur upstream of PE1 and impact traffic 
     being sent to PE1.  
     In Error! Reference source not found., PE1 may be notified of a 
     forward defect in the AC by receiving a Forward Defect indication, 
     e.g., ATM AIS, from CE1. This defect impacts the ability of PE1 to 
     receive user traffic from CE1 on the AC. PE1 can also directly 
     detect this defect if it resulted from a failure of the receive 
     side in the local port or link over which the AC is configured.  
     Similarly, PE1 may detect or be notified of a forward defect in 
     the PW by receiving a Forward Defect indication from PE2. This 
     notification can either be a "Local PSN-facing PW (egress) 
     Transmit Fault" or a "Local Attachment Circuit (ingress) Receive 
     Fault". This defect impacts the ability of PE1 to receive user 
     traffic from CE2.  
     Note that the AC or PW Forward Defect notification is sent in the 
     same direction as the user traffic impacted by the defect. 
      
     PE1 will only be notified of AC reverse and PW reverse defects as 
     they universally will be detected by other devices and only impact 
     traffic that has already been relayed by PE1. In Error! Reference 
     source not found., PE1 may be notified of a reverse defect in the 
     AC by receiving a Reverse Defect indication, e.g., ATM RDI, from 
     CE1. This defect impacts the ability of PE1 to send user traffic 
     to CE1 on the AC. Similarly, PE1 may be notified of a reverse 
     defect in the PW by receiving a Reverse Defect indication from 
     PE2. This notification can either be a "Local PSN-facing PW 
     (ingress) Receive Fault" or a "Local Attachment Circuit (egress) 
     Transmit Fault". This defect impacts the ability of PE1 to send 
     user traffic to CE2. 
     Note that the AC or PW Reverse Defect notification is sent in the 
     reverse direction to the user traffic impacted by the defect. 
      
     The procedures outlined in this document define the entry and exit 
     criteria for each of the four states with respect to the set of 
     potential ACs and PWs within the document scope and the consequent 
     actions that PE1 must perform to properly interwork those 
     notifications. The abstract defect states used by PE1 are common 
     to all potential interworking combinations of PWs and ACs. 

   4.3 VPWS OAM Interworking Models 
      
     There are two different OAM interworking models which are dictated 
     by the type of VPWS.  
      
     In a homogeneous VPWS circuit, the AC link layer is emulated by 
     the PW by extending it across the PSN. This has the implication 
     that the native service OAM has to operate transparently across 
     the PSN. In this case, the default OAM procedures are to use the 
     native service OAM for both the AC and PW defect indications. This

  Internet Draft draft-aissaoui-l2vpn-vpws-iw-oam-03.txt September 2005 
   
     model is referred to as the homogeneous VPWS circuit OAM model. An 
     example of this is ATM VPWS OAM procedures. Some homogenous 
     scenarios use PW OAM mechanisms to synchronize VPWS state between 
     PEs due to discontinuities in native service OAM between the AC 
     and the PW (e.g. FR LMI), or lack of native service OAM (e.g. 
     Ethernet). Detailed OAM procedures for the homogeneous VPWS 
     circuit types are described in [OAM-MSG].   
      
     In a heterogeneous VPWS circuit, the AC link layer is terminated 
     at a PE. Therefore, the native service OAM always terminates at 
     the AC endpoint in the PE. In this case, the default OAM 
     procedures are to terminate the native service OAM and to convey 
     the corresponding defect state using a PW specific defect 
     mechanism. This model is referred to as the heterogeneous VPWS 
     circuit OAM model and is the model suitable for the VPWS types 
     covered in this document.  
      
     For a MPLS PSN and a IP PSN using MPLS-in-IP (MPLS-IP PSN), PW 
     status signaling messages are used as the default mechanism for AC 
     and PW status and defect notification [PWE3-CONTROL]. If the PEs 
     have negotiated the use of VCCV-BFD for PW fault detection and 
     AC/PW fault notifications as explained in [VCCV] then BFD is the 
     preferred mechanism. The interaction of BFD and PW status is 
     explained in more details in Section 4.5. 
      
     For a IP PSN using L2TPv3, i.e., a L2TP-IP PSN, StopCCN and CDN 
     messages are used for conveying defects in the PSN and PW 
     respectively, while the Set-Link-Info (SLI) messages are used to 
     convey status and defects in the AC and local L2 network as 
     detailed in [OAM-MSG].  
      
     Finally, it may be desirable to operate ATM OAM inband in the case 
     of the FR-ATM interworking VPWS. This document proposes to use the 
     homogeneous OAM circuit model together with an ATM cell mode PW to 
     achieve this. 
      
     Table 1 summarizes the OAM model used with each type of VPWS 
     covered in this document.

                 Table 1: Summary of VPWS OAM Interworking 

   4.4 PW Status Notifications 
      
     PW status signaling is the default mechanism for conveying the 
     status of a PW and ACs between PEs in a MPLS PSN and a IP PSN 
     using MPLS-in-IP (MPLS-IP PSN). 
      
     [PWE3-IANA] defines the following valid PW status codepoints: 
     0x00000000 - Pseudo Wire forwarding (clear all failures) 
     0x00000001 - Pseudo Wire Not Forwarding 
     0x00000002 - Local Attachment Circuit (ingress) Receive Fault 
     0x00000004 - Local Attachment Circuit (egress) Transmit Fault 
     0x00000008 - Local PSN-facing PW (ingress) Receive Fault 
     0x00000010 - Local PSN-facing PW (egress) Transmit Fault 
      
     [PWE3-CONTROL] specifies that "Pseudo Wire forwarding" is used to 
     clear all faults and that "Pseudo Wire Not Forwarding" is used to 
     convey any other defects that cannot be represented by the other 
     codepoints. The remaining codepoints map to the "forward defect" 
     and "reverse defect" defined in this document as follows:
      
          Forward defect - corresponds to the logical OR of 
                  Local Attachment Circuit (ingress) Receive Fault 
                                  AND 
                  Local PSN-facing PW (egress) Transmit Fault 
      
          Reverse defect - corresponds to the logical OR of 
                  Local Attachment Circuit (egress) Transmit Fault 
                                  AND  
                  Local PSN-facing PW (ingress) Receive Fault 
      
     Note that there are a couple of situations which require PW label 
     withdrawal as opposed to a PW status notification by the PE. The 
     first one is when the PW is taken administratively down in 
     accordance to [PWE3-CONTROL]. The second one is when the Target 
     LDP session established between the two PEÆs is lost. In the 
     latter case, the PW labels will need to be re-signaled when the 
     Targeted LDP session is re-established. 

   4.5 L2TPv3 Control Connection Messages 
      
     For a L2TP-IP PSN, StopCCN and CDN messages are used for conveying 
     defects which impact one or many PWs controlled by a given control 
     connection.  
      
     A StopCCN message indicates that the control connection has been 
     shut down by the remote PE [L2TPv3]. This is typically used for 
     defects in the PSN which impact both the control connection and 
     the individual data plane sessions. On reception of this message, 
     a PE closes the control connection and will clear all the sessions 
    
  Aissaoui, et al.          Expires March 2006                  [Page 9]  
   
  Internet Draft draft-aissaoui-l2vpn-vpws-iw-oam-03.txt September 2005 
   
     managed by this control connection. Since each session carries a 
     single PW, the state of the corresponding PWs is changed to DOWN. 
     A CDN message indicates that the remote peer requests the 
     disconnection of a specific session [L2TPv3]. In this case only 
     the state of the corresponding PW is changed to DOWN. This is 
     typically used for local defects in a PE which impact only a 
     specific session and the corresponding PW. 
      
     Finally, the Set-Link-Info (SLI) messages are used to convey 
     status and defects in the AC and local L2 network 

   4.6 BFD Fault Detection and Notification 
      
     BFD is a mechanism which can be used to detect defects in the PW 
     data path. This document specifies two uses of BFD. When used for 
     PW fault detection only, a PE will continue to use PW status to 
     report defects other than those detected by BFD. When used for 
     both PW fault detection and all PW/AC fault notifications, PW 
     status should not be used. This section describes the behavior of 
     the PE nodes in both use cases. 
      
     For a MPLS-PSN, the PEÆs negotiate the use of the VCCV 
     capabilities when the label mapping messages are exchanged to 
     establish the two directions of the PW. A new OAM capability TLV 
     is signaled as part of the PW FEC interface parameters TLV.  
      
     The CV Type Indicators field in this TLV defines a bitmask used to 
     indicate the specific OAM capabilities that the PE can make use of 
     over the PW being established. The defined values are: 
          0x01  ICMP Ping 
          0x02  LSP Ping (VCCV-Ping over a MPLS PSN and MPLS-IP PSN) 
          0x04  BFD for PW Fault Detection only 
          0x08  BFD for PW Fault Detection and AC/PW Fault Notification 
      
     A CV type of 0x04 is part of the VCCV-BFD capability. It indicates 
     that BFD is used for PW fault detection only. A BFD message will 
     notify the remote PE of the fault and the latter enters into the 
     proper PW defect state and triggers the appropriate actions as 
     explained in the subsequent sections. All other PW and AC defects 
     are indicated using PW status signaling. 
      
     A CV type of 0x08 is also part of the VCCV-BFD capability. It 
     indicates that BFD is used for both PW fault detection and AC/PW 
     Fault Notification, even if the fault was not detected via BFD. In 
     this case, PW status signaling messages should not be used. 
      
     Similarly, [VCCV] describes a L2TPv3 VCCV Capability AVP which 
     provides the equivalent means to signal OAM capabilities between 
     PEÆs for PWÆs over a L2TP-IP PSN.  
      
     [BFD] defined the following diagnostic codes:

     [VCCV] states that, when used over PWs, the asynchronous mode of 
     BFD should be used. Of these, 0 is used when the PW is up and 2 is 
     not applicable to asynchronous mode. 3 is used as explained below. 
     6 and 8 are used to signal AC forward and reverse defect states 
     respectively when the PE's negotiated the use of BFD as the 
     mechanism for AC and PW fault detection and notification. 
          
     The following are the BFD procedures for PW fault detection (valid 
     for both CV types 0x04 and 0x08):  
          
     When the downstream PE (PE1) does not receive control messages 
     from the upstream PE (PE2) during a certain number of transmission 
     intervals (a number provisioned by the operator), it declares that 
     the PW in its receive direction is down. In other word, PE1 enters 
     the "forward defect" state for this PW. PE1 sends a message to PE2 
     with H=0 (i.e. "I do not hear you") and with diagnostic code 1. In 
     turn, PE2 declares the PW is down in its transmit direction and it 
     uses diagnostic code 3 in its control messages to PE1. PE2 enters 
     the "reverse defect" state for this PW.  
       
     When a PW is taken administratively down, the PEs will withdraw 
     the PW labels or will send L2TP CDN messages with code "Session 
     disconnected for administrative reasons". In addition, exchange of 
     BFD control messages MUST be suspended. To that end, the PEs MUST 
     send control messages with H=0 and diagnostic code 7 
      
   5 PW Entry/Exit Criteria 

   5.1.1 PW Forward Defect Entry 
      
     PE1 enters the forward defect state if any of the following 
     conditions are met: 
      
     (i)    It detects or is notified of a defect upstream of PE1 in 
             the PSN tunnel over which the PW is riding.  
   
             Defects detected explicitly include the loss of 
             connectivity, label swapping errors and label merging 
             errors. In the case of a MPLS PSN and a MPLS-IP PSN, these 
    
  Aissaoui, et al.          Expires March 2006                 [Page 11]  
   
  Internet Draft draft-aissaoui-l2vpn-vpws-iw-oam-03.txt September 2005 
   
             defects can be detected by running a MPLS specific 
             connectivity verification mechanism such as LSP-Ping [LSP-
             Ping], BFD on a LSP [LSP-BFD] or Y.1711 CV [Y.1711]. The 
             assumption is that deployed PSN resiliency mechanisms have 
             not been sufficient to recover from the defect and restore 
             connectivity to the peer PE. 
              
             Notifications of defects remote from the PE include Y.1711 
             FDI/BDI, BFD and RSVP-TE PathErr message. 
   
     (ii)   It receives a message from the remote PE indicating a 
             forward defect. In the case of a MPLS PSN and a MPLS-IP 
             PSN, this is a PW status message [PWE3-CONTROL] or BFD 
             diagnostic code indicating a "Forward defect", or "PW not 
             forwarding". 
   
     (iii)  It detects a loss of PW connectivity, including label 
             errors, via an inband PW OAM connectivity verification, 
             such as VCCV. 
      
     Note that if the PW control session between the PEs fails, the PW 
     is torn down and needs to be re-established. However, the 
     consequent actions towards the ACs are the same as if the PW state 
     were DOWN.   

   5.1.2 PW Reverse Defect Entry 
     For PWE3 over a MPLS PSN and a MPLS-IP PSN, PE1 enters the PW 
     reverse defect state when the following conditions are true:  
          
     (i)    The status communicated by PE2 via BFD or LDP status TLV 
             indicates a reverse defect. This indicates PE2 detected or 
             was notified of a PW/PSN fault upstream of it or that 
             there was a remote AC fault and it is not already in the 
             PW forward defect state. 
          
     For a PWE3 over a L2TP-IP PSN, the PW reverse defect state is not 
     valid and a PE can only enter the PW forward defect state. 

   5.1.3 PW reverse defects that require PE state synchronization 
     Some PW mechanisms will result in PW defects being detected by or 
     notified to PE1 when PE1 is upstream of the fault but the 
     notification did not originate with PE2. The resultant actions are 
     identical to that of entering the PW reverse defect state with the 
     addition that PE1 needs to synchronize state with PE2 and the PW 
     state communicated from PE1 to PE2 needs to indicate state 
     accordingly. 
       
     When the PSN uses RSVP-TE or proactively uses LSP-PING as a PW 
     fault detection mechanism, PE1 must enter the AC forward defect.

     The exit criteria being when, the RSVP fault state or the LSP-PING 
     fault state exit criteria has been met, indicating no PW reverse 
     defects.   

   5.1.4 PW Forward Defect Exit 
     For PWE3 over a MPLS PSN and a MPLS-IP PSN, PE1 exits the PW 
     Forward state when the following conditions are true:  
          
     (ii)   The status communicated by PE2 via BFD or LDP status TLV 
             no longer indicates a forward defect AND 
     Local indications (BFD processing etc.) indicate that PW and PSN 
     connectivity is working in the forward direction. Note that this 
     may result in a transition to the PW working or PW reverse defect 
     states. 
          
     For a PWE3 over a L2TP-IP, a PE exits the PW DOWN state when the 
     following conditions are true: 
      
     (i)    All defects it had previously detected have disappeared, 
             and  
     (ii)   A L2TPv3 session is successfully established to carry the 
             PW packets. 

   5.1.5 PW Reverse Defect Exit 
     For PWE3 over a MPLS PSN and a MPLS-IP PSN, PE1 exits the PW 
     Reverse defect state when the following conditions are true:  
          
     (i)    The status communicated by PE2 via BFD or LDP status TLV 
             no longer indicates a reverse defect or, 
     (ii)   PE1 has entered the PW forward defect state. 
   
    
   6 AC Defect Entry/Exit Criteria  

   6.1 ATM AC Defect Entry/Exit Criteria 

   6.1.1 Forward Defect Entry 
     PE1 enters the AC forward defect state if any of the following 
     conditions are met: 
      
     (i)    It detects a physical layer alarm on the ATM interface. 
     (ii)   It receives an F5 AIS OAM cell indicating that the ATM 
             VP/VC is down in the adjacent L2 ATM network (e.g., N1 for 
             PE1). 
     (iii)  It detects loss of connectivity on the ATM VPC/VCC while 
             running ATM continuity checking (ATM CC) with the local 
             ATM network and CE. 
      
     Note that all interworking VPWS referred to in this document make 
     use of ATM VCCs as the AC. ATM VPC cannot be terminated directly 

    
  Aissaoui, et al.          Expires March 2006                 [Page 13]  
   
  Internet Draft draft-aissaoui-l2vpn-vpws-iw-oam-03.txt September 2005 
   
     on an interworking VPWS. Therefore only F5 OAM messages are 
     relevant. 

   6.1.2 Forward Defect Exit 
     PE1 exits the AC forward defect state when all defects it had 
     previously detected have disappeared. The exact conditions under 
     which a PE exits AIS or declares that connectivity is restored via 
     ATM CC are explained in I.610 [I.610]. Note that it is possible to 
     transition directly from the forward to the reverse defect states. 

   6.1.3 Reverse Defect Entry 
     PE1 enters the AC reverse defect state if: 
      
     (i)    It terminates the ATM layer and it receives an F5 RDI OAM 
             cell indicating that the ATM VP/VC is down in the adjacent 
             L2 ATM network (e.g., N1 for PE1). 

   6.1.4 Reverse Defect Exit 
     PE1 exits the AC reverse defect state if: 
      
        (i)    It enters the forward defect state OR 
      
        (ii)   All defects it had previously detected have 
                disappeared. The exact conditions under which a PE 
                exits the RDI state are explained in I.610 [I.610]. 

   6.2 FR AC Defect Entry/Exit 
     Note that the FR AC "inactive" state, as communicated by the FR 
     LMI, does not indicate direction but is assumed to be the 
     equivalent of a forward defect and is translated to same. The 
     reverse defect state is not valid for an FR AC. 

   6.2.1 Forward Defect Entry Criteria 
     PE1 enters the AC forward defect state if any of the following 
     conditions are met: 
      
     (i)    A PVC is not ædeletedÆ from the Frame Relay network and 
             the Frame Relay network explicitly indicates in a full 
             status report (and optionally by the asynchronous status 
             message) that this Frame Relay PVC is æinactiveÆ. In this 
             case, this status maps across the PE to the corresponding 
             PW only. 
     (ii)   The LIV indicates that the link from the PE to the Frame 
             Relay network is down. In this case, the link down 
             indication maps across the PE to all corresponding PWs. 
     (iii)  A physical layer alarm is detected on the FR interface. In 
             this case, this status maps across the PE to all 
             corresponding PWs.

   6.2.2 Forward Defect Exit Criteria 
     A PE exits the FR AC Down state when all defects it had previously 
     detected have disappeared. 

   6.3 Ethernet AC Defect Entry/Exit Criteria 
     Ethernet AC failures are translated directly into AC forward 
     defects. The reverse defect state is not valid for Ethernet ACs.  

   6.3.1 Forward Defect State Entry 
     PE1 enters the AC forward defect state if any of the following 
     conditions are met: 
      
     (i)    A physical layer alarm is detected on the Ethernet 
             interface. 

   6.3.2 Forward Defect State Exit 
     A PE exits the Ethernet AC Down state when all defects it had 
     previously detected have disappeared. 
      
   7 AC Defect Entry/Exit Procedures 

   7.1 AC Forward defect entry: 
     On entry to the forward defect state, PE1 may need to perform 
     procedures on both the PW and the AC. 

   7.1.1 Procedures for FR, ATM AAL5, IP or Ethernet PWs 
     On entry to the AC forward defect state, PE1 notifies PE2 of a 
     forward defect: 
      
     For PW over MPLS PSN or MPLS-IP PSN 
     (i)    A PW Status message indicating "forward defect", or  
     (ii)   A VCCV-BFD diagnostic code of "forward defect" if the 
             optional use of VCCV-BFD notification has been negotiated. 
      
     For PW over L2TP-IP PSN 
     (i)    An L2TP Set-Link Info (LSI) message with a Circuit Status 
             AVP indicating "inactive", or  
     (ii)   A VCCV-BFD diagnostic code of "forward defect" if the 
             optional use of VCCV-BFD notification has been negotiated. 

   7.1.2 Procedures for ATM cell PWs 
     On entry to the AC forward defect state, PE1 MUST:  
          a. Commence insertion of ATM AIS cells into the corresponding 
             PW. 
          b. If PE1 is originating F5 I.610 CC cells, PE1 will suspend 
             CC generation for the duration of the defect state.

   7.1.3 Additional procedures for ATM ACs 
     On entry to the AC forward defect state PE1 will commence RDI 
     insertion into the AC as per I.610. 

  7.2 AC Reverse defect entry  

   7.2.1 Procedures for FR, ATM AAL5, IP or Ethernet PWs 
     On entry to the AC reverse defect state, PE1 notifies PE2 of a 
     reverse defect: 
      
     For PW over MPLS PSN or MPLS-IP PSN 
     (iii)  A PW Status message indicating "reverse defect", or  
     (iv)   A VCCV-BFD diagnostic code of "reverse defect" if the 
             optional use of VCCV-BFD notification has been 
             negotiated.. 
      
     For PW over L2TP-IP PSN 
     (iii)  An L2TP Set-Link Info (LSI) message with a Circuit Status 
             AVP indicating "inactive", or  
     (iv)   A VCCV-BFD diagnostic code of "reverse defect" if the 
             optional use of VCCV-BFD notification has been negotiated. 

   7.2.2 Procedures for ATM cell PWs 
     ATM AC would be the only potential source of AC reverse defect 
     state within the scope of this document. However, There are no 
     procedures in this case as the AC reverse defect state is not 
     valid for PE1 with a ATM AC and a ATM cell mode PW. 

   7.3 AC Forward Defect Exit 

   7.3.1 Procedures for FR, ATM AAL5, IP or Ethernet PWs 
      
     On exit from the AC forward defect state PE1 notifies PE2 that the 
     forward defect state has cleared (note that this may be a direct 
     state transition to either the working state or the reverse defect 
     state): 
      
     For PW over MPLS PSN or MPLS-IP PSN 
     (i)    A PW Status message with forward defect clear and the 
             remaining indicators showing either working or reverse 
             defect state, or 
     (ii)   A VCCV-BFD diagnostic code with the same attributes as (i) 
             if the optional use of VCCV-BFD notification has been 
             negotiated. 
      
     For PW over L2TP-IP PSN 
     (i)    An L2TP Set-Link Info (LSI) message with a Circuit Status 
             AVP indicating "active", or

  Internet Draft draft-aissaoui-l2vpn-vpws-iw-oam-03.txt September 2005 
   
     (ii)   A VCCV-BFD diagnostic code with the same attributes as (i) 
             if the optional use of VCCV-BFD notification has been 
             negotiated. 

   7.3.2 Procedures for ATM cell PWs 
     On exit from the AC forward defect state, PE1 MUST:  
     (i)    Cease insertion of ATM AIS cells into the corresponding 
             PW. 
     (ii)   If PE1 is originating F5 I.610 CC cells, PE1 will resume 
             CC generation for the duration of the defect state. 
      
     If the transition is to the AC reverse defect state, the 
     corresponding procedures apply. 

   7.3.3 Additional procedures for ATM ACs 
     On exit from the AC forward defect state PE1 will cease RDI 
     insertion into the AC as per I.610. 

   7.4 AC Reverse Defect Exit 

   7.4.1 Procedures for FR, ATM AAL5, IP or Ethernet PWs 
     On exit from the AC reverse defect state, PE1 notifies PE2 that 
     the reverse defect state has cleared (note that this may be a 
     direct state transition to either the working state or the forward 
     defect state). Depending on the negotiated notification mechanism 
     this will be one of: 
      
     For PW over MPLS PSN or MPLS-IP PSN 
     (i)    A PW Status message with the "reverse defect" indicator 
             cleared and the remaining indicators showing either 
             working or a transition to the "forward defect" state, or 
     (ii)   A VCCV-BFD diagnostic code with the same information as 
             (i) if the optional use of VCCV-BFD notification has been 
             negotiated. 
      
     For PW over L2TP-IP PSN 
     (i)    An L2TP Set-Link Info (LSI) message with a Circuit Status 
             AVP indicating "active", or 
     (ii)   A VCCV-BFD diagnostic code with the same information as 
             (i) if the optional use of VCCV-BFD notification has been 
             negotiated.

   8 PW Forward Defect Entry/Exit procedures 

   8.1 PW Forward Defect Entry Procedures 

   8.1.1 FR AC procedures  
     These procedures are applicable only if the transition from the 
     working state to the PW Forward defect state. A transition from PW 
     reverse defect state to the forward defect state does not require 
     any additional notification procedures to the FR AC as it has 
     already been told the peer is down. 
     (i)    PE1 MUST generate a full status report with the Active bit 
             = 0 (and optionally in the asynchronous status message), 
             as per Q.933 annex A, into N1 for the corresponding FR 
             ACs. 

   8.1.2 Ethernet AC Procedures 
     No procedures are currently defined. 

   8.1.3 ATM AC procedures 
     On entry to the PW Forward Defect State 
     (i)    PE1 MUST commence F5 AIS insertion into the corresponding 
             AC. 
     (ii)   PE1 MUST terminate any F5 CC generation on the 
             corresponding AC. 

   8.1.4 Additional procedures for FR, ATM AAL5, IP or Ethernet PWs 
     If the PW failure was explicitly detected by PE1, it MUST assume 
     PE2 has no knowledge of the defect and MUST notify PE2 in the form 
     of a reverse defect notification: 
      
     For PW over MPLS PSN or MPLS-IP PSN 
     (i)    A PW Status message indicating a "reverse defect", or 
     (ii)   A VCCV-BFD diagnostic code indicating a "reverse defect" 
             if the optional use of VCCV-BFD notification has been 
             negotiated. 
      
     For PW over L2TP-IP PSN 
      
     (i)    An L2TP Set-Link Info (LSI) message with a Circuit Status 
             AVP indicating "active", or  
     (ii)   A VCCV-BFD diagnostic code with the same attribute as (i) 
             if the optional use of VCCV-BFD notification has been 
             negotiated. 
      
     Otherwise the entry to the defect state was the result of a 
     notification from PE2 (indicating that PE2 already had knowledge 
     of the fault) or loss of the control adjacency (similarly visible 
     to PE2).

   8.1.5 Additional procedures for ATM Cell PWs 
     If the PW failure was explicitly detected, by PE1 by entering to 
     the ATM AIS state or loss of CC, PE1 MUST also commence RDI 
     insertion into the reverse direction of the PW. 

   8.2 PW Forward Defect Exit Procedures

     PE2 in the form of clearing the reverse defect notification: 
      
     For PW over MPLS PSN or MPLS-IP PSN 
     (i)    A PW Status message with the "reverse defect" indication 
             clear, and the remaining indicators showing either working 
             or a transition to the "forward defect" state, or 
     (ii)   A VCCV-BFD diagnostic code with the same attribute as in 
             (i) if the optional use of VCCV-BFD notification has been 
             negotiated. 
      
     For PW over L2TP-IP PSN 
     (i)    An L2TP Set-Link Info (LSI) message with a Circuit Status

   9 Security Considerations 
      
     This draft does not introduce any new security considerations to 
     VPWS. Though, it is worth mentioning that in the heterogeneous 
     VPWS OAM model, a flooding of alarms on the ACs may result in a 
     large number of PW status signaling messages generated. This may 
     have an impact on the performance of the MPLS control plane. This 
     issue should be investigated and solutions should be provided if 
     required. A method for aggregating PW status messages is one 
     possible solution.
