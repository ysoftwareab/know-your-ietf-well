Abstract 
    
   In mobile networks, the Mobile Router (MR) is an operational main 
   entity. With multiple MRs, mobile networks can provide the stability 
   of service. And, there already exist various multi-homing scenarios. 
   However, because of mobility and MR-HA relations, there are several 
   security problems in multi-homed mobile networks. In this draft, we 
   identify threats to multi-homed mobile networks. And we will 
   illustrate several scenarios of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, 
   Redirection attacks, and Replay attacks.

1. Multi-homing in Mobile Networks 
    
   NEMO Basic Support Protocol [1] has been proposed to support 
   transparent mobility to mobile network nodes (MNNs) with same 
   mobility in mobile networks. Using MR-HA bi-directional tunneling, 
   the MR provides the session mobility, continuity, and connectivity
   for all nodes in the mobile network as the network moves. Because the 
   MR manages every session to the mobile network, the availability of 
   MR affects all sessions to the mobile network.  
    
   However, there exist fault tolerance problem. The operational 
   concentration on the single MR has failure problems. Because the 
   egress MR has a responsibility on the operation of the whole mobile 
   nodes inside the subnet, single failure of MR can cause network 
   service suspension. Especially, egress channel or MR node 
   availability affect the session continuity and quality-of service. 
   Therefore, multiple MRs are required to the big-size networks, such 
   as train, bus, or airplane. And the other benefit of the multi-homing 
   is traffic load sharing through multiple MRs. Static and dynamic load 
   sharing mechanisms are possible at the HA level and MR level.  
    
   To support fault tolerance and load sharing, various type of multi-
   homed mobile networks have been considered in several drafts [2, 3, 
   4]. This Multi-homing concept can improve the performance of the 
   mobile network. And multi-homing can help to get several operational 
   advantages, like load balancing, network access cost optimization and

   optimal handover decision. Specific benefits of the multi-homing are 
   described in the multi-homing issue draft [2].  
    
   In NEMO threat analysis drafts [5, 6], threat for the NEMO basic 
   support protocols has been treated. In this draft, we introduce 
   several threats in multi-homed mobile networks. And we illustrate 
   some scenarios of attacks to multi-homed mobile networks. 
    
    
2. Related Multi-homing Scenarios 
    
   In multi-homing issue draft [2], various scenarios have been treated. 
   However, our concern is NEMO specific scenarios which can be 
   different from site multi-homing of multiple ISPs model. Based on the 
   above draft, we will describe our specific scope of multi-homed 
   mobile networks by the configuration.  
    
   Our main focus of multi-homed mobile networks is multiple Home Agent 
   (HA) existence scenarios. In multi-homing draft [2], (1, N, 1), (N, N, 
   1), (1, N, N) and (N, N, N) can be these cases. In current NEMO basic 
   support protocol, no additional messages are added to the Mobile IPv6. 
   However, in the presence of multiple HA, the multi-homed mobile 
   network can be insecure without the neighbor MR-HA information. 
   Especially in (N, N, 1) and (N, N, N) cases, multiple MR-HA relations 
   can lead severe security problem. Especially in S/mP-(N, N, 1) case, 
   different ISPs control each HA and each HA can't share the neighbor
   information. In this case, the tunnel recovery through the other MR 
   is difficult. For load balancing or fault recovery, the binding 
   update by the neighbor MR can be false without neighbor MR-HA 
   information. 
    
   In this draft, we focus on threats on the multi-homed mobile networks 
   with multiple HA.  
    
    
3. Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks  
    
   In this section, we will describe the possible attacks by Denial-of-
   Service (DoS) attacks. Even though some kinds of attacks are not NEMO 
   specific, these DoS attacks can be a preparation for another attack 
   to the mobile network. Therefore, we will briefly describe possible 
   DoS attacks. 
    
   In mobile networks, the MR can be exposed to various DoS attacks. 
   Because the MR has mobility, the access links are usually wireless 
   channel. Therefore, simple channel jamming can cause the service 
   unavailability. And, the packet flooding to the MR can lead the 
   normal service unavailable to mobile networks. Except the packet 
   flooding, the MR maintains binding update list and home agent list. 
   If some malicious nodes keep updating binding information, or sending

   the route optimization [7] request to the correspondent node (CN), 
   the MR can experience the overflow for this data structure. These DoS 
   attacks can be classified as a DoS attack to the binding related data 
   structure of the MR. To prevent this kind of attack, data structure 
   should be updated after verification of the requested node. And stale 
   binding update information in the binding update list should be 
   managed efficiently. Finally A black hole attack can be described as 
   a DoS attack. If the egress MR doesn't forward packets to the 
   destination, the flow can't be served at all. This attack is very 
   simple, but significant.  
    
   This service unavailability of the MR from the DoS attack and MR 
   failure requires tunnel recovery to an alternative tunnel in multi-
   homed mobile networks. 
    
    
4. Redirection Attack  
    
   Various types of redirection attacks can be possible in multi-homed 
   mobile networks. Types of redirection attacks are a redirection for 
   cryptographic analysis, redirection for DoS attack stream, and stream 
   redirection from the attacker node. Each attack is described as 
   follows.  
    
                                               MR3

                                         redirection      
                                                          
                  Figure 1. Redirection Attack by Fake MR 
    
    
4.1 Redirection for Cryptographic Analysis 
    
   For the redirection for cryptographic analysis, the fake MR can 
   compromise as an alternative MR to multi-homed mobile networks. After 
   the fake MR receives the previous tunnel to the primary MR, the fake 
   MR can cause packets to be sent to the attacker. The attacker might 
   receive packets to inspect or modify the payload or apply the 
   cryptographic analysis to find the secret key or decrypt the original

   data. In Figure 1, the Fake MR can forward the original flow to the 
   MNN3 which is an attacker. And the attacker node can analysis packet 
   flows to break the security association between HA1-MR1 or HA_MNN1-
   MNN1. 
    
    
4.2 Redirection for DoS Attack Stream 
    
   Redirected packets can be used as attack flows to other MR or MNN. 
   From this attack, packets can cause overload on the unrelated link. 
   And in this case, the attack might be able to hide the location and 
   identity. In Figure 1, the Fake MR can forward the original flow to 
   the MNN3 which is a victim node. MNN3 can suffer from DoS attack 
   stream which is identified as the attack stream from the CN of the 
   MNN1.  
    
    
4.3 Stream Redirection from the Attacker Node 
    
   Similarly, the Fake MR can lead a MNN to accept attacker's packets. 
   Unexpected packets can be delivered to the MNN by the redirection 
   attack. In Figure 1, MNN3 can receive the attack stream through the 
   Fake MR. Or MNN1 can receive the attack stream which is not from the 
   original CN, but from the attacker. Of course, this case would not be 
   the specific case of multi-homed mobile networks. 
    
   To prevent this kind of redirection attack, the neighbor egress MR 
   existence should be identified and the MR should be authenticated. 
   From this authentication, non-repudiation can be obtained. To support 
   authentication, the alternative MR registration mechanism is required. 
   To provide the alternative MR registration, the MR-HA communication 
   and HA-HA communication is required. From the MR and HA communication, 
   HA can register neighbor MR information. And from the HA-HA 
   communication, the validity of binding update information of the 
   neighbor MR toward its own HA can be obtained. 
    
    
5. Replay Attack 
    
   In mobile networks, the MR has mobility. Therefore, the neighbor 
   information can be stale after the neighbor moves away. Using 
   previous neighbor information, a malicious MR can send binding update 
   to false CoA. The malicious MR can move to the other place or already 
   moved MR can compromise to the replay attack. And this attack can be 
   used as another redirection attack. In Figure 2, after the Fake MR 
   changes the point of attachment, it can send the Binding Update 
   message to the wrong place using previous neighbor information. In 
   this case, similar redirection attacks in Section 4 are possible.

   To prevent the replay attack, the HA should keep the neighbor MR 
   information. And registration information should be updated whenever 
   the MR moves or disappears. To keep registration information safely, 
   expiration by the TTL and explicit removal after the neighbor MR 
   movement detection can be used. The neighbor MR movement detection 
   can be done after the periodic ICMP Mobile Prefix Advertisement 
   expiration.
