Internet-Draft       Aggregated RSVP over PCN            October 2014  

1.  Introduction

1.1 Objective

   Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) can support the quality of service 
   (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain in a simple, 
   scalable, and robust fashion.  Two mechanisms are used: admission 
   control and flow termination.  Admission control is used to decide 
   whether to admit or block a new flow request, while flow termination 
   is used in abnormal circumstances to decide whether to terminate some 
   of the existing flows.  To support these two features, the overall 
   rate of PCN-traffic is metered on every link in the domain, and PCN-
   packets are appropriately marked when certain configured rates are 
   exceeded.  These configured rates are below the rate of the link, 
   thus providing notification to boundary nodes about overloads before 
   any congestion occurs (hence "pre-congestion" notification).  The 
   PCN-egress-nodes measure the rates of differently marked PCN traffic 
   in periodic intervals and report these rates to the Decision Points 
   for admission control and flow termination; the Decision Points use 
   these rates to make decisions.  The Decision Points may be collocated 
   with the PCN-ingress-nodes, or their function may be implemented in a 
   another node. For more details see [RFC5559], [RFC6661], and 
   [RFC6662]. 
   
   The main objective of this document is to specify the signaling 
   protocol that can be used within a Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) 
   domain to carry reports from a PCN-ingress-node to a PCN Decision 
   point, considering that the PCN Decision Point and PCN-egress-node 
   are collocated.
   If the PCN Decision Point is not collocated with the PCN-egress-node 
   then additional signaling procedures are required that are out of 
   the scope of this document. Moreover, as mentioned above this 
   architecture conforms with PBAC (Policy-Based Admission Control), 
   when the Decision Point is located in a another node then the PCN-
   ingress-node [RFC2753].

   Several signaling protocols can be used to carry information between  
   PCN-boundary-nodes (PCN-ingress-node and PCN-egress-node). However, 
   since (1) both PCN-egress-node and PCN-ingress-nodes are located on 
   the data path and (2) the admission control procedure needs to be 
   done at PCN-egress-node, a signaling protocol that follows the same 
   path as the data path, like RSVP (Resource Reservation Protocol), is 
   more suited for this purpose. In particular, this document specifies 
   extensions to Generic Aggregated RSVP [RFC4860] for support of the 
   PCN Controlled Load (CL) and Single Marking (SM) edge behaviors over 
   a Diffserv cloud using Pre-Congestion Notification. 

   This draft is intended to be published as Experimental in order to:
   
      o) validate industry interest by allowing implementation and 
         deployment

      o) gather operational experience, in particular around dynamic 
         interactions of RSVP signaling and PCN notification and

         corresponding levels of performance.
      
   Support for the techniques specified in this document involves RSVP 
   functionality in boundary nodes of a PCN domain whose interior nodes 
   forward RSVP traffic without performing RSVP functionality.

1.2 Overview and Motivation

   Two main Quality of Service (QoS) architectures have been specified 
   by the IETF. These are the Integrated Services (Intserv) [RFC1633]
   architecture and the Differentiated Services (DiffServ) architecture
   ([RFC2475]).

   Intserv provides methods for the delivery of end-to-end Quality of 
   Service (QoS) to applications over heterogeneous networks. One of the 
   QoS signaling protocols used by the Intserv architecture is the 
   Resource reServation Protocol (RSVP) [RFC2205], which can be used by
   applications to request per-flow resources from the network. These 
   RSVP requests can be admitted or rejected by the network.
   Applications can express their quantifiable resource requirements 
   using Intserv parameters as defined in [RFC2211] and [RFC2212]. The 
   Controlled Load (CL) service [RFC2211] is a quality of service (QoS) 
   closely approximating the QoS that the same flow would receive from a 
   lightly loaded network element. The CL service is useful for 
   inelastic flows such as those used for real-time media. 

   The DiffServ architecture can support the differentiated treatment of 
   packets in very large scale environments. While Intserv and RSVP 
   classify packets per-flow, Diffserv networks classify packets into 
   one of a small number of aggregated flows or "classes", based on the
   Diffserv codepoint (DSCP) in the packet IP header. At each Diffserv
   router, packets are subjected to a "per-hop behavior" (PHB), which is
   invoked by the DSCP.  The primary benefit of Diffserv is its
   scalability, since the need for per-flow state and per-flow
   processing, is eliminated. 

   However, DiffServ does not include any mechanism for communication
   between applications and the network.  Several solutions have been
   specified to solve this issue. One of these solutions is Intserv over 
   Diffserv [RFC2998] including resource-based admission control (RBAC), 
   PBAC, assistance in traffic identification/classification, and 
   traffic conditioning. Intserv over Diffserv can operate over a 
   statically provisioned or a RSVP aware Diffserv region. When it is 
   RSVP aware, several mechanisms may be used to support dynamic 
   provisioning and topology-aware admission control, including 
   aggregate RSVP reservations, per-flow RSVP, or a bandwidth broker.  
   [RFC3175] specifies aggregation of Resource ReSerVation Protocol 
   (RSVP) end-to-end reservations over aggregate RSVP reservations. In 
   [RFC3175] the RSVP generic aggregated reservation is characterized by 
   a RSVP SESSION object using the 3-tuple <source IP address, 
   destination IP address, Diffserv Code Point>.

   Several scenarios require the use of multiple generic aggregate    
   reservations that are established for a given PHB from a given source 

Karagiannis, et al.       Expires April 6, 2015                [Page 5]

   IP address to a given destination IP address, see [SIG-NESTED], 
   [RFC4860]. For example, multiple generic aggregate reservations 
   can be applied in the situation that multiple E2E reservations using 
   different preemption priorities need to be aggregated through a PCN-
   domain using the same PHB. By using multiple aggregate reservations 
   for the same PHB, it allows enforcement of the different preemption 
   priorities within the aggregation region. This allows more efficient 
   management of the Diffserv resources, and in periods of resource 
   shortage, this allows sustainment of a larger number of E2E 
   reservations with higher preemption priorities. In particular, 
   [SIG-NESTED] discusses in detail how end-to-end RSVP reservations can 
   be established in a nested VPN environment through RSVP aggregation.

   [RFC4860] provides generic aggregate reservations by extending    
   [RFC3175] to support multiple aggregate reservations for the same 
   source IP address, destination IP address, and PHB (or set of PHBs).
   In particular, multiple such generic aggregate reservations can be 
   established for a given PHB from a given source IP address to a given 
   destination IP address. This is achieved by adding the concept of a 
   Virtual Destination Port and of an Extended Virtual Destination Port 
   in the RSVP SESSION object. In addition to this, the RSVP SESSION 
   object for generic aggregate reservations uses the PHB Identification 
   Code (PHB-ID) defined in [RFC3140], instead of using the Diffserv 
   Code Point (DSCP) used in [RFC3175]. The PHB-ID is used to identify 
   the PHB, or set of PHBs, from which the Diffserv resources are to be 
   reserved.  
   The RSVP like signaling protocol required to carry (1) requests from 
   a PCN-egress-node to a PCN-ingress-node and (2) reports from a  
   PCN-ingress-node to a PCN-egress-node needs to follow the PCN 
   signaling requirements defined in [RFC6663]. In addition to 
   that the signaling protocol functionality supported by the PCN-
   ingress-nodes and PCN-egress-nodes needs to maintain logical 
   aggregate constructs (i.e. ingress-egress-aggregate state) and be 
   able to map E2E reservations to these aggregate constructs. Moreover, 
   no actual reservation state is needed to be maintained inside the PCN 
   domain, i.e., the PCN-interior-nodes are not maintaining any 
   reservation state.

   This can be accomplished by two possible approaches:

   Approach (1):
   
     o) adapting the RFC 4860 aggregation procedures to fit the PCN 
        requirements with as little change as possible over the RFC 4860 
        functionality

     o) hence performing aggregate RSVP signaling (even if it is to be 
        ignored by PCN interior nodes)

     o) using this aggregate RSVP signaling procedures to carry PCN 
        information between the PCN-boundary-nodes (PCN-ingress-node and 
        PCN-egress-node).

Internet-Draft       Aggregated RSVP over PCN           October 2014    

   Approach (2):

     o) adapting the RFC 4860 aggregation procedures to fit the PCN 
        requirements with more significant changes over RFC4860 (i.e. 
        the aspect of the procedures that have to do with maintaining 
        aggregate states and to do with mapping the E2E reservations to 
        aggregate constructs are kept, but the procedures that have to 
        do with the aggregate RSVP signaling and aggregate reservation 
        establishment/maintenance are dropped).  
  
     o) hence not performing aggregate RSVP signaling

     o) piggy-backing of the PCN information inside the E2E RSVP 
        signaling.

   Both approaches are probably viable, however, since the RFC 4860 
   operations have been thoroughly studied and implemented, it can be 
   considered that the RFC 4860 solution can better deal with the more 
   challenging situations (rerouting in the PCN domain, failure of an 
   PCN-ingress-node, failure of an PCN-egress-node, rerouting towards a 
   different edge, etc.). This is the reason for choosing Approach (1) 
   for the specification of the signaling protocol used to carry 
   PCN information between the PCN-boundary-nodes (PCN-ingress-node and 
   PCN-egress-node).

   In particular, this document specifies extensions to Generic 
   Aggregated RSVP [RFC4860] for support of the PCN Controlled Load (CL) 
   and Single Marking (SM) edge behaviors over a Diffserv cloud using 
   Pre-Congestion Notification. 

   This document follows the PCN signaling requirements defined in 
   [RFC6663] and specifies extensions to Generic Aggregated RSVP 
   [RFC4860] for support of PCN edge behaviors as specified in 
   [RFC6661] and [RFC6662]. Moreover, this document specifies how RSVP 
   aggregation can be used to setup and maintain: (1) Ingress Egress 
   Aggregate (IEA) states at Ingress and Egress nodes and (2) generic 
   aggregation of RSVP end-to-end RSVP reservations over PCN (Congestion 
   and Pre-Congestion Notification) domains. 

   To comply with this specification, PCN-nodes MUST be able to 
   support the functionality specified in [RFC5670], [RFC5559], 
   [RFC6660], [RFC6661], [RFC6662]. Furthermore, the PCN-boundary-nodes 
   MUST support the RSVP generic aggregated reservation procedures 
   specified in [RFC4860] which are augmented with procedures specified 
   in this document.

1.3.  Terminology 

   This document uses terms defined in [RFC4860], [RFC3175], [RFC5559], 
   [RFC5670], [RFC6661], [RFC6662].

   For readability, a number of definitions from [RFC3175] as well as
   definitions for terms used in [RFC5559], [RFC6661], and [RFC6662] are 
   provided here, where some of them are augmented with new meanings:

   Aggregator       This is the process in (or associated with) the
                    router at the ingress edge of the aggregation region
                    (with respect to the end-to-end RSVP reservation)
                    and behaving in accordance with [RFC4860].  In this
                    document, it is also the PCN-ingress-node. It is 
                    important to notice that in the context of this 
                    document the Aggregator must be able to determine 
                    the Deaggregator using the procedures specified in 
                    Section 4 of [RFC4860] and in Section 1.4.2 of 
                    [RFC3175]. 

  Congestion level estimate (CLE):
                    The ratio of PCN-marked to total PCN-traffic 
                    (measured in octets) received for a given ingress-
                    egress-aggregate during a given measurement period.  
                    The CLE is used to derive the PCN-admission-state  
                    and is also used by the report suppression procedure    
                    if report suppression is activated.  

   Deaggregator     This is the process in (or associated with) the
                    router at the egress edge of the aggregation region
                    (with respect to the end-to-end RSVP reservation)
                    and behaving in accordance with [RFC4860].  In this
                    document, it is also the PCN-egress-node and 
                    Decision Point. 

   E2E             end to end

   E2E Reservation  This is an RSVP reservation such that:

                    (i)   corresponding RSVP Path messages are initiated
                          upstream of the Aggregator and terminated
                          downstream of the Deaggregator, and

                    (ii)  corresponding RSVP Resv messages are initiated
                          downstream of the Deaggregator and terminated
                          upstream of the Aggregator, and

                    (iii) this RSVP reservation is aggregated over an
                          Ingress Egress Aggregate (IEA) between the 
                          Aggregator and Deaggregator. 
                    An E2E RSVP reservation may be a per-flow
                    reservation, which in this document is only 
                    maintained at the PCN-ingress-node and PCN-egress-
                    node. Alternatively, the E2E reservation may itself 
                    be an aggregate reservation of various types (e.g., 
                    Aggregate IP reservation, Aggregate IPsec
                    reservation, see [RFC4860]). As per regular RSVP 
                    operations, E2E RSVP  reservations are 
                    unidirectional.

   E2E microflow    a microflow where its associated packets are being 
                    forwarded on an E2E path.

   Extended vDstPort (Extended Virtual Destination Port)

                     An identifier used in the SESSION that remains 
                     constant over the life of the generic aggregate 
                     reservation. The length of this identifier is 32-
                     bits when IPv4 addresses are used and 128 bits when 
                     IPv6 addresses are used. 
                     A sender(or Aggregator) that wishes to narrow the 
                     scope of a SESSION to the sender-receiver pair (or 
                     Aggregator-Deaggregator pair) should place its IPv4 
                     or IPv6 address here as a network unique 
                     identifier. A sender (or Aggregator) that wishes to 
                     use a common session with other senders (or 
                     Aggregators) in order to use a shared reservation 
                     across senders (or Aggregators) must set this field 
                     to all zeros. In this document, the Extended 
                     vDstPort should contain the IPv4 or IPv6 address of 
                     the Aggregator.

   ETM-rate
                     The rate of excess-traffic-marked PCN-traffic 
                     received at a PCN-egress-node for a given ingress-
                     egress-aggregate in octets per second.  
 
  Ingress-egress-aggregate (IEA): 
                    The collection of PCN-packets from all PCN-flows 
                    that travel in one direction between a specific pair 
                    of PCN-boundary-nodes. In this document one RSVP 
                    generic aggregated reservation is mapped to only 
                    one ingress-egress-aggregate, while one 
                    ingress-egress-aggregate is mapped to either 
                    one or to more than one RSVP generic aggregated  
                    reservations. PCN-flows and their PCN-traffic that 
                    are mapped into a specific RSVP generic aggregated 
                    reservation can also easily be mapped into their   
                    corresponding ingress-egress-aggregate.

   Microflow:       a single instance of an application-to-application 
 (from [RFC2474])   flow of packets which is identified by source 
                    address, destination address, protocol id, and 
                    source port, destination port (where applicable).

   PCN-domain:      a PCN-capable domain; a contiguous set of 
                    PCN-enabled nodes that perform Diffserv scheduling 
                    [RFC2474]; the complete set of PCN-nodes that in 
                    principle can, through PCN-marking packets, 
                    influence decisions about flow admission and 
                    termination within the domain; includes the PCN-
                    egress-nodes, which measure these PCN-marks, and the 
                    PCN-ingress-nodes.

   PCN-boundary-node: a PCN-node that connects one PCN-domain to a node 
                    either in another PCN-domain or in a non-PCN-domain.

Internet-Draft       Aggregated RSVP over PCN            October 2014   

   PCN-interior-node: a node in a PCN-domain that is not a PCN-
                    boundary-node.

   PCN-node:        a PCN-boundary-node or a PCN-interior-node.

   PCN-egress-node: a PCN-boundary-node in its role in handling
                    traffic as it leaves a PCN-domain. In this 
                    document the PCN-egress-node operates also as a 
                    Decision Point and Deaggregator.

   PCN-ingress-node: a PCN-boundary-node in its role in handling
                    traffic as it enters a PCN-domain. In this 
                    document the PCN-ingress-node operates also as a 
                    Aggregator.

   PCN-traffic, 
   PCN-packets, 
   PCN-BA:          a PCN-domain carries traffic of different Diffserv 
                    behavior aggregates (BAs) [RFC2474]. The PCN-BA 
                    uses the PCN mechanisms to carry PCN-traffic, and 
                    the corresponding packets are PCN-packets.  
                    The same network will carry traffic of other 
                    Diffserv BAs.  The PCN-BA is
                    distinguished by a combination of the Diffserv 
                    codepoint (DSCP) and ECN fields.

   PCN-flow:        the unit of PCN-traffic that the PCN-boundary-node 
                    admits (or terminates); the unit could be a single 
                    E2E microflow (as defined in [RFC2474]) or some 
                    identifiable collection of microflows.

   PCN-admission-state:
                    The state ("admit" or "block") derived by the 
                    Decision Point for a given ingress-egress-aggregate 
                    based on statistics about PCN-packet marking.  The 
                    Decision Point decides to admit or block new flows 
                    offered to the aggregate based on the current value 
                    of the PCN-admission-state.  

   PCN-sent-rate
                     The rate of PCN-traffic received at a PCN-ingress-
                     node and destined for a given ingress-egress-
                     aggregate in octets per second. 

   PHB-ID (Per Hop Behavior Identification Code)
                     A 16-bit field containing the Per Hop Behavior 
                     Identification Code of the PHB, or of the set of 
                     PHBs, from which Diffserv resources
                     are to be reserved.  This field must be encoded as 
                     specified in Section 2 of [RFC3140].

   RSVP generic aggregated reservation: an RSVP reservation that is  
                    identified by using the RSVP SESSION object 
                    for generic RSVP aggregated reservation. This RSVP

                    SESSION object is based on the RSVP SESSION object 
                    specified in [RFC4860] augmented with the following 
                    information:


                    o) the IPv4 DestAddress, IPv6 DestAddress should be 
                       set to the IPv4 or IPv6 destination addresses, 
                       respectively, of the Deaggregator (PCN-egress-
                       node)

                    o) PHB-ID (Per Hop Behavior Identification Code) 
                       should be set equal to PCN-compatible Diffserv 
                       codepoint(s).

                    o) Extended vDstPort should be set to the IPv4 or 
                       IPv6 destination addresses, of the Aggregator 
                       (PCN-ingress-node)

   VDstPort (Virtual Destination Port)

                     A 16-bit identifier used in the SESSION that 
                     remains constant over the life of the generic 
                     aggregate reservation.

1.4. Organization of This Document

   This document is organized as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of 
   RSVP extensions and operations. The elements of the used procedures 
   are specified in Section 3. Section 4 describes the protocol 
   elements. The security considerations are given in section 5 and the 
   IANA considerations are provided in Section 6. 

2.  Overview of RSVP extensions and Operations 

2.1 Overview of RSVP Aggregation Procedures in PCN domains

   The PCN-boundary-nodes, see Figure 1, can support RSVP SESSIONS for 
   generic aggregated reservations {RFC4860], which are depending on 
   ingress-egress-aggregates. In particular, one RSVP generic aggregated 
   reservation matches to only one ingress-egress-aggregate. 

   However, one ingress-egress-aggregate matches to either 
   one, or more than one, RSVP generic aggregated reservations. 
   In addition, to comply with this specification, the PCN-boundary 
   nodes need to distinguish and process (1) RSVP SESSIONS for generic 
   aggregated sessions and their messages according to [RFC4860], (2) 
   E2E RSVP sessions and messages according to [RFC2205]. 

   This document locates all RSVP processing for a PCN domain at PCN-
   Boundary nodes. PCN-interior-nodes do not perform any RSVP  
   functionality or maintain RSVP-related state information. Rather, 
   PCN-interior nodes forward all RSVP messages (for both generic 
   aggregated reservations[RFC4860] and end to end reservations 
   [RFC2205]) as if they were ordinary network traffic.

Internet-Draft       Aggregated RSVP over PCN           October 2014    

   Moreover, each Aggregator and Deaggregator (i.e., PCN-boundary-nodes) 
   need to support policies to initiate and maintain for each pair of 
   PCN-boundary-nodes of the same PCN-domain one ingress-egress-
   aggregate.

           Figure 1 : Aggregation of E2E Reservations
            over Generic Aggregate RSVP Reservations 
               in PCN domains, based on [RFC4860]

   Both the Aggregator and Deaggregator can maintain one or 
   more RSVP generic aggregated Reservations, but the Deaggregator is 
   the entity that initiates these RSVP generic aggregated reservations. 
   Note that one RSVP generic aggregated reservation  matches to only 
   one ingress-egress-aggregate, while one ingress-egress-aggregate 
   matches to either one or to more than one RSVP generic aggregated 
   reservations. This can be accomplished by using for the different 
   RSVP generic aggregated reservations the same  combinations of 
   ingress and egress identifiers, but with a different PHB-ID value 
   (see [RFC4860]). The procedures for aggregation of E2E reservations 
   over generic aggregate RSVP reservations are the same as the 
   procedures specified in Section 4 of [RFC4860], augmented with the 
   ones specified in Section 2.5. 

   One significant difference between this document and [RFC4860] is the 
   fact that in this document the admission control of E2E RSVP 
   reservations over the PCN core is performed according to the PCN 
   procedures, while in [RFC4860] this is achieved via first admitting 
   aggregate RSVP reservations over the aggregation region and then 
   admitting the E2E reservations over the aggregate RSVP reservations. 
   Therefore, in this document, the RSVP generic aggregate RSVP 
   reservations are not subject to admission control in the PCN-core, 
   and the E2E RSVP reservations are not subject to admission control

Internet-Draft       Aggregated RSVP over PCN           October 2014    

   over the aggregate reservations. In turn, this means that several 
   procedures of [RFC4860] are significantly simplified in this 
   document:
      o) unlike [RFC4860], the generic aggregate RSVP reservations need 
         not be admitted in the PCN core.
      o) unlike [RFC4860], the RSVP aggregated traffic does not need to 
         be tunneled between Aggregator and Deaggregator, see Section 
         2.3.
      o) unlike [RFC4860], the Deaggregator need not perform admission  
         control of E2E reservations over the aggregate RSVP 
         reservations.  
      o) unlike [RFC4860], there is no need for dynamic adjustment of 
         the RSVP generic aggregated reservation size, see Section 2.6.

2.2   PCN Marking and encoding and transport of pre-congestion 
        information

   The method of PCN marking within the PCN domain is specified in 
   [RFC5670]. In addition, the method of encoding and transport of pre-
   congestion information is specified in [RFC6660]. The PHB-ID (Per Hop 
   Behavior Identification Code) used SHOULD be set equal 
   to PCN-compatible Diffserv codepoint(s).

2.3.  Traffic Classification Within The Aggregation Region

   The PCN-ingress marks a PCN-BA using PCN-marking (i.e., combination 
   of the DSCP and ECN fields), which interior nodes use to
   classify PCN-traffic. The PCN-traffic (e.g., E2E microflows) 
   belonging to a RSVP generic aggregated reservation can be 
   classified only at the PCN-boundary-nodes (i.e., Aggregator and 
   Deaggregator) by using the RSVP SESSION object for RSVP generic 
   aggregated reservations, see Section 2.1 of [RFC4860]. Note that the   
   DSCP value included in the SESSION object, SHOULD be set equal 
   to a PCN-compatible Diffserv codepoint. Since no admission control 
   procedures over the RSVP generic aggregated reservations in the PCN-
   core are required, unlike [RFC4860], the RSVP aggregated traffic need 
   not to be tunneled between Aggregator and Deaggregator. In this 
   document one RSVP generic aggregated reservation is mapped to only 
   one ingress-egress-aggregate, while one ingress-egress-aggregate is 
   mapped to either one or to more than one RSVP generic aggregated 
   reservations. PCN-flows and their PCN-traffic that are mapped into a 
   specific RSVP generic aggregated reservation can also easily be 
   classified into their corresponding ingress-egress-aggregate. The 
   method of traffic conditioning of PCN-traffic and non-PCN traffic and 
   PHB configuration is described in [RFC6661] and [RFC6662].

2.4.  Deaggregator Determination

   The present document assumes the same dynamic Deaggregator 
   determination method as used in [RFC4860].     

2.5.  Mapping E2E Reservations Onto Aggregate Reservations

   To comply with this specification for the mapping of E2E reservations 

Karagiannis, et al.      Expires April 6, 2015                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft       Aggregated RSVP over PCN           October 2014    

   onto aggregate reservations, the same methods MUST be used as the 
   ones described in Section 4 of [RFC4860], augmented by the following 
   rules:

   o) An Aggregator (also PCN-ingress-node in this document) or 
      Deaggregator (also PCN-egress-node and Decision Point in this 
      document) MUST use one or more policies to determine whether a 
      RSVP generic aggregated reservation can be mapped into an ingress-
      Egress-aggregate. This can be accomplished by using for the 
      different RSVP generic aggregated reservations the same 
      combinations of ingress and egress identifiers, but with a 
      different PHB-ID value (see [RFC4860]) corresponding to the PCN 
      specifications. In particular, the RSVP SESSION object specified 
      in [RFC4860] augmented with the following information:

         o) the IPv4 DestAddress, IPv6 DestAddress MUST be set to the 
         IPv4 or IPv6 destination addresses, respectively, of the 
         Deaggregator (PCN-egress-node), see [RFC4860]. Note that the 
         PCN-domain is considered as being only one RSVP hop (for 
         Generic aggregated RSVP or E2E RSVP). This means that the next 
         RSVP hop for the Aggregator in the downstream direction is the 
         Deaggregator and the next RSVP hop for the Deaggregator in the 
         upstream direction is the Aggregator.

         o) PHB-ID (Per Hop Behavior Identification Code) SHOULD be set 
         equal to PCN-compatible Diffserv codepoint(s).

         o) Extended vDstPort SHOULD be set to the IPv4 or IPv6 
         destination addresses, of the Aggregator (PCN-ingress-node), 
         see [RFC4860].

2.6.  Size of Aggregate Reservations

   Since:(i) no admission control of E2 reservations over the RSVP 
   aggregated reservations is required, and (ii) no admission control of 
   the RSVP aggregated reservation over the PCN core is required,
   the size of the generic aggregate reservation is irrelevant and can 
   be set to any arbitrary value by the Deaggreagtor. The Deaggregator 
   SHOULD set the value of a generic aggregate reservation to a null 
   bandwidth. We also observe that there is no need for dynamic 
   adjustment of the RSVP aggregated reservation size. 

2.7.  E2E Path ADSPEC update

   To comply with this specification, for the update of the E2E Path 
   ADSPEC, the same methods can be used as the ones described in 
   [RFC4860].

2.8.  Intra-domain Routes

   The PCN-interior-nodes are neither maintaining E2E RSVP nor RSVP   
   generic aggregation states and reservations. Therefore, intra-domain 
   route changes will not affect intra-domain reservations since such 
   reservations are not maintained by the PCN-interior-nodes. 

Karagiannis, et al.   Expires April 6, 2015                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft       Aggregated RSVP over PCN           October 2014   

   Furthermore, it is considered that by configuration, the PCN-
   interior-nodes are not able to distinguish neither RSVP generic 
   aggregated sessions and their associated messages [RFC4860], nor E2E 
   RSVP sessions and their associated messages [RFC2205].


2.9.  Inter-domain Routes

   The PCN-charter scope precludes inter-domain considerations. However, 
   for solving inter-domain routes changes associated with the operation 
   of the RSVP messages, the same methods SHOULD be used as the ones 
   described in [RFC4860] and in Section 1.4.7 of 
   [RFC3175]. 


2.10.  Reservations for Multicast Sessions

   PCN does not consider reservations for multicast sessions. 


2.11.  Multi-level Aggregation

   PCN does not consider multi-level aggregations within the PCN domain. 
   Therefore, the PCN-interior-nodes are not supporting multi-level 
   aggregation procedures. However, the Aggregator and Deaggregator 
   SHOULD support the multi-level aggregation procedures specified in 
   [RFC4860] and in Section 1.4.9 of [RFC3175]. 


2.12.  Reliability Issues

   To comply with this specification, for solving possible reliability 
   issues, the same methods MUST used as the ones described in Section 4 
   of [RFC4860].


3. Elements of Procedure

   This section describes the procedures used to implement the 
   aggregated RSVP procedure over PCN. It is considered that the 
   procedures for aggregation of E2E reservations over generic aggregate 
   RSVP reservations are same as the procedures specified in Section 
   4 of [RFC4860] except where a departure from these procedures is 
   explicitly described in the present section. Please refer to 
   [RFC4860] for all the below error  
   cases:
      o) Incomplete message
      o) Unexpected objects

3.1.  Receipt of E2E Path Message by Aggregating router

   When the E2E Path message arrives at the exterior interface of the 
   Aggregator, (also PCN-ingress-node in this document), then standard 
   RSVP generic aggregation [RFC4860] procedures are used.

Internet-Draft       Aggregated RSVP over PCN           October 2014   

3.2.  Handling Of E2E Path Message by Interior Routers

   The E2E Path messages traverse zero or more PCN-interior-nodes. 
   The PCN-interior-nodes receive the E2E Path message on an interior 
   interface and forward it on another interior interface. 
   It is considered that, by configuration, the PCN-interior-nodes 
   ignore the E2E RSVP signaling messages [RFC2205]. Therefore, the E2E 
   Path messages are simply forwarded as normal IP datagrams. 

3.3.  Receipt of E2E Path Message by Deaggregating router

   When receiving the E2E Path message the Deaggregator (also PCN-
   egress-node and Decision Point in this document) performs the 
   regular [RFC4860] procedures, augmented with the following rules:

     o) The Deaggregator MUST NOT perform the RSVP-TTL vs IP TTL-
        check and MUST NOT update the ADspec Break bit. This is because 
        the whole PCN-domain is effectively handled by E2E RSVP as a 
        virtual link on which integrated service is indeed supported 
        (and admission control performed) so that the Break bit MUST 
        NOT be set, see also [draft-lefaucheur-rsvp-ecn-01].

    The Deaggregator forwards the E2E Path message towards the 
    receiver.

3.4.  Initiation of new Aggregate Path Message by Aggregating Router

   To comply with this specification, for the initiation of the new RSVP 
   generic aggregated Path message by the Aggregator (also PCN-ingress-
   node in this document), the same methods MUST be used as the ones 
   described in [RFC4860]. 

3.5.  Handling Of Aggregate Path Message By Interior Routers

   The Aggregate Path messages traverse zero or more PCN-interior-nodes. 
   The PCN-interior-nodes receive the Aggregated Path message on an 
   interior interface and forward it on another interior interface.   
   It is considered that, by configuration, the PCN-interior-nodes 
   ignore the Aggregated Path signaling messages. Therefore, the 
   Aggregated Path messages are simply forwarded as normal IP datagrams. 

3.6.  Handling Of Aggregate Path Message By Deaggregating Router

   When receiving the Aggregated Path message, the Deaggregator (also 
   PCN-egress-node and Decision Point in this document) performs the 
   regular [RFC4860] procedures, augmented with the following rules:

   o) When the received Aggregated Path message by the Deaggregator 
      contains the RSVP-AGGREGATE-IPv4-PCN-response or 
      RSVP-AGGREGATE-IPv6-PCN-response PCN objects, which carry the 
      PCN-sent-rate, then the procedures specified in Section 3.18 of 
      this document MUST be followed.

3.7.  Handling of E2E Resv Message by Deaggregating Router

   When the E2E Resv message arrives at the exterior interface of the 
   Deaggregator, (also PCN-egress-node and Decision Point in this 
   document) then standard RSVP aggregation [RFC4860] procedures are 
   used, augmented with the following rules:

  o) The E2E RSVP session associated with an E2E Resv 
     message that arrives at the external interface of the Deaggregator 
     is mapped/matched with an RSVP generic aggregate and with a PCN 
     ingress-egress-aggregate.
     
  o) Depending on the type of the PCN edge behavior supported by the 
     Deaggregator, the PCN admission control procedures specified in 
     Section 3.3.1 of [RFC6661] or [RFC6662] MUST be followed. Since no 
     admission control procedures over the RSVP aggregated reservations 
     in the PCN-core are required, unlike [RFC4860], the Deaggregator 
     does not perform any admission control of the E2E Reservation over 
     the mapped generic aggregate RSVP reservation. If the PCN based 
     admission control procedure is successful then the Deaggregator 
     MUST allow the new flow to be admitted onto the associated RSVP 
     generic aggregation reservation and onto the PCN ingress-egress-
     aggregate, see [RFC6661] and [RFC6662]. If the PCN based admission 
     control procedure is not successful, then the E2E Resv MUST NOT be 
     admitted onto the associated RSVP generic aggregate reservation and 
     onto the PCN ingress-egress-aggregation. The E2E Resv message is 
     further processed according to [RFC4860].

   The way of how the PCN-admission-state is maintained is specified in
   [RFC6661] and [RFC6662]. 

3.8.  Handling Of E2E Resv Message By Interior Routers

   The E2E Resv messages traversing the PCN core are IP addressed to the 
   Aggregating router and are not marked with Router Alert, therefore 
   the E2E Resv messages are simply forwarded as normal IP datagrams. 

3.9.  Initiation of New Aggregate Resv Message By Deaggregating Router

   To comply with this specification, for the initiation of the new RSVP 
   generic aggregated Resv message by the Deaggregator (also PCN-egress-
   node and Decision Point in this document), the same methods MUST be 
   used as the ones described in 
   Section 4 of [RFC4860] augmented with the following rules: 

   o) The size of the generic aggregate reservation is irrelevant, see 
      Section 2.6, and can be set to any arbitrary value by the PCN-
      egress node. The Deaggregator SHOULD set the value of a RSVP 
      generic aggregate reservation to a null bandwidth. We also 
      observe that there is no need for dynamic adjustment of the RSVP 
      generic aggregated reservation size.

Internet-Draft       Aggregated RSVP over PCN           October 2014    

   o) When [RFC6661] is used and the ETM-rate measured by the 
      Deaggregator contains a non-zero value for some 
      ingress-egress-aggregate, see [RFC6661] and [RFC6662], the 
      Deagregator MUST request the PCN-ingress-node to provide an 
      estimate of the rate (PCN-sent-rate) at which the Aggregator 
      (also PCN-ingress-node in this document) is receiving PCN-traffic 
      that is destined for the given ingress-egress-aggregate. 

   o) When [RFC6662] is used and the PCN-admission-state computed by the 
      Deaggregator, on the basis of the CLE is "block" for the given 
      ingress-egress-aggregate, the Deaggregator MUST request the PCN-
      ingress-node to provide an estimate of the rate (PCN-sent-rate) at 
      which the Aggregator is receiving PCN-traffic that is 
      destined for the given ingress-egress-aggregate. 

   o) In the above two cases and when the PCN-sent-rate needs to be 
      requested from the Aggregator, the Deaggregator MUST generate 
      and send an (refresh) Aggregated Resv message to the Aggregator 
      that MUST carry one of the following PCN objects, see Section 4.1, 
      depending on whether IPv4 or IPv6 is supported:        
       o) RSVP-AGGREGATE-IPv4-PCN-request 
       o) RSVP-AGGREGATE-IPv6-PCN-request.

3.10.  Handling of Aggregate Resv Message by Interior Routers

   The Aggregated Resv messages traversing the PCN core are IP addressed 
   to the Aggregating router and are not marked with Router Alert, 
   therefore the Aggregated Resv messages are simply forwarded as normal 
   IP datagrams. 

3.11.  Handling of E2E Resv Message by Aggregating Router

   When the E2E Resv message arrives at the interior interface of the 
   Aggregator (also PCN-ingress-node in this document), then standard 
   RSVP aggregation [RFC4860] procedures are used.

3.12.  Handling of Aggregated Resv Message by Aggregating Router

   When the Aggregated Resv message arrives at the interior interface of 
   the Aggregator, (also PCN-ingress-node in this document), 
   then standard RSVP aggregation [RFC4860] procedures are used, 
   augmented with the following rules: 
   o) the Aggregator SHOULD use the information carried by the PCN 
      objects, see Section 4, and follow the steps specified in 
      [RFC6661], [RFC6662]. If the "R" flag carried by the 
      RSVP-AGGREGATE-IPv4-PCN-request or RSVP-AGGREGATE-IPv6-PCN-request 
      PCN objects is set to ON, see Section 4.1, then the Aggregator 
      follows the steps described in Section 3.4 of [RFC6661] and 
      [RFC6662] on calculating the PCN-sent-rate. In particular, the 
      Aggregator MUST provide the estimated current rate of PCN-traffic 
      received at that node and destined for a given ingress-egress-
      aggregate in octets per second (the PCN-sent-rate). The way this 
      rate estimate is derived is a matter of implementation, see 
      [RFC6661] or [RFC6662].

Internet-Draft       Aggregated RSVP over PCN           October 2014    

   o) the Aggregator initiates an Aggregated Path message. In 
      particular, when the Aggregator receives an Aggregated Resv  
      message which carries one of the following PCN objects: 
      RSVP-AGGREGATE-IPv4-PCN-request or RSVP-AGGREGATE-IPv6-PCN-
      request, with the flag "R" set to ON, see Section 4.1, the 
      Aggregator initiates an Aggregated Path message, and includes the 
      calculated PCN-sent-rate into the RSVP-AGGREGATE-IPv4-PCN-response 
      or RSVP-AGGREGATE-IPv6-PCN-response PCN objects, see Section 4.1, 
      which that MUST be carried by the Aggregated Path message. This 
      Aggregated Path message is sent towards the Deaggregator (also 
      PCN-egress-node and Decision Point in this document) that 
      requested the calculation of the PCN-sent-rate.  

3.13.  Removal of E2E Reservation

   To comply with this specification, for the removal of E2E 
   reservations, the same methods MUST be used as the ones described in 
   Section 4 of [RFC4860] and [RFC4495]. 

3.14.  Removal of Aggregate Reservation
 
   To comply with this specification, for the removal of RSVP generic 
   aggregated reservations, the same methods MUST be used as the ones 
   described in Section 4 of [RFC4860] and Section 2.10 of [RFC3175]. In 
   particular, should an aggregate reservation go away (presumably due 
   to a configuration change, route change, or policy event), the E2E 
   reservations it supports are no longer active. 
   They MUST be treated accordingly.

3.15.  Handling of Data On Reserved E2E Flow by Aggregating Router

   The handling of data on the reserved E2E flow by Aggregator (also   
   PCN-ingress-node in this document) uses the procedures described 
   in [RFC4860] augmented with:
   o)  Regarding, PCN marking and traffic classification the procedures 
       defined in Section 2.2 and 2.3 of this document are used.

3.16.  Procedures for Multicast Sessions

   In this document no multicast sessions are considered.

3.17.  Misconfiguration of PCN-node

   In an event where a PCN-node is misconfigured within a PCN-domain, 
   the desired behavior is same as described in Section 3.10. 

3.18 PCN based Flow Termination

   When the Deaggregator (also PCN-egress-node and Decision Point in 
   this document) needs to terminate an amount of traffic associated 
   with one ingress-egress-aggregate (see Section 3.3.2 of [RFC6661] and 
   [RFC6662]), then several procedures of terminating E2E microflows can 
   be deployed. The default procedure of terminating E2E microflows 
   (i.e., PCN-flows) is as follows, see i.e., [RFC6661] and [RFC6662].

Internet-Draft         Aggregated RSVP over PCN           October 2014  

   For the same ingress-egress-aggregate, select a number of E2E    
   microflows to be terminated in order to decrease the total incoming    
   amount of bandwidth associated with one ingress-egress-aggregate by   
   the amount of traffic to be terminated, see above. In this situation 
   the same mechanisms for terminating an E2E microflow can be followed 
   as specified in [RFC2205]. However, based on a local policy, the 
   Deaggregator could use other ways of selecting which microflows 
   should be terminated. For example, for the same ingress-egress-
   aggregate, select a number of E2E microflows to be terminated or to 
   reduce their reserved bandwidth in order to decrease the total 
   incoming amount of bandwidth associated with one ingress-egress-
   aggregate by the amount of traffic to be terminated. In this 
   situation the same mechanisms for terminating an E2E microflow or 
   reducing bandwidth associated with an E2E microflow can be followed 
   as specified in [RFC4495].
   
4.  Protocol Elements

   The protocol elements in this document are using the ones defined in 
   Section 4 of [RFC4860] and Section 3 of [RFC3175] augmented with the 
   following rules:
   o) the DSCP value included in the SESSION object, SHOULD be set equal 
      to a PCN-compatible Diffserv codepoint. 

   o) Extended vDstPort SHOULD be set to the IPv4 or IPv6 destination 
      addresses, of the Aggregator (also PCN-ingress-node in this 
      document), see [RFC4860].

   o) When the Deaggregator (also PCN-egress-node and Decision Point 
      in this document) needs to request the PCN-sent-rate from the 
      PCN-ingress-node, see Section 3.9 of this document, the 
      Deaggregator MUST generate and send an (refresh) Aggregate 
      Resv message to the Aggregator that MUST carry one of the 
      following PCN objects, see Section 4.1, depending on whether IPv4 
      or IPv6 is supported:     
       o) RSVP-AGGREGATE-IPv4-PCN-request 
       o) RSVP-AGGREGATE-IPv6-PCN-request.

  o) When the Aggregator receives an Aggregate Resv message which 
      carries one of the following PCN objects: 
      RSVP-AGGREGATE-IPv4-PCN-request or 
      RSVP-AGGREGATE-IPv6-PCN-request, with the flag "R" set to ON, see 
      Section 4.1, then the Aggregator MUST generate and send to the     
      Deaggregator an Aggregated Path message which carries one of the 
      following PCN objects, see Section 4.1, depending on whether IPv4 
      or IPv6 is supported:  
       o) RSVP-AGGREGATE-IPv4-PCN-response, 
       o) RSVP-AGGREGATE-IPv6-PCN-response.

4.1 PCN objects

   This section describes four types of PCN objects that can be carried 
   by the (refresh) Aggregate Path or the (refresh) Aggregate Resv 
   messages specified in [RFC4860].

  The fields carried by the PCN object are specified in 
   [RFC6663], [RFC6661] and [RFC6662]:

     o the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the PCN-ingress-node (Aggregator) and 
       the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the PCN-egress-node (Deaggregator); 
       together they specify the ingress-egress-aggregate to which the 
       report refers. According to [RFC6663] the report should carry the 
       identifier of the PCN-ingress-node (Aggregator) and the 
       identifier of the PCN-egress-node (Deaggregator) (typically 
       their IP addresses);

     o Decision Point address specify the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the 
       Decision Point. In this document this field MUST contain the IP 
       address of the Deaggregator.

     o "R": 1 bit flag that when set to ON, signifies, according to 
       [RFC6661] and [RFC6662], that the PCN-ingress-node (Aggregator) 
       MUST provide an estimate of the rate (PCN-sent-rate) at which the 
       PCN-ingress-node (Aggregator) is receiving PCN-traffic that is 
       destined for the given ingress-egress-aggregate.

     O "Reserved": 31 bits that are currently not used by this    
       document and are reserved. These SHALL be set to 0 and SHALL be 
       ignored on reception. 

     o PCN-sent-rate: the PCN-sent-rate for the given 
       ingress-egress-aggregate. It is expressed in octets/second; its 
       format is a 32-bit IEEE floating point number; The PCN-sent-rate 
       is specified in [RFC6661] and [RFC6662] and it represents the 
       estimate of the rate at which the PCN-ingress-node (Aggregator) 
       is receiving PCN-traffic that is destined for the given 
       ingress-egress-aggregate.

5.  Security Considerations 
    
   The security considerations specified in [RFC2205], [RFC4860] and
   [RFC5559] apply to this document.  In addition, [RFC4230] and
   [RFC6411] provide useful guidance on RSVP security mechanisms.

   Security within a PCN domain is fundamentally based on the controlled
   environment trust assumption stated in Section 6.3.1 of [RFC5559], in
   particular that all PCN-nodes are PCN-enabled and are trusted
   to perform accurate PCN-metering and PCN-marking.

   In the PCN domain environments addressed by this document, Generic
   Aggregate Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) messages specified in
   [RFC4860] are used for support of the PCN Controlled Load (CL) and
   Single Marking (SM) edge behaviors over a Diffserv cloud using Pre-
   Congestion Notification.  Hence the security mechanisms discussed
   in [RFC4860] are applicable.  Specifically, the INTEGRITY object
   [RFC2747][RFC3097] can be used to provide hop-by-hop RSVP message
   integrity, node authentication and replay protection, thereby
   protecting against corruption and spoofing of RSVP messages and
   PCN feedback conveyed by RSVP messages.

   For these reasons, this document does not introduce significant
   additional security considerations beyond those discussed in

Internet-Draft       Aggregated RSVP over PCN           October 2014    

   [RFC5559] and [RFC4860].

6.  IANA Considerations  
    
   IANA has modified the RSVP parameters registry, 'Class Names, 
   Class Numbers, and Class Types' subregistry, to add a new 
   Class Number and assign 4 new C-Types under this new Class 
   Number, as described below, see Section 4.1:

   Class
   Number  Class Name                                       Reference
   ------  ----------------------                           ---------
   248 PCN                                              this document

           Class Types or C-Types:
   1 RSVP-AGGREGATE-IPv4-PCN-request                    this document
   2 RSVP-AGGREGATE-IPv6-PCN-request                    this document
   3 RSVP-AGGREGATE-IPv4-PCN-response                   this document
   4 RSVP-AGGREGATE-IPv6-PCN-response                   this document

   When this draft is published as an RFC, IANA should update the 
   reference for the above 5 items to that published RFC (and the RFC 
   Editor should remove this sentence).

10. Appendix A:  Example Signaling Flow

   This appendix is based on the appendix provided in [RFC4860]. In 
   particular, it provides an example signaling flow of the 
   specification detailed in Section 3 and 4. 
   This signaling flow assumes an environment where E2E reservations are 
   aggregated over generic aggregate RSVP reservations and applied over 
   a PCN domain. In particular the Aggregator (PCN-ingress-node) and 
   Deaggregator (PCN-egress-node) are located at the boundaries of the 
   PCN domain. The PCN-interior-nodes are located within the PCN-domain, 
   between the PCN-boundary nodes, but are not shown in this Figure. It 
   illustrates a possible RSVP message flow that could take place in the 
   successful establishment of a unicast E2E reservation that is the 
   first between a given pair of Aggregator/Deaggregator.

   <-----------

   (1) The Aggregator forwards E2E Path into the aggregation region 
     after modifying its IP protocol number to RSVP-E2E-IGNORE

   (2) Let's assume no Aggregate Path exists.  To be able to accurately
       update the ADSPEC of the E2E Path, the Deaggregator needs the
       ADSPEC of Aggregate Path.  In this example, the Deaggregator
       elects to instruct the Aggregator to set up an Aggregate Path 
       state for the PCN PHB-ID.  To do that, the Deaggregator
       sends an E2E PathErr message with a New-Agg-Needed PathErr
       code.  

       The PathErr message also contains a SESSION-OF-INTEREST
       (SOI) object. The SOI contains a GENERIC-AGGREGATE SESSION 
       (GApcn) whose PHB-ID is set to the PCN PHB-ID. The GENERIC-
       AGGREGATE SESSION contains an interface-independent Deaggregator
       address inside the DestAddress and appropriate values inside the
       vDstPort and Extended vDstPort fields. In this document, the 
       Extended vDstPort SHOULD contain the IPv4 or IPv6 address of 
       the Aggregator.

   (3) The Aggregator follows the request from the Deaggregator and

Karagiannis, et al.   Expires April 6, 2015                [Page 27]

Internet-Draft       Aggregated RSVP over PCN           October 2014    

       signals an Aggregate Path for the GENERIC-AGGREGATE Session
       (GApcn).

   (4) The Deaggregator takes into account the information contained in
       the ADSPEC from both Aggregate Paths and updates the E2E Path
       ADSPEC accordingly. The PCN-egress-node MUST NOT perform the 
       RSVP-TTL vs IP TTL-check and MUST NOT update the ADspec Break 
       bit. This is because the whole PCN-domain is effectively handled 
       by E2E RSVP as a virtual link on which integrated service is 
       indeed supported (and admission control performed) so that the 
       Break bit MUST NOT be set, see also    
       [draft-lefaucheur-rsvp-ecn-01]. The Deaggregator also modifies 
       the E2E Path IP protocol number to RSVP before forwarding it.

   (5) In this example, the Deaggregator elects to immediately proceed
       with establishment of the generic aggregate reservation. In 
       effect, the Deaggregator can be seen as anticipating
       the actual demand of E2E reservations so that the generic 
       aggregate reservation is in place when the E2E Resv
       request arrives, in order to speed up establishment of E2E
       reservations. Here it is also assumed that the Deaggregator 
       includes the optional Resv Confirm Request in the Aggregate 
       Resv message.

   (6) The Aggregator merely complies with the received ResvConfirm
       Request and returns the corresponding Aggregate ResvConfirm. 

   (7) The Deaggregator has explicit confirmation that the generic 
       aggregate reservation is established.

   (8) On receipt of the E2E Resv, the Deaggregator applies the mapping
       policy defined by the network administrator to map the E2E Resv
       onto a generic aggregate reservation.  Let's assume that this
       policy is such that the E2E reservation is to be mapped onto the
       generic aggregate reservation with the PCN PHB-ID=x. The 
       Deaggregator knows that a generic aggregate reservation (GApcn) 
       is in place for the corresponding PHB-ID since (7).  At this step 
       the Deaggregator maps the generic aggregated reservation onto one 
       ingress-egress-aggregate maintained by the Deaggregator (as a 
       PCN-egress-node), see Section 3.7. The Deaggregator performs 
       admission control of the E2E Resv onto the generic Aggregate 
       reservation for the PCN PHB-ID (GApcn).  The Deaggregator takes 
       also into account the PCN admission control procedure as
       as specified in [RFC6661] and [RFC6662], see Section 3.7. 
       If one or both the admission control procedures (PCN based 
       admission control procedure and admission control procedure 
       specified in [RFC4860]) are not successful, then the E2E Resv is 
       not admitted onto the associated RSVP generic aggregate 
       reservation for the PCN PHB-ID (GApcn). Otherwise, assuming that 
       the generic aggregate reservation for the PCN (GApcn) had been 
       established with sufficient bandwidth to support the E2E Resv, 
       the Deaggregator adjusts its counter, tracking the unused 
       bandwidth on the generic aggregate reservation. Then it forwards 
       the E2E Resv to the Aggregator including a SESSION-OF-INTEREST

       object conveying the selected mapping onto GApcn (and hence onto 
       the PCN PHB-ID).

   (9) The Aggregator records the mapping of the E2E Resv onto GApcn 
       (and onto the PCN PHB-ID). The Aggregator removes the SOI object 
       and forwards the E2E Resv towards the sender.
