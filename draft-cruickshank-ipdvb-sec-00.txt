INTERNET DRAFT  Encapsulation for IP over MPEG-2/DVB         June 2005 
 
 
1. Introduction 
    
   This document describes an extension header for providing link-layer 
   security for the ULE [ULE] encapsulation which supports transport of 
   IP datagrams or other network layer packets over ISO MPEG-2 
   Transport Streams [ISO-MPEG]. 
    
   In MPEG-2 transmission networks employing ULE, there is a need to 
   provide link-layer (L2) security, particularly where network-layer 
   and transport-layer security (e.g. IPsec, TLS) may not be 
   sufficient. There are pros and cons for both IPsec and ULE security.   
    
   The major advantage of IPsec is its wide implementation in IP 
   routers and hosts.  The decision to use IPsec in transport mode is a 
   decision made by a specific pair of end-hosts. The use in tunnel 
   mode is a choice for the user/network operator. Tunnel mode may (and 
   sometimes is) used to provide security over particular types of link 
   (including MPEG-2 transmission links). However, there are overheads 
   associated with using IPsec in tunnel mode as a method to protect 
   such links. IPsec tunnel mode also does not provide security 
   services for other network protocols that may be used with ULE (e.g. 
   MPLS, Ethernet Bridging), requiring several methods to be 
   implemented. Another issue, that is important in some deployment 
   scenarios, is the need to protect the identity of end 
   users/Receivers over a broadcast medium; IPsec can not provide this 
   service. 
 
   ULE link security is therefore considered an additional security 
   mechanism to IP, transport, and application layer security, not a 
   replacement. It provides similar functions to that of IPsec [IPsec], 
   but in addition provides link confidentiality. End-to-end security, 
   IPsec and ULE link security can work in parallel:  IPSsec providing 
   end-to-end security between hosts and ULE providing security over 
   the MPEG-2 transmission link.  However, there is no direct 
   interaction between the IPsec [RFC2401,RFC2402, RFC2406] and the ULE 
   security system.  
    
   ULE may use and benefit from IETF key management protocols, such as 
   the MSEC GDOI [RFC3547, RFC 3547] and GSAKMP [msec-gsakmp].  This 
   does not preclude the use of other key management methods in 
   scenarios which benefit from this. A security analysis is provided 
   in the RFC describing the ipdvb architecture [ipdvb-arch]. 
    
   In some current encapsulation methods, e.g. MPE [DVB-DAT], 
   encryption of the MAC address requires each Receiver to decrypt all 
   encrypted data sent using a TS Logical Channel (PID), before it can 
   then filter the PDUs that matches the set of MAC/NPA addresses that 
   the Receiver wishes to receive, therefore encryption of the MPE MAC 
   address is not permitted in such systems. This document specifies a 
   mode that provides optional support for Layer 2 MAC/NPA address 
   encryption.

   To support optional link level encryption, an encryption extension 
   header is defined, and included in the SNDU payload. This approach 
   is generic and decouples the encapsulation from the evolution of 
   future security methods.  
    
   The proposed approach suggests a new ULE Mandatory Extension header 
   for a security association id (similar to the IPsec SPI [IPsec]). 
   Encryption algorithms, key lengths, etc. will be defined making use 
   of the standard IPsec suites [msec]. The focus is on providing 
   suitable link encryption.  Link layer data integrity is not 
   considered critical for ULE, because ULE provides a checksum 
   function, which covers several aspects of data integrity. However, 
   Link layer data integrity should be provided as an optional security 
   service, especially for systems where there are several ULE 
   transmitters (e.g. satellite meshed systems with On-Board 
   Processing) 
    
    
   The major advantages for ULE security are: 
    
   - The method does not preclude the use of IPsec. 
   - IPsec also provides a proven security architecture defining key 
     exchange mechanisms and the ability to use a range of 
     cryptographic algorithms. In some environments, the use of 
     specialist cryptos is seen as a positive advantage. 
   - The protection of the complete PDU including IP addresses and user 
     identity hiding [RFC 3819]. 
   - Ability to protect the identity of the Receiver within the MPEG-2 
     transmission newtwork.  This includes hiding the IPsec tunnel end-
     point and optionally the receiver L2 identity (MAC/NPA addresses). 
   - For packets that are not covered by IPsec, implementing security 
     at the ULE level provides transparency to the use of TCP 
     Performance Enhancing Proxies (PEP) [RFC3135], which require the 
     ability to inspect and modify the packets sent over the ULE link. 
     TCP PEPs are important to many currently deployed networks.  The 
     use of transport IPsec or client-controlled tunnel IPsec are not 
     compatible with the use of TCP PEPs.   
   - For packets that are not covered by IPsec, transparency to the use 
     of Network Address Translation (NATs), which require the ability 
     to inspect and modify the packets sent over the ULE link. 
   - Lower CPU processing (Receiver decryption is performed at each 
     destination L2 Receiver, instead of for each destination IP 
     address, where destination L2 Receiver may receive many IP 
     streams. 
    
    
1.1 Security requirements for IP over MPEG-2 TS 
    
   This subsection provides a brief overview of the threats to networks 
   that employ ULE and then derives the security requirements. 
    
   The simplest type of network threats are passive threats. Passive 
   attackers are involved in eavesdropping on, or monitoring of,

   transmissions, with a goal to obtain information that is being 
   transmitted. In broadcast networks (utilising widely available 
   physical layer interfaces, such as DVB) passive threats are 
   considered the major threats. 
    
   Active threats (or attacks) are, in general, more difficult to 
   implement successfully than passive threats, and usually require 
   more sophisticated resources and may require access to the 
   transmitter. Examples of active attacks are:  
     - Masquerading, where an entity pretends to be a different 
        entity.  This includes masquerading other users and subnetwork 
        control plane messages. 
     - Modification of messages in an unauthorised manner. 
     - Repudiation: Repudiation of origin occurs when a party denies 
        being the originator of a message and repudiation of 
        destination occurs when a party denies the reception of a 
        message. 
     - Denial of service attacks:  When an entity fails to perform its 
        proper function or acts in a way that prevents other entities 
        from performing their proper functions.  
    
   From the above analysis, the following security requirements can be 
   derived: 
     - End-to-end security (such as IPsec) and ULE link security 
        should work in parallel without obstructing each other. 
     - Data confidentiality is the major requirement against passive 
        threats (using encryption). 
     - Optional protection of Layer 2 MAC/NPA address. 
     - Layer L2 terminal authentication.  This will be part of the key 
        management.  It will be performed during the initial key 
        exchange and authentication phase. 
     - For active threats: Source authentication and data integrity 
        are required, using techniques such as message authentication 
        code and digital signatures.  Active threats can be considered 
        as minor threats in MPEG-02 transmission networks.  Therefore, 
        L2 data integrity/authentication is optional, but still 
        important in environments in which several independent networks 
        share a single transmission resource. 
     - Decoupling of ULE key management functions from ULE encryption.  
        This will allow the independent definition of these systems 
        such as the re-use of existing security management systems 
        (e.g. GDOI [RFC3547] and GSAKMP [msec-gsakmp]), plus other 
        systems such as DVB-RCS [ETSI-DVBRCS] and/or the development of 
        new systems, as required. 
     - Other general requirements are: 
          . Protection of the management system and the infrastructure 
            from unauthorised people. ULE encryption will provide 
            partial protection through the key management procedures 
            and data encryption. 
          . Traceability (such as using intrusion detection systems) to 
            monitor transmisison network (e.g. using log files to 
            record the activities on the network).  This is out of 
            scope for ULE security.

          . Operational issues: Because of the possible large coverage 
            of broadcast transmission network, it may be required to 
            deliver data to many different countries that may have 
            different security legislation (related to authorized 
            encryption algorithms and the length of keys). Therefore 
            the ULE security system should allow a wide range of 
            security parameters during the negotiation phase in order 
            to offer flexibility to operators.  In ULE security, the 
            choice of such algorithms will be decided by the key 
            management system in use. 
          . Compatibility with other networking functions: Other 
            networking functions such as NAT (Network Address 
            Translation) [RFC3715] or TCP acceleration can be used in a 
            wireless DVB networks. The ULE security solution should be 
            compatible with functions such as NAT/NAPT, IPsec, TLS, 
            etc.  This requirement is met by ULE security.

2. Link Security Protocol 
    
   This section describes the link security protocol for the ULE 
   protocol. 
    
    
2.1 Encryption of the SNDU payload 
    
   The security suite of algorithms for data encryption and data 
   integrity specified in IPsec/MSEC will be used for ULE security.  
  
   The SNDU padding must be used in order to make the SNDU length 
    as multiples of 8 or 16 byes depending on the type of encryption 
    algorithm used.

    Another issue is key space there is a need for two databases for 
    the correct processing on security in ULE Transmitters and Receivers:

    Ñ	Security Policy Database (SPD): This database contains the policies 
    that determine the processing of all ULE inbound/outbound traffic (such 
    as encrypting all outbound ULE traffic destined to a certain terminal). 
    Ñ	Security Association Database (SAD): Each entry defines the  
    parameters associated with one ULE-SID such as encryption keys.  Each 
    ULE-SID has an entry in the SAD.

   The main aim of this document is to re-use existing techniques in IPsec 
   architecture and therefore the SDP and SAD will follow the format of these 
 databases as defined in RFC 2401 [RFC2401].


2.2 Encryption Extension Header format 
 
   A ULE [ULE] encryption header extension is defined for use with any 
   ULE payload. This extension header MAY directly follow the ULE base 
   header (as illustrated in figures 1 and 2). It MAY also follow 
   another specified extension header. 
    
   The Encryption Extension is a Mandatory ULE Extension Header. This 
   means that a Receiver MUST either process this header, before it 
   processes the next header (or the enclosed PDU), otherwise the 
   entire SNDU is to be discarded. The first two bytes of the encrypted 
   data block contain a ULE Type field, defined by [ULE] that specifies 
   the type/extension header that follows.  
     
   This document defines one code-point for encryption headers. SNDUs 
   that are not encrypted, do NOT include this header. 
    
   [XXX IANA ACTION REQUIRED XXX] 
   IANA action is required to assign one code point from ULE Mandatory 
   Next-Layer-Header Registry.

   The ULE Security IDentifier (ULE-SID) is a 32 bit value. The ULE-SID 
   can be used by a Receiver to filter PDUs in conjunction with the set 
   of MAC/NPA addresses that it wishes to receive.  
    
   The format of the ULE-SID will be specified in this document. One 
   option for ULE-SID is to have a similar format to the Security 
   Parameter Index (SPI) used in IPSEC and MSEC protocols. 
    
   A second option is that it may contain two subfields: 
   . KeyID:  This tells the Receiver which key to use to decrypt the 
     current ULE packet. 
   . 23 bits MAC/NPA address (encrypted or open) 
    
   The combined value of both fields in the ULE-SID MUST be used to 
   filter ULE packets in the Receivers.   
 
   The extension MAY be used with PDUs that carry a NPA/MAC address 
   (D=0) or with PDUs that omit this field (D=0). In the latter case, a 
   Receiver of an encrypted ULE PDU will not carry a NPA/MAC. 
 
   If the MAC/NPA address is encrypted, then the key management system 
   is responsible for generating this temporary MAC/NPA address.  
   Temporary MAC/NPA address will change from time to time depending on 
   the security policy and it is not directly related to each ULE 
   session. It can change periodically (for example after a specified 
   period of time and/or after a specified volume of traffic has been 
   sent to that terminal).  The impact of such a design is that each 
   Receiver and the Network Control Centre (NCC) will use two MAC/NPA 
   addresses when filtering: one for unencrypted traffic and the second 
   Temporary value for secure traffic. This rule will apply to both 
   unicast and multicast connections.

3 Key Exchange Procedure  
    
   This section describes the key exchange procedure, used to install 
   and manage the keys at Receivers.  There is a need to take into 
   account the two cases described in [ipdvb-arch], both: 
   unidirectional and bi-directional transfers.  
    
   The key management procedures are independent from the ULE 
   operations. During the key exchange procedure, the ULE-SID will be 
   defined.  The ULE-SID is one link between ULE and the security 
   systems.  The other link is the temporary MAC/NPA address. 
  
   The exact data encryption and data integrity choices are linked to 
   the key management systems in use.  One example is the security 
   suite 1 (defined in GSAKMP [msec-gsakmp]).  This uses AES (CBC mode, 
   Key Length: 128 bits) for data encryption and DSS-ASN1-DER for digital
   signature and SHA-1 as the Hash algorithm.  Other suites will be added
   in future versions.
   
   A detailed key management system is not presented in this document, 
   but two approaches are outlined in this section. 
    
 
3.1 IPsec Key Management for L2 
    
   Existing key management systems can be used such as the MSEC key 
   exchange protocols, GDOI and GSAKMP [RFC3547 and msec-gsakmp]. The 
   format of the ULE-SID will be identical in format to the security 
   association as defined in GDOI or GSAKMP. The initial key exchange 
   between the security server (which may reside with NCC) and the ULE 
   Receiver can be transported either within the ULE network or may be 
   performed by some other means.  This is a matter of policy and an 
   architecture decision.  For example, for bi-directional transfers 
   the whole key exchange procedures could be carried within the ULE 
   network, while for unidirectional transfers, some other 
   bidirectional connection should be used. 
    
    
3.2 Alternative Key Management  
    
   The method described is a general method for link encryption and 
   could be used with alternative key management systems when used as a 
   part of a system that already implements a key management 
   infrastructure (e.g. the DVB-RCS security system [ETSI-DVBRCS]). The 
   format of the ULE-SID will be the same format as defined in DVB-RCS 
   security procedures.

4. Summary 
    
   This document proposes a security framework for a layer 2 security 
   method designed for the Unidirectional-Lightweight Encapsulation 
   (ULE) protocol. It provides threat analysis and defines the 
   requirements for ULE security. It also proposes an extension format 
   for the Unidirectional-Lightweight Encapsulation (ULE) protocol.  
    
   The key management for this protocol may be performed using IPsec 
   methods such as the msec gsakmp and gdoi protocols, or using other 
   methods not defined in this document.

5. Security Considerations 
 
   Link-level (L2) encryption of IP traffic is commonly used in 
   broadcast/radio links to supplement End-to-End security (e.g. 
   provided by TLS, SSH, Open PGP, S/MIME, IPsec). A common objective 
   is to provide the same level of privacy as terrestrial links. An ISP 
   or User may also wish to provide end-to-end security services to the 
   end-users (based on the well known mechanisms such as IPsec). 
    
   This document defines a method to provide optional link encryption. 
   The method may also support optional link level integrity / 
   authentication of the SNDU payload.  
    
   This is provided in a flexible way using a ULE Mandatory Extension 
   Header. This decouples specification of the security functions from 
   the encapsulation functions. This method also supports encryption of 
   the NPA/MAC addresses.  The encryption and integrity algorithms are 
   similar to the ones used in IPSEC/MSEC protocols.
