Internet-Draft     Response Codes for Path Redundancy      February 2007


Abstract

   An increasing number of SIP architectures implement multiple path
   routing (MPR), which is the providing of more than one path for a
   call to reach a destination user agent (UA).  To implement MPR well,
   the proxy which forks a request onto the paths needs to be able to
   determine if a fork that failed reached the destination UA and was
   rejected by the UA (and so an alternate path should not be tried), or
   if the fork failed before reaching the UA (and so an alternate path
   should be attempted).  In order that the proxy can distinguish these
   two situations, response codes should unambiguously identify which of
   these situations applies.  This Internet-Draft begins classifying the
   current usage of response codes, their implications for MPR, and
   possible improvements.

Internet-Draft     Response Codes for Path Redundancy      February 2007


1.  Background

   An increasing number of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [1] system
   architectures implement multiple path routing (MPR), the feature of
   providing more than one path for a call to reach a destination user
   agent (UA).  (MPR is also called path redundancy (PR) or alternate
   path retry (APR).)  Typical situations are:

   o  multiple gateway devices that connect a SIP network to the PSTN,
      such that if one gateway is occupied to capacity, calls should be
      routed to the next gateway

   o  a PSTN gateway device as fallback when SIP connection over the
      Internet fails

   o  sending a request to multiple services that determine how to reach
      a destination, with an order of precedence as to which service is
      to be used (e.g., connecting to an ENUM contact, falling back to a
      PSTN gateway)

   From a protocol point of view, a proxy is presented with the
   situation where a request (typically an INVITE) should be serially
   forked to more than one SIP URI, and from an application-layer point
   of view, all of the URIs are expected to ultimately reach the same
   user agent (UA).  (Here we assume the proxy knows that this is the
   situation.  How the proxy does so is beyond the scope of this
   document.  Also beyond the scope of this document is the question of
   when two destinations are considered "the same".)  Of course, if one
   fork of the request succeeds, the proxy should not attempt any
   further forks.  But if a request fails, in order to know whether to
   attempt any further forks, the proxy needs to know if the request
   succeeded in reaching the destination UA or not.

   If the request did not reach the destination UA, then in order
   implement MPR, the proxy must attempt the next fork.  But if the
   request did reach the destination UA, and the UA returned a failure
   response, sending the request to the same UA via a different path is
   unlikely to yield success, and may even degrade the user experience.
   For example, if the first request was not accepted by the attending
   human (Ring-No-Answer), sending a second request to the UA by a
   different path, which will cause the UA to alert again, is not the
   desired behavior.

   Ideally, in order that the proxy can distinguish these cases, each
   final response code should identify whether the request was rejected
   by the UA or an intermediate agent, or equivalently, whether the
   request reached the destination UA or not.  (There are also some
   special cases when a failure response is returned by an intermediate

   agent, but MPR should not be attempted.)  This Internet-Draft begins
   classifying the current usage of response codes and their
   implications for MPR, and begins suggesting improvements to the
   system of response codes.

   Initially, this document is intended as a statement of current
   practice and a discussion of the implications of supporting MPR.  It
   should evolve into a statement of best common practice.  If problems
   with the existing semantics of responses are discovered, it may
   evolve into a draft standard that updates the semantics of response
   codes.

2.  What Is a Final Response?

   First, we need to clarify what is meant by a "final response" for MPR
   purposes.  For implementing MPR, a final response is one which is the
   result of the proxy's actions in attempting to reach a particular
   target URI in the set of redundant targets.  A final response is
   always the "best response" chosen from the set of responses from the
   set forks generated while attempting to reach one of the target URI.
   It is this response that is examined to determine whether to attempt
   the next target URI of the set of redundant URIs.

   (We note that the proxy might have the set of redundant targets
   contained as a sub-set within a set of non-redundant targets for the
   incoming request-URI.  That case is harder to keep straight in one's
   mind, but it is handled in the straightforward way: The proxy
   proceeds through the sub-sets using the MPR rules, but when moving
   from one sub-set to the next, it terminates when it receives a
   success response and continues when it receives a failure response.)

   Redirection (3xx) responses are final if they are considered for
   being returned as the "best response" to an incoming request, that
   is, if the proxy will not act on the 3xx response to generate further
   forks whose responses are to be put in the response set.  But if the
   proxy will act on the 3xx to generate new forks in place of the
   original target URI, the 3xx is not put into the response set and
   will not become a final response -- Rather, the final responses of
   the new forks are added to the response set to produce the final
   response for the target URI.  Whether the proxy chooses to act on a
   3xx response ("recurse on a redirect response") or to consider it
   final for its fork is a matter of local policy.  (But implementors
   should be aware of the requirement of section 16.5 of [1] to not
   recurse on a 3xx response unless the incoming request-URI was for a
   domain that the proxy "is responsible for".)

   A proxy is sometimes permitted to act on a 416 (Unsupported URI
   Scheme) response by rewriting the request-URI into a sip: or sips:
   URI and acting on that new URI.  (See section 16.7 of [1].)  In such
   as case, the 416 is treated in the same way as a 3xx.  But if the 416
   does not trigger rewriting, it is added to the response set and may
   become the final response.

3.  Response Codes

   The following enumeration of response codes was taken from the IANA
   registry (http://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters) on 31 Jan
   2007.

3.1.  400 Bad Request

   The 400 response is used by an agent to report that a request is
   malformed.  This indicates positive knowledge on the part of the
   agent that the request is malformed (and not that the agent has
   detected an an extension that it cannot understand).  Hence, MPR
   should not be attempted on the request.  (This is an example of a
   failure that suppresses MPR, but is not from a destination UA.)

3.2.  401 Unauthorized

   The 401 response is used by a UA to report that the request is not
   adequately authorized to be processed, but if the UAC provides
   authorization, the request might be processable.  Since an MPR fork
   will presumably be met with the same authorization requirement, MPR
   should not be attempted.  Instead, the 401 should be returned to the
   UAC, which should retry the request with authorization.

3.3.  402 Payment Required

   The 402 response is reserved for further standardization.  However,
   in regard to MPR, it is likely that it will prove useful to separate
   this response into two response codes, "UAS Payment Required" and
   "Transport Payment Required".

3.4.  403 Forbidden

   The 403 response is used by a UAS to indicate that it will not carry
   out the requested operation, even if provided with credentials.  MPR
   should not be attempted.

3.5.  404 Not Found

   The 404 response is used to indicate that an agent had positive
   knowledge that the request-URI presented to it does not exist.
   However, since the UAC has no way to know what request-URI was
   presented, this assertion of positive knowledge has limited
   usefulness.  Because the 404 response is relative to the routing of a
   particular fork of the request, MPR should be attempted.

Internet-Draft     Response Codes for Path Redundancy      February 2007


3.6.  405 Method Not Allowed

   Since all well-behaved proxies do not filter requests based on
   method, 405 responses should only be generated by destination UAs.
   Hence, MPR should not be attempted for 405 responses.

3.7.  406 Not Acceptable

   The 406 response is used by UAs to reject a request because they
   cannot service any of the media formats listed in the Accept header.
   406 responses should only be generated by destination UAs.  Hence,
   MPR should not be attempted for 406 responses.

3.8.  407 Proxy Authentication Required

   The 407 response is like the 401 response, but it is generated by
   proxies and gateways to demand authentication before allowing access
   to a transport resource.  Since the 407 response is relative to the
   transport path, MPR should be attempted for 407 responses.

3.9.  408 Request Timeout

   The 408 response is used by a SIP agent to report or describe that
   its attempt to contact the next agent downstream failed with no
   response.  Since the 408 response is always a transport error, MPR
   should be attempted for 408 responses.

   Note that 408 is not used by a UAS to report a Ring-No-Answer
   condition.  The limitation of ringing time is described to the UAS by
   an Expires header in the INVITE, but the termination of the INVITE is
   done by an upstream agent sending a CANCEL.  See [1] section 13.2.1.
   So the response generated by Ring-No-Answer is 487.  (See
   Section 3.33.

3.10.  410 Gone

   The 410 response, like the 404 response, is relative to the request-
   URI that is in the request when it reaches the agent generating the
   response, and so is transport-dependent.  Hence, MPR should be
   attempted for 410 responses.

3.11.  412 Conditional Request Failed

   The 412 response [3] is used by a destination UA to indicate that the
   request cannot be processed because UA does not have information
   which is a precondition for successfully processing the request.
   Hence, MPR should not be attempted for 412 responses.

Internet-Draft     Response Codes for Path Redundancy      February 2007


3.12.  413 Request Entity Too Large

   According to [1] section 21.4.11, the 413 response is generated only
   by destination a UAS to indicate that it cannot process the body of
   the request.  Hence, MPR should not be attempted for 413 responses.

3.13.  414 Request-URI Too Long

   According to [1] section 21.4.12, the 414 response is generated only
   by destination a UAS to indicate that the request-URI is longer than
   it can process.  The request-URI of a request can depend on the path
   by which the request reached the UAS, but it not expected in practice
   that the request-URI seen by the UAS (almost always one of its
   contact URIs) will be different in an MPR fork.  Hence, MPR should
   not be attempted for 414 responses.

3.14.  415 Unsupported Media Type

   According to [1] section 21.4.13, the 415 response is generated only
   by destination a UAS to indicate that it cannot process the body of
   the request.  Hence, MPR should not be attempted for 415 responses.

3.15.  416 Unsupported URI Scheme

   According to [1] section 21.4.14, the 416 response is generated only
   by destination a UAS to indicate that the request-URI has a scheme
   that the UAS does not support The request-URI of a request can depend
   on the path by which the request reached the UAS, but it not expected
   in practice that the request-URI seen by the UAS will be different in
   an MPR fork.  Hence, MPR should not be attempted for 416 responses.

3.16.  417 Unknown Resource-Priority

   The 417 response [4] means that an actor did not understand the
   Resource-Priority header.  Since the Resource-Priority header
   controls access to transport resources, an MPR fork may avoid the
   problem, and so MPR should be attempted.

3.17.  420 Extension Not Supported

   The 420 response means that an actor did not support an extension
   that was named in a Require or Proxy-Require header.  If the failure
   was due to Proxy-Require, MPR should be attempted.  If the failure
   was due to Require, MPR should not be attempted.  Unfortunately,
   these two conditions cannot be distinguished, which indicates that it
   is desirable to create a new response code for one of these cases.

Internet-Draft     Response Codes for Path Redundancy      February 2007


3.18.  421 Extension Required

   The 421 response is used by a UAS to indicate that a response to the
   request cannot be generated without using an extension that is not
   listed in the Supported header of the request.  Since the response is
   only generated by a UAS, MPR should not be attempted.

3.19.  422 Session Interval Too Small

   The 422 response [5] can be generated with by a UAS or by a proxy, so
   it is not possible to determine whether to attempt MPR or not.  It is
   desirable that a new response code is defined for one of these
   situations.

3.20.  423 Interval Too Brief

   The 423 response is generated by a registrar in response to a
   REGISTER request.  Hence, MPR should never be attempted for 423
   responses.

3.21.  428 Use Identity Header

   The 428 response, along with the 436, 437, and 438 responses, are
   generated by a SIP agent acting as a verifier [2].  Since the
   invocation of the verifier can depend on the transport path of the
   request, MPR should be attempted for these responses.

3.22.  429 Provide Referrer Identity

   The 429 response [6] is used by UA that is a referee or a refer-
   target to demand that the REFER or the REFER-generated request
   contain a Referred-By header.  Hence, MPR should not be attempted for
   a 429 response.

3.23.  436 Bad Identity-Info

   See Section 3.21.

3.24.  437 Unsupported Certificate

   See Section 3.21.

3.25.  438 Invalid Identity Header

   See Section 3.21.

Internet-Draft     Response Codes for Path Redundancy      February 2007


3.26.  480 Temporarily Unavailable

   The 480 response is used to indicate various conditions which prevent
   the user from being contacted, but which may change with time.  These
   conditions include "no UA registered for this AOR" and "do not
   disturb".  Unfortunately, for transport-related errors like "no UA
   registered for this AOR", MPR would be helpful, but for end-user
   conditions like "do not disturb", MPR would not be helpful.  So this
   response code should be split into two response codes.

3.27.  481 Call/Transaction Does Not Exist

   The 481 response is used by UAs to indicate that handling the request
   requires the existence of a referenced dialog, but the UA has no
   knowledge of such a dialog.  This response is used to reject apparent
   within-dialog requests for which the necessary dialog does not exist,
   or for which the necessary dialog usage does not exist within the
   dialog.  In addition, it is used to reject a CANCEL request which
   does not match a current transaction.  In all of these cases, MPR is
   of no use.

3.28.  482 Loop Detected

   The 482 response indicates that an agent has discovered a loop in
   request routing.  Since an MPR fork might travel over a route that
   does not lead into a loop, MPR should be attempted for 482 responses.

3.29.  483 Too Many Hops

   The 483 response indicates that an agent has discovered a loop in
   request routing via exhaustion of the Max-Forwards count.  Since an
   MPR fork might travel over a route that does not lead into a loop,
   MPR should be attempted for 483 responses.

3.30.  484 Address Incomplete

   The 484 response is returned to a UAC only by an originating proxy
   which is cooperating with the UAC to accumulate a dial string.  Since
   such processing does not admit MPR processing, the MPR forking
   decision will never be presented with a 484 response.

3.31.  485 Ambiguous

   The 485 response indicates that a SIP agent could not determine how
   to resolve an ambiguous request-URI.  Like all responses commenting
   on a request-URI, it is path-dependent, and so MPR should be
   attempted for this response.

3.32.  486 Busy Here

   The 486 response is used by a UAS to indicate that it or its user is
   busy and so cannot accept another INVITE at this time. (486 is also
   used to indicate a Do-Not-Disturb condition.)  MPR should not be
   attempted on a 486 response.

3.33.  487 Request Terminated

   The 487 response is used to indicate that a request has been
   prematurely terminated because the UAC or agent received a CANCEL
   request before the request was fully processed.  This can result from
   the UAC canceling the request, a destination proxy canceling a
   request to a UA because of Ring-No-Answer, or (slightly outside of
   the standard) a UA rejecting a request due to Ring-No-Answer.  In any
   case, MPR would not help the situation.

   Unfortunately, RFC 3261 leaves a UAS no proper response to report
   that it terminated an unanswered INVITE on its own, as the 487
   response is supposed to be generated only when a CANCEL is received
   for an INVITE.  In addition, the same response code is used if the
   UAC cancels an INVITE as if the destination proxy cancels a Ring-No-
   Answer call, which works against coherent call processing logic.  For
   protocol cleanliness, it would be desirable to define a "Ring No
   Answer" 4xx response.  However, MPR should not be tried either for
   requests that are canceled by the UAS or requests that met with Ring-
   No-Answer, and so, strictly speaking, no additional response code is
   needed to support MPR.

3.34.  488 Not Acceptable Here

   The 488 response is used by a UAS to indicate that the proposed
   session offer in an INVITE is unacceptable.  Hence, MPR forking
   should not be tried for a 488 response.

3.35.  489 Bad Event

   The 489 response [7] is used by a UAS to indicate that it does not
   implement the Event header in a SUBSCRIBE request.  Hence, MPR
   forking should not be tried for a 489 request.

3.36.  491 Request Pending

   The 491 response is used by a UAS to reject a re-INVITE which it
   received while it has an INVITE request outstanding on the dialog.
   Since 491 can only be returned within-dialog, MPR forking never
   applies.

3.37.  493 Undecipherable

   The 493 response indicates that the UAS cannot decrypt the request.
   Hence, MPR forking should not be attempted.

3.38.  494 Security Agreement Required

   The 494 response [8] is used by a SIP agent to tell the UAC what
   security mechanisms it supports.  Since it depends on the transport
   path, MPR forking should be attempted for 494 responses.

3.39.  500 Server Internal Error

   The 500 response code is used by SIP agents to report a number of
   error conditions, some of them intrinsic to the request, and others
   internal to the agent:

   o  failure of an otherwise valid request due to an internal error
      ([1] section 10.3)

   o  a request has a CSeq value less than the highest CSeq received
      previously ([1] section 12.2.2 and 14.2)

   o  a proxy received only 503 responses to a request, but the proxy
      itself is capable of processing further requests ([1] section
      16.7)

   The first two cases are discovered by UAs, and MPR would be no help.
   But (since 503 responses are in practice always generated by proxies)
   the final case is a path-dependent failure of a proxy, and MPR should
   be attempted.  Thus, it would help if the 500 response code was split
   into two codes.

3.40.  501 Not Implemented

   The 501 response, like the similar 405 response, should never be
   generated by a proxy, and so MPR should not be attempted for it.

3.41.  502 Bad Gateway

   The 502 response is used by a proxy or gateway to indicate that it
   received an invalid response from a downstream agent.  Thus, this
   response is path-dependent, and MPR should be attempted for it.

3.42.  503 Service Unavailable

   From RFC 3261 [1] section 21.5.4:

Internet-Draft     Response Codes for Path Redundancy      February 2007


      A client (proxy or UAC) receiving a 503 (Service Unavailable)
      SHOULD attempt to forward the request to an alternate server.

   Thus, MPR should be attempted for 503 responses.

3.43.  504 Server Time-out

   Like the 502 response, the 504 response is path-dependent, and so MPR
   should be attempted for it.

3.44.  505 Version Not Supported

   Like the 501 response, the 505 response is path-dependent, and so MPR
   should be attempted for it.

3.45.  513 Message Too Large

   Like the 502 response, the 513 response is path-dependent, and so MPR
   should be attempted for it.

3.46.  580 Precondition Failure

   A 580 response [9] is generated by a server to indicate that it is
   unwilling to meet the preconditions in an SDP offer.  Thus, MPR
   should not be attempted for it.

3.47.  6xx

   All 6xx responses request termination of all forking for the request,
   and a fortiori, prevent any attempt at MPR.

   (Since an automated agent cannot reliably determine the original
   source of the request (which may have been forwarded from one AOR to
   another several times), 6xx responses are NOT RECOMMENDED, and if
   used, should only be generated by a UA under direct instruction from
   a user (or a user-specified policy).)

4.  Ambiguous Response Codes

   The following response codes are defined in ways which prevents a
   proxy from determining whether it should attempt multiple path
   routing or not.  Ideally, their function should be split into two
   different response codes, one for to be generated by proxies (for
   which MPR should be attempted) and one to be generated by UAs (for
   which MPR should not be attempted).

   402  The 402 response will (presumably) be used to request that
      payment information be provided, in much the same way that 401/407
      is used to request that authentication credentials be presented.
      But the 402 response does not distinguish between whether payment
      is demanded for transport or for UA access.

   420  The 420 response code is used to report that a proxy or UAS does
      not support an extension listed in a Require or Proxy-Require
      header.  But it does not distinguish whether a proxy or UAS is
      rejecting the request.

   422  The 422 response code is used to report that a session timer
      interval is considered too small by a proxy or UAS.  But it does
      not distinguish whether a proxy or UAS is rejecting the request.

   480  The 480 response code is used to report various conditions which
      prevent the user from being contacted, but which may change with
      time.  These conditions include "no UA registered for this AOR"
      and "do not disturb".  But it does not distinguish transport-
      related conditions from UA (or end-user) conditions.

   487  The 487 response can be the response from a request canceled by
      the UAC or the result of a Ring-No-Answer condition.  For protocol
      cleanliness, it would be helpful to split Ring-No-Answer from
      other uses of 487, and to allow a UAS to spontaneously time out an
      INVITE with a a Ring-No-Answer response.

   500  The 500 response code is used to report UA-related errors, as
      well as when a request could not reach its destination because
      intermediate agents were overloaded.  For MPR, it would be helpful
      to split the latter condition into a separate response code.

5.  Security Considerations

   Alternate path retry presents no security considerations that are
   known to the author beyond what is present in non-MPR SIP system
   architectures.
