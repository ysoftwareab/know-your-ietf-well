1.  Introduction

   This document defines a base YANG [RFC6020] data module for Quality
   of Service (QoS) configuration and operational parameters.
   Differentiated Services (DiffServ) module is an augmentation of the
   base QoS model.  Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) or notification
   definition is currently not part of this document and will be added
   later if necessary.  QoS base modules define a basic building blocks
   to define a classifier, policy, action and target.  The base modules
   have been augmented to include packet match fields, action
   parameters, and statistics data to define the DiffServ module.  It is
   left up to individual vendors to stitch actions like queues, random-
   detect (RED) and vendor specific parameters of the DiffServ policy
   definitions.  Designing the module in this manner allows for a very
   flexible and extensible module that should fit in with most of the
   vendor requirements.  The DiffServ model is based on DiffServ
   architecture, and various references have been made to available
   standard architecture documents.

   DiffServ is a preferred approach for network service providers to
   offer services to different customers based on their network Quality-

   of-Service (QoS) objectives.  The traffic streams are differentiated
   based on DiffServ Code Points (DSCP) carried in the IP header of each
   packet.  The DSCP markings are applied by upstream node or by the
   edge router on entry to the DiffServ network.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  QoS Model Design

   A classifier consists of packets which may be grouped when a logical
   set of rules are applied on different packet header fields.  The
   grouping may be based on different values or range of values of same
   packet header field, presence or absence of some values or range of
   values of a packet field or a combination thereof.  The QoS
   classifier is defined in the ietf-qos-classifier module.

   A classifier entry contains one or more packet conditioning
   functions.  A packet conditioning function is typically based on
   direction of traffic and may drop, mark or delay network packets.  A
   set of classifier entries with corresponding conditioning functions
   when arranged in order of priority represents a QoS policy.  A QoS
   policy may contain one or more classifier entries.  These are defined
   in ietf-qos-policy module.

   Actions are configured in line with respect to the policy module.
   These include marking, dropping or shaping.  Actions are defined in
   the ietf-qos-action module.

   A meter qualifies if the traffic arrival rate is based on agreed upon
   rate and variability.  A meter is modeled based on commonly used
   alogrithms in industry, Single Rate Tri Color Marking (srTCM)
   [RFC2697] meter, Two Rate Tri Color Marking (trTCM) [RFC2698] meter,
   and Single Rate Two Color Marking meter.  Different vendors can
   extend it with other types of meters as well.

4.  DiffServ Model Design

   DiffServ architecture [RFC3289] and [RFC2475] describe the
   architecture as a simple model where traffic entering a network is
   classified and possibly conditioned at the boundary of the network
   and assigned a different Behavior Aggregate (BA).  Each BA is
   identified by a specific value of DSCP, and is used to select a Per
   Hop Behavior (PHB).

Internet-Draft             YANG Model For QoS                  June 2017


   The packet classification policy identifies the subset of traffic
   which may receive a DiffServ by being conditioned or mapped.  Packet
   classifiers select packets within a stream based on the content of
   some portion of the packet header.  There are two types of
   classifiers, the BA classifier, and the Multi-Field (MF) classifier
   which selects packets based on a value which is combination of one or
   more header fields.  In the ietf-diffserv module, this is realized by
   augmenting the QoS classification module.

   Traffic conditioning includes metering, shaping and/or marking.  A
   meter is used to measure the traffic against a given traffic profile.
   The traffic profile specifies the temporal property of the traffic.
   A packet that arrives is first determined to be in or out of the
   profile, which will result in the action of marked, dropped or
   shaped.  This is realized in vendor specific modules based on the
   parameters defined in action module.  The metering parameters are
   augmented to the QoS policy module when metering is defined inline,
   and to the metering template when metering profile is referred in
   policy module.

   Finally, statistics are realized in the ietf-diffserv module by
   augmenting the QoS target module.

5.  Modules Tree Structure

   This document defines five YANG modules - four QoS base modules and
   one DiffServ module.

   ietf-qos-classifier consists of classifier entries identified by a
   classifier entry name.  Each entry MAY contain a list of filter
   entries.  When no filter entry is present in a classifier entry, it
   matches all traffic.

   module: ietf-qos-classifier
      +--rw classifiers
         +--rw classifier-entry* [classifier-entry-name]
            +--rw classifier-entry-name                string
            +--rw classifier-entry-descr?              string
            +--rw classifier-entry-filter-operation?   identityref
            +--rw filter-entry* [filter-type filter-logical-not]
               +--rw filter-type           identityref
               +--rw filter-logical-not    boolean


   An ietf-qos-policy module contains list of policy objects identified
   by a policy name and policy type which MUST be provided.  With
   different values of policy types, each vendor MAY define their own
   construct of policy for different QoS functionalities.  Each vendor

   MAY augment classifier entry in a policy definition with a set of
   actions.

         +--rw policy-entry* [policy-name policy-type]
            +--rw policy-name         string

               +--rw classifier-action-entry-cfg* [action-type]
                  +--rw action-type    identityref
                  +--rw (action-cfg-params)?


   ietf-qos-action module contains grouping of set of QoS actions.
   These include metering, marking, dropping and shaping.  Marking sets
   DiffServ codepoint value in the classified packet.  Color-aware and
   Color-blind meters are augmented by vendor specific modules based on
   the parameters defined in action module.

   module: ietf-qos-action

   ietf-qos-target module contains reference of qos-policy and augments
   ietf-interfaces [RFC7223] module.  A single policy of a particular
   policy-type can be applied on an interface in each direction of
   traffic.  Policy-type is of type identity and is populated in a
   vendor specific manner.  This way it provides greater flexibility for
   each vendor to define different policy types each with its own
   capabilities and restrictions.

   Classifier, metering and queuing counters are associated with a
   target.

   Diffserv module augments QoS classifier module.  Many of the YANG
   types defined in [RFC6991] are represented as leafs in the classifier
   module.

   Metering and marking actions are realized by augmenting the QoS
   policy-module.  Any queuing, AQM and scheduling actions are part of
   vendor specific augmentation.  Statistics are realized by augmenting
   the QoS target module.

Appendix A.  Company A, Company B and Company C examples

   Company A, Company B and Company C Diffserv modules augments all the
   filter types of the QoS classifier module as well as the QoS policy
   module that allow it to define marking, metering, min-rate, max-rate
   actions.  Queuing and metering counters are realized by augmenting of
   the QoS target module.

A.1.  Example of Company A Diffserv Model

   The following Company A vendor example augments the qos and diffserv
   model, demonstrating some of the following functionality:

   - use of template based classifier definitions

   - use of single policy type modelling queue, scheduler policy, and a
   filter policy.  All of these policies either augment the qos policy
   or the diffserv modules

   - support of hierarchial policy.

   - use of inline actions in a policy

   - flexibility in marking dscp or metadata at ingress and/or egress.

   - use of inline classifier definitions (defined inline in the policy
   vs referencing an externally defined classifier)

   - use of mulitple policy types, e.g. a queue policy, a scheduler
   policy, and a filter policy.  All of these policies either augment
   the qos policy or the diffserv modules

   - use of a queue module, which uses and extends the queue grouping
   from the ietf-qos-action module

   - use of meter templates (v.s. meter inline)

   - use of internal meta data for classification and marking

A.3.  Example of Company C Diffserv Model

   Company C vendor augmentation is based on Ericsson's implementation
   differentiated QoS.  This implementation first sorts traffic based on
   a classifier, which can sort traffic into one or more traffic
   forwarding classes.  Then, a policer or meter policy references the
   classifier and its traffic forwarding classes to specify different
   service levels for each traffic forwarding class.

   Because each classifier sorts traffic into one or more traffic
   forwarding classes, this type of classifier does not align with ietf-
   qos-classifier.yang, which defines one traffic forwarding class per
   classifier.  Additionally, Company C's policing and metering policies
   relies on the classifier's pre-defined traffic forwarding classes to
   provide differentiated services, rather than redefining the patterns
   within a policing or metering policy, as is defined in ietf-
   diffserv.yang.

   Due to these differences, even though Company C uses all the building
   blocks of classifier and policy, Company C's augmentation does not
   use ietf-diffserv.yang to provide differentiated service levels.
   Instead, Company C's augmentation uses the basic building blocks,
   ietf-qos-policy.yang to provide differentiated services.
