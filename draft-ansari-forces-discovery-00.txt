   Element bindings discovery: Mechanism that determines the CE/FE 
   bindings ¡ i.e. which FE is controlled by which CE and vice-versa. 
   The bindings also provide information such as whether the CE will 
   act as a primary or as a secondary controller. Once the bindings are 
   discovered, capabilities of the respective elements are exchanged. 
   This represents the first phase of the discovery protocol. The 
   result of this phase causes the FEs to maintain partial topology 
   (neighbors) information. 
    
   Inter-FE topology discovery: Topology discovery relates to how the 
   FEs are interconnected with each other with respect to packet 
   forwarding.  This  represents  the  second  phase  of  the  discovery

   protocol. This is the complete view of the intra-NE network as seen 
   by the CE. 
 
  Inter-FE topology maintenance: Once the inter-FE topology has been 
  discovered, it has to be continuously monitored to ensure that any 
  changes to the topology are reported to the corresponding CE. This 
  represents the steady state and final phase of the protocol. 
   
   
2. Introduction 
 
   The ForCES framework document [RFC 3746] describes how a set of 
   control elements (CEs) and forwarding elements (FEs) interact with 
   each other to form a single network element (NE). It describes the 
   ForCES  post-association  phase  protocol  working  across  the  Fp 
   reference point between CE and FE. However, it pre-supposes that the 
   process of discovering the CE/FE bindings and determining element 
   capabilities is already performed by some other mechanism during the 
   pre-association phase. Further, a normal NE operation requires that 
   the CEs have a continuous and consistent view of the inter-FE 
   topology. This document is meant to address these requirements for 
   proper NE operation. 
    
   We describe a protocol, called the ôdiscovery protocolö, which has 
   three distinct modes or phases. Phase one, is the CE/FE bindings 
   discovery  process,  wherein  the  elements  learn  of  each  otherÆs 
   existence and determine the respective bindings, capabilities and 
   appropriate interface to use for communication with each other. 
   Phase two is the inter-FE topology discovery process, wherein the CE 
   determines the complete inter-FE/intra-NE topology of the FE network 
   along with any additional capabilities. The third and final phase is 
   the topology maintenance phase, wherein any changes to the inter-FE 
   topology during normal operation is reported to the CE so that it 
   can update its view and make any necessary changes to the forwarding 
   tables to reroute packets. Phase one of the protocol, viz. the 
   elements binding discovery occurs during the pre-association phase, 
   while the topology discovery and maintenance phases occur during the 
   post-association phase of the ForCES protocol. 
 
   The proposed discovery protocol is required to scale to a very large 
   number of forwarding elements in the NE, with minimal impact on the 
   resources. The following list provides some of the features and 
   goals of the protocol. 
    
   . Determine appropriate CE-FE bindings 
   . Determine respective element capabilities 
   . Determine connectivity between elements 
   . React to changes in link connectivity

   . Construct topology information from the collected partial topology 
     information 
   . Tolerant to protocol message losses 
   . Operate independently from the ForCES protocol across the Fp 
     reference point in the pre-association phase 
   . Applicable to all inter-FE network topologies such as ring, mesh, 
     star etc. 
   . Cause minimal overhead 
   . Agnostic of the network interconnect technology 
    
2.1. Motivation 
    
   The ForCES architecture defines a network element (NE) as a single 
   managed entity made up of a collection of FEs and CEs and is 
   indistinguishable from other network elements in the network. This 
   NE model definition leads to two types of links from the networkÆs 
   perspective: internal (or intra-NE) links and external (or inter-NE) 
   links. Intra-NE links are purely internal to the NE and are not 
   exposed to the external world; whereas, inter-NE (or external) links 
   are exposed to the external world and over which routing adjacencies 
   (such as OSPF, IS-IS, BGP etc.) can be formed. An NE can contain FEs 
   that have zero or more internal/external links ¡ e.g. in Fig. 1, FE3 
   has two internal links and no external links while FE1 and FE2 have 
   two internal links and one external link each. Note that this link 
   definition does not include the control link connecting the FE to 
   CE. 
 
   In a traditional IP network, packets are forwarded from one network 
   element to the next using destination based forwarding, where the 
   packetÆs destination IP address is matched against the IP prefix 
   forwarding table and the appropriate output port/link is chosen. 
   However, a packet entering a ForCES NE may travel multiple FEs 
   within the NE before it exits onto the output link. This requires 
   that the packet be correctly routed from the ingress FE to the 
   egress FE. This internal routing requires knowledge of the physical 
   FE inter-connection topology so that the CE can appropriately setup 
   internal forwarding tables at each FE to forward the packets. Note 
   that traditional routing protocols such as OSPF, IS-IS, BGP etc. do 
   not operate on internal links and hence cannot provide the required 
   routing information to the forwarding tables. We, therefore, use a 
   simple topology discovery protocol that only operates on internal 
   links and provides the necessary routing information to route the 
   packet from the ingress FE to the egress FE. Further, the protocol 
   should be able to route around internal link failures, if a path 
   exists. This makes the NE highly available and resilient.

3. Element Bindings and Topology Discovery Protocol 
 
   Since the ForCES working group is currently focusing on the case 
   where the control and forwarding plane elements are single-hop away 
   (close proximity), we restrict the description to this focus area.   
   The protocol can be extended to multi-hop case as well, but is 
   currently  beyond  the  scope  of  this  document.  The  protocol  is 
   expected to work on point-to-point as well as multi-access links. 
   The discovery protocol should have the option of discovering either 
   the IP layer topology or data-link layer topology. The need for the 
   latter arises when an NE contains FEs with non-IP interfaces/links 
   connecting each other (e.g. using Ethernet directly). Choosing which 
   topology  discovery  mechanism  to  employ  is  done  through  either 
   configuration  or  negotiation  during  protocol  initialization.  We 
   shall  focus  on  the  ôIPö  topology  discovery  mechanism  in  this 
   document and leave the data-link topology discovery issue as future 
   study item. 
 
3.1. Minimum requirements

   In order for the protocol to work as described, the following 
   assumptions as made. 
     . Each element has been configured with their respective IDs 
        (CEID, FEID) 
     . Each element has been configured with IP addresses ¡ for ôIPö 
        topology discovery. 
     . The protocol is enabled on the required interfaces. 
    
   Note that these are configuration requirements and are satisfied by 
   the respective managers (CEM/FEM). 
      
3.2. Protocol Details 
    
   Each  ForCES  Protocol  Element  (PE  can  be  either  CE  or  FE) 
   periodically advertises Hello messages to all its neighbors on 
   configured interfaces. All protocol messages travel a single PE hop 
   and are not routed to other elements. The messages are sent as IP 
   datagrams (multicast/broadcast, where applicable, or unicast) to the 
   neighboring elements over IP configured interfaces. For non-IP/data-
   layer discovery, Subnetwork Access Network [SNAP] frames may be used 
   to ensure data-link layer independency and inter-operability. Each 
   FE  maintains  the  neighbor  relationships  as  long  as  the  Hello 
   messages are received from the neighbor. If it does not receive a 
   pre-determined number of back-to-back Hello messages from a given 
   neighbor, it deletes the neighbor relationship from its database and 
   reports this information to its CE. This ensures that the CE has the 
   complete and up-to-date information of the underlying topology of 
   the FE network. 
    
   The Hello message contains information useful for discovering and 
   maintaining neighbor relationships. It contains the PE ID, type of 
   protocol element (i.e. CE or FE), interval between any two messages, 
   interval for deeming a neighbor inactive, capability information 
   etc. This is, in some ways, similar to the capabilities of the OSPF 
   Hello  protocol,  but  with  additional  functionalities  such  as 
   determining element bindings and helping in inter-FE discovery. 
    
   The state machine for the discovery protocol is shown in Figure 2.

3.2.1. Element Bindings Discovery 
    
   Dynamic  element  discovery  occurs  as  a  result  of  checking  the 
   contents  of  the  received  Hello  messages  from  the  neighboring 
   elements. As part of the initial FE and CE configuration done by 
   their respective managers (FEM and CEM), each element has the list 
   of  associations  from  which  it  is  willing  to  communicate  and 
   establish connections. An FE is only required to accept requests 
   from those CEs that are in the pre-configured list. Similarly, the 
   CE  is  only  allowed  to  control  those  FEs,  and  hence  accept 
   connections from those FEs, that are on its pre-configured list. 
    
   On receiving the Hello message, the PE determines whether the 
   advertising neighbor is a CE or an FE by checking a flag within the 
   packet or the split address space PEID (as explained in [ForCESP]). 
   Once it determines the PE type, it matches the received ID with the 
   set of allowed IDs from its pre-configured set. Upon a successful 
   match, it notes the interface for communication with the remote PE. 
   Note that an FE only matches with the list of CEs and, a CE only 
   matches with a list of FEs. Hello messages received on a FE from a

Internet Draft             ForCES Discovery                  July 2004 
   neighboring FE will not match with the list of CEs on that FE, and 
   hence no bindings occur. The result of the bindings is to discover 
   the appropriate interface to use to communication with the CE (or 
   vice-versa) and the capabilities offered by the PE. Note that the 
   Hello messages continue to be exchanged on the CE-FE interface even 
   during post-association due to the possibility that a new CE or a FE 
   may come up over that interface and we, hence, need a mechanism to 
   auto-discover this. 
    
    
3.2.2. Topology Discovery and Maintenance 
    
   Since the CE needs to maintain consistent and up-to-date view of the 
   inter-FE topology, it needs to obtain real-time information of the 
   status of the internal links connecting the FEs. Since the topology 
   discovery and maintenance occurs during the post-association phase, 
   we make use of the event-notification and query/response messages 
   [ForCESP] of the ForCES protocol to provide this information to the 
   CE. It is important to note that each FE only maintains partial 
   topology   information   obtained   through   neighbor   relationship 
   maintenance through Hello messages. The partial topology view seen 
   by each FE is only the neighbor connectivity information. The CE has 
   to derive the complete topology view of the interconnected FEs based 
   on the partial topology information reported by each FE (or queried 
   by the CE). This ensures that that only the CE maintains all the 
   intelligence and the protocol operation on the FEs is very simple 
   and has minimal overhead. 
 
    
   The periodic Hello messages maintain PE neighbor relationships. 
   Any change in the link or neighbor status causes the FE to generate 
   an  asynchronous/event-driven  message  to  the  CE  indicating  this 
   change. The mechanism defined in [ForCESP] is used for delivering 
   event-driven messages from the FE to the CE. This involves the CE 
   subscribing to such event-driven messages from the FE.   
    
    
   The CE aggregates the partial topology information received from 
   each FE and generates the inter-FE topology. With this complete 
   knowledge of the inter-FE topology, it can now make appropriate 
   updates to the forwarding tables on each FE to route IP packets 
   inside the NE ¡ from ingress FE to egress FE, assuming that the 
   destination of the packet is not the current NE itself. Any changes 
   in the internal link states (and hence the topology) requires that 
   the CE reconfigure the forwarding tables on the FEs based on the 
   most up-to-date information to ensure that the packets do not end up 
   in a black hole.

3.4. Inter-FE Topology Discovery Examples 
    
   The following examples illustrate the topology discovery mechanism. 
   For sake of simplicity, we assume that there is only one CE per NE. 
   The FEIDs of the FEs in the topologies below are FE1, FE2, FE3, and 
   FE4. Each FE has port IDs labeled alphabetically. This is also the 
   case with the CE.

   During the element-binding phase, each FE sends out hello messages 
   with its FEID and Port ID (as outlined earlier) to all of its 
   neighbors. Since each neighboring FE also listens to such messages, 
   it  receives  the  hello  message  and  adds  it  to  the  neighbor 
   association table, which may look like that shown in Fig. (a). In 
   the topology discovery phase, which is post ForCES association 
   stage, the CE queries each FE about its neighbor table. The FE 
   responds  back  with  the  partial  topology  information  available 
   through its neighbor relationships. Both the query and the response 
   are carried by the ForCES protocol. The CE collects the partial 
   topology information from all the FEs in the NE and aggregates this 
   information to fully construct the inter-FE topology. Any changes to 
   the FE neighbor table, e.g. when a link state changes, generates a 
   trigger/update message to the CE. The new information is used to 
   recalculate  the  new  topology  and  subsequently  the  CE  takes 
   appropriate actions based on the new topology ¡ such as updating the 
   packet forwarding tables on the FEs. 
 
    
   The following examples show the neighbor association tables.
