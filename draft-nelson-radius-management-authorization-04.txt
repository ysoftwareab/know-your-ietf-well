Abstract

   This document describes Remote Aauthentication Dial-In User Service
   (RADIUS) attributes for the authorization and service provisioning of
   local and remote management of embedded systems and other managed
   entities, generally referred to as Network Access Servers (NASes).
   Specific provisions are made for remote management via framed
   management protocols, and for more granular levels of access rights
   and management privileges.

Internet-Draft     RADIUS NAS-Management Authorization     February 2007


1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document uses terminology from RFC 2865 [RFC2865] and RFC 2866
   [RFC2866].


2.  Introduction and Rationale

   The remote management Service-Types defined in RFC 2865 [RFC2865]
   include NAS-Prompt and Admin.  Both of these services provide access
   to the interactive, ASCII-text, Command Line Interface (CLI) of the
   managed entity.  Current deployments of network equipment include in
   the managed entity non-CLI, framed-protocol forms of management, such
   as HTTP, HTTPS, and SNMP.  In addition, network devices often support
   more privilege levels for management access than the two levels
   supported by NAS-Prompt (non-privileged) and Admin (privileged).  To
   address these issues, attributes for framed management protocols,
   management protocol security levels, and management access privilege
   levels are described.


3.  Provisions for Framed Management

   Framed Management means management of an entity by means of a non-
   interactive, non-CLI-style method.  The management information is
   typically formatted in a binary or textual protocol, such as HTTP or
   SNMP.  While remote management by interactive CLI sessions are
   carried over protocols, such as Telnet, Rlogin, and SSH, these
   protocols are primarily for the delivery of terminal, or pseudo-TTY
   services.  Command Line Interface, Menu Interface, or other ASCII
   (UTF-8) terminal emulation interfaces are not considered to be Framed
   Management protocols, as used in this document.  Examples of Framed
   Management protocols include HTTP, HTTPS, and SNMP.

   To support the authorization and provisioning of Framed Management
   access to managed entities, this document introduces a new value for
   the Service-Type attribute [RFC2865], and one new attribute.  The new
   value for the Service-Type attribute is Framed-Management.  The
   definition of this service is the provisioning of remote device
   management via a Framed Management protocol, as described in this
   section.  The new attribute is Framed-Management-Protocol, the value
   of which specifies a particular protocol for use in the remote
   management session.

Internet-Draft     RADIUS NAS-Management Authorization     February 2007


4.  Provisions for Granular Management Access Rights

   One new attribute is introduced in this document in support of
   granular management access rights or command privilege levels.  The
   Management-Policy-Id attribute is used to contain the name of a
   management access rights policy of local scope.  This attribute
   functions similarly to Filter-ID.  It is a string variable containing
   policy name of local scope.  The provisioning of the rules invoked by
   application of this management policy is by means outside the scope
   of this document, such as by MIB objects.

   The local application of the Management-Policy-Id within the managed
   entity may take the form of (a) one of an enumeration of command
   privilege levels, (b) a mapping into an SNMP View Based Access
   Control Method (VACM) table [RFC3415], or (c) some other set of
   management access policy rules that is mutually understood by the
   managed entity and the remote management application.  Examples are
   given in Section 8.


5.  Provisions for Secure CLI Management Access

   To provide for the authorization and provisioning of secure Command
   Line Access management methods, one new attribute is introduced in
   this document, Non-Framed-Management-Security.  The value of this
   attributes is an enumeration of security methods that may be required
   for the provisioning of NAS-Prompt or Admin service.


6.  New Values for Existing RADIUS Attributes

6.1.  Service-Type

   This document defines one new value for an existing RADIUS attribute.
   The Service-Type attribute is defined in Section 5.6 of RFC 2865
   [RFC2865], as follows:

   This Attribute indicates the type of service the user has requested,
   or the type of service to be provided.  It MAY be used in both
   Access-Request and Access-Accept packets.

   A NAS is not required to implement all of these service types, and
   MUST treat unknown or unsupported Service-Types as though an Access-
   Reject had been received instead.

   A summary of the Service-Type Attribute format is shown below.

   The fields are transmitted from left to right.

      This document defines one new value for the Service-Type
      attribute.

      (TBA)     Framed-Management

      The semantics of the Framed-Management service are as follows:

      Framed-Management   A framed protocol session should be started
                          for a remote management user or application,
                          such as HTTP or SNMP.


7.  New RADIUS Attributes

   This document defines six new RADIUS attributes related to remote
   management authorization.

7.1.  Framed-Management-Protocol

   The Framed-Management-Protocol attribute indicates the protocol to be
   used for framed management access.  It MAY be used in both Access-
   Request and Access-Accept packets.

   A summary of the Framed-Management-Protocol Attribute format is shown
   below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      Type

         (TBA) for Framed-Management-Protocol.

      Length

         6


      Value

         The Value field is four octets.

         1      SNMP v3
         2      HTTP
         3      HTTPS/TLS
         4      SFTP (via SSH)
         5      SCP (via SSH)

7.2.  Non-Framed-Management-Security

   The Non-Framed-Management-Security attribute indicates the mandated
   security parameters of non-framed management access sessions.  It MAY
   be used in both Access-Request and Access-Accept packets.  This
   attribute is used in conjunction with, and further specifies the
   standard RADIUS Service-Type attributes of NAS-Prompt and Admin.

   When a secure form of Non-Framed management access is specified, for
   example Telnet carried within Secure Shell (SSH), for access to the
   interactive CLI prompt of the NAS, it generally means that the
   terminal emulation session is encapsulated in some form of protected
   application transport, or tunnel.  It may also mean that an explicit
   secure mode of operation is required, when the terminal emulation
   access protocol contains an intrinsic secure mode of operation.

   A summary of the Non-Framed-Management-Security Attribute format is
   shown below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

         The Value field is four octets.

         1      None
         2      Secure remote console using Secure Shell (SSH)

7.3.  Management-Policy-Id

   The Management-Policy-Id attribute indicates the name of the
   management access policy for this user.  Zero or more Management-
   Policy-Id attributes MAY be sent in an Access-Accept packet.
   Identifying a policy by name allows the policy to be used on
   different NASes without regard to implementation details.

   Multiple forms of management access rules may be expressed by the
   underlying named policy, the definition of which is beyond the scope
   of this document.  The management access policy MAY be applied
   contextually, based on the nature of the management access method.
   For example, some named policies may only be valid for application to
   NAS-Prompt services and some other policies may only be valid for
   application to SMNPv3 services.

   The management access policy named in this attribute, received in an
   Access-Accept packet, MUST be applied to the session authorized by
   the Access-Accept.  If the policy name is unknown, or the policy
   rules are incorrectly formatted, the NAS SHOULD treat the packet as
   if it had been an Access-Reject.

   A summary of the Management-Policy-Id Attribute format is shown
   below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

   The Text field is one or more octets, and its contents are
   implementation dependent.  It is intended to be human readable and
   MUST NOT affect operation of the protocol.  It is recommended that
   the message contain UTF-8 encoded 10646 [RFC2279] characters.


8.  Examples of attribute groupings

   1.  CLI access, via local console or telnet, to the "super-user"
       access level:

       *  Service-Type (6) = Admin (6)
       *  Non-Framed-Management-Security (xx) = None (1)

   2.  CLI access, via SSH/telnet, to the non-privileged user access
       level:

       *  Service-Type (6) = NAS-Prompt (7)
       *  Non-Framed-Management-Security (xx) = SSH (2)

   3.  CLI access, via SSH/telnet, to a custom management access level,
       defined by a policy:

       *  Service-Type (6) = NAS-Prompt (7)
       *  Non-Framed-Management-Security (xx) = SSH (2)
       *  Management-Policy-Id (xx) = "Network Administrator"

   4.  SNMPv3 access, using a custom VACM View, defined by a policy:

       *  Service-Type (6) = Framed-Management (xx)

       *  Framed-Management-Protocol (xx) = SNMPv3 (3)
       *  Management-Policy-Id (xx) = "SNMP Network Administrator View"

   5.  Web (HTTP) access:

       *  Service-Type (6) = Framed-Management (xx)
       *  Framed-Management-Protocol (xx) = HTTP (4)

   6.  Secure web access, using a custom management access level,
       defined by a policy:

       *  Service-Type (6) = Framed-Management (xx)
       *  Framed-Management-Protocol (xx) = HTTPS/TLS (5)
       *  Management-Policy-Id (xx) = "Read-only web access"


9.  Diameter Translation Considerations

   When used in Diameter, the attributes defined in this specification
   can be used as Diameter AVPs from the Code space 1-255 (RADIUS
   attribute compatibility space).  No additional Diameter Code values
   are therefore allocated.  The data types and flag rules for the
   attributes are as follows:


                                    +---------------------+
                                    |    AVP Flag rules   |
                                    |----+-----+----+-----|----+
                                    |    |     |SHLD| MUST|    |
   Attribute Name        Value Type |MUST| MAY | NOT|  NOT|Encr|
   ---------------------------------|----+-----+----+-----|----|
   Service-Type (new value)         |    |     |    |     |    |
                         Enumerated | M  |  P  |    |  V  | Y  |
   Framed-Management-Protocol       |    |     |    |     |    |
                         Enumerated | M  |  P  |    |  V  | Y  |
   Non-Framed-Management-Security   |    |     |    |     |    |
                         Enumerated | M  |  P  |    |  V  | Y  |
   Management-Policy-Id             |    |     |    |     |    |
                         UTF8String | M  |  P  |    |  V  | Y  |
   ---------------------------------|----+-----+----+-----|----|


   The attributes in this specification have no special translation
   requirements for Diameter to RADIUS or RADIUS to Diameter gateways;
   they are copied as is, except for changes relating to headers,
   alignment, and padding.  See also [RFC3588] Section 4.1 and [RFC4005]
   Section 9.

Internet-Draft     RADIUS NAS-Management Authorization     February 2007


   What this specification says about the applicability of the
   attributes for RADIUS Access-Request packets applies in Diameter to
   AA-Request [RFC4005] or Diameter-EAP-Request [RFC4072].  What is said
   about Access-Challenge applies in Diameter to AA-Answer [RFC4005] or
   Diameter-EAP-Answer [RFC4072] with Result-Code AVP set to
   DIAMETER_MULTI_ROUND_AUTH.

   What is said about Access-Accept applies in Diameter to AA-Answer or
   Diameter-EAP-Answer messages that indicate success.  Similarly, what
   is said about RADIUS Access-Reject packets applies in Diameter to AA-
   Answer or Diameter-EAP-Answer messages that indicate failure.

   What is said about COA-Request applies in Diameter to Re-Auth-Request
   [RFC4005].


10.  Proxy Operation Considerations

   The device management access authorization attributes presented in
   this document present certain considerations when used in proxy
   environments.  These considerations are not different from those that
   exist in RFC 2865 [RFC2865] with respect to the Service-Type
   attribute values of Admin and NAS-Prompt.

   Most proxy environments are also multi-party environments.  In multi-
   party proxy environments it is important to distinguish which
   entities have the authority to provision management access to the
   edge devices, i.e.  NASes, and which entities only have authority to
   provision network access services of various sorts.

   It may be important that operators of the NAS are able to ensure that
   access to the CLI, or other management interfaces, of the NAS are
   only provisioned to their own employees or contractors.  One way for
   the NAS to enforce this requirement is to use only local, non-proxy
   RADIUS servers for management access requests.  Proxy RADIUS servers
   could be used for non-management access requests, based on local
   policy.  This "bifurcation" of RADIUS authentication and
   authorization is a simple case of separate administrative realms.
   The NAS may be designed so as to maintain separate lists of RADIUS
   servers for management AAA use and for non-management AAA use.

   An alternate method of enforcing this requirement would be for the
   first-hop proxy server, operated by the owner of the NAS, to filter
   out any RADIUS attributes that provision management access rights
   that originate from "up-stream" proxy servers not operated by the NAS
   owner.  Access-Accept messages that provision such locally un-
   authorized management access MAY be treated as if they were an
   Access-Reject by the first-hop proxy server.

Internet-Draft     RADIUS NAS-Management Authorization     February 2007


   These issues are not of concern when all the RADIUS servers, local
   and proxy, used by the NAS are under the sole administrative control
   of the NAS owner.


11.  Table of Attributes

   The following table provides a guide to which attributes may be found
   in which kinds of packets, and in what quantity.

   Access-
   Request Accept Reject Challenge  #    Attribute
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   0-1     0-1      0        0     TBA   Framed-Management-Protocol
   0-1     0-1      0        0     TBA   Non-Framed-Management-Security
   0       0+       0        0     TBA   Management-Policy-Id

   Accounting-
   Request Response  #    Attribute
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   0-1     0        TBA   Framed-Management-Protocol
   0-1     0        TBA   Non-Framed-Management-Security
   0+      0        TBA   Management-Policy-Id

   The following table defines the meaning of the above table entries.

   0    This attribute MUST NOT be present in a packet.
   0+   Zero or more instances of this attribute MAY be present in
        a packet.
   0-1  Zero or one instance of this attribute MAY be present in
        a packet.
   1    Exactly one instance of this attribute MUST be present in
        a packet.


12.  IANA Considerations

   This document contains placeholders ("TBA") for assigned numbers
   within the RADIUS Attributes registry, to be assigned by IANA at the
   time this document should be published as an RFC.


13.  Security Considerations

   This specification describes the use of RADIUS and Diameter for
   purposes of authentication, authorization and accounting for
   management access to devices within local area networks.  RADIUS
   threats and security issues for this application are described in

Internet-Draft     RADIUS NAS-Management Authorization     February 2007


   [RFC3579] and [RFC3580]; security issues encountered in roaming are
   described in [RFC2607].  For Diameter, the security issues relating
   to this application are described in [RFC4005] and [RFC4072].

   This document specifies new attributes that can be included in
   existing RADIUS packets, which may be protected as described in
   [RFC3579] and [RFC3576].  In Diameter, the attributes are protected
   as specified in [RFC3588].  See those documents for a more detailed
   description.

   The security mechanisms supported in RADIUS and Diameter are focused
   on preventing an attacker from spoofing packets or modifying packets
   in transit.  They do not prevent an authorized RADIUS/Diameter server
   or proxy from inserting attributes with malicious intent.

   Any of the attributes described in this memo, with the exception of
   Service-Type, may not be understood by the NAS which receives it.  A
   legacy NAS not compliant with this specification may silently discard
   these attributes while permitting the user to access the management
   interface(s) of the NAS.  This can lead to users improperly receiving
   unauthorized management access to the NAS, or access with greater
   levels of access rights than were intended.  RADIUS servers SHOULD
   attempt to ascertain whether or not the NAS supports these attributes
   before sending them in an Access-Accept.
