    <abstract>
      <t>Applications differ with respect to whether they need session 
	  continuity and/or IP address reachability. The network providing the 
	  same type of service to any mobile host and any application running on 
	  the host yields inefficiencies, as described in RFC 7333. 
	  
	  This document defines a new concept of enabling applications to influence the 
	  network's mobility services (session continuity and/or IP address reachability) 
	  on a per-socket basis, and suggests extensions to the networking stack's API
	  to accommodate this concept.

      <t>In the context of Mobile IP <xref target="RFC5563" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC6275" format="default"/> 
<xref target="RFC5213" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC5944" format="default"/>, 
			the following two attributes are defined for IP service provided to  
			mobile hosts:</t>
      <dl newline="true">
         <dt>Session Continuity</dt>
            <dd>The ability to maintain an ongoing transport interaction 
			by keeping the same local endpoint IP address throughout the lifetime of the IP 
			socket despite the mobile host changing its point of attachment within the IP 
			network topology. The IP address of the host may change after closing the IP socket 
			and before opening a new one, but that does not jeopardize the ability of applications 
			using these IP sockets to work flawlessly. Session continuity is essential for mobile 
			hosts to maintain ongoing flows without any interruption.</dd>
         <dt>IP Address Reachability</dt>
           <dd>The ability to maintain the same IP address 
			for an extended period of time. The IP address stays the same across 
			independent sessions, even in the absence of any session. The 
			IP address may be published in a long-term registry (e.g., DNS) and 
			is made available for serving incoming (e.g., TCP) connections. IP 
			address reachability is essential for mobile hosts to use 
			specific/published IP addresses.</dd>
      </dl>

      <t>Mobile IP is designed to provide both session continuity and IP 
			address reachability to mobile hosts. Architectures using these 
			protocols (e.g., 3GPP, 3GPP2, WiMAX) ensure that any mobile host 
			attached to a compliant network can enjoy these benefits. Any 
			application running on these mobile hosts is subjected to the same 
			treatment with respect to session continuity and IP address 
			reachability.</t>
      <t>Achieving session continuity and IP address reachability with 
			Mobile IP incurs some cost. Mobile IP forces the mobile host's 
			IP traffic to traverse a centrally located router (Home Agent,  HA), 
			which incurs additional transmission latency and use of additional 
			network resources, adds to the network's operating and capital expenditures, and decreases the 
			reliability of the network due to the introduction of a single point of 
			failure <xref target="RFC7333" format="default"/>. Therefore, session continuity 
			and IP address reachability <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be provided only when necessary.</t>
      <t>In reality, not every application may need 
			these benefits. IP address reachability is required for applications 
			running as servers (e.g., a web server running on the mobile host), but
			a typical client application (e.g., web browser) does not necessarily 
			require IP address reachability. Similarly, session continuity is not 
			required for all types of applications either. Applications performing 
			brief communication (e.g., text messaging) can survive without having session 
			continuity support.</t>

      <t>Furthermore, when an application needs session continuity, it may be 
			able to satisfy that need by using a solution above the IP layer, such 
			as Multipath TCP <xref target="RFC6824" format="default"/>, SIP mobility <xref target="RFC3261" format="default"/>, or an application-layer mobility solution. These 
			higher-layer solutions are not subject to the same issues that arise 
			with the use of Mobile IP since they can use the most direct data 
			path between the endpoints. But, if Mobile IP is being applied to the 
			mobile host, the higher-layer protocols are rendered useless because 
			their operation is inhibited by Mobile IP. Since Mobile IP ensures 
			that the IP address of the mobile host remains fixed (despite the location 
			and movement of the mobile host), the higher-layer protocols never 
			detect the IP-layer change and never engage in mobility management.</t>
      <t>This document proposes a solution for applications running on 
			mobile hosts to indicate when establishing the network connection ('on 
			demand') whether they need session continuity or IP 
			address reachability. The network protocol stack on the mobile host, in 
			conjunction with the network infrastructure, provides the required 
			type of service. It is for the benefit of both the users and the 
			network operators not to engage an extra level of service unless it is 
			absolutely necessary. It is expected that applications and networks 
			compliant with this specification will utilize this solution to use 
			network resources more efficiently.</t>

        <name>High-Level Description</name>
        <t> Enabling applications to indicate their mobility service requirements 
		(e.g., session continuity and/or IP address reachability) comprises the 
		following steps:</t>
<ol>
        <li>The application indicates to the network stack (local to the 
		mobile host) the desired mobility service.</li>
        <li>The network stack assigns a source IP address based on an IP prefix 
		with the desired services that was previously provided by the network. 
		If such an IP prefix is not available, the network stack performs the 
		additional steps below.</li>
        <li>The network stack sends a request to the network for a new source 
		IP prefix that is associated with the desired mobility service.</li>
        <li>The network responds with the suitable allocated source IP prefix 
		(or responds with a failure indication).</li>
        <li>If the suitable source IP prefix was allocated, the network stack 
		constructs a source IP address and provides it to the application.</li>
</ol>
        <t> This document specifies the new address types associated with 
		mobility services and details the interaction between the applications 
		and the network stack steps. It uses the socket interface as an example 
		for an API between applications and the network stack. Other steps are 
		outside the scope of this document.</t>

      <section anchor="addresstypes" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Types of IP Addresses</name>
        <t> Four types of IP addresses are defined with respect to mobility 
		management:</t>
      <dl newline="true">
        <dt>Fixed IP address</dt>
        <dd>
        <t> A Fixed IP address is an address guaranteed to be valid for a 
		very long time, regardless of whether it is being used in any packet 
		to/from the mobile host, or whether or not the mobile host is 
		connected to the network, or whether it moves from one 
		point of attachment to another (with a different IP prefix) while it is 
		connected.</t>
        <t>Fixed IP addresses are required by applications that need both session 
		continuity and IP address reachability.</t>
        </dd>
        <dt>Session-Lasting IP address</dt>
        <dd>
        <t>A Session-Lasting IP address is an address guaranteed to be 
		valid for the lifetime of the socket(s) for which it was requested. 
		It is guaranteed to be valid even after the mobile host has moved from one 
		point of attachment to another (with a different IP prefix).</t>
        <t>Session-Lasting IP addresses are required by applications that need 
		session continuity but do not need IP address reachability.</t>
        </dd>
        <dt>Nonpersistent IP address</dt>
        <dd>
        <t>This type of IP address is not guaranteed to exist after a mobile host 
		moves from one point of attachment to another; therefore, no session 
		continuity nor IP address reachability are provided. The IP address is created 
		from an IP prefix that is obtained from the serving IP gateway and is not 
		maintained across gateway changes. In other words, the IP prefix may be released 
		and replaced by a new one when the IP gateway changes due to the movement of the 
		mobile host forcing the creation of a new source IP address with the updated 
		allocated IP prefix.</t>
        </dd>
        <dt>Graceful-Replacement IP address</dt>
        <dd>
        <t>In some cases, the network cannot guarantee the validity of the provided 
		IP prefix throughout the duration of the opened socket, but can provide a limited 
		graceful period of time in which both the original IP prefix and a new one are 
		valid. This enables the application some flexibility in the transition from the 
		existing source IP address to the new one.</t>
        <t>This gracefulness is still better than the nonpersistence type of address 
		for applications that can handle a change in their source IP address but require 
		that extra flexibility.</t>
        </dd>
      </dl>
        <t>Applications running as servers at a published IP address require a 
		Fixed IP address.  Long-standing applications (e.g., an SSH session) 
		may also require this type of address. Enterprise applications that 
		connect to an enterprise network via virtual LAN require a Fixed IP 
	        address.</t>
        <t>Applications with short-lived transient sessions (e.g., web browsers) can use 
		Session-Lasting IP addresses.</t>
        <t>Applications with very short sessions, such as DNS clients and 
		instant messengers, can use Nonpersistent IP addresses. Even 
		though they could very well use Fixed or Session-Lasting IP 
		addresses, the transmission latency would be minimized when a 
		Nonpersistent IP address is used.</t>
        <t>Applications that can tolerate a short interruption in connectivity 
		can use the Graceful-Replacement IP addresses, for example, a streaming 
		client that has buffering capabilities.</t>

      <!-- Types of IP Addresses -->
      <section anchor="granularity" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Granularity of Selection</name>
        <t>IP address type selection is made on a per-socket granularity. 
		Different parts of the same application may have different needs. For 
		example, the control plane of an application may require a Fixed IP 
		address in order to stay reachable, whereas the data plane of the same 
		application may be satisfied with a Session-Lasting IP address.</t>
      </section>
      <!-- Granularity of Selection -->
      <section anchor="ondemand" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>On-Demand Nature</name>
        <t>At any point in time, a mobile host may have a combination of IP 
		addresses configured. Zero or more Fixed, zero or more Session-Lasting, 
		zero or more Nonpersistent, and zero or more Graceful-Replacement 
		IP addresses may be configured by the IP stack of the host. The 
		combination may be a result of the host policy, application demand, 
		or a mix of the two.</t>
        <t>When an application requires a specific type of IP address, and such 
		an address is not already configured on the host, the IP stack <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> 
		attempt to configure one. For example, a host may not always have a 
		Session-Lasting IP address available. When an application requests 
		one, the IP stack <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> make an attempt to configure one by issuing a 
		request to the network. If the operation fails, the IP stack <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> 
		fail the associated socket request and return an error. If successful, 
		a Session-Lasting IP address is configured on the mobile host. If 
		another socket requests a Session-Lasting IP address at a later time,
		the same IP address may be served to that socket as well.  When the last 
		socket using the same configured IP address is closed, the IP address 
		may be released, or it may be kept for applications requiring a Session-Lasting 
		IP address that may be launched in the future.</t>
        <t>In some cases, it might be preferable for the mobile host to request 
		a new Session-Lasting IP address for a new opening of an IP socket 
		(even though one was already assigned to the mobile host by the 
		network and might be in use in a different, already active IP 
		socket).  It is outside the scope of this specification to define 
		criteria for choosing to use available addresses or choosing to request 
		new ones. It supports both alternatives (and any combination).</t>
        <t>It is outside the scope of this specification to define how the 
		host requests a specific type of prefix and how the network indicates 
		the type of prefix in its advertisement or in its reply to a request.</t>
        <t>The following are matters of policy, which may be dictated by the 
		host itself, the network operator, or the system architecture 
		standard:</t>
<ul>
        <li>The initial set of IP addresses configured on the host at boot 
		time</li>
        <li>Permission to grant various types of IP addresses to a requesting 
		application</li>

        <li>Determination of a default address type when an application does 
      not explicitly indicate whether it supports the required API or is a

        <t><xref target="RFC5014" format="default"/> defines new flags that may be used with

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t> The different service types (session continuity types and address reachability) associated
	with the allocated IP address types may be associated with different costs: the cost 
	to the operator for enabling a type of service, and the cost to applications using a 
	selected service. A malicious application may use these to indirectly
	generate extra billing of a mobile subscriber, and/or impose costly
	services on the mobile operator. When expensive 
	services are limited, malicious applications may exhaust them, preventing other 
	applications on the same mobile host from being able to use them.</t>
      <t> Mobile hosts that enable such service options should provide capabilities for 
	ensuring that only authorized applications can use the expensive (or limited) service 
	types.</t>
      <t> The ability to select service types requires the exchange of the association of 
	source IP prefixes and their corresponding service types, between the mobile host and
	mobile network. Exposing these associations may provide information to passive 
	attackers even if the traffic that is used with these addresses is encrypted.</t>
      <t>To avoid profiling an application according to the type of IP address,
	it is expected that prefixes provided by the mobile operator are associated with 
	various types of addresses over time. As a result, the type of address
	cannot be associated with the prefix, making application profiling based on the
	type of address more difficult. </t>
      <t>The application or the OS should ensure that IP addresses regularly change 
	to limit IP tracking by a passive observer.  The application should regularly 
	set the On-Demand flag. The application should be able to ensure that Session-Lasting 
        IP addresses are regularly changed by setting a lifetime, for example, 
	handled by the application. In addition, the application should consider the use
	of Graceful-Replacement IP addresses. </t>
      <t> Similarly, the OS may also associate IP addresses with a lifetime. Upon
	receiving a request for a given type of IP address, after some time, the
	OS should request a new address to the network even if it already has one IP 
	address available with the requested type. This includes any type of IP address. 
	IP addresses of type Graceful-Replacement or nonpersistent should be 
	regularly renewed by the OS.</t>
      <t> The lifetime of an IP address may be expressed in number of seconds or
	in number of bytes sent through this IP address. </t>

      <name>Conveying the Desired Address Type</name>
      <t>The following are some suggestions of possible extensions to the socket API 
		for enabling applications to convey their session continuity and address 
		reachability requirements.</t>
      <t><xref target="RFC5014" format="default"/> introduced the ability of applications 
		to influence the source address selection with the IPV6_ADDR_PREFERENCE 
		option at the IPPROTO_IPV6 level. This option is used with setsockopt() 
		and getsockopt() calls to set/get address selection preferences.</t>
      <t>One alternative is to extend the definition of the IPV6_ADDR_REFERENCE 
		option with flags that express the invoker's desire. An "OnDemand" field could 
		contain one of the following values: FIXED_IP_ADDRESS, SESSION_LASTING_IP_ADDRESS,
		NON_PERSISTENT_IP_ADDRESS, or GRACEFUL_REPLACEMENT_IP_ADDRESS.</t>
      <t>Another alternative is to define a new socket function used by the invoker
		to convey its desire. This enables the implementation of two behaviors of
		socket functions: the existing setsockopt() is a function that returns after 
		executing, and the new setsc() (Set Service Continuity) is a function that may
		initiate a request for the desired service, and wait until the network responds 
		with the allocated resources, before returning to the invoker.</t>
      <t>After obtaining an IP address with the desired behavior, the application can 
		call the bind() socket function to associate that received IP address with the 
		socket.</t>
