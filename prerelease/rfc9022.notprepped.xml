                This document specifies the format, contents, and semantics of 
                Domain Name Registration Data (DNRD) escrow deposits for a 
                domain name registry.

      <t>
                Registry Data Escrow (RDE) is the process by which a registry periodically submits data 
                deposits to a third party called an escrow agent. These deposits comprise the 
                minimum data needed by a third party to resume operations if the registry 
                cannot function and is unable or unwilling to facilitate an  
                orderly transfer of service.  
                For example, for a domain name registry or registrar, the data to be deposited
                would include all the objects related to registered domain names, e.g.,
                names, contacts, name servers, etc.
      </t>
      <t>          
The goal of data escrow is higher resiliency of registration services for the benefit of Internet users.  The beneficiaries of a registry are not just those registering information there, but also the users of services relying on the registry data.
                    
      </t>
      <t>        
                In the context of domain name registries, registration data escrow is 
                a requirement for generic top-level domains (e.g., Specification 2 of the ICANN Base Registry Agreement, see <xref target="ICANN-GTLD-RA-20170731" format="default"/>) and some country code top-level 
                domain managers are also currently escrowing data. 
                There is also a similar requirement for ICANN-accredited 
                domain registrars.            
      </t>
      <t>              
                This document defines the standard set of objects for
                a domain name registry that uses the Registry Data Escrow Specification described in <xref target="RFC8909" format="default"/> for escrow.
                The set of objects include:

                This document defines two different models that can be used to
                deposit data escrow objects: XML and CSV (comma-separated values). 
      </t>
      <t>
            	The data escrow deposit <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> contain a mix of both models, but an object <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
                be escrowed only in one model.
      </t>
      <t>
            	This document does not suggest the use of a particular model, and both are equivalent.
                A domain name registry may choose the model that is more appropriate for the peculiarities of its systems.
                For example, a registry may use the CSV-export functionality of the Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) for escrow;
                therefore, the CSV model may be more appropriate.
                Another registry may use the code developed for EPP to implement escrow.
      </t>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>XML Model</name>
        <t> 
                        The XML model includes all the deposit information (metadata
                        and data) in an XML document.  The definition of the XML format is
                        fully defined in the XML schemas.  As a convention, the objects represented 
                        using the XML model are referenced using RDE and an XML namespace that is 
                        prefixed with "rde".  For example, the Domain Name object represented using 
                        the XML model can be referred to as the RDE Domain Name with the XML 
                        namespace including rdeDomain (urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:rdeDomain-1.0).

                        The CSV model uses XML to define the data escrow format of the
                        data contained in referenced CSV files.  As a 
                        convention, the objects represented using the CSV model is referenced 
                        using CSV and an XML namespace that is prefixed with "csv".  For example, 
                        the domain name object represented using the CSV model can be referred 
                        to as the CSV Domain Name with the XML namespace including csvDomain (urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:csvDomain-1.0).

              The CSV model represents a relational model where the CSV files represent relational tables, the fields of the CSV files represent columns of the tables, and each line of the CSV file 
              represents a record.  As in a relational model, the CSV files can have relationships utilizing primary keys in the parent CSV file definitions and 
              foreign keys in the child CSV file definitions for a one-to-many relationship.  The primary keys are not explicitly defined, but the foreign keys are using the 
              boolean "parent" field attribute in the child CSV file.  The relationships between the CSV files are used to support a cascade replace or cascade delete of records starting

            <t>
                To support the CSV model, an element is defined 
      for each object that substitutes for the &lt;rde:content&gt; element and for the &lt;rde:delete&gt; element, that contains one or more 
      &lt;rdeCsv:csv&gt; elements.  For example, the <xref target="domainNameObject" format="default">'Domain Name Object'</xref> defines the &lt;csvDomain:contents&gt; element, that substitutes for the &lt;rde:content&gt; element, 
      and the &lt;csvDomain:deletes&gt; element, that substitutes for the &lt;rde:delete&gt; element.  Both the &lt;csvDomain:contents&gt; element and the 
      &lt;csvDomain:deletes&gt; elements contain one or more &lt;rdeCsv:csv&gt; elements.
                  The &lt;rdeCsv:csv&gt; element has the following child elements:</t>
            <dl newline="false" spacing="normal">
              <dt>&lt;rdeCsv:fields&gt;</dt>
              <dd>Ordered list of CSV fields used in the CSV files.  There are one or more 
                    child elements that substitute for the &lt;rdeCsv:field&gt; abstract element.  Each element 
                    defines the format of the CSV field contained in the CSV files.  The &lt;rdeCsv:field&gt; elements  
                    support the "type" attribute that defines the XML simple data type of the field element.  The &lt;rdeCsv:field&gt; 
                    elements support the "isRequired" attribute, which has a default value of "false". When set to "true", this indicates that the field must be non-empty 
                    in the CSV files, and when set to "false", this indicates that the field <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be empty in the CSV files.  The "isRequired" 
                    attribute <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be specifically set for the field elements within the XML schema and <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be overridden when specifying 
                    the fields under the &lt;rdeCsv:fields&gt; element.  The &lt;rdeCsv:field&gt; element supports an <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14> "parent" attribute 
                    that identifies the field as a reference to a parent object, as defined in the <xref target="csvParentChildRelationship" format="default">'CSV Parent Child Relationship'</xref>.  
                    For example, the &lt;rdeCsv:csv name="domainStatuses"&gt; &lt;csvDomain:fName&gt; field <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> 
                    set the "parent" attribute to "true" to identify it as the parent domain name of the domain status.</dd>
              <dt>&lt;rdeCsv:files&gt;</dt>
              <dd><t>A list of one or more CSV files using the &lt;rdeCsv:file&gt; child element.  
                    The &lt;rdeCsv:file&gt; child element defines a reference to the CSV file name and has the following optional attributes:</t>
                <dl newline="false" spacing="normal">
                  <dt>compression</dt>
                  <dd>If the CSV file is compressed, the "compression" attribute defines the compression format. For example, setting this attribute to "gzip" signals that the CSV file is compressed using the GZIP file format (see <xref target="RFC1952" format="default"/>). The supported compression formats are negotiated out of band.
                      </dd>
                  <dt>encoding</dt>
                  <dd>Defines the encoding of the CSV file with the default encoding of "UTF-8".
                      </dd>
                  <dt>cksum</dt>
                  <dd>Defines the checksum of the CSV file, as described in <xref target="checksum" format="default"/>, using the algorithm defined by the "cksumAlg" attribute. If the "cksumAlg" attribute is not present, the checksum is calculated using "CRC32".
                      </dd>
                  <dt>cksumAlg</dt>
                  <dd>Defines the checksum algorithm used to calculate the "cksum" attribute, with the default value of "CRC32". If the value "SHA256" is specified, the SHA-256 algorithm (see <xref target="RFC6234" format="default"/>) <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be used to calculate the "cksum" attribute. Parties receiving and processing data escrow deposits <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> support CRC32 and SHA-256. If this attribute is present, the "cksum" attribute <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> also be present. Additional checksum algorithms are negotiated out of band.

              </dd>
            </dl>
            <t>The &lt;rdeCsv:csv&gt; element requires a "name" attribute that defines the 
                  purpose of the CSV file with values like "domain", "host", "contact".  The supported "name" attribute values 
                  are defined for each object type.  The <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14> "sep" attribute defines the CSV separator character with the default separator character of ",". The need for quoting or escaping of the CSV data could be avoided by choosing a separator character that is not in the data set of the CSV files.

                  An NNDN (NNDN's not domain name) can be used to store registry reserved names or (blocked, withheld, or mirrored) IDN variants.
        </t>
        <t>
                  Domain name registries may maintain domain names without their being persisted as domain objects in the registry system, for example, a list of reserved names not available for registration. The NNDN is a lightweight domain-like object that is used to escrow domain names not maintained as domain name objects.
        </t>
        <t>
               A domain name can only exist as a domain name object or an NNDN object, but not both. 
        </t>
        <t>
                    The NNDN object supports 
                    both the XML and the CSV model, defined in <xref target="models" format="default">'Models'</xref>.  
                    The elements used for both models are defined in the following sections.

                    abstract element to create a concrete definition of an NNDN.  The
                    &lt;rdeNNDN:abstractDomain&gt; element can be replaced by other NNDN definitions
                    using the XML schema substitution groups feature.

                            An &lt;aName&gt; element that contains the fully qualified name of the NNDN.
                            For IDNs, the A-label is used (see <xref target="RFC5891" section="4.4" sectionFormat="comma" format="default"/>).

                                <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be provided if available.

                                An <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14> &lt;idnTableId&gt; element that references the IDN table used for the NNDN.
                                This corresponds to the "id" attribute of the &lt;idnTableRef&gt; element. This
                                element <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be present if the NNDN is an IDN.

                                An <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14> &lt;originalName&gt; element is used to indicate that the NNDN is used for an IDN variant.
                                This element contains the domain name used to generate the IDN variant. 
                            </li>

                <t>
                                A &lt;nameState&gt; element that indicates the state of the NNDN: blocked, withheld, or mirrored.

                <ul spacing="normal">
                  <li>
                                        If an NNDN is considered undesirable for registration (i.e., unavailable for allocation to 
                                        anyone), then the NNDN will be tagged as "blocked".

                  <li>
                                    If an NNDN is considered a potential registration of a domain name object for a registrant, 
                                    then the NNDN will be tagged as "withheld". This status is only used when the NNDN is used for an
                                    IDN variant.
                                  </li>

                                    If an NNDN is considered a mirrored IDN variant of a domain name object, then the NNDN will be tagged as "mirrored". A "mirroringNS" attribute is used to specify if the mirrored IDN variant uses the NS mirror mechanism, meaning that the activated variant domain name (i.e., NNDN) is delegated in the DNS using the same NS records as in the &lt;originalName&gt;. The default value of "mirroringNS" is true. If another mechanism such as DNAME <xref target="RFC6672" format="default"/> is used, the value of the "mirroringNS" attribute <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be false.

For example in a data escrow deposit for the .EXAMPLE TLD, a value of "example" in the "rcdn" attribute within the &lt;count&gt; element indicates the number of objects in the TLD including objects in other RCDNs within the TLD, whereas a value of "com.example" indicates the number of elements for objects under "com.example" and lower levels. Omitting the "rcdn" attribute indicates that the total includes all objects of the specified "uri" in the repository (e.g., the TLD, Registrar, or PPSP).

              A registry could choose to escrow IDN variants as domains or NNDN objects. A specific IDN variant can be represented
              in the escrow deposit, as a domain or as an NNDN object, but not both.
      </t>
      <t>
            If using domain objects to represent IDN variants, the normal behavior 
            during restoration of an SRS based on an escrow deposit is to restore the 
            IDN variants as a mirrored variant. If the registration data of the IDN 
            variant is different from the original name, the details of this specific 
            implementation <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be described in the IDN policy document.
      </t>
      <t>
                An NNDN or a domain name are explicit representations of an IDN variant while an IDN variant that is 
                computed based on an algorithm is an implicit representation. Explicit representation of an IDN variant
                takes precedence over an implicit representation.

                Different business models of registries exist, therefore the registry is responsible for defining
                a profile that matches its particular business model. The profile mechanism allows a registry

      <t>
                Data escrow deposits are represented in XML, which provides native support for encoding information 
                using the Unicode character set and its more compact representations including UTF-8. Conformant XML 
                processors recognize both UTF-8 and UTF-16. Though XML includes provisions to identify and use other 
                character encodings through use of an "encoding" attribute in an &lt;?xml?&gt; declaration, the use of UTF-8 
                is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14>.

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>
                This specification does not define the security mechanisms to be used in the transmission of the data escrow 
                deposits, since it only specifies the minimum necessary to enable the rebuilding of a registry from 
                deposits without intervention from the original registry.
      </t>
      <t>
                Depending on local policies, some elements, or, most likely, the whole deposit will be considered confidential. As such, the parties <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> take all the necessary precautions such as encrypting the data at rest and in transit to avoid inadvertent disclosure of private data. Regardless of the precautions taken by the parties regarding data at rest and in transit, authentication credentials <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be escrowed.
      </t>
      <t>
                Authentication of the parties passing data escrow deposit files is also of the utmost importance. The escrow agent <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> properly authenticate the registry's identity before accepting data escrow deposits. The registry <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> authenticate the escrow agent's identity before submitting any data, and the data escrow agent <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> authenticate the identity of the party receiving the data escrow deposits for the purposes deemed appropriate.
      </t>
      <t>
                Additionally, the registry and the escrow agent <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use integrity checking mechanisms to ensure the data transmitted is what the source intended. Validation of the contents by the parties is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> to ensure that the file was transmitted correctly from the registry or escrow agent and that the contents are "meaningful".
      </t>
      <t>A few elements in this specification contain URLs; the use of HTTP over TLS (Transport Layer Security) <xref target="RFC2818" format="default"/> is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> on the URLs. </t>
      <t>The various data structures in the document include a few places that have internal redundancy, and if the values become inconsistent there can be harmful consequences, such as different entities using different fields as their reference.</t>
      <aside><t>Note: if TLS is used when providing an escrow service, the recommendations in <xref target="BCP195" format="default"/> <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be implemented.</t></aside>
    </section>
    <section numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Privacy Considerations</name>
      <t>
This specification defines a format that may be used to escrow personal data.  The process of data escrow is governed by a legal document that is agreed to by the parties, and such a legal document must ensure that privacy-sensitive and/or personal data receives the required protection.
