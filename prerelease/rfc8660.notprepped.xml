      <t>
   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source-routing paradigm.  A node
   steers a packet through a controlled set of instructions, called
   segments, by prepending the packet with an SR header.  In the MPLS
   data plane, the SR header is instantiated through a label stack. This
   document specifies the forwarding behavior to allow instantiating SR
   over the MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS).</t>

      <name>MPLS Instantiation of Segment Routing</name>
      <t>
   MPLS instantiation of Segment Routing fits in the MPLS architecture
   as defined in <xref target="RFC3031" format="default"/> from both a control-plane and forwarding-plane
   perspective:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>From a control-plane perspective, <xref target="RFC3031" format="default"/> does not mandate a
      single signaling protocol.  Segment Routing makes use of various
      control-plane protocols such as link-state IGPs <xref target="RFC8665" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC8666" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC8667" format="default"/>.
      The flooding mechanisms of link-state IGPs fit very well with
      label stacking on the ingress. A future control-layer protocol and/or
      policy/configuration can be used to specify the label stack.</li>
      <li>From a forwarding-plane perspective, Segment Routing does not
      require any change to the forwarding plane because Segment IDs
      (SIDs) are instantiated as MPLS labels, and the Segment Routing
      header is instantiated as a stack of MPLS labels.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>
   We call the "MPLS Control Plane Client (MCC)" any control-plane entity
   installing forwarding entries in the MPLS data plane. Local
   configuration and policies applied on a router are examples of MCCs.</t>
      <t>

   In order to have a node segment reach the node, a network operator
   <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> configure at least one node segment per routing instance,
   topology, or algorithm. Otherwise, the node is not reachable within
   the routing instance, within the topology, 
   or along the routing algorithm, which restricts 
   its ability to be used by an SR Policy and as a 
   Topology Independent Loop-Free Alternate (TI-LFA).</t>
      <section anchor="convert-section-2.1" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Multiple Forwarding Behaviors for the Same Prefix</name>
        <t>
   The SR architecture does not prohibit having more than one SID for
   the same prefix. In fact, by allowing multiple SIDs for the same
   prefix, it is possible to have different forwarding behaviors (such
   as different paths, different ECMP and Unequal-Cost Multipath (UCMP) behaviors, etc.) for the
   same destination.</t>
        <t>
   Instantiating Segment Routing over the MPLS forwarding plane fits
   seamlessly with this principle. An operator may assign multiple MPLS
   labels or indices to the same prefix and assign different forwarding
   behaviors to each label/SID. The MCC in the network downloads
   different MPLS labels/SIDs to the FIB for different forwarding
   behaviors. The MCC at the entry of an SR domain or at any point in
   the domain can choose to apply a particular forwarding behavior to a
   particular packet by applying the PUSH action to that packet using
   the corresponding SID.</t>

      <section anchor="convert-section-2.2" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>SID Representation in the MPLS Forwarding Plane</name>
        <t>
   When instantiating SR over the MPLS forwarding plane, a SID is
   represented by an MPLS label or an index <xref target="RFC8402" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>
   A global SID is a label, or an index that may be mapped to an
   MPLS label within the Segment Routing Global Block (SRGB), of the node
   that installs a global SID in its FIB and receives the labeled
   packet. <xref target="convert-section-2.4" format="default"/> specifies the procedure to map a global segment
   represented by an index to an MPLS label within the SRGB.</t>
        <t>
   The MCC <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> ensure that any label value corresponding to any SID it
   installs in the forwarding plane follows the rules below:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>The label value <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be unique within the router on which the MCC
      is running, i.e., the label <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> only be used to represent the SID
      and <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be used to represent more than one SID or for any
      other forwarding purpose on the router.</li>
          <li>The label value <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> come from the range of special-purpose
      labels <xref target="RFC7274" format="default"/>.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>
   Labels allocated in this document are considered per-platform downstream
   allocated labels <xref target="RFC3031" format="default"/>.</t>

      <section anchor="convert-section-2.3" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Segment Routing Global Block and Local Block</name>
        <t>
   The concepts of SRGB and global SID
   are explained in <xref target="RFC8402" format="default"/>. In general, the SRGB need not be a
   contiguous range of labels.</t>
       <t>
For the rest of this document, the SRGB is specified by the list of
MPLS label ranges [Ll(1),Lh(1)], [Ll(2),Lh(2)],..., [Ll(k),Lh(k)]
where  Ll(i) =&lt; Lh(i).
       </t>
        <t>
   The following rules apply to the list of MPLS ranges representing the
   SRGB:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>The list of ranges comprising the SRGB <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> overlap.</li>
          <li>Every range in the list of ranges specifying the SRGB <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
      cover or overlap with a reserved label value or range <xref target="RFC7274" format="default"/>,
      respectively.</li>
          <li>If the SRGB of a node does not conform to the structure specified
      in this section or to the previous two rules, the SRGB <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
      be completely ignored by all routers in the routing domain, and the
      node <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be treated as if it does not have an SRGB.</li>
          <li>The list of label ranges <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> only be used to instantiate global
      SIDs into the MPLS forwarding plane.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>
   A local segment <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be allocated from the Segment Routing Local Block
   (SRLB) <xref target="RFC8402" format="default"/> or from any unused label as long as it does not use
   a special-purpose label. The SRLB consists of the range of local
   labels reserved by the node for certain local segments.  In a
   controller-driven network, some controllers or applications <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> use
   the control plane to discover the available set of Local SIDs on a
   particular router <xref target="ROUTING-POLICY" format="default"/>. The rules
   applicable to the SRGB are also applicable to the SRLB, except the
   SRGB <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> only be used to instantiate global
   SIDs into the MPLS forwarding plane. The recommended, minimum, or
   maximum size of the SRGB and/or SRLB is a matter of future study.</t>

        <name>Incoming Label Collision</name>
        <t>
   The MPLS Architecture <xref target="RFC3031" format="default"/> defines the term Forwarding
   Equivalence Class (FEC) as the set of packets with similar and/or
   identical characteristics that are forwarded the same way and are
   bound to the same MPLS incoming (local) label. In Segment Routing
   MPLS, a local label serves as the SID for a given FEC.</t>
        <t>
   We define SR FEC <xref target="RFC8402" format="default"/> as one of the following:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>(Prefix, Routing Instance, Topology, Algorithm) <xref target="RFC8402" format="default"/>, where a
      topology identifies a set of links with metrics. For the purpose
      of incoming label collision resolution, the same Topology
      numerical value <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be used on all routers to identify the same
      set of links with metrics. For MCCs where the "Topology" and/or
      "Algorithm" fields are not defined, the numerical value of zero
      <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be used for these two fields. For the purpose of incoming
      label collision resolution, a routing instance is identified by a
      single incoming label downloader to the FIB. Two MCCs running on the
      same router are considered different routing instances if the only
      way the two instances know about each other's incoming labels
      is through redistribution. The numerical value used to identify a
      routing instance <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be derived from other configuration or <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be
      explicitly configured. If it is derived from other configuration,
      then the same numerical value <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be derived from the same
      configuration as long as the configuration survives router reload.
      If the derived numerical value varies for the same configuration,
      then an implementation <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> make the numerical value used to
      identify a routing instance configurable.</li>
          <li>(next hop, outgoing interface), where the outgoing interface is
      physical or virtual.</li>
          <li>(number of adjacencies, list of next hops, list of outgoing
      interfaces IDs in ascending numerical order). This FEC represents
      parallel adjacencies <xref target="RFC8402" format="default"/>.</li>
          <li>(Endpoint, Color). This FEC represents an SR Policy <xref target="RFC8402" format="default"/>.</li>
          <li>(Mirror SID). The Mirror SID (see <xref target="RFC8402" sectionFormat="comma" section="5.1"/>) is the IP
      address advertised by the advertising node to identify the Mirror SID.
      The IP address is encoded as specified in <xref target="convert-section-2.5.1" format="default"/>.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>
   This section covers the <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> procedure for handling the scenario
   where, because of an error/misconfiguration, more than one SR FEC as
   defined in this section maps to the same incoming MPLS label.
   Examples illustrating the behavior specified in this section can be
   found in <xref target="convert-section-a.2" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>

   An incoming label collision occurs if the SIDs of the set of FECs
   {FEC1, FEC2, ..., FECk} map to the same incoming SR MPLS label "L1".</t>
        <t>
   Suppose an anycast prefix is advertised with a Prefix-SID by some,
   but not all, of the nodes that advertise that prefix. If the Prefix-SID
   sub-TLVs result in mapping that anycast prefix to the same
   incoming label, then the advertisement of the Prefix-SID by some, but
   not all, of the advertising nodes <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be treated as a label
   collision.</t>
        <t>
   An implementation <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> allow the MCCs belonging to the same
   router to assign the same incoming label to more than one SR FEC.</t>
        <t>
   The objective of the following steps is to deterministically install
   in the MPLS Incoming Label Map, also known as label FIB, a single FEC
   with the incoming label "L1". By "deterministically install", we mean
   if the set of FECs {FEC1, FEC2,..., FECk} map to the same incoming SR
   MPLS label "L1", then the steps below assign the same FEC to the
   label "L1" irrespective of the order by which the mappings of this
   set of FECs to the label "L1" are received. For example, first-
   come, first-served tiebreaking is not allowed. The remaining FECs may
   be installed in the IP FIB without an incoming label.</t>
        <t>
   The procedure in this section relies completely on the local FEC and
   label database within a given router.</t>
        <t>
   The collision resolution procedure is as follows:</t>

        <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
          <li>Given the SIDs of the set of FECs, {FEC1, FEC2,..., FECk} map to
      the same MPLS label "L1".</li>
          <li>
            <t>Within an MCC, apply tiebreaking rules to select one FEC only, and
      assign the label to it. The losing FECs are handled as if no
      labels are attached to them. The losing FECs with algorithms other
      than the shortest path first <xref target="RFC8402" format="default"/> are not installed in the
      FIB.
            </t>
            <ol spacing="normal" type="a">
              <li> If the same set of FECs are attached to the same label "L1",
          then the tiebreaking rules <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> always select the same FEC
          irrespective of the order in which the FECs and the label "L1"
          are received. In other words, the tiebreaking rule <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be
          deterministic.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>If there is still collision between the FECs belonging to
      different MCCs, then reapply the tiebreaking rules to the
      remaining FECs to select one FEC only, and assign the label to that
      FEC.</li>
          <li>Install the selected FEC into the IP FIB and its incoming label into
        the label FIB.</li>
          <li>The remaining FECs with the default algorithm (see the
      Prefix-SID algorithm specification <xref target="RFC8402" format="default"/>) may be installed
      in the FIB natively, such as pure IP entries in case of Prefix
      FEC, without any incoming labels corresponding to their SIDs. The
      remaining FECs with algorithms other than the shortest path first
      <xref target="RFC8402" format="default"/> are not installed in the FIB.</li>
        </ol>

          <name>Tiebreaking Rules</name>

   The default tiebreaking rules are specified as follows:</t>

          <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
            <li>Determine the lowest administrative distance among the competing FECs as defined in the section below. Then filter away all the competing FECs with a higher administrative distance.</li>

      determined according to the FEC encoding described later in this
      section.</li>
          </ol>

   These rules deterministically select which FEC to install in the MPLS
   forwarding plane for the given incoming label.</t>

   This document defines the default tiebreaking rules that <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be

   rules.</t>

        <name>Effect of Incoming Label Collision on Outgoing Label Programming</name>

   When determining what outgoing label to use, the ingress node
   that pushes new segments, and hence a stack of MPLS labels, <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use, for
   a given FEC, the label that has been selected by the node
   receiving the packet with that label exposed as the top label. So in case
   of incoming label collision on this receiving node, the ingress node
   <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> resolve this collision by using this same "Incoming Label Collision resolution procedure" and by using the data of the receiving node.</t>
        <t>
   In the general case, the ingress node may not have the exact same
   data as the receiving node, so the result may be different. This is
   under the responsibility of the network operator. But in a typical
   case, e.g., where a centralized node or a distributed link-state IGP
   is used, all nodes would have the same database. However, to minimize
   the chance of misforwarding, a FEC that loses its incoming label to
   the tiebreaking rules specified in <xref target="convert-section-2.5" format="default"/> <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be

  SID  "Si" is represented by the global index "I" and owned by the router Ri.  Neighbor "N" may be directly

<!--Fyi, AD approval needed for the sentence below-->
   An example of a method to determine the SID

   prefix "P" in TLV 135, and the top label of the incoming packet
   matches the MPLS label in the FIB corresponding to the SID "Si" on

          <t>
   As specified in <xref target="convert-section-2.7.3" format="default"/>, the NEXT operation corresponds to popping
   the topmost label. The forwarding behavior is as follows:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>Pop the topmost label</li>
            <li>Apply the instruction associated with the incoming label that has
      been popped</li>
          </ul>
          <t>
   The action on the packet after popping the topmost label depends on
   the instruction associated with the incoming label as well as the
   contents of the packet right underneath the top label that was
   popped. Examples of the NEXT operation are described in <xref target="convert-section-a.1" format="default"/></t>

        <name>Forwarding Behavior for Local SIDs</name>
        <t>
   This section specifies the forwarding behavior for Local SIDs when SR
   is instantiated over the MPLS forwarding plane.</t>
        <section anchor="convert-section-2.11.1" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Forwarding for the PUSH Operation on Local SIDs</name>
          <t>
   Suppose an MCC on router "R0" determines that the PUSH operation is to
   be applied to an incoming packet using the Local SID "Si" before
   sending the packet towards neighbor "N", which is directly connected to R0
   through a physical or virtual interface such as a UDP tunnel <xref target="RFC7510" format="default"/>
   or L2TPv3 tunnel <xref target="RFC4817" format="default"/>.</t>
          <t>
   An example of such a Local SID is an Adj-SID allocated and advertised
   by IS-IS <xref target="RFC8667" format="default"/>. The method by
   which the MCC on "R0" determines that the PUSH operation is to be applied
   to the incoming packet is beyond the scope of this document. An
   example of such a method is the backup path used to protect against a
   failure using TI-LFA <xref target="FAST-REROUTE" format="default"/>.</t>
          <t>
   As mentioned in <xref target="RFC8402" format="default"/>, a Local SID is specified by an MPLS label.
   Hence, the PUSH operation for a Local SID is identical to the label push
   operation using any MPLS label <xref target="RFC3031" format="default"/>. The forwarding action after
   pushing the MPLS label corresponding to the Local SID is also
   determined by the MCC. For example, if the PUSH operation was done to
   forward a packet over a backup path calculated using TI-LFA, then the
   forwarding action may be sending the packet to a certain neighbor
   that will in turn continue to forward the packet along the backup
   path.</t>

   A Local SID on router "R0" corresponds to a local label.
   In such a
   scenario, the outgoing label towards next hop "N" is determined by
   the MCC running on the router "R0", and the forwarding behavior for the

   Suppose R1 wants to send IPv4 packet P1 to R8. In this case, R1
   needs to apply the PUSH operation to the IPv4 packet.</t>
        <t>
   Remember that the SID index "8" is a global IGP segment attached to
   the IP prefix 192.0.2.8/32. Its semantic is global within the IGP
   domain: any router forwards a packet received with active segment 8
   to the next hop along the ECMP-aware shortest path to the related
   prefix.</t>
        <t>
   R2 is the next hop along the shortest path towards R8. By applying
   the steps in <xref target="convert-section-2.8" format="default"/>, the outgoing label downloaded to R1's FIB
   corresponding to the global SID index "8" is 1008 because the SRGB of
   R2 = [1000,5000] as shown in <xref target="fig2" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>
   Because the packet is IPv4, R1 applies the PUSH operation using the
   label value 1008 as specified in <xref target="convert-section-2.10.1" format="default"/>. The resulting MPLS
   header will have the "S" bit <xref target="RFC3032" format="default"/> set because it is followed
   directly by an IPv4 packet.</t>
        <t>
   The packet arrives at router R2.

 Because top label 1008
   corresponds to the IGP SID index "8", which is the Prefix-SID attached to
   the prefix 192.0.2.8/32 owned by Node R8, the instruction
   associated with the SID is "forward the packet using one of the ECMP interfaces or next hops along the shortest path(s) towards R8". Because R2 is not the penultimate hop, R2
   applies the CONTINUE operation to the packet and sends it to R3 using
   one of the two links connected to R3 with top label 1008 as specified
   in <xref target="convert-section-2.10.1" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>
   R3 receives the packet with top label 1008. Because top label
   1008 corresponds to the IGP SID index "8", which is the Prefix-SID attached
   to the prefix 192.0.2.8/32 owned by Node R8, the instruction
   associated with the SID is "send the packet using one of the ECMP interfaces and next hops along the shortest path towards R8". Because R3
   is the penultimate hop, we assume that R3 performs penultimate hop
   popping, which corresponds to the NEXT operation; the packet is then sent to 
   R8. The NEXT operation results in popping the outer label
   and sending the packet as a pure IPv4 packet to R8.</t>
        <t>
   In conclusion, the path followed by P1 is R1-R2--R3-R8.  The ECMP
   awareness ensures that the traffic is load-shared between any ECMP
   path; in this case, it's the two links between R2 and R3.</t>

   IS-IS on Node A receives a Prefix-SID Advertisement from Node C for
   203.0.113.222/32 with index=22. Assuming that the IS-IS SRGB on Node A
   = [1000,1999], the corresponding incoming label is 1022.</t>
          <t>

   FEC1 wins based on the lowest numerical prefix value.  This means that
   Node A installs a transit MPLS forwarding entry to swap incoming
   label 1022 with outgoing label N and to use outgoing interface I. N is
   determined by the index associated with FEC1 (index=22) and the SRGB
   advertised by the next-hop node on the shortest path to reach
   203.0.113.122/32.</t>
          <t>
   Node A will generally also install an imposition MPLS forwarding
   entry corresponding to FEC1 for incoming prefix=203.0.113.122/32
   pushing outgoing label N, and using outgoing interface I.</t>
          <t>
   The rule in <xref target="convert-section-2.6" format="default"/> means Node A <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> install an ingress
   MPLS forwarding entry corresponding to FEC2 (the losing FEC, which
   would be for prefix 203.0.113.222/32).</t>

          <name>Example 2</name>
          <t>
   The following example illustrates the effect of incoming label collision resolution on
   outgoing label programming on Node A.</t>
          <t>
   FEC1:</t>
       
            <t>SR Policy Advertisement from the controller to Node A.
            Endpoint address=192.0.2.80, color=100, SID-List=&lt;S1, S2&gt;, and 
            Binding-SID label=1023.
          </t>
          <t>
   FEC2:</t>
          <t>
            SR Policy Advertisement from controller to Node A.
            Endpoint address=192.0.2.81, color=100, SID-List=&lt;S3, S4&gt;, and
            Binding-SID label=1023.
          </t>
     
          <t>
   FEC1 wins by having the lower numerical endpoint address value. This
   means that Node A installs a transit MPLS forwarding entry to swap
   incoming label=1023 with outgoing labels, and the outgoing interface
   is determined by the SID-List for FEC1.</t>
          <t>
   In this example, we assume that Node A receives two BGP/VPN routes:</t>

          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>R1 with VPN label=V1, BGP next hop = 192.0.2.80, and color=100</li>
            <li>R2 with VPN label=V2, BGP next hop = 192.0.2.81, and color=100</li>
          </ul>
          <t>
   We also assume that Node A has a BGP policy that matches color=100
   and allows its usage as Service Level Agreement (SLA) steering information. In this case,
   Node A will install a VPN route with label stack = &lt;S1,S2,V1&gt;
   (corresponding to FEC1).</t>
          <t>
   The rule described in <xref target="convert-section-2.6" format="default"/> means that Node A <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> install
   a VPN route with label stack = &lt;S3,S4,V1&gt; (corresponding to FEC2.)</t>
