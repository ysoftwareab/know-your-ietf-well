      <t>The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used to transmit media in
      multimedia telephony applications. These applications are typically
      required to implement congestion control. This document describes the
      test cases to be used in the performance evaluation of such congestion
      control algorithms in a controlled environment.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>This memo describes a set of test cases for evaluating congestion
      control algorithm proposals in controlled environments for real-time
      interactive media. It is based on the guidelines enumerated in <xref target="RFC8868" format="default"/> and the requirements discussed
      in <xref target="RFC8836" format="default"/>. The test cases cover
      basic usage scenarios and are described using a common structure, which
      allows for additional test cases to be added to those described herein
      to accommodate other topologies and/or the  modeling of different path
      characteristics. The described test cases in this memo should be used to
      evaluate any proposed congestion control algorithm for real-time
      interactive media.</t>

      <t>All the test cases in this document follow a basic structure allowing
      implementers to describe a new test scenario without repeatedly
      explaining common attributes. The structure includes a general
      description section that describes the test case and its motivation.
      Additionally the test case defines a set of attributes that characterize
      the testbed, for example, the network path between communicating peers
      and the diverse traffic sources.</t>

              should also indicate the time granularity (e.g., averaged over
              10 ms, 100 ms, or 1 s) for measuring certain metrics. Typical
              measurement interval is 200 ms.</dd>

          <dt>Define testbed topology:</dt><dd> 
          <t><br/></t>
          <t>Every test case needs to define an
          evaluation testbed topology. <xref target="fig-eval-topo" format="default"/> shows
          such an evaluation topology. In this evaluation topology, S1..Sn are
          traffic sources. These sources generate media traffic and use the
          congestion control algorithm(s) under investigation. R1..Rn are the
          corresponding receivers. A test case can have one or more such
          traffic sources (S) and their corresponding receivers (R). The path
          from the source to destination is denoted as "forward", and the path
          from a destination to a source is denoted as "backward". The
          following basic structure of the test case has been described from
          the perspective of media-generating endpoints attached on the
          left-hand side of <xref target="fig-eval-topo" format="default"/>. In this setup, the
          media flows are transported in the forward direction, and the corresponding
          feedback/control messages are transported in the backward direction.
          However, it is also possible to set up the test with media in both
          forward and backward directions. In that case, unless otherwise
          specified by the test case, it is expected that the backward path
          does not introduce any congestion-related impairments and has enough
          capacity to accommodate both media and feedback/control messages. It
          should be noted that, depending on the test cases, it is possible to
          have different path characteristics in either of the
          directions.</t>

          <t>In a testbed environment with real equipment, there may
          exist a significant amount of unwanted traffic on the portions of
          the network path between the endpoints. Some of this traffic may be
          generated by other processes on the endpoints themselves (e.g.,
          discovery protocols) or by other endpoints not presently under test.
          Such unwanted traffic should be removed or avoided to the greatest
          extent possible.</t>

                      Different video scenarios give different distributions of

                        150 Kbps - 1.5 Mbps. In real-life
                        applications, the bit rate range can vary a lot
                        depending on the provided service; for example, the
                        maximum bit rate can be up to 4 Mbps. However, for
                        running tests to evaluate the congestion control
                        algorithms, it is more important to have a look at how
                        they react to a certain amount of bandwidth
                        change. Also it is possible that the media traffic

                        not capable of generating a higher bit rate. Hence, we
                        have selected a suitable bit rate range typical of
                        consumer-grade video conferencing applications in
                        designing the test case. If a different bit rate range
                        is used in the test cases, then the end-to-end path

        <name>Variable Available Capacity with a Single Flow</name>
        <t>In this test case, the minimum bottleneck-link capacity between the two
        endpoints varies over time. This test is designed to measure the
        responsiveness of the candidate algorithm. This test tries to address
        the requirements in <xref target="RFC8836" format="default"/>,
        which requires the algorithm to adapt the flow(s) and provide lower
        end-to-end latency when there exists: </t>

          <li>an intermediate bottleneck</li>
          <li>change in available capacity (e.g., due to interface change,
            routing change, abrupt arrival/departure of background
            non-adaptive traffic)</li>
          <li>maximum media bit rate is greater than link capacity. In this
            case, when the application tries to ramp up to its maximum bit
            rate, since the link capacity is limited to a lower value, the
            congestion control scheme is expected to stabilize the sending bit
            rate close to the available bottleneck capacity.</li>
          </ul>
        <t>It should be noted that the exact variation in available
        capacity due to any of the above depends on the underlying
        technologies. Hence, we describe a set of known factors, which may be
        extended to devise a more specific test case targeting certain
        behaviors in a certain network environment.</t>

        <dt>Expected behavior:</dt><dd>The candidate algorithm is expected to detect
        the path capacity constraint, converge to the bottleneck link's
        capacity, and adapt the flow to avoid unwanted media rate oscillation
        when the sending bit rate is approaching the bottleneck link's
        capacity. Such oscillations might occur when the media flow(s)
        attempts to reach its maximum bit rate but overshoots the usage of the
        available bottleneck capacity, then to rectify, it reduces the bit rate
        and starts to ramp up again.</dd>

        <name>Competing Media Flows with the Same Congestion Control Algorithm</name>
        <t>In this test case, more than one media flow share the bottleneck
        link, and each of them uses the same congestion control algorithm. This
        is a typical scenario where a real-time interactive application sends
        more than one media flow to the same destination, and these flows are
        multiplexed over the same port. In such a scenario, it is likely that
        the flows will be routed via the same path and need to share the
        available bandwidth amongst themselves. For the sake of simplicity, it
        is assumed that there are no other competing traffic sources in the
        bottleneck link and that there is sufficient capacity to accommodate
        all the flows individually. While this appears to be a variant of the
        test case defined in <xref target="VACM" format="default"/>, it focuses 
        on the capacity-sharing aspect of the candidate algorithm. The previous test case, on
        the other hand, measures adaptability, stability, and responsiveness

        <dt>Expected behavior:</dt><dd>It is expected that the competing flows will
        converge to an optimum bit rate to accommodate all the flows with
        minimum possible latency and loss. Specifically, the test introduces
        three media flows at different time instances. When the second flow
        appears, there should still be room to accommodate another flow on the
        bottleneck link. Lastly, when the third flow appears, the bottleneck
        link should be saturated.</dd>

        <t>In this test case, multiple media flows share the bottleneck link,
        but the one-way propagation delay for each flow is different. For the
        sake of simplicity, it is assumed that there are no other competing
        traffic sources in the bottleneck link and that there is sufficient
        capacity to accommodate all the flows. While this appears to be a
        variant of test case 5.2 (<xref target="VACM" format="default"/>), 
        it focuses on the capacity-sharing aspect of
        the candidate algorithm under different RTTs.</t>
<dl spacing="normal">
  <dt>Expected behavior:</dt><dd>It is expected that the competing flows will
        converge to bit rates to accommodate all the flows with minimum
        possible latency and loss. The effectiveness of the algorithm depends
        on how fast and fairly the competing flows converge to their steady
        states irrespective of the RTT observed.</dd>

        <name>Media Flow Competing with Short TCP Flows</name>
        <t>In this test case, one or more congestion-controlled media flows
        share the bottleneck link with multiple short-lived TCP flows.
        Short-lived TCP flows resemble the on/off pattern observed in web
        traffic, wherein clients (for example, browsers) connect to a server
        and download a resource (typically a web page, few images, text files,
        etc.) using several TCP connections. This scenario shows the
        performance of a multimedia application when several browser windows
        are active. The test case measures the adaptivity of the candidate
        algorithm to competing web traffic, and it addresses requirement 1.E
        in <xref target="RFC8836" section="2" sectionFormat="of" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>Depending on the number of short TCP flows, the cross traffic
        either appears as a short burst flow or resembles a long-lived TCP flow. The
        intention of this test is to observe the impact of a short-term burst on
        the behavior of the candidate algorithm.</t>
<dl spacing="normal">
  <dt>Expected behavior:</dt><dd> The candidate algorithm is expected to avoid
        flow starvation during the presence of short and bursty competing TCP
        flows, streaming at least at the minimum media bit rate. After
        competing TCP flows terminate, the media streams are expected to be
        robust enough to eventually recover to previous steady state behavior,
        and at the very least, avoid persistent starvation.</dd>

        <name>Media Pause and Resume</name>
        <t>In this test case, more than one real-time interactive media flow
        share the link bandwidth, and all flows reach to a steady state by
        utilizing the link capacity in an optimum way. At this stage, one of
        the media flows is paused for a moment. This event will result in more
        available bandwidth for the rest of the flows as they are on a shared
        link. When the paused media flow resumes, it no longer has the
        same bandwidth share on the link. It has to make its way through the
        other existing flows in the link to achieve a fair share of the link
        capacity. This test case is important specially for real-time
        interactive media, which consists of more than one media flows and can
        pause/resume media flows at any point of time during the session. This
        test case directly addresses requirement 5 in 
        <xref target="RFC8836" section="2" sectionFormat="of" format="default"/>. One can think of it as a

        However, it is different as the
        candidate algorithms can use different strategies to increase 
        efficiency, for example, in terms of fairness, convergence time,

      <t>The security considerations in <xref target="RFC8868" section="6" sectionFormat="of" format="default"/> and the relevant congestion
      control algorithms apply. The principles for congestion control are
      described in <xref target="RFC2914" format="default"/>, and in particular any new method
      must implement safeguards to avoid congestion collapse of the
      Internet.</t>
      <t>The evaluation of the test cases are intended to be run in a
      controlled lab environment. Hence, the applications, simulators, and
      network nodes ought to be well-behaved and should not impact the desired
      results. Moreover, proper measures must be taken to avoid leaking
      nonresponsive traffic from unproven congestion avoidance techniques
      onto the open Internet.</t>
