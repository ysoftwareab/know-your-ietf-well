      <t>Data models provide a programmatic approach to represent services and
      networks. Concretely, they can be used to derive configuration
      information for network and service components, and state information
      that will be monitored and tracked. 

Data models can be used during the service and network management life cycle
(e.g., service instantiation, service provisioning, service optimization,
service monitoring, service diagnosing, and service assurance).

Data models are also instrumental in the automation of network management, and
they can provide closed-loop control for adaptive and deterministic service
creation, delivery, and maintenance.</t>
      <t>This document describes a framework for service and network
      management automation that takes advantage of YANG modeling
      technologies. This framework is drawn from a network operator
      perspective irrespective of the origin of a data model; thus, it can 
      accommodate YANG modules that are developed outside the IETF.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>




      <t>Service management systems usually comprise service
      activation/provision and service operation. Current service delivery
      procedures, from the processing of customer requirements and orders to
      service delivery and operation, typically assume the manipulation of
      data sequentially into multiple Operations Support System (OSS) or
      Business Support System (BSS) applications that may be managed by
      different departments within the service provider's organization (e.g.,
      billing factory, design factory, network operation center). Many of
      these applications have been developed in house over the years and
      operate in a silo mode. As a result:</t>


      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>The lack of standard data input/output (i.e., data model) raises
          many challenges in system integration and often results in manual
          configuration tasks.</li>
        <li>Service fulfillment systems might have a limited visibility on
          the network state and may therefore have a slow response to network
          changes.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>Software-Defined Networking (SDN) becomes crucial to address these
      challenges. SDN techniques are meant to automate the overall service
      delivery procedures and typically rely upon standard data models.  These
      models are used not only to reflect service providers' savoir faire, but
      also to dynamically instantiate and enforce a set of service-inferred
      policies that best accommodate what has been defined and possibly
      negotiated with the customer. <xref target="RFC7149" format="default"/>
      provides a first tentative attempt to rationalize that service
      provider's view on the SDN space by identifying concrete technical
      domains that need to be considered and for which solutions can be
      provided. These include: </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>Techniques for the dynamic discovery of topology, devices, and
          capabilities, along with relevant information and data models that
          are meant to precisely document such topology, devices, and their
          capabilities.</li>
        <li>Techniques for exposing network services <xref target="RFC8309"
        format="default"/> and their characteristics.</li>
        <li>Techniques used by service-derived dynamic resource allocation
          and policy enforcement schemes, so that networks can be programmed
          accordingly.</li>
        <li>Dynamic feedback mechanisms that are meant to assess how
          efficiently a given policy (or a set thereof) is enforced from a
          service fulfillment and assurance perspective.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>Models are key for each of the four technical items above.
      Service and network management automation is an important step to
      improve the agility of network operations. Models are also important to
      ease integrating multi-vendor solutions.</t>
      <t>YANG module <xref target="RFC7950" format="default"/> developers have
      taken both top-down and bottom-up approaches to develop modules <xref
      target="RFC8199" format="default"/> and to establish a mapping between a
      network technology and customer requirements at the top or abstracting
      common constructs from various network technologies at the bottom. 


At the time of writing this document (2020), there are many YANG data models,
including configuration and service models, that have been specified or are
being specified by the IETF. They cover many of the networking protocols and
techniques. However, how these models work together to configure a function,
manage a set of devices involved in a service, or provide a service is
something that is not currently documented either within the IETF or other
Standards Development Organizations (SDOs).</t>
      <t>Many of the YANG modules listed in this document are used to exchange
      data between NETCONF/RESTCONF clients and servers <xref target="RFC6241"
      format="default"/><xref target="RFC8040"
      format="default"/>. Nevertheless, YANG is a transport-independent data
      modeling language. It can thus be used independently of
      NETCONF/RESTCONF. For example, YANG can be used to define abstract data
      structures <xref target="RFC8791" format="default"/> that can be
      manipulated by other protocols (e.g., <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dots-rfc8782-bis" format="default"/>).</t>
      <t>This document describes an architectural framework for service and
      network management automation (<xref target="concept"
      format="default"/>) that takes advantage of YANG modeling technologies
      and investigates how YANG data models at different layers interact with
      each other (e.g., Service Mapping, model composition) in the context of
      service delivery and fulfillment (<xref target="compo"
      format="default"/>). Concretely, the following benefits can be provided:
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>Vendor-agnostic interfaces managing a service and the
          underlying network are allowed.</li>
        <li>Movement from deployment schemes where vendor-specific network
          managers are required to a scheme where the entities that are
          responsible for orchestrating and controlling services and network
          resources provided by multi-vendor devices are unified is allowed.</li>
        <li>Data inheritance and reusability among the various
          architecture layers thus promoting a network-wise provisioning
          instead of device-specific configuration is eased.</li>
        <li>Dynamically feeding a decision-making process (e.g., Controllers,
          Orchestrators) with notifications that will trigger appropriate
          actions, allowing that decision-making process to continuously
          adjust a network (and thus the involved resources) to deliver the
          service that conforms to the intended parameters (service
          objectives) is allowed.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>This framework is drawn from a network operator perspective
      irrespective of the origin of a data model; it can also accommodate YANG
      modules that are developed outside the IETF. The document covers service
      models that are used by an operator to expose its services and capture
      service requirements from the customers (including other operators).
      Nevertheless, the document does not elaborate on the communication
      protocol(s) that makes use of these service models in order to request
      and deliver a service. Such considerations are out of scope.</t>
      <t>The document identifies a list of use cases to exemplify the proposed
      approach (<xref target="examples" format="default"/>), but it does not claim nor
      aim to be exhaustive. <xref target="app" format="default"/> lists some examples to
      illustrate the layered YANG modules view.</t>

        <t>As described in <xref target="RFC8199"
	sectionFormat="of" section="2"/>,
        layering of modules allows for better reusability of lower-layer
        modules by higher-level modules while limiting duplication of features
        across layers.</t>
        <t>Data models in the context of network management can be classified
        into service, network, and device models. Different service models may
        rely on the same set of network and/or device models.</t>
        <t>Service models traditionally follow a top-down approach and are
        mostly customer-facing YANG modules providing a common model construct
        for higher-level network services (e.g., Layer 3 Virtual Private
        Network (L3VPN)). Such modules can be mapped to network
        technology-specific modules at lower layers (e.g., tunnel, routing,
        Quality of Service (QoS), security). For example, service models can
        be used to characterize the network service(s) to be ensured between
        service nodes (ingress/egress) such as: </t>
        <ul spacing="compact">

          <li>the communication scope (pipe, hose, funnel, etc.),</li>
          <li>the directionality (inbound/outbound),</li>
          <li>the traffic performance guarantees expressed using metrics such
            as One-Way Delay (OWD) <xref target="RFC7679" format="default"/> or One-Way
            Loss <xref target="RFC7680" format="default"/>; a summary of performance
            metrics maintained by IANA can be found in <xref target="IPPM" format="default"/>,</li>
          <li>link capacity <xref target="RFC5136" format="default"/> <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-capacity-metric-method" format="default"/>,</li>
          <li>etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <t><xref target="service_ex" format="default"/> depicts the example of
        a Voice over IP (VoIP) service that relies upon connectivity services
        offered by a network operator. In this example, the VoIP service is
        offered to the network operator's customers by Service Provider 1
        (SP1). In order to provide global VoIP reachability, SP1 Service Site
        interconnects with other Service Providers service sites typically by
        interconnecting Session Border Elements (SBEs) and Data Border
        Elements (DBEs) <xref target="RFC5486" format="default"/><xref
        target="RFC6406" format="default"/>. For other VoIP destinations,
        sessions are forwarded over the Internet. These connectivity services
        can be captured in a YANG service model that reflects the service
        attributes that are shown in <xref target="service_ex2"/>. This example follows
        the IP Connectivity Provisioning Profile template defined in <xref
        target="RFC7297" format="default"/>.</t>

        devices and their subsystems, and relevant protocols operating at the
        link and network layers across multiple devices (e.g., network
        topology and traffic-engineering tunnel modules).</t>
        <t>Device (and function) models usually follow a bottom-up approach
        and are mostly technology-specific modules used to realize a service

        by lower levels (see for example, <xref target="app"
        format="default"/>).  Mechanisms such as the YANG library <xref

        <t/>
        <t>A composite service offered by a network operator may rely on
        services from other operators. In such a case, the network operator acts
        as a customer to request services from other networks. The operators
        providing these services will then follow the layering depicted in
        <xref target="layering" format="default"/>. The mapping between a
        composite service and a third-party service is maintained at the
        orchestration level. From a data-plane perspective, appropriate
        traffic steering policies (e.g., Service Function Chaining <xref
        target="RFC7665" format="default"/>) are managed by the network
        controllers to guide how/when a third-party service is invoked for
        flows bound to a composite service.</t>
        <t>The layering model depicted in <xref target="layering" format="default"/> does
        not make any assumption about the location of the various entities
        (e.g., Controller, Orchestrator) within the network. As such, the
        architecture does not preclude deployments where, for example, the
        Controller is embedded on a device that hosts other functions that are
        controlled via YANG modules.</t>
        <t>In order to ease the mapping between layers and data reuse, this
        document focuses on service models that are modeled using YANG.
        Nevertheless, fully compliant with <xref target="RFC8309"
        sectionFormat="of" section="3"/>, <xref target="layering"
        format="default"/> does not preclude service models to be modeled
        using data modeling languages other than YANG.</t>

        <name>Automation of Service Delivery Procedures</name>
        <t>Service models can be used by a network operator to expose its
        services to its customers. Exposing such models allows automation of the
        activation of service orders and thus the service delivery. One or
        more monolithic service models can be used in the context of a
        composite service activation request (e.g., delivery of a caching
        infrastructure over a VPN). Such models are used to feed a
        decision-making intelligence to adequately accommodate customer        needs.</t>
        <t>Also, such models may be used jointly with services that require
        dynamic invocation. An example is provided by the service modules
        defined by the DOTS WG to dynamically trigger requests to handle
        Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks <xref target="RFC8783"
        format="default"/>. The service filtering request modeled using <xref
        target="RFC8783" format="default"/> will be translated into
        device-specific filtering (e.g., ACLs defined in <xref
        target="RFC8519" format="default"/>) that fulfills the service
        request.</t>

<t>
 Network models can be derived from service models and used to provision,
 monitor, and instantiate the service. Also, they are used to provide
 life-cycle management of network resources.  Doing so is meant to:
</t>


        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>expose network resources to customers (including other network
            operators) to provide service fulfillment and assurance.</li>
          <li>allow customers (or network operators) to dynamically adjust the
          network resources based on service requirements as described in
          service models (e.g., <xref target="service_ex2" />) and the
          current network performance information described in the telemetry
          modules.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>Note that it is out of the scope of this document to elaborate on
        the communication protocols that are used to implement the interface
        between the service ordering (customer) and service order handling
        (provider).</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="ful" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Service Fulfillment Automation</name>
        <t>To operate a service, the settings of the parameters in the device
        models are derived from service models and/or network models and are
        used to:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Provision each involved network function/device with the proper
            configuration information.</li>
          <li>Operate the network based on service requirements as described
            in the service model(s) and local operational guidelines.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>In addition, the operational state including configuration that is
        in effect together with statistics should be exposed to upper layers
        to provide better network visibility and assess to what extent the
        derived low-level modules are consistent with the upper-level
        inputs.</t>
        <t>Filters are enforced on the notifications that are communicated to
        Service layers. The type and frequency of notifications may be agreed
        upon in the service model.</t>

        <t>Note that it is important to correlate telemetry data with
        configuration data to be used for closed loops at the different stages
        of service delivery, from resource allocation to service operation, in
        particular.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="int" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>YANG Module Integration</name>
        <t>To support top-down service delivery, YANG modules at different
        levels or at the same level need to be integrated for proper
        service delivery (including proper network setup). For example, the
        service parameters captured in service models need to be decomposed
        into a set of configuration/notification parameters that may be
        specific to one or more technologies; these technology-specific
        parameters are grouped together to define technology-specific
        device-level models or network-level models.</t>

        <t>In addition, these technology-specific device or network models can
        be further integrated with each other using the schema mount mechanism
        <xref target="RFC8528" format="default"/> to provision each involved network
        function/device or each involved network domain to support newly added
        modules or features. A collection of integrated device models 
        can be loaded and validated during implementation.</t>
        <t>High-level policies can be defined at service or network models
        (e.g., "Autonomous System Number (ASN) Exclude" in the example
        depicted in <xref target="service_ex2"/>). Device models will be tweaked accordingly
        to provide policy-based management. Policies can also be used for
        telemetry automation, e.g., policies that contain conditions to
        trigger the generation and pushing of new telemetry data.</t>

          "Network Service") is some form of connectivity between customer sites
          and the Internet or between customer sites across the operator's
          network and across the Internet.</t>
          <t>Service exposure is used to capture services offered to customers
          (ordering and order handling). One example is that a customer can
          use an L3VPN Service Model (L3SM) to request L3VPN service by
          providing the abstract technical characterization of the intended
          service between customer sites.</t>

          <t>Service model catalogs can be created to expose the various
          services and the information needed to invoke/order a given
          service.</t>

          <name>Service Creation/Modification</name>
          <t>A customer is usually unaware of the technology that the network
          operator has available to deliver the service, so the customer does
          not make requests specific to the underlying technology but is
          limited to making requests specific to the service that is to be
          delivered. This service request can be filled using a service
          model.</t>
          <t>Upon receiving a service request, and assuming that appropriate
          authentication and authorization checks have been made with success,
          the service Orchestrator/management system should verify whether the
          service requirements in the service request can be met (i.e.,
          whether there are sufficient resources that can be allocated with
          the requested guarantees).</t>
          <t>If the request is accepted, the service Orchestrator/management
          system maps such a service request to its view. This view can be
          described as a technology-specific network model or a set of
          technology-specific device models, and this mapping may include a
          choice of which networks and technologies to use depending on which
          service features have been requested.</t>
          <t>In addition, a customer may require a change in the underlying
          network infrastructure to adapt to new customers' needs and service
          requirements (e.g., service a new customer site, add a new access
          link, or provide disjoint paths). This service modification can be
          issued following the same service model used by the service
          request.</t>

          <t>The performance measurement telemetry (<xref target="tele"

          <name>Service Optimization</name>
          <t>Service optimization is a technique that gets the configuration
          of the network updated due to network changes, incident mitigation,
          or new service requirements. One example is once a tunnel or a VPN
          is set up, performance monitoring information or telemetry
          information per tunnel (or per VPN) can be collected and fed into
          the management system. If the network performance doesn't meet the
          service requirements, the management system can create new VPN
          policies capturing network service requirements and populate them
          into the network.</t>
          <t>Both network performance information and policies can be modeled
          using YANG. With Policy-based management, self-configuration and
          self-optimization behavior can be specified and implemented.</t>
          <t>The overall service optimization is managed at the service level,
          while the network level is responsible for the optimization of the
          specific network services it provides.</t>

          <name>Service Diagnosis</name>
          <t>Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) are important
          networking functions for service diagnosis that allow network
          operators to:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>monitor network communications (i.e., reachability
              verification and Continuity Check)</li>

              localization)</li>
            <li>monitor service level agreements and performance (i.e.,
              performance management)</li>
          </ul>
          <t>When the network is down, service diagnosis should be in place to
          pinpoint the problem and provide recommendations (or instructions)
          for network recovery.</t>
          <t>The service diagnosis information can be modeled as
          technology-independent Remote Procedure Call (RPC) operations for
          OAM protocols and technology-independent abstraction of key OAM
          constructs for OAM protocols <xref target="RFC8531" format="default"/><xref target="RFC8533" format="default"/>. These models can be used to provide

          <name>Intended Configuration Provision</name>
          <t>Intended configuration at the device level is derived from
          network models at the network level or service models at the service
          level and represents the configuration that the system attempts to
          apply. Take L3SM as a service model example to deliver an L3VPN
          service; there is a need to map the L3VPN service view defined in
          the service model into a detailed intended configuration view
          defined by specific configuration models for network elements. The
          configuration information includes:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) definition, including
              VPN policy expression</li>
            <li>Physical Interface(s)</li>
            <li>IP layer (IPv4, IPv6)</li>
            <li>QoS features such as classification, profiles, etc.</li>
            <li>Routing protocols: support of configuration of all protocols
              listed in a service request, as well as routing policies
              associated with those protocols</li>
            <li>Multicast support</li>
            <li>Address sharing</li>
            <li>Security (e.g., access control, authentication,
              encryption)</li>
          </ul>
          <t>These specific configuration models can be used to configure
          Provider Edge (PE) and Customer Edge (CE) devices within a site,
          e.g., a BGP policy model can be used to establish VPN membership
          between sites and VPN service topology.</t>
          <t>Note that in networks with legacy devices (that support
          proprietary modules or do not support YANG at all), an adaptation
          layer is likely to be required at the network level so that these
          devices can be involved in the delivery of the network services.</t>

          <t>Configuration validation is used to validate intended

          <t>For example, if a customer creates an interface "eth-0/0/0" but
          the interface does not physically exist at this point, then
          configuration data appears in the &lt;intended&gt; status but does

          <name>Performance Monitoring</name> <t>When a configuration is in

          complete operational state of the device, including learned, system,
          default configuration, and system state. However, the configurations
          and state of a particular device do not have visibility on the
          whole network, nor can they show how packets are going to be
          forwarded through the entire network.  Therefore, it becomes more
          difficult to operate the entire network without understanding the
          current status of the network.</t>

          <t>The management system should subscribe to updates of a YANG
          datastore in all the network devices for performance monitoring
          purposes and build a full topological visibility of the network by

          <t>When configuration is in effect in a device, some devices may be
          misconfigured (e.g., device links are not consistent in both sides
          of the network connection) or network resources might be
          misallocated. Therefore, services may be negatively affected
          without knowing the root cause in the network.</t>
          <t>Technology-dependent nodes and RPC commands are defined in
          technology-specific YANG data models, which can use and extend the

        <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>To control which state a network
        device should be in or is allowed to be in at any given time, a set of
        conditions and actions are defined and correlated with network events
        (e.g., allow the NETCONF server to send updates only when the value
        exceeds a certain threshold for the first time, but not again until
        the threshold is cleared), which constitute an Event Condition Action
        (ECA) policy or an event-driven policy control logic that can be

      <name>Security Considerations</name>

      <t>Many of the YANG modules cited in this document define schema for
      data that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols
      such as NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241" format="default"/> or RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040" format="default"/>. The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure
      transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is
      Secure Shell (SSH) <xref target="RFC6242" format="default"/>. The lowest RESTCONF
      layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
      <xref target="RFC8446" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>The NETCONF access control model <xref target="RFC8341" format="default"/>
      provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF
      users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF
      protocol operations and content.</t>
      <t>Security considerations specific to each of the technologies and
      protocols listed in the document are discussed in the specification
      documents of each of these protocols.</t>
      <t>In order to prevent leaking sensitive information and the "confused
      deputy" problem <xref target="Hardy" format="default"/> in general, special care
      should be considered when translating between the various layers in
      <xref target="compo" format="default"/> or when aggregating data retrieved from
      various sources. Authorization and authentication checks should be
      performed to ensure that data is available to an authorized entity.
      The network operator must enforce means to protect privacy-related
      information included in customer-facing models.</t>
      <t>To detect misalignment between layers that might be induced by
      misbehaving nodes, upper layers should continuously monitor the
      perceived service (<xref target="optim" format="default"/>) and should proceed with
      checks to assess that the provided service complies with the expected
      service and that the data reported by an underlying layer is matching
      the perceived service by the above layer. Such checks are the
      responsibility of the service diagnosis (<xref target="diag" format="default"/>).</t>
      <t>When a YANG module includes security-related parameters, it is
      recommended to include the relevant information as part of the service
      assurance to track the correct functioning of the security
      mechanisms.</t>
      <t>Additional considerations are discussed in the following
      subsections.</t>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Service Level</name>
        <t>A provider may rely on services offered by other providers to build
        composite services. Appropriate mechanisms should be enabled by the
        provider to monitor and detect a service disruption from these
        providers. The characterization of a service disruption (including
        mean time between failures and mean time to repair), the escalation
        procedure, and penalties are usually documented in contractual
        agreements (e.g., as described in <xref target="RFC4176"
        sectionFormat="of" section="2.1"/>). Misbehaving peer providers will
        thus be identified and appropriate countermeasures will be
        applied.</t>
        <t>The communication protocols that make use of a service model
        between a customer and an operator are out of scope. Relevant security
        considerations should be discussed in the specification documents of
        these protocols.</t>
      </section>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Network Level</name>
        <t>Security considerations specific to the network level are listed
        below:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>A controller may create forwarding loops by misconfiguring the
            underlying network nodes. It is recommended to proceed with tests
            to check the status of forwarding paths regularly or whenever
            changes are made to routing or forwarding processes. Such checks
            may be triggered from the service level owing to the means
            discussed in <xref target="diag" format="default"/>.</li>
          <li>Some service models may include a traffic isolation clause that
          is passed down to the network level so that appropriate
          technology-specific actions must be enforced at the underlying
          network (and thus involved network devices) to avoid that such
          traffic is accessible to non-authorized parties. In particular,
          network models may indicate whether encryption is enabled and, if so,
          expose a list of supported encryption schemes and parameters.  Refer,
          for example, to the encryption feature defined in <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common" format="default"/> and its use
          in <xref target="I-D.ietf-opsawg-l3sm-l3nm" format="default"/>.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Device Level</name>
        <t>Network operators should monitor and audit their networks to detect
        misbehaving nodes and abnormal behaviors. For example, OAM, as
        discussed in <xref target="diag" format="default"/>, can be used for
        that purpose.</t>
        <t>Access to some data requires specific access privilege levels.
        Devices must check that a required access privilege is provided before
        granting access to specific data or performing specific actions.</t>

      <name>Layered YANG Module Examples Overview</name>
      <t>This appendix lists a set of YANG data models that can be used for
      the delivery of connectivity services. These models can be classified as
      service, network, or device models.</t>
      <t>It is not the intent of this appendix to provide an inventory of
      tools and mechanisms used in specific network and service management
      domains; such inventory can be found in documents such as <xref target="RFC7276" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>The reader may refer to the YANG Catalog (&lt;<eref
      target="https://www.yangcatalog.org"/>&gt;) or the public Github YANG
      repository (&lt;<eref target="https://github.com/YangModels/yang"/>&gt;) to
      query existing YANG models. The YANG Catalog includes some metadata to
      indicate the module type ('module-classification') <xref
      target="I-D.clacla-netmod-model-catalog" format="default"/>. Note that
      the mechanism defined in <xref target="RFC8819" format="default"/>
      allows to associate tags with YANG modules in order to help classifying
      the modules.</t>

        <name>Service Models: Definition and Samples</name>

        <t>As described in <xref target="RFC8309" format="default"/>, the
        service is "some form of connectivity between customer sites and the
        Internet or between customer sites across the network operator's
        network and across the Internet". More concretely, an IP connectivity
        service can be defined as the IP transfer capability characterized by
        a (Source Nets, Destination Nets, Guarantees, Scope) tuple where
        "Source Nets" is a group of unicast IP addresses, "Destination Nets"
        is a group of IP unicast and/or multicast addresses, and "Guarantees"
        reflects the guarantees (expressed, for example, in terms of QoS,
        performance, and availability) to properly forward traffic to the said
        "Destination" <xref target="RFC7297" format="default"/>. The "Scope"
        denotes the network perimeter (e.g., between Provider Edge (PE)
        routers or Customer Nodes) where the said guarantees need to be
        provided.</t>


        <t>For example:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>The L3SM <xref target="RFC8299" format="default"/> defines the L3VPN
            service ordered by a customer from a network operator.</li>
          <li>The L2SM <xref target="RFC8466" format="default"/> defines the L2VPN
            service ordered by a customer from a network operator.</li>
          <li>The Virtual Network (VN) model <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-teas-actn-vn-yang" format="default"/> provides a
          YANG data model applicable to any mode of VN operation.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>L2SM and L3SM are customer service models as per <xref target="RFC8309" format="default"/>.</t>

        <name>Schema Mount</name>
        <t>Modularity and extensibility were among the leading design
        principles of the YANG data modeling language. As a result, the same
        YANG module can be combined with various sets of other modules and
        thus form a data model that is tailored to meet the requirements of a
        specific use case. <xref target="RFC8528" format="default"/> defines a mechanism,
        denoted "schema mount", that allows for mounting one data model
        consisting of any number of YANG modules at a specified location of
        another (parent) schema.</t>
