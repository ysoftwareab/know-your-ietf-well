    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a YANG data model for configuring and managing
      routing policies in a vendor-neutral way. The model provides a generic
      routing policy framework that can be extended for specific routing
      protocols using the YANG 'augment' mechanism.

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>This document describes a YANG data model <xref target="RFC7950"
      format="default"/> for routing policy configuration based on
      operational usage and best practices in a variety of service provider
      networks.  The model is intended to be vendor neutral to allow operators
      to manage policy configuration consistently in environments with routers
      supplied by multiple vendors.
      </t>
      <t> The YANG modules in this document conform to the Network Management
      Datastore Architecture (NMDA) <xref target="RFC8342"/>.</t>
      <section anchor="goals" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Goals and Approach</name>
        <t>
      This model does not aim to be feature complete; it is a
      subset of the policy configuration parameters available
      in a variety of vendor implementations but supports widely
      used constructs for managing how routes are imported,
      exported, and modified across different routing protocols.
      The model development approach has been to examine actual
      policy configurations in use across several operator
      networks.  Hence, the focus is on enabling policy configuration
      capabilities and structure that are in wide use.
        </t>
        <t>
      Despite the differences in details of policy expressions and
      conventions in various vendor implementations, the model
      reflects the observation that a relatively simple condition-action
      approach can be readily mapped to several existing vendor
      implementations and also gives operators a familiar and 
      straightforward way to express policy. A side effect of this design 
      decision is that other methods for expressing policies are not 
      considered.
        </t>
        <t>
      Consistent with the goal to produce a data model that is vendor
      neutral, only policy expressions that are deemed to be widely
      available in prevalent implementations are included in the
      model.  Those configuration items that are only available from
      a single implementation are omitted from the model with the
      expectation they will be available in separate vendor-provided
      modules that augment the current model.

      <t>
      The routing policy module has three main parts:
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          A generic framework is provided to express policies as sets of
          related conditions and actions. This includes match sets and actions
          that are useful across many routing protocols.
          </li>

        <li>
          A structure that allows routing protocol models to add
          protocol-specific policy conditions and actions through YANG
          augmentations is also provided.  There is a complete example of
          this for <xref target="RFC4271" format="default">BGP</xref> policies
          in the proposed vendor-neutral <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-model"
          format="default">BGP data model</xref>.  <xref target="augment"/> provides an
          example of how an augmentation for BGP policies might be
          accomplished. Note that this section is not normative, as the BGP
          model is still evolving.
          </li>
        <li>
          Finally, a reusable grouping is defined for attaching import and
          export rules in the context of routing configuration for different
          protocols, Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) instances, etc.  This also enables the creation of policy
          chains and the expression of default policy behavior. In this document,
          policy chains are sequences of policy definitions that are
	  applied in order (described in <xref target="expression" format="default"/>).
          </li>
      </ul>
      <t>
        The module makes use of the standard Internet types,
        such as IP addresses, autonomous system numbers, etc.,
        defined in <xref target="RFC6991" format="default">RFC 6991</xref>.

      <t>
      Policies are expressed as a sequence of top-level policy
      definitions, each of which consists of a sequence of policy statements.
      Policy statements in turn consist of simple condition-action
      tuples. Conditions may include multiple match or comparison
      operations, and similarly, actions may include multiple changes to
      route attributes or indicate a final disposition of accepting
      or rejecting the route.  This structure is shown below.

        The model provides a collection of generic sets that can be used for
        matching in policy conditions.  These sets are applicable for
        route selection across  multiple routing protocols. They may be
        further augmented by protocol-specific models that have their
        own defined sets. The defined sets include:
        </t>
<dl>

<dt>prefix sets:

<dd>Each prefix set defines a set of IP prefixes, each with an associated IP
prefix and netmask range (or exact length).
</dd>

<dt>neighbor sets:

<dd>Each neighbor set defines a set of neighboring nodes by their IP
addresses. A neighbor set is used for selecting routes based on the neighbors
advertising the routes.
</dd>

<dt>tag sets:

matches for selecting routes.

      <section anchor="conditions" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Policy Conditions</name>
        <t>
        Policy statements consist of a set of conditions and actions
        (either of which may be empty).  Conditions are used to
        match route attributes against a defined set (e.g., a prefix
        set) or to compare attributes against a specific value.  
        </t>
        <t>
        Match conditions may be further modified using the
        match-set-options configuration, which allows network operators to
        change the behavior of a match. Three options are supported:
        </t>
   <dl>
<dt>'all':
</dt>
<dd>Match is true only if the given value matches all members of the set.
</dd>

<dt>'any':
</dt>
<dd>Match is true if the given value matches any member of the set.
</dd>

<dt>'invert':
</dt>
<dd>Match is true if the given value does not match any member of the given set.
</dd>


   </dl>
    
    <t>
        Not all options are appropriate for matching against all
        defined sets (e.g., match 'all' in a prefix set does not make sense).
        In the model, a restricted set of match options is used where
        applicable.
        </t>
        <t>
        Comparison conditions may similarly use options to change how route
        attributes should be tested, e.g., for equality or inequality, against
        a given value.
        </t>
        <t>
        While most policy conditions will be added by individual
        routing protocol models via augmentation, this routing policy
        model includes several generic match conditions and the
        ability to test which protocol or mechanism installed a route
        (e.g., BGP, IGP, static, etc.).  The conditions included in
        the model are shown below.

        <name>Policy Subroutines</name>
        <t>
        Policy 'subroutines' (or nested policies) are
        supported by allowing policy statement conditions to reference
        other policy definitions using the call-policy configuration.
        Called policies apply their conditions and
        actions before returning to the calling policy statement and
        resuming evaluation.  The outcome of the called policy affects
        the evaluation of the calling policy.  If the called policy
        results in an accept-route,
        then the subroutine returns an effective Boolean true value to
        the calling policy.  For the calling policy, this is equivalent
        to a condition statement evaluating to a true value, thus the calling party
        continues in its evaluation of the policy 
        (see <xref target="evaluation" format="default"/>).  Note that
        the called policy may also modify attributes of the route in
        its action statements. Similarly, a reject-route action
        returns false, and the calling policy evaluation will be
        affected accordingly. When the end of the subroutine policy
        statements is reached, the default route disposition
        action is returned (i.e., Boolean false for reject-route).
        Consequently, a subroutine cannot
        explicitly accept or reject a route. Rather, the called policy
        returns Boolean true if its outcome is accept-route or Boolean
        false if its outcome is reject-route. Route
        acceptance or rejection is solely determined by the top-level
        policy.
        </t>
        <t>
        Note that the called policy may itself call other policies (subject to
        implementation limitations).  The model does not prescribe a nesting
        depth because this varies among implementations. For example, an
        implementation may only support a single level of subroutine
        recursion. As with any routing policy construction, care must be taken
        with nested policies to ensure that the effective return value results
        in the intended behavior.  Nested policies are a convenience in many
        routing policy constructions, but creating policies nested beyond a
        small number of levels (e.g., two to three) is discouraged. Also,
        implementations <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> perform validation to ensure that there is
        no recursion among nested routing policies.
        </t>
      </section>

    <section anchor="evaluation" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Policy Evaluation</name>
      <t>
      Evaluation of each policy definition proceeds by evaluating its
      individual policy statements in the order that they are defined.  When all
      the condition statements in a policy statement are satisfied, the
      corresponding action statements are executed.  If the actions
      include either accept-route or reject-route actions,
      evaluation of the current policy definition stops, and no further
      policy statement is evaluated. If there are multiple policies
      in the policy chain, subsequent policies are not
      evaluated.  Policy chains are sequences of
      policy definitions (as described in <xref target="expression" format="default"/>).
      </t>
      <t>
      If the conditions are not satisfied, then evaluation proceeds to
      the next policy statement.  If none of the policy statement
      conditions are satisfied, then evaluation of the current policy
      definition stops, and the next policy definition in the chain is
      evaluated. When the end of the policy chain is reached, the
      default route disposition action is performed (i.e., reject-route
      unless an alternate default action is specified for the
      chain).
      </t>
      <t>
      Whether the route's pre-policy attributes are used for testing policy
      statement conditions is dependent on the implementation-specific value
      of the match-modified-attributes leaf. If match-modified-attributes is
      false and actions modify route attributes, these modifications are not
      used for policy statement conditions.  Conversely, if
      match-modified-attributes is true and actions modify the policy
      application-specific attributes, the attributes as modified by the
      policy are used for policy condition statements.
      </t>

      <name>Applying Routing Policy</name>
      <t>
      Routing policy is applied by defining and attaching policy chains in
      various routing contexts.  Policy chains are sequences of policy
      definitions (described in <xref target="expression" format="default">
      </xref>). They can be referenced from different contexts. For example, a
      policy chain could be associated with a routing protocol and used to
      control its interaction with its protocol peers, or it could be used to
      control the interaction between a routing protocol and the local routing
      information base.  A policy chain has an associated direction (import or
      export) with respect to the context in which it is referenced.</t>
      <t>The routing policy model defines an apply-policy grouping that
      can be imported and used by other models.  As shown below, it
      allows definition of import and export policy chains, as well as
      specifies the default route disposition to be used when no
      policy definition in the chain results in a final decision.

  description
    "This module describes a YANG data model for routing policy
     configuration. It is a limited subset of all of the policy
     configuration parameters available in the variety of vendor
     implementations, but supports widely used constructs for
     managing how routes are imported, exported, modified, and
     advertised across different routing protocol instances or
     within a single routing protocol instance.  This module is
     intended to be used in conjunction with routing protocol
     configuration modules (e.g., BGP) defined in other models.

     This YANG module conforms to the Network Management
     Datastore Architecture (NMDA), as described in RFC 8342.

     The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL
     NOT', 'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'NOT RECOMMENDED',
     'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in this document are to be interpreted as
     described in BCP 14 (RFC 2119) (RFC 8174) when, and only when,
     they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

      <t>The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
      that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such as
      NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241" format="default"/> or RESTCONF <xref
      target="RFC8040" format="default"/>.  The lowest NETCONF layer is the
      secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport
      is Secure Shell (SSH) <xref target="RFC6242" format="default"/>.  The
      lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
      transport is TLS <xref target="RFC8446" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) <xref target="RFC8341"
      format="default"/> provides the means to restrict access for particular
      NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available
      NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol operations and content.</t>
      <t>There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
        writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
        default). These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
        in some network environments. Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
        to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
        effect on network operations. These are the subtrees and data nodes
        and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

<dd>Modification to prefix sets could result in a Denial-of-Service (DoS)
attack. An attacker may try to modify prefix sets and redirect or drop
traffic. Redirection of traffic could be used as part of a more elaborate
attack to either collect sensitive information or masquerade a
service. Additionally, a control plane DoS attack could be accomplished by
allowing a large number of routes to be leaked into a routing protocol domain
(e.g., BGP).
</dd>

</dd>

<dt>/routing-policy/defined-sets/tag-sets 
</dt>
<dd>Modification to the tag sets could be used to mount a DoS attack. Routes
with certain tags might be redirected or dropped. The implications are similar
to prefix sets and neighbor sets. However, the attack may be more difficult to
detect as the routing policy usage of route tags and intent must be understood
to recognize the breach. Conversely, the implications of prefix set or
neighbor set modification are easier to recognize.
</dd>

<dt>/routing-policy/policy-definitions/policy-definition/statements/statement/conditions

<dd>Modification to the conditions could be used to mount a DoS attack or
other attack.  An attacker may change a policy condition and redirect or drop
traffic.  As with prefix sets, neighbor sets, or tag sets, traffic redirection
could be used as part of a more elaborate attack.
</dd>

<dt>/routing-policy/policy-definitions/policy-definition/statements/statement/actions
</dt>
<dd>Modification to actions could be used to mount a DoS attack or other
attack. Traffic may be redirected or dropped.  As with prefix sets,
neighbor sets, or tag sets, traffic redirection could be used as part of a
more elaborate attack.  Additionally, route attributes may be changed to mount
a second-level attack that is more difficult to detect.

  <t>Some of the readable data nodes in the YANG module may be
        considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
        It is thus important to control read access (e.g., via get,
        get-config, or notification) to these data nodes. These are the
        subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
      </t>

<dd>Knowledge of these data nodes can be used to ascertain local neighbors
against whom to mount a DoS attack.
</dd>

<dt>/routing-policy/policy-definitions/policy-definition/statements/
</dt>
<dd>Knowledge of these data nodes can be used to attack the local router with

policies themselves could represent intellectual property and disclosure could
diminish their corresponding business advantage.

      <t>Routing policy configuration has a significant impact on network

      <name>Routing Protocol-Specific Policies</name>
      <t>
      Routing models that require the ability to apply routing policy
      may augment the routing policy model with protocol or other
      specific policy configuration.  The routing policy model
      assumes that additional defined sets, conditions, and actions
      may all be added by other models.
      </t>
      <t>
      The example below illustrates how another data 
      model can augment parts of this routing policy data model. It uses 
      specific examples from draft-ietf-idr-bgp-model-09 to show in a 
      concrete manner how the different pieces fit together. This example 
      is not normative with respect to <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-model" format="default"/>. 
      The model similarly augments BGP-specific conditions and actions 
      in the corresponding sections of the routing policy model. In the example below,
      the XPath prefix "bp:" specifies import from the ietf-bgp-policy
      sub-module and the XPath prefix "bt:" specifies import from the ietf-bgp-types
      sub-module <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-model" format="default"/>.

      <t>
      Below, we show examples of XML-encoded configuration data using
      the routing policy and BGP models to illustrate both how policies
      are defined and how they can be applied.  Note that the XML <xref target="W3C.REC-xml11" format="default"/>
      has been simplified for readability.
      </t>
      <t>The following example shows how prefix set and tag set can be
      defined. The policy condition is to match a prefix set and a
      tag set, and the action is to accept routes that match the condition.</t>
