      <t>This document defines a YANG data model that can be used to configure 
      and manage Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) <xref target="RFC5880"
      format="default"></xref>. BFD is a network protocol that is used
      for liveness detection of arbitrary paths between systems. Some examples
      of different types of paths over which we have BFD are as follows:</t> 

     <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
      <li>Two systems directly connected via IP. This is known as BFD over
      single-hop IP, a.k.a.&nbsp;<xref target="RFC5881" format="default">BFD for
      IPv4 and IPv6</xref>.</li>
      <li>Two systems connected via multiple hops as described in <xref
      target="RFC5883" format="default">"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
      (BFD) for Multihop Paths"</xref>.</li>
      <li>Two systems connected via MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) as
      described in <xref target="RFC5884" format="default">"Bidirectional
      Forwarding Detection (BFD) for MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs)"</xref>.</li>
      <li>Two systems connected via a Link Aggregation Group (LAG) interface
      as described in <xref target="RFC7130" format="default">"Bidirectional
      Forwarding Detection (BFD) on Link Aggregation Group (LAG) Interfaces"</xref>.</li>
      <li>Two systems connected via pseudowires (PWs). This is known as
      Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV), as described in <xref
      target="RFC5885" format="default">"Bidirectional
      Forwarding Detection (BFD) for the Pseudowire Virtual
      Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV)"</xref>. This scenario is not
      addressed in this document.</li>
     </ol>
      <t>BFD typically does not operate on its own. Various control protocols,
      also known as BFD clients, use the services provided by BFD for their
      own operation, as described in <xref target="RFC5882"
      format="default">"Generic Application of Bidirectional Forwarding
      Detection (BFD)"</xref>. The obvious
      candidates that use BFD are those that do not have "hellos" to detect
      failures, e.g., static routes, and routing protocols whose "hellos" do
      not support sub-second failure detection, e.g., OSPF and IS-IS.</t> 
      <t>The YANG modules in this document conform to the <xref
      target="RFC8342" format="default">Network Management Datastore
      Architecture (NMDA)</xref>. This means that the data models do not have
      separate top-level or sibling containers for configuration data and
      operational state data.</t>

        <name>Tree Diagrams</name>
        <t>This document uses the graphical representation of data models, as defined in

      <name>Design of the Data Model</name>
      <t>Since BFD is used for liveness detection of various forwarding
      paths, there is no uniform key to identify a BFD session, and so the BFD
      data model is split into multiple YANG modules where each module
      corresponds to one type of forwarding path. For example, BFD for IP
      single-hop is in one YANG module, and BFD for MPLS is in another YANG
      module. The main difference between these modules is how a BFD session
      is uniquely identified, i.e., the key for the list containing the BFD
      sessions for that forwarding path. To avoid duplication of BFD
      definitions, we have common types and groupings that are used by all
      the modules.</t>
      <t>A new control-plane protocol, "bfdv1", is defined, and a "bfd" container
      is created under "control-plane-protocol" as specified in <xref
      target="RFC8349" format="default">"A YANG Data Model for Routing
      Management (NMDA Version)"</xref>. This new "bfd" container is augmented
      by the following YANG modules for their respective specific information:
      </t> 
      <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
        <li>The "ietf-bfd-ip-sh" module (<xref target="bfd-ip-single-hop-module"/>) augments
          "/routing/control-plane-protocols/control-plane-protocol/bfd/" with
          the "ip-sh" container for BFD sessions over IP single-hop.</li>
        <li>The "ietf-bfd-ip-mh" module (<xref target="bfd-ip-multihop-module"/>) augments
          "/routing/control-plane-protocols/control-plane-protocol/bfd/" with
          the "ip-mh" container for BFD sessions over IP multihop.</li>
        <li>The "ietf-bfd-lag" module (<xref target="bfd-over-lag-module"/>) augments
          "/routing/control-plane-protocols/control-plane-protocol/bfd/" with
          the "lag" container for BFD sessions over a LAG.</li>
        <li>The "ietf-bfd-mpls" module (<xref target="bfd-over-mpls-module"/>) augments
          "/routing/control-plane-protocols/control-plane-protocol/bfd/" with
          the "mpls" container for BFD-over-MPLS LSPs.</li>
      </ol>
      <t>BFD can operate in the following contexts:</t>
      <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
        <li>At the network device level.</li>
        <li>In logical network elements (LNEs) as described in <xref
        target="RFC8530" format="default">"YANG Model for Logical Network Elements"</xref>.</li>
        <li>In network instances as described in <xref
        target="RFC8529" format="default">"YANG Data Model for Network Instances"</xref>.</li> 
      </ol>
      <t> When used at the network device level, the BFD YANG data model is
        used "as is". When the BFD YANG data model is used in an LNE or network instance, the BFD YANG data model augments
        the mounted routing model for the LNE or network instance.</t>
      <section anchor="CFG-MODEL" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Design of the Configuration Model</name>
        <t>The configuration model consists mainly of the parameters specified
        in <xref target="RFC5880" format="default">BFD</xref> -- for example, desired
        minimum transmit interval, required minimum receive interval, and
        detection multiplier.</t>
        <t>BFD clients are applications that use BFD for fast detection of
        failures. Some implementations have BFD session configuration under
        the BFD clients -- for example, BFD session configuration under routing
        applications such as OSPF, IS-IS, or BGP. Other implementations have
        BFD session configuration centralized under BFD, i.e., outside the
        multiple BFD clients.</t>
        <t>The main BFD parameters of interest to a BFD client are those
        related to the
        multiplier and interval(s), since those parameters impact the
        convergence time of the BFD clients when a failure occurs. Other
        parameters, such as BFD authentication, are not specific to the
        requirements of the BFD client. Configuration of BFD for all
        clients should be centralized. However, this is a problem for BFD clients
        that auto-discover their peers. For example, IGPs do not have the
        peer address configured; instead, the IGP is enabled on an interface,
        and the IGP peers are auto-discovered. So, for an operator to configure
        BFD to an IGP peer, the operator would first have to determine the
        peer addresses. And when a new peer is discovered, BFD configuration
        would need to be added. To avoid this issue, we define the grouping
        "client-cfg-parms" in <xref target="BFD-TYPES" format="default"/> for BFD clients to
        configure BFD: this allows BFD clients, such as the IGPs, to have
        configuration (multiplier and intervals) for the BFD sessions they
        need. For example, when a new IGP peer is discovered, the IGP would
        create a BFD session to the newly discovered peer; similarly, when
        an IGP peer goes away, the IGP would remove the BFD session to that
        peer. The mechanism for how the BFD sessions are created and removed by
        the BFD clients is outside the scope of this document, but
        this would typically be done by using an API implemented by the BFD module on
        the system. In the case of BFD clients that create BFD sessions via their own
        configuration, authentication parameters (if required) are still
        specified in BFD.</t>
        <section anchor="BFD-COMMON-CFG" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Common BFD Configuration Parameters</name>
          <t>The basic BFD configuration parameters are as follows:</t>
          <dl newline="true" spacing="normal">
            <dt>local-multiplier</dt>
            <dd>This is the detection time multiplier as defined in <xref
            target="RFC5880" format="default">BFD</xref>.</dd> 
            <dt>desired-min-tx-interval</dt>
            <dd>This is the Desired Min TX Interval as defined in <xref
            target="RFC5880" format="default">BFD</xref>.</dd> 
            <dt>required-min-rx-interval</dt>
            <dd>This is the Required Min RX Interval as defined in <xref
            target="RFC5880" format="default">BFD</xref>.</dd> 
          </dl>
          <t>Although <xref target="RFC5880" format="default">BFD</xref>
          allows for different values for transmit and receive intervals, some 
          implementations allow users to specify just one interval that is
          used for both transmit and receive intervals, or separate values for
          transmit and receive intervals. The BFD YANG data model supports this:
          there is a choice between "min-interval", used for both transmit and
          receive intervals, and "desired-min-tx-interval" and
          "required-min-rx-interval". This is supported via the
          "base-cfg-parms" grouping (<xref target="BFD-TYPES"/>), which
          is used by the YANG modules for the various forwarding paths.</t>
          <t>For BFD authentication, we have the following:</t>
          <dl newline="true" spacing="normal">
            <dt>key-chain</dt>
            <dd>This is a reference to "key-chain" as defined in <xref
            target="RFC8177" format="default">"YANG Data Model for Key
            Chains"</xref>. The keys, cryptographic algorithms, key lifetime,
            etc. are all defined in the "key-chain" model.</dd> 
            <dt>meticulous</dt>
            <dd>This enables a meticulous mode as per <xref target="RFC5880"
            format="default">BFD </xref>.</dd>

          contains a list of IP single-hop sessions where each session is
          uniquely identified by the interface and destination address
          pair. We use the configuration parameters defined in
          <xref target="BFD-COMMON-CFG" format="default"/>. The "ip-sh" node
          also contains a list of interfaces and is used to specify
          authentication parameters for BFD sessions that are created by BFD
          clients. See <xref target="CFG-MODEL" format="default"/>.</t> 
          <t><xref target="RFC5880" format="default"/> and <xref

          the Echo function operates continuously or on demand. Therefore, the mechanism used to
          start and stop the Echo function is implementation specific and should
          be done by augmentation:</t> 
          <ol spacing="normal" type="1">

        <t>The operational state model contains both the overall statistics for
        the BFD sessions running on the device and the per-session operational
        information.</t>
        <t>The overall statistics for the BFD sessions consist of the number of BFD
        sessions, the number of BFD sessions that are up, etc. This information is available
        globally (i.e., for all BFD sessions) under the "bfd" node

        <t>For each BFD session, three main categories of operational state
        data are shown.</t>

       <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
       <li>The first category includes fundamental information regarding a BFD session, such as
        the local discriminator, the remote discriminator, and the ability to
        support Demand mode.</li>

        <li>The
        second category includes BFD "session-running" information, e.g., the
        remote BFD state and the diagnostic code received. Another example is
        the actual transmit interval between the control packets, which may be
        different from the configured desired minimum transmit
        interval. Similar examples include the actual receive interval
        between the control packets and the actual transmit interval between
        the Echo packets.</li>
        <li> The third category contains the detailed statistics
        for the session, e.g., when the session transitioned up/down and how
        long it has been in that state.</li>
       </ol>

        <t>For some path types, there may be more than one session on the
        virtual path to the destination. For example, with IP multihop and
        MPLS LSPs, there could be multiple BFD sessions from the source to the
        same destination to test the various paths (ECMP) to the destination.
        This is represented by having multiple "sessions" under each

        <t>An "mpls" node is added under the "bfd" node in
        "control-plane-protocol". The configuration is per MPLS FEC under this
        "mpls" node. In the operational state model, we support multiple BFD
        sessions per MPLS FEC (ECMP); the local discriminator is used as the key.
        The "mpls" node can be used in a network device (top level) or can be
        mounted in an LNE or network instance.</t>

     <t>The YANG modules specified in this document define a schema for data
that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
as NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/> or RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/>.
The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer, and the
mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH)
<xref target="RFC6242"/>. The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the
mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS <xref target="RFC8446"/>.</t>
     <t>The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) <xref target="RFC8341"/>
provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users
to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
operations and content.</t>
<!-- End YANG security DNE text (paragraphs 1 and 2) -->
<!-- Begin YANG security DNE paragraph 3 (OK) -->
     <t>There are a number of data nodes defined in these YANG modules that are
writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the default). These
data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
environments. Write operations (e.g., edit-config) to these data nodes without
proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations. These are
the subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability from a write access perspective:</t>

      <t>The YANG modules have writable data nodes that can be used for the
      creation of BFD sessions and the modification of BFD session parameters. The
      system should "police" the creation of BFD sessions to prevent new sessions
      from causing existing BFD sessions to fail. In the case of BFD session
      modification, the BFD protocol has mechanisms in place that allow for
      in-service modification.</t>
      <t>When BFD clients are used to modify BFD configuration (as described
      in <xref target="CFG-MODEL" format="default"/>), the BFD clients need to
      be included in an analysis of the security properties of the system that
      uses BFD (e.g., when considering the authentication and authorization of
      control actions). In many cases, BFD is not the most vulnerable portion
      of such a composite system, since BFD is limited to generating
      well-defined traffic at a fixed rate on a given path; in the case of an
      IGP acting as a BFD client, attacking the IGP could cause more broad-scale
      disruption than would (de)configuring a BFD session.</t> 
<!-- Begin YANG security DNE paragraph 4 (OK) -->
      <t>Some of the readable data nodes in these YANG modules may be considered
      sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus
      important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
      notification) to these data nodes. These are the subtrees and data nodes
      and their sensitivity/vulnerability from a read access perspective:</t>
