Abstract

This document specifies requirements for implementation of Internet 
Media Guide (IMG) over Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) because 
there are still different concepts about applications and technical 
implementation of IMG. Triple Play Services (TPS) for IPTV need more 
efficient and integrated IMG than existent IMG for ordinary TV. Such 
variations raise not only the question of compatibility between 
different vendors of IMG systems, but bring the confusion at consumer 
side: which one system is most suitable to viewers and what are the 
criteria for suitability of IPTV IMG system for viewers. These 
requirements are designed to guide choice and development of IMG 
feature.

1 Introduction

   Recently, IPTV - Internet protocol television - refers to the 
delivery of digital television and other audio and video services 
over broadband data networks using the same basic protocols that 
support the internet.

There is nothing new about the idea of using internet technology to 
deliver video, but internet protocol television should not be 
confused with the web experience of streaming video, which has 
generally fallen far short of anything we might expect to see on 
television.

With increasing broadband access speeds, together with improvements 
in digital video compression, it is now possible to deliver high-
quality video services over a telephone line. A small decoder box can 
connect a television to a telephone or network point, rather than an 
serial socket, cable or satellite feed, and in theory the pictures 
should be just as good. Using new advanced compression schemes, in 
the future it will even be possible to deliver high-definition 
television in this way.

While the public internet may not currently be able to guarantee the
quality of service necessary for live broadcasts, it is certainly 
possible to download programs to a local storage device.

A number of start-ups are already looking to exploit the opportunity 
to cut out cable companies and provide a package of programming 
without incurring the massive capital expenditure associated with 
building their own network. Significantly, it becomes economically 
viable to reach a global market, even with niche material.

The IMG (Internet Media Guide) imports programming information from 
broadcaster or transmitter sources. The viewers can then search, 
filter, sort, and select programs for immediate or future viewing. 
The IMG file is accessed through the IMG loader, or it is streamed 
steadily for immediate IMG content refreshing in case of interactive 
IMG that gathers IMG information through IP networks.

An IMG is used to describe a set of multimedia services (e.g. 
television program schedules, content delivery schedules) but may 
also refer to other networked resources including web pages. IMGs 
provide the envelope for metadata formats and session descriptions 
defined elsewhere with the aim of facilitating structuring, 
versioning, referencing, distributing, and maintaining (caching, 
updating) such information.

The EPG metadata may be delivered to a potentially large audience, 
who use it to join a subset of the sessions described, and who may 
need to be notified of changes to this information. Hence, a 
framework for distributing EPG metadata in various different ways is 
needed to accommodate the needs of different audiences: For 
traditional broadcast-style scenarios, multicast-based (push) 
distribution of EPG metadata needs to be supported. Where no 
multicast is available, unicast-based push is required, too.  
Furthermore, IMG metadata may need to be retrieved interactively, 
similar to web pages (e.g. after rebooting a system or when a user is 
browsing after network connectivity has been re-established).  
 Finally, IMG metadata may be updated as time elapses because content 
described in the guide may be changed: for example, the airtime of an 
event such as a concert or sports event may change, possibly   
affecting the airtime of subsequent media. This may be done by  
polling the IMG sender as well as by asynchronous change 
notifications.

However, generally we expect IMG Senders to be well-connected hosts.

Finally, with many potential senders and receivers, different types  
of networks, and presumably numerous service providers, IMG metadata 
may need to be combined, split, filtered, augmented, modified, etc., 
on their way from the sender(s) to the receiver(s) to provide the 
ultimate user with a suitable selection of multimedia services  
according to her preferences, subscriptions, location, context (e.g. 
devices, access networks), etc.




2 Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

Internet Protocol Television (IPTV): Digital TV service is provided 
over IP networks such as DSL and fiber broadband access networks to 
television set. IPTV includes the use of the IGMP signaling protocol 
to switch channels, and the use of multicasting to improve efficiency 
by ensuring that only the channels that watched are transmitted to 
the subscriber. IPTV services also can include Video on demand(VOD), 
Voice of IP (VoIP), Internet, etc.

Triple Play Services (TPS): Integrated services of telephone (voice), 
Internet(data), digital TV(video) are provided to customers 
by simple and single networks. These services are combined 
close to each other.

Internet Media Guide (IMG): IMG is a generic term to describe
the formation, delivery and use of IMG metadata. The 
         definition of the IMG is intentionally left imprecise.

IMG Element: The smallest atomic element of metadata that can be
             transmitted separately by IMG operations and referenced
             individually from other IMG elements.

IMG Metadata: A set of metadata consisting of one or more IMG  
           elements. IMG metadata describes the features of 
multimedia content used to enable selection of and access 
to media sessions containing content. For example, 
metadata may consist of the URI, title, airtime, 
bandwidth needed, file size, text summary, genre and 
access restrictions.

IMG Delivery: The process of exchanging IMG metadata both in
             terms of large scale and atomic data transfers.

IMG Sender: An IMG sender is a logical entity that sends IMG
             metadata to one or more IMG receivers.

IMG Receiver: An IMG receiver is a logical entity that receives
             IMG metadata from an IMG sender.

IMG Transceiver: An IMG transceiver combines an IMG receiver and
             sender. It may modify received IMG metadata or merge IMG
             metadata received from a several different IMG senders.

IMG Operation: An atomic operation of an IMG transport protocol,
             used between IMG sender(s) and IMG receiver(s) for the
             delivery of IMG metadata and for the control of IMG
             sender(s)/receiver(s).

IMG Transport Protocol: A protocol that transports IMG metadata
             from an IMG sender to IMG receiver(s).

IMG Transport Session: An association between an IMG sender and
             one or more IMG receivers within the scope of an IMG
             transport protocol. An IMG transport session involves a
             time bound series of IMG transport protocol interactions
             that provide delivery of IMG metadata from the IMG 
sender to the IMG receiver(s).


3 Types of IMG on IPTV

There are 5 types of IMG on IPTV that are considered as performed on 
premise that viewer wishes to watch certain types of programs. These 
types of IMG can be combined for more efficient IMG for example 
Ticker IMG can include Mini IMG or Text IMG.
Taking recent trends in IPTV viewing habits into account, our aim is 
to make it easier for the viewer to select programs based on various 
individual viewing habits. We would like to develop an IMG that 
combines program recommendations, sorting, and retrieval by using the 
well-known protocols such as SAP, SIP, and SDP.  


3.1 Mosaic IMG

This Mosaic IMG offers multiple channels viewing moving pictures 
simultaneously at a screen as shown in Fig.1. 

Mosaic of 8+ channels can be selected with sound at a same screen.

Other Interactive services can be inserted at a same screen.
 This Mosaic IMG can eliminate the difficulty and worry in program 
selection and make it easy for the viewer to find and watch desired 
programs from the many and varied programs available.
CH in figure means several services such as live video channel, audio 
channel, Internet channel, telephone service channel, etc.

3.2 Text IMG

     This Text IMG offers text- based multiple channels and program 
information at a screen as shown in Fig.2. 

Text IMG is in fact a table, where the TV channels are listed 
vertically, and the horizontal axis represents the time schedule for 
particular broadcast; on horizontal axis are quoted the particular 
shows too. We have chosen further, with remote control, one of the 
listed items.

3.4 Mini IMG

This Mini IMG offers the minimal information about the related 
current watching channel by viewing the text-only information as 
shown Fig.4. The Mini IMG has small overlap window on live channel 
screen that allows overseeing channel and program information and 
random channel zapping. In such situation, it becomes easy to select 
a program that one would like to watch live selected channel and the 
scheduling information of other channels. Mini IMG displays semi-
transparently over live video/audio channel service.

4 Requirements of IMG for IPTV

These requirements provide flexibility in selecting/designing IMG 
transport protocol suited to independent or dependent various 
services such as video, audio, data services, video related-data 
services, video related-VoIP services, etc.

REQ IPTV-1: Carrying different services of TPS in the IMG MUST be 
allowed

REQ IPTV-2: Delivery mechanisms SHOULD support many different  
            applications services to keep the system interoperable 
with existing applications.


REQ IPTV-3: IMG receivers MUST be allowed to communicate with any 
            services simultaneously or enable IMG receivers with 
intermittent access to network resources connectivity to 
receive and adequately maintain sufficient IMG metadata.

This document assumes that IMG senders are continually 
connected for the duration of services or intermittently 
connected.


REQ IPTV-4: The IMG delivery mechanisms MUST allow the combination of 
several types of IMG.

            This is for the purpose of extending functionality (e.g. 
several or one protocol(s) to provide all the needed 
operations). Applications can select an appropriate 
operation set to fulfill their purpose.


REQ IPTV-5: The IMG system MUST be flexible in choosing both sender 
and receiver-driven delivery schemes.

            Sender-driven delivery occurs when initial IMG metadata 
are delivered.  And the receiver-driven delivery occurs 
when customers request the specific services such as VoIP, 
Internet services.


REQ IPTV-6: The IMG system MUST allow delivery of personalized IMG.

           The IMG system must be able to deal with any variety of 
viewing habits and with their tendency to change 
according to their preferences (type of contents, media 
description, appropriate age group, etc.) and IMG configuration.
            For example, configuration of Mosaic IMG can be 
reallocated according to viewer∆s preference such as 
sports, news, drama, etc.

 These preferences could consist of filtering rules. When 
receiving these messages, the IMG sender might respond 
appropriate messages carrying a subset of IMG metadata 
which matches the IMG receiver's preferences.

For multicast and unicast cases where the IMG sender does 
not provide   customized IMG metadata, the IMG receiver 
could receive all IMG   metadata transmitted (on its 
joined channels). However, it may select   and filter the 
IMG metadata to get customized IMG metadata by its  
preferences, and thus drop unwanted metadata immediately 
upon reception.

Personalized IMG might be achieved by changing the IMG
descriptions sent and IMG receivers and/or changing the 
delivery properties (channels used).

Thus, customization, as with any feature which affects 
scalability, should be carefully designed for the intended 
application, and it may not be possible that a one-size-
fits-all solution for customization would meet the 
scalability requirements for all applications and 
deployment cases.

REQ IPTV-7: IMG metadata MUST be interoperable over any IMG transport  
 protocol, such that an application receiving the same 
metadata over any one (or more) of several network 
connections and/or IMG transport protocols will interpret 
the metadata in exactly the same way. 

REQ IPTV-8: IMG delivery MUST enable the carriage of any format of 
  application-specific metadata.

            Thus, the system will support the description of many 
kinds of multimedia content, without the need for single
 homogenous metadata syntax for all uses (which would be 
infeasible anyway). This is essential for environments 
using IMG systems to support many kinds of multimedia 
content and to achieve wide applicability.


5 Security Considerations

Security requirements of IMG for IPTV will be added to later versions 
of this I-D.   
   


6 IANA Considerations
   There are no IANA considerations within this document.
