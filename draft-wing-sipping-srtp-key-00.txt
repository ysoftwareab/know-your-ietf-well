1.  Introduction

   This document addresses 2 difficulties with end-to-end encryption of
   RTP (SRTP [RFC3711]):  transcoding and media recording.  When peering
   with other networks, different codecs are sometimes necessary
   (transcoding a surround-sound codec for transmission over a highly-
   compressed bandwidth-constrained network, for example).  In some
   environments (e.g., stock brokerages and banks) regulations and
   business needs require recording calls with coworkers or with
   customers.  In many environments, quality problems such as echo can
   only be diagnosed by listening to the call (analyzing SRTP headers is
   not sufficient).

   With an RTP stream, transcoding is accomplished by modifying SDP to
   offer a different codec through a transcoding device [RFC4117], and
   call recording or monitoring can be accomplished with an Ethernet
   sniffer listening for SIP and its associated RTP, with a media relay,
   or with a Session Border Controller.  However, when media is
   encrypted end-to-end[I-D.wing-rtpsec-keying-eval], these existing
   techniques fail because they are unable to decrypt the media packets.

   When a media session is encrypted with SRTP, there are three
   techniques to decrypt the media for monitoring or call recording:

   1.  the endpoint establishes a separate media stream to the recording
       device, with a separate SRTP key, and sends the (mixed) media to
       the recording device.  The disadvantages of this technique
       include doubling bandwidth requirements, loss of media recording
       facility doesn't cause loss of call (as is required in some
       environments).  A significant advantage of this technique,
       however, is that it's secure:  a malicious media recording device
       cannot inject media to the connected party on behalf of the
       endpoint.  Depending on the application requirements it may be
       necessary to establish a reliable connection to the recording
       device to cope with possible packet loss on the unreliable link,
       typically used for media transport.

   2.  the endpoint relays media through a device which forks a separate
       media stream to the recording device.  This technique is often
       employed by Session Border Controllers, and could also be
       employed by TURN servers.

   3.  Network sniffing devices are used to listen to the SRTP traffic
       and correlate SRTP with SIP (with cooperation of call signaling
       devices, if the call signaling is encrypted).

   This document describes cases (2) and (3) where a cooperating
   endpoints publishes its SRTP master keys to an authorized party using

   the SIP Event State Publication Extension [RFC3903].  The mechanism
   described in this paper allows secure disclosure of SRTP session keys
   to authorized parties so that an endpoints media stream can be
   transcoded or decrypted, as needed by that environment.


2.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The following terminology is taken directly from SIP Event State
   Publication Extension [RFC3903]:

   Event Publication Agent (EPA):  The User Agent Client (UAC) that
      issues PUBLISH requests to publish event state.

   Event State Compositor (ESC):  The User Agent Server (UAS) that
      processes PUBLISH requests, and is responsible for compositing
      event state into a complete, composite event state of a resource.

   Publication:  The act of an EPA sending a PUBLISH request to an ESC
      to publish event state.


3.  Operation

   For transcoding, RTP packets must be sent from and received by a
   device which performs the transcoding.  When the media is encrypted,
   this device must be capable of decrypting the media, performing the
   transcoding function, and re-encrypting the media.

      ISSUE-1:  should we consider providing some or all of the SIP
      headers, as well?  Some recording functions will need to know the
      identity of the remote party.  This information could be gleaned
      from the SIP proxies, though, and starts to fall outside the
      intended scope of this document.

      ISSUE-2:  The authors have been considering use of MIKEY
      [RFC3830], but MIKEY may not be used off the shelf.  Certain
      changes to the state machine may have to be made (RFC3830
      describes the TGK transport rather than SRTP master key
      transport).

3.1.  Learning Name and Certificate of ESC

   The endpoint will be configured with the AOR of its ESC (e.g.,
   "transcoder@example.com").  If S/MIME is used to send the SRTP master
   key to the ESC, the endpoint is additionally configured with the
   certificate of its ESC.

   This configuration is outside the scope of this document, but some
   examples are CLI, [I-D.ietf-sipping-config-framework], or
   [I-D.ietf-sip-certs].

3.2.  Sending SRTP Session Keys to ESC

   SDP is used to describe the media session to the ESC.  However, the
   existing Security Descriptions [RFC4568] only describes the master
   key and parameters of the SRTP packets being sent -- it does not
   describe the master key (and parameters) of the SRTP being received,
   or the SSRC being transmitted.  For transcoding and media recording,
   both the sending key and receiving key are needed and in some cases
   the SSRC is needed.

   Thus, we hereby extend the existing crypto attribute to indicate the
   SSRC.  We also create a new SDP attribute, "rcrypto", which is
   identical to the existing "crypto" attribute, except that it
   describes the receiving keys and their SSRCs.  For example:

     a=crypto:1 AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_32
       inline:NzB4d1BINUAvLEw6UzF3WSJ+PSdFcGdUJShpX1Zj|2^20|1:32
       SSRC=1899
     a=rcrypto:1 AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_32
       inline:AmO4q1OVAHNiYRj6HmS3JFWNCFqSpTqHWKKIN1Mw|2^20|1:32
       SSRC=3289
     a=rcrypto:1 AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_32
       inline:Hw3JFWNCFqSpTqNiYRj6HmSWKMHAmO4q1KIN1OVA|2^20|1:32
       SSRC=4893


                           Figure 1: Example SDP

   The full SDP, including the keying information, is then sent to the
   ESC.  The keying information MUST be encrypted and integrity
   protected.  Existing mechanisms such as S/MIME [RFC3261] and SIPS
   [I-D.ietf-sip-sips] MAY be used to achieve this goal, or other
   mechanisms may be defined.

   [[ ISSUE-3:  if a endpoint is receiving multiple incoming streams
      from multiple endpoints, it will have negotiated different keys
      with each of them, and all of that traffic is coming to the same
      transport address on the endpoint.  Thus, we need a way to
      describe the different keys we're using to/from different
      transport addresses.  One solution is to indicate the remote
      transport address.  Indicating the remote SSRC is insufficient for
      this task, as several SRTP keying mechanisms do not include SSRC
      in their signaling (DTLS-SRTP, ZRTP, Security Descriptions).

      For example, if there were two remote peers with different keys,
      we could signal it like this:

       a=crypto:1 AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_32
         inline:NzB4d1BINUAvLEw6UzF3WSJ+PSdFcGdUJShpX1Zj|2^20|1:32

         inline:AmO4q1OVAHNiYRj6HmS3JFWNCFqSpTqHWKKIN1Mw|2^20|1:32
         192.0.2.1:5678 SSRC=3289 SSRC=2813

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  Incorrect ESC

   Insertion of the incorrect public key of the SRTP ESC will result in
   disclosure of the SRTP session key to an unauthorized party.  Thus,
   the UA's configuration MUST be protected to prevent such
   misconfiguration.  If the configuration or the ESC's certificate are
   obtained over the network [I-D.ietf-sipping-config-framework],
   [I-D.ietf-sip-certs], the certificate MUST be suitably authenticated
   and integrity protected.

Internet-Draft             SRTP Event Package              February 2007


5.2.  Risks of Sharing SRTP Session Key

   A party authorized to obtain the SRTP session key can listen to the
   media stream and could inject data into the media stream as if it
   were either party.  The alternatives are worse:  disclose the
   device's private key to the transcoder or media recording device, or
   abandon using secure SRTP key exchange in environments that require
   media transcoding or media recording.  As we wish to promote the use
   of secure SRTP key exchange mechanisms, disclosure of the SRTP
   session key appears the least of these evils.

5.3.  Disclosure Flag

   Secure SRTP key exchange techniques which implement this
   specification SHOULD provide a "disclosure flag", similar to that
   first proposed in Appendix B of [I-D.zimmermann-avt-zrtp].

5.4.  Integrity and encryption of keying information

   The mechanism describe in this specification relies on protecting and
   encrypting the keying information.  There are well known mechanism to
   achieve that goal.

   Using SIPS to convey the SRTP key exposes the SRTP master key to all
   SIP proxies between the Event Publication Agent (ESC, the SIP User
   Agent) and the Event State Compositor (ESC).  S/MIME allows
   disclosing the SRTP master key to only the ESC.


6.  IANA Considerations

   New SSRC extension of the "crypto" attribute, and the new "rcrypto"
   attribute will be registered here.
