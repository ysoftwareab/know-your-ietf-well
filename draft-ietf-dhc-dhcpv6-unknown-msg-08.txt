Abstract

   DHCPv6 is not specific about handling messages with unknown types.
   This memo describes the problems and defines how a DHCPv6 server,
   client or relay agent should behave when receiving unknown DHCPv6
   messages.  This document also provides advice for authors of future
   documents defining new messages sent from DHCP servers to DHCP relay
   agents, and should be read by potential authors of such documents.
   This document updates RFC3315.

1.  Introduction

   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] provides a framework for conveying IPv6
   configuration information to hosts on a TCP/IP network.  But
   [RFC3315] is not specific about how to deal with messages with
   unrecognized types.  This document describes the problems and defines
   the behavior of a DHCPv6 server, client or relay agent when handling
   unknown DHCPv6 messages.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Problem Statement

   When a relay agent receives a message, it decides to send the message
   either toward the server or toward the client.  It decides on the
   direction to forward based on the message type.  Since RFC3315 was
   published new message types have been defined.  More such messages
   may be defined in the future.  RFC3315 does not specify the what to
   do when a DHCP agent does not recognize the type of message it has
   received.  This may lead to relay agents inappropriately dropping
   such messages, and to other DHCP agents inappropriately processing
   such messages.

   In addition, there is no specific requirement for dealing with
   unknown messages by the client or server in RFC3315.

   Note it is expected that most future DHCPv6 messages will not be used
   to communicate directly with relay agents (though they may need to be
   relayed by relay agents).

4.  Relay Agent Behavior Update

   Relay agents relay messages toward servers and clients according to
   the message type.  The Relay-reply message is sent toward the client.
   The Relay-forward message and other types of messages are sent toward
   the server.

   We say "toward the client" and "toward the server" because relay
   agents may be chained together, so a relay message may be sent
   through multiple relay agents along the path to its destination.
   Relay-reply messages specify a destination address; the relay agent
   extracts the encapsulated message and sends it to the specified
   destination address.  Any message other than a Relay-reply does not
   have such a specified destination, so it follows the default
   forwarding path configured on the relay agent, which is always toward
   the server.

   The sole purpose of requiring relay agents to relay unknown messages
   is to ensure that when legitimate new messages are defined in the
   protocol, relay agents, even if they were manufactured prior to the
   definition of these new messages, will, by default, succeed in
   relaying such messages.

4.1.  A Valid Message for Constructing a New Relay-forward Message

   Section 20.1 of [RFC3315] states that:

     "When a relay agent receives a valid message to be relayed, it
     constructs a new Relay-forward message."

   It does not define which types of messages are valid for constructing
   Relay-Forward messages.  In this document, we specify the definition
   as follows.

     The message is valid for constructing a new Relay-forward message:

     (a) if the message is a Relay-forward message, or

     (b) if the relay agent recognizes the message type and is not the
     intended target, or

     (c) if the relay agent does not recognize the message type.

   New DHCP message types may be defined in future that are sent,
   unsolicited, to relay agents.  Relay agents that do not implement
   these messages will not recognize such messages as being intended for
   them.  A relay agent that implements this specification will
   therefore forward such messages to the DHCP servers to which it is
   configured to relay client messages.

   At this time, no such message types have been specified.  If such a
   message is specified in the future, it is possible that this would
   result in needless load on DHCP servers.  If such a message type is
   defined in a future specification, authors may need to consider some
   strategy for identifying non-conforming relays and not sending such
   messages to them.

   However, since DHCP servers do not respond to unknown messages, this
   is unlikely to create significant load, and therefore is likely to be
   unnecessary.

4.2.  Relaying a Message toward Server

   If the relay agent receives a Relay-forward message, Section 20.1.2
   of [RFC3315] defines the required behavior.  If the relay agent
   receives messages other than Relay-forward and Relay-reply and the
   relay agent does not recognize its message type, it MUST forward them
   as is described in Section 20.1.1 of [RFC3315].

4.3.  Relaying a Message toward Client

   If the relay agent receives a Relay-reply message, it MUST process
   the message as is defined in Section 20.2 of [RFC3315], regardless of
   the type of the message encapsulated in the Relay Message Option.

5.  Client and Server Behavior Update

   A client or server MUST silently discard any received DHCPv6 message
   with an unknown message type.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document creates no new security issues that are not already
   present in RFC3315.  By explicitly documenting the correct handling
   of unknown messages, this document, if implemented, reduces any
   security exposure that might result from incorrect handling of
   unknown messages.  The following issues are issues that could already
   be present with section 23 of [RFC3315], but we discuss them in
   detail here as guidance for implementors.

   As the relay agent will forward all unknown types of DHCPv6 messages,
   a malicious attacker can interfere with the relaying function by
   constructing fake DHCPv6 messages with arbitrary type code.  The same
   problem may happen in current DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 practice where the
   attacker constructs the fake DHCP message with a known type code.

   Clients and servers that implement this specification will discard
   unknown DHCPv6 messages.  Since RFC3315 did not specify either relay
   agent, client or server behavior in the presence of unknown messages,
   it is possible that some servers or clients that have not been
   updated to conform to this specification might be made vulnerable to
   client attacks through the relay agent.

   For this reason, we recommend that relay agents, clients and servers
   be updated to follow this new specification.  However, in most
   deployment scenarios, it will be much easier to attack clients
   directly than through a relay agent; furthermore, attacks using
   unknown message types are already possible on the local wire.

   So in most cases, if clients are not upgraded there should be minimal
   additional risk; at sites where only servers and relay agents can be
   upgraded, the incremental benefit of doing so most likely exceeds any
   risk due to vulnerable clients.

   Nothing in this update should be construed to mean that relay agents
   may not be administratively configurable to drop messages on the
   basis of the message type, for security reasons (e.g., in a
   firewall).
