ABSTRACT
   This document describes the terminology for benchmarking Interior 
   Gateway Protocol (IGP) Route Convergence.   The terminology is to 
   be used for benchmarking IGP convergence time through externally 
   observable (black box) data plane measurements.  The terminology 
   can be applied to any link-state IGP, such as ISIS and OSPF.

INTERNET-DRAFT           Benchmarking Terminology for     March 2009
                 Link-State IGP Data Plane Route Convergence

1. Introduction and Scope

   This draft describes the terminology for benchmarking Interior 
   Gateway Protocol (IGP) Route Convergence.  The motivation and 
   applicability for this benchmarking is provided in [Po07a].  The 
   methodology to be used for this benchmarking is described in [Po07m].  
   The purpose of this document is to introduce new terms required to 
   complete execution of the IGP Route Convergence Methodology [Po07m].  
   These terms apply to IPv4 and IPv6 traffic and IGPs.

   Convergence times are measured at the Tester on the data plane by 
   observing packet loss through the DUT.  The methodology and 
   terminology to be used for benchmarking Route Convergence can be 
   applied to any link-state IGP such as ISIS [Ca90] and OSPF [Mo98].  
   The data plane is measured to obtain black-box (externally 
   observable) convergence benchmarking metrics.  When there is no
   packer loss observed in the data plane, the convergence time
   SHALL be reported as zero.  

   An example of Route Convergence as observed and measured from the 
   data plane is shown in Figure 1.  The graph in Figure 1 shows 
   Forwarding Rate versus Time.  Time 0 on the X-axis is on the far 
   right of the graph.  The Offered Load to the ingress interface of 
   the DUT SHOULD equal the measured Throughput [Ba99][Ma98] of the DUT 
   and the Forwarding Rate [Ma98] and Convergence Packet Loss is 
   measured at the Preferred and Next-Best Egress interfaces of the DUT
   befire, during, and after a Convergence Event Trigger.  These 
   components of the graph are defined in the Term Definitions section.

2.  Existing Definitions
   This document uses existing terminology defined in other BMWG 
   work.  Examples include, but are not limited to: 
      
             Latency                   [Ref.[Ba91], section 3.8] 
             Frame Loss Rate           [Ref.[Ba91], section 3.6] 
             Throughput                [Ref.[Ba91], section 3.17] 
             Device Under Test (DUT)   [Ref.[Ma98], section 3.1.1] 
             System Under Test (SUT)   [Ref.[Ma98], section 3.1.2] 
             Out-of-order Packet       [Ref.[Po06], section 3.3.2] 
             Duplicate Packet          [Ref.[Po06], section 3.3.3] 
             Packet Reordering         [Ref.[Mo06], section 3.3]

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 
   [Br97].  RFC 2119 defines the use of these key words to help make the
   intent of standards track documents as clear as possible.  While this
   document uses these keywords, this document is not a standards track
   document.

3. Term Definitions

 3.1 States
   3.1.1 Route Convergence

        Definition:
        The action to update all components of the router with the 
        most recent route change(s) including the Routing 
        Information Base (RIB) and Forwarding Information Base (FIB), 
        along with software and hardware tables, such that forwarding 
        is successful for one or more route entries.

        Discussion:
        Route Convergence MUST occur after a Convergence Event.
        Route Convergence can be observed externally by the rerouting
        of data traffic to the Next-best Egress Interface.  Also,
        completion of Route Convergence may or may not be sustained 
        over time.

        Measurement Units: N/A

INTERNET-DRAFT           Benchmarking Terminology for     March 2009
                 Link-State IGP Data Plane Route Convergence

   3.1.2 Full Convergence

        Definition:
        Route Convergence for an entire FIB in which complete recovery 
        from the Convergence Event is indicated by the DUT throughput 
        equal to the offered load.

        Discussion:
        When benchmarking convergence, it is useful to measure
        the time to converge an entire FIB.  For example,
        a Convergence Event can be produced for an OSPF table of 
        5000 routes so that the time to converge routes 1 through 
        5000 is measured.  Completion of Full Convergence is externally 
        observable from the data plane when the Throughput of the data 
        plane traffic on the Next-Best Egress Interface equals the 
        offered load.  

        Full Convergence MAY be measured using Rate-Derived Convergence 
        Method or calculated using Loss-Derived Convergence Method. 
        Full Convergence may or may not be sustained over time.  The 
        Sustained Convergence Validation Time MUST be applied.

   3.1.3 Network Convergence  

        Definition:
        The process of updating of all routing tables, including 
        distributed FIBs, in all routers throughout the network.

        Discussion:
        Network Convergence requires completion of all Route 
        Convergence operations for all routers in the network following 
        a Convergence Event.  Completion of Network Convergence can be 
        observed by recovery of System Under Test (SUT) Throughput to 
        equal the offered load, with no Stale Forwarding, and no 
        Blenders [Ca01][Ci03].

        Measurement Units: N/A

        Issues: None

        Route Convergence
        Stale Forwarding
 
  3.1.4 Route-Specific Convergence
        Definition:
        Route Convergence for one or more specific route entries in 
        the FIB in which recovery from the Convergence Event is 
        indicated when data-plane traffic for the flow [Po06] matching 
        that route entry(ies) is routed to the Next-Best Egress 
        Interface.

        Discussion:
        When benchmarking convergence, it is sometimes useful to 
        measure the time to converge a single flow [Po06] or group of 
        flows to benchmark convergence time for one or a few route 
        entries in the FIB instead of the entire FIB.  Route-Specific 
        Convergence of a flow is externally observable from the data 
        plane when the data plane traffic for that flow is routed to 
        the Next-Best Egress Interface.

   3.1.5 Stale Forwarding
        Definition:
        Forwarding of traffic to route entries that no longer exist 
        or to route entries with next-hops that are no longer preferred.

        Discussion:
        Stale Forwarding can be caused by a Convergence Event and can 
        manifest as a "black-hole" or microloop that produces packet 
        loss.  Stale Forwarding can exist until Network Convergence is 
        completed.  Stale Forwarding cannot be observed with a single 
        DUT.

 3.2 Events

   3.2.1 Convergence Event
        
        Definition:
        The occurrence of a planned or unplanned event in the network 
        that results in a change in the egress interface of the Device
        Under Test (DUT) for routed packets.

        Discussion:
        Convergence Events include link loss, routing protocol session 
        loss, router failure, configuration change, and better next-hop
        learned via a routing protocol.

   3.2.2 Convergence Event Trigger
    
        Definition:
        An action taken by the Tester to produce a Convergence Event.

        Discussion:
        The Convergence Event Trigger is introduced by the Tester and 
        may be indicated by link loss, routing protocol session loss, 
        router failure, configuration change, or a better next-hop 
        learned via a routing protocol introduced by the Tester.

   3.2.3 Convergence Event Instant

        Definition:
        The time instant that a Convergence Event becomes observable in 
        the data plane.

        Discussion:
        Convergence Event Instant is observable from the data 
        plane as the precise time that the device under test begins 
        to exhibit packet loss.  The Convergence Event Instant is
        produced by the Convergence Event Trigger.  The Convergence 
        Event Instant always occurs concurrent or subsequent to the 
        Tester introducing the Convergence Event Trigger.

        Measurement Units:

   3.2.4 Convergence Recovery Instant

        Definition:
        The time instant that Full Convergence completion is 
        observed.

        Discussion:
        Convergence Recovery Instant is measurable from the data 
        plane as the precise time that the device under test completes 
        Full Convergence.  The Convergence Recovery Instant MUST be 
        maintained for an interval of duration equal to the Sustained 
        Convergence Validation Time.

        Measurement Units:
        hh:mm:ss:nnn:uuu, 
           where 'nnn' is milliseconds and 'uuu' is microseconds.

   3.2.5 First Route Convergence Instant
        Definition:
        The time instant a first route entry has converged 
        following a Convergence Event, as observed by receipt of 
        the first packet from the Next-Best Egress Interface.

        Discussion:
        The First Route Convergence Instant is an indication that the 
        process to achieve Full Convergence has begun.  Any route may 
        be the first to converge for First Route Convergence Instant.  
        Measurement on the data-plane enables the First Route 
        Convergence Instant to be observed without any white-box 
        information from the DUT.  

        Measurement Units:
           hh:mm:ss:nnn:uuu, 
             where 'nnn' is milliseconds and 'uuu' is microseconds.

   3.2.6 Convergence Event Transition
        Definition:
        A time interval observed following a Convergence Event in which
        Throughput gradually reduces to a minimum value.

        Discussion:
        The Convergence Event Transition is best observed for Full 
        Convergence.  The egress packet rate observed during a 
        Convergence Event Transition may not decrease linearly and may 
        not decrease to zero.  Both the offered load and the Packet 
        Sampling Interval influence the observations of the Convergence 
        Event Transition.  For example, it is possible that if the 
        Convergence Event were to cause the Throughput [Ba91] to drop 
        to zero then this may not be observed if the Packet Sampling 
        Interval is set too high.  This is further discussed with the 
        term "Packet Sampling Interval".

   3.2.7 Convergence Recovery Transition

        Definition:
        The characteristic of the DUT in which Throughput gradually 
        increases to equal the offered load.

        Discussion:
        The Convergence Recovery Transition is best observed for 
        Full Convergence.  The egress packet rate observed during
        a Convergence Recovery Transition may not increase linearly.
        Both the offered load and the Packet Sampling Interval
        influence the observations of the Convergence Recovery
        Transition.  This is further discussed with the term 
        "Packet Sampling Interval".

   3.2.8 Nested Convergence Events

        Definition:
        The occurrence of a Convergence Event while the route 
        table is converging from a prior Convergence Event.  

        Discussion:
        The Convergence Events for a Nested Convergence Event
        MUST occur with different neighbors.  A common 
        observation from a Nested Convergence Event will be 
        the withdrawal of routes from one neighbor while the

 3.4 Benchmarking Methods

   3.4.1  Packet Loss

        Definition:
        The number of packets that should have been forwarded
        by a DUT under a constant offered load that were 
        not forwarded due to lack of resources.

        Discussion:
        Packet Loss is a modified version of the term "Frame Loss Rate" 
        as defined in [Ba91].  The term "Frame Loss" is intended for 
        Ethernet Frames while "Packet Loss" is intended for IP packets.  
        Packet Loss can be measured as a reduction in forwarded traffic 
        from the Throughput [Ba91] of the DUT. 

        Measurement units:
        Number of offered packets that are not forwarded. 

        Issues:  None

        See Also:
        Convergence Packet Loss

   3.4.2 Convergence Packet Loss

        Definition:
        The number of packets lost due to a Convergence Event
        until Full Convergence completes.

        Discussion:
        Convergence Packet Loss includes packets that were lost and 
        packets that were delayed due to buffering.  The Convergence 
        Packet Loss observed in a Packet Sampling Interval may or may 
        not be equal to the number of packets in the offered load 
        during the interval following a Convergence Event (see Figure 
        1).

   3.4.3 Rate-Derived Convergence Method
        Definition:
        The method to calculate convergence time benchmarks from the 
        amount of time that Convergence Packet Loss persists upon 
        occurrence of a Convergence Event.    

        Rate-Derived Convergence Method can be calculated as the time 
        difference from the Convergence Event Instant to the 
        Convergence Recovery Instant, as shown with Equation 1.
        
        (Equation 1)  
          Rate-Derived Convergence Method = 
              Convergence Recovery Instant - Convergence Event Instant. 
              
        Discussion:
        It is RECOMMENDED that the Rate-Derived Convergence Method be 
        measured when benchmarking convergence times.  The Rate-Derived 
        Convergence Method SHOULD be measured with an Offered Load at 
        the Throughput of the DUT.  At least one packet per route 
        in the FIB for all routes in the FIB MUST be offered to the DUT 
        within the Packet Sampling Interval.  
        
        It is possible to measure no packet loss, which results in a
        Rate-Derived Convergence Time benchmark of zero.  Failure to 
        achieve Full Convergence results in a Rate-Derived Convergence 
        Time benchmark of infinity.

   3.4.4 Loss-Derived Convergence Method
        Definition:
        The method to calculate convergence time benchmarks from the 
        amount of Convergence Packet Loss.  Loss-Derived Convergence 
        Method can be calculated from Convergence Packet Loss as shown 
        with Equation 2.  

        Equation 2 - 
          Loss-Derived Convergence Method =
                Convergence Packets Loss / Offered Load
          where units are packets / packets/second = seconds

INTERNET-DRAFT             Benchmarking Terminology for   March 2009
                 Link-State IGP Data Plane Route Convergence

        Discussion:
        Ideally, the Convergence Event Transition and Convergence 
        Recovery Transition are instantaneous so that the Rate-Derived 
        Convergence Method = Loss-Derived Convergence Method.  However, 
        router implementations are less than ideal.  Loss-Derived 
        Convergence Method gives a better than actual result when 
        converging many routes simultaneously because it ignores the 
        transitions.  The Rate-Derived Convergence Method takes the 
        transitions into account.  

        Equation 2 calculates the average convergence time over all 
        routes to which packets have been sent. The average convergence 
        time is often lower than the maximum convergence time 
        over all routes, so it can produce a result that is faster than 
        the actual convergence time..  Therefore, Loss-Derived 
        Convergence Method is not the preferred method to measure 
        convergence benchmarks.  For these reasons the RECOMMENDED 
        method to obtain a benchmark metric for convergence time is the 
        Rate-Derived Convergence Method.

   3.4.5 Packet Sampling Interval
        Definition:  
        The interval at which the tester (test equipment) polls to make 
        measurements for arriving packet flows.

        Discussion: 
        At least one packet per route in the FIB for all routes in the 
        FIB MUST be offered to the DUT within the Packet Sampling 
        Interval.  Metrics measured at the Packet Sampling Interval 
        MUST include Forwarding Rate and Convergence Packet Loss.

        Packet Sampling Interval can influence the Convergence Graph.
        This is particularly true when implementations complete Full 
        Convergence in less time than the Packet Sampling Interval.  The 
        Convergence Event Transition and Convergence Recovery Transition

        can become exaggerated when the Packet Sampling Interval is too 
        long.  In this condition, the Rate-Derived Convergence Method 
        may produce a larger than actual convergence time.  In such 
        cases the Loss-Derived Convergence Method may produce a more 
        accurate result.  The recommended value for configuration of 
        the Packet Sampling Interval is provided in [Po07m].

3.5 Benchmarks

   3.5.1 Full Convergence Time

        Definition:
        The amount of time it takes for Full Convergence to occur.

        Discussion:
        Full Convergence Time can be determined using the Rate-Derived             
        Convergence Method or Loss-Derived Convergence Method.  The 
        Rate-Derived Convergence Method is RECOMMENDED.  When 
        measuring Route-Specific Convergence Time, there may be 
        conditions in which the maximum Route Specific Convergence Time
        can be reported as the Full Convergence Time.  Full Convergence 
        may or may not be sustained over time.  The Sustained 
        Convergence Validation Time MUST be applied.

   3.5.2 First Route Convergence Time

        Definition:
        The amount of time for Convergence Packet Loss until the 
        convergence of a first route entry on the Next-Best Egress 
        Interface, as indicated by the First Route Convergence 
        Instant.

INTERNET-DRAFT             Benchmarking Terminology for   March 2009
                 Link-State IGP Data Plane Route Convergence

        Discussion:
        The First Route Convergence Time benchmarking metric can be 
        measured when benchmarking either Full Convergence or 
        Route-Specific Convergence.  When benchmarking Full Convergence, 
        First Route Convergence Time can be measured as the time 
        difference from the Convergence Event Instant and the First 
        Route Convergence Instant, as shown with Equation 4a.
        
        (Equation 4a)  
        First Route Convergence Time = 
        First Route Convergence Instant - Convergence Event Instant 
         
        First Route Convergence Time should be measured at the maximum
        Throughput of the DUT.  At least one packet per route in the FIB 
        for all routes in the FIB MUST be offered to the DUT within the
        Packet Sampling Interval.  Failure to achieve the First Route 
        Convergence Instant results in a First Route Convergence Time 
        benchmark of infinity.

   3.5.3 Route-Specific Convergence Time

        Definition:
        The amount of time it takes for Route-Specific Convergence to
        be completed as calculated from the amount of Convergence 
        Packet Loss for the flow associated to a specific route.

        Route-Specific Convergence Time can be calculated from
        Convergence Packet Loss as shown with Equation 3.

        (Equation 3) Route-Specific Convergence Time =
                           Convergence Packets Loss / Offered Load
          where units are packets / packets/second = seconds

                 Link-State IGP Data Plane Route Convergence
     
        Discussion:
        It is possible to provide an offered load that has flows 
        matching every route entry in the FIB and benchmarking 
        Route-Specific Convergence Time for all route entries.  The 
        number of flows that can be measured is dependent upon the flow 
        measurement capabilities of the Tester.  When benchmarking 
        Route-Specific Convergence, Convergence Packet Loss is measured 
        for specific flow(s) and Equation 3 is applied for each flow.  
        Each flow has a single destination address matching a different 
        route entry.  The fastest measurable convergence time is equal 
        to the time between two consecutive packets of a flow offered
        by the Tester.  In practice, the fastest measurable 
        convergence time is the Packet Sampling Interval of the Tester. 

        The Route-Specific Convergence Time benchmarks enable minimum, 
        maximum, average, and median convergence time measurements to be 
        reported by comparing the results for the different route 
        entries.  It also enables benchmarking of convergence time when 
        configuring a priority value for route entry(ies).  Since 
        multiple Route-Specific Convergence Times can be measured it is 
        possible to have an array of results.  The format for reporting 
        Route-Specific Convergence Time is provided in [Po07m].

   3.5.4 Sustained Convergence Validation Time
        Definition:
        The amount of time for which the completion of Full 
        Convergence is maintained without additional packet loss.  

        Discussion:
        The purpose of the Sustained Convergence Validation Time is to 
        produce Convergence benchmarks protected against fluctuation 
        in Throughput after the completion of Full Convergence is 
        observed.  The RECOMMENDED Sustained Convergence Validation 
        Time to be used is 5 seconds.  The BMWG selected 5 seconds 
        based upon RFC 2544 [Ba99] which recommends waiting 2 seconds 
        for residual frames to arrive and 5 seconds for DUT 
        restabilization.

   3.5.5 Reversion Convergence Time

        Definition:
        The amount of time for the DUT to complete Full Convergence 
        to the Preferred Egress Interface, instead of the Next-Best 
        Egress Interface, upon recovery from a Convergence Event.

        Discussion:
        Reversion Convergence Time is the amount of time for Full
        Convergence to the original egress interface.  This is 
        achieved by recovering from the Convergence Event, such as 
        restoring the failed link.  Reversion Convergence Time 
        can be measured using the Rate-Derived Convergence Method 
        or Loss-Derived Convergence Method.  The Rate-Derived 
        Convergence Method is RECOMMENDED.  It is possible to have 
        the Reversion Convergence Time differ from the Full 
        Convergence Time.

4. IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA considerations.

5. Security Considerations

   Documents of this type do not directly affect the security of
   Internet or corporate networks as long as benchmarking is not
   performed on devices or systems connected to production networks.
   Security threats and how to counter these in SIP and the media 
   layer is discussed in RFC3261, RFC3550, and RFC3711 and various 
   other drafts.  This document attempts to formalize a set of 
   common terminology for benchmarking IGP convergence performance 
   in a lab environment.
