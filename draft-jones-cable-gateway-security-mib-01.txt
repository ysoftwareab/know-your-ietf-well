Internet-Draft      CableHome Gateway Security MIB        January 2003 
 
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the 
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB 
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, 
   RFC 2578 [7], STD 58, RFC 2579 [8] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [9]. 
    
    
2. Glossary 
    
   The terms in this document are derived either from normal cable 
   system usage, from normal residential gateway operation, or from the 
   documents associated with the CableHome Specifications [21]. 
       
2.1 CableHome Residential Gateway 
    
   A CableHome Residential gateway passes data traffic between the cable 
   operator's broadband data network (the Wide Area Network, WAN) and 
   the Local Area Network (LAN) in the cable data service subscriber's 
   residence or business. In addition to passing traffic between the WAN 
   and LAN, the CableHome Residential Gateway provides several services 
   including a DHCP client and a DHCP server (RFC2131) [22], a TFTP 
   server (RFC1350) [23], management services as enabled by 
   SNMPv1/v2c/v3 agent compliant with the RFCs listed in Section 1, and 
   security services including stateful packet inspection firewall 
   functionality and software code image verification using techniques. 
            
2.2 Portal Services 
    
   A logical element aggregating the set of CableHome-specified 
   functionality in a CableHome compliant cable gateway device. 
    
    
2.3 LAN IP Device  
        
   A LAN IP Device is representative of a typical IP device expected to 
   reside on home networks, and is assumed to contain a TCP/IP stack as 
   well as a DHCP client. 
    
2.4 WAN Management (WAN-Man) Address  
        
   WAN Management Addresses are intended for network management traffic 
   on the cable network between the network management system and the PS 
   element. Typically, these addresses will reside in private IP address 
   space.  
        
2.5 WAN Data (WAN-Data) Address  
        
   WAN Data Addresses are intended for subscriber application traffic on 
   the cable network and beyond, such as traffic between LAN IP Devices 
   and Internet hosts. Typically, these addresses will reside in public 
   IP address space.

Internet-Draft      CableHome Gateway Security MIB        January 2003 
 
        
2.6 LAN Translated (LAN-Trans) Address  
        
   LAN Translated Addresses are intended for subscriber application and 
   management traffic on the home network between LAN IP Devices and the 
   PS element. Typically, these addresses will reside in private IP 
   address space, and can typically be reused across subscribers. 
    
2.7 LAN Passthrough (LAN-Pass) Address  
     
   LAN Passthrough Addresses are intended for subscriber application 
   traffic, such as traffic between LAN IP Devices and Internet hosts, 
   on the home network, the cable network, and beyond. Typically, these 
   addresses will reside in public IP address space.  
        
2.8 Cable Gateway DHCP Portal (CDP) 
 
   A logical element residing within the PS that encapsulates DHCP 
   functionality within a Cable Gateway Device. This includes both DHCP 
   client as well as DHCP server capabilities. 
    
2.9 Denial of Service 
 
   A type of attack on a network that is designed to bring the network 
   to its knees by flooding it with useless traffic. 
 
2.10 Firewall 
 
   A system designed to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private 
   network.  Firewalls are frequently used to prevent unauthorized 
   Internet users from accessing private networks connected to the 
   Internet. 
 
2.11 Hash 
 
   A hash value (or simply hash) is a number generated from a string of 
   text. The hash is substantially smaller than the text itself, and is 
   generated by a formula in such a way that it is extremely unlikely 
   that some other text will produce the same hash value. Hashes play a 
   role in security systems where they're used to ensure that 
   transmitted messages have not been tampered with. 
 
2.12 Rule Set 
 
   The rule set is derived from the security policy and defines the 
   collection of access control rules (filter and proxy action rules) 
   which then determines which packets the firewall forwards and which 
   it rejects.

2.13 Security Policy 
 
   The security policy defines the desired level of 
   security/functionality for a subscriber's firewall. 
    
    
3. Overview 
 
   This MIB provides a set of security objects required for the 
   management of CableHome compliant residential gateway devices.  The 
   specification is derived from the CableHome 1.0 specification [21]. 
    
3.1 Structure of the MIB 
    
   This MIB is structured into two groups: 
     
  û cabhSecFwObjects is used to manage the firewall functionality. 
   
  û cabhSecCertObjects is used to hold the gateway device certificate, 
     which is used to authenticate the gateway. 
 
    
3.2 Management Requirements  
 
3.1.1.  Firewall Enable 
 
The cabhSecFwPolicyFileEnable object enables or disables firewall rule 
set filtering functions. 
 
3.1.2.  Firewall Configuration File Download 
 
   The firewall configuration file download process is documented in 
   [21].  From a network management station, the operator: 
 
  û sets cabhSecFwPolicyFileHash to the hash value calculated using the 
     firewall configuration file. 
   
  û sets cabhSecFwPolicyFileURL to the name and IP address of the 
     firewall configuratrion file using TFTP URL format.  When this 
     value changes, it triggers the file download. 
 
   Download status and the version of the firewall configuration file 
   can be obtained from the cabhSecFwPolicyFileOperStatus and 
   cabhSecFwPolicyCurrentVersion MIB objects. 
    
3.1.3  Firewall Event Management 
 
   There are three types of firewall events that can be logged.  The 
   following objects allow the operator to enable or disable the logging 
   of these events:

Internet-Draft      CableHome Gateway Security MIB        January 2003 
 
 
  û cabhSecFwEventType1Enable controls the logging of Type 1 event 
     messages which indicate attempts from both private and public 
     clients to traverse the firewall that violate the security policy. 
   
  û cabhSecFwEventType2Enable controls the logging of Type 2 event 
     messages which indicate the detection of Denial-of-Service attacks. 
   
  û cabhSecFwEventType3Enable controls the logging of Type 3 event 
     messages which indicate changes in firewall management parameters. 
 
   Event messaging details are documented in [21]. 
 
3.1.4  Firewall Attack Alert 
 
   The Firewall Attack Alert MIB objects enable an MSO to be notified 
   when a firewall as been attacked a certain number of times within a 
   given period. 
 
   The cabhSecFwEventAttackAlertThreshold object is set with the number 
   of Type 1 or Type 2 hacker attacks that are allowed within the time 
   period attacks exceed this number an event message MUST be logged. 
    
   The cabhSecFwEventAttackAlertPeriod object indicates the period to be 
   used (in hours) for the  cabhSecFwEventAttackAlertThreshold. This MIB 
   object should always keep track of the last  x hours of event meaning 
   that if the variable is set to track events for 10 hours then when 
   the 11th hour is reached, the 1st hour of events is deleted from the 
   tracking log. A default value is set to zero, meaning zero time, so 
   that this MIB variable will not track any events unless configured. 
         
3.1.5  PS Certificate 
 
   The cabhSecCertPsCert provides the ability to read the certificate 
   information in a compliant CableHome residential gateway device. The 
   PS certicate is used to in the process to authenticate the device.

5. Formal Syntax 
    
    
   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur 
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC-2234 [3]. 
    
    
6. Security Considerations 
    
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that 
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such 
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
   network operations. 
    
   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and 
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending 
   them over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide 
   features for such a secure environment. 
    
   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.  
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),

Internet-Draft      CableHome Gateway Security MIB        January 2003 
 
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is 
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects 
   in this MIB module. 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as 
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), 
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for 
   authentication and privacy). 
    
   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
   RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
   instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access to 
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate 
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
