                  YANG Data Model for Segment Routing
                      draft-ietf-spring-sr-yang-30

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG data model for segment routing
   configuration and operation, which is to be augmented by different
   segment routing data planes.  The document also defines a YANG model
   that is intended to be used on network elements to configure or
   operate the segment routing MPLS data plane, as well as some generic
   containers to be reused by IGP protocol modules to support segment
   routing.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG data model [RFC7950] for segment routing
   [RFC8402] configuration and operation.  The document also defines a
   YANG model that is intended to be used on network elements to
   configure or operate the segment routing MPLS data plane [RFC8660].
   This document does not define the IGP extensions to support segment
   routing but defines generic groupings to be reused by IGP extension

   modules.  The reason of this design choice is to not require
   implementations to support all IGP extensions.  For example, an
   implementation may support the IS-IS extension but not the OSPF
   extension.

   The YANG modules in this document conform to the Network Management
   Datastore Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342].

2.  Terminology and Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.1.  Tree diagram

   Tree diagrams used in this document follow the notation defined in
   [RFC8340].

2.2.  Prefixes in Data Node Names

   In this document, names of data nodes, actions, and other data model
   objects are often used without a prefix, as long as it is clear from
   the context in which YANG module each name is defined.  Otherwise,
   names are prefixed using the standard prefix associated with the
   corresponding YANG module, as shown in Table 1.

               +----------+--------------------+-----------+
               | Prefix   | YANG module        | Reference |
               +----------+--------------------+-----------+
               | if       | ietf-interfaces    | [RFC8343] |
               | rt       | ietf-routing       | [RFC8349] |
               | rt-types | ietf-routing-types | [RFC8294] |
               | yang     | ietf-yang-types    | [RFC6991] |
               | inet     | ietf-inet-types    | [RFC6991] |

3.  Design of the Data Model

   Module ietf-segment-routing augments the routing container in the
   ietf-routing model [RFC8349], and defines generic segment routing
   configuration and operational state.  This module is augmented by
   modules supporting different data planes.

4.  Configuration

   The module ietf-segment-routing-mpls augments the "/rt:routing/
   sr:segment-routing:" with an sr-mpls container.  This container
   defines all the configuration parameters related to the segment-
   routing MPLS data plane.

   The sr-mpls configuration is split in global configuration and
   interface configuration.

   The global configuration includes :

   o  bindings : Defines prefix to SID mappings.  The operator can
      control advertisement of Prefix-SID independently for IPv4 and
      IPv6.  Two types of mappings are available:

      *  Mapping-server : maps non local prefixes to a segment ID.
         Configuration of bindings does not automatically allow
         advertisement of those bindings.  Advertisement must be
         controlled by each routing-protocol instance (see Section 5).
         Multiple mapping policies may be defined.

      *  Connected prefixes : maps connected prefixes to a segment ID.
         Advertisement of the mapping will be done by IGP when enabled
         for segment routing (see Section 5).  The SID value can be
         expressed as an index (default), or an absolute value.  The
         "last-hop-behavior" configuration dictates the MPLS PHP
         behavior: "explicit-null", "php", or "non-php".

   o  SRGB (Segment Routing Global Block): Defines a list of label
      blocks represented by a pair of lower-bound/upper-bound labels.
      The SRGB is also agnostic to the control plane used.  So all
      routing-protocol instance will have to advertise the same SRGB.

   o  SRLB (Segment Routing Local Block): Defines a list of label blocks
      represented by a pair of lower-bound/upper-bound labels, reserved
      for local SIDs.

5.  IGP Control plane configuration

   Support of segment-routing extensions for a particular IGP control
   plane is done by augmenting routing-protocol configuration with
   segment-routing extensions.  This augmentation SHOULD be part of
   separate YANG modules in order to not create any dependency for
   implementations to support all protocol extensions.

   This module defines groupings that SHOULD be used by IGP segment
   routing modules.

   The "sr-control-plane" grouping defines the generic global
   configuration for the IGP.

   The "enabled" leaf enables segment-routing extensions for the
   routing-protocol instance.

   The "bindings" container controls the routing-protocol instance's
   advertisement of local bindings and the processing of received
   bindings.

5.1.  IGP interface configuration

   The interface configuration is part of the "igp-interface" grouping
   and includes Adjacency SID properties.

5.1.1.  Adjacency SID properties

5.1.1.1.  Bundling

   In case of parallel IP links between routers, an additional Adjacency
   SID [RFC8402] may be advertised representing more than one adjacency
   (i.e., a bundle of adjacencies).  The "advertise-adj-group-sid"
   configuration controls controls for which group(s) an additional
   adjacency SID is advertised.

   The "advertise-adj-group-sid" is a list of "group-id".  The "group-
   id" will identify interfaces that are bundled together.


           +-------+                 +------+
           |       | ------- L1 ---- |      |
           |   R1  | ------- L2 ---- |  R2  |
           |       | ------- L3 ---- |      |
           |       | ------- L4 ---- |      |
           +-------+                 +------+

   In the figure above, R1 and R2 are interconnected by four links.  A
   routing protocol adjacency is established on each link.  Operator
   would like to create segment-routing Adj-SIDs that represent some
   bundles of links.  We can imagine two different bundles : L1/L2 and
   L3/L4.  To achieve this behavior, the service provider will configure
   a "group-id" X for both interfaces L1 and L2 and a "group-id" Y for
   both interfaces L3 and L4.  This will result in R1 advertising an
   additional an Adj-SID for each adjacency, for example an Adj-SID with
   a value of 400 will be added to L1 and L2.  An Adj-SID and a value of
   500 will be added to L3 and L4.  As L1/L2 and L3/L4 does not share
   the same "group-id", a different SID value will be allocated.

5.1.1.2.  Protection

   The "advertise-protection" defines how protection for an interface is
   advertised.  It does not control the activation or deactivation of
   protection.  If the "single" option is used, a single Adj-SID will be
   advertised for the interface.  If the interface is protected, the
   B-Flag for the Adj-SID advertisement will be set.  If the "dual"
   option is used and if the interface is protected, two Adj-SIDs will
   be advertised for the interface adjacencies.  One Adj-SID will always
   have the B-Flag set and the other will have the B-Flag clear.  This
   option is intended to be used in the case of traffic engineering
   where a path must use either protected segments or non-protected
   segments.

6.  State Data

   The operational states contain information reflecting the usage of
   allocated SRGB labels.

   It also includes a list of all global SIDs, their associated
   bindings, and other information such as the source protocol and
   algorithm.

7.  Notifications

   The model defines the following notifications for segment-routing.

   o  segment-routing-srgb-collision: Raised when a control plane
      advertised SRGB blocks have conflicts.

   o  segment-routing-global-sid-collision: Raised when a control plane
      advertised index is already associated with another target (in
      this version, the only defined targets are IPv4 and IPv6
      prefixes).

   o  segment-routing-index-out-of-range: Raised when a control plane
      advertised index falls outside the range of SRGBs configured for
      the network device.

8.  YANG Modules

   There are three YANG modules included in this document.

9.  Security Considerations

   The YANG modules specified in this document define a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a pre-
   configured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in the modules that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  Writable data nodes represent
   configuration of the router's bindings and the global and local label
   blocks.  These correspond to the following schema nodes:

      /segment-routing

      /segment-routing/mpls

      /segment-routing/mpls/bindings - Modification to the local
      bindings could result in a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.  An
      attacker may also try to create segment conflicts (using the same
      segment identifier for different purposes) to redirect traffic
      within the trusted domain.  However, the traffic will remain
      within the trusted domain.  Redirection could be used to route the
      traffic to compromised nodes within the trusted domain or to avoid
      certain security functions (e.g., firewall).  Refer to section 8.1
      of [RFC8402] for a discussion of the SR-MPLS trusted domain.

      /segment-routing/mpls/srgb - Modification of the Segment Routing
      Global Block (SRGB) could be used to mount a DoS attack.  For
      example, if the SRGB size is reduced to a very small value, a lot
      of existing segments could no longer be installed leading to a
      traffic disruption.

      /segment-routing/mpls/srlb - Modification of the Segment Routing
      Local Block (SRLB) could be used to mount a DoS attacks similar to
      those applicable to the SRGB.

   Some of the readable data nodes in the modules may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  The exposure of either the local
   bindings or SID database would provide an attacker the segment
   routing paths and related topology information.  These correspond to
   the following schema nodes:

      /segment-routing/mpls/bindings - Knowledge of these data nodes can
      be used to attack the local router with a Denial of Service (DoS)
      attack.

      /segment-routing/mpls/sid-db - Knowledge of these data nodes can
      be used to attack the other routers in the segment routing domain
      with either a a Denial of Service (DoS) attack or redirection
      traffic destined for those routers.

   Furthermore exposure the node's capabilities may be useful in
   mounting a Denial-of-Service (DOS) attack by sending the node SR
   packets that the router can't process.  These correspond to the
   following schema nodes:

      /segment-routing/mpls/node-capabilities

      /segment-routing/mpls/msd
