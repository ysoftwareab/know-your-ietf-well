                  SWORN: Secure Wake on Radio Nudging
                      draft-bormann-t2trg-sworn-05

Abstract

   Normally off devices (RFC7228) would need to expend considerable
   energy resources to be reachable at all times.  Instead, MAC layer
   mechanisms are often employed that allow the last hop router of the
   device to "wake" the device via radio when needed.  Activating these
   devices even for a short time still does expend energy and thus
   should be available to authorized correspondents only.
   Traditionally, this has been achieved by heavy firewalling, allowing
   only authorized hosts to reach the device at all.  This may be too
   inflexible for an Internet of Things.

   The present report describes how to use a combination of currently
   standardized technologies to securely effect this authorization.

   We also discuss how the general approach of the original SWORN
   protocol can be extended to cover additional use cases and
   implementation environments.

1.  Introduction

   (See Abstract.)

1.1.  Terminology

   The term "byte" is used in its now customary sense as a synonym for
   "octet".

   Messages defined in this document employ CBOR [RFC8949] and are
   described in CDDL [RFC8610].

   Terms used in this draft:

   C:  Client, or Correspondent host.  The node that wants to effect
      "Wake on Radio" on D by sending a message to D.

   D:  Device.  This is typically battery operated and "Normally off"
      [RFC7228].

   R:  Router.  The router that is adjacent to D, sharing an energy-
      saving link with D, and serving as a ("parent") router to D.

   MAC:  Message Authentication Code (when discussing authentication
      mechanisms)

   MAC:  Media Access Control (when discussing protocol layers)

2.  The original SWORN proposal

2.1.  Assumptions and Requirements

   D is a normally off [RFC7228] device, waking up very briefly to
   communicate with its first hop router R.  R and D share a MAC layer
   that allows R to keep D in extended wake periods.

   R and D have a security association.  (This may have been created in
   network onboarding, or be setup dynamically from the device-to-
   network security association when D chose R as a parent router.)

Internet-Draft     SWORN: Secure Wake on Radio Nudging     February 2022


   D wants to authorize a client (or correspondent host) C to ask R to
   initiate wake periods in D.

   Because of changes in the radio environment, D needs to be able to
   change its parent router from R1 to R2 occasionally.  This should not
   cause a need to notify all its clients; which parent router is used
   by D is therefore opaque to its clients as usual in IP.

2.2.  Security goals

   Since packets with wake tokens are kept in R for extended periods,
   the limited size buffer provided in R for this is a resource that
   needs to be protected to protect availability.

   D uses up battery for a wake period, which would make it susceptible
   to battery depletion attacks.  To protect availability, D should only
   undergo wake periods that R has commanded based on previous
   authorization by D.

   There may be confidentiality requirements (e.g., for privacy); this
   is not addressed in the present version of this report.

Internet-Draft     SWORN: Secure Wake on Radio Nudging     February 2022


2.3.1.  Wake-Grant

   A wake grant is a CWE [RFC8152], packaging a grant key, provided from
   D or D's authorization manager to C.  (Possibly the grant key can be
   conveyed within a larger confidentiality protected data structure or
   channel, such as a CWT [RFC8392] employing a cnf claim for the key
   [RFC8747].)

   A wake grant may then be used by C for initiating (a possibly limited
   number or total duration of) wake periods, employing Wake-Tokens.

   Information about the wake grant is also made available to R, so it
   knows the grant key and the parameters of the wake grant.  (Upon a
   change of parent router, D will need to make that information
   available to its new parent router as well.)

2.3.2.  Wake-Token

   A wake token is a CWS, in a COSE_MAC0 [RFC8152] message built with
   the Wake-Grant's key, containing a CBOR data item of the form:

   [serial: uint, wake-period: duration]

   The CWS is additionally marked by tagging it with a CBOR tag
   1398230866 (a value that becomes visible in a packet dump as ASCII
   "SWOR").

   (Discussion: Should this be a CWE for confidentiality?)

   The serial is used for replay detection, based on the usual window
   mechanism.  Wake-Tokens for a fresh wake grant start out with serial
   numbers at zero.

   A Wake-Token instructs R to use MAC mechanisms to provide an extended
   wake period to D the next time it wakes up.

   The wake token is sent from C to D; R finds it by examining packets
   that it would need to forward to D.

2.3.3.  Finding the wake token

   As C is addressing D with the wake token, R needs to find it in
   traffic purportedly for D.

   As described in [I-D.bormann-intarea-alfi], this cannot be reasonably
   done with IP options (which originally would have carried this kind
   of information in the IP architecture).

Internet-Draft     SWORN: Secure Wake on Radio Nudging     February 2022


   Instead, R finds the wake token by deep packet inspection.  The wake
   token is found by a heuristic that may have false positives; this is
   not a problem as the wake token is then verified by its MAC.

   SWORN requests are carried in UDP packets that also may have a
   payload function.  To this end, they are conveyed as CoAP messages
   [RFC7252].  The wake token is carried in a CoAP option, Wake-Token.
   R can find the option by decoding the CoAP packet in the UDP payload
   or simply by scanning for the 5-byte signature 0xda53574f52 created
   by the CBOR wake token tag.  Any potential wake token so found is
   then validated as a CWS.

   This works well with [RFC8613] as the CoAP security mechanism for any
   payload function that this packet may have.  To be able to use DTLS
   as well, we define a media type "application/dtls-payload" that can
   be used in a CoAP POST request to send a DTLS payload as payload of a
   CoAP message (in other words, the CoAP POST request carries a Wake-
   Token and a Content-Format option).  (Any return packet can be
   similarly sent back in the POST response.)  (TODO: This media type
   has to define the port number juggling needed.)

3.  Generalizing SWORN towards Token-Based In-Network Authorization

   The original SWORN protocol described so far was designed to solve a
   specific use case in a specific implementation environment.

   We can open up the design space in a number of dimensions, which will
   be discussed in the following subsections.

   The general idea of SWORN can be described as:

   *  giving a packet sender a way to send authenticating information
      with the packet,

   *  that is not intended for the recipient of the packet, but instead

   *  to be checked at particular enforcement points on the way,

   *  which are not necessarily known by the sender,

   *  to derive authorization to forward.

   Generalizing the terms used so far, we can identify the following
   players and components:

   *  Packets P that require authorization (more generally, the reliable
      derivation of attributes) by entities on their way,




Bormann & Li             Expires 11 August 2022                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft     SWORN: Secure Wake on Radio Nudging     February 2022


   *  a sender (C) and a recipient (D), where the packets P go from C to
      D,

   *  SWORN policy enforcement points (SPEPs) that are in the network in
      places where the generalized SWORN authorization of and derivation
      of attributes for the packets is performed; the ones that are
      active for a packet P are called R, generalizing the concept of
      the last-hop router R in the SWORN model,

   *  the "grant" G that provides setup information for the SPEP (wake
      grant in SWORN), and

   *  the "token" T that is sent with a specific packet P to carry
      information that will be checked by R/SPEP (wake token in SWORN).

   This model can accommodate additional entities, "authorization
   managers" (AM), that pair with C (CAM) and D (DAM) for purposes of
   creating setup information and potentially distributing it among C
   and D and to network elements that might play the role of R.  The
   distribution may be further facilitated by adding Router AMs (RAM).

   The roles of C and D can also be played by tunnel ingress/egress
   points; this can enable the use of unmodified client and device
   implementations (note that D, if a DAM is used, need not implement
   anything special at all, but can of course benefit from information
   in the token).

3.1.  Position of router R

   The original SWORN protocol is based on a 6LoWPAN-like environment
   where a host (D) has a defined relationship (often including a MAC
   layer security association) to the last-hop router(s) (R) supplying
   it with packets.  This enables D to provide R with information about
   wake grants in a secure way, or to delegate this to its authorization
   manager.

   Within a limited domain [RFC8799], routers that act as SWORN policy
   enforcement points (SPEPs) may be known by configuration.  Security
   associations from D's authorization manager (DAM) to each such PEP
   may be set up already, providing a way for DAM to broadcast policy
   information to all such SPEPs.  This enables policy distribution
   without any involvement from D.

   Alternatively, C can have a security association with the SPEPs
   (possibly indirectly through a client authorization manager CAM) and
   can send special SWORN probe packets towards D that carry grant
   information that the SPEPs on the way can extract and copy into their
   local (soft?) state.

Internet-Draft     SWORN: Secure Wake on Radio Nudging     February 2022


   A SPEP could also react to tokens it does not understand by asking
   authorization managers for the applicable grant; this may be
   facilitated by identifying information in a token such as a "key ID".
   It remains a quality of implementation issue whether the packet can
   be buffered while the relevant grant is obtained.  (On-demand
   retrieval of grants also adds an obvious attack vector.)

3.2.  Position of Token in Packet

   The original SWORN protocol goes to some lengths to avoid the need
   for C to influence properties below the application layer of the
   packets it sends.

   However, routers may be able to provide more efficient
   implementations of SWORN when the token information is in a header.
   So if C has a platform API that could create/influence such a header,
   this could be used instead.

   While penultimate hop processing is in use in a number of
   architectures (see, e.g., Section 3.16 of [RFC3031] or
   [I-D.ietf-bier-php]), it is not currently part of the IPv6
   architecture, so there is no obvious IPv6 header that could carry
   this information.

3.3.  Range of Checking

   Tokens in the original SWORN protocol only check a serial number;
   attackers might be able to extract such a token from a packet,
   suppress the packet, and use the token in a different packet.  We
   call this form of attack "malicious reuse".  Replay protection cannot
   prevent this.

   One way to reduce this attack vector is to make the grant very
   specific to only a certain kind of packets, for instance by
   effectively including an ACL (carrying, say, elements of the 5-tuple)
   with the grant.  (The grant could also include quantitative aspects,
   such as a rate limit.)  The cryptographic makeup of the grant then
   must be such that a client cannot modify the ACL during generation of
   a token from the grant.

   Alternatively, some kinds of malicious reuse can be made harder to
   perform by including more information in the signing input of the MAC
   checked for a token.  If a wake grant is shared between multiple
   instances of D and C and therefore can only have a weak ACL,
   including the source and destination addresses (IP address and
   possibly port) in the signing input for a specific token T prevents
   reuse of T for a different D/C pair.

Internet-Draft     SWORN: Secure Wake on Radio Nudging     February 2022


   Including the payload in the signing input (i.e., essentially
   authenticating the entire packet) makes malicious reuse of tokens
   less useful for an attacker as no new information can be injected by
   it, but requires considerable processing power in the SPEP.  We
   assume that any authentication of the whole packet will most likely
   be performed by its recipient D, based on a security association it
   has with the sender C; R or any other SPEPs are not burdened with
   this authentication.  (However, some authentication offload in a
   last-hop router R may be desirable for a very constrained device D,
   at least if R and D have a robust security association that can
   provide the level of authentication needed.)

   Most likely, a token should include some information about what is
   included in the signing input.  (This information itself should then
   also be included in the signing input.)  This coverage information
   could take the form of a bitmap, or of a set of offset-length pairs.
   If coverage information and covered information is in a form that can
   be processed by a network processor, higher processing and forwarding
   rates can be achieved.

3.4.  Information (attributes) to be used on the way

   The original SWORN protocol provides one attribute beyond the
   authentication itself: a wake period to be used in the MAC layer that
   connects R and D.  This can be generalized to other parameters that
   control routing and forwarding, e.g., information that would be
   equivalent to a DSCP.

   An ambitious use case might be a path from a sender to a recipient
   that crosses multiple domains, where each domain boundary normally
   bleaches DSCP information coming in from the previous domain.

   The domain ingress router might check the SWORN information to be
   able to apply a policy not to bleach, or to install DSCP information
   specific to the domain it belongs to, or to operate on some DSCP-like
   information outside the DSCP field.

   Note that the model used by this extended version of SWORN is based
   on an assumption that it is in the interest of all players to
   cooperate in achieving the objectives.  Security is used to ensure
   that only actually authorized players can participate.  But, in
   general, the assumed trust and incentive models work best within a
   limited domain [RFC8799], which spans one or maybe two security
   domains only.

3.5.  Example arrangements

   This subsection discusses a number of example arrangements with more
   complex relationships between the players.  Once the set of clients
   starts to scale, the issue of key setup becomes significant.  In the
   best case, the SPEPs do not need to be provisioned (set up)
   separately for each separate client authorization.

   The arrangements presented here are based on symmetric cryptography,
   specifically MACs (message authentication codes).  The MACs are based
   on grant keys GK shared between the origin or a packet (or of a grant
   key, see below) and the enforcement point.  Several grant keys may
   need to be employed; they are differentiated in the names of
   variables defined in this section by using suffixes such as _z for
   authorization and _n for authentication, or _1 and _2 for consecutive
   steps.

   In these arrangements, grant keys are managed by "authorization
   managers" (AM, compare Figure 1); we simplify the discussion by
   mentioning only the client authorization manager (CAM), which
   actually may be in contact with other authorization managers closer
   to the SPEPs.  Some grant keys are shared only between CAM and the
   SPEPs, requiring the CAM to send a pre-computed MAC to the client;
   some grant keys are shared between CAM, Client C, and the SPEPs,
   allowing the client to compute MACs covering variable parts of the
   packets.

   The MACs of the example arrangements employ a mechanism to indicate
   which parts of the packet go into the signing input for the MAC, the
   _coverage area indication_, or cai for short, to be included in each
   actual packet.  The realization for this could contain a bitmap with
   bits that enable individual predefined fields (e.g., elements of the
   5-tuple), plus pointer/length information for the payload or other
   dynamic attributes that need to be checked.  As discussed above, the
   coverage area indication itself should also go into the signing input
   for the MAC.

   The notation "fields(cai_x)" stands for the actual content of the
   fields in the packet as enumerated by the coverage area indication
   cai_x.  If these fields are constant for the authorization conveyed
   by a grant key (as is often required by an ACL), they can be included
   in the derivation of the grant key; otherwise they are included in
   the computation of the MAC keyed by the grant key.

   Multiple MACs (based on a cai per MAC and separate GK) can be used in
   each packet.  This can be realized by including all of these MACs in
   a packet (possibly by simply XORing them), or by building one of the
   MACs into the signing input of another MAC.

Internet-Draft     SWORN: Secure Wake on Radio Nudging     February 2022


   We make the simplifying assumption that the IP address of the client
   can be used as a client ID; this is always available in the 5-tuple
   of the packet and can be included in a MAC via the coverage area
   indication.  We use Cx (C1, C2, ...) to discuss a specific client.

   Based on these common mechanisms, we discuss two arrangements in the
   rest of this section.  Other arrangements can be built; the
   information in the grants should enable the indication of the exact
   structure of the arrangement, enabling the AM to determine which
   specific arrangement is in use.

3.5.1.  Multiple Independent Grants

   In this example arrangement, the AM generates two different kinds of
   grants, GK_z for authorization checking over a range of clients, and
   GK_n_x that focuses only on authenticating the packet as originating
   from a specific client Cx.

   The corresponding MACs are used as follows: MAC_z contains
   information that the AM wants to define, i.e. AM sets the values of
   these fields; therefore MAC_z can be pre-computed by the AM.  MAC_n
   also contains information that the AM wants Cx to define, i.e. AM
   identifies the fields (sets cai) and lets Cx set the values of these
   fields.  (As an example, the wake_period of original SWORN would be
   in MAC_n.)

   GK_z is not provided to the clients, instead the CAM provides the
   client with a ready-made token complete with a MAC, called MAC_z,
   based on the grant key.  This token indicates authorization for its
   coverage area (typically elements of the 5-tuple, plus possibly some
   more dynamic attributes).  It is pre-computed for each client Cx and
   conveyed to Cx from the CAM; as there is no replay protection of the
   authorization, this token can be used essentially as a bearer token,
   until dynamic attributes or keys need to be updated (then a new
   authorization token needs to be sent from CAM to each Cx that shall
   continue to communicate).

   The SPEP also has GK_z and can check the tokens based on the
   information in the packet (and possibly cache e.g.  MAC_z for the
   flow, if not pre-computed from a table of client IDs).

   This approach alone does not protect against replay attacks.  For
   this, we introduce GK_n_x in corresponding client grants, carrying a
   client-specific authentication key.  Each GK_n_x is provided by the
   CAM to both an individual Cx and (indirectly via GK_z) to the SPEPs.
   The authentication key is used against a selected subset of the five-
   tuple, the dynamic attributes, and the payload.  It effectively
   proves that the holder of this key, Cx, is the actual originator of
   the packet.  It does not prove authorization of a specific five-tuple
   plus attributes; this is the job of the GK_z/MAC_z.

   Each packet carries MAC_z based on the shared grant key (bearer token
   supplied by CAM for a specific selection of elements from the
   5-tuple, proving that this communication with this selection of
   5-tuple elements is generally authorized.)  A typical selection from
   the 5-tuple would comprise the source (client) and destination
   (device) IP addresses as well as the destination port number and
   protocol; the source port number would remain dynamic to be chosen by
   the client in this case.  (MAC_z could also cover further attributes
   relevant to the authorization, such as an application-id or
   performance parameters such as intended maximum bitrate and traffic
   priority; some of these attributes could be included in the token,
   others could be derived from policy and an attribute such as an
   application-id.)

   We assume that the mechanisms discussed here need to provide source
   authentication for the packets from Cx.  If a separate source
   authentication mechanism is available, GK_n_x and MAC_n are not
   needed.  Otherwise, for authentication, each packet also carries
   MAC_n based on GK_n_x, which proves the actual origin of the packet;
   the authorization that applies to the packet needs to be checked via
   the authorization token.  The coverage area of MAC_n is indicated by
   cai_n; this will generally be a superset of cai_z and will include
   the source port number as well, so this can be freely chosen by the
   client but is still authenticated.

   The payload may or may not be included into the signing input to
   MAC_n (this is also indicated by cai_n).  If the payload is included,
   this ensures that an attacker can only replay completely identical
   packets; in situations where this kind of replay would not be a
   problem, no replay window mechanism needs to be employed.

   In summary (bracket notation [..., ...] stands for an array of
   values):

   MAC_z = MAC([cai_z, fields(cai_z), attributes, cai_n, timestamp],
   GK_z)

   MAC_n = MAC([serial, cai_n, fields(cai_n)], GK_n_x)

   where the CAM provides to Cx:

   *  GK_n_x = KDF(["key for MAC_n", CxID, GK_z])

   *  all other inputs to MAC_z except for timestamp

   *  MAC_z

   The actual information in the packet contains the token:

   Token =
      [cai_z, cai_n, GK_z-kid, CxID, attributes_conveyed,
         (MAC_z xor MAC_n_x)]

   The provisioning needed is limited to distributing grant keys GK_z
   for each specific authorization (e.g., Device IP address/port number)
   plus a base key GK_n_x to derive authentication keys for each client
   Cx.  These are connected by the common parts of the 5-tuple and a
   CxID.

   The role of the different keys can be summarized as follows:

   *  GK_z, known only by AM and the SPEPs, allows the AM to specify the
      authorization information, which then can be checked by the SPEP
      using MAC_z under the key GK_z.

      Since the AM can compute the MAC_z ahead of time, from the point
      of view of the client MAC_z essentially serves as a bearer token,
      which however is only useful for packets with the fields(cai_z)
      that are being authorized by AM.

   *  GK_n_x provides client x with a way to authenticate a wider
      coverage, including values of the client's choice such as the
      source port number or even the payload.  Here, client x needs to
      have the key so it can dynamically vary these fields without
      needing to recur to AM.

3.5.2.  Hierarchical Grants

   Section 3.5.1 requires distributing separate authentication grants
   for each client Cx to each SPEP, which may however be orthogonal to
   the specific authorizations granted.

   We cannot completely eliminate per-client "provisioning" as SPEP
   needs to know about the authorization it needs to enforce.  However,
   by giving clients (e.g., C1/C2) more specific information than SPEP,
   we can relieve SPEP from needing to know each of C1/C2 a priori, as
   follows:

   Let GK0 be the _generic grant Key_, which is generated by CAM and
   told to the SPEPs in a generic grant.  Clients never obtain GK0.

   Let GKx be a _specific grant Key_, which is generated by CAM for each
   Cx and told to Cx in a _specific grant_. Client x only knows its own
   GKx, not that of other clients Cy.

   For a complete exposition, we also introduce cai_1 and cai_2:

   *  Both cai_1 and fields(cai_1) are shared between CAM and SPEP in a
      generic grant; fields(cai_1) are the constant parts of the packets
      to be authorized (e.g., device IP address, device port number).

   *  cai_2 is a superset of cai_1; it indicates the fields that need to
      be checked by SPEP.  The generic grant provides cai_2, but not
      fields(cai_2), as these can differ per packet and are chosen by
      Cx.

   Ignoring nonces, serials, and key identifier/lifetime/rollover
   mechanisms, the following computations can be done:

   *  by CAM or SPEP (who both know GK0 and cai_1, i.e. generic
      information about all packets covered by this grant):

      Grant_x = [GK0-kid, cai_1, cai_2, fields(cai_1), GKx]

      where GKx = KDF([cai_1, cai_2, fields(cai_1), GK0])

   *  by Cx based on its provisioned GKx and a specific packet, but also
      by SPEP based on the GKx the SPEP can compute for Cx

      token = [GK0-kid, cai_1, cai_2, MAC([serial, cai_2,
      fields(cai_2)], GKx)]

   (These computations do not explicitly mention a client ID, which is
   implied by the source IP address included in fields(cai__n_).)

   Note that the token can be verified by SPEP as it can compute GKx
   from the secret key GK0 that is only shared between CAM and SPEP, as
   long as it knows which GK0 to apply (e.g., using GK0-kid, which here
   simply is copied into the token).  As they don't know GK0, the
   individual clients Cx cannot compute GKx -- they need to obtain it
   from CAM as part of Grant_x, which also gives them cai_1 and cai_2 --
   containing the information for Cx how to apply the GKx.  The token,
   computed from GKx, therefore authenticates Cx as the holder of xGKx,
   and signifies the authorization of Cx to send a packet with
   fields(cai_1) as indicated in GKx, with the additional requirement on
   Cx that it also authenticates a serial number (used for replay
   protection) and additional fields(cai_2).

   Since the token includes the relevant parts of the 5-tuple, and cai_1
   is part of the first MAC and therefore cannot be changed by the Cxes,
   there is no need to apply any additional ACL beyond feeding the cai-
   selected fields of the packet into the MAC.

   So GK0 only needs to be provisioned once to the SPEPs for all Cxes;
   each GKx is provisioned only to Cx.  An SPEP can compute GKx from
   cai_1, cai_2 (part of the token) and fields(cai_1) (taken from the
   packet).  GKx is eminently cacheable, but in any case does _not_ need
   to be provisioned as it can be derived from GK0 and information that
   is in the packet.

   C1 and C2 have GK1 and GK2, respectively; the coverage area is easily
   extended to include D1-address and D1-port etc., by setting the bits
   in either cai_1 (if these are fixed for Cx) or cai_2 (if these can be
   chosen by Cx).

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  Original SWORN model

   Define CBOR Wake-Token Tag 1398230866 in [IANA.cbor-tags].

   Define CoAP option Wake-Token in the CoAP Option Numbers Registry of
   [IANA.core-parameters] (Section 12.2 of [RFC7252].  (The option is
   safe, no-cache-key, elective, repeatable, of type opaque 0-255
   bytes.)

   Define media-type "application/dtls-payload", with an associated CoAP
   Content-Format in the CoAP Content-Formats Registry of
   [IANA.core-parameters] (Section 12.3 of [RFC7252].

4.2.  Generalized model

   TBD

5.  Security Considerations

   The purpose of the security mechanisms described is primarily to
   protect availability (obviously, any symmetric keys employed also
   need to be confidentiality protected for the sake of the integrity of
   the mechanism).  For the purposes of this kind of availability
   protection, occasional false positives of the per-packet
   authorization mechanisms may be acceptable, as long as they don't
   reach a threshold of probability of success that is application
   dependent (say, success in one out of a million of brute force
   attempts, equivalent to 20-bit security).  This may offer
   optimization opportunities that need further study.

   TBD
