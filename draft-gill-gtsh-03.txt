                                Abstract

   The use of a packet's TTL (IPv4) or Hop Limit (IPv6) to protect a
   protocol stack from CPU-utilization based attacks has been proposed
   in many settings (see for example, RFC 2461). This document
   generalizes these techniques for use by other protocols such as BGP
   (RFC 1771), MSDP, Bidirectional Forwarding Detection, and LDP (RFC
   3036). While the Generalized TTL Security Mechanism (GTSM)  is most
   effective in protecting directly connected protocol peers, it can
   also provide a lower level of protection to multi-hop sessions. GTSM
   is not directly applicable to protocols employing flooding mechanisms
   (e.g., multicast), and use of multi-hop GTSM should be considered on
   a case-by-case basis.

1.  Introduction

   The Generalized TTL Security Mechanism (GTSM) is designed to protect
   a router's TCP/IP based control plane from CPU-utilization based
   attacks. In particular, while cryptographic techniques can protect
   the router-based infrastructure (e.g., BGP [RFC1771]) from a wide
   variety of attacks, many attacks based on CPU overload can be
   prevented by the simple mechanism described in this document. Note
   that the same technique protects against other scarce-resource
   attacks involving a router's CPU, such as attacks against processor-
   line card bandwidth.

   GTSM is based on the fact that the vast majority of protocol peerings
   are established between routers that are adjacent [PEERING]. Thus
   most protocol peerings are either directly between connected
   interfaces or at the worst case, are between loopback and loopback,
   with static routes to loopbacks. Since TTL spoofing is considered
   nearly impossible, a mechanism based on an expected TTL value can
   provide a simple and reasonably robust defense from infrastructure
   attacks based on forged protocol packets.

INTERNET-DRAFT             Expires: April 2004              October 2003


   Finally, the GTSM mechanism is equally applicable to both TTL (IPv4)
   and Hop Limit (IPv6), and from the perspective of GTSM, TTL and Hop
   Limit have identical semantics. As a result, in the remainder of this
   document the term "TTL" is used to refer to both TTL or Hop Limit (as
   appropriate).



2.  Assumptions Underlying GTSM


   GTSM is predicated upon the following assumptions:

    (i).   The vast majority of protocol peerings are between adjacent
           routers [PEERING].

    (ii).  It is common practice for many service providers to
           ingress filter (deny) packets that have the provider's
           loopback addresses as the source IP address.

    (iii). Use of GTSM is OPTIONAL, and can be configured on a
           per-peer (group) basis.

    (iv).  The router supports a method of classifying traffic
           destined for the route processor into interesting/control
           and not-control queues.

    (iv).  The peer routers both implement GTSM.



2.1.  GTSM Negotiation


   This document assumes that GTSM will be manually configured between
   protocol peers. That is, no automatic GTSM capability negotiation,
   such as is envisioned by RFC 2842 [RFC2842] is assumed or defined.



2.2.  Assumptions on Attack Sophistication


   Throughout this document, we assume that potential attackers have
   evolved in both sophistication and access to the point that they can
   send control traffic to a protocol session, and that this traffic
   appears to be valid control traffic (i.e., has the source/destination
   of configured peer routers).



Gill, Heasley, and Meyer                          Section 2.2.  [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT             Expires: April 2004              October 2003


   We also assume that each router in the path between the attacker and
   the victim protocol speaker decrements TTL properly (clearly, if
   either the path or the adjacent peer is compromised, then there are
   worse problems to worry about).

   Since the vast majority of our peerings are between adjacent routers,
   we can set the TTL on the protocol packets to 255 (the maximum
   possible for IP) and then reject any protocol packets that come in
   from configured peers which do NOT have an inbound TTL of 255.

   GTSM can be disabled for applications such as route-servers and other
   large diameter multi-hop peerings. In the event that an the attack
   comes in from a compromised multi-hop peering, that peering can be
   shut down (a method to reduce exposure to multi-hop attacks is
   outlined below).



3.  GTSM Procedure


   GTSM SHOULD NOT be enabled by default. The following process
   describes the per-peer behavior:

    (i).  If GTSM is enabled, an implementation performs the
          following procedure:

          (a). For directly connected routers,

               o Set the outbound TTL for the protocol connection to
                 255.

               o For each configured protocol peer:

                 Update the receive path Access Control List (ACL)
                 or firewall to only allow protocol packets to pass
                 onto the Route Processor (RP) that have the correct
                 <source, destination, TTL> tuple. The TTL must
                 either be 255 (for a directly connected peer), or
                 255-(configured-range-of-acceptable-hops)
                 for a multi-hop peer. We specify a range here to
                 achieve some robustness to changes in topology. Any
                 directly connected check MUST be disabled for such
                 peerings.

                 It is assumed that a receive path ACL is an ACL
                 that is designed to control which packets are
                 allowed to go to the RP. This procedure will only



Gill, Heasley, and Meyer                            Section 3.  [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT             Expires: April 2004              October 2003


                 allow protocol packets from adjacent router to pass
                 onto the RP.

          (b). If the inbound TTL is 255 (for a directly connected
               peer), or 255-(configured-range-of-acceptable-hops)
               (for multi-hop peers), the packet is NOT
               processed. Rather, the packet is placed into a low
               priority queue, and subsequently logged and/or
               silently discarded. In this case, an ICMP message
               MUST NOT be generated.

    (ii). If GTSM is not enabled, normal protocol behavior is followed.



3.1.  Multi-hop Scenarios


   When a multi-hop protocol session is required, we set the expected
   TTL value to be 255-(configured-range-of-acceptable-hops).  This
   approach provides a qualitatively lower degree of security for the
   protocol implementing GTSM (i.e., an DoS attack could be
   theoretically be launched by compromising some box in the path).
   However, GTSM will still catch the vast majority of observed DDoS
   attacks against a given protocol. Note that since the number of hops
   can change rapidly in real network situations, it is considered that
   GTSM may not be able to handle this scenario adequately and an
   implementation MAY provide OPTIONAL support.



3.1.1.  Intra-domain Protocol Handling


   In general, GTSM is not used for intra-domain protocol peers or
   adjacencies. The special case of iBGP peers can be protected by
   filtering at the network edge for any packet that has a source
   address of one of the loopback addresses used for the intra-domain
   peering. In addition, the current best practice is to further protect
   such peers or adjacencies with an MD5 signature [RFC2385].

5.  Acknowledgments


   The use of the TTL field to protect BGP originated with many
   different people, including Paul Traina and Jon Stewart. Ryan
   McDowell also suggested a similar idea. Steve Bellovin, Jay
   Borkenhagen, Randy Bush, Vern Paxon, Pekka Savola, and Robert Raszuk
   also provided useful feedback on earlier versions of this document.
   David Ward provided insight on the generalization of the original
   BGP-specific idea.



6.  Security Considerations


   GTSM is a simple procedure that protects single hop protocol
   sessions, except in those cases in which the peer has been
   compromised.





6.1.  TTL (Hop Limit) Spoofing


   The approach described here is based on the observation that a TTL
   (or Hop Limit) value of 255 is non-trivial to spoof, since as the



Gill, Heasley, and Meyer                          Section 6.1.  [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT             Expires: April 2004              October 2003


   packet passes through routers towards the destination, the TTL is
   decremented by one. As a result, when a router receives a packet, it
   may not be able to determine if the packet's IP address is valid, but
   it can determine how many router hops away it is (again, assuming
   none of the routers in the path are compromised in such a way that
   they would reset the packet's TTL).

   Note, however, that while engineering a packet's TTL such that it has
   a particular value when sourced from an arbitrary location is
   difficult (but not impossible), engineering a TTL value of 255 from
   non-directly connected locations is not possible (again, assuming
   none of the directly connected neighbors are compromised, the packet
   hasn't been tunneled to the decapsulator, and the intervening routers
   are operating in accordance with RFC 791 [RFC791]).



6.2.  Tunneled Packets


   An exception to the observation that a packet with TTL of 255 is
   difficult to spoof occurs when a protocol packet is tunneled to a
   decapsulator who then forwards the packet to a directly connected
   protocol peer. In this case the decapsulator (tunnel endpoint) can
   either be the penultimate hop, or the last hop itself. A related case
   arises when the protocol packet is tunneled directly to the protocol
   peer (the protocol peer is the decapsulator).

   When the protocol packet is encapsulated in IP, it is possible to
   spoof the TTL. It may also be impossible to legitimately get the
   packet to the protocol peer with a TTL of 255, as in the IP in MPLS
   cases described below.



6.2.1.  IP in IP


   Protocol packets may be tunneled over IP directly to a protocol peer,
   or to a decapsulator (tunnel endpoint) that then forwards the packet
   to a directly connected protocol peer (e.g., in IP-in-IP [RFC2003],
   GRE [RFC2784], or various forms of IPv6-in-IPv4 [RFC2839]). These
   cases are depicted below.








Gill, Heasley, and Meyer                        Section 6.2.1.  [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT             Expires: April 2004              October 2003


    Peer router ---------- Tunnel endpoint router and peer
     TTL=255     [tunnel]   [TTL=255 at ingress]
                            [TTL=255 at egress]


    Peer router ---------- Tunnel endpoint router ----- On-link peer
     TTL=255     [tunnel]   [TTL=255 at ingress]     [TTL=254 at ingress]
                            [TTL=254 at egress]

   In the first case, in which the encapsulated packet is tunneled
   directly to the protocol peer, the encapsulated packet's TTL can be
   set arbitrary value. In the second case, in which the encapsulated
   packet is tunneled to a decapsulator (tunnel endpoint) which then
   forwards it to a directly connected protocol peer, RFC 2003 specifies
   the following behavior:

    When encapsulating a datagram, the TTL in the inner IP
    header is decremented by one if the tunneling is being
    done as part of forwarding the datagram; otherwise, the
    inner header TTL is not changed during encapsulation.  If
    the resulting TTL in the inner IP header is 0, the
    datagram is discarded and an ICMP Time Exceeded message
    SHOULD be returned to the sender.  An encapsulator MUST
    NOT encapsulate a datagram with TTL = 0.

   Hence the inner IP packet header's TTL, as seen by the decapsulator,
   can be set to an arbitrary value (in particular, 255). As a result,
   it may not be possible to deliver the protocol packet to the peer
   with a TTL of 255.



6.2.2.  IP in MPLS


   Protocol packets may also be tunneled over MPLS to a protocol peer
   which either the penultimate hop (when the penultimate hop popping
   (PHP) is employed [RFC3032]), or one hop beyond the penultimate hop.
   These cases are depicted below.

    Peer router ---------- Penultimate Hop (PH) and peer
     TTL=255     [tunnel]   [TTL=255 at ingress]
                            [TTL<=254 at egress]


    Peer router ---------- Penultimate Hop  -------- On-link peer
     TTL=255     [tunnel]   [TTL=255 at ingress]  [TTL <=254 at ingress]
                            [TTL<=254 at egress]



Gill, Heasley, and Meyer                        Section 6.2.2.  [Page 9]

INTERNET-DRAFT             Expires: April 2004              October 2003


   TTL handling for these cases is described in RFC 3032.  RFC 3032
   states that when the IP packet is first labeled:

    ... the TTL field of the label stack entry MUST BE set to the
    value of the IP TTL field.  (If the IP TTL field needs to be
    decremented, as part of the IP processing, it is assumed that
    this has already been done.)

   When the label is popped:

    When a label is popped, and the resulting label stack is empty,
    then the value of the IP TTL field SHOULD BE replaced with the
    outgoing TTL value, as defined above.  In IPv4 this also
    requires modification of the IP header checksum.

   where the definition of "outgoing TTL" is:

    The "incoming TTL" of a labeled packet is defined to be the
    value of the TTL field of the top label stack entry when the
    packet is received.

    The "outgoing TTL" of a labeled packet is defined to be the larger of:

      a) one less than the incoming TTL,
      b) zero.

   In either of these cases, the minimum value by which the TTL could be
   decremented would be one (the network operator prefers to hide its
   infrastructure by decrementing the TTL by the minimum number of LSP
   hops, one, rather than decrementing the TTL as it traverses its MPLS
   domain). As a result, the maximum TTL value at egress from the MPLS
   cloud is 254 (255-1), and as a result the check described in section
   3 will fail.

   Finally, the security of any tunneling technique depends heavily on
   authentication at the tunnel endpoints, as well as how the tunneled
   packets are protected in flight. Such mechanisms are, however, beyond
   the scope of this memo.



6.3.  Multi-Hop Protocol Sessions


   While the GTSM method is less effective for multi-hop protocol
   sessions, it does close the window on several forms of attack.
   However, in the multi-hop scenario GTSM is an OPTIONAL extension.
   Protection of the protocol infrastructure beyond what is provided by



Gill, Heasley, and Meyer                         Section 6.3.  [Page 10]

INTERNET-DRAFT             Expires: April 2004              October 2003


   the GTSM method will likely require cryptographic machinery such as
   is envisioned by Secure BGP (S-BGP) [SBGP1,SBGP2], and/or other
   extensions. Finally, note that in the multi-hop case described above,
   we specify a range of acceptable TTLs in order to achieve some
   robustness to topology changes. This robustness to topological change
   comes at the cost of the loss some robustness to different forms of
   attack.
