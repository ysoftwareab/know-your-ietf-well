2. Abstract

This document describes virtual private LAN service (VPLS) solution
over MPLS, called Generic VPLS/LPE (GVPLS) that emulates a partial
bridging functionality [802.1D] to connect customers LANs/VLANs
across the Metro and WAN Service Provider networks. This
functionality includes the MAC learning and forwarding to emulate
connectivity between the customer LANs/VLANs. This is a partial
bridging functionality since it is transparent to customer topology
and STP protocol.

For VPLS solutions, the VPLS Reference Model [VPLS-L2-FRW]
introduces two types of models: distributed and non-distributed.

While [VPLS] solution presents a non-distributed model, it is
recognized that both models may need to co-exist in the same SP
network. This implies a need of a unified provisioning model with
signalling mechanisms to support these new classes of solutions. The
MAC learning process and the scalability in terms of number of VPLSs
and number of customer ports can be increased significantly if some
optimisations are provided in the Control and Data plane.

The current draft presents the GVPLS solution that extend 
the [VPLS] solution  and addresses such issues. In addition an improvement
model for Mulitpoint to Point PW (M2P) is presented. The term 
"Generic" in this document is used to reflect the unified aspect of
the two models.

4. Introduction

This document describes virtual private LAN service (VPLS) solution
over MPLS, called Generic VPLS/LPE (GVPLS) that emulates a partial
bridging functionality to connect customers LANs/VLANs across the
Metro and WAN Service Provider networks. This functionality includes
the MAC learning and forwarding to emulate connectivity between the
customer LANs/VLANs. This is a partial bridging functionality since
it is transparent to customer topology and STP.

4.1 Overview

Following [LPE] and [L2-FRW], regardless of the signalling and auto-
discovery protocols, two paradigms can be identified for the VPLS
solutions:

- Non-distributed model - the MAC learning/forwarding and VPLS
forwarding is done in a PE device
- Distributed model - the VPLS functionality and MAC
learning/forwarding is distributed in the U-PE devices, and the
VPLS forwarding in the N-PE devices.

[VPLS] describes a non-distributed solution where the VPLS
functionality is concentrated in the PE device. The solution is
enhanced with a hierarchical model (called HVPLS), between U-PE and
N-PE devices, which allows scaling the number of Pseudo-Wires in 
Metro core. The U-PE and N-PE devices are connected via P2P Pseudo-Wires

or Ethernet access networks, and both devices would perform customers
MAC learning and forwarding.

Internet Draft    draft-radoaca-ppvpn-gvpls-01.txt    Feb 2003

Following the Reference Model for VPLS in [L2-FRW], and [LPE] the
GVPLS solution extends and complements the non-distributed model
[VPLS] in order to support the distributed model. In this respect,
GVPLS extends the [VPLS] model in two key areas: access network and
core network.

The access network is extended with a new type of U-PE device that
is capable to perform the VPLS service, with or without the N-PE
devices. Therefore, such devices would perform MAC learning and
forwarding to other U-PE devices and may perform auto-discovery and
signalling of the VPN membership. In order to enable and scale such
model, besides PWs [PWE3-CTRL] usage, or Q-in-Q [Q-in-Q], new 
encapsulation methods may be proposed, such as [MAC-in-MAC].

The U-PE devices can be connected with core network via a 
Switched Ethernet Transport (SET). The SET is considered to be the
Ethernet access network when the traffic between U-PEs can be switched
without the involvement of the N-PEs.

>From the VPLS core perspective, there are two ways to build a
distributed model:
- using Point to Point PW [P2P]
- using Multipoint to Point PW [M2P]

The P2P-PWs are defined in [L2-FRW]. The first option is discussed
in [ROSEN] and [DTLS] and presented also in the current GVPLS
solution, as the default component. The second option would be discussed
in the present document and represents a key contribution of the proposal.

As a key requirement, GVPLS  integrates both non-distributed and
distributed models, so different VPN members that are provisioned in both
models can participate in the same VPLS instance. In addition, we
would discuss how  the N-PE device can perform both the VPLS and
GVPLS solutions, using the same architectural framework.

4.2 Attributes of the distributed model

It is recognized that SP may deploy the non-distributed model and/or
the distributed model, based on different vendors' solutions,
scalability, reach-ability and port density requirements.

While the non-distributed model has values, like simplicity,
easy of  deployment and manageability, it is well recognized that
the distributed model has some compelling attributes:
1. Allow to deploy VPLS solutions using only the U-PE devices, without
the MPLS/IP core amongst them. However, such VPLS access networks
can be interconnected using MPLS/IP Metro core technology.

2. Allow to deploy, in flexible way, the U-PE devices in the COs or
close to the CPE devices. Also, by dividing the work between the U-PE
and N-PE devices, the single point of failure [like in the case of 
non-distributed model] is eliminated. With GVPLS model, even the N-PE 
failure will allow the U-PE devices on the same access network still
to work.

Internet Draft    draft-radoaca-ppvpn-gvpls-01.txt    Feb 2003

3. Allow to create access networks where a significant percentage
of the traffic would stay local, without involving the N-PE
devices in switching such traffic. This would free resources for
the N-PE devices to perform other vital functions like L3 VPNs,
or high touch services.
4. Allow a large number of VPNs to be deployed in the SP domain -
this is a direct result of eliminating MAC learning in the N-PE
devices, hence MAC explosion in the Metro core.

In addition, by mixing the two models, a SP can incrementally
deploy the VPLS service, based on the complex characteristics of the
metro [such as customer density, diversity of the Ethernet ports,
co-existence with legacy SDH/SONET infrastructure]. A VPLS offer
can start from an access network, only with the U-PE devices,
upgraded with an MPLS core, or can start from a non-distributed
model and upgraded to a distributed model if the scalability
parameters require such extension.

4.3 Functional components

GVPLS extends the functional components described in [VPLS] in order
to accommodate the distributed model. As such the following
components are discussed:
- control plane
	- signalling
	- auto-discovery
- data plane
- provisioning

It is worth to note that the current document describes only what is
essential for the distributed model, and the extensions to the
[VPLS] description that is considered as the base line. As such,
some functional components would be referred directly to the [VPLS]
document.

4.4 GVPLS Topological model 

The GVPLS topological model is described in the figure 1.

                           Figure 1

The VPLS model [VPLS] is extended with the new type of devices,
called U-PE [L2-FRW], that supports VPLS functionality. Such devices
would inter-work with the N-PE or [VPLS] MTU devices capable of the
VPLS functionality.

5. Information Model

The Information model describes the essential information for the
VPLS Service and the SP network in order to do consistent
provisioning, discovering and signalling tasks. Also, the same
information data should be used by competing protocols [ex. BGP
versus LDP in signalling] for the same functionality.

5.1 VPN-ID

A SP refers to a given VPLS by a VPN-ID [VPLS]. Such VPN-ID should be
unique in the SP context. 

5.2 Device Ids

In GVPLS, the following device ids are defined:
- N-PE-id, which identifies a N-PE device
- U-PE-id, which identifies a U-PE device
A device ID is encoded as 6 bytes long, is unique in the SP scope,
and it's representation is a matter of the SP address scheme.

5.3 SP address scheme

A distributed model is built around a specific SP address scheme
that would allow the customer packets to be classified, encapsulated
and forwarded solely based on such scheme. Following the [L2-FRW]
reference model, the U-PE devices [or U-PE interface ports] can be
used to encode such SP address scheme.

The SP address scheme has the following basic attributes:

- SRC-ID [or SRC-U-PE-ID] represents the address of the originator
U-PE [or N-PE] device, or U-PE Interface
- DST-ID [or DST-U-PE-ID] represents the address of the destination
U-PE [or N-PE] device, or U-PE Interface



Radoaca, et. al   Expires: August 2003               [Page 7]
Internet Draft    draft-radoaca-ppvpn-gvpls-01.txt    Feb 2003

- VPN-ID represents the ID of a given VPN
- VPN-FLG a set of bits that represents some conditions on the
packet forwarding such multicast, OAM/continuity check, and so on.
Most of the VPN-FLG bits can be advertised on the VPLS Control
plane [In the current GVPLS solution, the only flag that is mapped in
Data plane is the OAM flag].

There are different ways to encode such scheme:
  - using MAC address of the U-PE/N-PE devices [MAC-in-MAC] or
MAC Addresses of U-PE access ports, when the U-PE devices are not bridge
capable
  - using SP Ids of the U-PE/N-PE devices or SP Ids of U-PE access
ports, when the U-PE devices are not bridge capable
  - etc.

The SP address scheme can be mapped into underlying access
protocols, such Q-in-Q [Q-in-Q], MAC-in-MAC [MAC-In-MAC], or 
[PWE3-ETHERNET].

In the distributed model, the U-PE  devices are enhanced to perform
SP encapsulation with the following information: (SRC-ID, DST-ID,
VPN-ID, VPN-FLG). In addition, the U-PE devices would perform MAC
learning and forwarding against the SRC-ID and DST-ID parameters.
Once a packet arrives to the destination U-PE, the device would
perform forwarding decision based on the customer MAC addresses.

Note: Based on these assumptions, a VPLS service can be built without N-PE
devices - this would allow to deploy the VPLS service in small metro
access networks and to join them using the MPLS/IP [VPLS Core] core
network, via GVPLS solution.

5.4 Information Model entities

The GVPLS terminology is based on the [L2-FRW] and VPLS. GVPLS uses
the following information model enities:

PE - Provider Edge
Based on the [L2-FRW] model, for distributed VPLS case, two types of
device are described:
- U-PE - User facing PE
- N-PE - Network facing PE

VC-LSP
[PWE3-CTRL] defines how to carry L2 PDUs over point-to-point
MPLS LSPs, called VC LSPs. Such VC LSPs can be carried across MPLS
or GRE tunnels. The VC-LSPs can be distributed between the U-PE and
N-PE devices, and between the N-PE devices.

VC-Label

VC-Label (or Service Label) identifies the multiplexing value, or
the service label on top of the MPLS  tunnels.

Internet Draft    draft-radoaca-ppvpn-gvpls-01.txt    Feb 2003

VPLS Port (VP)
It represents a physical or a logical port where a VPLS is
provisioned. Such port can reside on the U-PE or N-PE device. A CE
is connected to the VPLS Port. The VPLS Port can be provisioned with
a VLAN[802.1D-ORIG] , a set of VLANs or transparent (in this case, all
the traffic on such port is accepted on the VPLS). Transparent and 
VLAN ports can be mixed in a VPLS scope.

VPLS EndPoint (VEP)
The VPLS EndPoint is used to represents the destination where a
packet is to be forwarded, or from where the packet is coming, as
the originating source. The VEP represents:

- A U-PE and N-PE device which contains a minimum one VPLS port, if
the device is capable to forward the packet based on MAC
destination to its VPLS ports
- A VPLS port, if the above condition doesn't hold

The VEP-ID attribute stores the device id, which value can be: U-PE-
id or N-PE-id. Ingress VEP-ID is known as SRC-ID while the egress
VEP-ID is known DST-ID.

Source Control Flag (src-cflag)

It identifies the encoding mechanism for the ingress VEP. The
VC-Labels calculation and the MAC source learning process are
dependent on this flag.

Service Header

The service header is used to tag the customer traffic through
the Service Provider access network, i.e. SET. It is used to
effectively identify the VPN that the customer belongs to.
Also, it may contains VPN Flags that are needed in order to forward
the traffic independently of the N-PE devices - example:
M: denotes the port type (it's transparent or mapped)
C: denotes the traffic type (it's customer or OAM  type)
There are different methods to encapsulate such Service Header, like
Q-in-Q, MAC-in-MAC and so on.

End-to-End Path Identification

An end-to-end path between a given U-PE source and a  given U-PE
destination can be described as a t-upl: (SRC-U-PE-ID, DST-U-PE-ID,
VPN-ID).

In the VPLS core, such path should be mapped on PWs (P2P, or
M2P). As we will see later, there are possible multiple paths to
same DST-ID, due to the Traffic engineering or dual homing
connections of the U-PE devices.

Let's call the N-PE device that is attached to the SRC-U-PE device
as SRC-N-PE, and the N-PE device that is attached to the DST-U-PE
device as DST-N-PE.

Internet Draft    draft-radoaca-ppvpn-gvpls-01.txt    Feb 2003

A VPLS core PW path that is built between two different N-PE devices (SRC
and DST), is defined as a t-upl with the following information:
<<SRC-U-PE-id, SRC-N-PE-id, VPN-ID>, <DST-U-PE-ID, DST-N-PE-ID ,VPN-
ID >>.

Mutlipoint to Point PW (M2P PW)

A Multipoint to point PW  is defined by a set of VC-LSPs that
originate from different sources (ex. N-PE-Ids) and terminate in one U-
PE-ID destination. For M2P PW the SRC-U-PE-id is set to zero - however,
the SRC-U-PE-id information is transported in the data path by using
different methods, like the Control Word [PWE3-CTRL].

The above concepts are shown in the figure 2.

| SRC-U-PE  |    |SRC-N-PE|              |DST-N-PE|   |DST-U-PE|
+-----------+    +--------+              +--------+   +--------+
                              VPLS PW (VPN-ID)
                   < --------------------- >
                          End-to-End Path (VPN-ID)
     < --------------------------------------------------- >

                          Figure 2

5.5 SP Address scheme mapping to the VPLS core

As described in section above, the key aspect of the distributed
model is to provide some sort of SP address scheme, so the customer
packets can be forwarded in the SP domain, using only the SP address
scheme.

In the distributed model, the SP address scheme encompasses the
following attributes, SRC-ID, DST-ID, VPN-FLG, VPN-ID. Consequently,
in the access network, the customer packets should be encapsulated
with the above information.

In order for the N-PE device to forward the traffic from the access
Network (that comes with VPN-ID, SRC-ID, DST-ID information), toward 
the core, it needs to find a PW, with the following match criteria:
- VPN-ID of the PW
- DST-ID equal with the DST-U-PE-ID of the PW

When, following this match criteria, different PWs result to the
same destination, then  other criteria (policy based) can be used to
select one of the PW. As we can realize, the binding between the
access protocols [ex. Attachment circuits] and VPLS LSPs is done in
the data plane.

5.6 N-PE's VSI and FIBs

The N-PE VSI [L2-FRW] can be decomposed in two logical entities:

Internet Draft    draft-radoaca-ppvpn-gvpls-01.txt    Feb 2003


- VSI-U that performs MAC learning, identification of DST-ID and
forwarding toward the DST-ID
- VSI-N that performs mapping between DST-ID and the PW ( or Set of
PWs) that leads to the DST-ID.

The VSI-U FIB is built using the standard bridging functionality. 

The VSI-N FIB is built using two lists:
-local-list  <SRC-ID: SRC-U-PE-ID, SRC-N-PE-ID, VPN-ID>
-remote-list <DST-ID: DST-U-PE-ID, DST-N-PE-ID, VPN-ID>

Each t-upl <<SRC-U-PE-id, SRC-N-PE-id, VPN-ID>, <DST-U-PE-ID,DST-N-
PE-ID, VPN-ID>> defines a PW or a list of PWs that can forward the
customer traffic from the SRC-ID to the DST-ID and reverse.

In the case of non-distributed model [VPLS], the SRC-ID field is
equal with SRC-N-PE-ID and the DST-ID is equal with DST-N-PE-ID. The
SRC-N-PE-ID and DST-N-PE-ID can be set to NULL.
This shows that both models can be accommodated within the same VSI
infrastructure. It also important to note that from VSI perspective
it is transparent if the SRC-ID or DST-ID represents a U-PE or an N-
PE device. This also implies that U-PE-ID and N-PE-ID need to have
the same representation and to be unique across of the SP network.

In the non-distributed model the N-PE VSI-U is not used, because
such functionality would be performed by the U-PE device. In
addition, the U-PE device would deliver the packet with <SRC-ID,
DST-ID, VPN-ID, VPN-FLG> information.

The VSI-N would perform forwarding decision, regardless if the
packet is coming from the local VSI-U or from the subtended U-PE
device.

Further optimizations can be done if we assume that U-PE-ID and N-
PE-ID are represented as MAC addresses, like in MAC-in-MAC proposal.
In this case, the VSI-U and VSI-N can use the same FIB.

6. Control Plane

The following section describes the  Auto-Discovery,
Signaling and Provisioning.

6.1 Provisioning and Auto-discovery

As we mentioned above, the VP is the port on the U-PE device (or a
port on N-PE device, when CE connects directly to N-PE) where a VPLS
is provisioned. The VP,VPN-ID, VLAN(s) and other attributes (like
QoS, etc.) define the VPN Member information.

The VPLS provisioning has the following steps:



Radoaca, et. al   Expires: August 2003               [Page 11]
Internet Draft    draft-radoaca-ppvpn-gvpls-01.txt    Feb 2003


1. Each N-PE has knowledge about any remote N-PE [using N-PE-ID]. In
order to get such information, an auto-discovery protocol can be
used (ex. BGP ). Following this step, the LDP sessions and/or VPLS
tunnels are provisioned/generated between the N-PE devices

2. Each N-PE has knowledge about the subtended access network, so
all the U-PE devices [using U-PE-ID] are known to the N-PE. This
can be done via an access auto-discovery protocol (ex. LDP)
for PWs or using the data plane bridging mode for MAC-in-MAC.
As a result of configuration/auto-discovery process, the N-PE 
device will be given a list of U-PE devices.

3. A VPLS instance with a given VPN-ID is provisioned in each N-PE
device that would be part of that VPLS scope. Following this
step, a set of P2P PWs are generated between the corresponding N-
PE devices (as in [VPLS])
4. The VPLS VPN Members are provisioned on the U-PE interfaces [or
N-PE interfaces]. The following information is propagated
from the local U-PE/N-PE, to each remote N-PE:
  <VPN Member, U-PE-ID, N-PE-ID >
Following this step, each N-PE device builds a VSI-N FIB
table with the following information: < VPN-Member-local-list: VPN-
Member-remote-list>. This process can be completed by using an auto
discovery protocol.

For each pair <VPN-Member-local, VPN-Member-remote> a PW (P2P, or
M2P) is created with the corresponding remote N-PE. In the signaling
message the following data should be sent: <<SRC-U-PE-id, SRC-N-PE-
id, VPN-ID>, <DST-U-PE-ID, DST-N-PE-ID, VPN-ID>>. The SRC indicates
the local VP and DST indicate the remote VP. For the M2P PW the DST-
U-PE-ID is set to zero - in other words for M2P, the signalling
process doesn't need to know the remote VPN Members.

Note for the [VPLS] model

In the VPLS model [VPLS], the LDP Label Mapping message has the 
SRC-U-PE-id and the DST-U-PE-id set to respectively to SRC-N-PE-ID 
and to DST-N-PE-ID.
The FIB records would have the VPN-Member set to VPN-ID and the U-
PE-ID fields (SRC/DST) set to the corresponding N-PE-ID (<N-PE-ID,
NULL, VPN-ID).

6.2 Auto-discovery 

The Auto-discovery protocol can be used to discover and propagate the 
following information:
   N-PE, U-PE, and VPN Membership 

The Auto-discovery protocol can be implemented using different 
protocols (ex. BGP, LDP,à)

6.3 Signaling

This section describes the LDP signaling method. Section 6.3.3
describes the BGP signaling method.

[PWE3-EThernet] defines how to carry L2 PDUs over point-to-point
MPLS LSPs, called VC LSPs. Such VC LSPs can be carried across MPLS or
GRE tunnels.

The GVPLS Signaling is based on [VPLS] and [PWE3-CTRL] signaling
and encapsulation based on [PWE3-Ethernet]. In [PWE3-CTRL]
the VC-Label bindings are distributed using the LDP DU protocol.
However, in order to support the distributed model, in GVPLS some
extensions are added to the VPLS [VPLS] scheme.

6.3.1 Access control sessions and LDP Sessions

In GVPLS, the U-PE may have one control connection per N-PE device,
regardless the number of VPLS provisioned. When the U-PE is
connected via dual homing, two control sessions may exist between
this U-PE and the two related N-PEs.

This simplifies the number of control connections that need to be
maintained by the U-PE device and the amount of information that
needs to be signaled to the other U-PE members in the VPLS space.

The N-PE devices, using LDP Extended Discovery mechanism, maintain a
full mesh of LDP sessions between them.

6.3.2 LDP VFEC/TLV

In order to create VC-LSPs between N-PE devices, a new TLV is added
to the interface parameters.

The SRC-U-PE-ID and DST-U-PE-ID are encoded as 6 bytes long, and
have SP significance.

The SRC-CW-U-PE-ID is an ID encoded for the SRC-U-PE-ID as 12 bits
long, that is unique in the scope of a given VPN-ID. This ID can be 
provisioned or generated based on algorithm that will be describe
in a subsequent version of the GVPLS. 

During the MAC learning process the SRC-ID is needed in order that a
receiver U-PE device (DST-ID) can forward the traffic in the VPLS
core. The src-cflag denotes the encoding mechanism for the source U-
PE or N-PE device that originates the packet.

The following values are possible for src-cflag to indicate the 
source U-PE device:

- VC-LABEL case: in this case the VC-Label denotes VPN-ID, SRC-ID,
and DST-ID

- Control Word (CW) case: in this case, a VC-Label denotes only the VPN-ID
and DST-ID. The SRC-ID is encoded in the CW.

6.3.3 BGP Signaling

BGP version 4 ([BGP]) can also be used as the auto-discovery and
signaling protocol for GVPLS.
In BGP, the Multi-protocol Extensions [BGP-MP] are used to carry
GVPLS signaling information.  [BGP-MP] defines the format of two BGP
attributes (MP_REACH_NLRI and MP_UNREACH_NLRI) that can be used to
announce and withdraw the announcement of reachability information.

N-PEs receiving VPN information may filter advertisements based on
the extended communities, thus controlling CE-to-CE connectivity.

The format of the GVPLS NLRI is shown in Figure below.
One or more such NLRIs can be carried in a single MP_REACH_NLRI or
MP_REACH_NLRI attribute.  Typically, the NLRI message would be
generated upon the Source MAC learning across the N-PE for a U-PE-s
model or U-PE for a U-PE-rs model.

Also, a new extended community, GVPLS-Info, is introduced to allow

6.3.4 Auto-discovery and signaling using M2P PW

For learning and distribution of the VPN Membership, it is
worthwhile to note the case when the SRC-ID of the packet is
indicated on the data plane, using the Control Word.

Adding [or removing] a VP [or VPN Member], on a given N-PE, can be
done without knowledge of the other VPs [VPN Members] on a given
VPLS. The only knowledge needed is related to the remote N-PE
devices.

Radoaca, et. al   Expires: August 2003               [Page 16]
Internet Draft    draft-radoaca-ppvpn-gvpls-01.txt    Feb 2003


For all the VP members on the same U-PE device, only one VC-Label is
generated.
When a new VP is added to a given VPLS/VPN-ID, the following values
are relevant:
- SRC-U-PE-ID
- The VC-Label associated to the SRC-U-PE_ID
- The remote N-PE devices

Using this information, the M2P LSPs can be built in the VPLS core,
using the LDP DU mechanism.

Based on the above observation, the same LDP Mapping Message can be
used to:
- Learn and distribute the VEP information to the remote N-PE and U-
PE devices.
- Create the VC-LSP

7. Data Plane

7.4.1 Access Encapsulation

In the VPLS access network, the SP address scheme (SRC-U-PE, DST-U-
PE, VPN-ID) can be implemented using different underlying protocols,
such PW [PWE3-Ethernet], MAC-in-MAC [MAC-in-MAC], or Q-in-Q [Q-in-Q].
The specification of such mapping and a signalling protocol is
out of scope of this document.

7.4.1.1 MAC-in-MAC Encapsulation

In [MAC-in-MAC] proposal, the customer packet is encapsulated with:
- DA MAC = SP's MAC Address of the destination U-PE device
- SA MAC = SP's MAC Address of the source U-PE device
- Service Header

The Source U-PE device would make a forward decision based on the
customer MAC address toward to a destination U-PE device.
The devices in the SET, between U-PE and N-PE devices, should
forward the traffic based on only the SP MAC addresses.

7.4.1.2 Q-in-Q Encapsulation

Q-in-Q encapsulation is described in [VPLS].

7.4.1.3 PW [PWE3-Ethernet] and M2P type encapsulation

In order to minimize the PWs in the access network, itÆs proposed to
use M2P PWs based on CW, as described in this document.
The LDP is needed to exchange the VC-Labels between the N-PE and U-
PE devices.




Radoaca, et. al   Expires: August 2003               [Page 17]
Internet Draft    draft-radoaca-ppvpn-gvpls-01.txt    Feb 2003

Semantic of the M2P PW:
- DST-ID is identified by the VC-LSP
- SRC-ID is identified by the CW
- VPN-ID from VC-Label
- VPN-FLG from the CW

7.4.2 VPLS Core Encapsulation

In the VPLS core, GVPLS employs the  [PWE3-Ethernet] based
encapsulation. However the Control Word may be used in order to
implement M2P PW. Also, the Control Word may be used in order to
support the MAC-in-MAC encapsulation and OAM features.

The Control Word (CW) option can be negotiated in the following way:
it can be signalled during the LDP Label advertising; if an N-PE/U-
PE does not support the CW, it can return a standard error code
defined in [LDP].

For M2P PW, if the CW is used, it must represent the SRC-ID of the
customer packet, in a given VPLS with the following format. However,
due to the fact that only 16 bits can be used, the original SRC-U-
PE-ID is encoded as 12 bits (SRC-CW-U-PE-ID), and unique in the scope
of a given VPN instance. As such SRC-U-PE-ID is identified by the 
VPN-ID/SRC-CW-U-PE-ID.

0                   1                   2                   3
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

| Rsvd  | Flags |C M            |       | SRC-CW-U-PE-ID        |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

In the above diagram the first 4 bits are reserved for future use.
They MUST be set to 0 when transmitting, and MUST be ignored upon
receipt.

The next 4 bits provide space for carrying protocol specific flags.
These are defined in the protocol-specific details below.

The next 2 bits provide the following:
- C - if set represents a continuity check for the VPN
- M - if the packet is multicast or unknown packet

The last 12 bits provide the SRC-ID indication.

7.4.3 Forwarding

The U-PE device is capable to do MAC learning and forwarding based
on the SP address scheme as such SRC-ID, DST-ID, VPN-FLG and VPN-ID.
The VPN-FLG has two bits, Continuity Check [C], and Multicast Flag
[M].

The N-PE device is doing packet forwarding by mapping the incoming
t-upl (SRC-ID, DST-ID, VPN-ID, VPN-FLG) with a specific PW (P2P, or
M2P PW).
Radoaca, et. al   Expires: August 2003               [Page 18]
Internet Draft    draft-radoaca-ppvpn-gvpls-01.txt    Feb 2003

For M2P, the SRC-ID is transported using  the SRC-CW-U-PE-ID field
in the CW and the VPN-FLG is transported  in the CW to.

7.4.4 Replication and flooding

The replication and flooding uses the PWs P2P (denoted as Multicast
PWs) that are constructed between the N-PE devices (with SRC-ID = 
SRC-N-PE-ID, DST-ID = DST-N-PE-ID).
The packets that are coming from the access side, would have a
Multicast/Unknown indication. Based on such indication the Multicast
Pws are selected.

Note
If we don't use the Multicast PWs then the replication needs to be
done per P2P PW that connected the U-PE devices. When multiple U-PE
devices are attached to the same N-PE device, than multiple customer
packets need to be sent to that N-PE - this may impact the bandwidth
in the core.

7.4.5 OAM Mechanism

The GVPLS OAM mechanism is based on the Control Word extension. The
"C" flag is set by the ingress U-PE device [or N-PE device for non-
distributed] and can be used to trigger unicast, and multicast
packets between VPs, in order to check the status of the specific
VC-LSP(s), to calculate round trip delay and other values that can
be used for SLA. For normal encapsulated  data traffic, the "C" flag
is always cleared.

The OAM without Control Word is for further study.

7.5 Considerations regarding M2P and Control Word

Using the M2P approach to build a distributed model, the following
benefits can be added to the GVPLS solution:

 - Provides optimization for learning and distributing of the
VPN Member information and the network devices. Adding and removing 
VPN Member is not related with the apriori knowledge of the other
VPN Members
 - Scalability by reducing the number of VC-LSPs and VC-Labels
    by an order of magnitude

- Allows setting a simple mechanism for OAM continuity checking
    of VC-LSPs, between VPN Members

8. Deployment Scenarios

8.1 Interoperability between GVPLS and VPLS solutions

In the same network or in the same PE, GVPLS and VPLS [VPLS] 
solutions may be deployed and inter-work together. This allows a SP 
to scale a network in incremental way, and to allow different types
of U-PE devices to be deployed in different access networks in a
transparent manner.

The basic assumption is that GVPLS and [VPLS] would use the same Vpls
VC-LSPs full mesh configuration, without Control Word. The VPLS N-PE
sees the VSI as a Virtual Bridge and vice versa.

In the data plane, VPLS don't use the CW as Source indication. The
Source Indication is generated from the VC-Label.

In order to accommodate this, the GVPLS N-PE node will generate for
one DST-ID, a set of "N" remote VC-Labels.

Let's suppose a GVPLS topology, with "n" U-PE(s), that are VPLS
aware. Also, let's suppose an VPLS access network with  "m" U-PEs
that are Layer 2 aggregation devices.

In this scenario, the VPLS would see the GVPLS topology as an "n" set

of VSIs. Neither is the VPLS aware that it is talking with a GVPLS
topology nor is the GVPLS aware about VPLS.

9. VPLS Resiliency

The GVPLS model allows greater flexibility in building resiliency
between U-PE and N-PE devices. When a U-PE device is connected to a
single N-PE device using multiple physical links, standard link
aggregation and load-distribution techniques can be used between the
two devices. The load-distribution should be done in such a way so
as to avoid packet reordering and duplicate packets within a VPLS
instance. The exact algorithm for load-balancing between U-PE and N-
PE is really a matter of local decision.

When a U-PE device is dual-homed to two different N-PE devices, only
one of the N-PE devices should be elected as the primary for any
particular VPLS. This is so as to avoid duplicate multicast packets
being transmitted to the dual-homed U-PE device. It must be ensured
that no packet-reordering or duplicate multicast packets are sent in
steady-state and in any failure recovery scenario.

Since the GVPLS model defines a SP addressing scheme to identify
individual U-PE devices (and their ports if the U-PE device is not
bridge-capable), this information can be exchanged between a dual-
homed U-PE and its N-PEs a priori, i.e. before a failure happens.



Radoaca, et. al   Expires: August 2003               [Page 20]
Internet Draft    draft-radoaca-ppvpn-gvpls-01.txt    Feb 2003

When a failure happens, the N-PEs can intelligently perform failure
recovery in the access networks as they can independently identify
the dual-homed U-PE device using the SP addressing scheme. The exact
mechanisms for failure detection and recovery will be described
further in future.


10. Security Considerations

Security issues resulting from this draft will be discussed in
greater depth at a later point.  It is recommended in [RFC3036] that
LDP authentication methods be applied.  This would
prevent unauthorized participation by a PE in a VPLS.  Traffic
separation for a VPLS is effected by using VC labels.  However, for
additional levels of security, the customer MAY deploy end-to-end
security, which is out of the scope of this draft.


11. Compliance with the PPVN Requirements

The GVPLS solution is compliant with most of the requirements. However,
the design was chosen in order to allow a large deployments of VPNs, while
maintaining the PE peformance and security constant.
