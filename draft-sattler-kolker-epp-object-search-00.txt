Internet-Draft               EPP Object Search             December 2021

1.  Introduction

   The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP), as defined in [RFC5730],
   is a protocol whose original motivation is to provide a standard
   Internet domain name registration protocol for use between registries
   and registrars.
   
   Registrars can transform EPP objects either with <create>, <delete>,
   <renew>, <transfer>, or <update> according to [RFC5730]. They are
   usually responsible for maintaining their inventory themselves.
   
   Due to various reasons, such as consolidation of registrars,
   migrations, development of new management systems, etc., it may
   happen that a registrar has lost track of its inventory.
   
   EPP already provides query capabilities with <check> and <info>, but
   those are limited to looking up exact strings. Therefore, it is
   desirable to implement a search functionality via EPP to find any
   forgotten or orphaned objects.

   This document describes an extension mapping for version 1.0 of the
   EPP to provide a mechanism by which EPP clients can search and list
   EPP objects stored by EPP servers.

1.1.  Terminology and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   XML [W3C.REC-xml11-20060816] is case-sensitive. Unless stated
   otherwise, XML specification and examples provided in this document
   MUST be interpreted in the character case presented in order to
   develop a conforming implementation.

   "object-search" is used as an abbreviation for "urn:ietf:params:xml:
   ns:epp:object-search-0.1". The XML namespace prefix "object-search"
   is used, but implementations MUST NOT depend on it. Instead, they are
   to employ a proper namespace-aware XML parser and serializer to
   interpret and output the XML documents.
   
   In examples, "C:" represents lines sent by a protocol client, and
   "S:" represents lines returned by a protocol server. Indentation and
   white space in examples are provided only to illustrate element
   relationships and are not a required feature of this protocol.

2.  Migrating to Newer Versions of This Extension

   Servers that implement this extension SHOULD provide a way for
   clients to progressively update their implementations when a new
   version of the extension is deployed.  A newer version of the
   extension is expected to use an XML namespace with a higher version
   number than the prior versions.
   
   Servers SHOULD (for a temporary migration period up to server policy)
   provide support for older versions of the extension in parallel to
   the newest version and allow clients to execute their preferred
   version of the <info> command based on the object search <objURI>
   elements of the server <greeting>. The version of the object search
   <info> response MUST match the version of the object search <info>
   command executed by the server.

3.  Object Attributes

3.1.  Object Search Elements
   
   The minimum character for a search pattern and the the limit for the
   search results is up to server policy.

   <object-search:domain>
     The search pattern for the domain object; the attribute "type" is
     REQUIRED and MUST either be "name", "contact", "host", "status",
     "crDate", "upDate", "exDate", or "trDate". The attribute "filter"
     REQUIRED and MUST be present to identify the filter and MUST either
     be "exact", "begins", "ends", or "contains".
   
   <object-search:host>
     The search pattern for the host object; the attribute "type" is
     REQUIRED and MUST either be "name", "ipv4", or "ipv6". The
     attribute "filter" is REQUIRED and MUST be present to identify the
     filter and MUST either be "exact", "begins", "ends", or "contains".

   <object-search:contact>
     The search pattern for the contact object; the attribute "type" is
     REQUIRED and MUST either be "id", "name", "orga", "street", "city",
     "state", "postcode", "email", "voice", "fax", or "country". The
     attribute "filter" is REQUIRED and MUST be present to identify the
     filter and MUST either be "exact", "begins", "ends", or "contains".

4.  EPP Command Mapping

   A detailed description of the EPP syntax and semantics can be found
   in the EPP core protocol specification [RFC5730]. The command
   mappings described here are specifically used to search for objects
   and object mapping.

4.1.  EPP Query Commands

   EPP [RFC5730] provides four commands to retrieve object information:
   <check> to determine if an object is known to the server, <info> to
   retrieve detailed information associated with an object, <poll> to
   discover and retrieve service messages, and <transfer> to retrieve
   object transfer status information.
   
   This extension does not add any elements to EPP <check>, <poll>, and
   <transfer> commands or responses.

4.1.1.  EPP <info> Command

   EPP provides the <info> command that is used to looking up objects.
   In addition to the standard EPP command elements, the <info> command
   MUST contain a <object-search:info> element that allows objects to be
   searched.
   
   The <object-search:info> element MUST contain a child element. It is
   either the <object-search:domain> child element, described in Section
   4.1.1.1, to search domains, the <object-search:contact> child
   element, described in Section 4.1.1.2, to search contacts, or the
   <object-search:host> child element, described in Section 4.1.1.3, to
   search hosts.

4.1.1.1.  Object Search Domains

   A search for domain objects can be performed by using the <info>
   command with the <object-search> element and the
   <object-search:domain> child element, defined in Section 3.1.

   Example to search for a domain object in an <info> command.
   
   C:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
   C:<epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
   C:  <command>
   C:    <info>
   C:      <object-search:info xmlns:object-search=
   C:        "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp:object-search-0.1">
   C:        <object-search:domain type="name" filter="begins">example
   C:        </object-search:domain>
   C:      </object-search:info>
   C:    </info>
   C:    <clTRID>ABC-12345</clTRID>
   C:  </command>
   C:</epp>

Internet-Draft               EPP Object Search             December 2021

   When an <info> command has been processed successfully, the EPP
   <resData> element MUST contain a child <object-search:infData>
   element that identifies the object search namespace. The
   <object-search:infData> element contains the <object-search:list>
   element with zero or more <object-search:item> child elements. The
   "total" attribute is REQUIRED and MUST contain the total number of
   the search result. This allows the client to determine if the search
   needs to be refined if the number is too large. The
   <object-search:item> element contains <object-search:domain> child
   elements defined in Section 3.1.

   Example of returning the list of object search items in an <info>
   response.

4.1.1.2. Object Search Contacts

   A search for contact objects can be performed by using the <info>
   command with the <object-search> element and the
   <object-search:contact> child element, defined in Section 3.1.

   Example to search for a contact object in an <info> command.

   C:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
   C:<epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
   C:  <command>
   C:    <info>
   C:      <object-search:info xmlns:object-search=
   C:        "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp:object-search-0.1">
   C:        <object-search:contact type="name" filter="contains">John
   C:        </object-search:contact>
   C:      </object-search:info>
   C:    </info>
   C:    <clTRID>ABC-12346</clTRID>
   C:  </command>
   C:</epp>

   When an <info> command has been processed successfully, the EPP
   <resData> element MUST contain a child <object-search:infData>
   element that identifies the object search namespace. The
   <object-search:infData> element contains the <object-search:list>
   element with zero or more <object-search:item> child elements. The
   "total" attribute is REQUIRED and MUST contain the total number of
   the search result. This allows the client to determine if the search
   needs to be refined if the number is too large. The
   <object-search:item> element contains the <object-search:contact>
   child element defined in Section 3.1.

4.2.  EPP Transform Commands

   EPP provides five commands to transform objects: <create> to create
   an instance of an object, <delete> to delete an instance of an
   object, <renew> to extend the validity period of an object,
   <transfer> to manage object sponsorship changes, and <update> to
   change information associated with an object.
   
   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <create>,
   <delete>, <renew>, <transfer>, and <update>.

5.  Formal Syntax

   The EPP Object Search schema is presented here.
   
   The formal syntax presented here is a complete schema representation
   of the object mapping suitable for automated validation of EPP XML
   instances. The  <CODE BEGINS> and <CODE ENDS> tags are not part of
   the schema; they are used to note the beginning and end of the
   schema for URI registration purposes.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  XML Namespace

   This document uses URNs to describe XML namespaces and XML schemas
   conforming to a registry mechanism defined in [RFC3688].

   Registration request for the object search namespace:
      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp:object-search-0.1
      Registrant Contact: IESG
      XML: None.  Namespace URIs do not represent an XML specification.

   Registration request for the object search schema:
      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:epp:object-search-0.1
      Registrant Contact: IESG
      XML: See the "Formal Syntax" section of this document.

6.2.  EPP Extension Registry

   The following registration of the EPP Extension Registry, described
   in [RFC7451], is requested:

   Name of Extension: Object Search for the Extensible Provisioning
   Protocol (EPP)
   Document status: Standards Track
   Reference: (insert the reference to RFC version of this document)
   Registrant Name and Email Address: IESG <iesg@ietf.org>
   TLDs: Any
   IPR Disclosure: None
   Status: Active
   Notes: None

7.  Security Considerations

   The mapping extensions described in this document do not provide any
   security services beyond those described by EPP [RFC5730] and
   protocol layers used by EPP.  The security considerations described
   in these other specifications apply to this specification as well.

8.  Implementation Status

   Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section and the reference to
   [RFC7942] before publication.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature. It
   is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".
