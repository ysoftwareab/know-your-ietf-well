               Abstract 
                   
                  The most common user applications for data communication (including 
                  web browsing and e-mail) lack a method for name resolution in multi-
                  hop wireless ad-hoc networks of mobile nodes (MANETs). While the 
                  Domain Name System (DNS) works well on the fixed Internet, it 
                  represents a centralized approach to name resolution, which is not 
                  suitable for MANETs. This document specifies a straightforward 
                  solution for name resolution in on-demand MANETs, i.e. MANETs that 
                  are routed with a reactive routing protocol, such as DSR [DSR] or 
                  AODV [AODV]. Names that are resolved locally within the MANET will 
                  normally have preference. However, MANET nodes that have access to 
                  external networks may complement the local name resolution by 
                  injecting into the MANET addresses resolved by a conventional DNS 
                  server. The proposed solution applies equally well to IPv4 or IPv6.

               1 Introduction 
                   
                  When a user wants to communicate with an external resource, it 
                  normally prefers to identify the resource with a name (e.g. 
                  'www.ietf.org') rather than with an IP address. Names are easier to 
                  remember, while 32-bits or 128-bits IP-addresses are normally 
                  unknown to the user. Hence, the user will not be able to communicate 
                  with the resource unless an application helps resolving the name to 
                  a corresponding IP-address. Without a name resolution method for 
                  Mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) in place, MANET users cannot easily 
                  use applications that are developed for fixed networks for local 
                  communication. 
                   
                  Normally a DNS Resolver looks up a requested name and retrieves an 
                  IP-address on behalf of the user ([RFC1034], [RFC1035]). The 
                  application would then subsequently contact  the counterpart 
                  directly, using the obtained IP-address. DNS takes a centralized 
                  hierarchical approach to name resolution, and is designed with the 
                  fixed Internet in mind.  
                   
                  A centralized approach is not very suitable for name resolution on 
                  MANETs. Since MANETs lack infrastructure, some means (e.g. an 
                  election algorithm) would be required to ensure that there is always 
                  at least on name server present on the network, storing name-to-
                  address mappings of the other MANET nodes. Furthermore, MANETs are 
                  dynamic and often exhibit non-deterministic ad-hoc behavior. With a 
                  centralized approach, MANET nodes would have no means to resolve 
                  names if the centralized name server moves out of reach of the 
                  MANET. Instead, MANETs call for a distributed approach to local name 
                  resolution.

                                       Ad-hoc Name Resolution           February 2003 
                
                  The presented scheme for name resolution in on-demand MANETs applies 
                  equally well to IPv4 or IPv6. It is mainly targeted at users that 
                  can supply their MANET node with a Fully Qualified Domain Name 
                  (FQDN) from the globally unique DNS name space. The user may have 
                  control over some part of the DNS name space or may have received 
                  the FQDN from an organization that they belong to or subscribe to. A 
                  MANET node might as well use a non-unique name from the '.local.' 
                  domain [M-DNS] (for example in combination with an auto-configured 
                  link-local IPv4 address ([v4LL], [MANETv4LL]) or with a MANET-local 
                  IPv6 address. However, that might require a method to resolve 
                  potential naming conflicts, which is beyond the scope of this draft.  
                   
                  MANETs might be connected to external networks through Internet 
                  Gateways (IGWs). An IGW is a MANET router, which also is a host or a 
                  router on an external network (with Internet connectivity). The IGW 
                  may have access to a conventional DNS server over the external 
                  network and it MAY also provide other MANET nodes with access to the 
                  external network. This draft does not assume any particular 
                  mechanism for the latter, since this is an issue still under 
                  development (e.g. [Globalv4] and [Globalv6]). 
                   
                  Since IGWs may have access to a conventional DNS servers over the 
                  external network, the name resolution protocol for MANETs should 
                  interoperate with DNS so that it can resolve both local names and 
                  names from the conventional DNS system simultaneously.  
                   
                   
               2 Terminology 
                   
                  This document borrows terminology from [AODV] and [DSR]. In 
                  addition: 
                   
                  Route Request (RREQ)  
                       
                     A RREQ is a routing message that an originator broadcasts to 
                     discover a route to a destination node. RREQ allows the 
                     destination to discover a reverse path to the originator. 
                   
                  Route Reply (RREP)  
                       
                     A RREP is a routing message that a destination node or an 
                     intermediate node unicasts back to the source node in reply to a 
                     RREQ. RREP allows the source to discover a forward path to the 
                     destination. 
                   
                  Name-to-Address Request (NREQ)  
                       
                     A NREQ is a name resolution request that is always carried as an 
                     extension to a RREQ. For AODV this extension will be in a Type-
                     Length-Value format:

                     By using a RREQ header a reverse unicast route back to the 
                     originator is already in place for nodes that can respond to the 
                     NREQ. (Total bandwidth overhead is reduced since a route has 
                     already been established.

                     A NREP is a name resolution reply that is always carried as an 
                     extension to a RREP. For AODV this extension will be in a Type-

                     By using a RREP header a forward unicast route from the 
                     originator to the node that resolved the IP address is already in 
                     place for subsequent communication. 
                   
                  Originator 
                       
                     In a discovery process the originator is the MANET node that 
                     broadcasts the RREQ (with or without an NREQ).

                     This is a (possibly mobile) MANET router, which also is a host or 
                     a router on an external network with Internet connectivity. The 
                     IGW may have access to a conventional DNS server over the 
                     external network and it may provide other MANET nodes with access 
                     to the external network. This draft does not assume any 
                     particular mechanism for the latter, since this is an issue still 
                     under development (e.g. [Globalv4] and [Globalv6]). 
                   
                   
               3 Assumptions 
                   
                  This document assumes that RREQ and RREP messages of the reactive

                  The current version of this draft will only address Êname-to-

                  queries) might be specified in a later version if deemed necessary.

               4.1 On-Demand Routing Protocols 
                   
                  The proposed scheme for name resolution is designed for on-demand 
                  MANETs (i.e. MANETs routed by a reactive routing protocol, such as 
                  AODV [AODV] or DSR [DSR]) where route detection is performed as 
                  follows: A source node broadcasts/floods a RREQ containing the IP 
                  address of the requested destination node. If the RREQ reaches the 
                  node that is identified by the destination IP address (or an 
                  intermediate node with a valid route to the destination), that node 
                  responds with a RREP. Since the RREQ formed a reverse route, the 
                  RREP can be unicasted back to the originator. The RREP will form a 
                  forward route that allows the originator to unicast subsequent IP 
                  packets to the destination. 
                   
               4.2 Name Resolution Requests and Replies 
                   
                  On a dynamic MANET, name resolution cannot rely on only one 
                  centralized name server. Instead a Name-to-Address Request (NREQ) 
                  should be broadcasted throughout the MANET. Each MANET node with a 
                  discoverable name MUST process the request, as it is flooded 
                  throughout the network.   
                   
                  To reduce the number of broadcasts required for name resolution, the 
                  NREQ is carried as an extension to an RREQ. Hence, a return unicast 
                  route to the originator of the request is already in place for a 
                  node that wants to respond to the NREQ. If the NREQ were not carried 
                  by a RREQ message, the responding node would have to issue an 
                  additional broadcast to discover the route back to the originating 
                  node. 
                   
                  The destination IP address contained in the RREQ, which indicates 
                  which address is searched for, MUST be set to a pre-defined value, 
                  NAME-RESOLUTION-ADDRESS. This can be a zero-address, a broadcast 
                  address or a pre-assigned multicast-address to which no node can 
                  cache a route. Hence, intermediate nodes without a valid address 
                  mapping for the requested name MUST NOT respond to the RREQ. When 
                  the NAME-RESOLUTION-ADDRESS is being used, additional unicast-
                  specific properties of the reactive routing protocol might also be 
                  turned off (e.g. for AODV the destination sequence number must be 
                  set to unknown).  
                   
                  The Name-to-Address Reply (NREP) is carried as an extension to a 
                  RREP message. The sender of the NREP will normally include its own 
                  IP address as destination IP address in the RREP message to ensure

                  that a forward route is formed. In many instances the node that 
                  responds to the NREQ is the node identified with the name that is 
                  searched for. By carrying the response in an RREP message, it can 
                  supply the originator with both the resolved IP address and a 
                  unicast route to that IP-address. Hence, the originator does not 
                  have to issue an additional broadcast to discover a route to the 
                  resolved address when it subsequently tries to contact that address. 
                   
                  Each MANET node with a discoverable name SHOULD respond to an NREQ 
                  message with the discoverable name in the Name field. Furthermore, 
                  other MANET nodes, except for IGWs, which is not identified with the 
                  name requested for in the Name field, MUST NOT respond to the NREQ. 
                   
                  This fully distributed approach may later be enhanced with caching-
                  mechanisms. Since the benefits of intermediate-node caching are 
                  unclear, this is left for further research (Section 6). 
                   
               4.3 Interaction with External Networks 
                   
                  When an Internet Gateway (IGW) receives an NREQ it SHOULD try to 
                  resolve the requested name by a conventional DNS server through the 
                  external network to which it is connected. After having successfully 
                  resolved the name, it returns to the originator an NREP containing 
                  the resolved IP address(es), thus acting as a DNS proxy. 
                   
                  If DNS resolves a name into a number of different IP-addresses, the 
                  IGW MUST prioritize IP-addresses that are assumed to be present on 
                  the MANET (e.g. if the IGW has cached a valid route to that 
                  address).  
                   
                  The presented mechanism for name resolution on MANETs does not 
                  hinder a node to also acquire an IP-address of a conventional DNS 
                  server on an external network (by some means that are beyond the 
                  scope of the current version of this draft). This node MAY try to 
                  resolve a name on this server if name resolution locally on the 
                  MANET fails. However, many nodes might not have straightforward 
                  access to an external network, and may therefore not be able to 
                  utilize this option. It is thus assumed that using an IGW as a DNS-
                  proxy will be sufficient in most scenarios. The details of how to 
                  ensure global connectivity are beyond the scope of this document, 
                  and the reader is referred to [Globalv4] and [Globalv6] for proposed 
                  solutions.  
                   
               4.4 Response Selection 
                   
                  The proposed scheme resembles multicast DNS [M-DNS] in that an 
                  originator of a NREQ might receive a number of NREPs from different 
                  responders. Hence, the originator should wait for NREP-COLLECTION-
                  INTERVAL milliseconds to collect responses that might arrive. 
                   
                  If the originator receives an NREP where the resolved IP address is 
                  equal to the destination IP address of the RREP header, it MUST 
                  assume that the address was resolved locally. On the contrary, if 
                  the originator receives an NREP where the resolved IP address is not 
                
               P. Engelstad             Expires August 2003                 [Page 6] 
                                       Ad-hoc Name Resolution           February 2003 
                
                  equal to the destination IP address of the RREP header, it SHOULD 
                  assume that the address was resolved by an IGW over an external 
                  network. 
                   
                  The detailed procedures for handling multiple responses and 
                  selecting a resolved IP address is implementation-specific and 
                  outside the scope of this document. However, if the originator 
                  receives responses from both the external DNS system and locally, it 
                  SHOULD prioritize responses arriving from the local MANET. Hence, a 
                  direct route through the MANET will have preference compared to a 
                  route that goes through external networks. Furthermore, a local 
                  response might be more reliable since the MANET node identified with 
                  the resolved name might not have had a chance to update its DNS 
                  server (e.g. by [DNS-UPDATE]) after having entered the MANET. 
                   
                   
               4.5 Duplicate Response Suppression 
                   
                  A node that has responded to a NREQ, might receive a new NREQ for 
                  the same name and from the same originator several times in a row. 
                  The reason might be that the first NREP message got lost, and never 
                  reached the originator. Hence, the responder will have to respond to 
                  the NREQ again to ensure that the originator receives the reply. 
                   
                  However, the reason for receiving the same NREQ over and over again 
                  might also be that the originator is not satisfied with the 
                  response. If the originator for example receives a DNS mapping for 
                  an IP address on external networks, but has no means to ensure 
                  global connectivity, the response might not be very useful, and the 
                  originator might continue the expanded ring search for a local 
                  response. In such cases, a responder should not be allowed to 
                  respond to each NREQ issued. 
                   
                  In conclusion, the responder SHOULD NOT respond to the same Name-to-
                  Address request (originating from the same IP source address) more 
                  than MAX-REPEATED-NREPS times within a timeframe of NREP-REPEAT-
                  TIMEFRAME milliseconds. This mechanism allows some RREPs being lost 
                  in the network while unnecessary duplicate responses are being 
                  suppressed.

                  thereby increase service availability. However, massive pro-active 
                  synchronization between name server and surrounding nodes seems to 
                  go bad together with MANET scenarios that call for reactive routing. 
                  Bad synchronization, on the other hand, may lead to a substantial 
                  amount of false positive and false negative name resolution lookups. 
                   
                  A milder form of caching is to allow intermediate nodes cache Name-
                  to-Address mappings appearing in NREP messages that are forwarded by 
                  the node. If receiving an NREQ message for which it has cached a 
                  mapping and a valid route to the resolved IP address, the 
                  intermediate node would return a NREP message to the source node 
                  containing the resolved IP address. If an IGW has cached a mapping, 
                  it should return an NREP based on this mapping, and it should not 
                  attempt to resolve the name over the external network.  
                   
                  The message formats of the NREP extensions are designed to allow for 
                  a caching mechanism to be defined in the future, since they contain 
                  not only resolved IP-addresses but also the requested name. The use 
                  of such caching, however, is NOT RECOMMENDED by the current version 
                  of this draft: The benefits of such caching are unclear, and it is 
                  an issue that calls for further research. 
                   
               7.2 Address-to-Name Lookups (Reverse DNS Queries) 
                   
                  If deemed necessary, the current document may later be extended to 
                  also allow for 'address-to-name' lookups. 
                   
                   
               8 Security Considerations 
                   
                  This document does not provide a mechanism to secure the integrity 
                  of name resolution messages. The reactive routing protocol should 
                  have means to ensure integrity of the routing path between source 
                  and destination. The integrity of the proposed name resolution

                  scheme should probably be protected by the same mechanism, since 
                  name resolution is communicated entirely by means of extensions to 
                  routing protocol messages.
