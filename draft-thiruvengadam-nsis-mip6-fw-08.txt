Abstract

   Most of the firewalls deployed today are Mobile IPv6 unaware.
   Widespread Mobile IPv6 deployment is not possible unless Mobile IPv6
   messages can pass through these firewalls.  One approach is to use a
   signaling protocol to communicate with these firewalls and instruct
   them to bypass these Mobile IPv6 messages.  The goal of this document
   is to describe the interaction between NSIS and Mobile IPv6 for
   enabling Mobile IPv6 traversal.

1.  Introduction

   Route optimization, an integral part of Mobile IPv6 specification
   does not work with state of the art firewalls that employ stateful
   packet filtering (SPF).  This problem is well described in [1].  The
   other mode of communication in Mobile IPv6, namely bi-directional
   tunneling, also do not work under some firewall placements.  Apart
   from this, the Mobile IPv6 binding updates (encapsulated using IPsec
   ESP) packets also have problems with firewall traversal.  To tackle
   these issues, one approach is to utilize a signaling protocol to
   install some firewall rules for allowing these Mobile IPv6 messages
   to pass through.  The NSIS NAT/FW NSLP, as described in [2], allows
   to establish, maintain and delete middlebox state (i.e., NAT bindings
   and Firewall rules), and allow packets to traverse these boxes.  This
   protocol thus provides a possible way to address the aforementioned
   problem.  This document describe the considerations of NSIS NAT/FW
   NSLP, especially the involved messages and necessary firewall rules,
   when firewalls are encountered in a Mobile IPv6 network.  More
   specifically, the following basic scenarios are studied individually.

   o  Mobile Node (MN) behind a firewall;

   o  Correspondent Node (CN) behind a firewall;

   o  Home Agent (HA) behind a firewall.

   For every scenario, we will discuss how to apply NSIS signaling for
   the routing modes.  It has to be noted that a real scenario could
   include a combination of some set of these cases.  In any case, we
   assume that the MN, the CN, the HA and the Firewalls (FWs) are NSIS
   and NAT/FW NSLP aware.  Also note that for every NSIS message, the
   underlying GIST[5] level provides flow-id information which will be
   used to install the firewall policies.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [3].

   Furthermore, we use the same terminology as in [4], [2], and [6].
   Apart from this, we use some abbreviations to describe the flow-id of
   the NSIS messages:

   o  SA-Source Address,

   o  DA-Destination Address,

   o  SP-Source Port,

   o  DP-Destination Port, and

   o  an asterisk is used as wild-card.

   The term 'DS' refers to data sender and the term 'DR' to data
   receiver.

3.  Mobile node behind a firewall

   In Figure 1, the MN is protected by a firewall that employs stateful
   packet filtering (SPF).  The external CN and the HA are also shown in
   the figure.  The MN is located in a visited network and is expecting
   to communicate with the CN.  If the MN initiated normal data traffic
   there is no problem with the SPF firewall, as the communication is
   initiated from internal.

3.1.  Binding updates

   IPsec protected Binding Updates cause problems in some deployment
   environments, as described in [1].  As a solution, NAT/FW NSLP can be
   used to dynamically configure the firewall(s) to allow the IPsec
   packets and associated traffic like IKE/IKEv2 packets to traverse,
   before sending the binding updates.  Therefore, IP Protocol ID 50
   should be allowed in the filter policies in order to allow IPsec ESP
   and IP Protocol ID 51 to allow IPsec AH.  The firewall should also
   allow IKE packets (to UDP port 500) to bypass.  As the firewall is a
   SPF, the subsequent Binding Acknowledgement from the HA to the CoA
   can pass the firewall, as it matches an existing state inside the
   firewall.

      For the BU message (IPsec ESP in transport mode) from MN to HA,
      the MN installs rules using CREATE for the flow-id: SA: CoA, DA:
      HA, SPIx.

3.2.  Route optimization

   Immediately after moving into a new network, the MN acquires a new
   CoA, performs the pinhole creation as described in section
   Section 3.1 and runs the Binding Update to the HA.  The HoTI message

   from the MN is IPsec encapsulated in tunnel mode and as it does not
   belong to the session initiated by the MN or match a previously
   installed rule, it will be dropped by the firewall.  Using CREATE,
   the MN initiates NSIS signalling to the firewall and open pinholes
   for the HoTI message.  The message flow is shown in Figure 2.  The
   HoT message can re-use this pinhole and is able to reach the MN.

      For the HoTI message (IPsec ESP in tunnel mode) from MN to HA, the
      MN installs rules using the CREATE message for the flow-id: SA:
      CoA, DA:HA, SPIx.

   The CoTI message and the CoT message can traverse the MN's ASP-
   firewall, as the CoTI message is not IPsec encapsulated and the CoT
   message correspond to the state previously installed by the CoTI
   message.  Once the RRT is successful, the binding update message is
   sent to the CN.  If the MN wants to continue sending data traffic, no
   NSIS signaling is needed at all for this scenario.  However, if the
   CN wants to send data traffic and the rules installed before matching
   again the addresses, the ports and the IPsec encapsulation, the

   relevant packet filter rules have to be installed at the firewall.
   If the rules installed before only matching again source and
   destination address, the data traffic exchanged with the CN in RO-
   case can also traverse the firewall with no need of installing
   additional rules.  However, that would allow all kind of traffic from
   the CN and is rejected.  Hence, the MN has to initiate sending data
   traffic to the CN but this happens after the RRT.

      For the data traffic from CN to MN the MN installs rules using EXT
      for the flow-id: SA: CN, DA:CoA, SP: data application port, DP:
      data application port.

3.3.  Bi-directional tunneling

   Consider the scenario where the MN is protected by a SPF.  Even
   though the MN had earlier initiated a connection for the purpose of
   binding update, new filter rules have to be installed to allow the
   tunnelled data traffic as the rules before installed rules match
   again the addresses, the ports and the IPsec ESP encapsulation.  The
   message flow is shown in Figure 3.  If the MN is the DS, no signaling
   is needed at all.  Otherwise, the MN open pinholes to let the data
   messages traverse, with the help of EXT.

      For the data traffic from HA to MN, the MN installs rules using
      EXT for the flow-id: SA: HA, DA: CoA.  Note these data messages
      for which we do signaling, are IP- in-IP tunneled messages.

3.4.  Change of Firewalls

   If the MN roams and attaches to a different firewall, the above-
   mentioned routing methods will have problems in traversing the new
   firewall.  In this case the data sender (where it is MN or the CN or
   the HA) should re-signaling to the firewall using NSIS and establish
   the policies accordingly (mentioned above according to the routing
   methods).

   Since the NAT/FW NSLP rely on a soft-state approach, established
   sessions will be automatically be teardown after a specified timeout
   value.  Thus it is not necessary to delete or teardown a session
   after an MN roams to another network, as the protocol will do this by
   it own.  More discussions about a possible alternative way by tearing
   down the established state are given in [7].

3.5.  Operations when MN is behind a firewall

   In summary, when a firewall is located in MN's ASP, the MN configures
   the firewall(s) using CREATE to let following messages traverse:

   MN configures the firewall(s) using EXT to let following traverse:

4.1.  Route Optimization

   In Figure 4, the CN is protected by a firewall that employs stateful
   packet filtering.  The external MN and its associated HA are also
   shown in the figure.  The MN communicates with the CN.  If the CN
   initiated normal data traffic there is no problem with the SPF, as
   the communication is initiated from internal.

   The MN moves out of its home network and has to perform the return
   routability test before sending the binding update to the CN.  It
   sends a HoTI message through the HA to the CN and expects a HoT
   message from the CN along the same path.  It also sends a CoTI
   message directly to the CN and expects CoT message in the same path
   from the CN.  The SPF will only allow packets that belong to an
   existing session and hence both the packets (HoTI, CoTI) will be
   dropped as these packets are Mobile IPv6 packets and these packets
   have a different header structure.  The existing rules at the
   firewall might have been installed for some kind of data traffic.

                     Figure 5: CN behind the firewall

   As the RRT procedure cannot be executed, the firewall rules have to
   be modified to allow these MIPv6 messages to go through.  The MN
   initiates the NSIS session by sending a CREATE message to the CN to
   install rules for the CoTI message.  The NSIS signaling to allow the
   CoTI message is shown in Figure 5.

      For the CoTI message from MN to CN, the MN installs rules using
      CREATE for the flow-id: SA: CoA, DA: CN.

   This allows the CoTI to reach the CN.  If the MN signal as described
   in section Section 3.2 the HoTI is able to reach the HA.
   Nevertheless, the HoTI message from the HA to the CN is not able to
   traverse, as it does not match any state at the CN's ASP-FW.
   Therefore, either the HA or the CN has to signal install rules to let
   the HoTI traverse.

      If the HA initiates the pinhole creation, the CREATE message for
      the HoTI message from HA to CN the flow-id will be: SA: HoA, DA:
      CN.

      If the CN initiates the pinhole creation, the EXT message for the
      HoTI message from HA to CN the flow-id will be: SA: HoA, DA: CN.

   When the MN receives both CoT and HoT messages, it performs binding
   update to the CN which is possible, as the BU can re-uses the

   previously installed rules.  Note that the aforementioned signalling
   was only to allow the Mobile IPv6 messages.

   If the CN wants to continue sending data traffic (CN is the DS) to
   the new CoA, it can do so without any additional signaling.  This is
   because the SPF will allow the traffic initiated by the nodes that it
   protects.  But if the MN wants to continue sending data traffic (MN
   is the DS), it has to install filter rules for data traffic.  The
   prospect of combined signaling (for control and data traffic) could
   be useful, but currently the NSIS NAT/FW protocol does not support
   installing multiple rules at the same time.

      For the data traffic from MN to CN, the MN installs rules using
      CREATE for the flow-id: SA: CoA, DA:CN, SP: data application port,
      DP: data application port.

   This solution works with the assumption that the firewalls will allow
   NSIS messages from external network to bypass with delayed packet
   filter state establishment and authorization from the CN.  However,
   operators might be reluctant to allow NSIS message from external
   network as this might lead to DoS attacks.  The CN might therefore be
   required to authorize the traversal of NSIS signaling message
   implicitly to reduce unwanted traffic.

   To avoid this, it is also possible to ask the CN to open pinholes in
   the firewall on behalf of the MN.  But this solution will not work in
   some scenarios due to routing asymmetry as explained in [2].

4.2.  Bi-directional Tunneling

   If the CN is protected by a SPF firewall, there is no need for any
   signaling if the CN starts sending data traffic.  The CN sends the
   data traffic and hence the SPF will store relevant state information
   and accepts packets from the reverse direction.

   If the HA is the DS, then either the CN has to initiate the signaling
   using EXT or the HA using CREATE, in order to configure the firewall
   to allow the data traffic traverse from the HA to CN.  The message
   flow if the CN should signal for this pinhole is shown in Figure 6.

      If the CN initiates the pinhole creation, the EXT message for the
      data traffic from HA to CN the flow-id will be: SA: HA, DA: CN,
      SP: data application port, DP: data application port.

      If the HA initiates the pinhole creation, the CREATE message for
      the data traffic from HA to CN the flow-id will be: SA: HA, DA:
      CN, SP: data application port, DP: data application port.

4.3.  Change of Firewalls

   If the MN roams and attaches to a network with a different firewall,
   the Mobile IPv6 protocol will be problematic again while traversing
   the newly encountered firewall, as the firewall is not configured
   appropriately.  In this case the data sender (either the MN or the CN
   for both Mobile IPv6 signalling and data traffic, or the HA in case
   of Mobile IPv6 signaling traffic) should re-signal to the firewall
   using NSIS and establish the policies accordingly (following the
   similar procedures as described before).  One possible enhancement
   would be to use the context transfer protocol between the old and new
   firewalls upon proper authorization of the operation; however this

   approach will require further study.

4.4.  Operations when CN is behind a firewall

   In summary, when a firewall is located in the CN's ASP, MN configures
   the firewall(s) using CREATE to let following messages traverse:

   o  CoTI messages (src: CoA, dst: CN) {RO}

   o  for data traffic from MN to CN and vice versa (src: CoA, dst: CN)
      {for RO}

   The HA configures the firewall(s) using CREATE to let following
   messages traverse:

   o  HoTI messages (src: HoA, dst: CN) {for RO}

   o  for data traffic from HA to CN (src: HA, dst: CN) {for BT}

   CN configure the firewall(s) using EXT to let following traverse:

   o  for data traffic from HA to CN (src: HA, dst: CN) {for BT}

   o  for data traffic from HA to CN (src: HA, dst: CN) {for BT}

5.1.  Route Optimization

   In Figure 7, the Mobile Node's MSP is protected by a firewall that
   employs the stateful packet filtering.  The MN and the CN are also
   shown in the figure.  The MN, after entering a new network, sends a
   Binding Update to the HA.  But as it is initiated by the MN, it first
   has to install some filter rules in the firewall before sending the
   Binding Update.

                     Figure 7: HA behind the firewall

   The MN-HA Binding Update message is assumed to be IPsec encapsulated.
   This might cause problems, as some primitive firewalls do not
   recognize IPsec traffic and hence drop the packets because of the
   absence of any transport header.  One approach is to use UDP
   encapsulation of IPsec traffic in order to overcome this problem.
   Another is using NSIS NAT/FW NSLP to signal the firewall to allow
   such traffic to traverse.

   The MN initiates the NSIS signaling to create rules that will allow
   the Binding Update messages to go through the firewall.  The MN then
   sends the Binding Update message to the HA.

      For the BU (IPsec ESP in transport mode) traffic from MN to the
      HA, the MN installs rules using CREATE for the flow-id will be:
      SA: CoA, DA: HA, SPIx

   By default, the rules previously installed in the firewall will not
   allow the HoTI message to go through.  Hence, the MN has to install a
   different set of rules for these signaling messages by initiating
   another NAT/FW NSLP signaling exchange.  After that it sends the HoTI

   message to the HA.  The HA installs rules between the HA and the CN
   and accordingly send the HoTI to the CN.  The HoT message from the CN
   to the HA is also allowed by the SPF as it belongs to the session
   previously installed by the HA.  The HoT message from the HA to the
   MN is also allowed as it is initiated by the HA.  The RRT completes
   successfully.

      For the HoTI message (IPsec ESP in tunnel mode) from MN to the HA,
      the MN installs rules using CREATE the flow-id: SA: CoA, DA: HA,
      SPIx.

      For the HoTI message from HA to the CN, the HA installs rules
      using CREATE for the flow-id: SA: HoA, DA: CN.

   Detailed message flow between MN and HA is shown in Figure 8.

   For the data traffic, there is no additional signaling as the MN
   sends data directly to CN and none of these networks (CN network and
   MN network) are protected by firewalls.  This is applicable for both

   cases when either MN or CN is the data senders.

5.2.  Bi-directional tunneling

   Here, it is necessary that the HA open pinholes for the data traffic
   from the CN using EXT.  The CN is then allowed to send the data
   traffic through the FW.  After intercepting a packet, the HA tunnels
   it to the MN.  Figure 9 shows the message flow.

6.  Additional Discussions

   To support the operations described in this draft, it would be
   desirable if the NSIS NAT/FW NSLP has the ability to discover the
   presence and the characteristics (e.g., uplink or downlink filter) of
   firewalls.  This will be useful in several cases.

   For instance, it would be desirable if one could detect whether a
   firewall exists, if no, then NAT/FW NSLP will be unnecessary.
   Moreover, it is necessary to determine where (i.e., in which MIPv6
   segment/scenario) is the firewall.  This will be very useful to
   provide multiple firewall rules within a single signaling message
   exchange for multiple traffic modes (e.g., rules to allow BU and HoTI
   traverse).  Current NAT/FW NSLP [2] specification does not provide
   this ability, however, we believe it would be useful to extend it to
   be able to discover the presence and characteristics of firewalls.
   This desired feature is already discussed in [8]:

      "A client MUST be able to create pinholes and specify the
      characteristics of the pinholes to be installed in the firewalls."

   To enable the operations defined in this draft, some kind of
   interface between Mobile IPv6 and the NAT/FW NSLP is required.  This
   interface notifies the NSLP about the MIP6 actions, for example the
   roaming into a new network and provides the required information
   (CoA, HoA, ...).  This notification triggers the required operation.
   The protocol uses a firewall detection approach to determine the
   current scenario and performs the pinhole creation process necessary
   for this case.  After creation of the pinholes, MIP6 signaling is
   enabled to traverse possible firewalls.

   The operation overview will be explained in more detail in future

7.  Security Considerations

   The NAT/FW NSLP is in itself a very security sensitive service.  A
   detailed description of possible threats and countermeasures are
   described in [2].

   More details to authorization and authentication will be provided in
   the next version of this draft.
