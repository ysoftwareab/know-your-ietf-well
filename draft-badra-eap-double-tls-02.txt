1 Abstract 
 
EAP-Double-TLS is an EAP protocol that extends EAP-TLS. In EAP-TLS, 
a full TLS handshake is used to mutually authenticate a client and a 
server and to share a session key. EAP-Double-TLS extends this 
authentication negotiation by using a secure connection established 
by the TLS resumed handshake to exchange additional information 
between the client and the server. The secure connection established 
by the resumed handshake may then be used to allow the server and 
the client to securely exchange their identity and to update 
security attributes for next sessions.

EAP-Double-TLS allows a client and a server to establish keying 
material for use in the data connection between the client and the 
authenticator. The keying material is established implicitly between 
client and server based on the TLS resumed handshake.

2 Introduction 
 
The Extensible Authentication Protocol [EAP] defines a mechanism 
that may be extended with additional authentication protocols within 
PPP [PPP] such as MD5 [MD5], TLS [TLS] and PEAP [PEAP].

INTERNET DRAFT             EAP-Double-TLS              November 2004 
                
The EAP-TLS authentication protocol, described in [EAPTLS], provides 
a standard method for mutual authentication and key generation. The 
EAP-TLS requires certificates and Public Key Infrastructures (PKI) 
infrastructures well maintained and that the client and the server 
MUST be authenticated using X509 certificates. 
 
TLS itself allows a client and a server to resume sessions [TLS]. A 
secure connection may be terminated and resumed later. Secure 
sessions can be resumed if the client and the server agree. During 
this phase, the peers will use the old master_secret and the new 
random numbers to calculate new master_secret and cryptographic 
keys. This will generate fewer cryptographic computations and less 
processing time than a full TLS handshake. In addition, it will save 
the bandwidth which is the bottleneck in the wireless networks. 
 
Shared-key TLS runs as resume sessions using pre-installed secret 
key. A detailed description may be found in [SKTLS]. However, it may 
be an advantageous to use shared-key authentication handshake 
instead of PKI based certificates. Further, resumed TLS does not 
require any asymmetric cryptographic operation like RSA 
encrypt/decrypt or certificates verification. 
 
EAP-Double-TLS is an EAP protocol that extends EAP-TLS. In EAP-TLS, 
a TLS handshake is used to mutually authenticate a client and a 
server. EAP-Double-TLS extends this authentication negotiation by 
using the secure connection established by the resumed handshake to 
securely exchange additional information between the client and the 
server. In EAP-Double-TLS, the authentication is established using 
pre installed key on both the client and the server. It uses 
symmetric encryption to allay the PKI requirements of [EAPTLS], 
[PEAP] or [EAP-TTLS].  The secure connection established by the 
resumed handshake may then be used to allow the server to 
authenticate the client using certificate authentication 
infrastructures. 
 
EAP-Double-TLS allows anonymous exchanges and identity protection 
against eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle and other cryptographic 
attacks. It allows also the client and the server to update security 
attributes for next sessions and then to ensure the PFS (Perfect 
Forward Secrecy). 
 
Further, EAP-Double-TLS provides a mechanism for session key 
establishment for encryption protocols within PPP such as PPP-DES 
[PPPDES] and PPP-3DES [PPP3DES] protocols. 
 
2.1 Requirements language 
 
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119.

3 Protocol overview 
 
3.1 EAP identity protection  
 
At the beginning of an EAP session, EAP identity (EAP-ID) is 
transmitted in clear text, in the identity response message. This 
parameter is used by the authenticator to forward EAP packets to the 
authentication server which in turn uses it as an index for users' 
database management.  
 
In EAP-Double-TLS, EAP-ID SHOULD be replaced either by the TLS 
session_id value (see 3.2) or by the session_id concatenated to the 
authentication server address (session_id@server.com).  
 
This process will protect the user's privacy against surveillance 
and make the subscriber's EAP exchanges untraceable to 
eavesdroppers. In fact, the current session_id will be replaced by a 
new one computing during phase 2 (see 3.2).  
 
3.2 Overview of the EAP-Double-TLS conversation 
 
In order to apply the use of TLS resumed session, we suggest sharing 
a TLS session between the client and the server. The session is 
identified by the session_id (in TLS terminology). It corresponds 
to, among others, the value of the master_secret and the 
cipher_suite. The cipher_suite represents the cryptographic option 
supported by both the server and the client and it is initialized by 
both the client and the server to a particular option.  
 
The shared session may be stocked on a client smartcard.  
 
In general, EAP-Double-TLS negotiation comprises two phases (figure 
1): 
 
During phase 1, TLS resumed handshake is used for mutual 
authentication and key generation. This phase uses a cipher suite 
allowing phase 2 to securely exchange TLS records or other security 
protocols payloads. 
 
The phase 2 of EAP-Double-TLS may be a full TLS handshakes with 
mutual authentication, only server-side authentication, or 
anonymous. It MAY also be established using any mechanism that can 
generate session key like Kerberos. 
 
Note: If servers or clients don∆t care about anonymity and/or PFS, 
they can be satisfied by the phase 1 negotiation. For authorization 
or additional authentication requirements, the client and the server 
can use any mechanism they implement (e.g. MD5, MSCHAP, etc.).

During phase 2, TLS records are exchanged in an encrypted manner 
using the established tunnel in order to optionally perform 
authorization and authentication mechanisms and to refresh the 
parameters of the shared session (e.g. session_id and 
master_secret).

3.1.1 Phase 1: TLS PSK Handshake 
 
In phase 1, the EAP-Double-TLS begins with the authenticator sending 
an EAP-Request/Identity packet to the peer. The peer will respond 
with an EAP-Response/Identity packet to the authenticator, 
containing the peer's UserId. Once this is established, the 
authenticator MAY act as a pass-through device, with the EAP packets 
received from the peer being encapsulated for transmission to a 
RADIUS server or backend security server.

INTERNET DRAFT             EAP-Double-TLS              November 2004 
                
When the server receives the peer's Identity, it MUST respond with 
an EAP-Double-TLS/Start packet. This is an EAP-Request packet with 
EAP-Type= EAP-Double-TLS, the Start (S) bit set and no data.  
 
When receiving this message, the peer will answer by EAP-Response 
packet with EAP-Type= EAP-Double-TLS. The data field encapsulates 
the TLS client_hello resumed handshake message. This message 
contains, among others parameters, a random number and the 
session_Id corresponds to the shared session the client wishes to 
use. 
 
The server then checks its sessions' database for a match. If a 
match is found, the server responses with EAP-Request with EAP-Type= 
EAP-Double-TLS. This packet will encapsulate the TLS server_hello 
resumed handshake with the same session_id value sent by the client 
and another random number. 
 
Following the hello messages, the server will send its TLS change 
cipher spec message and proceed directly to TLS finished message. 
The TLS finished massage will serve to authenticate the server to 
the client since it is calculated using the pre-installed key. 
 
If the EAP server authenticates successfully (the peer will 
calculate the same finished value using the pre-installed key), the 
peer MUST send an EAP-Response packet of EAP-Type= EAP-Double-TLS, 
that transports the TLS change cipher spec and finished messages. 
Once this establishment is complete, the client and the server MAY 
begin to exchange phase 2 data. Otherwise, the server will 
distribute data connection keying information and other 
authorization information to the access point. 
 
If the EAP server authenticates unsuccessfully, the peer MAY send an 
EAP-Response packet of EAP-Type= EAP-Double-TLS containing a TLS 
Alert message identifying the reason for the failed authentication. 
Alert messages with a level of fatal result in the immediate 
termination of the connection. 
 
In order to make sure that the server receives the TLS alert 
message, the peer MUST wait for the server to reply before 
terminating the conversation. Like in [EAPTLS], the server MUST 
reply with an EAP-Failure packet since server authentication failure 
is a terminal condition. 
 
If the peer authenticates unsuccessfully, the server MAY send an 
EAP-Response packet of EAP-Type= EAP-Double-TLS containing a TLS 
Alert message identifying the reason for the failed authentication. 
Alert messages with a level of fatal result in the immediate 
termination of the connection.

In order to make sure that the peer receives the TLS alert message, 
the server MUST wait for the peer to reply before terminating the 
conversation. 
 
3.1.2 Phase 2 
 
This Phase will occur after establishment of a TLS resumed Handshake 
in Phase 1 is successful. This phase MAY be established to ensure 
additional services such as client identity protection and PFS and 
to apply more authentication and authorization policies. 
 
3.1.1.1 Case 1: TLS Handshake  
 
During the phase 2, TLS Record Layer is used to securely tunnel a 
TLS session. The TLS session information is encapsulated in 
sequences of TLS attributes, whose use and format are described in 
[TLS]. 
 
TLS Mutual authentication, server-side authentication or TLS anonym 
may be established, depending on the policies chosen. 
 
In this phase, the server begins the exchange by sending the EAP-
Double-TLS/HelloRequest to the client. This message is sent to 
indicate to the peer the success of phase 1 establishment session 
and the beginning of phase 2 (new TLS session). The hello request 
message is defined in [TLS] and may be sent by the server at any 
time. 
 
If the client agrees, it and the server continue the exchange of EAP 
packets to complete the new TLS handshake, as described in [TLS]. 
This phase is completed when the client and the server exchange 
change cipher spec and finished messages. 
 
If this phase is successfully perfected, the client MUST send an 
EAP-Response packet of EAP-Type= EAP-Double-TLS, and no data. The 
EAP-Server then MUST respond with an EAP-Success message. 
 
At this point, the server will distribute data connection keying 
information and other authorization information to the access point. 
Note that in this case of TLS Handshake, EAP-Double-TLS products, as 
part of the new TLS handshake protocol, new session key and new 
master_secret key. Thus, the server will distribute the pre-
installed key (used in phase 1). Next, the server and the client 
replace the shared session used in the first phase with the new 
session established in the second phase. In other words, they 
replace the pre-installed key and the correspondent session_id with 
the session_id and the master_secret generated and calculated during 
phase 2. The new TLS session will be then used for the next EAP-
Double-TLS session.

3.1.1.2 Case 2: Other authentication and authorization mechanisms 
 
In order to extend the EAP-Double-TLS with other authentication and 
authorization mechanisms, EAP-Double-TLS phase 2 MAY be established 
using any mechanism that can generate session key like Kerberos. In 
this case and after establishment of a TLS resumed Handshake in 
Phase 1 is successful, the server MAY request for additional 
authentication and authorization information. Thus, the server sends 
an EAP request indicating the EAP method type (method has the 
ability of generating session keys).

3.5. CCP and CCP negotiation 
 
See section 3.6 and 3.7 of RFC 2716. 
 
3.6. Inner method encapsulation 
 
As stated before, EAP-Double-TLS uses the TLS record layer to tunnel 
information between the client and the server to, among others 
operations perform additional authentication and authorization 
mechanisms. In this optic, EAP-Double-TLS reuses the attribute-value 
pairs (AVPs) defined in [EAPTTLS].  
 
3.7. Examples 
 
The following exchanges show where TLS Handshake with certificate or 
anonymous key exchange change within Phase 2, the conversation will 
be as follows:

4 EAP-Double-TLS protocol within EAP Smartcards 
 
EAP-support in smartcards is described and detailed by an Internet 
draft [EAPSC]. It is an opened, ISO 7816 microcontroller supporting 
most authentication protocols. An EAP smartcard implements an EAP 
method (EAP-TLS, etc) and works in cooperation with a smartcard 
interface entity, which transparently sends and receives EAP 
messages to and from this component. 
 
Smartcard is one of the news technologies added to the world of 
information technology. In fact, they can make significant impact on 
current computer systems and network environments because of their 
inherent security and mobility. Further, they are an effective means 
of adding enhanced protection to wireless networks; namely 802.11 
wireless LAN. Added to that, they are widely used in the Global 
System for Mobile Communication (GSM) [GSM] in the form of a SIM 
(Subscriber Identity Module) card for secure access to the mobile 
network, for storing basic network information and for 
accounting/billing procedures.

Smartcards have a bear particular attraction, as they generally 
considered as the most secure computing platform. In fact, they 
offer good tamper resistance. This means that certain physical 
hardware and software protections are used, which makes it difficult 
to extract or modify private and secret information in the module. 
So it seems a good idea to store the (strong) master_secret keys on 
a smartcard. Further, smartcard deployment in a typical network such 
as WLAN 802.11 [802.11] offers the enhanced functionality of tighter 
authentication. 
 
4.1 Fragmentation issues 
 
Data is exchanged between the terminal and the smartcard through a 
card acceptance device (CAD) in the form of messages exchanged from 
the terminal to the card and vice versa. Data transport is 
established by using Data Pocket called Application Protocol Data 
Unit (APDU). Each APDU consists of two fields: 5 bytes header and 0-
255 bytes of data. The ISO [ISOAPDU] standard defines these 
command/response packets that are used for reading, writing and 
exchanging data between the host and the smartcard. These packets 
transferred from the CAD to the module (command APDU) are followed 
by a response APDU from the module back to the CAD. 
 
The TLS Record Layer fragments information blocks into TLS records 
carrying data in chunks of 16384 bytes or less [TLS]. Furthermore, 
TLS message may carry multiple TLS records. Since the IEEE 802.3 MAC 
may not send frames greater than 1518 bytes in length and because 
fragmentation support is not provided by EAP, it is the 
responsibility of EAP methods to provide the fragmentation required. 
For that, EAP-Double-TLS extends the EAP-TLS segmentation method, 
which defines a segmentation process that splits TLS messages in 
smaller blocks, acknowledged by the recipient. In our 
implementation, the RADIUS server generates acknowledged requests 
and the supplicant answers by acknowledged responses. 
 
EAP-TLS defines the fragmentation mechanism for data exchanged 
between the server and the terminal. It will not define the data 
segmentation between the terminal and the smartcard because the 
latter is not readable to the EAP-TLS server. For that and in order 
to allow smartcards use, a double segmentation mechanism was 
introduces by our EAP-Double-TLS to forward TLS packets to the 
smartcard. We defined this mechanism as following. First, TLS server 
messages are divided in smaller segments (E1, E2), whose size is 
typically 1400 bytes or less (figure 2). Next, the segments are 
encapsulated in EAP-Double-TLS packets that are split in a 
collection of APDUs (A11 .. A1p .. An1 .. Anq) in the form of 
ISO7816 commands. Afterwards, the APDUs (each APDUs size is around 
240 bytes) are forwarded to the EAP-Double-TLS smartcard. Note that 
for each APDU received by the smartcard, an APDU response, with 2 
bytes of data, is generated to inform the supplicant of the APDUs 
status (if the APDU was arrived and correctly processed or no).

Figure 2 - Smartcard double segmentation using EAP-Double-TLS   
           Authentication Protocol 
 
However, for the smartcard part and in order to prevent multiple 
segmentation and re-assembly operations, the maximum EAP message 
length of a no fragmented packet SHALL be set to 240 bytes. For a 
fragmented EAP message, the maximum length value shall be 240 bytes. 
 
As defined in EAP-TLS, when the EAP-Double-TLS smartcard receives an 
EAP-Request packet with the M bit set, it MUST respond with an EAP-
Response with EAP-Type=EAP-TLS and no data.  This serves as a 
fragment ACK.

6 Security Considerations 
 
The EAP-Double-TLS server MUST stock the session in a secure and 
protected manner in order to prevent attackers from retrieving the 
master_secret values and other session's parameters. 
 
6.1 Security claims 
 
This section describes EAP-Double-TLS in terms of specific security 
terminology as required by [EAP]. 
 
6.1.1   Authentication, confidentiality and integrity protection  
 
EAP-Double-TLS provides mutual authenticated, encrypted and 
integrity protected tunnel using TLS resumed Handshake [TLS]. All 
data (including Success/Failure notification) within the tunnel are 
then protected against man in the middle and eavesdropping attacks. 
 
6.1.2   Protected cipher suite negotiation  
 
TLS Handshake protocol offers an integrated mechanism to protect 
cipher suite negotiation [TLS]. 
 
6.1.3   User identity protection  
 
See sections 3.1 and 3.2. 
 
6.1.4   Replay protection  
 
TLS Record protocol [TLS] natively protects against replay attacks 
using sequence numbers. 
 
6.1.5   Key derivation (and updating) 
 
Based on [EAPTLS], EAP-Double-TLS derives Keying material after each 
successful Handshake happened in its both phases.  Phase 1 allows 
the client and the server to generate a master_secret applying the 
TLS-PRF on the pre_shared_key, ClientHello.random and 
ServerHello.random. 
 
As stated, EAP-Double-TLS MAY use any inner authentication method 
that is capable to generate session keys. The inner method is used 
to refresh the master_secret and the session_id of the session used 
during the phase 1. Thus, the old master_secret (of the shared 
session) is used to derive and generate keying material. 
 
EAP-Double-TLS uses the TLS-PRF to generate and refresh the 
master_secret key as following:

INTERNET DRAFT             EAP-Double-TLS              November 2004 
                
Let denote OMS the pre shared key used during phase 1, DMS the 
master_secret derived during the phase 1, NMS the new master_secret 
and FK the fresh key generated during the phase 2. 
 
DMS is derived as following:  
 
         DMS = PRF(OMS, "master_secret",   
                   ClientHello.random + ServerHello.random)[0..48]  
 
This DMS is used to derive keying material used to encrypt and to 
calculate the MAC of each message. Keys derived from DMS are then 
delivered to the Access Point for additional keys computation. 
 
If the inner method is TLS, then the NMS (or the FK) is generated by 
applying the PRF on the pre_master_secret of the new TLS session and 
the new client and server random values exchanged during the TLS 
Handshake (phase 2). TLS generates also new session that will 
replace the old session. 
 
If the inner method is not TLS, the NMS is generated by applying the 
PRF on the key generated by the inner method (FK) and the client and 
server random values exchanged during the phase 1. in this case, 
both the client and the server refresh the old session's parameters 
by replacing the NMS with the OMS and the old session_id with the 
result of the following PRF:  
        
         PRF(The first 8 bytes of the OMS, "session_id",   
             ClientHello.random + ServerHello.random)[0..32]  
 
6.1.6   Key strength  
 
EAP-Double-TLS reuses the TLS-PRF for keys generation (See [TLS]). 
 
6.1.7   Dictionary attack protection  
 
EAP-Double-TLS resists against dictionary attacks by offering 
protection based on strong cryptographic algorithms that are 
supported by TLS [TLS]. 
 
6.1.8   Fast reconnect  
 
While EAP-Double-TLS is based on TLS, fast reconnection option is 
implicitly included; executing TLS resumed Handshake (as described 
in phase 1). 
 
6.1.9   Channel binding and man-in-middle-attacks protection 
 
EAP-Double-TLS does not explicitly include any channel binding. 
However, it mitigates man-in-the-middle vulnerabilities via the 
mutual authentication during phase 1.

6.1.10  Session independence and forward secrecy  
 
EAP-Double-TLS independently generates keys per session. For 
example, executing TLS anonym as an inner method (during phase 2) 
provides Perfect Forward Secrecy (Deffie-Hellman or temporary RSA 
are both supported by TLS as key exchange methods).
