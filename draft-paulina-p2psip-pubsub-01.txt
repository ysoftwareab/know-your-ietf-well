Abstract

   This document introduces a generic publish-subscribe protocol, that 
   can be built on top of RELOAD or P2PP. It works both for the 
   unstructured and DHT-based Peer-to-Peer networks. Moreover it is 
   highly customizable to address the optimization issues and support 
   different topology structures. It can be used to implement P2P-SIP 
   services such as presence or event notification.

1. Introduction

   The publish-subscribe protocol described in this paper is built on
   top of the generic P2P protocols such as RELOAD[1] and P2PP[2]. Both 
   of them make the differences between peer-to-peer routing algorithms 
   transparent to the higher-layer applications. Our main concern while 
   designing the publish-subscribe protocol was to preserve this  
   transparency in the presence of a great variety of overlay types. The 
   proposed protocol may exchange messages both directly between the 
   specified peers or by encapsulating them in the resource objects and  
   sending inside the P2P insert request. A set of callback methods has 
   been defined to let the publish-subscribe layer capture the incoming  
   P2P requests, process them and modify the default P2P protocol 
   behavior if it is necessary. In this document we describe the generic 
   protocol, that works both for the unstructured and DHT-based P2P 
   networks. It can be easily configured to optimize its behavior using  
   the overlay-specific features or simply replaced by a set of 
   different algorithms for the various P2P networks. Both operations 
   are completely transparent for the higher-layer applications and
   topology-independent. Additionally we also define the Access Control
   Rules (AC), which allows higher-layer application to let some of the
   users subscribe for the specified topic without granting them
   permission to generate events. These rules are stored by all the
   topic subscribers, as they can be responsible for accepting other
   nodes' requests. The proposed publish-subscribe protocol also
   provides so called Interest Conditions (IC) which can be used as a
   simple filter for the received events. Each node can define the
   group of users generating interesting events. Each node also stores
   a certain number of events, that have recently been published for
   the topic. The new subscriber may ask for sending some or all of 
   them after the successful subscription process. Nodes may also store
   a configurable number of the 'backup nodes' in the special caches,
   to use them in case of the direct parent's failure. The proposed  
   protocol allows replacement of the default publish-subscribe 
   algorithm with some other ones. This means that it may be integrated 
   with a set of different algorithms to be dynamically loaded depending 
   on the underlying overlay type (for instance Scribe-like for Pastry

   and some other for different ones). Moreover such operation is 
   completely transparent for the higher-layer applications and 
   topology-independent. 

   Due to the terminology differences between P2PP and RELOAD, in this 
   document we use 'insert' for the P2PP publish object and RELOAD 
   store request, and 'lookup' for the P2PP lookup and RELOAD fetch 
   request where distinguishing one from another is not essential.

   This document is organized as follows. Section 3 describes the core
   components of the protocol and briefly explains, how the proposed 
   mechanism may be extended. The proposed protocol MAY be integrated
   with many different publish-subscribe algorithms. Section 4 describes
   the elements common for all of them, introduces the default algorithm
   and shows how it can be configured to optimize its behavior for 
   the DHT-based overlays. Detailed information about integration of the 
   publish-subscribe protocol with P2PP and RELOAD are presented in 
   section 5.


2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].


   Some of the terminology has been borrowed from the P2PP[1] and 
   RELOAD[2] drafts.

   Topic owner: The node which has created the topic.

   Topic root: A non-leaf node in the topology structure - indirect
               parent for all the other nodes. It MAY be a topic
               subscriber or not. In the DHT-based overlays, it
               will be the peer with id numerically closest to the
               topic identifier.

   Topic history: Every node participating in the topology structure,
                  that is able to accept new subscribers (which means 
                  it is a peer, not client) stores the list of the 
                  events that have recently been published for the
                  specified topic. During the subscription process 
                  node can ask its parent to send some, or all of  
                  them. History only refers to the custom events, not  
                  the predefined ones, such as AC_MODIFIED.

   Topic cache: The backup list of nodes participating in the topology   
                structure which is used in case of detecting the 
                direct parent's failure. There may be several types of
                caches stored be a single node.

   To provide a generic and highly extensible publish-subscribe
   mechanism we decided to split it, as it is shown in the figure

   various components of the publish-subscribe layer.

3.2 Publish-subscribe transport

   This component is directly responsible for the communication. It
   passes the incoming publish-subscribe messages to the Core Algorithm
   and sends the outgoing ones. It hides the details of the sending
   procedure - for example encapsulates a publish-subscribe message
   inside the network resource object if it is to be sent within the
   P2P insert request. All the publish-subscribe requests may be routed
   either directly to some specified node, or using the overlay-specific  
   algorithm. The second method is chosen, when the exact destination is
   not defined - for example to determine the root during the topic
   creation procedure in a DHT-based network. Indications and responses
   are always passed directly to a specified node.

   [TODO: Perhaps for the direct connections publish-subscribe 
   use RELOAD's Attach() - as it was described in the SIP Usage]


3.3 Core Algorithm

   This component provides the core features of the publish-subscribe
   layer which are to be common for all the Customizable Algorithms.
   All the incoming messages are passed directly to this component. It
   checks whether it stores information about the specified topic (or
   does not store - for the create topic request) and whether the 
   message originator is allowed to perform a certain operation. If 
   both requirements are fulfilled, it passes the message to the 
   Customizable Algorithm or the Topology Manager. Otherwise it sends 
   the response with an appropriate error code to the request 
   originator itself. It is also responsible for forwarding the events
   notifications to the node's children and checking IC, before 
   passing them to the higher-layer application. Probably the most 
   interesting feature of this component is its ability to query the 
   P2P layer for the overlay type and dynamically load the appropriate
   algorithm with the suitable configuration. This can be achieved by 
   defining a separate Algorithm Configurator that is used by the Core
   Algorithm to create an appropriate Customizable Algorithm object. 
   The choice of the suitable component is made on the basis of the 
   underlying P2P network type. This object is also able to configure
   such parameters as the size of the caches. Caches store the lists 
   of the 'backup nodes' to be used in case of detecting the direct 
   parent's failure. Each node may store several types of such lists,
   for example associated with different levels of the multicast  
   tree. The decision on the number of caches depends on the  
   Customizable Algorithm component's policy. Each parent is  
   responsible for filling its children's caches by periodically    
   sending them keep-alive messages containing the appropriate lists
   of nodes. Storing such information is essential in the 
   unstructured networks. However it may not be crucial in the 
   DHT-based ones, where the topology structure can be repaired at a
   relatively low cost using the overlay-specific routing algorithm,

   without performing the complex lookup procedures. In such case
   the Algorithm Configurator may set the cache size to 0 and treat
   event notifications as a heartbeat messages to reduce the additional
   traffic associated with the structure maintenance. Moreover, if some 
   new Customizable Algorithm requires sending any additional
   information in a standard publish-subscribe message - it can 
   register this extended message format to make the Core Algorithm
   load it instead of the standard message object after receiving the
   specified request. For example the default Customizable Algorithm
   stores the information about the Interest Conditions locally, but 
   some different algorithm may choose to built the IC-based multicast 
   tree, where the child's IC are the subset of its parent's IC. This 
   requires adding the information about the IC to the standard
   subscribe request. Such extended message can be registered using
   the Algorithm Configurator. Figure 3.3.1 illustrates the usage of 
   this component.

3.4 Customizable Algorithm

   This component implements all the methods from the Publish-Subscribe 
   Interface and takes care of the processing of most of them. For 
   instance the create topic operation requires performing different 
   procedures in the DTH-based and unstructured overlays. In the first
   case it is enough to encapsulate the create topic request inside the 
   P2P insert request, giving the topic identifier as an object key. 
   The unstructured networks require performing the lookup procedure to 
   ensure that some other node has not created the specified topic 
   before. It is also necessary to place the SUBSCRIPTIONINFO objects 
   in the P2P network to inform other nodes about the existing 
   participants of the topology structure created for the particular

   topic. Additionally in the DHT-based networks transferring certain 
   topics to the new root may be necessary, if some new node joins the
   P2P network and its ID is closer to the topic ID according to the 
   overlay-specific distance metrics. The Customizable Algorithm 
   component also takes part in the topology structure creation 
   process - this feature is described in details in the next section.


3.5 Topology Manager

   This component is responsible for creating and maintaining the 
   specified topology structure. It handles all the subscribe requests 
   and takes part in the topic transfers. Currently there are two 
   structures defined: star and multicast tree. For the first one, 
   topology manager only ensures, that none of the nodes except the 
   topic root accepts new subscribers. The situation is slightly more 
   complex for the multicast trees. For instance the Customizable 
   Algorithm component may require creating IC-based trees. Then the 
   node, receiving a  subscribe request, must check whether the new 
   subscriber's IC are the subset of its own ones. If it is not - it 
   has to forward the request to the higher level of the multicast
   tree because it will not be receiving all the events that are   
   interesting to the new subscriber. In such cases Topology Manager 
   must consult the Customizable Algorithm component to identify the 
   next hop for forwarding the subscribe request. Figure 3.5.1 
   illustrates the subscribe procedure that uses the described 
   mechanism. Figure 3.5.2 shows the structure that does not apply 
   any additional rules for accepting the new subscribers. In this 
   case the marked node B may not be receiving all the interesting 
   events.

3.6 Publish-Subscribe API


3.6.1 Publish-Subscribe Interface

   Application issues a publish-subscribe request using one of the 
   methods described below. All of them are implemented by the 
   Customizable Algorithm component. Each operation is asynchronous, as
   it can take a long time to complete. Parameters enclosed in the  
   square brackets are optional. 

   void createTopic(String topicId, boolean subscribe, 
                    [AccessControlRules ac])

   @param topicId Topic identifier.

   @param subscribe Value indicating whether this node wants to 
                    automatically subscribe for the specified topic 
                    after its creation. In this case the 'create topic'
                    request is specially prepared and there is no need 
                    to send a separate 'subscribe' request later on.     

   @param ac Access control rules defined for the operations associated 
             with this topic.



   void removeTopic(String topicId)

   @param topicId Topic identifier.



   void subscribe(String topicId, [InterestConditions ic], 
                  [int eventIndex])

   @param topicId Topic identifier.

   @param ic Object representing Interest Conditions defined for the 
             particular topic by the higher-layer application.

   @param eventIndex Value indicating which events from the topic 
                     history node wants to receive after successfully 
                     completing the subscribe operation.

   void unsubscribe(String topicId)

   @param topicId Topic identifier.



   void publish(String topicId, Event e)

   @param topicId Topic identifier.

   @param e Event to be published.


3.6.2 Publish-Subscribe Callbacks

   Additionally the publish-subscribe layer defines a set of callback
   methods, which are invoked after completing asynchronous operations
   and can be implemented by the higher-layer application. These methods
   are described below.

   public void onTopicSubscribe(String topicId)

   @param topicId Topic identifier.

   Called after a successful subscription.


   public void onTopicCreate(String topicId)

   @param topicId Created topic identifier.

   Called after a successful topic creation.



   public void onTopicNotify(String topicId, byte[] message)

   @param topicId Topic identifier.

   @param message Message encapsulated in the received event.

   Called when node receives a custom event notification.



   public void onTopicRemove(String topicId)

   @param topicId Removed topic identifier.

   Called when node receives the notification informing that the 
   particular topic has been removed.

   public void onPubSubError(String topicId, Operation o, int errorCode)

   @param topicId Topic identifier.

   @param o Operation which failed to complete successfully.

   @param errorCode Error code.

   Called when an asynchronous operation fails to complete successfully.


4. Publish-Subscribe Protocol


4.1 General information


4.1.1 Topic

   Apart from the identifier, there are several information stored for 
   each topic:

   1) Owner
 
      The node which has created the topic

   2) Parent

      Node's parent in the topology structure
 
   3) Access Control Rules 

      Described in details in the section 4.1.6

   4) Interest Conditions

      Described in details in the section 4.1.5

   5) Subscription list 
   
      The list of topic subscribers, which are this node's children in 
      the topology structure

   6) Caches

      The backup information about other nodes participating in the 
      topology structure

   7) Distance

      The distance between the peer id and the topic id (calculated

      using the overlay-specific metrics)

   8) History

      The list of the previously published events for the specified 
      topic


4.1.2 Subscriber

   Apart from the topic identifier, this object contains information 
   such as:

   1) User name 

      User name in the Peer-to-Peer network

   2) Peer id 
  
      Peer id in the Peer-to-Peer network

   3) IP address

   4) Port number 
  
      Port used for exchanging the publish-subscribe messages directly


4.1.3 Subscription 

   Subscription contains the following information:

   1) Subscriber 

   2) Expiration time 

      How long the subscription is valid - after this period node needs
      to resubscribe


4.1.4 Event

   Every publish-subscribe event contains information about its 
   publisher and the identifier of the topic it is associated with. The 
   proposed publish-subscribe protocol defines three types of events: 

   - remove topic - informs all subscribers that the particular topic 
     has been removed

   - AC modified - informs all subscribers that the Access Control Rules 
     (section 4.1.6) for the specified topic have been modified

   - custom - this event encapsulates the user-defined events 


4.1.5 Interest conditions

   Each subscriber can define its Interest Conditions (IC) for the
   topic. This means he can declare that he wants to receive information
   only about the events published by a specified group of users. It can
   be described as follows:

   operation:  eventtype(ALL): interestingusers[]
               eventtype(...):interestingusers[]

   If the 'interestingusers' list for the specified event type is empty,
   it means that it is always interesting regardless the publisher. The   
   conditions defined for the event type ALL are always checked first.
   If the 'interestingusers' list for it is empty, the decision on 
   whether the specified event is interesting or not, depends on the
   'interestingusers' associated with the particular event type.

   If there is no rule defined for some operation or event - it means it
   is not interesting at all.

   By default all the subscribers will be receiving every topic event. 
   It means that each non-leaf node in the topology structure has to 
   pass every event to all of its children. IC are defined locally and 
   checked by the topic subscriber before invoking the higher-layer 
   notify callback. Otherwise the node's parent in the topology 
   structure would have to define similar IC (to receive all the events,
   that are interesting for its children). Additionally after modifying
   IC, subscriber would in some cases have to be passed to a different 
   parent in the topology structure, generating extra traffic.

   If IC for some topic are defined as follows: 

   NOTIFY: eventtype(ALL):
           eventtype(REMOVETOPIC): 
           eventtype(MODIFYAC): 
           eventtype(CUSTOM): user1, user2, user3

   then after receiving a CUSTOM notification from user1, 2 or 3, node
   will inform higher layer about it. REMOVETOPIC and MODIFYAC events 
   are by default interesting regardless the publisher.


4.1.6 Access control rules

   Nodes can define a set of rules for the topic, to grant other users
   different access permissions (AC). These rules can be described as
   follows:


Adamska, et al.         Expires October 13, 2009              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft              Publish-Subscribe                 May 2009

  
   operation:  eventtype(ALL): allowusers[]
               eventtype(...): allowusers[]

   If the 'allowusers' list for a specified event type is empty, it 
   means that the associated operation can be performed by any 
   subscriber. The permissions defined for the event type ALL are always 
   checked first. If the 'allowusers' list for it is empty, then 
   granting access permission depends exclusively on the 'allowusers' 
   defined for the particular event type.

   If there is no rule for some operation or event - it means it is not
   allowed.

   For example if the rules for some topic are: 

   SUBSCRIBE: eventtype(ALL): user1, user2, user3, user4 
   PUBLISH: eventtype(ALL):
            eventtype(REMOVETOPIC): user1
            eventtype(MODIFYAC): user1
            eventtype(CUSTOM): user1, user2, user3

   It means that:
   - Only user1 is allowed to modify AC rules for the topic. By default 
     this permission is granted exclusively to the topic owner.
   - If the topology structure participant receives a 'subscribe' 
     request for example from user5, subscription will fail due to 
     access control restrictions. Only users 1, 2, 3 and 4 are allowed
     to subscribe for the topic. 
   - User4 may (according to SUBSCRIBE rules) subscribe for receiving 
     the topic events, but isn't allowed (according to PUBLISH rules) to    
     generate them. Users 1, 2 and 3 are all allowed to publish 
     user-defined events, but only user1 has permission to remove this 
     topic. By default only topic owner has permission to publish the 
     predefined events such as REMOVETOPIC or MODIFYAC. 

   In case of any collisions in the AC rules - the most important is the
   one marked with ALL clause. For example if the rules are defined as
   follows:

   PUBLISH: eventtype(ALL): user1, user2, user3
            eventtype(REMOVETOPIC): user1
            eventtype(MODIFYAC): user1
            eventtype(CUSTOM): user4

   User4 will not be able to publish any event, because the first rule 
   to be checked is: eventtype(ALL): user1, user2, user3. It could be 
   repaired either by removing the 'allowusers' list for event type ALL,
   or adding user4 to it.

   The topic owner always retains permission to modify AC rules and 
   remove the topic, but it can also grant it to other users. Rules

   defined for the 'notify' operation MAY differ for different nodes. By
   default each subscriber will only accept event notifications from its
   parent in the topology structure.


4.2 Default Customizable Algorithm

   This section describes the default Customizable Algorithm component's   
   behavior and the possibilities of configuring it to address the
   optimization issues. In some cases it is essential to determine
   whether the underlying P2P network is a DHT-based or an unstructured
   one. To fulfill this requirement we define an additional method that
   asks the generic P2P protocol to calculate the distance between the
   two given keys according to the overlay-specific metrics. Such
   calculations are possible only in a DHT-based network. Each
   publish-subscribe Customizable Algorithm component MUST implement
   the set of operations defined in this section. In the diagrams shown
   in this section we use '{PUBSUB}msg' notation to indicate, that the
   message 'msg' is sent directly to the specified node and
   '{P2P}insert(msg)' in case of messages encapsulated within an insert
   request.   

4.2.1 Create topic

   To perform this operation node encapsulates the 'create topic' 
   message inside the P2P resource object, sets its key to the topic ID 
   and sends it within the P2P insert request. In the DHT-based networks
   it is enough for the node receiving such request to check, whether it
   does not store information about the specified topic itself 
   (figure 4.2.1). The unstructured networks require some lookup 
   procedure to determine, whether the topic has not been created by a 
   different node (figure 4.2.2). Such situation may occur, because the
   object encapsulated inside the P2P resource object will in most cases
   be stored by the 'create topic' request originator. This is where the
   idea of the SUBSCRIPTIONINFO objects comes along. They are associated
   with the particular topic and contain contact information about its 
   subscribers. The status of such object may be PENDING or ACCEPTED. 
   The difference between both states will be explained later on. Each
   node receiving a 'create topic' request places a pending 
   SUBSCRIPTIONINFO object in the underlying P2P network. Then it looks 
   for other objects associated with the specified topic. If there is at
   least one with the accepted status - it assures us that the specified
   topic already exists. If the underlying P2P network stores only the 
   pending SUBSCRIPTIONINFO objects, than the peer with the lowest ID is
   allowed to become the root for the specified topic. All the others 
   are supposed to remove their SUBSCRIPTIONINFO objects and send the
   response with an appropriate error code. The 'create topic' request 
   may additionally contain a list of nodes, which are to be added to 
   the topic subscribers after successfully completing the operation. 
   This way its originator does not have to issue a separate 'subscribe'
   request later on. The 'create topic' message may also be used to

   transfer the topic to the new root, in which case a special flag is
   set to indicate that this request refers to an existing topic. 
   Regardless the purpose, the described request always contains AC 
   rules defined for the topic.

4.2.2 Transfer topic

   This operation is essential for the DHT-based networks. It MAY be
   performed when the publish-subscribe layer receives the information
   from the P2P layer, that it has accepted the other node's join 
   request. In such case the node iterates through all the topics it 
   stores information about. If it is the root for one of them and the
   distance between the new peer's ID and the topic ID is smaller than
   the distance calculated for this node, it sends a create topic 
   request inside the P2P insert message. Before sending the request, 
   the previous root MAY also add the list of its direct children to it.
   All of the procedures associated with the topic transfer are 
   performed by the Topology Manager component, as it is responsible for
   retaining the appropriate structure. For instance in the star 
   topology, all the request originator's children must be passed to the
   new root as well. If some Customizable Algorithm component is 
   designed exclusively for the unstructured networks, it MAY choose not
   to perform this procedure or use a different measure than the 
   distance between identifiers to determine, whether the specified 
   topic should be transfered. The brief description of the whole 
   procedure is shown in the figure 4.2.2.1.

 Figure 4.2.2.3: Processing the transfer request(a) and response(b) by 
                            the multicast tree


4.2.3 Remove topic

   To perform this operation, the node publishes the predefined 
   REMOVE_TOPIC event among the topic subscribers. After that all the 
   SUBSCRIPTIONINFO objects associated with this topic MUST be removed
   from the underlying P2P network. 


4.2.4 Subscribe

   To subscribe for a topic, node has to send a 'subscribe' request to
   the peer that is already participating in the appropriate topology 
   structure. Determining the message destination is crucial for the 
   whole procedure. In the DHT-based networks it is enough to 
   encapsulate the publish-subscribe request in the resource object. 
   Then it can be captured using the P2P protocol callbacks. The 
   unstructured networks require performing the lookup procedure for the
   SUBSCRIPTIONINFO objects to identify the existing topology structure
   participants. After that the request may be sent directly to the 
   specified node. Also the multicast trees are built using a different
   approach in the unstructured and DHT-based environment. In the first
   case, node accepts only the subscribers with the ID greater than its
   own one (figure 4.2.4.1).  The nodes that do not fulfill these 
   requirements are forwarded to the direct parent. Only the topic root
   accepts all the requests unless this is forbidden by the AC rules. 
   Such an arrangement of the topology structure participants simplifies
   the recovery procedures after the direct parent's failure.

   In the unstructured networks, after successfully completing the
   described procedure, the new subscriber must place its 
   SUBSCRIPTIONINFO object in the underlying network. This is done only
   if it is a peer, as clients SHOULD NOT be responsible for accepting 
   new subscribers. The node must also locally modify the AC rules for 
   the notify operation, to indicate that only its direct parent is 
   allowed to send event notifications to it. The standard subscribe 
   request also contains the additional information, such as the index
   of the last received event. After accepting the new subscriber, its 
   parent must send the requested set of the notify messages containing
   the historical events to it. Each subscription is valid only for a
   specified time, so the node needs to renew it periodically.  


4.2.5 Unsubscribe

   If the node has no more children in the topology structure and it is
   not the topic root, it simply sends an 'unsubscribe' request directly
   to its parent and removes its SUBSCRIPTIONINFO object from the 
   overlay if it is necessary. If the node has more children, it also
   has to send the keep-alive indication to them. It is depicted in
   figure 4.2.5.1. The unsubscribe request sent to the node's parent
   contains the list of its children. Parent node has to add the new
   children to its own ones. Children nodes get keep-alive indication
   with the information about the new parent and modify their cache
   information (figure 4.2.5.2). If necessary, keep-alive indications
   are propagated down along the multicast tree to update other node's
   caches (the unsubscribing node can be stored in their grandparents
   cache). Note that after unsubscribe root node does not notify the

4.2.6 Publish

   There are three types of the predefined events that can be published
   among the topic subscribers: AC_MODIFIED, TOPIC_REMOVED and CUSTOM.
   The first one is generated, when the access control rules are
   modified. The third one represents a custom event defined by the
   higher-layer application. The default Customizable Algorithm
   component requires all the publish messages to be delivered to the
   topic root, which accepts the request, sends the appropriate response
   to its originator and the set of notify indications to the direct
   children. This is done to avoid the situation, when for example AC
   rules have been modified, but the AC_MODIFIED event has not been
   propagated among all of the topic subscribers. In such case some of
   them may accept the events from the node which is not allowed to
   generate them anymore. In the default Customizable Algorithm
   component AC rules are defined so, that only the node's parent in the
   topology structure is allowed to send event notifications to it. Note
   that there are two situations, in which such indication may be
   received. The first one is when a new event is generated by some
   node. In this case the notification SHOULD be forwarded down along
   the multicast tree. However it might happen that the new subscriber
   receives the requested historical events after successfully 
   completing the subscribe operation. In such case no further
   forwarding is needed. The node only updates its own topic history and
   invokes the higher-layer callback. The default Customizable Algorithm
   component also requires the node to be a topic subscriber to generate
   events.


4.2.7 Notify

   After receiving a publish request, topic root propagates the event
   among its children using the notify message. Like all indications, 
   notifications are send directly to the specified nodes. Figure
   4.2.7.1 briefly describes the procedure performed after receiving
   such message. By default the Customizable Algorithm component defines
   AC rules so, that only the node's parent in the topology structure is
   allowed to send notifications to it. There are three predefined event
   types sent within the notify message(see section 4.1.4). All the
   received notifications MUST be forwarded to children unless they are
   historical.

4.2.8 Maintenance

   Apart from the necessity to transfer a topic to the new root in some   
   situations, there is also the nodes' failures problem that has to be
   handled by the Customizable Algorithm component. To address this
   issue, we define a keep-alive indication. Every node periodically
   sends this message to its direct children. If some peer is the other
   one's parent for several topics, it does not have to send a separate
   indication for each one of them. Such message contains the
   information about the current parent and the list of the 'backup
   nodes' to be placed in the node's cache for each topic. When the
   child detects its parent's failure, it uses the cache to resubscribe.
   If the cache size is set to 0 by the Algorithm Configurator
   component, the default Customizable Algorithm assumes, that the
   keep-alive message does not carry any additional information and
   treats the notify indication as a 'keep-alive', like Scribe does.
   This way, if events are frequently published for the specified
   topics, no additional traffic associated with the topology structure
   maintenance is involved. This optimization mechanism can be 
   considered for the DHT-based networks, where the recovery procedure
   may be performed at a relatively low cost using the overlay-specific
   routing. In general there are three types of caches stored for each
   topic: parents cache, grandparents cache and neighbors cache. The
   capacities of the caches are the parameters k (for the parents and 
   neighbors) and g (for the grandparents). For the node N at the level
   x, parents cache contains k nodes with the lowest id or the closest
   to the topic id from the level x-1. It may also contain the node's
   direct parent. The neighbor cache contains k nodes with the lowest id
   or the closest to the topic id from the level x, which have the same
   parent as N. The grandparents cache contains one node from each level
   between x-2 and x-1-g. This cache is stored in case of the multiple

   nodes' failures in the highly unbalanced trees. When all the nodes
   from the parents cache fail to respond or the cache is empty - the
   node can try to send 'subscribe' request directly to its grandparent.
   All the nodes at the same level and in the same subtree have the same
   caches' contents. Nodes in the different subtrees have different
   neighbors caches' contents. All the entries in the parents and
   neighbors caches are sorted from the lowest id (or distance to the
   topic id) to the highest. In the grandparents cache the node from the
   highest level is stored at the lowest index. Examples of the topology
   structures and caches' contents for both the unstructured and
   DHT-based networks are shown in the figures 4.2.8.1 and 4.2.8.2.

               Figure 4.2.8.3: Example of the grandparents cache usage 
                          (algorithm parameters:  k=2 and g=2)

   After discovering the direct parent's failure, node tries to send the  
   'subscribe' request to the the first node from its parents cache. If
   it does not respond,  it is removed from the cache, and the
   'subscribe' request is sent to the next one. If all the nodes from
   the parents cache fail to respond, the grandparents cache is used. If
   the grandparents cache does not contain any useful information and
   the node's distance to the topic ID is greater than 0, than peer
   assumes that it participates in the DHT-based network and there may
   be some node which ID is closer to the topic ID than its own one. In
   such case it encapsulates the 'transfer topic' request inside the P2P
   insert message. If this message is received by some other node, it
   performs a standard topic transfer procedure. If the peer is already
   participating in the topology structure, than it only omits creating
   the new topic. If the distance between the topic ID and the peer ID
   is lower than 0, than node assumes, that it is participating in an
   unstructured network and cannot rely on the overlay routing
   algorithm. In such case the neighbor cache's contents are examined.
   If it does not provide any useful information or this node is the
   first one on the list, the subscriber performs the lookup procedure
   for the  SUBSCRIPTIONINFO objects associated with the same topic. If
   it finds any nodes with the ID lower than its own one, than it must
   send the subscribe message to the one with the lowest ID. If there
   are no such nodes in the P2P network, than it assumes that it is the
   new topic root and waits for the other nodes to send 'subscribe'
   requests to it. These procedures guarantee the cycles avoidance.
   Moreover they work both for the multicast tree and star topology.

4.3 Message formats

   All the message formats described in this section are used by the
   default Customizable Algorithm component. However they MAY be
   extended by the user-defined ones if it is necessary and registered
   by a different Algorithm Configurator object. In general there are
   three types of messages: requests, indications and responses. Node
   receiving the first one always sends response to the message
   originator. Both requests and responses contain the unique

   identifier of the transaction, they are associated with. It is
   generated by the request originator, who uses it to find out, which
   operation is received response related to. Indications are messages
   which do not require any response as they are not associated with a
   pending operation.

   Every publish-subscribe message is preceded by the following header:

5. Integrating publish-subscribe with P2PP/RELOAD


5.1 Extending P2PP/RELOAD interfaces

   There are several major differences between some of the P2PP and
   RELOAD requests, we had to consider. P2PP publish allows application
   to insert only one object per request. Single RELOAD store request
   MAY contain several objects with the same resource-id, but different
   kind-id's or data models. It is the same with the P2PP lookup and
   RELOAD fetch requests. To provide the generic interfaces for both
   protocols we decided to use object lists, not single objects in all
   callbacks associated with the requests processing. Due to the
   terminology differences between both protocols we use 'insert' for
   the P2PP publish, and RELOAD store request, and 'lookup' for the P2PP
   lookup and RELOAD fetch request where distinguishing one from another
   is not essential.


5.1.1 Callbacks

   We propose adding several callback methods to the P2PP/RELOAD
   interfaces. They can be used by applications built on top of it not
   only for gathering information about the received messages, but also
   for passing data to the overlay layer. Parameters marked as [in] are
   the ones that are passed to the higher layer by P2PP/RELOAD. These
   marked as [out] are returned to the overlay by the application layer. 

   [TODO: Decide what about applications which do not want to use
   callbacks - default implementation returning true shouldn't be a
   problem, when performance is considered]

   [TODO: Decide, whether signature/certificate checking should be 
   performed before or after the callback invocation (in the second case 
   application layer would have to update the object's signature) and
   whether to invoke callbacks for example if the RELOAD layer already
   knows that the signature is invalid]

   boolean onDeliverRequest([in]Request message, 
                            [in/out]List<GeneralObject> objectList)

   @param message Received P2PP/RELOAD request.

   @param objectList Value interpretation is message type dependent. 

   @return Value interpretation is message type dependent. In general
           'true' means 'continue standard processing', and 'false'
           means 'perform custom operation'. 

   Usually invoked directly after receiving a request and determining
   that this node is message destination. In case of lookup requests -
   after searching for the objects in the peer's resource table
   (figure 5.1.1.1). If node stores the requested objects there, they
   are passed to the higher layer using 'objectList' parameter.
   Higher-layer application may decide to send these objects within the
   lookup response, or pass a different ones using the same parameter.

   After the callback invocation P2PP/RELOAD checks the returned value.
   If this value is 'true' it simply returns objects found in the
   resource table in response (or 'NOT FOUND' message if none of the
   requested objects is stored there). Otherwise response message
   contents depend on the second callback parameter's value (objects
   defined by higher layer are returned to the request originator). This
   MAY be used by the application built on top of P2PP/RELOAD for
   example to create different 'views' of the node's resource table,
   depending on the lookup request originator. Higher layer MAY hide
   object's value from some users or send different values to them.

   Similar procedure is performed after receiving an insert request
   (figure 5.1.1.2) although returned value interpretation is slightly 
   different. When this value is 'true', objects encapsulated inside the
   insert request are simply put into the peer's resource table.
   Otherwise either different objects are inserted or only P2PP/RELOAD
   response is sent. 

   For both insert and lookup requests application layer MAY modify
   object list elements' values or replace them with null. It MUST NOT
   modify resource id, type or data model. For all the request types it
   also MUST NOT alter the object list size.

   Usually invoked directly after receiving a P2PP request (and

   object is not for example cached (or replicated) here. If such object

   is found, P2PP/RELOAD passes it to the higher layer using the
   'objectList' parameter. Higher-layer application may decide to send
   this object within the P2PP lookup response, or pass a different one
   using the same parameter. After the callback invocation P2PP/RELOAD
   checks the returned value. If this value is 'true' it simply forwards
   the message or returns the cached/replicated objects in a standard
   response. Otherwise the message is discarded, and P2PP/RELOAD 
   response containing objects defined by the higher layer is sent.

   Figure 5.1.1.4 shows the procedure performed in case of receiving 
   insert request. If the returned value is 'true', the message is 
   forwarded. Otherwise node discards the message and sends insert 
   response to its originator.

   For both insert and lookup requests application layer MAY modify the
   object list elements' values or replace them with null. It MUST NOT
   modify the resource id, type or data model. For all request types it
   also MUST NOT alter the object list size.

5.1.2 Objects

   We propose creating a MESSAGE object type. This object could be used
   by the higher-layer applications to encapsulate its own messages

Adamska, et al.         Expires October 13, 2009              [Page 45]

   within an insert request and make use of the overlay-specific
   routing. In the DHT-based networks this enables sending a message
   even if the exact destination's peer ID is unknown (we only know,
   that it should be the closest one to some given object key). It also
   guarantees that the message will not be routed to clients (as they
   are not responsible for storing objects).  
 
   This object for P2PP could be described as follows:

   Type: MESSAGE
   Subtype: value indicating protocol
   Message: raw message bytes

   Below we propose the MESSAGE object's format using RELOAD semantics:

   Kind-Id: MESSAGE
   Data Model: single value
   Value: value indicating protocol
          raw message bytes

   The received MESSAGE objects do not necessarily have to be stored in
   the resource tables. Application built on top of P2PP/RELOAD MAY
   prevent it by capturing insert messages containing such objects using
   previously described callbacks and making overlay layer discard them.
   After that, the request originator SHOULD also use the previously
   described onDeliverResponse callback to prevent P2PP/RELOAD layer
   from republishing the object and thus resending the higher-layer
   message encapsulated in it.


5.1.3 API

   We propose adding a method for calculating distance between the two
   given keys according to the overlay-specific metrics and hash
   algorithm. In our algorithm we use it for creating and maintaining
   the topology structure. This method could be defined as follows:

   int getDistance(String key1, String key2)

   @param key1, key2 Method calculates the distance between these keys.

   @return In the DHT-based networks returned value is greater or equal
           to 0. In unstructured ones method always returns -1.

   Publish-subscribe protocols built on top of the unstructured
   overlays, based for instance on random walks, may also require access
   to the routing information. This is why we propose two methods that
   provide it:

   RoutingTable getRoutingTable()

   @return Node's routing table.


   NeighborTable getNeighborTable()

   @return Node's neighbor table.


5.2 Usage of the extension


5.2.1 Objects

   Apart from the generic MESSAGE object we also propose to add one
   publish-subscribe-specific type called  SUBSCRIPTIONINFO. It will be
   placed in network to inform other nodes about the topic existence,
   and help them join the multicast tree. This is essential for the 
   unstructured overlays.

   For P2PP this object can be defined as follows:

   Type = SUBSCRIPTIONINFO
   Status = PENDING/ACCEPTED
   Peer = PeerInfo object containing peer ID, IP address and port number
          for the incoming publish-subscribe messages.


   Below we propose the SUBSCRIPTIONINFO object's format using RELOAD
   semantics:

   Kind-Id: SUBSCRIPTIONINFO
   Data Model: single value
   Value: status = PENDING/ACCEPTED
          peer = PeerInfo object containing peer ID, IP address and port
                 number for the incoming publish-subscribe messages.

   When node wants to subscribe for some topic, it performs lookup for
   the SUBSCRIPTIONINFO object (giving the topic ID as a key).


6. Future work

   We plan to provide event metadata to extend the default Interest
   Conditions and support advanced filters for the content-based
   multicast.
