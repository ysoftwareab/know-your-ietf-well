                           VPIM Addressing           October 22, 2001 
1. Introduction 
    
This document lists the various VPIM email address formats that are 
currently in common use and defines several new address formats for 
special case usage.   Requirements are imposed on the formats of 
addresses used in VPIM submission mode 
        
   [VPIM2] does not place any restrictions on the email address format. 
   However, it does recommend the use of a numeric LHS since many 
   legacy voice mail systems only use digits to identify mailboxes. 
   Further, it recommends a structure to handle private, international 
   and extensions. The private format has become deployed in most 
   existing VPIM v2 systems, further some systems will only accept 
   messages from addresses with a numeric LHS.  
    
   [IVM] does not describe addressing at all. The LHS format is left to 
   the discretion of the mailbox owner. However, it is useful in some 
   cases (like submission or tunneling) to specify a LHS format. A 
   format based on GSTN addressing [GSTN] is presented.  
    
   This document defines the various recipient (i.e., TO) addresses for 
   VPIM and IVM messages. 
    
    
2. Conventions used in this document 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119. 
    
   "LHS" as used in this document is to be interpreted as the left side 
   of the "@" in an email address.  It is defined as "local-part" in 
   RFC-822. 
    
3. VPIM v2 Addressing 
    
   This is defined in section 4.1.1 of [VPIM2] & [VPIMV2R2].  Of the 
   four groups of addresses defined, the mailbox number format is the 
   most commonly used in VPIM v2 systems.   
    
               Example:  6137637582@nortelnetworks.com 
 
    
4. VPIM Addressing 
 
   VPIM places no restrictions on the form of the Internet address. 
   VPIM systems must be capable of receiving an arbitrary email address 
   and generating a reply to that address. No inferences about the 
   structure of the local part (LHS) should be necessary.  
           
   Recipients email addresses must be created in a form compatible with 
   the recipients system and consistent with the address entry 
   capabilities of a telephone user interface. 
    
   The following sections use formal syntax compliant with RFC 2234, 
   "Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF".

                           VPIM Addressing           October 22, 2001 
4.1 VPIM Submission LHS   
           
   Limited capability voice mail machines may send messages by default 
   to an external message submission gateway.  These gateways will 
   convert the unresolved telephone number of the recipient into a 
   legitimate email address.  Messages requiring address resolution 
   must be sent to a submission system which will convert the submitted 
   address into the route-able email address.   
    
   Additionally, limited capability email systems may send messages to 
   a VPIM onramp system indicated on the RHS. The LHS would indicate 
   that the message is to be sent as a VPIM message to the telephone 
   number indicated. In this case, address and message translation is 
   performed by the gateway.  
           
   Telephone numbers sent in a VPIM submission mode MUST be sent in one 
   of the following forms.  
           
   This is based on the format defined in [GSTN-ADDR] and extensions in 
   [GSTN].  
    
           
4.1.1 The VPIM address  
    
   For voice messages that are intended to be sent as VPIM messages the  
   service-selector element is defined to be: 
    
   vpim-service-selector = "VPIM"  
    
   The resultant vpim-address and vpim-mbox are formally  
           
   vpim-address = vpim-mbox  
                 [ pstn-recipient ]  
           
   vpim-mbox = [ "VPIM=" ] ( global-phone / local-phone )  
               [ sub-addr-spec ext-addr-spec dl-addr-spec]  
    
   dl-addr-spec = "/DL=" sub-addr  
                         ;note that "/DL=" is case INSENSITIVE              
   ext-addr-spec = [ ext-sep sub-addr ]  
   ext-sep = ( "/EXT=" / "+" )  
                         ; note that "/EXT=" is case INSENSITIVE  
                         ; "+" is used for compatibility with current  
                         ; VPIM v2 addressing  
           
   For clarity, here is an example of a very simple vpim-mbox:  
        VPIM=6137637582  
    
   The extension syntax, that is a phone number followed by "/EXT=" 
   defining the extension, would be used where the mailbox does not 
   have a direct dial number associated with it (e.g., typically behind 
   a non-ISDN PBX).   For example: 
    
        VPIM=7035255550/EXT=227 
    
   The distribution list syntax, that is a phone number followed by 
   "/DL=" defining the list, would be used to refer to a distribution 
   list associated with the phone number (with or without an 
   extension).  For example:

        VPIM=+14165977230/DL=93  
    
           
           
4.1.2 The Voice address  
           
   For voice messages that are intended to be sent as a voice 
   outdialing at the destination system, the service-selector element 
   is defined to be:       
    
   voice-service-selector = "VOICE"  
           
   The resultant voice-address and voice-mbox are formally  
           
   voice-address = voice-mbox  
                  [ pstn-recipient ]  
           
   voice-mbox = "VOICE=" ( global-phone / local-phone )  
                      [ sub-addr spec ] [post-sep post-dial]  
           
   For more clarity, here is an example of a very simple voice-mbox:  
           
   VOICE=+3940226338  
           
           
4.1.3 The AMIS address  
           
   For voice messages that are intended to be sent as AMIS (Audio 
   Messaging Interchange Specification) voice mail messages, the 
   service-selector element is defined to be:   
    
   amis-service-selector = "AMIS"  
           
   The resultant amis-address and amis-mbox are formally  
           
   amis-address = amis-mbox  
          
   amis-mbox = "AMIS=" amis-mailbox   
               [ "/SYSNUM=" amis-sysnum ]  
               ; note that "/SYSNUM=" is case INSENSITIVE  
           
   amis-mailbox = ( amis-a / amis-d )  
           
   amis-a = amis-a-number  
           
   amis-d = [ amis-mailbox-numberplan ][ "+" ] amis-mailbox-id   
               [ "+" ] [ amis-mailbox-extension ]  
               ; The "+" separators are used to be compatible   
               ; the X.400 AMIS-D mailbox definition --   
               ; if more than one element is present, both  
               ; "+" must appear.  Note also that the total  
               ; length of this field is restricted to 32  
               ; characters by AMIS-D.  
           
   amis-mailbox-numberplan = 1*VCHAR  
           
   amis-mailbox-id = 1*16(VCHAR)

                      ; separators of AMIS-A  
       
   amis-private-number = "0++" local-number "+"  
                      ; [AMIS-A] indicates that maximum permitted  
                      ; length of the private number is 14   
                      ; digits  
           
   int-country-code = 1*4(DIGIT)  
                 
   area-code = 1*(DIGIT)  
                 
   local-number = 1*(DIGIT)  
           
   For more clarity, here is an example of a simple AMIS-A amis-mbox:  
           
   AMIS=+1/401+3278144+/SYSNUM=1+401+3279542+  
    
           
4.1.4 The fax address  
           
   Fax addresses used in VPIM are formatted as defined in [FAX-
   ADDR],section 2. 
    
    
4.2 VPIM Submission Addresses  
              
   Based on [GSTN-ADDR], these are the resultant email addresses for 
   the LHS presented above.  VPIM and IVM  systems that support 
   submission MUST accept, translate (if necessary), and forward 
   messages sent to these addresses.   
                
           
4.2.1 The vpim-email  
               
   The vpim-email element is a specific version of pstn-email for VPIM 
   over the Internet e-mail transport system, where the service-
   selector distinction is set to "VPIM". 
    
   vpim-email =  ["/"] vpim-address ["/"] "@" mta-I-pstn  
                
   In this case the mta-I-pstn will usually point to a VPIM capable   
   messaging system where the attached message will be delivered 
   properly.

4.2.2 The voice-email  
               
   The voice-email element is a specific version of pstn-email for the 
   voice outdialing over the Internet e-mail transport system, where 
   the service-selector distinction is set to "VOICE".  
    
   voice-email =  ["/"] voice-address ["/"] "@" mta-I-pstn  
                
   In this case the mta-I-pstn will usually point to a device that will 
   perform an outdial, that is for example, make a telephone call to 
   the specified number and play a voice attachment.  
                
           
4.2.3 The amis-email  
           
   The amis-email element is a specific version of pstn-email for the 
   AMIS over the Internet e-mail transport system, where the service-
   selector distinction is set to "AMIS".  
    
   amis-email =  ["/"] amis-address ["/"] "@" mta-I-pstn  
                
   In this case the mta-I-pstn will usually point to a device that acts 
   as a gateway to an AMIS network where the attached voice message 
   will be delivered properly.              
           
 
4.2.4 The fax-email  
                
   Fax email addresses used in VPIM are formatted as defined in [FAX-
   ADDR], section 4. 
    
    
    
5. Security Considerations 
 
   Most security considerations are already identified in [VPIM2] and 
   [IVM].  
    
   An additional concern would be that the sender must trust and also 
   be aware of the policies of the submission MTA to which the message 
   is submitted.  This is because, that MTA will make the determination 
   of where the final destination is and how it will be delivered based 
   on the VPIM submission LHS.  
    
   Submission MTAs should take care to not blindly place outdial calls 
   to any number submitted (e.g., international numbers or "1-900" 
   numbers).  Ideally, senders should be authenticated to confirm their 
   outdialing privileges.
