ABSTRACT
   This document describes the terminology for benchmarking Interior 
   Gateway Protocol (IGP) Route Convergence.   The terminology is to 
   be used for benchmarking IGP convergence time through externally 
   observable (black box) data plane measurements.  The terminology 
   can be applied to any link-state IGP, such as ISIS and OSPF.

1. Introduction
   This draft describes the terminology for benchmarking Interior 
   Gateway Protocol (IGP) Route Convergence.  The motivation and 
   applicability for this benchmarking is provided in [Po07a].  The 
   methodology to be used for this benchmarking is described in [Po07m].  
   The methodology and terminology to be used for benchmarking Route 
   Convergence can be applied to any link-state IGP such as ISIS [Ca90] 
   and OSPF [Mo98].  The data plane is measured to obtain black-box 
   (externally observable) convergence benchmarking metrics.  The 
   purpose of this document is to introduce new terms required to 
   complete execution of the IGP Route Convergence Methodology [Po07m].  
   These terms apply to IPv4 and IPv6 traffic and IGPs.

                 Link-State IGP Data Plane Route Convergence

   An example of Route Convergence as observed and measured from the 
   data plane is shown in Figure 1.  The graph in Figure 1 shows 
   Forwarding Rate versus Time.  Time 0 on the X-axis is on the far 
   right of the graph.  The Offered Load to the ingress interface of 
   the DUT SHOULD equal the measured maximum Throughput [Ba99][Ma98]
   of the DUT and the Forwarding Rate [Ma98] is measured at the egress 
   interfaces of the DUT.   The components of the graph and the metrics 
   are defined in the Term Definitions section.

3. Term Definitions
   3.1 Convergence Event
        
        Definition:
        The occurrence of a planned or unplanned event in the network 
        that results in a change in the egress interface of the Device
        Under Test (DUT) for routed packets.

        Discussion:
        Convergence Events include link loss, routing protocol session 
        loss, router failure, configuration change, and better next-hop
        learned via a routing protocol.

        Measurement Units:
        N/A

        Issues:        
        None

        See Also:
        Convergence Packet Loss
        Convergence Event Instant

   3.2 Route Convergence

        Definition:
        The action to update all components of the router with the 
        most recent route change(s) including the Routing 
        Information Base (RIB) and Forwarding Information Base (FIB), 
        along with software and hardware tables, such that forwarding 
        is successful for one or more route entries.

        Discussion:
        Route Convergence MUST occur after a Convergence Event.
        Route Convergence can be observed externally by the rerouting
        of data traffic to the Next-best Egress Interface.  Also,
        completion of Route Convergence may or may not be sustained 
        over time.

        Measurement Units:
        N/A

        Issues:
        None

INTERNET-DRAFT           Benchmarking Terminology for     February 2008
                 Link-State IGP Data Plane Route Convergence

   3.3 Full Convergence

        Definition:
        Route Convergence for an entire FIB in which complete recovery 
        from the Convergence Event is indicated by the DUT Throughput 
        equal to the offered load.

        Discussion:
        When benchmarking convergence, it is useful to measure
        the time to converge an entire FIB.  For example,
        a Convergence Event can be produced for an OSPF table of 
        5000 routes so that the time to converge routes 1 through 
        5000 is measured.  Completion of Full Convergence is externally 
        observable from the data plane when the Throughput of the data 
        plane traffic on the Next-Best Egress Interface equals the 
        offered load.  Full Convergence may or may not be sustained over 
        time.  The Sustained Convergence Validation Time MUST be 
        applied.

   3.4 Network Convergence  

        Definition:
        The process of updating of all routing tables, including 
        distributed FIBs, in all routers throughout the network.

        Discussion:
        Network Convergence requires completion of all Route 
        Convergence operations for all routers in the network following 
        a Convergence Event.  Completion of Network Convergence can be 
        observed by recovery of System Under Test (SUT) Throughput to 
        equal the offered load, with no Stale Forwarding, and no 
        Blenders [Ca01][Ci03].

        Measurement Units:
        N/A

        Issues:
        None

  3.5 Route-Specific Convergence

        Definition:
        Route Convergence for one or more specific route entries in 
        the FIB in which recovery from the Convergence Event is 
        indicated by data-plane traffic for a flow [Po06] matching that 
        route entry(ies) being routed to the Next-Best Egress Interface.

        Discussion:
        When benchmarking convergence, it is sometimes useful to 
        measure the time to converge a single flow [Po06] or group of 
        flows to benchmark convergence time for one or a few route 
        entries in the FIB instead of the entire FIB.  Route-Specific 
        Convergence of a flow is externally observable from the data 
        plane when the data plane traffic for that flow is routed to 
        the Next-Best Egress Interface.

        N/A

   3.6  Packet Loss

        Definition:
        The number of packets that should have been forwarded
        by a DUT under a constant offered load that were 
        not forwarded due to lack of resources.

        Discussion:
        Packet Lss is a modified version of the term "Frame Loss Rate" 
        as defined in [Ba91].  The term "Frame Loss" is intended for 
        Ethernet Frames while "Packet Loss" is intended for IP packets.  
        Packet Loss can be measured as a reduction in forwarded traffic 
        from the Throughput [Ba91] of the DUT. 

        Measurement units:
        Number of offered packets that are not forwarded. 

        Issues:  None

        See Also:

   3.7 Convergence Packet Loss

        Definition:
        The number of packets lost due to a Convergence Event
        until Full Convergence completes.

        Discussion:
        Convergence Packet Loss includes packets that were lost and 
        packets that were delayed due to buffering.  The Convergence 
        Packet Loss observed in a Packet Sampling Interval may or may 
        not be equal to the number of packets in the offered load 
        during the interval following a Convergence Event (see Figure 
        1).

        number of packets

   3.8 Convergence Event Instant

        Definition:
        The time instant that a Convergence Event becomes observable in 
        the data plane.

        Discussion:
        Convergence Event Instant is observable from the data 
        plane as the precise time that the device under test begins 
        to exhibit packet loss.  

        Measurement Units:
        hh:mm:ss:nnn:uuu, 
           where 'nnn' is milliseconds and 'uuu' is microseconds.

   3.9 Convergence Recovery Instant

        Definition:
        The time instant that Full Convergence completion is 
        measured and then maintained for an interval of duration 
        equal to the Sustained Convergence Validation Time.

        Discussion:
        Convergence Recovery Instant is measurable from the data 
        plane as the precise time that the device under test 
        completes Full Convergence.  

        Measurement Units:
        hh:mm:ss:nnn:uuu, 
           where 'nnn' is milliseconds and 'uuu' is microseconds.

   3.10 First Route Convergence Instant

        Definition:
        The time instant a first route entry has converged 
        following a Convergence Event, as observed by receipt of 
        the first packet from the Next-Best Egress Interface.

        Discussion:
        The First Route Convergence Instant is an indication that the 
        process to achieve Full Convergence has begun.  Any route may 
        be the first to converge for First Route Convergence Instant.  
        Measurement on the data-plane enables the First Route 
        Convergence Instant to be observed without any white-box 
        information from the DUT.

   3.11 Convergence Event Transition

        Definition:
        A time interval observed following a Convergence Event in which
        Throughput gradually reduces to a minimum value.

        Discussion:
        The Convergence Event Transition is best observed for Full 
        Convergence.  The egress packet rate observed during a 
        Convergence Event Transition may not decrease linearly and may 
        not decrease to zero.  Both the offered load and the Packet 
        Sampling Interval influence the observations of the Convergence 
        Event Transition.  For example, even if the Convergence Event 
        were to cause the Throughput [Ba91] to drop to zero there would 
        be some number of packets observed, unless the Packet Sampling 
        Interval is exactly aligned with the Convergence Event.  This 
        is further discussed with the term "Packet Sampling Interval".

   3.12 Convergence Recovery Transition

        Definition:
        The characteristic of the DUT in which Throughput gradually 
        increases to equal the offered load.

        Discussion:
        The Convergence Recovery Transition is best observed for 
        Full Convergence.  The egress packet rate observed during
        a Convergence Recovery Transition may not increase linearly.
        Both the offered load and the Packet Sampling Interval
        influence the observations of the Convergence Recovery
        Transition.  This is further discussed with the term 
        "Packet Sampling Interval".

   3.13 Rate-Derived Convergence Time

        Definition:
        The amount of time for Convergence Packet Loss to persist upon 
        occurrence of a Convergence Event until Full Convergence has
        completed.   

        Rate-Derived Convergence Time can be measured as the time 
        difference from the Convergence Event Instant to the 
        Convergence Recovery Instant, as shown with Equation 1.
        
        (Equation 1)  
          Rate-Derived Convergence Time = 
              Convergence Recovery Instant - Convergence Event Instant. 

              
        Discussion:
        Rate-Derived Convergence Time SHOULD be measured at the maximum
        Throughput of the DUT.  At least one packet per route in the FIB 
        for all routes in the FIB MUST be offered to the DUT within the
        Packet Sampling Interval.  
        
        Failure to achieve Full Convergence results in a Rate-Derived 
        Convergence Time benchmark of infinity.  It is RECOMMENDED that 
        the Rate-Derived Convergence Time be measured when benchmarking
        Full Convergence.

   3.14 Loss-Derived Convergence Time

        Definition:
        The amount of time it takes for Full Convergence to be

        Discussion:
        Optimally, the Convergence Event Transition and Convergence 
        Recovery Transition are instantaneous so that the 
        Rate-Derived Convergence Time = Loss-Derived Convergence Time.
        However, router implementations are less than ideal.
        Loss-Derived Convergence Time gives a better than 
        actual result when converging many routes simultaneously
        because it ignores the Convergence Recovery Transition.  
        Rate-Derived Convergence Time takes the Convergence Recovery 
        Transition into account.  Equation 2 calculates the average 
        convergence time over all routes to which packets have been 
        sent. Since this average convergence time is in general 
        smaller than the maximum convergence time over all routes, 
        Loss-Derived Convergence Time is not the preferred metric to
        indicate Full Convergence completion. For this reason the 
        RECOMMENDED benchmark metric for Full Convergence is the 
        Rate-Derived Convergence Time. 

        Guidelines for reporting Loss-Derived Convergence Time are 
        provided in [Po07m].

   3.15 Route-Specific Convergence Time

        Definition:
        The amount of time it takes for Route-Specific Convergence to
        be completed as calculated from the amount of Convergence 
        Packet Loss per flow.

        Route-Specific Convergence Time can be calculated from
        Convergence Packet Loss as shown with Equation 3.

        Equation 3 - 
          Route-Specific Convergence Time =
             Convergence Packets Loss / Offered Load
          where units are packets / packets/second = seconds

        Discussion:

        It is possible to provide an offered load that has flows 
        matching every route entry in the FIB and benchmarking 
        Route-Specific Convergence Time for all route entries.  The 
        number of flows that can be measured is dependent upon the flow 
        measurement capabilities of the Tester.  When benchmarking 
        Route-Specific Convergence, Convergence Packet Loss is measured 
        for specific flow(s) and Equation 3 is applied for each flow.  
        Each flow has a single destination address matching a different 
        route entry.  The fastest measurable convergence time is equal 
        to the time between two consecutive packets of a flow offered 
        by the Tester.  
     
        The Route-Specific Convergence Time benchmarks enable minimum, 
        maximum, average, and median convergence time measurements to be 
        reported by comparing the results for the different route 
        entries.  It also enables benchmarking of convergence time when 
        configuring a priority value for route entry(ies).  Since 
        multiple Route-Specific Convergence Times can be measured it is 
        possible to have an array of results.  The format for reporting 
        Route-Specific Convergence Time is provided in [Po07m].

        The Route-Specific Convergence Time MAY be used to benchmark
        Full Convergence when used in combination with many flows
        matching every FIB entry.

   3.16 First Route Convergence Time

        Definition:
        The amount of time for Convergence Packet Loss until the 
        convergence of a first route entry on the Next-Best Egress 
        Interface, as indicated by the First Route Convergence 
        Instant.

        Discussion:
        The First Route Convergence Time benchmarking metric can be 
        measured when benchmarking either Full Convergence or 
        Route-Specific Convergence.  When benchmarking Full Convergence, 
        First Route Convergence Time can be measured as the time 
        difference from the Convergence Event Instant and the First 
        Route Convergence Instant, as shown with Equation 4a.
        
        (Equation 4a)  
        First Route Convergence Time = 
           First Route Convergence Instant - Convergence Event Instant 
        
        When benchmarking Route-Specific Convergence, First Route 
        Convergence Time can be measured as the minimum Route-Specific 
        Convergence Time, as shown with Equation 4b.

        (Equation 4b)  
        First Route Convergence Time = 
           min(Route-Specific Convergence Time)

        First Route Convergence Time should be measured at the maximum
        Throughput of the DUT.  At least one packet per route in the FIB 
        for all routes in the FIB MUST be offered to the DUT within the
        Packet Sampling Interval.  Failure to achieve the First Route 
        Convergence Instant results in a First Route Convergence Time 
        benchmark of infinity.

        Convergence is maintained without additional packet loss.

                 Link-State IGP Data Plane Route Convergence

        Discussion:
        The purpose of the Sustained Convergence Validation Time is to 
        produce Convergence benchmarks protected against fluctuation 
        in Throughput after the completion of Full Convergence is 
        observed.  The RECOMMENDED Sustained Convergence Validation 
        Time to be used is 5 seconds.

   3.18 Reversion Convergence Time
        Definition:
        The amount of time for the DUT to complete Full Convergence 
        to the Preferred Egress Interface, instead of the Next-Best 
        Egress Interface, upon recovery from a Convergence Event.

        Discussion:
        Reversion Convergence Time is the amount of time for Full
        COnvergence to the original egress interface.  This is 
        achieved by recovering from the Convergence Event, such as 
        restoring the failed link.  Reversion Convergence Time is 
        measured using the Rate-Derived Convergence Time calculation 
        technique, as provided in Equation 1.  It is possible to have 
        the Reversion Convergence Time differ from the Rate-Derived 
        Convergence Time.

        Definition:

        measurements for arriving packet flows.

        Discussion: 
        At least one packet per route in the FIB 
        for all routes in the FIB MUST be offered to the DUT within the
        Packet Sampling Interval.  Metrics measured at the Packet 
        Sampling Interval MUST include Forwarding Rate and Convergence 
        Packet Loss.

        Measurement Units:
        seconds

        Issues:        
        Packet Sampling Interval can influence the Convergence Graph.
        This is particularly true when implementations complete Full 
        Convergence in less than the Packet Sampling Interval.  The 
        Convergence Event Transition and Convergence Recovery Transition 
        can become exaggerated when the Packet Sampling Interval is too 
        long.  This will produce a larger than actual Rate-Derived 
        Convergence Time.  The recommended value for configuration of 
        the Packet Sampling Interval is provided in [Po07m].

        Discussion:
        Stale Forwarding can be caused by a Convergence Event and can 
        manifest as a "black-hole" or microloop that produces packet 
        loss.  Stale Forwarding can exist until Network Convergence is 
        completed.  Stale Forwarding cannot be observed with a single 
        DUT.
