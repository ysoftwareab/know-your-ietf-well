Internet-Draft          NETCONF Monitoring Schema          November 2008


Abstract

   This document defines NETCONF content via XML Schema to be used to
   monitor the NETCONF protocol.  The monitoring data model includes
   information about NETCONF sessions, locks, and subscriptions and is
   intended to facilitate management of a NETCONF server.  In addition
   this monitoring data provides clients with standardized content to
   describe supported schema.

   Today, NETCONF capabilities exchange is the only standardized method
   a client can use to discover the functionality supported by a NETCONF
   server.  This works well for static protocol capabilities but is not
   well suited for capabilities which could change during a session.

   Considerations such as different schema formats, feature optionality
   and access controls can all impact the applicability and level of
   detail the NETCONF server sends to a client during session setup.
   Through updated monitoring data NETCONF clients can adjust their
   capabilities throughout a session.  Specifically the details returned
   can be used by a client to determine whether retrieval of new schema
   information is required and includes the information required to
   facilitate the retrieval.

   A new RPC (get-schema) is also defined to support explicit schema
   retrieval via NETCONF.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines NETCONF content via [XMLSchema] to be used to
   monitor the NETCONF protocol.  It provides information about NETCONF
   sessions and subscriptions.

1.1.  Definition of Terms

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Operation:  This term is used to refer to NETCONF protocol
      operations.  Specifically within this document, operation refers
      to NETCONF protocol operations defined in support of NETCONF
      monitoring.

   Schema:  This term is used to refer to a data model fragment,
      independent of which data modeling language is used in the data
      model.

   Subscription:  A concept related to the delivery of notifications (if
      any to send) involving destination and selection of notifications.
      It is bound to the lifetime of a session.

   XML Schema:  The W3C XML Schema [XMLSchema] data modeling language.

   YANG:  YANG is a data modeling language used to model configuration
      and state data manipulated by the NETCONF protocol, NETCONF remote
      procedure calls, and NETCONF notifications.

   The following data allows a NETCONF client to monitor both the
   NETCONF server itself and the associated network device operational
   data.  The specific monitoring data defined in this draft which MUST
   be present follows.

2.1.  netconf


  Root of the monitoring data model.  Acts as container for the other
  monitored data.

     |_schemas
     |_sessions
     |_subscriptions
     |_statistics

  capabilities (type:  xs:anyURI)
    List of NETCONF capabilities supported by the server.

  configurations (type:  ConfigurationDatastore)
    List of NETCONF datastores on the server.
    Includes all supported datastore types (running, candidate, startup)

  schemas (type:  SchemaEntry)
    List of schemas supported on the server.
    Includes all the information required to identify the schema and
    to support its retrieval.

2.1.1.  capabilities

   The list of capabilities supported by the NETCONF server.  The list
   MUST include all capabilities exchanged during session setup still
   applicable at the time of the request.  This ensures consistency with
   the initial capabilities exchanged while allowing for potential
   modifications during a session.

2.1.2.  configurations

  Configuration data pertaining to the NETCONF server.

  configuration (type:  ConfigurationDataStore)
       |_name
       |_locks

  name (type: NETCONFDatastoreType)
     Enumeration of supported datastores; candidate, running, startup.

  locks (type:  ManagementSessionLock)
     Contains current lock information for the datastores.  Global and
     partial locks are supported as either a single global lock or
     multiple partial locks per datastore.

     Both a global lock and a partial lock MUST contain the sessionId
     and time the lock was acquired.  The lockedNodes is the list of
     actual nodes which were locked at the the selection was evaluated.
     This is provided for completeness noting that the list of nodes
     returned by the selection may differ over time.

     Additionally partial lock items will contain both the selection
     and the list of lockedNodes.  The selection is the xpath expression
     which was used to evaluate the list of nodes to lock.

2.1.3.  schemas

      |_version      (key)
      |_format       (key)
      |_namespace
      |_location

  The elements identifier, version, and format are used as a key in the
  schema list.  They are also used in the <get-schema> RPC.

  identifier (type: xs:string)
    Identifier for the schema list entry.  Typically the module name or
    filename of the schema.  It is also used in the <get-schema>
    RPC and may be used for other means.

  version (type:  xs:string)
    Version of the schema supported.  Multiple versions MAY be supported
    simultaneously by a NETCONF server.  Each MUST be reported
    individually in the schema list, i.e. with same identifier, possibly
    different location, but different version.

  format (type: SchemaFormat)
    The data modeling language of the file/module.  Current selection of
    XSD, YANG, and RNG.

  namespace(type: xs:anyURI)
    The XML namespace defined by the data model.

  location (union type:  xs:string, xs:anyURI)
    A location from which this specific schema, format, and version can
    be retrieved.

    At least one schema entry SHOULD be available to support retrieval.

    A schema entry may be located on a network device (eg: xs:anyURI),
    (eg: xs:string reference to file system for ftp retrieval) or
    available explicitly via NETCONF (xs:string value 'NETCONF') for
    NETCONF servers which support the schema-retrieval capability via
    <get-schema>.

3.  Schema Specific Operations

3.1.  New NETCONF RPC, <get-schema>

   Description: When the schema is available on the device and the
   client wishes to have it returned via NETCONF this new RPC operation
   is used.

   Parameters:

   identifier (type: xs:string): Identifier for the schema list entry.
   Typically the module name or filename of the schema.

   version (type: xs:string): Version of the schema supported.

   format (type: SchemaFormat): The data modeling language of the file/
   module.

   Example: Query a specific schema on device using <get-schema>
   operation


   <rpc message-id="101"
        xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
     <get-schema xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:state">
       <identifier>foo</identifier>
       <version>v1</version>
       <format>XSD</format>
     </get-schema>
   </rpc>

   The NETCONF server returns the XML schema (XSD).

   <rpc-reply message-id="101"
              xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
     <data><![CDATA[
       <xs:schema
         <!-- Contents of foo schema would be returned here -->
       </xs:schema>]]>
     </data>
   </rpc-reply>

3.2.  NETCONF Schema List Retrieval (<get> monitoring data)

   A NETCONF client retrieves the list of supported XML Schema from a
   NETCONF server using the <get> RPC request.  The list of available
   XML Schema is retrieved by requesting the <schema> subtree via a
   <get> operation.  Available schema for the requesting session are

   returned in the reply containing the <identifier> ,<version> and
   <location> elements.  Since the same schema may be supported in
   multiple locations and/or have multiple versions and/or multiple
   formats no particular attribute is unique.  An empty reply is
   returned if there are no available schema.

   The response data can be used to determine the available schema and
   their versions.  The schema itself (ie. schema content) is not
   returned in the response.  The details returned in the list SHOULD
   facilitate retrieval from a network location via a URL using a
   supported mechanism on the device such as ftp or http.i

   Additionally the ability to retrieve a schema via NETCONF SHOULD be
   supported.  When a schema is available on the device and the schema-
   retrieval capability is supported by the NETCONF server a location
   value of 'NETCONF' MUST be used to indicate that it can be retrieved
   via NETCONF using the <get-schema> RPC described in section 3.1.

           <schemas/>
         </netconf>
       </filter>
     </get>
   </rpc>

   The NETCONF server returns a list of data models available for
   retrieval.

4.2.  Retrieving schema instances

   Given the reply in the previous section, the following examples
   illustrate the availability of 'foo', 'bar', and 'bar-types' schema
   at multiple locations, with multiple formats, and in multiple
   locations.

     1.  foo,  version 1.0 in XSD format:

       a.  Via FTP using location
           ftp://ftp.example.com/schemas/foo_1.0.xsd

       b.  Via HTTP using location
           http://www.example.com/schema/foo/1.0.xsd

       c.  Via <get-schema> using identifier, version, and

           The domainName type represents a DNS domain
           name. The name SHOULD be fully qualified
           whenever possible.

           The description clause of objects using the
           domainName type MUST describe how (and when)
           these names are resolved to IP addresses.

           Note that the resolution of a domainName value
           may require to query multiple DNS records (e.g.,
           A for IPv4 and AAAA for IPv6).  The order of the
           resolution process and which DNS record takes
           precedence depends on the configuration of the
           resolver.

6.  Security Considerations

   The NETCONF monitoring schema as defined in this document provides
   information about a NETCONF system that could be used to aid an
   attack on that system.  Care should be taken to restrict access to
   this information as appropriate.

7.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to the NETCONF working group for providing a much earlier
   draft of Schema to manage NETCONF and NETCONF Notifications that were
   cannibalized to produce this draft.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document will require new URIs for the NETCONF XML namespace in
   the IETF XML registry [RFC3688].  Following the format in RFC 3688,
   the following registrations require consideration.

 +----------------------+----------------------------------------------+
 | Index                | Capability Identifier                        |
 +----------------------+----------------------------------------------+
 | :netconf-monitoring  | urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:          |
 |                      | netconf-monitoring:1.0                       |
 |                      |                                              |
 | :schema-retrieval    | urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:          |
 |                      | schema-retrieval:1.0                         |
 +----------------------+----------------------------------------------+

   Note, the proposed capability URNs are also compliant to section 10.3
   of NETCONF [RFC4741].
