         Experimental DMARC Extension For Public Suffix Domains
                        draft-ietf-dmarc-psd-15

Abstract

   Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance
   (DMARC) permits a domain-controlling organization to express domain-
   level policies and preferences for message validation, disposition,
   and reporting, which a mail-receiving organization can use to improve
   mail handling.

   DMARC distinguishes the portion of a name that is a Public Suffix
   Domain (PSD), below which organizational domain names are created.
   The basic DMARC capability allows organizational domains to specify
   policies that apply to their subdomains, but it does not give that
   capability to PSDs.  This document describes an extension to DMARC to
   fully enable DMARC functionality for PSDs.

   Some implementations of DMARC consider a PSD to be ineligible for
   DMARC enforcement.  This specification addresses that case.

1.  Introduction

   DMARC [RFC7489] provides a mechanism for publishing organizational
   policy information to email receivers.  DMARC allows policy to be
   specified for both individual domains and for organizational domains
   and their sub-domains within a single organization.

   To determine the organizational domain for a message under
   evaluation, and thus where to look for a policy statement, DMARC
   makes use of a public suffix list.  The process for doing this can be
   found in Section 3.2 of the DMARC specification.  Currently, the
   public suffix list being used is the most common one that is
   maintained by the Mozilla Foundation and made public at
   http://publicsuffix.org [1].

   In the basic DMARC model, Public Suffix Domains (PSDs) are not
   organizational domains and are thus not subject to DMARC processing.
   In DMARC, domains fall into one of three categories: organizational
   domains, sub-domains of organizational domains, or PSDs.  A PSD can
   only publish DMARC policy for itself, and not for any sub-domains
   under it.  In some cases, this limitation allows for the abuse of
   non-existent organizational-level domains and hampers identification
   of domain abuse in email.

   This document specifies experimental updates to the DMARC
   specification cited above, in an attempt to mitigate this abuse.

1.1.  Example

   As an example, imagine a Top-Level Domain (TLD), ".example", that has
   public subdomains for government and commercial use (".gov.example"
   and ".com.example").  The maintainer of a list of such a PSD
   structure would include entries for both of these sub-domains,
   thereby indicating that they are PSDs, below which organizational
   domains can be registered.  Suppose further that there exists a
   legitimate domain called "tax.gov.example", registered within
   ".gov.example".

   However, by exploiting the typically unauthenticated nature of email,
   there are regular malicious campaigns to impersonate this

   organization that use similar-looking ("cousin") domains such as
   "t4x.gov.example".  Such domains are not registered.

   Within the ".gov.example" public suffix, use of DMARC has been
   mandated, so "gov.example" publishes the following DMARC DNS record:

   _dmarc.gov.example. IN TXT ( "v=DMARC1; p=reject;"
                                "rua=mailto:dmc@dmarc.svc.gov.example" )

   This DMARC record provides policy and a reporting destination for
   mail sent from @gov.example.  Similarly, "tax.gov.example" will have
   a DMARC record that specifies policy for mail sent from addresses
   @tax.gov.example.  However, due to DMARC's current method of
   discovering and applying policy at the organizational domain level,
   the non-existent organizational domain of @t4x.gov.example does not
   and cannot fall under a DMARC policy.

   Defensively registering all variants of "tax" is not a scalable
   strategy.  The intent of this specification, therefore, is to enhance
   the DMARC discovery method by enabling an agent receiving such a
   message to be able to determine that a relevant policy is present at
   "gov.example", which is precluded by the current DMARC specification.

1.2.  Discussion

   This document provides a simple extension to [RFC7489] to allow
   operators of Public Suffix Domains (PSDs) to:

   o  Express policy at the level of the PSD that covers all
      organizational domains that do not explicitly publish DMARC
      records

   o  Extends the DMARC policy query functionality to detect and process
      such a policy

   o  Describes receiver feedback for such policies

   o  Provides controls to mitigate potential privacy considerations
      associated with this extension

   This document also provides a new DMARC tag to indicate requested
   handling policy for non-existent subdomains.  This is provided
   specifically to support phased deployment of PSD DMARC, but is
   expected to be useful more generally.  Undesired rejection risks for
   mail purporting to be from domains that do not exist are
   substantially lower than for those that do, so the operational risk
   of requesting harsh policy treatment (e.g., reject) is lower.

   As an additional benefit, the PSD DMARC extension clarifies existing
   requirements.  Based on the requirements of [RFC7489], DMARC should
   function above the organizational level for exact domain matches
   (i.e., if a DMARC record were published for "example", then mail from
   example@example should be subject to DMARC processing).  Testing had
   revealed that this is not consistently applied in different
   implementations.

   There are two types of Public Suffix Operators (PSOs) for which this
   extension would be useful and appropriate:

   o  Branded PSDs (e.g., ".google"): These domains are effectively
      Organizational Domains as discussed in [RFC7489].  They control
      all subdomains of the tree.  These are effectively private
      domains, but listed in the current public suffix list.  They are
      treated as Public for DMARC purposes.  They require the same
      protections as DMARC Organizational Domains, but are currently
      unable to benefit from DMARC.

   o  Multi-organization PSDs that require DMARC usage (e.g., ".bank"):
      Because existing Organizational Domains using this PSD have their
      own DMARC policy, the applicability of this extension is for non-
      existent domains.  The extension allows the brand protection
      benefits of DMARC to extend to the entire PSD, including cousin
      domains of registered organizations.

   Due to the design of DMARC and the nature of the Internet email
   architecture [RFC5598], there are interoperability issues associated
   with DMARC deployment.  These are discussed in Interoperability
   Issues between DMARC and Indirect Email Flows [RFC7960].  These
   issues are not typically applicable to PSDs, since they (e.g., the
   ".gov.example" used above) do not typically send mail.

2.  Terminology and Definitions

   This section defines terms used in the rest of the document.

2.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.2.  Public Suffix Domain (PSD)

   The global Internet Domain Name System (DNS) is documented in
   numerous RFCs.  It defines a tree of names starting with root, ".",
   immediately below which are Top Level Domain names such as ".com" and
   ".us".  The domain name structure consists of a tree of names, each
   of which is made of a sequence of words ("labels") separated by
   period characters.  The root of the tree is simply called ".".  The
   Internet community at large, through processes and policies external
   to this work, selects points in this tree at which to register domain
   names "owned" by independent organizations.  Real-world examples are
   ".com", ".org", ".us", and ".gov.uk".  Names at which such
   registrations occur are called Public Suffix Domains (PSDs), and a
   registration consists of a label selected by the registrant to which
   a desirable PSD is appended.  For example, "ietf.org" is a registered
   domain name, and ".org" is its PSD.

2.3.  Organizational Domain

   The term Organizational Domains is defined in [RFC7489] Section 3.2.

2.4.  Longest PSD

   The longest PSD is the Organizational Domain with one label removed.
   It names the immediate parent node of the Organizational Domain in
   the DNS namespace tree.

2.5.  Public Suffix Operator (PSO)

   A Public Suffix Operator is an organization which manages operations
   within a PSD, particularly the DNS records published for names at and
   under that domain name.

2.6.  PSO Controlled Domain Names

   PSO Controlled Domain Names are names in the DNS that are managed by
   a PSO and are not available for use as Organizational Domains.  PSO
   Controlled Domain Names may have one (e.g., ".com") or more (e.g.,
   ".co.uk") name components, depending on PSD policy.

2.7.  Non-existent Domains

   For DMARC purposes, a non-existent domain is a domain for which there
   is an NXDOMAIN or NODATA response for A, AAAA, and MX records.  This
   is a broader definition than that in [RFC8020].

3.  PSD DMARC Updates to DMARC Requirements

   To participate in this experiment, implementations should interpret
   RFC7489 as follows:

3.1.  General Updates

   References to "Domain Owners" also apply to PSOs.

3.2.  Changes in Section 6.3 "General Record Format"

   If this experiment is successful, this paragraph is added to this
   section.  A new tag is added after "fo":

   np:  Requested Mail Receiver policy for non-existent subdomains
      (plain-text; OPTIONAL).  Indicates the policy to be enacted by the
      Receiver at the request of the Domain Owner.  It applies only to
      non-existent subdomains of the domain queried and not to either
      existing subdomains or the domain itself.  Its syntax is identical
      to that of the "p" tag defined below.  If the "np" tag is absent,
      the policy specified by the "sp" tag (if the "sp" tag is present)
      or the policy specified by the "p" tag, if the "sp" tag is not
      present, MUST be applied for non-existent subdomains.  Note that
      "np" will be ignored for DMARC records published on subdomains of
      Organizational Domains and PSDs due to the effect of the DMARC
      policy discovery mechanism described in DMARC Section 6.6.3.

   The following tag definitions from DMARC are updated:

   p: The sentence 'Policy applies to the domain queried and to
      subdomains, unless subdomain policy is explicitly described using
      the "sp" tag' is updated to read 'Policy applies to the domain
      queried and to subdomains, unless subdomain policy is explicitly
      described using the "sp" or "np" tags.'

   sp:  The sentence 'If absent, the policy specified by the "p" tag
      MUST be applied for subdomains' is updated to read 'If both the
      "sp" tag is absent and the "np" tag is either absent or not
      applicable, the policy specified by the "p" tag MUST be applied
      for subdomains.

3.3.  Changes in Section 6.4 "Formal Definition"

   The ABNF for DMARC shall updated to include a new definition "dmarc-
   nprequest" which is defined as:






Kitterman & Wicinski    Expires December 16, 2021               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                  PSD DMARC                      June 2021


               dmarc-nprequest =  "np" *WSP "=" *WSP
                   ( "none" / "quarantine" / "reject" )


   The "dmarc-record" definition is also updated to include the
   following:

                 [dmarc-sep dmarc-nprequest]

3.4.  Changes in Section 6.5 "Domain Owner Actions"

   In addition to the DMARC domain owner actions, PSOs that require use
   of DMARC and participate in PSD DMARC ought to make that information
   available to receivers.  This document is an experimental mechanism
   for doing so.  See the [this document] experiment description
   (Appendix A).

3.5.  Changes in Section 6.6.1 "Extract Author Domain"

   Experience with DMARC has shown that some implementations short-
   circuit messages, bypassing DMARC policy application, when the domain
   name extracted by the receiver (from the RFC5322.From) is on the
   public suffix list used by the receiver.  This negates the capability
   being created by this specification.  Therefore, the following
   paragraph is appended to Section 6.6.1 of DMARC:

   Note that domain names that appear on a public suffix list are not
   exempt from DMARC policy application and reporting.

3.6.  Changes in Section 6.6.3 "Policy Discovery"

   A new step between step 3 and 4 is added:

   3A.  If the set is now empty and the longest PSD (Section 2.4) of the
      Organizational Domain is one that the receiver has determined is
      acceptable for PSD DMARC (discussed in the [this document]
      experiment description (Appendix A)), the Mail Receiver MUST query
      the DNS for a DMARC TXT record at the DNS domain matching the
      [this document] longest PSD (Section 2.4) in place of the
      RFC5322.From domain in the message (if different).  A possibly
      empty set of records is returned.

   As an example, for a message with the Organizational Domain of
   "example.compute.cloudcompany.com.example", the query for PSD DMARC
   would use "compute.cloudcompany.com.example" as the [this document]
   longest PSD (Section 2.4).  The receiver would check to see if that
   PSD is listed in the DMARC PSD Registry, and if so, perform the
   policy lookup at "_dmarc.compute.cloudcompany.com.example".

Internet-Draft                  PSD DMARC                      June 2021


   Note: Because the PSD policy query comes after the Organizational
   Domain policy query, PSD policy is not used for Organizational
   domains that have published a DMARC policy.  Specifically, this is
   not a mechanism to provide feedback addresses (RUA/RUF) when an
   Organizational Domain has declined to do so.

3.7.  Changes in Section 7 "DMARC Feedback"

   If this experiment is successful, this paragraph is added to this
   section.

   Operational note for PSD DMARC: For PSOs, feedback for non-existent
   domains is desirable and useful, just as it is for org-level DMARC
   operators.  See Section 4 of [this document] for discussion of
   Privacy Considerations for PSD DMARC.

4.  Privacy Considerations

   These privacy considerations are developed based on the requirements
   of [RFC6973].  Additionally, the Privacy Considerations of [RFC7489]
   apply to the mechanisms described by this document.  If this
   experiment is successful, this section should be incorporated into
   the Privacy Considerations section as "Feedback leakage".

   Providing feedback reporting to PSOs can, in some cases, cause
   information to leak out of an organization to the PSO.  This leakage
   could potentially be utilized as part of a program of pervasive
   surveillance (See [RFC7624]).  There are roughly three cases to
   consider:

   o  Single Organization PSDs (e.g., ".google"), RUA and RUF reports
      based on PSD DMARC have the potential to contain information about
      emails related to entities managed by the organization.  Since
      both the PSO and the Organizational Domain owners are common,
      there is no additional privacy risk for either normal or non-
      existent Domain reporting due to PSD DMARC.

   o  Multi-organization PSDs that require DMARC usage (e.g., ".bank"):
      PSD DMARC based reports will only be generated for domains that do
      not publish a DMARC policy at the organizational or host level.
      For domains that do publish the required DMARC policy records, the
      feedback reporting addresses (RUA and RUF) of the organization (or
      hosts) will be used.  The only direct feedback leakage risk for
      these PSDs are for Organizational Domains that are out of
      compliance with PSD policy.  Data on non-existent cousin domains
      would be sent to the PSO.

Internet-Draft                  PSD DMARC                      June 2021


   o  Multi-organization PSDs (e.g., ".com") that do not mandate DMARC
      usage: Privacy risks for Organizational Domains that have not
      deployed DMARC within such PSDs are significant.  For non-DMARC
      Organizational Domains, all DMARC feedback will be directed to the
      PSO.  PSD DMARC is opt-out (by publishing a DMARC record at the
      Organizational Domain level) instead of opt-in, which would be the
      more desirable characteristic.  This means that any non-DMARC
      organizational domain would have its feedback reports redirected
      to the PSO.  The content of such reports, particularly for
      existing domains, is privacy sensitive.

   PSOs will receive feedback on non-existent domains, which may be
   similar to existing Organizational Domains.  Feedback related to such
   cousin domains have a small risk of carrying information related to
   an actual Organizational Domain.  To minimize this potential concern,
   PSD DMARC feedback MUST be limited to Aggregate Reports.  Feedback
   Reports carry more detailed information and present a greater risk.

   Due to the inherent Privacy and Security risks associated with PSD
   DMARC for Organizational Domains in multi-organization PSDs that do
   not participate in DMARC, any Feedback Reporting related to multi-
   organizational PSDs MUST be limited to non-existent domains except in
   cases where the reporter knows that PSO requires use of DMARC (by
   checking the DMARC PSD Registry).

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not change the Security Considerations of
   [RFC7489] and [RFC7960].

   The risks of the issues identified in [RFC7489], Section 12.3, DNS
   Security, are amplified by PSD DMARC.  In particular, DNS cache
   poisoning (or Name Chaining), see [RFC3833] for details, consequences
   are increased because a successful attack would potentially have a
   much wider scope.

   The risks of the issues identified in [RFC7489], Section 12.5,
   External Reporting Addresses, are amplified by PSD DMARC.  By design,
   PSD DMARC causes unrequested reporting of feedback to entities
   external to the Organizational Domain.  This is discussed in more
   detail in Section 4.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This section describes actions requested to be completed by IANA.

6.1.  Subdomain Policy Tag

   IANA is requested to add a new tag to DMARC Tag Registry in the
   Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance
   (DMARC) Parameters Registry.  The "Status" column is defined in
   [RFC7489]Section 11.4.

   The entry is as follows:

   +----------+-----------+---------+-------------------------------+
   | Tag Name | Reference | Status  | Description                   |
   +----------+-----------+---------+-------------------------------+
   | np       | this      | current | Requested handling policy for |
   |          | document  |         | non-existent subdomains       |
   +----------+-----------+---------+-------------------------------+

   [RFC EDITOR: Please replace "This document" with the RFC number of
   this document.]

Appendix A.  PSD DMARC Privacy Concern Mitigation Experiment

   The experiment being performed has three different questions which
   are looking to be addressed in this document.

   o  Section 3.2 modifies policy discovery to add an additional DNS
      lookup.  To determine if this lookup is useful, PSDs will add
      additional DMARC records in place, and will analyze the DMARC
      reports.  Success will be determined if a consensus of PSDs that
      publish DMARC records are able to collect useful data.

Internet-Draft                  PSD DMARC                      June 2021


   o  Section 3.2 adds the "np" tag for non-existent subdomains (DNS
      NXDOMAIN).  PSOs wishing to test this will add this flag to their
      DMARC record, and will analyze DMARC reports for deployment.
      Success will be determined if organizations find explicitly
      blocking non-existent subdomains domains desirable and provide
      added value.

   o  Section 4.1 discusses three cases where providing feedback could
      cause information to leak out of an organization.  This experiment
      will analyze the feedback reports generated for each case to
      determine if there is information leakage.

Appendix B.  DMARC PSD Registry Examples

   To facilitate experimentation around data leakage mitigation, samples
   of the DNS based and IANA like registries are available at
   [psddmarc.org].

B.1.  DMARC PSD DNS Query Service

   A sample stand-alone DNS query service is available at
   [psddmarc.org].  It was developed based on the contents suggested for
   an IANA registry in an earlier revision of this draft.  Usage of the
   service is described on the web site.

B.2.  DMARC Public Suffix Domain (PSD) Registry

   [psddmarc.org] provides an IANA like DMARC Public Suffix Domain (PSD)
   Registry as a stand-alone DNS query service.  It follows the contents
   and structure described below.  There is a Comma Separated Value
   (CSV) version of the listed PSD domains which is suitable for use in
   build updates for PSD DMARC capable software.

   PSDs that are deploying DMARC and are participating in PSD DMARC must
   register their public suffix domain in this new registry.  The
   requirement has to be documented in a manner that satisfies the terms
   of Expert Review, per [RFC8126].  The Designated Expert needs to
   confirm that provided documentation adequately describes PSD policy
   to require domain owners to use DMARC or that all domain owners are
   part of a single organization with the PSO.

   The initial set of entries in this registry is as follows:

B.3.  DMARC PSD PSL Extension

   [psddmarc.org] provides a file formatted like the Public Suffix List
   (PSL) in order to facilitate identification of PSD DMARC
   participants.  Contents are functionally identical to the IANA like
   registry, but presented in a different format.

   When using this approach, the input domain of the extension lookup is
   supposed to be the output domain of the regular PSL lookup, i.e., the
   organizational domain.  This alternative data approach is potentially
   useful since DMARC implementations already need to be able to parse
   the data format, so it should be easier to implement.

Appendix C.  Implementations

   There are two known implementations of PSD DMARC available for
   testing.

C.1.  Authheaders Module

   The authheaders Python module and command line tool is available for
   download or installation from Pypi (Python Packaging Index).

   It supports both use of the DNS based query service and download of
   the CSV registry file from [psddmarc.org].

C.2.  Zdkimfilter Module

   The zdkimfilter module is a separately available add-on to Courier-
   MTA.

   Mostly used for DKIM signing, it can be configured to also verify,
   apply DMARC policies, and send aggregate reports.  For PSD DMARC it
   uses the PSL extension list approach, which is available from
   [psddmarc.org]
