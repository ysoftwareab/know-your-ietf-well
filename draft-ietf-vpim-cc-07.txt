1. Abstract 
    
   This document describes the use of a mechanism for identifying body 
   parts that a sender deems critical in a multi-part Internet mail 
   message.  The mechanism described is a parameter to Content-
   Disposition, as described by RFC 3204. 
    
   By knowing what parts of a message the sender deems critical, a 
   content gateway can intelligently handle multi-part messages when 
   providing gateway services to systems of lesser capability.  
   Critical content can help a content gateway to decide what parts to 
   forward.  It can indicate how hard a gateway should try to deliver a 
   body part.  It can help the gateway to pick body parts that are safe 
   to silently delete when a system of lesser capability receives a 
   message.  In addition, critical content can help the gateway chose 
   the notification strategy for the receiving system.  Likewise, if 
   the sender expects the destination to do some processing on a body 
   part, critical content allows the sender to mark body parts that the 
   receiver must process.

                  Critical Content of Internet Mail         June 2002 
 
 
    
   NOTE: Notes, such as this one, provide additional nonessential 
   information that the reader may skip without missing anything 
   essential.  The primary purpose of these non-essential notes is to 
   convey information about the rationale of this document, or to place 
   this document in the proper historical or evolutionary context.  
   Readers whose sole purpose is to construct a conformant 
   implementation may skip such information.  However, it may be of use 
   to those who wish to understand why we made certain design choices. 
    
    
3. Introduction 
    
   The specification of Critical Content is small and compact.  For the 
   benefit of developers, the specification comes first, the rationale 
   after. 
    
   One concept that an implementer must understand is the content 
   gateway.  Section 9 describes the content gateway.  In brief, a 
   content gateway has knowledge of the receiving system's 
   capabilities.  The content gateway passes messages the receiving 
   system can process, render or store.  The content gateway can modify 
   a message, for example by deleting unrenderable or storable body 
   parts, for delivery to the receiving system.  Finally, the content 
   gateway can reject a message that the receiving system cannot 
   handle. 
    
   In this document, the "sending agent" is the originator of the 
   message.  It could be a mail user agent (MUA) for an Internet 
   message, or a SIP User Agent Client (UAC) for a SIP [3] message. 
    
    
   NOTE: This document updates RFC 3204 to separate the Handling 
   parameter from the ISUP/QSIG transport mechanism.  The protocol 
   described here is identical in functionality to RFC 3204 with 
   respect to SIP.  Future versions of RFC 3204 should reference this 
   document for the Handling parameter, as it is orthogonal to the 
   tunneling of signaling. 
    
    
    
4. Handling Parameter 
    
   The Handling parameter is a Content-Disposition [5] parameter 
   inserted by the sending agent to indicate to the content gateway 
   whether to consider the marked body part critical. 
    
   A REQUIRED body part is one the sender requires the receiving system 
   to deliver for him to consider the message delivered. 
    
   An OPTIONAL body part is one the sender doesn't care whether the 
   receiving system delivers it or not.  A content gateway can silently

                  Critical Content of Internet Mail         June 2002 
 
 
   delete such body parts if the receiving system cannot deliver the 
   part. 
    
   The terms "entity" and "body part" have the meanings defined in [5]. 
    
4.1. REQUIRED 
    
   "Handling=REQUIRED" signifies that this body part is critical to the 
   sender. 
    
   If the content gateway cannot pass a body part marked REQUIRED, then 
   the entire message has failed.  In this case, the content gateway 
   MUST take the appropriate failure action. 
    
   NOTE: We say "appropriate action", because the sender may have 
   suppressed all notifications.  In this case, the appropriate action 
   is to silently discard the message.  In addition, as a general MIME 
   parameter, the MIME body part may not be in an Internet Mail 
   message.  Moreover, in the SIP case, the appropriate notification is 
   a status return code, not a delivery notification. 
    
4.2. OPTIONAL 
    
   "Handling=OPTIONAL" signifies that the sender does not care about 
   notification reports for this body part. 
    
   If the content gateway cannot pass a body part marked OPTIONAL, the 
   receiving system may silently delete the body part.  The receiving 
   system MUST NOT return a delivery failure, unless parts marked 
   REQUIRED have also failed. 
    
4.3. Default Values 
    
   The default value for Handling for a given body part is REQUIRED.  
   This enables the existing notification mechanisms to work for 
   sending agents that do not know about the content notification 
   entity.  All body parts are critical, because they have the default 
   marking of REQUIRED. 
    
   NOTE: In the case of Internet mail, critical content processing is a 
   function of the content gateway and not the mail transfer agent 
   (MTA) or user agent (UA).  Often, the entity performing content 
   gateway processing is the receiving UA.  However, in this case the 
   UA is acting as a content gateway.  Thus the default action for any 
   Content-Disposition [5]-compliant user agent to ignore unrecognized 
   disposition parameters ensures that this mechanism is compatible 
   with the Internet architecture. 
    
   NOTE: This parameter is fully backwards compatible and works as 
   expected for Internet mail and SIP.

                  Critical Content of Internet Mail         June 2002 
 
 
   NOTE: Some VPIMv2 implementations can receive arbitrary e-mail from 
   the Internet.  However, these systems are really acting in the 
   capacity of an Internet Voice Mail system.  In this case, one would 
   expect the implementation to provide Internet Voice Mail semantics 
   to Internet Voice Mail messages. 
    
4.4. Other Values 
    
   The content gateway MUST treat unrecognized values as REQUIRED.  
   This is to provide backward compatibility with future uses of the 
   Content-Criticality entity. 
    
   NOTE: A possible new value is IMPORTANT.  An IMPORTANT body part is 
   something the sender wants the receiver to get, but would not want 
   the message rejected outright if the IMPORTANT body part fails, but 
   they do want notification of the failure.  However, as no 
   implementations do IMPORTANT, it is not important to this version of 
   this document. 
    
    
5. Collected Syntax 
    
   The format of the collected syntax is in accordance with the ABNF of 
   [6].  Note that per RFC 2183 [5], the HANDLING Content-Disposition 
   parameter is not case sensitive.  In addition, the notification-type 
   is not case sensitive. 
    
        "handling" "=" notification-type CRLF 
    
        notification-type = "REQUIRED" / "OPTIONAL" / 
                            other-handling / generic-param 
    
        other-handling    =  token 
    
    
    
6. Notification 
    
   One obvious application of critical content is generating a 
   (non-)delivery notification in the Internet mail environment.  If 
   the value of the field is OPTIONAL, the content gateway MUST NOT 
   generate a notification.  If the value of the field is REQUIRED, the 
   content gateway MAY generate a notification, based on the normal 
   notification request mechanisms.  Normal notification request 
   mechanisms include the SMTP RCPT NOTIFY command [7] and the 
   Disposition-Notification-To header [8]. 
    
   In SIP, all requests have responses.  These responses provide 
   notification in the status code of the response.  For the RFC 3204 
   case, a content gateway generates a 415 (Unsupported Media Type) 
   response if the field is REQURED.

                  Critical Content of Internet Mail         June 2002 
 
 
   If the sending system requests a notification, and a REQUIRED part 
   fails, the content gateway will generate a notification for the 
   whole message.  Conversely, if the gateway cannot pass on a body 
   part marked OPTIONAL, the gateway will not generate a notification.  
    
   NOTE: This implies that the content gateway must examine the entire 
   message to determine whether it needs to generate a notification.  
   However, the content gateway need not examine the message if it 
   knows it can store and forward all media types.  Said differently, 
   Internet e-mail MTAs or gateways can, by default, handle any 
   arbitrary MIME-encapsulated type.  Some voice mail systems, on the 
   other hand, cannot store binary attachments at all, such as 
   application/ms-word.  The voice mail content gateway, in this 
   example, would be scanning for non-renderable body parts in any 
   event.  
     
6.1. DSN vs. MDN Generation 
    
   The content gateway generates a delivery status notification (DSN) 
   [8] if it operates as a gateway.  The content gateway generates a 
   Message Disposition Notification (MDN) [9] if it operates as a mail 
   user agent.  Section 7 describes the operating modes of a content 
   gateway.  In short, if there is a MTA that "delivers" the message to 
   the content gateway for processing, the MTA takes responsibility for 
   DSN processing.  In this case, the only option available to the 
   content gateway is to generate MDNs.  If the content gateway 
   operates as a MTA, then it generates DSNs.  DSN generation is the 
   preferred option. 
    
   If the content gateway is part of a SIP endpoint, then it generates 
   the appropriate success or error response code. 
    
    
6.2. Summary 
    
   The following table summarizes the actions expected of a conforming 
   content gateway. 
    
   NOTE: This section is normative: it suggests what to put into the 
   DSN or MDN.  
    
   NOTE: In the case of SIP, this section is informative.  See RFC 3204 
   for the normative set of actions on failure.

                            |---------------------+----------------| 
                            |      REQUIRED       |    OPTIONAL    | 
       +--------------------+---------------------+----------------+

       | Undeliverable      | Fail Entire Message |     ignore     | 
       +--------------------+--------------------------------------+ 
    
    
   The "Appropriate Action" is the action the content gateway would 
   take given the context of execution.  For example, if a sender 
   requests return receipt and the receiver reads a HANDLING body part, 
   the receiving UA must generate the appropriate MDN (following the 
   rules for MDN).  Likewise, if the content gateway cannot deliver the 
   body part and the body part is critical, the content gateway 
   generates the appropriate DSN or MDN.  
    
   "Optional" means the content gateway ignores the disposition of the 
   body part.  The content gateway treats the message as if the body 
   part was not present in the message. 
    
    
7. Status Code 
    
   The critical content indication, in itself, does not guarantee any 
   notification.  Notification follows the rules described in [3], [7], 
   and [8]. 
    
   NOTE: The content of actual DSNs or MDNs are beyond the scope of 
   this document.  This document only specifies how to mark a critical 
   body part.  On the other hand, we do envision sensible DSN and MDN 
   contents.  For example, DSNs should include the appropriate failure 
   code as enumerated in [10].  Likewise, MDNs should include the 
   failure code in the MDN "Failure:" field. 
    
   If the receiving system is to generate a notification based on its 
   inability to render or store the media type, the notification should 
   use the status code 5.6.1, "Media not supported", from [9]. 
    
   For the SIP case, all requests have notification provided by the 
   status response message.  Per RFC 3204, a content gateway generates 
   a 415 (Unsupported Media Type) response.

8. Requirements for Critical Content 
    
8.1. Needs 
    
   The need for a critical content identification mechanism comes about 
   because of the internetworking of Internet mail systems with 
   messaging systems that do not fulfill all of the semantics of 
   Internet mail.  Such legacy systems have a limited ability to render 
   or store all parts of a given message.  This document will use the 
   case of an Internet mail system exchanging electronic messages with 
   a legacy voice messaging system for illustrative purposes. 
    
   Electronic mail has historically been text-centric.  Extensions such 
   as MIME [11] enable the user agents to send and receive multi-part, 
   multimedia messages.  Popular multimedia data types include binary 
   word processing documents, binary business presentation graphics, 
   voice, and video. 
    
   Voice mail has historically been audio-centric.  Many voice-
   messaging systems only render voice.  Extensions such as fax enable 
   the voice mail system to send and receive fax images as well as 
   create multi-part voice and fax messages.  A few voice mail systems 
   can render text using text-to-speech or text-to-fax technology.  
   Although theoretically possible, none can today render video. 
    
   An important aspect of the interchange between voice messaging 
   services and desktop e-mail client applications is that the 
   rendering capability of the voice-messaging platform is often much 
   less than the rendering capability of a desktop e-mail client.  In 
   the e-mail case, the sender has the expectation that the recipient 
   receives all components of a multimedia message.  This is so even if 
   the recipient cannot render all body parts.  In most cases, the 
   recipient can either find the appropriate rendering tool or tell the 
   sender that she cannot read the particular attachment. 
    
   This is an important issue.  By definition, a MIME-enabled user 
   agent, conforming to [12], will present or make available all of the 
   body parts to the recipient.  However, a voice mail system may not 
   be capable of storing non-voice objects.  Moreover, the voice mail 
   system may not be capable of notifying the recipient that there were 
   undeliverable message parts. 
    
   The inability of the receiving system to render a body part is 
   usually a permanent failure.  Retransmission of the message will not 
   improve the likelihood of a future successful delivery.  Contrast 
   this with the case with normal data delivery.  Traditional message 
   failures, such as a garbled message or disabled link will benefit 
   from retransmission. 
    
   This situation is fundamentally different from normal Internet mail.  
   In the Internet mail case, either the system delivered the message, 

  
Burger                  Expires December 2002                [Page 8] 
 

                  Critical Content of Internet Mail         June 2002 
 
 
   or it didn't.  There is no concept of a system partially delivering 
   a message. 
    
   In addition, there are many situations where the sender would not 
   mind if the system did not deliver non-critical parts of a message.  
   For example, the sender's user agent may add body parts to a message 
   unbeknownst to the sender.  If the receiving system rejected the 
   message because it could not render a hidden body part, the sender 
   would be understandably confused and upset. 
    
   Thus, there is a need for a method of indicating to a Mail Transfer 
   Agent (MTA) or User Agent (UA) that the sender considers parts of a 
   message to be critical.  From the sender's perspective, he would not 
   consider the message delivered if the system did not deliver the 
   critical parts. 
    
8.2. Current Approaches 
    
   One method of indicating critical content of a message is to define 
   a profile.  The profile defines rules for silently deleting mail 
   body parts based on knowledge of the UA capabilities.  Citing the 
   example above, a voice profile can easily declare that MTAs or UAs 
   can silently delete TNEF data and yet consider the message 
   successfully delivered.  This is, in fact, the approach taken by 
   VPIMv2 [13]. 
    
   Since one aspect of the issue is deciding when to notify the sender 
   that the system cannot deliver part of a message, one could use a 
   partial non-delivery notification mechanism to indicate a problem 
   with delivering a given body part.  However, this requires the user 
   request a delivery notification.  In addition, the sender may not be 
   aware of parts added by the sending user agent.  In this case, a 
   failure notice would mystify the sender. 
    
   A straightforward alternative implementation method for marking a 
   body part critical is to use a Critical-Content MIME entity.  This 
   has the benefit that criticality is meta information for the body 
   part.  However, IMAP servers in particular would need to either put 
   Critical-Content into the BODYSTRUCTURE method or create a new 
   method to retrieve arbitrary MIME entities.  Given the experience of 
   trying to get Content-Location accepted by IMAP vendors, we chose 
   not to go that route. 
    
   What we need is a way of letting the sender indicate what body-parts 
   he considers to be critical.  The mechanism must not burden the 
   sender with failure notifications for non-critical body parts.  The 
   mechanism must conform to the general notification status request 
   mechanism for positive or negative notification.  When requested, 
   the mechanism must indicate to the sender when a receiving system 
   cannot deliver a critical body part.

9. The Content Gateway 
    
   In this section, we use the definition of [14] for the term 
   "gateway." 
    
   A content gateway is a gateway that connects a first network to a 
   second network.  The second network often has lesser capability than 
   the first network.  The canonical topology follows.  "[MTA]", with 
   square brackets, signifies an optional component. 
    
                             +---------+ 
   +---------+     +-----+   |         |     +-------+   +-----------+ 
   | Sending |=...=|[MTA]|===| Content |=...=| [MTA] |===| Receiving | 
   |   UA    |     +-----+   | Gateway |     +-------+   |    UA     | 
   +---------+               |         |                 +-----------+ 
                             +---------+ 
          First Network                         Second Network 
    
    
   The content gateway can be the last hop before the receiving MTA.  
   The content gateway can be between networks, and thus not the last 
   hop before the receiving MTA.  The content gateway can be the first 
   MTA the sending UA contacts.  Finally, the content gateway can be an 
   integrated component of the receiving MTA. 
    
   For the SIP case, consider each MTA as a SIP Proxy, the Sending UA 
   as a SIP User Agent Client, and the Receiving UA as a SIP User Agent 
   Server. 
    
    
9.1. Integrated Content Gateway 
    
   In this situation, the receiving user agent is integrated with the 
   content gateway. The integrated content gateway knows the 
   capabilities of the user agent.  The topology is as follows. 
    
                             +---------------------+ 
   +---------+     +-----+   |         :           | 
   | Sending |=...=|[MTA]|===| Content : Receiving | 
   |   UA    |     +-----+   | Gateway :    UA     | 
   +---------+               |         :           | 
                             +---------------------+ 
          First Network           Second Network 
    
    
   The processing of ISUP and QSIG objects, as described in [4], is an 
   example of an integrated gateway.

9.2. Disaggregated Delivery Network 
    
   A degenerate case, although one that does occur, is where the 
   content gateway sits behind the final MTA.  This happens when one 
   implements the content gateway as a post-processing step to a normal 
   delivery.  For example, one could configure a mail handling system 
   to deliver the message to a queue or directory, where the content 
   gateway process picks up the message.  If there were any directives 
   for DSN processing, the delivering MTA would execute them.  For 
   example, the message could have requested notification on successful 
   delivery.  The delivering MTA, having delivered the message to the 
   queue, would consider the message delivered and thus notify the 
   sender of such.  However, the content gateway process could then 
   discover that the receiving UA cannot render the message.  In this 
   case, the content gateway generates a NDN, as it is the only option 
   available. 
    
                           Delivered 
                               |      +---------+ 
   +---------+     +-----+     v      |         |     +-----------+ 
   | Sending |=...=| MTA |--> File -->| Content |=...=| Receiving | 
   |   UA    |     +-----+            | Gateway |     |    UA     | 
   +---------+                        |         |     +-----------+ 
                                      +---------+ 
          First Network              Second Network 
    
    
    
10. Backward Compatibility Considerations 
    
   DSN requires ESMTP.  If MTAs in the path from the sending UA to the 
   receiving UA do not support ESMTP, then that MTA will reject the DSN 
   request.  In addition, the message will default to notification on 
   delay or failure.  While not ideal, the sender will know that DSN is 
   not available, and that critical content that fails will get 
   notification. 
    
    
11. MIME Interactions 
    
11.1. multipart/alternative 
    
   As is true for all Content-Disposition parameters, handling is only 
   in effect for the selected alternative.  If the selected alternative 
   has the critical content indicator, then the entire alternative 
   takes on the criticality indicated.  That is, if the alternative 
   selected has HANDLING=OPTIONAL, then the content gateway MUST NOT 
   generate any delivery notifications. 
    
   NOTE: This statement explicitly shows that HANDLING overrides the 
   DSN and MDN request mechanisms.

                  Critical Content of Internet Mail         June 2002 
 
 
   It is unlikely for a selected alternative to fail, as the content 
   gateway presumably picks the alternative specifically because it can 
   render it.  
    
   If the selected alternative is a message/rfc822 that encloses a 
   multipart MIME message or the selected alternative is itself a 
   multipart MIME type, the individual top-level body parts follow the 
   HANDLING mechanism described in this document. 
    
   NOTE: This means that a forwarded message's criticality will not 
   affect the forwarding agent's intentions. 
    
11.2. multipart/related 
    
   Criticality fits in rather well with the multipart/related 
   construction.  For example, consider a multipart/related message 
   consisting of a Macintosh data fork and a Macintosh resource fork.  
   For a Microsoft Word document, the data fork is likely to be 
   critical.  The receiving system can safely ignore the resource fork. 
    
11.3. message/rfc822 
    
   Criticality only affects the outermost level of the message or, in 
   the case of multipart/alternative, the outermost level of the 
   selected alternative.  Specifically, the receiving system ignores 
   criticality indicators in embedded body parts.  This avoids the 
   situation of a forwarded message triggering or suppressing undesired 
   reporting.  This simply implements the procedures described in [5]. 
    
    
12. Implementation Examples 
    
   This section is not a normative part of the definition of 
   Criticality.  However, we hope it helps implementers to understand 
   the mechanics of the Handling mechanism. 
    
   We will examine two cases.  They are how a content gateway processes 
   a message and how a disaggregated content gateway processes a 
   message. 
    
12.1. Content Gateways 
    
   Content gateways examine the contents of a message from a first 
   network before the gateway forwards the message to a second network.  
   For the purposes of this example, we assume the second network has 
   less capability than the first network.  In particular, we expect 
   there will be certain message body types that the gateway cannot 
   pass onto the second network. 
    
   Consider a gateway between the Internet and a text-only short 
   message service.  A message comes through the gateway containing a 
   text part and a tnef part.  The sender marks the text part REQUIRED.

                  Critical Content of Internet Mail         June 2002 
 
 
   The gateway, knowing the capability of the short message service, 
   silently deletes the non-critical, tnef part, passing the critical 
   content to the short message service network.  Any subsequent 
   notifications, such as failure notices or delivery notices, follow 
   the normal rules for notification. 
    
   Note the gateway, by silently deleting non-critical content, may 
   affect proprietary message correlation schemes.  One can envision 
   the sending UA inserting a body part for tracking purposes.  By 
   deleting non-critical content, the content gateway will break such a 
   scheme.  If a sending UA understands how to mark critical content, 
   it should use Internet standard mechanisms for tracking messages, 
   such as Message-ID [15]. 
    
   What if no body parts have critical content indicators?  In this 
   case, the entire message is critical.  Thus, when the gateway sees 
   the tnef part, it will reject the entire message, generating a DSN 
   with a status code 5.6.1, "Media not supported". 
    
   Likewise, consider a three part message with a text annotation (part 
   1) to a voice message (part 2) with a vCard [16] (part 3).  The 
   sender marks the first two parts REQUIRED.  Now, let us assume the 
   receiving MTA (gateway) is a voice mail only system, without even 
   the capability to store text.  In this case, the gateway, acting as 
   the receiving MTA, will reject the message, generating a DSN with 
   the status code 5.6.1, "Media not supported". 
    
12.2. Disaggregated Content Gateway 
    
   For this example, we will examine the processing of a three-part 
   message.  The first part is a text annotation of the second part, an 
   audio message.  The third part is the sender's vCard.  The sender 
   marks the first and second parts REQUIRED.  In addition, the sender 
   marks the message for read receipt. 
    
   For the purposes of example, the telephone user interface (TUI) does 
   not perform text-to-speech conversion.  A TUI is a mail user agent 
   (UA) that uses DTMF touch-tone digits for input and audio for output 
   (display). 
    
   The TUI is unable to render the first part of the message, the text 
   part.  In addition, it is unable to render the third part of the 
   message, the vCard part.  Since the sender did not mark the third 
   part of the message REQUIRED, the system ignores the failure of the 
   TUI to render the third part of the message.  However, since the 
   sender did mark the first part REQUIRED, and the TUI is unable to 
   render text, the message fails. 
    
   What happens next is implementation dependent.  If the TUI is part 
   of a unified messaging system, a reasonable action is to hold the 
   message for the user.  The user can access the message at a later 
   time from a terminal that can render all of the critical body parts.

                  Critical Content of Internet Mail         June 2002 
 
 
   It would be reasonable for the TUI to notify the user about the 
   undeliverable body part. 
    
   If the TUI is part of a voice messaging system, or if the user does 
   not subscribe to a text-to-speech service, a reasonable action is 
   for the TUI to return a MDN with the disposition "failed" and the 
   failure modifier "5.6.1 (Media not supported)". 
    
    
13. Security Considerations 
 
   Receiving systems and users should not place any authentication 
   value on the Handling parameter. 
    
   Note that by design, and under the sending user's request, a content 
   gateway will silently delete unimportant body parts.  Critical 
   content gives the sender the ability to determine the acceptable 
   level integrity of the delivered message.  That is, the message as 
   the content gateway actually passes it on is, in fact, 
   representative of the sender's intentions. 
    
    
14. IANA Considerations 
    
   RFC 3204 already registered the Handling parameter.  It is collected 
   here only for reference and as a placeholder for use both for 
   further expansion in the future and as the normative reference for 
   other documents that need to reference the Handling parameter. 
 
   Per section 9 of [5] here is the IANA registration for Handling. 
    
   To: IANA@IANA.ORG 
   Subject: Registration of new Content-Disposition parameter 
    
   Content-Disposition parameter name: 
   HANDLING 
    
   Allowable values for this parameter: 
   REQUIRED 
   OPTIONAL 
    
   Description: 
   Marks the body part as required for delivery (REQUIRED) or can be 
   silently discarded (OPTIONAL).  See RFC <this document> and RFC 3204. 
   Per RFC 2183, the Content-Disposition parameter name is not case 
   sensitive.  Per RFC <this document>, the values of the parameter are 
   also not case sensitive.

16. Acknowledgments 
    
   Emily Candell of Comverse Network Systems was instrumental in 
   helping work out the base issues in the û00 draft in Adelaide. 
    
   Ned Freed pointed out that this mechanism was about criticality, not 
   notification.  That insight made the concept and descriptions 
   infinitely more straightforward.  If it's still confusing, it's my 
   fault! 
    
   Keith Moore for helped tighten-up the explanations, and he approved 
   of the use of Content-Disposition. 
    
   Dropping the IMPORTANT critical content type took away one of the 
   reasons for partial non-delivery notification.  That makes Jutta 
   Degener very happy! 
    
   Harald Alvestrand and Chris Newman suggested some implementation 
   examples. 
    
   Greg White asked THE key question that let us realize that critical 
   content processing was a gateway function, and not a MTA or UA 
   function. 
    
   Jon Peterson cleared up how handling actually does work in the SIP 
   environment. 
    
   An enormous thank you to Michelle S. Cotton at IANA for helping me 
   craft the original IANA Considerations section in 2000, and for 
   catching the functional overlap with RFC 3204 in January 2002. 
    
   Any errors, omissions, or silliness are my fault.
