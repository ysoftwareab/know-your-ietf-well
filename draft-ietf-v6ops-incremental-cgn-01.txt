Abstract 

   Global IPv6 deployment was slower than originally expected in the 
   last ten years. As IPv4 address exhaustion gets closer, the IPv4/IPv6 
   transition issues become more critical and complicated. Host-based 
   transition mechanisms are not able to meet the requirements while 
   most end users are not sufficiently expert to configure or maintain 
   these transition mechanisms. Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN) with integrated 
   transition mechanisms can simplify the operation of end users during 
   the IPv4/IPv6 migration or coexistence period. This document proposes 
   an incremental CGN approach for IPv6 transition. It can provide IPv6 
   access services for IPv6-enabled end hosts and IPv4 access services 
   for IPv4 end hosts while remaining most of legacy IPv4 ISP networks 
   unchanged. It is suitable for the initial stage of IPv4/IPv6 
   migration. Unlike NAT444 CGN alone, it also supports and encourages 
   transition towards dual-stack or IPv6-only ISP networks. A smooth 
   transition mechanism is also described in this document. It 
   introduces an integrated configurable CGN device and an adaptive Home 
   Gateway (HG) device. Both HG and CGN are re-usable devices during 
   different transition periods. It avoid potential multiple upgrade. 
   ISPs have NOT to make a big transition decision. It enables IPv6 
   migration to be incrementally achieved according to the real user 
   requirements. So ISPs have NOT to make a big transition decision.

1. Introduction 

   Up to now, global IPv6 deployment does not happen as was expected 10 
   years ago. The progress was much slower than originally expected. 
   Network providers were hesitant to take the first move while IPv4 was 
   and is still working well. However, IPv4 address exhaustion is now 
   confirmed to happen soon. The dynamically-updated IPv4 Address Report 
   [IPUSAGE] has analyzed this issue. It predicts early 2011 for IANA 
   unallocated address pool exhaustion and middle 2012 for RIR 
   unallocated address pool exhaustion. Based on this fact, the Internet 
   industry appears to have reached consensus that global IPv6 
   deployment is inevitable and has to be done quite quickly. 

   IPv4/IPv6 transition issues therefore become more critical and 
   complicated for the soon-coming global IPv6 deployment. Host-based 
   transition mechanisms alone are not able to meet the requirements in 
   all cases. Therefore, network supporting functions and/or new 
   transition mechanisms with simple user-side operation are needed. 

   Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN) [I-D.nishitani-cgn], also called NAT444 CGN, 
   alone creates operational problems, but does nothing to help 
   IPv4/IPv6 transition. In fact it allows ISPs to delay the transition, 
   and therefore causes double transition costs (once to add CGN, and 
   again to support IPv6). 

   CGN that integrates multiple transition mechanisms can simplify the 
   operation of end user services during the IPv4/IPv6 migration or 
   coexistence period. CGNs are deployed on the network side and 
   managed/maintained by professionals. On the user side, new Home 
   Gateway (HG) devices may be needed too. They may be provided by 
   network providers, depending on the specific business model. Dual-
   stack lite [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite], also called DS-Lite, 
   is a CGN-based solution that supports transition, but it requires the 
   ISP to upgrade its network to IPv6 immediately. Many ISPs hesitate to 
   do this as the first step. Theoretically, DS-Lite can be used with 
   double encapsulation (IPv4-in-IPv6-in-IPv4) but this seems even less 
   likely to be accepted by an ISP and is not discussed further. 

   This document proposes an incremental CGN approach for IPv6 
   transition. The approach is similar to DS-Lite, but the other way 
   around. Technically, it mainly combines v4-v4 NAT with v6-over-v4 
   tunnelling functions along with some minor adjustment. It can provide 
   IPv6 access services for IPv6-enabled end hosts and IPv4 access 
   services for IPv4 end hosts, while leaving most of legacy IPv4 ISP 
   networks unchanged. The deployment of this technology does not affect 
   legacy IPv4 hosts with global IPv4 addresses at all. It is suitable

   for the initial stage of IPv4/IPv6 migration. It also supports 
   transition towards dual-stack or IPv6-only ISP networks. 

   A smooth transition mechanism is also described in this document. It 
   introduces an integrated configurable CGN device and an adaptive HG 
   device. Both CGN and HG are re-usable devices during different 
   transition periods. It avoid potential multiple upgrade. It enables 
   IPv6 migration to be incrementally achieved according to the real 
   user requirements. So ISPs have NOT to make a big transition 
   decision. 

2. An Incremental CGN Approach 

   Most ISP networks are still IPv4. Network providers are starting to 
   provide IPv6 access services for end users. However, at the initial 
   stage of IPv4/IPv6 migration, IPv4 connectivity and traffic would be 
   the majority for most ISP networks. ISPs would like to minimize the 
   changes on their IPv4 networks. Switching the whole ISP network into 
   IPv6-only would be considered as a radical strategy. Switching the 
   whole ISP network to dual stack is less radical, but introduces 
   operational costs and complications. Although some ISPs have 
   successfully deployed dual stack routers, others prefer not to do 
   this as their first step in IPv6. However, they currently face two 
   urgent pressures - to compensate for an immediate shortage of IPv4 
   addresses by deploying some method of address sharing, and to prepare 
   actively for the deployment of IPv6 address space and services. ISPs 
   facing only one pressure out of two could adopt either CGN (for 
   shortage of IPv6 addresses) or 6rd (to provide IPv6 connectivity 
   services). The approach described in this draft is targeting to 
   addresses both of these pressures at the same time by combining v4-v4 
   CGN with v6-over-v4 tunnelling technologies. 

2.1. Incremental CGN Approach Overview 

   The incremental CGN approach we propose is illustrated as the 
   following figure.

    Figure 1: incremental CGN approach with IPv4 ISP network 

   DS HG = Dual-Stack Home Gateway (CPE). 

   As showed in the above figure, the ISP has not significantly changed 
   its IPv4 network. This approach enables IPv4 hosts to access the IPv4 
   Internet and IPv6 hosts to access the IPv6 Internet. A dual stack 
   host can be treated as an IPv4 host when it uses IPv4 access service 
   and as an IPv6 host when it uses IPv6 access service. In order to 
   enable IPv4 hosts to access IPv6 Internet and IPv6 hosts to access 
   IPv4 Internet, NAT-PT [RFC2766, RFC4966] (or its replacement) can be 
   integrated with CGN. The integration of such mechanisms is out of 
   scope for this document 

   Two new types of devices need to be deployed in this approach: a 
   dual-stack home gateway, which may follow the requirements of 
   [I-D.ietf-v6ops-ipv6-cpe-router], and dual-stack CGN. The dual-stack 
   home gateway integrates IPv4 forwarding and v6-over-v4 tunnelling 
   functions. It may integrate v4-v4 NAT function, too. The dual-stack 
   CGN integrates v6-over-v4 tunnelling and v4-v4 CGN functions. 

2.2. Choice of tunnelling technology 

   In principle, this model will work with any form of tunnel between 
   the DS HG and the dual-stack CGN. However, tunnels that require 
   individual configuration are clearly undesirable because of their 
   operational cost. Configured tunnels based directly on [RFC4213] are 
   therefore not suitable. A tunnel broker according to [RFC3053] would 
   also have high operational costs. 

   Modified 6RD [RFC5569, I-D.ietf-softwire-ipv6-6rd] technology appears 
   suitable to support v6-over-v4 tunnelling with low operational cost. 
   Modified GRE [RFC2784] with additional auto-configuration mechanism 
 
 
Jiang, et al.         Expires December 22, 2010               [Page 5] 

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-v6ops-incremental-cgn-01.txt       June 2010 
    

   is also suitable to support v6-over-v4 tunnelling. Other tunnelling 
   mechanisms such as 6over4 [RFC2529], 6to4 [RFC3056], the Intra-Site 
   Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) [RFC5214] or Virtual 
   Enterprise Traversal (VET) [RFC5558] are also considered. If the ISP 
   has an entirely MPLS infrastructure between the HG and the dual-stack 
   CGN, it would also be possible to consider a 6PE [RFC4798] tunnel 
   directly over MPLS. This would, however, only be suitable for an 
   advanced HG that is unlikely to be found as a home gateway, and is 
   not further discussed here. 

2.3. Behaviour of Dual-stack Home Gateway 

   When a dual-stack home gateway receives a data packet from an end 
   host, it firstly checks whether the packet is IPv4 or IPv6. For IPv4 
   data, the HG can directly forward it to CGN if there is no v4-v4 NAT 
   running on the HG. Or the HG translates packet source address from a 
   HG-scope private IPv4 address into a CGN-scope private IPv4 address, 
   then forwards it to CGN. The HG records the v4-v4 address mapping 
   information for inbound packets, just like normal NAT does. 

   For IPv6 data, the HG needs to encapsulate the data into an IPv4 
   tunnel, which has the dual-stack CGN as the other end. Then the HG 
   sends the new IPv4 packet towards CGN. 

   The HG records the mapping information between the tunnel and the 
   source IPv6 address for inbound packets if HG uplinks to more than 
   one CGN. Detailed considerations for the use of multiple CGNs by one 
   HG are for further study. 

2.4. Behaviour of Dual-stack CGN 

   When a dual-stack CGN receives a data packet from a dual-stack home 
   gateway, it firstly checks whether the packet is a normal IPv4 packet 
   or a v6-over-v4 tunnel packet. For a normal IPv4 packet, the CGN 
   translates packet source address from a CGN-scope private IPv4 
   address into a public IPv4 address, and then send it to IPv4  
   Internet. The CGN records the v4-v4 address mapping information for 
   inbound packets, just like normal NAT does. For a v6-over-v4 tunnel 
   packet, the CGN needs to decapsulate it into the original IPv6 packet 
   and then send it to IPv6 Internet. The CGN records the mapping 
   information between the tunnel and the source IPv6 address for 
   inbound packets. 

   Depending on the deployed location of the CGN, it may use v6-over-v4 
   tunnels to connect to the IPv6 Internet.

2.5. Impact for existing end hosts and remaining networks 

   This approach does not affect the remaining networks at all. Legacy 
   IPv4 ISP networks and their IPv4 devices remain in use. The existing 
   IPv4 hosts, shown as the right box in Figure 1, either having global 
   IPv4 addresses or behind v4-v4 NAT can connect to IPv4 Internet as it 
   is now. Of course, these hosts, if they are upgraded to become dual-
   stack hosts, can access IPv6 Internet through IPv4 ISP network by 
   using IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnel technologies. 

2.6. IPv4/IPv6 intercommunication 

   Although IPv6-only public services are not expected as long as there 
   is an IPv4-only customer base in the world, for obvious commercial 
   reasons. However, IPv4/IPv6 intercommunication may become issues in 
   many scenarios. 

   Each ISP can provide its IPv6-only customers with a network-layer 
   translation service to satisfy this need. Such a service is not fully 
   defined at this time, so we refer to it non-specifically as "NAT64". 
   Current work in the IETF is focussed on one particular proposal  
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful]. The NAT64 service can be 
   provided as a common service located at the border between the ISP 
   and the IPv4 Internet, beyond the dual stack CGN from the customer's 
   viewpoint. It may be integrated into CGN devices too. 

   [I-D.boucadair-dslite-interco-v4v6] describes a proposal to enhance 
   DS-lite solution with an additional feature to ease interconnection 
   between IPv4 and IPv6 realms. Furthermore, home users may encounter 
   the problem of reaching legacy IPv4-only public services from IPv6-
   only clients. This problem could already exist in Phase 1, but will 
   become more serious as time goes on. 

2.7. Discussion 

   For IPv4 traffic, this approach inherits all the problems of CGN 
   (e.g., scaling, and the difficulty of supporting well-known ports for 
   inbound traffic). Application layer problems created by double NAT 
   are for further study. 

   If a different technology than v4-v4 NAT is chosen for IPv4 address 
   sharing, for example [I-D.ymbk-aplusp], the present approach could be 
   suitably modified, for example replacing the v4-v4 NAT function by 
   the A+P gateway function. 

   However, for IPv6 traffic, a user behind the DS HG will see normal 
   IPv6 service. We therefore observe that an IPv6 tunnel MTU of at 
 
 
Jiang, et al.         Expires December 22, 2010               [Page 7] 

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-v6ops-incremental-cgn-01.txt       June 2010 
    

   least 1500 bytes would ensure that the mechanism does not cause 
   excessive fragmentation of IPv6 traffic nor excessive IPv6 path MTU 
   discovery interactions. 

   However, for IPv6 traffic, a user behind the DS HG will see normal 
   IPv6 service. This, and the absence of NAT problems for IPv6, will 
   create an incentive for users and application service providers to 
   prefer IPv6. 

   ICMP filtering [RFC4890] function may be included as part of CGN 
   functions. 

3. Smooth transition towards IPv6 infrastructure 

   This incremental CGN approach can easily be transited from NAT444 CGN 
   or 6rd. NAT444 CGN solves the public address shortage issues in the 
   current IPv4 infrastructure. However, it does not contribute towards 
   IPv6 at all. This incremental CGN approach can inherit NAT444 CGN 
   function while providing overlay IPv6 services. 6rd mechanism can 
   also transform into this incremental CGN with small modifications. 
   One consideration is that home gateways also have to be changed 
   correspondently. 

   This incremental CGN can also easily be transited into IPv6-enabled 
   infrastructure, in which the ISP network is either dual-stack or 
   IPv6-only. For dual-stack ISP networks, dual-stack home gateways can 
   simply switch off the v6-over-v4 function and forward both IPv6 and 
   IPv4 traffic directly while the dual-stack CGN only keeps its v4-v4 
   NAT function. However, this is considered an unlikely choice, since 
   we expect ISPs to choose the approach described here because they 
   want to avoid dual-stack deployment completely. For IPv6-only ISP 
   networks, the DS-Lite solution also needs dual-stack home gateway and 
   CGN devices. 

    

   The best business model for this approach is that an integrated 
   configurable CGN device and an adaptive HG device. The integrated CGN 
   hardware may be integrated multiple functions, include NAT444 CGN, 
   6rd router, incremental CGN, DS-Lite CGN and dual-stack forwarding. 
   It could act as different device with only software configuration 
   change while the hardware and its physical position/connectivity 
   remains no change at all. HG has also integrated these correspondent 
   functions, and be able to automatically detect the change on the CGN 
   side. 


 
 
Jiang, et al.         Expires December 22, 2010               [Page 8] 

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-v6ops-incremental-cgn-01.txt       June 2010 
    

   For example, the appearance of IPv6 Route Advertisement messages or 
   DHCPv6 messages can be used as a signal of DS-Lite CGN. Then when an 
   ISP decides to switch from incremental CGN to DS-Lite CGN, it may be 
   that only a configuration change or a minor software update is needed 
   on the CGNs. The home gateway will then detect this change and switch 
   automatically to DS-Lite mode. The only impact on the home user will 
   be to receive a different IPv6 prefix. 

   In this smooth transition model, both CGN and HG are re-usable 
   devices during different transition periods. It avoid potential 
   multiple upgrade. It enables IPv6 migration to be incrementally 
   achieved according to the real user requirements. ISPs have NOT to 
   make a big transition decision. 

4. Security Considerations 

   Security issues associated with NAT have been documented in [RFC2663] 
   and [RFC2993]. 

   Further security analysis will be needed to understand double NAT 
   security issues and tunnel security issues. However, since the tunnel 
   proposed here exists entirely within a single ISP network, between 
   the HG/CPE and the CGN, the threat model is relatively simple. 
   [RFC4891] describes how to protect tunnels using IPSec, but it is not 
   clear whether this would be an important requirement. An ISP could 
   deem its infrastructure to have sufficient security without 
   additional protection of the tunnels. 

   The dual-stack home gateway will need to provide basic security for 
   IPv6 [I-D.ietf-v6ops-cpe-simple-security]. Other aspects are 
   described in [RFC4864]. 

5. IANA Considerations 

   This draft does not request any IANA action.
