Abstract

   This MIB module defines textual conventions to represent STD 66
   Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs).  The intent is that these
   textual conventions will be imported and used in MIB modules that
   would otherwise define their own representation(s).

Internet-Draft                   URI MIB                      March 2007


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   It defines a textual convention to represent STD 66 [RFC3986] URIs.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

            This URI MUST be a normalized as defined in section 6 of

            are case-insensitive, but objects using this textual
            convention MUST use normalized URIs.  The purpose of this
            restriction is to help provide unique URIs for use as MIB
            table indexes.  Note that normalization of URIs does not
            by itself provide uniqueness: Two textually distinct
            normalized URIs may be equivalent.

            A zero-length URI is not a valid URI.  This can be used to
            express 'URI absent' where required, for example when used
            as an index field."

            STD 66 URIs are of unlimited length.  Objects using this
            textual convention impose an arbitrary length limit on the
            URIs that they can represent.  If no length restriction is

4.  Security Considerations

   See also the Security Considerations of STD 66 [RFC3986].

   This MIB module does not define any management objects.  Instead, it
   defines a textual convention that may be imported by other MIB
   modules and used for object definitions.

   Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB
   modules that define management objects.  This document therefore has
   no impact on the security of the Internet.

5.  IANA Considerations

   URI-TC-MIB should be rooted under the mib-2 subtree.  IANA is
   requested to assign { mib-2 XXX } to the URI-TC-MIB module specified
   in this document.

   This module was generated by editing together contributions from
   Randy Presuhn, Dan Romascanu, Bill Fenner, Juergen Schoenwaelder, and
