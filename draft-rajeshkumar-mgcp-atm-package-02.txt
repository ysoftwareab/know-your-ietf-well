1.0. Abstract 
 
     This document describes an ATM MGCP package which includes new Local 
     Connection Options, ATM-specific events and signals, and ATM statistics 
     parameters. Also included is a description of codec and profile 
     negotiation. 
      
2.0. Conventions used in this document 
      
     The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
     "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
     document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119. 
      
     MGCP identifiers are case-insensitive. This includes package names, event 
     names, local connection options and other elements of 
     the MGCP header. 
      
3.0. ATM Package 
 
     The ATM package in this document consists of Local Connection Options 
     (Section 3.1), Events and Signals (Section 3.2) and ATM Statistics 
     Parameters (Section 3.3). Section 4.1 has guidelines  
     for consistency in the use of Local Connection Options. Section  
     4.2 describes codec and profile negotiation.   
      
     In the  ATM networks addressed in this document,  services are carried 
     directly over ATM without an intervening IP layer. The Local Connection 
     Options, Events, Signals and Statistics Parameters described in this 
     section are not needed for VoIP calls which can be carried, in whole or in 
     part, over an ATM network. In that case, the constructs  defined elsewhere 
     for IP are sufficient. 
      
     The atm local connection option names, event names and signal names  
     should always have an "atm" package prefix. Backward 
     compatibility with older implementations that use ôX-atmö 
     as the package name is desirable. 
      
3.1. ATM Local Connection Options 
      
     The Local Connection Options (LCOs) defined in this section are specific 
     to ATM applications. Like other Local Connection Options (LCOs), these can 
     be used in create connection, modify connection and audit connection 
     transactions, and in the capabilities structure in audit endpoint 
     transactions.  
      
     ATM Local Connection Options are divided into the following categories: 
     ATM bearer connection, ATM adaptation layer, service layer, ATM bearer 
     traffic management and AAL dimensioning.  
      
     When parameter values are represented in decimal format, leading zeros are 
     omitted.

     3.1.1 ATM bearer connection 
      
     These local connection options are used to parameterize ATM bearer 
     connections.

     Connection type (ct): This parameter describes the ATM adaptation layer. 
     The values that can be assigned to it are: AAL1, AAL1_SDT, AAL1_UDT, AAL2, 
     AAL3/4, AAL5 and USER_DEFINED_AAL. The user defined adaptation layer is 
     per amendment 2 of ITU-T Q.2931. 
      
     Type of Bearer/VC (vc): This indicates whether a PVC, CID or an SVC is to 
     be used for an ATM connection. Possible values are: PVC, SVC or CID. 
     Omitting this parameter will result in the use of a default, which could 
     be embedded or provisioned. The value "PVC" covers both classical PVCs and 
     SPVCs. The value ôCIDö covers 
     subchannels within AAL1 [35] and AAL2 [10] virtual circuits. 
     While the parameter atm/vc describes bearer type, the parameter 
     atm/se (described below) requests the set-up of a bearer path. 
     A value of ôSVCö for atm/vc does not imply that the media  
     gateway should initiate signaling for bearer set-up, since  
     this might be done by another node such as the far-end media 
     gateway.    
      
 
     Enable path set-up (se): This local connection option is used to 
     explicitly enable or disable the use of bearer signaling for path set-up. 
     Permitted   values of this local connection option are  "on" and "off". 
     When this option is omitted, other means are used to determine if bearer 
     signaling is to be used for path set-up. Examples of bearer signaling are 
     SVC signaling, ITU Q.2630.1 signaling and combinations thereof. Examples 
     of such combinations are the set-up of an AAL2 SVC and the assignment of a 
     CID within it or the set-up of a concatenation of an AAL2 single-CID SVC 
     and a CID channel within a multiplexed AAL2 VC. This parameter allows the 
     flexible support of both the backwards and forward bearer connection set-
     up methods. In the former case, the call-terminating gateway sets up the

     bearer connection. In the latter case, the call-originating gateway sets 
     up the bearer connection.   
 
     Connection Element Identifier (ci): This indicates the Virtual Circuit or 
     CID to be used for the bearer connection. It is used when the call agent 
     manages VC and/or CID resources in the bearer network.   
 
     The ci parameter can be in one of the following formats: 
 
     * VCCI-<vcci> 
     * VCCI-<vcci>/CID-<cid> 
     * <ATMaddressType>-<ATMaddress>/VCCI-<vcci> 
     * <ATMaddress>/VCCI-<vcci> 
     * <ATMaddressType>-<ATMaddress>/VCCI-<vcci>/CID-<cid> 
     * <ATMaddress>/VCCI-<vcci>/CID-<cid> 
     * BCG-<bcg>/VCCI-<vcci>

     * BCG-<bcg>/VPI-<vpi>/VCI-<vci> 
     * BCG-<bcg>/VPI-<vpi>/VCI-<vci>/CID-<cid> 
     * PORT-<portId>/VPI-<vpi>/VCI-<vci> 
     * PORT-<portId>/VPI-<vpi>/VCI-<vci>/CID-<cid> 
     * VPCI-<vpci>/VCI-<vci>

     The CID, or Channel ID, can refer to AAL1 as well as AAL2  
     applications. In AAL1 applications based on [35], it refers to 
     the octet position, starting from one,  within an n x 64 SDT  
     frame. 
 
     The VPCI is a 16 bit field defined in Section 4.5.16 of ITU Q.2931. The 
     VPCI  is similar to the VPI, except for its width and the fact that it 
     retains  its value across VP crossconnects. 
       
     The VCCI is a 16 bit field defined in ITU Recommendation Q.2941.2 [14].    
     The VCCI is similar to the VCI, except for the fact that it retains  its 
     value across VC crossconnects.  
         
     In general, <vpci> and  <vcci> values are  unique between  a  pair of 
     nodes. When they are unique between a pair of nodes but not unique within 
     a network, they need to be qualified, at any node, by the ATM address of 
     the remote  node. These parameters can be pre-provisioned or signaled via 
 
R.Kumar                      Informational                          5 
                            ATM MGCP Package             September 2001 
 
 
     SVC signaling messages. When VPCI and VCCI values are pre-provisioned, 
     administrations have the option of provisioning them uniquely in a 
     network. In this case, the ATM address of the far end is not needed to 
     qualify these parameters.  
 
     The <portId> parameter is used to identify the physical trunk port on an 
     ATM module. It can be represented as a decimal or hex number of up to 32 
     digits.  
      
     In some applications, it is meaningful to bundle  a set of connections     
     between a pair of ATM nodes into a bearer connection  
     group. The <bcg> subparameter is an eight bit field that allows  
     the bundling of up to 255 VPCs or VCCs.  
      
     In some applications, it is necessary to wildcard some elements of the ci 
     local connection option. The "$" wildcard character can be substituted for 
     some of the terms of this parameter. While wildcarding, the constant 
     strings that qualify the terms in the ci parameter are retained. The 
     concatenation <ATMaddressType>-<ATMaddress> can be wildcarded in the 
     following ways: 
       
        * The entire concatenation, <ATMaddressType>-<ATMaddress>, is  
          replaced with a "$". 
        * <ATMaddress> is replaced with a "$", but <ATMaddressType> is 
          not. 
 
     Examples of wildcarding the ci parameter in the AAL1 and AAL5contexts are: 
     VCCI-$, BCG-100/VPI-20/VCI-$.  
      
     Examples of wildcarding the ci parameter in the AAL2 context are: VCCI-
     40/CID-$, BCG-100/VPI-20/VCI-120/CID-$. 
      
     If the addressType is NSAP, the address is expressed in the standard 
     dotted hex form. This is a string of 40 hex digits, with dots after the 
     2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, 18th, 22nd, 26th, 30th, 34th and 38th digits. The 
     "0x" prefix is not used, since this is always represented in hex. The last 
     octet of the NSAP address is the 'selector' field that is available for 
     non-standard use. For example: 
      
       L: atm/ci:NSAP-47.0091.8100.0000.0060.3e64.fd01.0060.3e64.fd01.00/ 
                 VCCI-65 
  
     If the ATMaddressType is E164, the ATMaddress is expressed as a decimal 
     number  with up to 15 digits. For example: 
  
        L: atm/ci:E164-9738294382/VCCI-100 
          
     The E.164 numbers used can be in the International Format E.164 or conform 
     to a private numbering plan.  
  
     If the ATMaddressType is GWID, it means that the address is a

     Gateway Identifier or Node Alias. This may or may not be globally unique. 
     In this format, the  ATMaddress is expressed as an alphanumeric string 
     ("A"-"Z", "a"-"z", "0" - "9",".","-","_"). For example: 
 
         L: atm/ci:GWID-officeABCmgx101vism12 
      
     The keyword "ALIAS" can be substituted for "GWID". For example: 
  
         L: atm/ci:ALIAS-officeABCmgx101vism12 
               
     An example of a GWID (ALIAS)is the CLLI code used for telecom    
     equipment. For all practical purposes, it should be adequate for the    
     GWID (ALIAS) to be a variable length string with a maximum size of 32    
     characters.  
 
3.1.2 ATM adaptation layer (AAL) 
 
     These local connection options are used to parameterize the ATM adaptation 
     layer (AAL). These are further classified as: generic AAL connection 
     options, AAL1-related connection options and AAL2-related connection 
     options. Currently, there are no local connection options defined in this 
     category that pertain to AAL5.

     take on integral values in the inclusive range [1...24]. For E1-based 
     applications, it can take on integral values in the inclusive range 
     [1...31]. When this parameter is omitted, the subchannel count must be 
     known by other means.

     Partial Fill Count (pf): When present, the 'pf' parameter is used to 
     indicate the fill level of cells. When this local connection option is 
     absent, then other means (such as provisionable defaults) are used to 
     determine the presence and level of partial fill.  
      
     This parameter indicates the number of non-pad payload octets, not 
     including any AAL SAR or convergence sublayer octets. For example, in some 
     AAL1 applications that use partially filled cells with padding at the end, 
     this attribute indicates the number of leading payload octets not 
     including any AAL overhead.  
      
     In general, permitted values of the pf parameter are integers in  the 
     range 1 - 48 inclusive. However, this upper bound is  different for 
     different adaptations since the AAL overhead, if any, is different. If the 
     specified partial fill is greater than or equal to the maximum fill,  then 
     complete fill is used. Using a 'partial' fill of 48 always disables 
     partial fill. 
      
     In the AAL1 context, this parameter applies uniformly to both P and non-P 
     cells. In AAL1 applications that do not distinguish between P and non-P 
     cells, a value of 47 indicates complete fill (i.e. the absence of partial 
     fill). In AAL1 applications that distinguish between P and non-P cells, a 
     value of 46 indicates no padding in P-cells and a padding of one in non-P 
     cells.  
      
     If partial fill is enabled (i.e there is padding in at least some cells), 
     then AAL1 structures must not be split across cell boundaries. These shall 
     fit in any cell. Hence, their size shall be less than or equal to the 
     partial fill size. Further, the partial fill size is preferably  an 
     integer multiple of the structure size. If not, then the partial fill size 
     stated in the local connection options shall be truncated to an integer 
     multiple of the structure size (e.g. a partial fill size of 40 is 
     truncated to 36 to support six 6 x 64 channels). 
      
     Clock recovery type (crt): This is used in AAL1 UDT (unstructured data 
     transfer) applications only. It can be assigned the values: "NULL", 
     "SRTS", or "ADAPTIVE". A value of "NULL" is equivalent to omitting this  
     parameter and implies that the stream (T1 or E1)  encapsulated in ATM is

     either synchronous to the ATM network or is re-timed, before AAL1 
     encapsulation,  via slip buffers. The default value used in the absence of 
     this LCO can be hardcoded or provisioned. 
      
     Forward Error Correction Enable (fe): This indicates whether FEC, as 
     defined in ITU I.363.1 [1], is enabled or not. Possible values are: 
     "NULL", "DELAY_SENSITIVE" and "LOSS_SENSITIVE". FEC can be enabled 
     differently for delay-sensitive and loss-sensitive connections. A "NULL" 
     value implies disabling FEC for an AAL1 connection.

     Profile List (pfl): This is a list of profiles. Profile types are followed 
     by profile numbers for each type. The ordering of profiles can imply 
     preference, with the most preferred profile first. There can be multiple 
     instances of the same profile type in this list. 
          
     The format of the pfl parameter is as follows:

     <profileType#1><format list#1><profileType#2><format list#2> ... 
     <profileType #M><format list#M> 
         
     where <format list#i> has the form <profile#i_1>...<profile#i_N> 
      
     The <profileType> parameter indicates the type of profile. It is expressed 
     in the format AAL2/<profileClass> where <profileClass> identifies the  
     source of the definition of the profile. 
      
     The <profileClass> can be assigned  a string value indicating the source 
     of the subsequent profile numbers until the next <profileType> field.  The 
     following rules apply to the contents of the <profileClass> field: 
   
    - <profileClass> = "ITU" indicates profiles defined by ITU. 
      Examples: profiles defined in the I.366.2 specification [2]. 
    - <profileClass> = "ATMF"  indicates profiles defined by ATM 
      forum. Examples: profiles defined in af-vtoa-0113 [3]  
      or af-vmoa-0145.000 [21].  
    - <profileClass> = "custom"  indicates profiles defined by a 
      corporation or a multi-vendor agreement. Since there is no  
      standard administration of this convention, care should be taken  
      to preclude inconsistencies within the scope of a deployment. 
    - <profileClass> = <corporateName> 
      An equipment vendor or service provider can use its registered, 
      globally unique corporate name (e.g. Cisco, Telcordia etc.) as a  
      string value of the <profileClass>. It is suggested that  
      organizations maintain consistent definitions of the advertised  
      AAL2 profiles that bear their corporate name. 
    - The <profileClass> can be based on IEEE Standard 802-1990,  
      Section 5.1, which defines the globally unique, IEEE- 
      administered, three-octet OUIs used in MAC addresses and protocol   
      identifiers.  In this case, the <profileClass> field shall be  
      assigned a string value of "IEEE:" concatenated with <oui> where  
      <oui> is the hex representation of a three-octet field identical  
      to the IEEE OUI. Since this is always represented in hex,  the  
      "0x" prefix is not used. Leading zeros may be omitted. For 
      example, "IEEE:00000C" and "IEEE:C" both refer to Cisco Systems,  
      Inc.  
 
     The <profile#> parameter is expressed as a decimal number in the range 1-
     255.  
      
     An example of the use of the pfl parameter is:  
      
     L: atm/pfl:AAL2/ITU 8  AAL2/ATMF 7 8 AAL2/custom 100  AAL2/cisco 200  
      
     The syntax for pfl can be represented compactly in the following ABNF 
     (rfc2234) form: 
 
       pfl  = 1*(profileType (1*profile#))  
       profileType = "AAL2/" profileClass space 
       profile# = 1-255 space ; decimal integer followed by space

       space = %d32 
      
     Simplified CPS (smplCPS): This enables the AAL2 CPS simplification 
     described in [21]. It can be assigned the following values: on, off. Under 
     this simplification, each ATM cell contains exactly on AAL2 packet. If    
     necessary, octets at the end of the cell are padded with zeros. 
 
     AAL2 combined use timer (tmcu): This is defined in ITU I.363.2 [10]. It is 
     an integer number of microseconds, represented as the decimal  equivalent 
     of 32 bits. 
 
     AAL service access point (aalsap): The service access point for AAL2 is 
     defined in ITU I.366.2 [2]. The aalsap local connection option can take on 
     the following string values: AUDIO, MULTIRATE. 
      
     Circuit mode (cktmd): This is used to enable circuit mode data [2].  It 
     can be assigned a value of "on" or "off". 
      
     Frame mode (frmd): This is used to enable frame mode data [2].  It can be 
     assigned a value of "on" or "off". 
 
     Generic PCM setting (genpcm): This indicates whether generic PCM encoding 
     in AAL2 profiles is A-law or Mu-law.  It can be assigned the string values 
     of "PCMA" and "PCMU". 
      
     Transmission error detection (ted): Transmission error detection is 
     defined in  ITU I.366.1 [11].  The ted local connection option can take on 
     the following values: on, off. This local connection option is useful in 
     qualifying the aalApp local connection option, when the value of the 
     latter is "itu_i3661_unassured". 
      
     SSSAR reassembly timer (rastimer): This is defined in ITU I.366.1 [11]. It 
     is an integer number of microseconds, represented as the decimal 
     equivalent of 32 bits.

     Voice codec selection (vsel): This is a prioritized list of one or more 3-
     tuples describing voice service. Each vsel 3-tuple indicates a codec, an 
     optional packet length and an optional packetization period. The vsel 
     local connection option is structured as follows: 
 
             <encodingName #1> <packetLength #1><packetTime #1> 
             <encodingName #2> <packetLength #2><packetTime #2> 
                ... 
             <encodingName #N> <packetLength #N><packetTime #N> 
 
     where the <encodingName> refers to a codec name such as PCMU, G726-32, 
     G729  etc. See [18] and [34] for a list of codecs with static payload 
     types. The <packetLength> is a decimal integer representation of the 
     packet length in octets. The <packetTime> is a decimal integer 
     representation of the packetization interval in microseconds. 
 
     Voiceband data codec selection (dsel): This is a prioritized list of one 
     or more 3-tuples describing voiceband data service. Each dsel 3-tuple 
     indicates a codec, an optional packet length and an optional packetization 
     period. Depending on the application, the dsel local connection option may 
     or may not cover facsimile service. This is indicated via an <fxIncl> flag 
     preceding the list of 3-tuples. This flag indicates whether the definition 
     of voiceband data includes facsimile ("on" value) or not ("off" value). 
     This flag can also be set to "-", which is equivalent to setting it to 
     "off". If <fxIncl> is "on", then the dsel connection option must be 
     consistent the fsel connection option. The dsel local connection option is 
     structured as follows: 
 
       <fxIncl> <encodingName #1> <packetLength #1><packetTime #1> 
                <encodingName #2> <packetLength #2><packetTime #2>

where the <encodingName> refers to a codec name such as PCMU, G726-32, G729  
etc. The <packetLength> is a decimal integer representation of the packet 
length in octets. The <packetTime> is a decimal integer representation of the 
packetization interval in microseconds. 
       
     Facsimile codec selection (fsel): This is a prioritized list of one or 
     more 3-tuples describing fax service. Each fsel 3-tuple indicates a codec, 
     an optional packet length and an optional packetization period. If the 
     dsel option includes facsimile, the fsel connection option  should be 
     consistent with it.   Each fsel 3-tuple indicates a codec, an optional 
     packet length and an optional packetization period. The fsel local 
     connection option is structured as follows: 
 
                <encodingName #1> <packetLength #1><packetTime #1> 
                <encodingName #2> <packetLength #2><packetTime #2> 
                ... 
                <encodingName #N> <packetLength #N><packetTime #N> 
 
     where the <encodingName> refers to a codec name such as PCMU, G726-32, 
     G729  etc. The <packetLength> is a decimal integer representation of the 
     packet length in octets. The <packetTime> is a decimal integer 
     representation of the packetization interval in microseconds. 
 
     The vsel, fsel and dsel parameters complement the rest of the  local 
     connection options and should be consistent with them.    
      
     Examples of the use of these parameters are: 
 
        L: atm/vsel:G729 10 10000 G726-32 40 10000 
        L: atm/dsel:off PCMA 10 10000 G726-32 40 10000 
        L: atm/fsel:PCMU 40 5000 G726-32 20 5000 
        L: atm/vsel:G729 10 10000 G726-32 40 10000 
        L: atm/dsel:on  PCMA 10 10000 G726-32 40 10000 
 
     The <packetLength>and <packetTime> can be set to "-" when not needed. A 
     <fxIncl> value of "-" is equivalent to setting it to "off". For example: 
 
        L: atm/vsel:G729 - - G726-32 - - 
        L: atm/dsel:- G729 - - G726-32 - - 
        L: atm/fsel:FXDMOD-3 - - 
 
     The vsel, dsel and fsel local connection options can be used in the AAL1, 
     AAL2 and AAL5 contexts. The <packetLength> and <packetTime> are not 
     meaningful in the AAL1 case and should be set to "-". In the AAL2 case, 
     these local connection options determine the use of some or all of the 
     rows in a given profile table. If multiple 3-tuples are present, they can 
     indicate a preferentially ordered assignment of some rows in that profile 
     to voice, voiceband data or facsimile service e.g. row A preferred to row 
     B etc. If multiple profiles are specified in the pfl parameter (described

     in section 3.1.2), the profile qualified by these local connection options 
     is the first profile in the list. 
 
     Codec configuration (ccnf): This is used to convey the contents of the 
     single codec information element (IE) defined in [30]. The contents of 
     this IE are: a single-octet Organizational Identifier (OID) field, 
     followed by a single-octet Codec Type field, followed by zero or more 
     octets of a codec configuration bit-map. The semantics of the codec 
     configuration bit-map are specific to the organization[30, 31]. Since this 
     bit-map is always represented in hex format, the "0x" prefix is omitted. 
     Leading zeros are not omitted. For example: 
      
        L: atm/ccnf:01080C 
      
     indicates an Organizational Identifier of 0x01(the ITU-T). Using [57], the 
     second octet (0x08) indicates a codec type of G.726 (ADPCM). The last 
     octet, 0x0C indicates that 16 kbps and 24 kbps rates are NOT supported, 
     while the 32 kbps and 40 kbps rates ARE supported. 
 
     ISUP User Information (usi): This is used to convey the contents of the 
     'User Information Layer 1 protocol' field within the bearer capability 
     information element defined in Section 4.5.5 of [32], and   reiterated as 
     the user service information element (IE) in Section 3.57    of [33]. The 
     'User Information Layer 1 protocol' field consists of  the five least 
     significant bits of Octet 5 of this information element.  
      
     The usi LCO represented as a string of two hex digits. The "0x"prefix is 
     omitted since this value is always hexadecimal. These hex digits are 
     constructed from an octet with three leading '0' bits and last five bits 
     equal to the 'User Information Layer 1 protocol' field described above. 
     Digits to the left are more significant than  digits to the right. The 
     resulting values of the usi local connection option are as follows:

     ATM transfer capability (atc): This parameter indicates the ATM Transfer 
     Capability described in ITU I.371 [19], equivalent to the ATM Service 
     Category described in the UNI 4.1 Traffic Management specification [8]. In 
     applications conforming to ITU I.371, this parameter can be assigned the 
     following values: DBR, SBR, ABT/IT, ABT/DT, ABR. In applications 
     conforming to the UNI 4.1 Traffic Management specification, this parameter 
     can be assigned the following values: CBR, nrt-VBR, rt-VBR, UBR, ABR, GFR. 
 
     Subtype (sbt): This qualifies the atc local connection option. It can be 
     assigned integer values of 1...5.  The following combinations of the atc 
     and sbt local connection options are meaningful:

     ATM QoS parameters, forward direction (aqf) and backward direction (aqb): 
     Here, forward is the direction away from the media gateway, backward is 
     the direction towards the gateway. If the directional convention used by 
     bearer signaling at the gateway is different, then appropriate 
     translations must be done by the media gateway. These parameters have the 
     following format:

             <cdvType><acdv><ccdv><eetd><cmtd><aclr> 
 
     The <cdvType> parameter can take on the string values of "PP" and "2P". 
     These refer to the peak-to-peak and two-point CDV as defined in UNI 4.0 
     [6] and ITU Q.2965.2 [7] respectively. 
 
     The CDV parameters, <acdv> and <ccdv>, refer to  the acceptable and 
     cumulative  CDVs respectively. These are expressed in units of 
     microseconds and represented as the decimal or hex equivalent of 24-bit 
     fields.  These use the cell loss ratio, <aclr>, as the "alpha" quantiles 
     defined in the ATMF TM 4.1 specification [8] and in ITU I.356 [9].   
                                                                           
     The transit delay  parameters, <eetd> and <cmtd>,  refer to the    end-to-
     end and cumulative  transit delays respectively in    milliseconds. These 
     are represented as the decimal equivalents    of  16-bit fields. These 
     parameters are defined in Q.2965.2 [7], UNI 4.0 [8] and Q.2931 [29]. 
      
     The <aclr> parameter refers to forward and backward acceptable cell loss 
     ratios. This is the ratio between the number of cells lost and the number 
     of cells transmitted. It is expressed as the decimal or hex equivalent of 
     an 8-bit field. This field  expresses an order of magnitude n, where n is 
     an integer in the range  1-15. The Cell Loss Ratio takes on the value 10 
     raised to the power of minus n.   
      
     If any of these parameters is not specified, is inapplicable or is 
     implied, then it is set to   "-". 
 
      
     Examples of the use of the aqf and aqb local connection options are: 
 
        L: atm/aqf:PP 8125 3455 32000 -  11 
        L: atm/aqb:PP 4675 2155 18000 -  12 
 
     This implies a forward acceptable peak-to-peak CDV of 8.125 ms, a     
     backward acceptable peak-to-peak CDV of 4.675 ms, forward     cumulative 
     peak-to-peak CDV of 3.455 ms, a backward cumulative     peak-to-peak CDV 
     of 2.155 ms, a forward end-to-end    transit delay of 32  ms, a backward 
     end-to-end transit delay of 18  ms, an unspecified forward cumulative 
     transit delay, an unspecified backward cumulative transit delay, a forward 
     cell loss ratio of 10 raised to  minus 11 and a backward cell loss ratio 
     of 10 to the minus 12. 
 
     ATM traffic descriptors, forward direction CLP=0+1 (adf0+1), backward 
     direction CLP=0+1 (adb0+1), forward direction CLP=0 (adf0), backward 
     direction CLP=0 (adb0): Here, forward is the direction away from the media 
     gateway, backward is the direction towards the gateway. If the directional 
     convention used by bearer signaling at the gateway is different, then 
     appropriate translations must be done  by the media gateway. The adf0+1, 
     adb0+1, adf0 and adb0 local connection options have the following format: 
 
             <pcr><scr><mbs><cdvt><mcr><mfs><fd><te>

     These parameters are defined per the ATMF TM 4.1 specification [8]. Each 
     of these parameters can be set to "-" if the intent is to not specify it 
     via MGCP. These definitions are listed briefly in Table 7 below.

     The pcr, scr, cdvt and mbs can be represented as the decimal equivalents 
     of 24-bit fields. The mbs and mfs can be represented as the decimal 
     equivalents of 16-bit fields. 
       
      Examples of these local connection options are:

           atm/adb0:200   80   15   - - - -  off 
  
     This implies a forward and backward PCR of 200 cells per second  
     all cells regardless of CLP,  forward and backward PCR of 200 cells  
     per second for cells with CLP=0, a forward and backward SCR of 100  
     cells per second for all cells regardless of CLP, a forward and  
     backward SCR of 80 cells per second for cells with CLP=0,  
     a forward and backward MBS of 20 cells  for all cells regardless  
     of CLP, a forward and backward MBS of 15 cells for cells with  
     CLP=0,  an unspecified CDVT which can be known by other means, 
     and an  MCR and MFS which are unspecified because they are  
     inapplicable. Frame discard is enabled in both the forward and 
     backward directions. Tagging is not enabled in either direction. 
 
     ABR parameters, forward direction  (abrf) and backward direction   (abrb): 
     Here, forward is the direction away from the media gateway, backward is 
     the direction towards the gateway. If the convention used by bearer 
     signaling at the gateway is different, then appropriate translations must 
     be done  by the media gateway. The abrf and abrb local connection options

3.1.5  AAL Dimensioning 
 
     The Local Connection Options in Table 10 are used to dimension the 
     operation of the AAL. In these parameters, forward is the direction away 
     from the media gateway. Backward is the direction towards the media 
     gateway. These parameters are represented as decimal integers in the 
     ranges listed in Table 10.

     Structured Data Transfer Block Size (str): This parameter is meaningful 
     only when structured AAL1 is used. It indicates the size (in octets) of 
     the block used for structured data transfer. If not included as a local 
     connection option, the structure size  is to be known by other means. For 
     instance, af-vtoa-78 [20]  fixes the structure size for  n x 64 service, 
     with or without CAS. The L: atm/str  parameter is coded as the decimal 
     equivalent of a 16-bit field [29]. The theoretical maximum value  of this 
     parameter is 65,535, although most services use much less.  
      
     CBR Rate (cbrRate): This is a hexadecimal representation of the bit map 
     defined in Table 4-6 of ITU Q.2931 [29]. This is represented as exactly 
     two hex digits. For example: 
          
         L: atm/cbrRate:04 
      
     implies a CBR rate of 1.544 Mbps.  
      
     Forward maximum CPCS-SDU size (fcpcs): This is the maximum size of the 
     AAL2 or AA5 CPCS SDU in the forward direction. 
      
     Backward maximum CPCS-SDU size (bcpcs): This is the maximum size of the 
     AAL2 or AA5 CPCS SDU in the backward direction. 
      
     Forward maximum AAL2 CPCS-SDU rate (fSDUrate): This is the maximum rate of 
     the AAL2 CPCS-SDUs in the forward direction. 
      
     Backward maximum AAL2 CPCS-SDU rate (bSDUrate): This is the maximum rate 
     of the AAL2 CPCS-SDUs in the backward direction. 
      
     The fSDUrate and bSDUrate local connection options can be used to rate-
     limit AAL2 CIDs, specially when used in the SSSAR [1] and frame mode [2] 
     contexts. 
      
     Forward maximum frame mode block size (ffrm):  This is the maximum size, 
     in the forward direction, of the AAL2 frame mode data unit (I.366.2) [2].    
      
     Backward maximum frame mode block size (bfrm):  This is the maximum size, 
     in the backward direction, of the AAL2 frame mode data unit (I.366.2) [2].

     Forward maximum SSSAR-SDU size (fsssar):  This is the maximum size, in the 
     forward direction, of the AAL2-based SSSAR-SDU (I.366.1) [1].    
      
     Backward maximum SSSAR-SDU size (bsssar):  This is the maximum size, in 
     the backward direction, of the AAL2-based SSSAR-SDU (I.366.1) [1]. 
      
     Forward maximum SSCOP-SDU size (fsscopsdu):  This is the maximum size, in 
     the forward direction, of the AAL2-based SSCOP-SDU (I.366.1) [1].    
      
     Backward maximum SSCOP-SDU size (bsscopsdu):  This is the maximum size, in 
     the backward direction, of the AAL2-based SSCOP-SDU (I.366.1) [1]. 
      
     Forward maximum SSCOP-UU size (fsscopuu):  This is the maximum size, in 
     the forward direction, of the AAL2-based SSCOP-UU field(I.366.1) [1].    
      
     Backward maximum SSCOP-UU size (bsscopuu):  This is the maximum size, in 
     the backward direction, of the AAL2-based SSCOP- UU field (I.366.1) [1]. 
      
3.2. Signals and Events 
 
     All the events in this package are connection events.  The suffix 
     @<connection-id> can be omitted if there is only one connection to an 
     endpoint. This suffix can also be wildcarded per MGCP rules.  
 
     Set-up complete ( "sc"): 
      
     Within the RequestedEvents (R: ) structure,  "sc " is used to request 
     notification of successful ATM OR AAL2 connection set-up. The ATM OR AAL2  
     bearer path is ready for subscriber payload carriage when this 
     notification is sent. 
      
     This could be the set-up of an SVC, the assignment of an AAL2 CID path and 
     combinations thereof. Examples of such combinations are the set-up of an 
     AAL2 SVC and the assignment of a CID within it or the set-up of a 
     concatenation of an AAL2 single-CID SVC and a CID channel within a 
     multiplexed AAL2 VC. 
      
     An R: atm/sc event notification request does not automatically cause the 
     gateway to initiate the set-up of an ATM OR AAL2 path. The trigger for an 
     ATM OR AAL2 connection set-up is an  "on" value of the L: atm/se local 
     connection option provided with a create or modify connection command.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
      
      
     Set-up failed ("sf"): 
      
     Within the RequestedEvents (R: ) structure, "sf " is used to request 
     notification of a failed ATM OR AAL2 connection set-up.  The   ATM OR AAL2 
     connection set-ups addressed by "sf" are the same as for the "sc" event. 
      
     In some ATM OR AAL2 applications with SVC set-up or bearer-signalled AAL2 
     path assignment, the  "sf " event might not be used. In these cases, the 
     following options are available: 
      
      * the call agent receives a spontaneous delete from the media gateway 
        with appropriate reason code (902).  
      
      * the call agent  receives the  "of" event described below with optional 
        reason code (902). 
 
     Enable CAS via type 3 packets ( "ec"): 
      
     This signal indicates that the media gateway is to forward CAS signaling 
     via type 3 packets on an AAL2 connection. This does not preclude the call 
     agent from requesting notification of CAS state changes. On receiving this 
     signal request, the gateway sustains a bidirectional type 3 CAS protocol 
     over the AAL2 path. This comes to an end when the request is cancelled 
     through a subsequent NotificationRequest command or when the VoAAL2 
     connection is deleted. 
      
     Enable DTMF tones via type 3 packets ( "etd"): 
      
     A gateway will ignore this signal request if it normally forwards and 
     receives DTMF tones via type 3 packets. This signal indicates that the 
     media gateway is to forward  and receive DTMF tones via type 3 packets on 
     an AAL2 connection. This does not preclude the call agent from requesting 
     notification of DTMF tones.  
 
     Enable MF tones via type 3 packets ( "etm"): 
      
     A gateway will ignore this signal request if it normally forwards and 
     receives MF tones via type 3 packets. This signal indicates that the media 
     gateway is to forward  and receive MF tones via type 3 packets on an AAL2 
     connection. This does not preclude the call agent from requesting 
     notification of MF tones. This signal request does not specify the MF tone 
     type, which is known by other means.

     Enable R1 MF tones via type 3 packets ( "etr1"): 
      
     A gateway will ignore this signal request if it normally forwards and 
     receives R1 MF tones via type 3 packets. This signal indicates that the 
     media gateway is to forward  and receive R1 MF tones via type 3 packets on 
     an AAL2 connection. This does not preclude the call agent from requesting 
     notification of R1 MF tones.  
       
      
     Enable MF tones via type 3 packets ( "etr2"): 
      
     A gateway will ignore this signal request if it normally forwards and 
     receives R2 MF tones via type 3 packets. This signal indicates that the 
     media gateway is to forward  and receive R2 MF tones via type 3 packets on 
     an AAL2 connection. This does not preclude the call agent from requesting 
     notification of R2 MF tones.  
 
     Used codec changed ( "uc (string) "): 
      
     If armed via an R:atm/uc, a media gateway signals a codec change through 
     an O:atm/uc.  The alphanumeric string in parentheses is optional. It is 
     the encoding name of the codec to which the switch is made.  Although this 
     event can be used with all ATM adaptations (AAL1, AAL2 and AAL5): 
      
     * The pftrans event is more suited to AAL2 applications.  
     * Codec switches do not generally occur mid-call in AAL1  
       applications. 
      
     Packet time changed ( "ptime(#)"): 
      
     If armed via an R:atm/ptime, a media gateway signals a packetization 
     period change through an O:atm/ptime.  The decimal number in parentheses 
     is optional. It is the new packetization period in milliseconds. In AAL2 
     applications, the pftrans event can be used to cover packetization period 
     changes (and codec changes). 
      
     Profile element changed ( "pftrans(#)"): 
      
     If armed via an R:atm/pftrans, a media gateway signals a mid-call profile 
     element change through an O:atm/ptime. This event is used with AAL2 
     adaptation only.  A profile element is a row in a profile table.  Profile 
     elements indicating silence should not trigger this event. The decimal 
     number in parentheses is optional. It is the row number to which the 
     switch is made. Rows are counted downward, beginning from 1. 
 
     Cell loss exceeded ( "cle(#) "): 
      
     This event indicates that the cell loss rate exceeds the threshold #. If 
     the threshold is omitted in the requested events and observed events 
     parameters, it is known by other means. The optional decimal number is the 
     number of dropped cells per 100,000 cells.  For example, cle(10) indicates 
     cells are being dropped at a rate of 1 in 10,000 cells.

                            ATM MGCP Package             September 2001 
 
 
 
     Packet loss exceeded ( "ple(#)"): 
      
     This event indicates that the packet loss rate exceeds the threshold #. If 
     the threshold is omitted in the requested events and observed events 
     parameters, it is known by other means. The optional decimal number is the 
     number of dropped packets per 100,000 packets.  For example, ple(10) 
     indicates packets are being dropped at a rate of 1 in 10,000 packets.  
      
     When the bearer connection uses an AAL2 CID within a multiplexed VCC 
     rather than an entire VCC, the 'ple' event is used instead of 'cle'. The 
     packets are AAL2 CPS  PDUs. 
 
     Quality alert ( "qa"): 
      
     This event indicates that the bearer path fails to  any predetermined 
     combination of quality criteria such as loss, delay, jitter etc. This 
     criterion is not defined and is left to the application. The gateway 
     reports this quality violation to the call agent if armed to do so. 
      
     Report failure ( "of (#)"): 
      
     This indicates a  connection failure. It can also indicate failure to 
     establish a connection, in lieu of "sf".   
      
     The most common response to these events is for the media gateway to 
     delete the connection. Some applications might choose to report an "of" 
     with the appropriate reason code, a decimal number, optionally included in 
     parentheses. Reason codes are the same as for spontaneous deletes by the 
     gateway. 
      
3.3. Statistics 
  
     Connection statistics reported in the MGCP connection parameters structure 
     as a result of a delete connection command are redefined for ATM. These 
     parameters are: 
      
     Number of packets sent: If a VCC is assigned to the connection, this is 
     the total number of ATM cells transmitted for the duration of the 
     connection. If a CID within an AAL2 VCC is assigned to the connection, it 
     is the number of AAL2 common part sublayer (CPS)  packets transmitted for 
     the duration of the connection. 
      
     Number of octets sent: If a VCC is assigned to the connection, this is the 
     total number of ATM payload octets transmitted for the duration of the 
     connection. If a CID within an AAL2 VCC is assigned to the connection, 
     this is the total number of AAL2 CPS payload octets transmitted for the 
     duration of the connection. 
      
     Number of packets received: If a VCC is assigned to the connection, this 
     is the total number of ATM cells received for the duration of the 
     connection. If a CID within an AAL2 VCC is assigned to the connection, it 
 
R.Kumar                      Informational                         30 
                            ATM MGCP Package             September 2001 
 
 
     is the number of AAL2 common part sublayer (CPS)  packets received for the 
     duration of the connection. 
      
     Number of octets received: If a VCC is assigned to the connection, this is 
     the total number of ATM payload octets received for the duration of the 
     connection. If a CID within an AAL2 VCC is assigned to the connection, 
     this is the total number of AAL2 CPS payload octets received for the 
     duration of the connection. 
      
     Number of packets lost: If a VCC is assigned to the connection, this is 
     the total number of ATM cells lost, for the duration of the connection, in 
     the direction towards the gateway. If a CID within an AAL2 VCC is assigned 
     to the connection, it is the number of AAL2 common part sublayer (CPS)  
     packets lost, for the duration of the connection, in the direction towards 
     the gateway. If these losses cannot be assessed, then the gateway omits 
     this parameter. 
      
     Interarrival jitter: If a VCC is assigned to the connection, this is the 
     interarrival jitter for ATM cells. If a CID within an AAL2 VCC is assigned 
     to the connection, this is the interarrival jitter for AAL2 common part 
     sublayer (CPS)  packets. If this cannot be determined, then it is omitted.  
      
     Average Transmission Delay: This should be understood to be the average 
     cell transmission delay in both cases: VCC assignment and CID assignment 
     to the connection. This requires the use of ATM performance monitoring 
     techniques. If it is not possible to assess this delay, it is omitted. 
      
     An example of connection parameter encoding for Voice-over-ATM is the 
     following: 
      
       P: PS=1245, OS=59760, PR=1244, OR=59712, PL=20, JI=0, LA=0 
      
     Note that the PL value refers to the receive direction and is unrelated to 
     PS. 
      
     As in other applications, any of these parameters can be omitted if not 
     relevant to an application. Also, the entire P: structure is optional. 
      
     If a VCC is assigned to an MGCP-controlled connection, PS, PR and PL refer 
     to cells sent, received and lost rather than to packets. OS and OR refer 
     to sent and received ATM payload octets. Interarrival jitter (JI)  is 
     understood to be for cells within the VCC. This VCC could be AAL1, AAL2 
     single-CID or AAL5. 
      
     If a CID within an AAL2 VCC is assigned to an MGCP-controlled connection, 
     PS, PR and PL refer to AAL2 common part sublayer (CPS)  packets. OS and OR 
     refer to sent and received AAL2 payload octets. Interarrival jitter (JI)  
     is understood to be for CPS packets. If this cannot be determined, the 
     interarrival jitter for cells can be substituted. 
      
     Estimation of average transmission delay (LA) is difficult in an ATM 
     network and requires elaborate performance monitoring techniques. Methods

     for measuring latency at the CID level are not standardized. If the 
     latency parameter or any other parameter cannot be determined, it is set 
     to a null value.   Zero values shall be recognized as null values for all 
     parameters in the Connection Parameters structure for ATM. 
 
4.0. Negotiation of profiles and codecs in ATM applications 
      
4.1. Consistency of parameters 
 
     For ATM networks, the "nt" local connection option in MGCP  must be set to 
     "ATM".  
 
     In any ATM application, the following Local Connection Options should not 
     be used: 
          Type of service, L: t 
          Resource reservation, L: r 
           
     This is because the Local Connection Options listed in Table 6 provide 
     information equivalent to the L: t and L: r local connection options. 
                          
     The following Local Connection Option is not meaningful in the AAL1 case 
     and should not be used: 
      
               Packetization period, L: p     
      
     In AAL2 applications, the following Local Connection Options should not be 
     used :  
 
          Encoding algorithm, L: a 
          Packetization period, L: p 
           
     The following ATM  Local Connection Options provide equivalent information 
     in the AAL2 case: 
 
          Profile list, L: atm/pfl 
          Priority list of  voice codec selections, L: atm/vsel 
          Priority list of voiceband data codec selections, L: atm/dsel 
          Priority list of fax codec selections, L: atm/fsel 
           
     The use of a disallowed local connection option can either be flagged as 
     an error or ignored. If it is flagged as an error, a return code of 510 
     (protocol error) is used. If it is ignored, it is for the sake of 
     maintaining backward compatibility in some applications. A  return code of 
     524 (inconsistent local connection options) should not be used. 
      
4.2. Codec/Profile negotiation in ATM  networks 
      
     In AAL1 and AAL5 applications, codec negotiation is similar to the IP 
     case, although some of the local connection options and SDP connection 
     descriptor parameters are  different. See [18] for conventions for the use 
     of the Session Description Protocol [26] in the ATM context. 
      
 
R.Kumar                      Informational                         32 
                            ATM MGCP Package             September 2001 
 
 
     In AAL2 applications, the L:a and L: p parameters are disallowed. Profile 
     negotiation takes the place of codec negotiation. This remainder of this  
     section addresses how this is done.  
      
     The specifics of the AAL2 bearer are not germane to profile negotiation. 
     The bearer could be PVC-based or SVC-based, based on single-CID  or multi-
     CID VCs, subcell multiplexed or not.  
      
     The most general case involves different prioritized lists of profiles at 
     the originating gateway, the terminating gateway, the originating call 
     agent and the terminating gateway. Whether these lists are based on 
     network policies, end subscriber service level agreements or equipment 
     design is immaterial to the profile negotiation that is done as part of 
     the connection establishment process. It is also irrelevant whether these 
     lists are hardcoded defaults or provisionable. In the connection 
     establishment process, a series of ordered intersections is performed. 
     This leaves a single ordered list in the end. The highest priority profile 
     in this list is the selected profile.  
      
     The call agent conveys it priority list through the pfl local connection 
     option. The gateway conveys intersection results through the media 
     information line in SDP [18]. Whether these lists imply a real priority or 
     not, a profile is always chosen before the profiles that follow it in a 
     list.  
 
     Each media gateway has a policy for assigning priorities to different 
     lists (inter-list priority) which is different from the positional 
     ordering of profiles within a list (intra-list priority). This policy 
     might be a hardcoded default or provisioned. The inter-list priority 
     specifies an ordering of the following lists when the gateway originates a 
     call, and another ordering when the gateway terminates a call: 
      
       * 'C-list', which is the priority list from the call agent,  
          received through L: atm/pfl. 
       * 'R-list', which is the priority list from the remote end,  
          received through the SDP remote connection descriptor. 
       * 'L-list', which is the local priority list, hardcoded or 
          provisioned. 
       
     This policy will vary depending on the type, capabilities and deployment 
     of the media gateway. Network administrations or equipment vendors will 
     provision/default this policy for various reasons such as resource usage 
     optimization, quality of service, likelihood of finding a common profile 
     etc. 
      
     When doing an ordered intersection of lists, the intra-list priorities of 
     the highest priority list are used. Any profile that cannot be supported 
     due to resource (bandwidth, processing power etc.) limitations is 
     eliminated from the intersection.  
 
     In the absence of one or more of these lists, the remaining list(s) are 
     used in the profile selection process.  If the call agent does not provide 
 
R.Kumar                      Informational                         33

     a list of profiles, the C-list is absent. In this case, the intersection 
     of the C-list, R-list and L-list simply becomes the intersection of the R-
     list and the L-list. If the R-list is also absent, no intersection is 
     performed and the result is this null operation is the L-list. 
      
     The process of profile negotiation is as shown below: 
      
            ORIGINATING                      TERMINATING 
             GATEWAY                           GATEWAY 
           
 (1) On receiving CRCX 
     do a policy-based ordered 
     intersection of the C-list, 
     R-list and L-list. 
                       ----------------------------------> 
                       (2)Send resulting ordered list 
                          to the terminating gateway 
                          via SDP. 
                                                 
                                             (3) On receiving CRCX do 
                                                 a policy-based  
                                                 ordered 
                                                 intersection of the  
                                                 C-list, R-list and  
                                                 L-list. 
                                             (4) The highest priority 
                                                 profile in the  
                                                 resulting 
                                                 list is the  
                                                 selected 
                                                  profile. 
                            <----------------------------------- 
                             (5) Send selected profile  
                                 to the originating gateway 
                                 via SDP. 
                             (6) Optionally, send vsel, dsel,  
                                 and fsel via SDP to map  
                                 profile rows into service 
                                 types. 
                                                                                      
     When connection establishment is complete, there is only one profile 
     associated with a connection. This implies that both endpoints are ready 
     to receive, on the fly, packets that comply with any row in the profile. 
     This can be restricted in some applications to map profile rows into voice 
     service, voiceband data (modem) service and fax service. This binding can 
     be by default, through provisioning or as part of profile negotiation 
     during call establishment. 
      
     One way of mapping profile rows to service types (voice, voiceband data 
     and facsimile) on a call-by-call basis is to let the terminating gateway 
     make this decision. In step 6 of the call flow above, it   
 
R.Kumar                      Informational                         34

     indicates it to the originating gateway via SDP vsel, dsel and fsel media 
     attribute lines [18].  
      
     Another way is to let the call agent(s) determine it and communicate it to 
     the gateways as vsel, dsel and fsel LCOs. 
      
     In addition, call agents and the originating gateway can indicate their 
     preferred mapping of  profile rows to service types with respect to  the 
     highest priority profile listed. This is done through the vsel, dsel and 
     fsel LCOs and media attribute lines. When one profile is selected, the 
     originating gateway is obliged to honor any mapping of profile rows to 
     service types provided by the terminating gateway. Additionally, such a  
     mapping can be suggested by call agents and media gateways prior to this 
     step (i.e. prior to  step 6 in the call flow above), but the recipients 
     are not obliged to honor these suggestions. 
      
     Examples of profile negotiation: 
      
       
     The L-list  at gateway #1, which is the originating gateway in this 
     example,  is: 
       custom 100, itu 7, itu 1, itu 2 
      
     The L-list  at gateway #2, which is the terminating gateway in this 
     example,  is: 
        itu 2, itu 7, itu 1, itu 5 
      
     The originating call agent sends the following profile list (C-list) to 
     the originating gateway in the first create connection command: 
         itu 8, itu 9, atmf 7, itu 7, itu 1, custom 100 
      
     There is no remote connection descriptor, hence no R-list. The policy for 
     originating calls at gateway #1 is: 
         C-List > R-list > L-list 
      
     where '>' means 'has higher priority than'. In accordance with this 
     policy, the originating gateway performs an ordered intersection of the C-
     list and the L-list to produce: 
          itu 7, itu 1, custom 100 
      
     It sends this result via the SDP remote session descriptor. This becomes 
     the R-list for gateway #2. The terminating call agent sends the following 
     profile list (C-list) to the terminating  gateway in the first create 
     connection command: 
         itu 1, itu 4,   itu 7, custom 110, custom 100, itu 2 
      
     The policy for gateway #2 is: 
          R-list > L-list > C-list 
      
     Using this policy, gateway #2 produces the following ordered intersection 
     of R-list, L-list and C-list: 
          itu 7, itu 1 
 
R.Kumar                      Informational                         35 
                            ATM MGCP Package             September 2001 
 
 
      
     The first profile in this list, itu 7, is to be used for this connection. 
     Gateway 2 indicates this to the call agent through the SDP local 
     connection descriptor. Along with it,  is sends the following SDP media 
     attribute lines to indicate the use of the different profile rows [18]: 
        
          a=vsel:G729 10 10 
          a=dsel:on PCMU 40 5 
          
     These lines map voice (vsel) and voiceband data (dsel) to rows in the 
     profile itu 7. The "on" in the dsel line indicates that voiceband data 
     includes fax, otherwise a separate fsel line would be used. 
      
     If the call agent(s) make(s) this decision, then the originating call 
     agent can send the following LCOs in the modify connection command that 
     has the selected profile in its remote connection descriptor: 
               L: atm/vsel:G729 10 10, dsel: G729 10 10, fsel:G729 10 10 
      
     In this case, the terminating call agent can send the vsel, dsel and fsel 
     options in another modify connection command to the terminating gateway.
