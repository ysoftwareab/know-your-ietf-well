                Simple DNS Queries and Responses in JSON
                     draft-hoffman-simplednsjson-00

Abstract

   This document describes a JSON-based format for simple DNS queries
   and responses.  In this case, "simple" means "only useful for getting
   A and AAAA records".  This document also defines the application/
   simpledns+json media type.  The primary use case of this format is
   programs that do not want to take on the programmatic overhead needed
   to use messages in the application/dns-udpwireformat media type.

   mailing list at https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/dnsoverhttp .

1.  Introduction

   This document also defines the application/simpledns+json media type.
   The data format in this media type allows clients to ask for the DNS
   [RFC1035] address records (A and AAAA records) for a domain name, and
   get back just the basic answer information.  The contents of the
   message are in JSON [RFC7159].

   The primary use case of this format is programs that do not want to
   take on the programmatic overhead needed to use messages in the
   application/dns-udpwireformat media type.  Data in application/
   simpledns+json is a JSON object with very few members in the query or
   in the response, whereas using the application/dns-udpwireformat
   requires a program to be able to assemble and disassemble full DNS
   messages.  Queries using application/simpledns+json only let the
   program ask for IP address, while queries using application/dns-
   udpwireformat allow any asking for any DNS data type, and using any
   DNS extension.

   The application/simpledns+json format is expected to be useful in
   HTTP, such as the protocol described in [I-D.hoffman-dns-over-https].

Internet-Draft             Simple DNS in JSON                  June 2017


1.1.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

2.  Using the Simple JSON DNS Query Format in HTTP

   When used in HTTP or similar protocols, the media type for carrying
   the data described here is "application/simpledns+json".  The body of
   the query, and the contents of the response, are JSON objects.  The
   definition of those objects is given here, but the query and response
   objects MAY have other elements that are either defined later or are
   based on local implementation decisions.

3.  Queries

   The structure of a query is:

   { "name": str,
     "type": str
   }

   The "name" member MUST be present in queries.  The "type" member is
   optional in queries.

   The name is given as a host name; IDNs [RFC5890] are expressed in
   Punycode [RFC3492].

   The type is given as a string, and one of the following three values
   MUST be used: "A", "AAAA", and "A-and-AAAA".  If the "type" member is
   not included, a server treats the query as if it was for "A-and-
   AAAA".

4.  Responses

   The structure of a response is:

   { "code": int,
     "v4": [ zero or more addresses as strs ],
     "v6": [ zero or more addresses as strs ]
   }

   The "code" member MUST be present in responses.  The "v4" and "v6"
   members are optional in responses.

   The value for "code" MUST be one of the following:

   0: The name exists.  This does not mean that A or AAAA records exist,
      just that the name exists.  This code can be treated similarly to
      a NOERROR response in DNS.

   1: The name does not exist.  This code can be treated similarly to a
      NXDOMAIN response in DNS.

   2: Service failure.  This code can be treated similarly to a SERVFAIL
      response in DNS.

   If they are included, the "v4" and "v6" members MUST each contain a
   list of strings, with each string representing a single address.

5.  Example

   For example, assume a DNS API server is following this specification
   on origin https://dnsserver.example.net/ and the well-known path.
   The examples uses HTTP/2 formatting from [RFC7540].

   A query for the IN A records for "www.example.com" with recursion
   turned on using the GET method with the wireformat would be:

   :method = GET
   :scheme = https
   :authority = dnsserver.example.net
   :path = /.well-known/dns-query?
           content-type=application/simpledns+json&  (no CR)
           { "name": "www.example.com", "type": "A" }
   accept = application/simpledns+json

   [[ Does anything in that preceding example need to be escaped or
   quoted? ]]

   The response might be:

   :status = 200
   content-type = application/simpledns+json
   content-length = 34
   cache-control = max-age=128

   {"code":0, "v4":["93.184.216.34"]}
