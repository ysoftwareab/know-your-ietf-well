1.  Introduction

   The purpose of network system configuration is to allow the
   deployment of services requested by customers across networks.
   Essentially, these services are built from a combination of network
   elements and protocol configuration.  However, they are presented to
   service customers in a more abstract way.

   To facilitate service automation control and configuration more
   automatic and much simpler manner, service models are proposed and
   specified in IETF to help customers express their service
   requirements as well as operators configure their networks per these
   requirements.  As a starting point, L3 VPN Service Model (L3SM)
   working group is working on such a service model.  [I-D.bogdanovic-
   netmod-yang-model-classification] discusses YANG model layering which
   lays a good foundation for L3SM service model work.

Internet-Draft       Service Automation Architecture        October 2015


   The L3VPN Service Model (L3SM) [I-D.ietf-l3sm-l3vpn-service-model] is
   aimed to provide an abstracted view of a Layer 3 IP VPN service
   configuration components, which can further break down into the data
   into specific Network Element models to configure the participating
   network elements to perform the service . It is more focused on the
   characteristics of the L3VPN service itself which should be specified
   in the service data model, while little description of the service
   model usage, i.e., interacting with other control plane component to
   configure the network.

   This document describes a generic architecture of the service
   automation management to use service models such as L3SM across the
   network.  The generic SAM architecture is to explain the role of the
   service model, such as L3 VPN Service Model (L3SM), used in the
   network and how it can be further processed and deployed onto network
   nodes to realize the customer service.

   This document can help service model developers and network operators
   better understand the usage of service model and how it can be
   deployed in their networks.

1.1.  Objectives

   The purpose of this service-automation management architecture is to
   provide an outline of how service models from customer applications
   can be processed and translated into configurations of network
   elements and protocols, so as to realize the customer requested
   service.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Generic Architecture for service automation management (SAM)

3.1.  SAM architecture

   Figure 1 illustrates a generic architecture for the service
   automation management.  The components and functional interfaces are
   further discussed in Sections 3.2 and 3.3, respectively.  It is
   important to understand that the relationships and interfaces shown
   between components in this figure are focused on the instantiation of
   service configuration onto network elements.

   The translation from service model into a set of network
   configurations is done by the Customer Service Orchestrator
   (CSO),Conf Manager and Network Service Orchestrator.  Further, the
   translated configuration/control data is signaled using XML based
   encoding and YANG module onto involved network elements.

3.2.  Functions Components

   This section describes the functional components shown as boxes in
   Figure 1.  The interactions between those components, the functional
   interfaces are described in Section 3.3.

3.2.1.  APPs

   Within the service automation management architecture, an APP may
   issue high-level service requests to the Customer Service
   Orchestrator which indicates the network service from customer.  It
   may also establish policies for the activities of the components
   within the architecture.

   The APP will use service model to carry service characteristics
   parameters and inject thismodel into the Customer Service
   Orchestrator.

3.2.2.  Customer Service Orchestrator (CSO)

   The Customer Service Orchestrator is a service component and used by
   service customers to communicate with the network management
   system(e.g.,OSS) to request operations on the network.

   The Customer Service Orchestrator will also interact with the network
   service Orchestrator or Conf Manager to control, operate, and manage
   a network.

   Besides, it might also needs to work with OSS or control plane to get
   network capability information, network requirement information and
   Network Planning information(e.g., route target).

   The Customer Service Orchestrator will use service model sent from
   APP as input and network planning information from OSS or network
   capability information from Control plane and translate them to
   orchestrated configuration (e.g., Technology independent network
   element configuration or Technology dependent Network element
   configuration)of network elements who will be part of the service.

3.2.3.  Network Service Orchestrator (NSO)

   The network Service Orchestrator is a configuration component and
   used to control, operate, and manage a network in more scalable way.
   It can interact with the Customer Service Orchestrator to get
   orchestrated configuration of network nodes(e.g., Technology
   independent Network element configuration).  In this way, it allows
   the customer service orchestrator to distribute the technology
   independent network configurations for service model in a more
   general way without equipped with various protocols for different
   network device configurations.

   For a Network Service Orchestrator, it can comprise several different
   type of Controller, e.g., ODL Controller, ONOS Controller, ABNO
   Controller, I2RS Controller, SDN Controller), each of which is able

   to install various different protocols described in section 3.4 for
   configuration of different network devices.

   The Conf Manager also can be part of the network service orchestrator
   and used to control, operate, and manage a network as a whole
   dedicatedly Using Netconf protocol.

3.2.4.  OSS

   OSS applies to legacy software based platform used by service
   provider to support and manage network operations helping with
   plan,build, operate and optimize the networks.  OSS systems support
   network management functions such as network inventory.  OSS systems
   will interact with Customer Service Orchestrator and provide Network
   inventory information and network planning informationsuch as route
   target to Customer Service Orchestrator as input to generate
   orchestrated configuration of network elements.

3.2.5.  Devices

   Devices can be routers, but also servers (like AAA),while not limited
   to these examples.  The configuration of network devices may be done
   by CLI, or by NetConf/RestConf coupled with specific configuration
   YANG data models (BGP, VRF, BFD ...) or any other way by the Network
   Service Orchestrator in section 3.2.3 or the Customer Service
   Orchestrator in section 3.2.2.

3.3.  Functional Interfaces

   This section describes the main interfaces between functional
   components involved in service automation control and configuration
   that might be used in an realization of customer services.  As noted
   in section 2.2, interfaces shown between components in Figure 1 are
   illustrative and focused on service automation and configuration
   based on service model.  It is assumed that existing protocols can
   provide all of the capabilities.  The discussion of new protocols for
   these capabilities is out of scope.

3.3.1.  C1: Service Level interface

   The north-bound Service Level interfaces to the customer service
   orchestrator (CSO) are used by applications.  With the service level
   interface, customers can request customer network service with
   various service requirements needed in the network.  The interface
   will also need to be able to report the asynchronous completion of
   service requests and convey changes in the status of services, but
   these status information are not necessary to be carried by service
   model.

Internet-Draft       Service Automation Architecture        October 2015


3.3.2.  C2: Network Wide Interface

   The network Level orchestrator is used to provide network
   configuration on the network for customer services by operators.  In
   this case, the network Wide interface from the customer service
   orchestrator is introduced.

   After the customer service orchestrator maps the service model of the
   requested network service into network configuration data, it sends
   out the configuration data onto network service orchestrator via the
   network wide interface while leaving the detailed protocol-related
   configuration of involved network devices, such as routers and AAA,
   to the network service orchestrator itself.  Note that Network Wide
   Interface can be an internal interface between Customer Service
   Orchestrator and Network service orchestrator.  That is to say,
   Customer Service orchestrator is collocated with Network service
   orchestrator or Conf Manager.

3.3.3.  C3: Device Level Interface

   Upon receiving a orchestrated network configuration data from the
   Network Service Orchstrator, the network service orchestrator or Conf
   Manager further configures the managed network devices by using
   corresponding protocols (See section 3.4) via the device level
   interfaces.

3.3.4.  C4: Network Level OSS facing interface

   By using these configuration interfaces, the Customer Service
   Orchestrator can interact with OSS and get planning information or
   verify whether the network resource can meet service requirements in
   the service model by looking up network capability provided by OSS
   and determine appropriate network level configuration parameters.

3.4.  Candidate Network Configuration Management Protocols

   As noted in 3.2, the Customer Service Orchestrator,Network Service
   Orchestrator, Conf Manager is to install corresponding protocols to
   exchange information with involved network devices.  Many protocols
   already exist to perform these functions, including the following:

   o  SNMP [RFC3412]

   o  The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) [RFC6241]

   o  RESTCONF [RESTCONF]

   o  The General Switch Management Protocol (GSMP) [RFC3292]

   o  ForCES [RFC5810]

   o  OpenFlow [ONF]

   o  PCEP [PCE-Init-LSP]

3.5.  Relation between service model and network model

   Service Models are created to describe the characteristics of a
   service, as agreed upon with consumers of that service while Network
   Models describe the configuration, state data and operations of a
   network protocol/general device.  For more
   details on difference between service model and network model, please
