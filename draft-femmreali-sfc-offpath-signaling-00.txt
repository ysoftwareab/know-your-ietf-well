         Off-Path Signaling Protocol for Service Function Chaining
                 draft-femmreali-sfc-offpath-signaling-00


Abstract

   This document illustrates a reference protocol able to discover
   deployed instances of Service Functions (SFs), which can be located
   also off-path with respect to the IP datapath between flow source
   and flow destination. It is an application protocol organized in two
   layers: signaling transport, which deal lower layer signaling
   transport, and signaling application, which directly interfaces with
   the intended SF. Discovery of SFs is a primary step to for
   implementing Service Function Chaining (SFC).

1. Introduction

   Service Function Chaining (SFC) enables the creation of composite
   services that consist of an ordered set of Service Functions (SF)
   that are be applied to packet flows as a result of classification.
   SFC is a concept that provides for more than just the application of

   an ordered set of SFs to selected traffic; rather, it describes a
   method for deploying SFs in a way that enables dynamic ordering and
   topological independence of those SFs as well as the exchange of
   metadata between participating entities. Foundations of the SFC are
   described in below documents:

   o SFC problem statement [3].

   o Various individual drafts.

   SFs is an area that has recently gained attention as one of the most
   successful novelty in networking research. Many essential functions
   can be virtualized, such as security functions (firewalling,
   intrusion detection, traffic scrubbing), shaping functions (rate
   limiting, load balancing), addressing, caching, and middlebox
   management [4][5]. The strategic importance of SF is also
   demonstrated by the related ongoing standardization activities. For
   example, in addition to the IETF SFC Working Group, in 2012 seven
   leading network operators selected ETSI to host the Industry
   Specification Group for Network Function Virtualization (NFV) [6].
   Furthermore, the IETF Service Function Chaining (SFC) working group
   has been addressing strictly related functions since mid 2014.
   Another related effort is the IETF Network Virtualization Overlays
   (nvo3) working group. Since mid 2012, the nvo3 working group has
   been dealing with solutions for supporting multi-tenancy in data
   centers managing virtualized hosts. The considered approaches reside
   at the network layer and aim at deploying Data Center Virtual
   Private Network (DCVPN) across a range from thousands to millions of
   virtual machines (VMs) with good scaling properties. In addition,
   the IEEE has recently standardized the Next Generation Service
   Overlay Network (NGSON), including entities for service composition
   and routing. Their combination allows combining computing services
   and routing for data communications [9]. In [7], the authors address
   the problem of composing SFs automatically and propose a formal
   representation of the semantics of data connections, along with the
   relevant functions and policies.

   The common aspect of all these activities is the collection and
   joint management of network resources distributed over geographical
   networks and made available through a virtualized interface. Thus,
   SF resource discovery is a critical aspect preliminary to all the
   mentioned proposals, and not enough considered so far in the
   technical literature. A survey the research developments in the
   closely related area of service discovery for realizing NaaS
   (Network as a Service) to support network-cloud convergence can be
   found in [9]. However, in the perspective of a service composition
   through SFs, the importance of the resource awareness is higher when


Femminella et al.,   Expires September 23, 2015               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft   Off-Path Signaling Protocol for SFC        March 2015


   resources are located close to data paths, so that they can be
   considered candidate for implementing or adapting service delivery.

   To sum up, even if a number of proposals for virtualized SF/NFV
   exists, however, some management issues are still unexplored. One
   issue is the discovery of SF instances. Another issue is that is it
   often desirable to maintain the SF instances sufficiently close to
   IP data paths. The first issue is related to deployments of SF
   instances in clouds, where they could be moved and/or replicated.
   The second one refers to chaining NFV instances while keeping
   acceptable the increase of network traffic.

   This document describes the off-path signaling protocol (OSP),
   designed for distributing signaling messages over portions of data
   networks around data paths (configurable network scope). The main
   issue that is addressed by this document is the need of discovering
   network nodes, hosting virtualized SFs, within network scopes
   destined to deploy a wide class of services. The protocol is
   designed to be distributed, autonomic, and easy to deploy solution.
   This protocol leverages on two main network functions, namely, on-
   path packet interception and off-path signaling distribution [8].

   Specifically, this document provides:

   o a survey of the existing signaling protocols that could be
      regarded as alternative solutions to OSP and currently available
      NFV platforms to implements virtualized SFs.

   o a formal description of the OSP protocol, by using finite state
      machine diagrams.

1.1. Document scope

3. Related work

3.1. Signaling protocols in data network

   This section illustrates the mostly used signaling protocols in data
   network and evaluate their suitability in accomplishing the desired
   functions for resource discovery of SFs.

   A special mention is due to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP,
   IETF RFC 3261, [19]), an application-layer signaling protocol. It is
   the protocol mostly used for establishing multimedia sessions over
   IP networks. Although its diffusion is an attractive property, its
   intrinsic end-to-end scope, assisted by intermediate proxies, makes
   its usage unfeasible for the aims of this paper.

   The REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) protocol, specified by
   the ITEF RFC 6940 [20], extends the SIP capabilities by introducing
   peer-to-peer (P2P) message exchange. Nevertheless, on-path packet
   interception is not present. This (missing) feature does not allow
   to properly identify SFs which are deployed around a data path.

   Also protocols for high volume messaging, such as eXtensible
   Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP, IETF RFC 6120 [21]) or
   similar, are unsuitable, since they rely on a client-server
   architecture, and clients may not exchange messages directly to one
   another. Also in these protocols, features allowing to properly
   identify SFs which are deployed around a data path are missing.

   The EvoArch evolutionary model, presented in [10], shows that in
   order to design protocol having a significant change to survive over
   time, it is necessary either to replace an incumbent one, by
   including similar services and significant novelties, or to make
   them largely non-overlapping, in terms of features, with existing
   and largely used ones. In terms of features and capabilities, the
   Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS, IETF RFC 4080 [22]) architecture
   partially addresses the needs of the SFs resource discovery. In
   fact, NSIS was defined for signaling information about a data flow
   along its path in the network, in order to allows signaling
   applications to install and manage states in the network though on-
   path packet interception. It consists of two layers, namely, NSIS
   transport layer protocol (NTLP), which is a generic lower layer used
   for on-path node discovery and message sending, and NSIS signaling
   layer protocol (NSLP), the upper layer implementing specific
   signaling application logic. The IETF-defined version of the NTLP is
   the General Internet Signaling Transport protocol (GIST, IETF RFC
   5971 [23]). It allows sending signaling messages either towards an
   explicit destination or path-coupled, that allows installing states


Femminella et al.,   Expires September 23, 2015               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft   Off-Path Signaling Protocol for SFC        March 2015


   in all the NSIS peers that lie on the path between two end points.
   GIST does not support off-path signaling. Nevertheless, it includes
   extensibility functions, that have been used to introduce an off-
   path routing support [12]. The weakness of this solution consists of
   the complexity of the NSIS architecture, which has hampered its
   widespread adoption.

3.2. Platforms for hosting virtualized SFs

   Some recently developed research platforms able to host SF in a
   virtualized fashion through deployment in the cloud are reported
   below. Given likely deployment in clouds, they could benefit of the
   functions provided by OSP.

   o NetVM: a high-speed network packet processing platform,
      implemented by using the Intel's DPDK library [13]. It provides
      capabilities for traffic steering network function chaining.

   o ClickOS: a Xen-based virtualized platform optimized for middlebox
      processing [4]. It can execute hundreds of middleboxes on
      commodity hardware.

   o NetServ: it is a programmable node platform designed for
      deploying in-network services [11]. It includes in-network
      virtualized service containers and a common execution environment
      for both network services and traditional addressable services
      (e.g. a Web server).

   o OpenANFV: a platform designed to consolidate various hardware
      resources [14]. It is programmable and supports virtualized
      acceleration for middleboxes in a cloud environment.

   o OpenNF: it is a control plane architecture including a set of
      APIs managing combination of events and forwarding updates to
      address race conditions, accommodating different network
      functions [15].

3.3. Service redirect solutions

   Traffic redirection is a research area strongly related to NFV. It
   essentially consists of implementing service paths, different from
   data paths, by means of tunnels. It is worth mentioning the Network
   Service Header [16] solution proposed by the IETF SFC working group,
   which allows forming service paths, which transport not only data
   traffic but also configuration metadata.

Internet-Draft   Off-Path Signaling Protocol for SFC        March 2015


   Another interesting solution, based on the software defined network
   paradigm, is shown in [17].

4. Off-path Signaling Protocol description

   The definition of OSP was inspired by the design and implementation
   experience of designing an off-path extension of GIST [12]. The new
   signaling protocol includes all the necessary features of NSIS while
   removing all the components that have been demonstrated to be
   scarcely acceptable. In addition, following the guidelines of the
   EvoArch evolutionary model [10], the protocol natively integrate new
   features, such as the support for off-path signaling, the importance
   which was still not well understood at the time of the NSIS
   introduction. In more detail, the protocol architecture inherits
   some of the key features of two existing solutions which compensate
   each other's shortcomings. These solutions are the NSIS protocol
   architecture and P2P gossip message exchange [18]. In addition, some
   key features, suitable to support NFV needs, have been included.
   They are listed below.

   NSIS inheritance:

   o Two-layer protocol organization. The upper layer of the OSP
      architecture, called Signaling Application (SA), implements the
      application signaling logic. The lower layer, called Signaling
      Transport (ST), distributes the SA messages to the intended
      recipients.

   o On-path packet interception capability, available at ST, to
      assist off-path operation at ST. Packet interception can be
      implemented in a number of ways (port-based traffic filtering,
      RAO IP option, specific rules in OpenFlow switches, and so on),
      which are implementation specific and thus out of the scope of
      this document.

   P2P gossip protocols inheritance:

   o Randomized, gossip-based message exchange, used for peer
      discovery in ST.

   o Robustness (no single point of failure) due to distributed nature
      of the protocol and scalability.

   New features:

   o Simplified state definition in ST in comparison to the many state
      variables organized in multiple tables of GIST.


Femminella et al.,   Expires September 23, 2015               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft   Off-Path Signaling Protocol for SFC        March 2015


   o Off-path signaling capability as native function.

   The OSP natively extends the path-coupled operation of GIST with
   off-path signaling, and without including all complexity of GIST due
   to the initial support of QoS network protocols currently unused.

   The combination mentioned above allows also avoiding the
   shortcomings of the P2P-based approaches, which offer little or no
   support to proximity-based solutions, trying instead to limit the
   network overhead.

   In order to implement the off-path signaling distribution functions,
   the OSP protocol defines, at the lower layer (ST), a peer discovery
   function, which identifies neighboring nodes running the OSP
   protocol. This function allows building a peer table, which is used
   during the signaling distribution in the ST layer itself.

4.1. The peer discovery in the Signaling Transport layer

   Peer discovery is a function which allows building peer tables,
   which are data structures used in the off-path signaling
   distribution. It is implemented in the ST layer. The peer discovery
   is used both to collect identity of peers and to measure IP distance
   and latency between them. It exploits the interception capabilities
   inherited from NSIS and the flexibility of gossiping.

   Each ST node stores information on the previously discovered ST
   nodes in the Peer Table (PeT). Each PeT entry stores the following
   information:

   o the unique identifier of a ST node, called Peer Identity (PID),

   o its IP address,

   o metric values, consisting of its IP hop distance and of its
      estimated round-trip network latency,

   o the timestamp of the last gossip session with the peer,

   o a boolean flag used to mark if the initiator has tried to
      contacted or contacted that peer.

   An example of PeT is reported in Figure 1.

                     Figure 1 Example of a Peer Table.

   The communicating protocol entities of the ST gossip discovery
   process are the initiator, which aims to collect information about
   the other peers, and the responder. The collected information
   includes the position of responder, which is considered relative to
   the initiator, and the identities of other peers, shared by the
   responder, as it typically happens in gossip protocols

   The protocol is asynchronous and round based. When an ST node is
   turned on, it does not store any information on the reachable ST
   nodes. It is only aware of a default node called tracker, used to
   receive an initial set of peers. Then, an ST node tries to
   periodically establish gossip sessions with the known peers to
   discover further ST nodes. The messages used for this discovery are
   Registration (REG), RegResponse (RES), and Ack (ACK). Only
   Registration messages can be intercepted.

   In order to limit the network overhead, the considered scope
   extension of each node is 1 ST hops. All Registration messages are
   intercepted and dropped by the first ST node on path (responder), as
   the message sent by N2 to TR in Figure 2. The responder replies with
   a RegResponse, followed by a final Ack. Registrations and
   RegResponses include one or more PIDs, together with one of their IP
   addresses. This list forms the peer to share list (PTS). The PTS
   peer selection is random. . The time evolution of the activity of a
   set of peer is illustrated in Figure 2. In each message, in addition
   to the message type (REG, RES, or ACK), it is indicated within ()
   the destination identity and the list of PIDs in the transported
   PTS. TR indicates the tracker. The tracker node can be configured in
   the OSP configuration file, or retrieved through properly set up
   information services, which are out of the scope of this document.

Internet-Draft   Off-Path Signaling Protocol for SFC        March 2015


   When an initiator receives the RegResponse, it stores the identity
   of the responder in its PeT, along with the relevant measured
   metrics, and the flag is set to 1, which indicates that the
   responder has been contacted. In case of interception of
   Registration by another ST node (responder), the flag associated
   with the destination peer is set to 1, whereas its relevant metric
   values are set to a non-significant value (e.g. -1). It means that
   the destination is out of scope (unreachable). The identity of the
   intercepting responder is added/updated as a contacted peer (see
   Figure 2, gossip registration of N2 to the tracker intercepted and
   answered by N3).

   In order to compute its IP distance to the responder in the
   downstream direction, the initiator carries the original value of
   the IP TTL used at the IP layer (ST-HOP field in the ST payload).
   The intercepting node, which acts as a responder, reads the current
   values of the IP TTL, and inserts the ST-HOP, decremented by the IP
   TTL, into the Gossip-Response, thus communicating the IP distance in
   the downstream direction (initiator->responder).

   By using this procedure, the initiator can also estimate the round
   trip latency to the responding node. The Ack message notifies the
   responder of the reception of the PTS by the initiator.

   Each peer whose identity was discovered by receiving it in a PTS and
   not by interception has the flag temporarily set to 0 (uncontacted).
   The selection of the peer to gossip (i.e., the destination of the
   Registration) is random, giving higher priority to those peers whose
   flag in the PeT is still 0.

   Each peer element in the PeT is associated with a lifetime, in order
   to cope with variable topology networks, where SF instances can
   migrate. Still uncontacted entries can be removed according to the
   Least Recently Used eviction policy.

   The structure of gossip messages are shown in Figure 3, according to
   the ABNF format [2]. The following fields are used:

   o Message Type: identifies the type of the message (REG, RES,
        ACK).

   o Peer Identity: uniquely identifies a ST peer. Each ST message
        must carry a source and a destination Peer-Identity.

   o Source IP address: this field contains the IP address of the node
        that forged the packet. In the Registration message contains
        the IP address of the gossip initiator, and can be used by the
        intercepting nodes to address their responses. In the Response
        message it contains the IP address of the intercepting node,
        and can be stored by the initiator in its peer table.

   o Session-Identifier: uniquely identifies the signaling session, it
        allows distinguishing messages belonging to different gossip
        rounds.

   o Metric value: this value has the following syntax: in the
        Registration message the field replicates the value set in the
        TTL field of the IP header by the IP Layer. In the RegResponse
        message the value specifies the IP distance from the Source
        Peer to the Destination Peer. The Destination Peer computes
        this value after reading the Metric Value and the residual IP
        TTL value in the Registration message.

   o IP address type: the version number of the IP address of the
        shared peer, IPv4 or IPv6.

   o IP address: one of the IP addresses of the shared peer.

4.2. Signaling distribution

   The distribution function is jointly implemented in both ST and SA
   layers, through suitable communication primitives, which confine
   transport issues at the ST layer, and decision logic at the SA
   layer. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, and Figure 7 show the finite
   state  machines  (FSMs)  of  SA  and  ST  entities,  initiator  and
   forwarder, respectively. In these diagrams, transition edges are
   labeled with the transition label. A detailed explanation of these
   transitions,  including  the  triggering  event  and  the  triggered
   actions, is reported immediately below the relevant figure.

   The SA behavior is modeled by using three states: IDLE, Wait
   Notification, and Wait Responses. This state definition is flexible
   enough to adapt to many different SA protocols, but it is also easy
   enough to allow integrating with SF instances easily.

   The ST FSM is slightly more complex, since it has to deal with lower
   layer issues, including packet interception and peer selection.

   The  signaling  distribution  allows  disseminating  signaling  over
   network  regions  of  nearly  arbitrary  shape.  By  leveraging  the
   interception  capabilities  of  ST,  this  signaling  dissemination
   protocol is highly efficient, and may allow finding resources which
   are close to a given network path. Since SF instances in data
   centers could not be on the IP path connecting two communicating
   entities (just routers are on path), only a signaling protocol with
   off-path discovery capabilities can find reachable SF resources,
   which helps limiting network traffic.

   The off-path domain considered in this document is the so-called
   hose domain, which includes the ST nodes staying within a maximum
   distance (expressed in IP hops or in latency units) from at least
   one of the nodes of the IP data path, which can be regarded as the
   axis of the hose. This distance will be referred to as the radius of
   the hose. If the sender and destination are the same node, then the
   hose collapses into a spherical region around that node. To simplify
   the description, in what follows the IP hop count is the selected
   metric.

   At the ST layer, the off-path signaling distribution adopts a
   flooding algorithm, which makes use of two main sets of peers. The
   peers laying on the IP path between the initiator and the signaling
   destination (on-path peers), and the peers laying within a distance
   of radius IP hops from the path (off-path peers).

   The signaling exchange is always initiated by the SA protocol,
   triggered by an external application (transition from IDLE to Wait
   Notification in the SA FSM of the initiator in Figure 4). This
   translates into a command received from the ST layer of the
   initiator (transition from IDLE to ACTIVE in the ST FSM of the
   initiator, Figure 6). The signaling initiator generates an initial
   query message, by setting both the desired values of hose radius and
   a dedicated on-path flag in the message header, and sends it to the
   signaling  destination.  This  flag  marks  the  signaling  messages
   delivered through the axis of the hose. Queries, such as Gossip-
   Registration in the gossip discovery, are intercepted by the other
   ST nodes. This happens for on-path queries. Each node receiving an
   on-path query must accept the peering request by a response message
   and be ready to receive SA data from the upstream node (transition
   from IDLE to On-path Forwarder in the ST FSM of the forwarder,
   Figure 7). Upon receiving these data, they are sent to the SA (loop
   on On-path Forwarder in Figure 7 and transition from IDLE to Wait
   Notification in Figure 5). Then, the SA layer triggers the ST layer
   to deliver the signaling message not only on-path, but also to nodes
   at a metric value lower than the hose radius received in the query,
   namely off-path ST nodes. The relevant pseudo-code of the algorithm

   executed at the ST layer to implement the flooding approach is shown
   in Figure 8. It uses the information stored in the PeT, an example
   of which is shown in Figure 1. For each selected peer, the ST node
   generates a new query and decrements the query radius by the peer
   metric. In addition, the on-path flag is set to 0. The new queries
   are then sent to all the selected peers. Clearly, the upstream ST
   node is not selected for off-path distribution.

   At this time, the ST layer notifies the SA and performs a transition
   towards the Active state (On-path or Off-path, Figure 7), waiting
   for responses from the queried peers. In turn, the SA FSM moves into
   the Wait Responses state (both Figure 4 and Figure 5), and creates a
   stack data structure to store data responses, which are expected
   during the signaling responses traveling back towards the initiator.

   At the ST layer, when positive responses are received by queried
   peers in Active states, data are delivered to them (loops on Active
   states in Figure 7 and on ACTIVE in Figure 6).

   The fields used in ST distribution messages are:

   o On-path flag: this flag has the following meaning: the value 1
        indicates that the peering request must be accepted in any
        case, it must be acknowledged with a Response and any other
        signaling session for the same id must be aborted. The value 0
        indicates that the peering request can be accepted or rejected
        according to the ST layer status (see Figure 6 and Figure 7).

   o Metric Type: specifies the type of the metric used to define the
        off-path radius (IP hop, latency, other to be defined).

   o Radius: specifies the radius of the off-path distribution.

   o Error code: specifies the type of the error.

   o SA-Identifier: uniquely identifies a SA with the following
        syntax: the first n bits identify the SF type (i.e., cache,
        firewall, proxy, etc...), the second m bits identify the SF
        platform.

Internet-Draft   Off-Path Signaling Protocol for SFC        March 2015


   o SA-Payload: the opaque SA message transported by the ST.

4.2.3. Error management and termination procedures

   When a node receives an off-path query, it reads the radius value.
   If this value is greater than 1, it iterates the same procedure
   illustrated  above  in  order  to  select  the  set  of  signaling
   destinations to be included in the distribution set. The relevant
   transition in the ST state machine is from IDLE to Off-path
   Forwarder, as shown in Figure 7. In order to avoid the packet
   duplication problem, typical of flooding algorithms when the network
   topology includes cycles, an ST error message was introduced to
   limit  overhead.  In  more  detail,  when  a  forwarder  receives  a
   signaling message, it creates an internal soft state for the
   signaling session storing: the identifier of the served SA protocol,
   the session identifier, the upstream PID, and the radius of the
   latest processed query. Then, if it receives a further ST off-path
   query from another peer, with the same set of values and a hose
   radius lower than the stored one, it replies by sending an error
   message, rejecting the peering request (error loops on all states
   except IDLE in Figure 6 and Figure 7), and the ErrorCount variable,
   set to 0 at session state creation, is incremented. Instead, if the
   hose radius is higher than the stored one, the previous session is
   aborted, the SA is notified (transition to IDLE in Figure 7), and a
   new session is created at ST (transition to Off-path Forwarder in
   Figure 7).

   Similarly, when an off-path node receives an on-path query, it must
   abort the previous session and establishes a new one, now acting as
   an on-path node. In this case, the SA is also notified and the
   relevant states are deleted. The relevant transitions on Figure 7
   are those from off-path states to On-path Forwarder.

   When the ST layer realizes that it cannot further forward the query,
   according to the algorithm in Figure 8, it starts transmitting the
   data responses back to the initiator, by notifying the relevant SA
   layer with empty data, and moves back into the Off-path Forwarder
   state (Figure 7). The SA layer queries the local SF instance and
   adds its response to the stack with depth equal to 0, and triggers
   the underlying ST to transmit upstream the data response. Session
   state at SA is cleared, and the FSM returns into the IDLE state.
   When the ST receives this command from the above SA, it sends
   upstream the data response, clears all state information, and
   returns into IDLE.

4.2.4. Forwarder management procedures

   The  management  of  an  intermediate  forwarder  is  slightly  more
   complex. When an ST peer receives a data response, it increments the
   local counter RespCounter, set to 0 at session state creation, and
   passes data response to the SA layer through the relevant APIs
   (loops on Active states in Figure 6 and Figure 7), by adding also
   the metric value towards the peer that has sent such a response,
   retrievable from the PeT. The SA, in turn, adds this data response
   to the stack prepared upon entering the Wait Response state, and
   increases its depth value (loops on Wait Responses state in Figure 4
   and Figure 5). When all waited responses have been received by the
   ST layer, which means that the number of responses and error message
   is equal to the number of sent queries, the ST comes back into the
   Forwarder state (Figure 7), by notifying the SA. The SA queries the
   local NFV instance, adds the relevant data to the stack with dept
   equal to 0, and triggers the ST to send all the data response stack
   upstream. Then, it clears all state variables and moves back into
   IDLE. In turn, the ST sends these data upstream, clears all state
   information, and moves back into IDLE. A similar behavior is
   followed when, at the SA layer, the WaitResp timer, started upon
   entering the Wait Responses state, expires. In this case, it
   triggers the delivery of received response data upstream, without
   waiting for the notification from the ST. In Figure 7, this
   corresponds to edges from Active states to IDLE.

   When either the desired responses are received or the wait time
   expires, the SA initiator moves again into the IDLE state, by
   sending the collected responses to the SF instance.

   Additional timers for managing situations in which either the SA, or
   the ST layer, crashes or freezes, can been added optionally.
   However, they are implementation dependent details, and thus out of
   the scope of this document.



4.2.5. SA messages

   In order to manage the SF states and discovery, three SA messages
   have been introduced, referred to as data in FSMs, illustrated in
   the ABNF format in Figure 10 below. The SETUP and REMOVE messages
   enable the SA instance to add or delete states, respectively, within
   the SF application. These messages can be acknowledged with a simple
   response code (e.g. 200 OK or Error code) by the SA forwarder,
   indicated as data response in FSMs. However, it is also possible to
   enable the overall FSM functioning without data response, by simply

   setting WaitResp=0 at the SA layer. The PROBE message is more
   interesting, since it allows collecting information on the status of
   a SF application and the relative position of the hosting nodes,
   represented as an overlay tree. In this case, the data on the NFV
   status are transported within data responses.

   The fields used in SA messages are:

   o Message Type: identifies the type of the message.

   o Service type: this flag has the following meaning: the value 0
      indicates that the signaling session does not require a Response
      message, the value 1 indicates that the signaling session must be
      acknowledged with a Response message.

   o Response code: identifies the response code of the NFV
        application.

   o SF Payload: optional SF opaque data

Internet-Draft   Off-Path Signaling Protocol for SFC        March 2015


   o Node-Identifier: this field identifies the node hosting the SF.
        It can be set with the main IP address of the node or with a
        unique identifier.

   o Status code: a code representing the status of the SF.

   o Depth: this field is interpreted as an integer value and has the
        following meaning. Each SA sets the depth field of its own
        status element to 0. The SF Status Elements are added
        recursively to a stack by each forwarder, as the responses
        were collected and sent upstream. As indicated in Figure 5,
        each SA forwarder increments by one the depth value of the
        Status Elements received by the downstream peer, and adds its
        own Status element to the stack only when all the expected
        responses have been collected (i.e., on the top of the stack).
        This syntax allows the initiator to parse the stack of the
        Status Element with the relevant depth field and to build a
        tree of the off-path domain with the following logic: the
        first element of the stack represents the root, with depth 0.
        For each element E in the stack with depth i, its father
        node is the first element of depth i-1, found parsing the list
        backward from E toward the root. Its children set is composed
        by each element C with depth i+1, found parsing the list from
        E toward the end until a node with depth k<=i is found.



5. Security Considerations

   Messages of OSP can be transported by any layer 4 protocol,
   including UDP and TCP. In case security is desired, TLS/SSL over TCP
   can be used.

   SFC and OSP must provide mechanisms for:

   o Rate control methods should be deployed to avoid DDOS attack with
      Gossip or Query messages.

   o Avoiding leakage of SFC information beyond its administrative
      domain.



6. IANA Considerations

   No action is required by IANA for this document.

7. Conclusions

   This document illustrates a new signaling protocol, called OSP, for
   discovering network resources and made them available to the SF
   framework. The original feature of this protocol is its off-path
   scope, which is enabled through gossip-based discovery and flooding-
   based distribution. Signaling distribution leverages on the protocol
   packet capture capability.
