Internet-Draft          H.263 RTP payload format           November 2005


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies an RTP payload header format applicable to
   the transmission of video streams generated based on the 1998 and
   2000 versions of ITU-T Recommendation H.263 [H263P].  Because the
   1998 and 2000 versions of H.263 are a superset of the 1996 syntax,
   this format can also be used with the 1996 version of H.263 [H263],
   and is recommended for this use by new implementations.  This format
   replaces the payload format in RFC 2190[RFC2190], which continues to
   be used by some existing implementations, and can be useful for
   backward compatibility.  New implementations supporting H.263 will
   use the payload format described in this document.

   The document updates the media type registration that was previously
   in RFC 3555.

   This document obsoletes RFC2429.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119[RFC2119] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant RTP implementations.

2.  New H.263 features

   The 1998 version of ITU-T Recommendation H.263 added numerous coding
   options to improve codec performance over the 1996 version.  The 1998
   version is referred to as H.263+ in this document.  The 2000 version
   is referred to as H.263++ in this document.

   Among the new options, the ones with the biggest impact on the RTP
   payload specification and the error resilience of the video content
   are the slice structured mode, the independent segment decoding mode,
   the reference picture selection mode, and the scalability mode.  This
   section summarizes the impact of these new coding options on
   packetization.  Refer to [H263P] for more information on coding
   options.

   The slice structured mode was added to H.263+ for three purposes: to
   provide enhanced error resilience capability, to make the bitstream
   more amenable to use with an underlying packet transport such as RTP,
   and to minimize video delay.  The slice structured mode supports
   fragmentation at macroblock boundaries.

   With the independent segment decoding (ISD) option, a video picture
   frame is broken into segments and encoded in such a way that each
   segment is independently decodable.  Utilizing ISD in a lossy network
   environment helps to prevent the propagation of errors from one
   segment of the picture to others.

   The reference picture selection mode allows the use of an older
   reference picture rather than the one immediately preceding the
   current picture.  Usually, the last transmitted frame is implicitly
   used as the reference picture for inter-frame prediction.  If the
   reference picture selection mode is used, the data stream carries
   information on what reference frame should be used, indicated by the
   temporal reference as an ID for that reference frame.  The reference
   picture selection mode may be used with or without a back channel,
   which provides information to the encoder about the internal status
   of the decoder.  However, no special provision is made herein for
   carrying back channel information.  The Extended RTP Profile for
   RTCP-based Feedback [AVPF] MAY be used as a back channel mechanism.

   H.263+ also includes bitstream scalability as an optional coding
   mode.  Three kinds of scalability are defined: temporal, signal-to-
   noise ratio (SNR), and spatial scalability.  Temporal scalability is
   achieved via the disposable nature of bi-directionally predicted
   frames, or B-frames.  (A low-delay form of temporal scalability known
   as P-picture temporal scalability can also be achieved by using the
   reference picture selection mode described in the previous
   paragraph.)  SNR scalability permits refinement of encoded video

   frames, thereby improving the quality (or SNR).  Spatial scalability
   is similar to SNR scalability except the refinement layer is twice
   the size of the base layer in the horizontal dimension, vertical
   dimension, or both.

3.  Usage of RTP

   When transmitting H.263+ video streams over the Internet, the output
   of the encoder can be packetized directly.  All the bits resulting
   from the bitstream including the fixed length codes and variable
   length codes will be included in the packet, with the only exception
   being that when the payload of a packet begins with a Picture, GOB,
   Slice, EOS, or EOSBS start code, the first two (all-zero) bytes of
   the start code shall be removed and replaced by setting an indicator
   bit in the payload header.

   For H.263+ bitstreams coded with temporal, spatial, or SNR
   scalability, each layer may be transported to a different network
   address.  More specifically, each layer may use a unique IP address
   and port number combination.  The temporal relations between layers
   shall be expressed using the RTP timestamp so that they can be
   synchronized at the receiving ends in multicast or unicast
   applications.

   The H.263+ video stream will be carried as payload data within RTP
   packets.  A new H.263+ payload header is defined in section 3.  This
   section defines the usage of the RTP fixed header and H.263+ video
   packet structure.

3.1.  RTP Header Usage

   Each RTP packet starts with a fixed RTP header.  The following fields
   of the RTP fixed header used for H.263+ video streams are further
   emphasized here:

   Marker bit (M bit): The Marker bit of the RTP header is set to 1 when
   the current packet carries the end of current frame, and is 0
   otherwise.

   Payload Type (PT): The RTP profile for a particular class of
   applications will assign a payload type for this encoding, or if that
   is not done, then a payload type in the dynamic range shall be chosen
   by the sender.

   Timestamp: The RTP Timestamp encodes the sampling instance of the
   first video frame data contained in the RTP data packet.  The RTP
   timestamp shall be the same on successive packets if a video frame
   occupies more than one packet.  In a multilayer scenario, all
   pictures corresponding to the same temporal reference should use the
   same timestamp.  If temporal scalability is used (if B-frames are
   present), the timestamp may not be monotonically increasing in the
   RTP stream.  If B-frames are transmitted on a separate layer and
   address, they must be synchronized properly with the reference

   frames.  Refer to the 1998 ITU-T Recommendation H.263 [H263P] for
   information on required transmission order to a decoder.  For an
   H.263+ video stream, the RTP timestamp is based on a 90 kHz clock,
   the same as that of the RTP payload for H.261 stream [RFC2032].
   Since both the H.263+ data and the RTP header contain time
   information, those timing information must run synchronously.  That
   is, both the RTP timestamp and the temporal reference (TR in the
   picture header of H.263) should carry the same relative timing
   information.  Any H.263+ picture clock frequency can be expressed as
   1800000/(cd*cf) source pictures per second, in which cd is an integer
   from 1 to 127 and cf is either 1000 or 1001.  Using the 90 kHz clock
   of the RTP timestamp, the time increment between each coded H.263+
   picture should therefore be a integer multiple of (cd*cf)/20.  This
   will always be an integer for any "reasonable" picture clock
   frequency (for example, it is 3003 for 29.97 Hz NTSC, 3600 for 25 Hz
   PAL, 3750 for 24 Hz film, and 1500, 1250 and 1200 for the computer
   display update rates of 60, 72 and 75 Hz, respectively).  For RTP
   packetization of hypothetical H.263+ bitstreams using "unreasonable"
   custom picture clock frequencies, mathematical rounding could become
   necessary for generating the RTP timestamps.

3.2.  Video Packet Structure

   A section of an H.263+ compressed bitstream is carried as a payload
   within each RTP packet.  For each RTP packet, the RTP header is
   followed by an H.263+ payload header, which is followed by a number
   of bytes of a standard H.263+ compressed bitstream.  The size of the
   H.263+ payload header is variable depending on the payload involved
   as detailed in the section 4.  The layout of the RTP H.263+ video
   packet is shown as:


         0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |    RTP Header
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

       |    H.263+ Compressed Data Stream
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Any H.263+ start codes can be byte aligned by an encoder by using the
   stuffing mechanisms of H.263+.  As specified in H.263+, picture,
   slice, and EOSBS starts codes shall always be byte aligned, and GOB
   and EOS start codes may be byte aligned.  For packetization purposes,
   GOB start codes should be byte aligned; however, since this is not
   required in H.263+, there may be some cases where GOB start codes are



Ott, et al.                Expires May 5, 2006                  [Page 7]

   not aligned, such as when transmitting existing content, or when
   using H.263 encoders that do not support GOB start code alignment.
   In this case, follow-on packets (see section 5.2) should be used for
   packetization.

   All H.263+ start codes (Picture, GOB, Slice, EOS, and EOSBS) begin
   with 16 zero-valued bits.  If a start code is byte aligned and it
   occurs at the beginning of a packet, these two bytes shall be removed
   from the H.263+ compressed data stream in the packetization process
   and shall instead be represented by setting a bit (the P bit) in the
   payload header.

4.  Design Considerations

   The goals of this payload format are to specify an efficient way of
   encapsulating an H.263+ standard compliant bitstream and to enhance
   the resiliency towards packet losses.  Due to the large number of
   different possible coding schemes in H.263+, a copy of the picture
   header with configuration information is inserted into the payload
   header when appropriate.  The use of that copy of the picture header
   along with the payload data can allow decoding of a received packet
   even in such cases in which another packet containing the original
   picture header becomes lost.

   There are a few assumptions and constraints associated with this
   H.263+ payload header design.  The purpose of this section is to
   point out various design issues and also to discuss several coding
   options provided by H.263+ that may impact the performance of
   network-based H.263+ video.

   o  The optional slice structured mode described in Annex K of H.263+
      [H263P] enables more flexibility for packetization.  Similar to a
      picture segment that begins with a GOB header, the motion vector
      predictors in a slice are restricted to reside within its
      boundaries.  However, slices provide much greater freedom in the
      selection of the size and shape of the area which is represented
      as a distinct decodable region.  In particular, slices can have a
      size which is dynamically selected to allow the data for each
      slice to fit into a chosen packet size.  Slices can also be chosen
      to have a rectangular shape which is conducive for minimizing the
      impact of errors and packet losses on motion compensated
      prediction.  For these reasons, the use of the slice structured
      mode is strongly recommended for any applications used in
      environments where significant packet loss occurs.

   o  In non-rectangular slice structured mode, only complete slices
      should be included in a packet.  In other words, slices should not
      be fragmented across packet boundaries.  The only reasonable need
      for a slice to be fragmented across packet boundaries is when the
      encoder which generated the H.263+ data stream could not be
      influenced by an awareness of the packetization process (such as
      when sending H.263+ data through a network other than the one to
      which the encoder is attached, as in network gateway
      implementations).  Optimally, each packet will contain only one
      slice.

   o  The independent segment decoding (ISD) described in Annex R of
      [H263P] prevents any data dependency across slice or GOB
      boundaries in the reference picture.  It can be utilized to
      further improve resiliency in high loss conditions.

Internet-Draft          H.263 RTP payload format           November 2005


   o  If ISD is used in conjunction with the slice structure, the
      rectangular slice submode shall be enabled and the dimensions and
      quantity of the slices present in a frame shall remain the same
      between each two intra-coded frames (I-frames), as required in
      H.263+.  The individual ISD segments may also be entirely intra
      coded from time to time to realize quick error recovery without
      adding the latency time associated with sending complete INTRA-
      pictures.

   o  When the slice structure is not applied, the insertion of a
      (preferably byte-aligned) GOB header can be used to provide resync
      boundaries in the bitstream, as the presence of a GOB header
      eliminates the dependency of motion vector prediction across GOB
      boundaries.  These resync boundaries provide natural locations for
      packet payload boundaries.

   o  H.263+ allows picture headers to be sent in an abbreviated form in
      order to prevent repetition of overhead information that does not
      change from picture to picture.  For resiliency, sending a
      complete picture header for every frame is often advisable.  This
      means that (especially in cases with high packet loss probability
      in which picture header contents are not expected to be highly
      predictable), the sender may find it advisable to always set the
      subfield UFEP in PLUSPTYPE to '001' in the H.263+ video bitstream.
      (See [H263P] for the definition of the UFEP and PLUSPTYPE fields).

   o  In a multi-layer scenario, each layer may be transmitted to a
      different network address.  The configuration of each layer such
      as the enhancement layer number (ELNUM), reference layer number
      (RLNUM), and scalability type should be determined at the start of
      the session and should not change during the course of the
      session.

   o  All start codes can be byte aligned, and picture, slice, and EOSBS
      start codes are always byte aligned.  The boundaries of these
      syntactical elements provide ideal locations for placing packet
      boundaries.

   o  We assume that a maximum Picture Header size of 504 bits is
      sufficient.  The syntax of H.263+ does not explicitly prohibit
      larger picture header sizes, but the use of such extremely large
      picture headers is not expected.

5.  H.263+ Payload Header

   For H.263+ video streams, each RTP packet shall carry only one H.263+
   video packet.  The H.263+ payload header shall always be present for
   each H.263+ video packet.  The payload header is of variable length.
   A 16 bit field of the basic payload header may be followed by an 8
   bit field for Video Redundancy Coding (VRC) information, and/or by a
   variable length extra picture header as indicated by PLEN.  These
   optional fields appear in the order given above when present.

   If an extra picture header is included in the payload header, the
   length of the picture header in number of bytes is specified by PLEN.
   The minimum length of the payload header is 16 bits, corresponding to
   PLEN equal to 0 and no VRC information present.

   The remainder of this section defines the various components of the
   RTP payload header.  Section six defines the various packet types
   that are used to carry different types of H.263+ coded data, and
   section seven summarizes how to distinguish between the various
   packet types.

5.1.  General H.263+ payload header

   The H.263+ payload header is structured as follows:


      0                   1
         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        |   RR    |P|V|   PLEN    |PEBIT|
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   RR: 5 bits

      Reserved bits.  SHALL be zero.  MUST be ignored by receivers

   P: 1 bit

      Indicates the picture start or a picture segment (GOB/Slice) start
      or a video sequence end (EOS or EOSBS).  Two bytes of zero bits
      then have to be prefixed to the payload of such a packet to
      compose a complete picture/GOB/slice/EOS/EOSBS start code.  This
      bit allows the omission of the two first bytes of the start codes,
      thus improving the compression ratio.

   V: 1 bit

Internet-Draft          H.263 RTP payload format           November 2005


      Indicates the presence of an 8 bit field containing information
      for Video Redundancy Coding (VRC), which follows immediately after
      the initial 16 bits of the payload header if present.  For syntax
      and semantics of that 8 bit VRC field see section 5.2.

   PLEN: 6 bits

      Length in bytes of the extra picture header.  If no extra picture
      header is attached, PLEN is 0.  If PLEN>0, the extra picture
      header is attached immediately following the rest of the payload
      header.  Note the length reflects the omission of the first two
      bytes of the picture start code (PSC).  See section 6.1.

   PEBIT: 3 bits

      Indicates the number of bits that shall be ignored in the last
      byte of the picture header.  If PLEN is not zero, the ignored bits
      shall be the least significant bits of the byte.  If PLEN is zero,
      then PEBIT shall also be zero.

5.2.  Video Redundancy Coding Header Extension

   Video Redundancy Coding (VRC) is an optional mechanism intended to
   improve error resilience over packet networks.  Implementing VRC in
   H.263+ will require the Reference Picture Selection option described
   in Annex N of [H263P].  By having multiple "threads" of independently
   inter-frame predicted pictures, damage of individual frame will cause
   distortions only within its own thread but leave the other threads
   unaffected.  From time to time, all threads converge to a so-called
   sync frame (an INTRA picture or a non-INTRA picture which is
   redundantly represented within multiple threads); from this sync
   frame, the independent threads are started again.  For more
   information on codec support for VRC see [Vredun].

   P-picture temporal scalability is another use of the reference
   picture selection mode and can be considered a special case of VRC in
   which only one copy of each sync frame may be sent.  It offers a
   thread-based method of temporal scalability without the increased
   delay caused by the use of B pictures.  In this use, sync frames sent
   in the first thread of pictures are also used for the prediction of a
   second thread of pictures which fall temporally between the sync
   frames to increase the resulting frame rate.  In this use, the
   pictures in the second thread can be discarded in order to obtain a
   reduction of bit rate or decoding complexity without harming the
   ability to decode later pictures.  A third or more threads can also
   be added as well, but each thread is predicted only from the sync
   frames (which are sent at least in thread 0) or from frames within
   the same thread.

   While a VRC data stream is - like all H.263+ data - totally self-
   contained, it may be useful for the transport hierarchy
   implementation to have knowledge about the current damage status of
   each thread.  On the Internet, this status can easily be determined
   by observing the marker bit, the sequence number of the RTP header,
   and the thread-id and a circling "packet per thread" number.  The
   latter two numbers are coded in the VRC header extension.

   The format of the VRC header extension is as follows:

             0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        | TID | Trun  |S|
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   TID: 3 bits

   Thread ID.  Up to 7 threads are allowed.  Each frame of H.263+ VRC
   data will use as reference information only sync frames or frames
   within the same thread.  By convention, thread 0 is expected to be
   the "canonical" thread, which is the thread from which the sync frame
   should ideally be used.  In the case of corruption or loss of the
   thread 0 representation, a representation of the sync frame with a
   higher thread number can be used by the decoder.  Lower thread
   numbers are expected to contain equal or better representations of
   the sync frames than higher thread numbers in the absence of data
   corruption or loss.  See [Vredun] for a detailed discussion of VRC.

   Trun: 4 bits

   Monotonically increasing (modulo 16) 4 bit number counting the packet
   number within each thread.

   S: 1 bit

   A bit that indicates that the packet content is for a sync frame.  An
   encoder using VRC may send several representations of the same "sync"
   picture, in order to ensure that regardless of which thread of
   pictures is corrupted by errors or packet losses, the reception of at
   least one representation of a particular picture is ensured (within
   at least one thread).  The sync picture can then be used for the
   prediction of any thread.  If packet losses have not occurred, then
   the sync frame contents of thread 0 can be used and those of other
   threads can be discarded (and similarly for other threads).  Thread 0
   is considered the "canonical" thread, the use of which is preferable
   to all others.  The contents of packets having lower thread numbers
   shall be considered as having a higher processing and delivery
   priority than those with higher thread numbers.  Thus packets having

   lower thread numbers for a given sync frame shall be delivered first
   to the decoder under loss-free and low-time-jitter conditions, which
   will result in the discarding of the sync contents of the higher-
   numbered threads as specified in Annex N of [H263P].

6.  Packetization schemes

6.1.  Picture Segment Packets and Sequence Ending Packets (P=1)

   A picture segment packet is defined as a packet that starts at the
   location of a Picture, GOB, or slice start code in the H.263+ data
   stream.  This corresponds to the definition of the start of a video
   picture segment as defined in H.263+.  For such packets, P=1 always.

   An extra picture header can sometimes be attached in the payload
   header of such packets.  Whenever an extra picture header is attached
   as signified by PLEN>0, only the last six bits of its picture start
   code, '100000', are included in the payload header.  A complete
   H.263+ picture header with byte aligned picture start code can be
   conveniently assembled on the receiving end by prepending the sixteen
   leading '0' bits.

   When PLEN>0, the end bit position corresponding to the last byte of
   the picture header data is indicated by PEBIT.  The actual bitstream
   data shall begin on an 8-bit byte boundary following the payload
   header.

   A sequence ending packet is defined as a packet that starts at the
   location of an EOS or EOSBS code in the H.263+ data stream.  This
   delineates the end of a sequence of H.263+ video data (more H.263+
   video data may still follow later, however, as specified in ITU-T
   Recommendation H.263).  For such packets, P=1 and PLEN=0 always.

   The optional header extension for VRC may or may not be present as
   indicated by the V bit flag.

6.1.1.  Packets that begin with a Picture Start Code

   Any packet that contains the whole or the start of a coded picture
   shall start at the location of the picture start code (PSC), and
   should normally be encapsulated with no extra copy of the picture
   header.  In other words, normally PLEN=0 in such a case.  However, if
   the coded picture contains an incomplete picture header (UFEP =
   "000"), then a representation of the complete (UFEP = "001") picture
   header may be attached during packetization in order to provide
   greater error resilience.  Thus, for packets that start at the
   location of a picture start code, PLEN shall be zero unless both of
   the following conditions apply:

   1) The picture header in the H.263+ bitstream payload is incomplete
   (PLUSPTYPE present and UFEP="000"), and

   2) The additional picture header which is attached is not incomplete



Ott, et al.                Expires May 5, 2006                 [Page 15]

Internet-Draft          H.263 RTP payload format           November 2005


   (UFEP="001").

   A packet which begins at the location of a Picture, GOB, slice, EOS,
   or EOSBS start code shall omit the first two (all zero) bytes from
   the H.263+ bitstream, and signify their presence by setting P=1 in
   the payload header.

   Here is an example of encapsulating the first packet in a frame
   (without an attached redundant complete picture header):

    0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |   RR    |1|V|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0| bitstream data without the    |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     | first two 0 bytes of the PSC
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

6.1.2.  Packets that begin with GBSC or SSC

   For a packet that begins at the location of a GOB or slice start
   code, PLEN may be zero or may be nonzero, depending on whether a
   redundant picture header is attached to the packet.  In environments
   with very low packet loss rates, or when picture header contents are
   very seldom likely to change (except as can be detected from the GFID
   syntax of H.263+), a redundant copy of the picture header is not
   required.  However, in less ideal circumstances a redundant picture
   header should be attached for enhanced error resilience, and its
   presence is indicated by PLEN>0.

   Assuming a PLEN of 9 and P=1, below is an example of a packet that
   begins with a byte aligned GBSC or a SSC:

         0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |   RR    |1|V|0 0 1 0 0 1|PEBIT|1 0 0 0 0 0| picture header    |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       | starting with TR, PTYPE ...                                   |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       | ...                                           | bitstream     |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       | data starting with GBSC/SSC without its first two 0 bytes
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Notice that only the last six bits of the picture start code,
   '100000', are included in the payload header.  A complete H.263+
   picture header with byte aligned picture start code can be

Internet-Draft          H.263 RTP payload format           November 2005


   conveniently assembled if needed on the receiving end by prepending
   the sixteen leading '0' bits.

6.1.3.  Packets that Begin with an EOS or EOSBS Code

   For a packet that begins with an EOS or EOSBS code, PLEN shall be
   zero, and no Picture, GOB, or Slice start codes shall be included
   within the same packet.  As with other packets beginning with start
   codes, the two all-zero bytes that begin the EOS or EOSBS code at the
   beginning of the packet shall be omitted, and their presence shall be
   indicated by setting the P bit to 1 in the payload header.

   System designers should be aware that some decoders may interpret the
   loss of a packet containing only EOS or EOSBS information as the loss
   of essential video data and may thus respond by not displaying some
   subsequent video information.  Since EOS and EOSBS codes do not
   actually affect the decoding of video pictures, they are somewhat
   unnecessary to send at all.  Because of the danger of
   misinterpretation of the loss of such a packet (which can be detected
   by the sequence number), encoders are generally to be discouraged
   from sending EOS and EOSBS.

   Below is an example of a packet containing an EOS code:

              0                   1                   2
         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        |   RR    |1|V|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|1|1|1|1|0|0|
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

6.2.  Encapsulating Follow-On Packet (P=0)

   A Follow-on packet contains a number of bytes of coded H.263+ data
   which does not start at a synchronization point.  That is, a
   Follow-On packet does not start with a Picture, GOB, Slice, EOS, or
   EOSBS header, and it may or may not start at a macroblock boundary.
   Since Follow-on packets do not start at synchronization points, the
   data at the beginning of a follow-on packet is not independently
   decodable.  For such packets, P=0 always.  If the preceding packet of
   a Follow-on packet got lost, the receiver may discard that Follow-on
   packet as well as all other following Follow-on packets.  Better
   behavior, of course, would be for the receiver to scan the interior
   of the packet payload content to determine whether any start codes
   are found in the interior of the packet which can be used as resync
   points.  The use of an attached copy of a picture header for a
   follow-on packet is useful only if the interior of the packet or some
   subsequent follow-on packet contains a resync code such as a GOB or
   slice start code.  PLEN>0 is allowed, since it may allow resync in

   the interior of the packet.  The decoder may also be resynchronized
   at the next segment or picture packet.

   Here is an example of a follow-on packet (with PLEN=0):

         0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

7.  Use of this payload specification

   There is no syntactical difference between a picture segment packet
   and a Follow-on packet, other than the indication P=1 for picture
   segment or sequence ending packets and P=0 for Follow-on packets.
   See the following for a summary of the entire packet types and ways
   to distinguish between them.

   It is possible to distinguish between the different packet types by
   checking the P bit and the first 6 bits of the payload along with the
   header information.  The following table shows the packet type for
   permutations of this information (see also the picture/GOB/Slice
   header descriptions in H.263+ for details):

    -------------+--------------+----------------------+----------------
   First 6 bits | P-Bit | PLEN |  Packet              |  Remarks
   of Payload   |(payload hdr.)|                      |
   -------------+--------------+----------------------+----------------
   100000       |   1   |  0   |  Picture             | Typical Picture
   100000       |   1   | > 0  |  Picture             | Note UFEP
   1xxxxx       |   1   |  0   |  GOB/Slice/EOS/EOSBS | See possible GNs
   1xxxxx       |   1   | > 0  |  GOB/Slice           | See possible GNs
   Xxxxxx       |   0   |  0   |  Follow-on           |
   Xxxxxx       |   0   | > 0  |  Follow-on           | Interior Resync
   -------------+--------------+----------------------+----------------

   The details regarding the possible values of the five bit Group
   Number (GN) field which follows the initial "1" bit when the P-bit is
   "1" for a GOB, Slice, EOS, or EOSBS packet are found in section 5.2.3
   of H.263[H263P].

   As defined in this specification, every start of a coded frame (as
   indicated by the presence of a PSC) has to be encapsulated as a
   picture segment packet.  If the whole coded picture fits into one
   packet of reasonable size (which is dependent on the connection
   characteristics), this is the only type of packet that may need to be
   used.  Due to the high compression ratio achieved by H.263+ it is
   often possible to use this mechanism, especially for small spatial
   picture formats such as QCIF and typical Internet packet sizes around
   1500 bytes.

   If the complete coded frame does not fit into a single packet, two
   different ways for the packetization may be chosen.  In case of very
   low or zero packet loss probability, one or more Follow-on packets
   may be used for coding the rest of the picture.  Doing so leads to
   minimal coding and packetization overhead as well as to an optimal
   use of the maximal packet size, but does not provide any added error
   resilience.

   The alternative is to break the picture into reasonably small
   partitions - called Segments - (by using the Slice or GOB mechanism),
   that do offer synchronization points.  By doing so and using the
   Picture Segment payload with PLEN>0, decoding of the transmitted
   packets is possible even in such cases in which the Picture packet
   containing the picture header was lost (provided any necessary
   reference picture is available).  Picture Segment packets can also be
   used in conjunction with Follow-on packets for large segment sizes.

      "N" - Reference Picture Selection mode - Four numeric choices
      (1-4) are available representing the following modes:

      1: NEITHER: In which no back-channel data is returned from the
      decoder to the encoder.

      2: ACK: In which the decoder returns only acknowledgment messages.

      3: NACK: In which the decoder returns only non-acknowledgment
      messages

      4: ACK+NACK: In which the decoder returns both acknowledgment and
      non-acknowledgment messages.



      No special provision is made herein for carrying back channel
      information.  The Extended RTP Profile for RTCP-based Feedback
      [AVPF] MAY be used as a back channel mechanism.



      "P" - Reference Picture Resampling with the following submodes
      represented as a number fro 1 to 4:

      1: dynamicPictureResizingByFour

      2: dynamicPictureResizingBySixteenthPel

      3: dynamicWarpingHalfPel

      4: dynamicWarpingSixteenthPel

      Example: P=1,3



      PAR - Arbitrary Pixel Aspect Ratio : defines the width:height
      ratio by two colon separated integers between 0 and 255.  Default
      ratio is 12:11 if not otherwise specified.

      CPCF - Arbitrary (Custom) Picture Clock Frequency: CPCF is a
      floating point value.  Default value is 29.97 Hz.

      BPP - BitsPerPictureMaxKb: Maximum number of bits in units of 1024
      bits allowed to represent a single picture.  If this parameter is
      not present, then the default value, based on the maximum
      supported resolution, is used.  BPP is integer value between 0 and

   Interoperability considerations:

      These are receiver options, current implementations will not send
      any optional parameters in their SDP.  They will ignore the
      optional parameters and will encode the H.263 stream without any
      of the annexes.  Most decoders support at least QCIF and CIF fixed
      resolutions and they are expected to be available almost in every
      H.263 based video application.

8.1.2.  Registration of MIME media type video/H263-2000

   MIME media type name: video

   MIME subtype name: H263-2000

   Required parameters: None

   Optional parameters:

      The optional parameters of the H263-1998 type MAY be used with
      this MIME subtype.  Specific optional parameters that may be used
      with the H263-2000 type are:

      PROFILE: H.263 profile number, in the range 0 through 10,
      specifying the supported H.263 annexes/subparts based on H.263
      annex X[H263X].  The annexes supported in each profile are listed
      in table X.1 of H.263 annex X.  If no profile or H.263 annex is
      specified than the stream is Baseline H.263 (profile 0 of H.263
      annex X).

      LEVEL: Level of bitstream operation, in the range 0 through 100,
      specifying the level of computational complexity of the decoding
      process.  The level are described in table X.2 of H.263 annex X.

      According to H.263 annex X, support of any level other than level
      45 implies support of all lower levels.  Support of level 45
      implies support of level 10

      A system that specifies support of a PROFILE MUST specify the
      supported LEVEL.

      INTERLACE: Interlaced or 60 fields indicates the support for
      interlace display mode.  This parameter if supported SHALL have
      the values "1".  If not supported it should not be listed or SHALL
      have the value "0"

8.2.  SDP Parameters

   The media types video/H263-1998 and video/H263-2000 are mapped to
   fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) as follows:

   o The media name in the "m=" line of SDP MUST be video.

   o The encoding name in the "a=rtpmap" line of SDP MUST be H263-1998
   or H263-2000 (the MIME subtype).

   o The clock rate in the "a=rtpmap" line MUST be 90000.

   o The optional parameters if any, MUST be included in the "a=fmtp"
   line of SDP.  These parameters are expressed as a media type string,
   in the form of a semicolon separated list of parameter=value pairs.
   The optional parameters PROFILE and LEVEL SHALL NOT be used with any
   of the other optional parameters.

8.2.1.  Usage with the SDP Offer Answer Model

   When offering H.263 over RTP using SDP in an Offer/Answer
   model[RFC3264] the following considerations are necessary.

   Codec options: (F,I,J,K,N,P,T) These options MUST NOT appear unless
   the sender of these SDP parameters is able to decode those options.
   These options are receiver's capability even when send in a
   "sendonly" offer.

   Profile: The offer of a SDP profile parameter signal that the sender
   can decode a stream that uses the specified profile.  Each profile
   uses different H.263 annexes so there is no implied relationship
   between them.  In the offer/answer exchange this parameter SHOULD be
   the same in the offer and answer.  A decoder that support a profile
   SHALL also support H.263 baseline profile (profile 0).

   Picture sizes and MPI:

   Supported picture sizes and their corresponding minimum picture
   interval (MPI) information for H.263 can be combined.  All picture
   sizes can be advertised to the other party, or only a subset of it.
   Terminal announces only those picture sizes (with their MPIs) which
   it is willing to receive.  For example, MPI=2 means that maximum
   (decodable) picture rate per second is about 15.

   If the receiver does not specify the picture size /MPI optional
   parameter then it SHOULD be ready to receive QCIF resolution with
   MPI=1.

   Parameters offered first are the most preferred picture mode to be
   received.

   Example of the usage of these parameters:

   CIF=4;QCIF=3;SQCIF=2;CUSTOM=360,240,2

   This means that encoder SHOULD send CIF picture size, which it can
   decode at MPI=4.  If that is not possible, then QCIF with MPI value
   3, if neither are possible, then SQCIF with MPI value=2.  The
   receiver is able of (but least preferred) decoding custom picture
   sizes (max 360x240) with MPI=2.  Note that most decoders support at
   least QCIF and CIF fixed resolutions and they are expected to be
   available almost in every H.263 based video application.

   Below is an example of H.263 SDP in an offer.

   a=fmtp:xx CIF=4;QCIF=2;F=1;K=1

   This means that the sender of this message can decode H.263 bit
   stream with following options and parameters: Preferred resolution is
   CIF (its MPI is 4), but if that is not possible then QCIF size is ok.
   AP and slicesInOrder-NonRect options MAY be used.

9.  Backward Compatibility to RFC2429

   The current draft updates RFC2429.  This section will address the
   backward compatibility issues.

9.1.  New SDP optional parameters

   The draft adds new optional parameters to the H263-1998 and H263-2000
   payload type.  Since these are optional parameters we expect old
   implementation to ignore these parameters while new implementations
   that will receive the H263-1998 and H263-2000 payload type with no
   parameters will behave as if the other side can accept H.263 at QCIF
   resolution and 30 frames per second.

10.  Security Considerations

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification [RFC3550], and any appropriate RTP profile (for example
   [RFC3551]).  This implies that confidentiality of the media streams
   is achieved by encryption.  Because the data compression used with
   this payload format is applied end-to-end, encryption may be
   performed after compression so there is no conflict between the two
   operations.

   A potential denial-of-service threat exists for data encoding using
   compression techniques that have non-uniform receiver-end
   computational load.  The attacker can inject pathological datagrams
   into the stream which are complex to decode and cause the receiver to
   be overloaded.  The usage of authentication of at least the RTP
   packet is RECOMMENDED

   As with any IP-based protocol, in some circumstances a receiver may
   be overloaded simply by the receipt of too many packets, either
   desired or undesired.  Network-layer authentication may be used to
   discard packets from undesired sources, but the processing cost of
   the authentication itself may be too high.  In a multicast
   environment, pruning of specific sources may be implemented in future
   versions of IGMP [RFC2032] and in multicast routing protocols to
   allow a receiver to select which sources are allowed to reach it.

   A security review of this payload format found no additional
   considerations beyond those in the RTP specification.

12.1.  changes from RFC 2429

   The changes from the RFC 2429 are:

   1.  The H.263 1998 and 2000 MIME type are now in the payload
   specification.

   2.  Added optional parameters to the H.263 1998 and 2000 MIME types

   3.  Mandate the usage of RFC2429 for all H.263.  RFC2190 payload
   format should be used only to interact with legacy systems.
