Abstract

  This Draft is to introduce Native Language Internet Address Service
  that becomes popular as an alternative Internet Name Service. 
  Especially, it describes the backgrounds, rationale and the 
  specification of the Native Language Internet Address Service.

  Generally in internet service when user types a word to connect to 
  the sepecific website, a quey typed in is so called as Keyword.
  However, keyword is a word used to descibe the service, which is to 
  type a word related to the information the user wants to get in the 
  serach engine. So the author, myself, would like to use  Native 
  Language Internet Address instead of Keyword.

1. Overview


  As Internet service and the Internet infrastructure grow very fast, 
  Internet Name Service that is a basis for the Internet service is also
  being developed rapidly. All the development is being carried out to
  give more convenience to the Internet users and these efforts are 
  shown in many ways.


  IP address and DNS(Domain Name System) are the general Internet
  addressing schemes from the start of the Internet era to nowadays.
  In case of DNS service, it is being extended to IDN for the 
  convenience of end users. In addition to these traditional addressing
  schemes, a new approach, called Native Language Internet Address, is 
  actively being discussed among in the Internet society.


  This document surveys the development trend of Internet Addressing
  schemes and describes the rationale and the architecture of Native 
  Language Internet Address Service as an alternative Internet 
  Addressing schemes.




2. Introduction


  2.1 Development of Internet Address



  Internet Address, as of today, has been advanced to allow multilingual
  characters in the domain names using IDN. However, from the viewpoint
  of the end user convenience, IDN is not an ultimate destination of the
  Internet Address development, but it is just one of the experimental
  tries to go beyond new Internet Address. 
  Among many Internet addresses, this document discusses the Native 
  Language Internet Address Service that has been discussed in a few 
  drafts.

  The development stages of Internet Addresses are as follows:
  
  1) IP Address				(210.103.175.31)
  2) Domain Name                	(netpia.com)
  3) I18N Domain Name           	(þœÌÌ¾Ë.com)
  4) Full I18N Domain Name      	(þœÌÌ¾Ë.®¹©‡.ÌÒ˜ , þœÌÌ¾Ë.®¹©‡)
  5) Native Language Internet Address  	(þœÌÌ¾Ë, Netpia)

Internet-Draft                      NLIAS                  November 2001

  As the number of IP address which is a combination of numbers has
  increased, the server management with only host IP addresses and host
  names becomes more inconvenient. To resolve this problem, domain name
  has emerged. Domain name, however, also has problems of limited 
  namespaces using LDH[1] only. As Internet has been spread to 
  non-English speaking countries, the need for using their own languages
  as Internet Addresses has increased. 
  
  As a result, IDN has emerged but it neither provide the community with
  the full convenience, nor is fully serviced as well. Now, more 
  convenient addresses, known as, Native Language Internet Address has 
  emerged. From 1) to 4) of above, the technical advancement has been 
  achieved through the need of community. Native Language Internet 
  Address, 5), is, conceptually, a brand new Internet address requires
  legal support as well as the technical advancement and community's 
  need.

  Native Language Internet Address is based on the assumption that it is
  better to recognize an Internet address without current Internet 
  addressing  hierarchies such as TLD and 2LD, and this is a more 
  advanced Internet addressing schemes.

  A legal background of Native Language Internet Address is as follows.

    þœÌÌ¾Ë.co.kr 
            | |
            | +-----> Hangul character itself can express  the ccTLD.
            |         That is a character code corresponds to .kr.
            +-------> It identifies the characteristic of organizations 
                      according to the traditional trademark principles.
                      Therefore, 2LD becomes unnecessary.


  The character sets or languages can be used as ccTLD or TLD by 
  character set identification system. For example, Hangul character set
  itself becomes ccTLD. This means that the language itself can identify
  the country so .kr is not needed any more and can be omitted. 
  Also, the traditional trademarks already imply the organizations. 
  So the `.co', which implies company or corporation, can be omitted. 
 
  For example, in "­¡À»ÈÈ©.go.kr", the Native Language Internet Address 
  "­¡À»ÈÈ©" (City Council of Seoul), itself identifies the governmental
  organization. As an another example, in "­¡À³‹ÌÏ˜þ.edu", the Native
  Language Internet Address, since "­¡À³‹ÌÏ˜þ" (The Seoul National 
  University) itself implies the educational institution ,".edu" is 
  notnecessary. 
  
  That is, 2LD or TLD such as ".co", ".go", ".or" or ".edu", which
  identify the characteristic of organizations already according to
  the traditional trademark principles, so it can be omitted in the
  domain names.
  
PJ LEE & CH BAE                                                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                      NLIAS                  November 2001

  In other words, ccTLD and TLD can be resolved by the character set 
  identification system. By the traditional trademark principles, the
  trademark name itself identifies 2LD and the organization, 
  for example, .co, .go, .or and etc. As technology advances, the system
  can identify the 2LD or TLD(ccTLD) from the name even if the user does
  not specifies it. It is a kind of more advanced system so that the 
  users can use the internet more conveniently.

  There are two more important advantages in this approach. 
  First, from the user's point, the availability of internet is one 
  factor to consider. In the traditional domain system, the domain is
  the combination of English alphabets and numbers designed for 
  universal use. However, this can be an obstacle to the Internet access
  for the non-English speaking people. But the Native Language Internet 
  Address can identifiy the Internet Address by the very real name in 
  the native language or notation, which make the Internet more 
  available to the local, non-Enlgish speaking people. Second, the 
  stability and the user friendliness of the system without using 2LD or
  TLD are another advantage of the system, which has been verified by
  the commercial service experience of the last 2 years.

  In the traditional domain names, as the combination of English 
  alphabets, in an abbreviated form, are used for the name, the 
  organization identification is needed to reduce the conflict of the 
  names. In Native Language Internet Address, a real trademark or a name
  is used in itself. The conflict can be minimized by using the real 
  name, although the registration policy permits abbreviated name by 
  warning the possible conflict. (legal issues)

  Native Language Internet Address has emerged as a result of Internet 
  Address development toward the convenience of the community and it 
  made the Internet more accessible for the community by using the real
  names in its native language, which was not possible in the 
  traditional Internet Addressing scheme. As mentioned above, Native 
  Language Internet Address is an advanced method derived from the 
  community needs and the technical and legal developments 
  of traditional internet addresses.



  2.2 Overview of Native Language Internet Address Service

  Native Language Internet Address Service connects the traditional 
  domain name to the unique information such as organizational name,
  trademark, service name, person's name, telephone number, HAM or 
  pager number, barcode and so on. Native Language Internet Address
  should be serviced in a regional legal boundary. Also, Native Language
  Internet Address is provided by user's locale information to map that
  information with the address of the cyber world.

Internet-Draft                      NLIAS                  November 2001

  2.3 Characteristics

  Since the characteristics of Native Language Internet Address can 
  express all the unique aspects of a given name, it should include all
  unique identifiers that a user can understand. Because Native Language
  Internet Address Service respects the registered names and can extend
  the implied name space easily, the name space shortage problem can be
  relatively alleviated. 
  
  Although it fails to satisfy all the needs of Internet Address as any
  other method, it enhances the accessibility and convenience of the end
  user, especially in non-English speaking regions.


3. Current Native Language Internet Address Service 

  Until now, four different attempts have been tried to provide the 
  Native Language Internet Address Service. 
  
  The following requirements should be satisfied for the future of 
  Internet and its community.

  1) user friendliness
  2) consistency
  3) extensibility
  4) stability
  5) recognizability
  6) universal validity

  Service methods are as follows:

  1) by application
  2) by OS support
  3) by network device
  4) by N/S extension

  One of the service methods is to provide Native Language Internet 
  Address Service by every application. This method is simple and easy
  method to do service, but each implementation may be responded with
  different answers. This causes a lot of confusions to the community
  who uses Native Language Internet Address as Internet Address, that 
  is, it lacks the uniformity. This makes the Internet as a closed 
  private service like most of the local communication service provides,
  which is not the goal of Internet service.

  Another try is to enhance the OS resolver or to use special
  networkdevices to provide the Native Language Internet Address Service
  But these methods are still in the experimental stage and lots of time
  and efforts are needed to apply these methods to the community. 
  For now, these lack the extensibility and the universal validity.

Internet-Draft                      NLIAS                  November 2001

  Yet another method that uses the NS query is being tried in many ways.
  This method is based on the fact that, in many applications, the
  Native Language Internet Address typed in (though sometimes this is 
  not the case) by the end user is transferred to the NS. In fact, there
  are various attempts to extend the name server. These alternative NS
  or extended NS can actively respond to the queries from various
  applications. 
  
  This method has advantages that it can provide the same response from
  different applications, which means that this can provide the 
  uniqueness of the Internet Address.

  Even though DNS was not made to provide the Native Language Internet
  Address Service, it gives a hint on what should be done to provide the
  Native Language Internet Address Service. Naming Service should 
  provide an unique service for the various applications. Native 
  Language Internet Address Service falls on these category. That means
  that it can provide consistency.

  Future Native Language Internet Address Service must support not only
  specific application program, but also the general naming scheme to be
  usable as an Internet Address. It should be compatible with the 
  existing service and easily extensible to the future Internet 
  applications. And it also shouldn't affect the existing services.



4. Native Language Internet Address Service

  4.1 Overview

  There exist many identification methods for our daily lives 
  a personal home page, e-mail, ICQ number, Telephone number, fax number
  and snail mail address are examples to name a few. 
  These identifiers are used in a real life without serious problems
  and it is being extended to the Internet service. In fact, I send fax
  and telephone calls using the desktop PC. Also, there is some service
  providers which allows users to have an effect of sending a snail 
  mails just by sending an e-mail in Korea.

  Native Language Internet Address will provide a framework to
  interconnect these identifiers easily. For example, I have to search
  the address book many times to send some faxes to my friends. If there
  is a fax program that can send just by typing the name of receiver, 
  the service would be much convenient.
  This problem is not limited to the fax number. We have many problems
  to memorize many identifiers and sometimes we even fail to find the
  specific identifier we need. It would be more convenient to use Native
  Language Internet Address Service not only for the fax program but
  also for many other application programs.

  4.2 NLIAS (Native Language Internet Address System)

  As mentioned above, Native Language Internet Address should evolve as a 
  form of Naming System which can resolve the queries generated from
  various applications. Differentiating this service from DNS, we call
  it as NLIAS(Native Language Internet Address System).

  
         +--- Name Server -------------+
         | +----------+  +-----------+ |
         | |          |  |           | |
         | |   DNS    |  |   NLIAS   | |
         | |          |  |           | |
         | +----------+  +-----------+ |
         +-----------------------------+


  4.3 Client Server Model

  The Native Language Internet Address System should be a C/S model like
  Domain Name System. The server should respond to the queries without
  difficulty from various users. For this, a C/S model is adequate
  because it is simple and it reduces overhead. Especially, the new
  protocol should not increase the network loads.



5. Requirements

  For the technical requirements described below, we define a "service"
  for those related to something provided to the end users and we define
  "protocol" for those related to implementation.


  5.1 Requirements for Compatibility and Interoperability

  [1] Service should be a separate system from DNS. In these days DNS is
      so important that it can be referred as Internet itself. 
      It should be a separated Naming System from DNS. After the 
      verification of stability, the attempts to integrate into DNS
      should be pursued.
  [2] Native Language Internet Address Service can provide the basic IP 
      Address in no time. Otherwise, the DNS should be queried.
  [3] The response from the same Native Language Internet Address should
      be same regardless of the server type whether it is a cache server
      or a root server.
  [4] Cache server should not respond with old data for those query.
  [5] Protocol should not depend on some specific character sets.
  [6] Unique Native Language Internet Address for each language 
      (character set) should be serviced.

Internet-Draft                      NLIAS                  November 2001

  5.2 Requirement for the Internationalization

  [1] The character set used in the service should be extended from the 
      Unicode.
  [2] Protocol should do the Name Preparation for the Native Language 
      Internet Address before the service.
  [3] Conflicts on Native Language Internet Address should be reduced by
      Name Preparation.
  [4] For the case mapping, the upper case letters should be converted
      to the lower case ones since most user use lower case letters.
  [5] Service should be based on the user's language. 


  5.3 Requirement for the service administration 

  [1] Service should be restricted to 1:1 match.
  [2] Native Language Internet Address Table should be easily modifiable
  [3] Native Language Internet Address System should not give any 
      influence on the traffic of the DNS system.
  [4] Native Language Internet Address should be maintained according to
      the character set. No two different character sets can share the
      same table. The character sets means the extension of Unicode.
  [5] Native Language Internet Address has n:1 correspondence with the 
      Internet Resource. Internet Resource means the information table
      for the Native Language Internet Address.
  [6] In a given Native Language Internet Address table, the Native 
      Language Internet Address should be unique. The same Native 
      Language Internet Address can be in another Native Language
      Internet Address table even if the Native Language Internet 
      Address implies the same meaning.
  [7] The categorization of the table is defined by that of Unicode.
  [8] A Native Language Internet Address in a given table is 
      case-insensitive. For example, "abc" and "ABC" cannot exist in the
      same table. If both exist in the same table, one of them is 
      ignored.



6. Structural Overview

  When the user types in the multi-lingual Native Language Internet 
  Address to the application, the Native Language Internet Address will
  be converted to the Unicode character string and then transmitted to
  the Native Language Internet Address Server, say A. Native Language
  Internet Address server A forwards the query to one of many root 
  Native Language Internet Address Servers, say B.

  The corresponding root server B will respond with the resource by 
  identifying the character set string based on the unicode. After this,
  Native Language Internet Address Server A caches the result so that A
  can respond for the the subsequent query for this Native Language
  Internet Address. The query should include at least the following
  information.

   [1] Native Language Internet Address
   [2] Resource Information (application information)
   [3] Language Information


  6.2 Client Side

                                   Local                     Foreign
    +-------------+ Local Code  +----------+  Unicode   |   +---------+
    |             |   String    |          |  String    |   |         |

  The end user application should be changed to accommodate the 
  internationalized native Native Language Internet Address service. 
  In other words, the resolver should take into account the multilingual
  characters. This includes the locale information of the client and the
  queried protocol information (ex: http, ftp, irc) as well as the 
  encoding of the Native Language Internet Address itself. 
  The definitions on character encoding schemes are defined in Unicode 
  Technical Report 17.

  Note) Packets should include not only the unicode Native Language
  Internet Address but also the locale and the type of the protocol.

  The packet transmitted by the resolver includes the information about
  the language used by a user or an application. Therefore, it transmits
  the query string to the authoritative server for the corresponding 
  locale. The authoritative server (Root server) searches a Native
  Language Internet Address table for the matching string and returns
  the resource information if exists.

  Native Language Internet Address Server follows these steps for the
  Native Language Internet Address.

  [1] It searches the currently maintained caches; If a matched resource
      is found, it returns the resource information. Otherwise, it asks
      for the root server query. 
  [2] Root Server returns the resource information for the queried 
      Native Language Internet Address. If no matching resource is found, 
      "NOT FOUND" will be returned instead.

  6.4 Cache Server and Root Server

  Cache Server refers a NLIAS server with no authority on the Native
  Language Internet Address zone file and does not refer to a separate
  system. This server caches the response information for some finite
  time and responds directly to the same Native Language Internet Address
  query. But it turns off the flag which indicates the response comes
  from the authorative server. If the queried Native Language Internet
  Address is not cached, it queries to the root server.

  6.5 Usage in application programs.

  There are many Internet applications. Each of these applications
  require somewhat different return values for the Native Language
  Internet Address. For the web browser, the expected result is an URL.
  For the mail client, an e-mail address should be returned for the
  Native Language Internet Address queries. This means that each
  application may require different identifiers for the same Native
  Language Internet Address. Soon there may be some telephony system
  which dials up automatically just by saying the "Native Language
  Internet Address". NLIAS should be designed to accommodate these
  applications.

  In order to satisfy these requirements, Native Language Internet
  Address System should be mapped to an information group and the
  information groups should be designed to be easily extended for
  the future applications as well as the existing applications.

   Native Language Internet Address -+- Applicaton1 - Application1 value
                                     +- Applicaton2 - Application2 value
                                     +- Applicaton3 - Application3 value

  6.6 Consideration on Internationalization

  Native Language Internet Address System is not limited to be serviced
  on English speaking regions. Various languages should be supported
  for the international service. Until now, Unicode is used as an
  encoding scheme to support the international service so far, but the
  Native Language Internet Address System should support the local
  regional codes so that it can be more extensible. Also Native Language
  Internet Address Service should be based on the local service. It can
  be supported best in the corresponding local region by the traditional
  trademark principles. Native Language Internet Address System should
  consider the legal aspect since the legal issues as well as the
  technical issues must be developed.



7. Conclusion

  As mentioned above, Native Language Internet Address Service should be 
  another connection service that makes it easier to type and memorize
  the various resources without any modification nor change on the
  existing service.
