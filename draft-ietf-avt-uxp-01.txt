               1. Abstract 
                   
                  This document specifies an efficient way to ensure erasure-resilient 
                  transmission of progressively encoded multimedia sources via RTP 
                  using Reed-Solomon codes. The level of erasure protection can be 
                  explicitly adapted to the importance of the respective parts in the 
                  source stream, thus allowing a graceful degradation of application 
                  quality with increasing packet loss rate on the network. Hence, this 
                  type of unequal erasure protection (UXP) schemes is intended to cope 
                  with the rapidly varying channel conditions on wireless access links 
                  to the Internet backbone. Nevertheless, backward compatibility to 
                  currently standardized non-progressive multimedia codecs is ensured, 
                  since equal erasure protection (EXP) represents a subset of generic 
                  UXP. By defining a comparably simple payload format, the proposed 
                  scheme can be easily integrated into the existing framework for RTP.

               2. Conventions used in this document 
                   
                  The following terms are used throughout this document: 
                   
                  1.) Message block: a higher layer transport unit (e.g. an IP 
                  packet), that enters/leaves the segmentation/reassembly stage at the 
                  interface to wireless data link layers. 
                   
                  2.) Segment: denotes a link layer transport unit. 
                   
                  3.) CRC: Cyclic Redundancy Check, usually added to transport units 
                  at the sender to detect the existence of erroneous bits in a 
                  transport unit at the receiver. 
                   
                  4.) Segmentation/Reassembly Process: If the size of the transport 
                  units at the link layer is smaller than that at the upper layers, 
                  message blocks have to be split up into several parts, i.e. 
                  segments, which are then transmitted subsequently over the link. If 
                  nothing is lost, the original message block can be restored at the 
                  receiving entity (reassembly). 
                   
                  5.) Quality-of-service: application-dependent criterion to define a 
                  certain desired operation point. 
                   
                  6.) Codec: denotes a functional pair consisting of a source encoding 
                  unit at the sender and a corresponding source decoding unit at the 
                  receiver; usually standardized for different multimedia applications 
                  like audio or video. 
                   
                  7.) Progressive source coding: results in successive blocks of 
                  (source-)encoded data (e.g. a single video or audio frame), each of 
                  which can be viewed as a bitstream of certain length, whose distinct 
                  elements are of different importance to the reconstruction process 
                  at the decoder. Elements are commonly ordered from highest to least 
                  importance, where the latter elements depend on the previous. 
                   
                  8.) Reed-Solomon (RS) code: belongs to the class of linear nonbinary 
                  block codes, and is uniquely specified by the block length n, the 
                  number of parity symbols t, and the symbol alphabet. 
                   
                  9.) n: is a variable, which denotes both the block length of a RS 
                  codeword, and the number of columns in a TB (see 16). 
                   
                  10.) k: is a variable, which denotes the number of information 
                  symbols in a RS codeword. 
                   
                  11.) t: is a variable, which denotes the number of parity symbols in 
                  a RS codeword. 
                   
                  12.) Erasure: When a packet is lost during transmission, an erasure 
                  is said to have happened. Since the position of the erased packet in 
                  a sequence is usually known, a corresponding erasure marker can be 
                  set at the receiving entity.

                  13.) Base layer: comprises the first and most important elements in 
                  a progressively encoded bitstream, without which all subsequent 
                  information is useless. 
                   
                  14.) Enhancement layer: comprises one or more sets of the less 
                  important subsequent elements in a progressively encoded bitstream. 
                  A specific enhancement layer can be decoded, if and only if the base 
                  layer and all previous enhancement layer data (of higher importance) 
                  is available. 
                   
                  15.) Info stream: denotes the final bitstream which has to be 
                  protected by the proposed UXP scheme. It usually consists of the 
                  (source-encoded) bitstream (progressive or not), which is already 
                  arranged according to a desired syntax (e.g. as specified in the 
                  respective RTP profile for the media codec in use).  
                  In any case, it is assumed that every info stream is already octet-
                  aligned according to the standard procedures defined in the context 
                  of the used syntax specifications. 
                   
                  16.) Transmission block (TB): denotes a memory array of L rows and n 
                  columns. Each row of a TB represents a RS codeword, whereas each 
                  column, together with the respective UXP header (see 33) in front, 
                  forms the payload of a single RTP packet. 
                  Each TB consists of at least two distinct transmission sub blocks 
                  (TSB, see 17): The first L_s rows belong to the signaling TSB, 
                  whereas the last L_d=(L-L_s) rows belong to one or more data TSB. 
                   
                  17.) Transmission sub block (TSB): denotes a memory array of 0<l<L 
                  rows and n columns, which is a horizontal slice of a TB. Depending 
                  on whether the info byte positions are filled with descriptors (see 
                  28) or media data, the TSB is of type signaling or data, 
                  respectively. 
                   
                  18.) L: is a variable, which denotes both the number of rows in a TB 
                  and the payload length (without UXP header) of an RTP packet in 
                  bytes. 
                   
                  19.) Unequal erasure protection (UXP): denotes a specific strategy 
                  which varies the level of erasure protection across a TB according 
                  to a given redundancy profile. 
                   
                  20.) Equal erasure protection (EXP): is a subset of UXP, for which 
                  the level of erasure protection is kept constant across a TB. 
                   
                  21.) Redundancy profile: describes the size of the different erasure 
                  protection classes in a TB, i.e. the number of rows (codewords) per 
                  class. 
                   
                  22.) Erasure protection class: contains a set of rows (codewords) of 
                  the TB with same erasure correction capability. 
                   
                  23.) i: is a variable, which denotes the number of parity bytes for 
                  each row in erasure protection class i.

                  24.) CA_i: is a variable, which denotes the set of rows contained in 
                  erasure protection class i. 
                   
                  25.) A_i: is a variable, which denotes the total number of rows 
                  contained in erasure protection class i, i.e. the cardinality of 
                  CA_i. 
                   
                  26.) T: is a variable, which denotes the number of parity bytes for 
                  each row in the highest erasure protection class (with respect to 
                  application data) in a TB. 
                   
                  27.) AV: denotes the erasure protection vector of length (T+1) used 
                  to describe a certain redundancy profile. 
                   
                  28.) DP: descriptor used for in-band signaling of the erasure 
                  protection vector. 
                   
                  29.) SI: stuffing indicator, which contains the number of media 
                  stuffing symbols at the end of a data TSB (see 31). 
                   
                  30.) Descriptor Stuffing: insertion of otherwise unused descriptor 
                  values (i.e. 0x00) at the end of the signaling TSB. Descriptor 
                  stuffing is performed, if the final sequence of descriptors and 
                  stuffing indicators for a valid redundancy profile is shorter than 
                  the space initially reserved for it in the signaling TSB. 
                   
                  31.) Media Stuffing: insertion of additional symbols at the end of a 
                  data TSB. Media stuffing is performed, if the info stream (see 15) 
                  is shorter than the space reserved for it in the data TSB for a 
                  desired redundancy profile. Since the number of stuffing symbols is 
                  signaled in the respective SI, any byte value may be used (e.g. 
                  0x00). 
                   
                  32.) Interleaver: performs the spreading of a codeword, i.e. a row 
                  in the TB, over n successive packets, such that the probability of 
                  an erasure burst in a codeword is kept small. 
                   
                  33.) UXP header: is the additional header information contained in 
                  each RTP packet after UXP has been applied. It is always present at 
                  the start of the payload section of an RTP packet. 
                   
                  34.) X: denotes a currently not used extension field of 1 bit in the 
                  UXP header. 
                   
                  35.) P: is a variable which denotes the number of parity symbols per 
                  row used to protect the inband signaling of the redundancy profile. 
                   
                  36.) ceil(.): denotes the ceiling function, i.e. rounding up to the 
                  next integer.

               3. Introduction 
                   
                  Due to the increasing popularity of high-quality multimedia 
                  applications over the Internet and the high level of public 
                  acceptance of existing mobile communication systems, there is a 
                  strong demand for a future combination of these two techniques: One 
                  possible scenario consists of an integrated communication 
                  environment, where users can set up multimedia connections anytime 
                  and anywhere via radio access links to the Internet. 
                  For this reason, several packet-oriented transmission modes have 
                  been proposed for next generation wireless standards like EGPRS 
                  (Enhanced General Packet Radio Service) or UMTS (Universal Mobile 
                  Telecommunications System), which are mostly based on the same 
                  principle: Long message blocks, i.e. IP packets, that enter the 
                  wireless part of the network are split up into segments of desired 
                  length, which can be multiplexed onto link layer packets of fixed 
                  size. The latter are then transmitted sequentially over the wireless 
                  link, reassembled, and passed on to the next network element. 
                    
                  However, compared to the rather benign channel characteristics on 
                  today's fixed networks, wireless links suffer from severe fading,
                  noise, and interference conditions in general, thus resulting in a 
                  comparably high residual bit error rate after detection and 
                  decoding. By use of efficient CRC-mechanisms, these bit errors are 
                  usually detected with very high probability, and every corrupted 
                  segment, i.e. which contains at least one erroneous bit, is 
                  discarded to prevent error propagation through the network. But if 
                  only one single segment is missing at the reassembly stage, the 
                  upper layer IP packet cannot be reconstructed anymore. The result is 
                  a significant increase in packet loss rate at IP level. 
                   
                  Since most multimedia applications can only recover from a very 
                  limited number of lost message blocks, it is vitally necessary to 
                  keep packet loss at IP level within a certain acceptable range 
                  depending on the individual quality-of-service requirements. 
                  However, due to the delay constraints typically imposed by most 
                  audio or video codecs, the use of ARQ-schemes is often prohibited 
                  both at link level and at transport level. In addition, 
                  retransmission strategies cannot be applied to any broadcast or 
                  multicast scenarios. Thus, forward erasure correction strategies 
                  have to be considered, which provide a simple means to reconstruct 
                  the content of lost packets at the receiver from the redundancy that 
                  has been spread out over a certain number of subsequent packets.  
                   
                  There already exist some previous studies and proposals regarding 
                  erasure-resilient packet transmission, of whom the most important 
                  one with respect to RTP is described in [1]. Since most of them are

                  based on the assumption that all parts in a message block are 
                  equally important to the receiver, i.e. the respective application 
                  cannot operate on partly complete blocks, they were optimized with 
                  respect to assigning equal erasure protection over the whole message 
                  block. However, recent developments both in audio and video coding 
                  have introduced the notion of progressively encoded source streams, 
                  for which unequal erasure protection strategies seem to be more 
                  promising, as it will be explained in more detail below. Although 
                  the scheme defined in [1] is in principle capable of supporting some 
                  kind of unequal erasure protection, possible implementations seem to 
                  be quite complex with respect to the gain in performance. Finally, 
                  in [1] it is assumed that subsequent RTP packets can have variable 
                  length, which would cause significant segmentation overhead at the 
                  link layer of almost all wireless systems.  
                   
                  This document defines a payload format for RTP, such that different 
                  elements in a progressively encoded multimedia stream can be 
                  protected against packet erasures according to their respective 
                  quality-of-service requirement. The general principle, including the 
                  use of Reed-Solomon codes together with an appropriate interleaving 
                  scheme for adding redundancy, follows the ideas already presented in 
                  [2], but allows for finer granularity in the structure of the 
                  progressive source stream. The proposed scheme is generic in the way 
                  that it (1) is independent of the type of multimedia stream, be it 
                  audio or video, and (2) can be adapted to varying transmission 
                  quality very quickly by use of inband-signaling. 
                
                
                
               4. Reed-Solomon Codes 
                   
                  Reed-Solomon (RS) codes are a special class of linear nonbinary 
                  block codes, which are known to offer maximum erasure correction 
                  capability with minimum amount of redundancy. 
                   
                  An arbitrary t-erasure-correcting (n,k) RS code defined over Galois 
                  field GF(q) has the following parameters [3]: 
                  - Block length:                                      n=q-1 
                  - No. of information symbols in a codeword:          k 
                  - No. of parity-check symbols in a codeword:         n-k=t 
                  - Minimum distance:                                  d=t+1 
                   
                  In what follows, only systematic RS codes over GF(2^8) shall be 
                  considered, i.e. the symbols of interest can be directly related to 
                  a tuple of eight bits, which is commonly called a byte in packet 
                  transmission. The principle structure of a codeword is shown in Fig. 
                  1. 
                  By shortening the initial (n=255,n-t) RS code, any desired (n',n'-t) 
                  RS code for a given erasure correction capability t may be obtained.

               5. Progressive Source Coding 
                   
                  If the output of a multimedia codec, be it audio or video, is said 
                  to be progressive, the encoded bitstream must consist of several 
                  distinct elements, often organized in separate layers. The latter 
                  shall be defined via their relative importance with respect to the 
                  quality of the reconstruction process at the receiver. Hence, there 
                  exists at least one layer, often called base layer, without which 
                  reconstruction fails at all, whereas all the other layers, often 
                  called enhancement layers, just help to continually improve the 
                  quality. Consequently, the different layers are usually contained in 
                  the (source-)encoded bitstream in decreasing order of importance, 
                  i.e. the base layer data is followed by the various enhancement 
                  layers. 
                  An example can be found in the fine granular scalability modes which 
                  have been proposed to various standardization bodies like MPEG-4 [4] 
                  or ITU (H.26L) [5], where the resolution of the scaling process in 
                  the progressive source encoder is as low as one symbol in the 
                  enhancement layer. 
                   
                  From the above definition, it is quite obvious that the most 
                  important base layer data must be protected as strongly as possible 
                  against packet loss during transmission. However, the protection of 
                  the enhancement layers could be continually lowered, since a loss at 
                  this stage has only minor consequences for the reconstruction 
                  process. Thus, by using a suitable unequal erasure protection 
                  strategy across a progressive source stream, the overhead due to 
                  redundancy spent per (channel-)encoded block is reduced. 
                  Furthermore, if channel conditions get worse during transmission, 
                  only more and more enhancement layers are lost, i.e. a graceful 
                  degradation in application quality at the receiver is achieved [6]. 
                
                  Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that the specific structure of 
                  a (source-)encoded bitstream strongly depends on the actual media 
                  codec in use, and the desired syntax which is used for adapting the 
                  output of the codec to a suitable transport level format (see also 
                  7.3). In order to keep the description of the unequal erasure 
                  protection strategy in section 6 as general as possible, the final 
                  bitstream which has to be protected by the proposed UXP scheme will 
                  be called "info stream" in the following. Furthermore, it is assumed

                  that every info stream is already octet-aligned according to the 
                  standard procedures defined in the context of the used syntax 
                  specifications. 
                   
                   
                   
               6. General Structure of UXP schemes 
                   
                  In this section, the principle features of the proposed UXP scheme 
                  are described with a special focus on the protection and 
                  reconstruction procedure which is applied to the info stream. In 
                  addition, the behavior of the sender and receiver is specified as 
                  far as it concerns the reconstruction of the info stream. However, 
                  the complete UXP payload structure, including the additional UXP 
                  header, is described in section 7. 
                   
                  Fig. 1 already illustrated the structure of a systematic codeword, 
                  which shall be represented by a single row and n successive columns 
                  that contain the information and the parity bytes. This structure 
                  shall now be extended by forming a transmission block (TB) 
                  consisting of L codewords of length n bytes each, which amounts to a 
                  total of L rows and n columns [7]: Each column, together with the 
                  respective UXP header in front, shall represent the payload of an 
                  RTP packet, i.e. the whole data of a TB is transmitted via a 
                  sequence of n RTP packets all carrying a payload of length (L+2) 
                  bytes (UXP header included).  
                   
                  The value of L should be chosen in such a way that the whole length 
                  of the resulting IP packet (i.e. RTP payload plus sum of RTP, UDP, 
                  and IP header) equals a multiple of the segment size on the wireless 
                  link to avoid stuffing at the data link layer. 
                   
                  Each TB usually consists of two or more horizontal slices, the so-
                  called transmission sub blocks (TSB), as can be seen in Fig. 2: The 
                  first L_s rows always belong to the signaling TSB, which is used to 
                  convey the actual redundancy profile in the data part to the 
                  receiver (see 7.3). The following L_d=(L-L_s) rows belong to one or 
                  more data TSBs, which contain the interleaved and RS encoded info 
                  stream, as will be described below.

                  Since the UXP procedure is mainly applied to the data TSBs, it will 
                  be described next, whereas the content and syntax of the signaling 
                  TSB will be defined in section 7.3. 
                   
                  For means of simplification, only one single data TSB will be 
                  assumed throughout the following explanation of the encoding and 
                  decoding procedure. However, an extension to more than one data TSB 
                  per TB is straightforward, and will be shown in section 7.4. 
                   
                  As depicted in Fig. 3, the rows of a transmission sub block shall be

                  &,%,$,¦,# : info bytes belonging to a certain info stream in 
                              decreasing order of importance 
                  * :         parity bytes gained from Reed-Solomon coding

                  Furthermore, all rows in a particular class CA_i shall contain 
                  exactly the same number of parity bytes, which is equal to the index 
                  i of the class. For each row in a certain class CA_i, the same (n,n-
                  i) RS code shall be applied. 
                   
                  As can be observed from Fig. 3, class CA_T contains the largest 
                  number of parity bytes per row, i.e. offers the highest erasure 
                  protection capability in the block. Consequently, the most important 
                  element in the info stream must be assigned to class CA_T, where the 
                  value of T should be chosen according to the desired outage 
                  threshold of the application given a certain packet erasure rate on 
                  the link.  
                  All other classes CA_(T-1)...CA_0 shall be sequentially filled with 
                  the remaining elements of the info stream in decreasing order of 
                  importance, where the optimal choice for the size of each class (0 
                  or more rows), i.e. the structure of the redundancy profile, should 
                  depend on the quality-of-service requirements for the various 
                  (progressively-encoded) layers. 
                   
                  The following set of rules contains a compact description of all the 
                  operations that must be performed for each transmission block: 
                   
                  1.) The total number of columns n of the TB shall be chosen 
                  according to the actual delay constraints of the application.

                  2.) Next, the expected number of rows reserved for the signaling TSB 
                  has to selected, which limits the data TSB to L_d=(L-L_s) rows.  
                   
                  3.) The maximum erasure correction capability T in the data TSB 
                  should be chosen according to the desired outage threshold of the 
                  application given the actual packet erasure rate on the link. 
                   
                  4.) The redundancy profile for the rest of the data TSB should 
                  depend on the size and number of the various layers in the info 
                  stream, as well as the desired probability of successful decoding 
                  for each of them (quality-of-service requirement). 
                   
                  5.) Any suitable optimization algorithm may be used for deriving an 
                  adequate redundancy profile. However, the result has to satisfy the 
                  following constraints: 
                  a) All available info byte positions in the data TSB have to be 
                  completely filled. If the info stream is too short for a desired 
                  profile, media stuffing may be applied to the empty info byte 
                  positions at the end of the data TSB by appending a sufficient 
                  number of bytes (with arbitrary value, e.g. 0x00). The actual number 
                  of stuffing symbols per data TSB is then signaled via the respective 
                  stuffing indicator (see 7.3). However, before resorting to any 
                  stuffing, it should be checked whether it is possible to strengthen 
                  the protection of certain rows instead, thus improving the overall 
                  robustness of the decoding process. 
                  b) The info stream should be fully contained within the data TSB 
                  (unless cutting it off at a specific point is explicitly allowed by 
                  the properties of the used media codec). 
                  c) The number of required descriptors and stuffing indicators (see 
                  section 7.3) to signal the profile shall not exceed the space 
                  initially reserved for them in the signaling TSB. 
                  Constraints a) and b) should be already incorporated in the 
                  optimization algorithm. However, if constraint c) is not met, the 
                  data TSB has to be reduced by one row in favor of the signaling TSB 
                  to accomodate more space for the descriptors and stuffing 
                  indicators, i.e. steps 2-5 have to be repeated until a valid 
                  redundancy profile has been obtained. 
                   
                  6.) For each nonempty class CA_i, i=T...0, in the data TSB, the 
                  following steps have to be performed: 
                  a) All rows of this specific class shall be filled from left to 
                  right and top to bottom with data bytes of the info stream in 
                  decreasing order of importance (i.e. starting with the most 
                  important element). 
                  b) For each row in the class, the required i parity-check bytes are 
                  computed from the same set of codewords of an (n,n-i) RS code, and 
                  filled in the empty positions at the end of each row. Thus, every 
                  row in the class constitutes a valid codeword of the chosen RS code. 
                   
                  7.) After having filled the whole data TSB with information and 
                  parity bytes, the redundancy profile is mapped to the signaling TSB 
                  as described in section 7.3.

                  8.) Each column of the resulting TB is now read out byte-wise from 
                  top to bottom and, together with the respective UXP header (see 
                  section 7.2) in front, is mapped onto the payload section of one and 
                  only one RTP packet. 
                    
                  9.) The n resulting RTP packets shall be transmitted subsequently to 
                  the remote host, starting with the leftmost one. 
                   
                  10.) At the corresponding protocol entity at the remote host, the 
                  payload (without the UXP header) of all successfully received RTP 
                  packets belonging to the same sending TB shall be filled into a 
                  similar receiving TB column-wise from top to bottom and left to 
                  right. 
                   
                  11.) For every erased packet of a received TB, the respective column 
                  in the TB shall be filled with a suitable erasure marker. 
                   
                  12.) Before any other operations can be performed, the redundancy 
                  profile has to be restored from the signaling TSB according to the 
                  procedure defined in section 7.3. If the attempt fails because of 
                  too many lost packets, the whole TB shall be discarded and the 
                  receiving entity should wait for the next incoming TB (the source 
                  decoder may be informed about the missing info stream, if required).  
                   
                  13.) If the attempt to recover the redundancy profile has been 
                  successful, a decoding operation shall be performed for each row of 
                  the data TSB by applying any suitable algorithm for erasure 
                  decoding. 
                   
                  14.) For all rows of the data TSB for which the decoding operation 
                  has been successful, the reconstructed data bytes are read out from 
                  left to right and top to bottom, and appended to the reconstructed 
                  version of the info stream. 
                   
                  15.) For all rows of the data TSB for which the decoding operation 
                  has failed, a sufficient number of suitable dummy symbols may be 
                  added to the reconstructed info stream to inform the source decoder 
                  about the missing symbols. 
                   
                   
                  One can easily realize that the above rules describe an interleaver, 
                  i.e. at the sender a single codeword of a TB is spread out over n 
                  successive packets. Thus, each codeword of a transmitted TB 
                  experiences the same number of erasures at exactly the same 
                  positions. 
                  Two important conclusions can be drawn from this: 
                  a) Since the same RS code is applied to all rows contained in a 
                  specific class, either all of them can be correctly decoded or not. 
                  Hence, there exist no partly decodable classes at the receiver. 
                  b) If decoding is successful for a certain class CA_i, all the 
                  classes CA_(i+1)...CA_T can also be decoded, since they are 
                  protected by at least one more parity byte per row. Together with 
                  rule 6, it is therefore always ensured, that in case a decodable

                  enhancement layer exists, all other layers it depends on can also be 
                  reconstructed! 
                   
                   
                  Given the maximum erasure protection value T, the redundancy profile 
                  for a data TSB of size (L_d x n) shall be denoted by a so-called 
                  erasure protection vector AV of length (T+1), where 
                   
                  AV:=(A_0,A_1,...,A_(T-1),A_T) 
                   
                   
                  From the above definition, it is easy to realize that the trivial 
                  cases of no erasure protection and EXP are a subset of UXP: 
                  a) no erasure protection at all: all application data is mapped onto 
                     class CA_0, i.e. AV=(L_d,0,0,...,0). 
                  b) EXP: all application data is mapped onto class CA_T, i.e.  
                     AV=(0,0,...,0,A_T=L_d). 
                   
                  Hence, backward compatibility to currently standardized non-
                  progressive multimedia codecs is definitely achieved. 
                   
                   
                
               7. RTP payload structure 
                   
                  For every packet whose payload is formed by reading out a column of 
                  the TB, the RTP header must be followed by an UXP header.  
                
               7.1. Specific settings in the RTP header 
                
                  The timestamp of each RTP packet resulting from reading out a TB is 
                  set to the time instant when the first byte of the progressive 
                  source data stream has been written into the TB. This results in the 
                  TS value being the same for all RTP packets belonging to a specific 
                  TB. 
                   
                  The payload type is of dynamic type, and obtained through out-of-
                  band signaling similar to [1]. The signaling protocol must establish 
                  a payload length to be associated with the payload type value. End 
                  systems, which cannot recognize a payload type, must discard it. 
                   
                  The marker bit is set to 1 for every last packet in a TB. Otherwise, 
                  its value is 0. 
                   
                  All other fields in the RTP header are set to those values proposed 
                  for regular multimedia transmission using the same source codecs, 
                  but no erasure protection scheme enabled. 
                   
                  The RTP payload shall consist of the UXP header followed by one 
                  column of the TB.

               7.2. Structure of the UXP header 
                   
                  The UXP header shall consist of 2 octets, and is shown in Fig. 4:

                  The fields in the header shall be defined as follows: 
                  - X (bit 0): extension bit, reserved for future enhancements,  
                               currently not in use -> default value: 0 
                   
                  - block PT (bits 1-7): regular RTP payload type to indicate the 
                                         media type contained in the info stream 
                   
                  - block length n (bits 8-15): indicates total number of RTP packets 
                                                resulting from one TB (which equals 
                                                the number of columns of the TB) 
                   
                   
                  The syntax of the info stream which is protected by UXP is specified 
                  by the RTP payload type field contained in the UXP header. For 
                  example, payload type H.263 means that the info stream conforms to 
                  the specifications of the RTP profile for H.263, but does not 
                  represent the "raw" H.263 stream produced by a H.263 encoder. 
                  However, UXP can also be applied to the raw output of the media 
                  codec (in case it is already octet-aligned), if this can be signaled 
                  to the receiver via other means, e.g. by use of H.245 or SDP. 
                   
                  Based on the RTP sequence number, the marker bit, and the repetition 
                  of the block length n in each UXP header, the receiving entity is 
                  able to recognize both TB boundaries and the actual position of lost 
                  packets in the TB. Furthermore, the specific choice of equal TS 
                  values for all RTP packets belonging to a TB allows for overcoming 
                  possible sequence number overflow. 
                   
               7.3. In-band signaling of the structure of the redundancy profile  
                   
                  To enable a dynamic adaptation to varying link conditions, the 
                  actual redundancy profile used in the data TSB must be signaled to 
                  the receiving entity. Since out-of-band signaling either results in 
                  excessive additional control traffic, or prevents quick changes of 
                  the profile between successive TBs, an in-band signaling procedure 
                  is desired. 
                   
                  As without knowledge of the correct redundancy profile, the decoding 
                  process cannot be applied to any of the erasure protection classes, 
                  it has to be protected at least as strongly as the most important

                  element in the info stream against packet loss. Therefore, an 
                  additional class CA_P is used in the signaling TSB, where the number 
                  of parity symbols is by default set to the following value: 
                    
                  P=ceil(n/2) 
                   
                  Hence, up to 50% of the RTP packets can be lost, before the 
                  redundancy profile cannot be recovered anymore. This seems to be a 
                  reasonable value for the lowest point of operation over a lossy 
                  link. Alternatively, p may be explicitly signaled during session 
                  setup by means of SDP or H.245 protocol. 
                   
                  Consequently, since all other classes must have equal or less 
                  erasure protection capability, the maximum allowable value for class 
                  CA_T in the data TSB is now limited to T<=P. 
                   
                  The signaling of the erasure protection vector is accomplished by 
                  means of descriptors. For each class CA_i with A_i>0, there is a 
                  descriptor DP_i providing information about the size of class CA_i 
                  (i.e. the value of A_i) and establishing a relationship between the 
                  erasure protection of class CA_i and that of the first preceding 
                  class CA_(i+j) with A_(i+j)>0, where j>0. A descriptor DP_i is 
                  mapped onto one byte, which is sub-divided into two half-bytes (i.e. 
                  the higher and the lower four bits). The first half-byte is of type 
                  unsigned and contains the 4-bit representation of the decimal value 
                  A_i. The second half-byte is of type signed and contains the 
                  difference in erasure protection between class CA_i and class 
                  CA_(i+j), i.e. the signed 4-bit representation of the decimal value 
                  (-j) (where the MSB denotes the sign, and the lower three bits the 
                  absolute value). Note that the erasure protection p of class CA_p is 
                  fixed, whereas the size A_p may vary. 
                   
                  Thus, the data to be filled into class CA_p shall consist of a 
                  sequence of descriptors separated by stuffing indicators (see 
                  below), where the number of descriptors is primarily given by the 
                  number of protection classes CA_i, 0<=i<=T, in the data TSB with 
                  A_i>0.  
                  Without a-priori knowledge, the initial value for the size of the 
                  signaling TSB should be set to one (row). When the number of 
                  necessary descriptors and stuffing indicators exceeds the (n-p) 
                  information positions, one or more additional rows have to be 
                  reserved. This is usually done by increasing the value for L_s to 
                  A_p>1, i.e. the data TSB is reduced to (L-A_p) rows. Hence, in order 
                  to indicate the actual size of the signaling TSB, an additional 
                  descriptor is inserted at the very beginning, which takes on the 
                  value 0xq0, where q denotes the (octal) four bit representation of 
                  the decimal value A_p. 
                   
                  Furthermore, the end of each data TSB is signaled by the otherwise 
                  unused descriptor value 0x00, followed by exactly one stuffing 
                  indicator (SI). The latter is mapped onto a byte, which is of type 
                  unsigned and contains the 8-bit representation of the decimal value

                  of the number of media stuffing symbols used at the end of the 
                  respective data TSB.  
                   
                  The (extended) sequence of descriptors and stuffing indicators is 
                  then mapped to the info byte positions in the A_p rows of the 
                  signaling TSB from left to right and top to bottom. Each row is then 
                  encoded with the same (n,n-p) RS code. 
                   
                  If the number of descriptors and stuffing indicators is less than 
                  the available info byte positions, however, empty positions in class 
                  CA_p may be filled up with the otherwise unused descriptor 0x00. 
                   
                   
                  At the receiving entity, the sequence of descriptors shall be 
                  recovered by performing erasure decoding on the first row of the TB 
                  (which definitely belongs to the signaling TSB) using the same 
                  algorithm as later for the data TSB. If successful, the very first 
                  descriptor now indicates the number of rows of the signaling TSB, 
                  and the next (A_p-1) rows are decoded to reconstruct the redundancy 
                  profile for the data TSB(s), together with the number of media 
                  stuffing symbols denoted by the respective SI(s).

                  redundancy profile 
                   
                   
                  The following simple example is meant to illustrate the idea behind 
                  using descriptors: Let an erasure protection vector of length T+1=7 
                  be given as follows: 
                  AV=(A_0,A_1,...,A_5,A_6)=(7,0,2,2,0,3,10) 
                  Hence, the length L of the TB (including one row for the signaling 
                  TSB) is equal to 7+2+2+3+10+1=25 (rows/bytes). If the width is 
                  assumed to be equal to 20 (columns/packets), then the erasure 
                  protection of the descriptors is p=10. 
                  The corresponding sequence of descriptors can be written as 
                  DP=(DP_6,DP_5,DP_3,DP_2,DP_0)=(0xAC,0x39,0x2A,0x29,0x7A), 
                  where the values of the descriptors are given in hexadecimal 
                  notation. Next, the descriptor indicating the length of the 
                  signaling TSB has to be inserted, the end of the data TSB has to be 
                  marked by 0x00, and the SI has to be appended. If the number of 
                  media stuffing symbols is assumed to be 3, the 10 info bytes in the 
                  signaling TSB take on the following values (descriptor stuffing 
                  included):

                  (0x10,0xAC,0x39,0x2A,0x29,0x7A,0x00,0x03,0x00,0x00) 
                   
                   
                  7.4 Optional Concatenation of Transmission Sub Blocks: 
                   
                  The following procedure may be applied if a single info stream would 
                  be too short to achieve an efficient mapping to a transmission block 
                  with respect to the fixed payload length L and the desired number of 
                  packets n. For example, intra-coded video frames (I-frames) are 
                  usually much larger than the following predicted ones (P-frames). In 
                  this case, a certain number z of successive small info streams 
                  should be each mapped to a transmission sub block with length L_d(y) 
                  and width n, such that L_d(1)+L_d(2)+?+L_d(z)=L_d.  
                  The resulting transmission sub blocks can then be easily 
                  concatenated to form a TB of size L x n having one common signaling 
                  TSB: Since the second half-byte of the descriptors is of type 
                  signed, we are able to incorporate both decreasing and increasing 
                  erasure protection profiles within one single signaling TSB. 
                  Note that once the lengths L_d(y) of the individual blocks have been 
                  fixed, the respective redundancy profiles can be determined 
                  independently of each other. However, the space initially reserved 
                  for the signaling TSB should be already large enough to avoid 
                  profile recalculation for each of the data TSBs in case the sequence 
                  of descriptors gets too long! 
                   
                   
                  Again, we will give a simple example to illustrate this idea: Let 
                  the erasure protection vectors for two concatenated data TSBs be 
                  given as follows: 
                   
                  AV1=(A1_0,A1_1,...,A1_5,A1_6)=(0,0,2,2,0,3,10), 
                  AV2=(A2_0,A2_1,...,A2_5,A2_6)=(0,0,2,2,0,3,10). 
                   
                  Hence, two single identical data TSBs will be concatenated to form a 
                  TB of length L=2*(2+2+3+10)+2=36 (rows/bytes). If the width is again 
                  assumed to be equal to 20 (columns/packets), then the erasure 
                  protection of the descriptors is p=10, and therefore a total of two 
                  rows for the signaling TSB have been reserved this time. The 
                  corresponding sequence of descriptors can now be written as 
                  DP=(0xAC,0x39,0x2A,0x29,0xA4,0x39,0x2A,0x29), where the values of 
                  the descriptors are given in hexadecimal notation. If the number of 
                  media stuffing symbols is assumed to be 3 for each data TSB, the 20 
                  info byte positions in the signaling TSB are filled with the

               Internet Draft        Unequal Erasure Protection         November 2001 
                
                
               8. Security Considerations 
                
                  The payload of the RTP-packets consists of an interleaved multimedia 
                  and parity stream. Therefore, it is reasonable to encrypt the 
                  resulting stream with one key rather than using different keys for 
                  multimedia and parity data. It should also be noted that encryption 
                  of the multimedia data without encryption of the parity data could 
                  enable known-plaintext attacks. 
                   
                  The overall proportion between parity bytes and info bytes should be 
                  chosen carefully if the packet loss is due to network congestion. If 
                  the proportion of parity bytes per TB is increased in this case, it 
                  could lead to increasing network congestion. Therefore, the 
                  proportion between parity bytes and info bytes per TB MUST NOT be 
                  increased as packet loss increases due to network congestion. 
                

                  The overall ratio between parity and info bytes MUST NOT be higher 
                  than 1:1, i.e. the absolute bitrate spent for redundancy must not be 
                  larger than the bitrate required for transmission of multimedia data 
                  itself. 
                   
                   
                   
               9. Application Statement 
                   
                  There are currently two different schemes proposed for unequal error 
                  protection in the IETF-AVT: Unequal Level Protection (ULP) and 
                  Unequal Erasure Protection (UXP).  
                  Although both methods seem to address the same problem, the proposed 
                  solutions differ in many respects. This section tries to describe 
                  possible application scenarios and to show the strength and 
                  weaknesses of both approaches. 
                   
                  The main difference between both approaches is that while ULP 
                  preserves the structure of the packets which have to protected and 
                  provides the redundancy in extra packets, UXP interleaves the info 
                  stream which has to be protected, inserts the redundancy information, 
                  and thus creates a totally new packet structure. 
                   
                  Another difference concerns multicast compatibility: It cannot be 
                  assumed that all future terminals will be able to apply UXP/ULP. 
                  Therefore, backward compatibility could be an issue in some cases. 
                  Since ULP does not change the original packet structure, but only 
                  adds some extra packets, it is possible for terminals which do not  
                  support ULP to discard the extra packets. In case of UXP, however, 
                  two separate streams with and without erasure protection have to be 
                  sent, which increases the bandwidth. 
                   
                  Next, both approaches offer different mechanism to adjust packet 
                  sizes, if necessary: UXP allows to adjust the packet sizes 
                  arbitrarily. This is an advantage in case the loss probability is 
                  dependent on the packet length, which happens, for example, if the 
                  end-to-end connection contains wireless links. In this case proper

               Internet Draft        Unequal Erasure Protection         November 2001 
                
                
                  adjustment of the packet size is one essential network adaption 
                  technique. In addition, if a preencoded stream is sent over the 
                  network, the packet size can be adjusted independently of slice 
                  structures.  
                  Since ULP does not change the existing packetization scheme, this 
                  flexibility does not exist. 
                   
                  The ability of UXP to adjust the packet size arbitrarily can be 
                  especially exploited in a streaming scenario, if a delay of several 
                  hundred milliseconds is acceptable. It is then possible to fill 
                  several video frames into a single TB of desired size, e.g. a group 
                  of pictures consisting of I-frame, P-frames and B-frames. The 
                  redundancy scheme can thus be selected in such a way as to guarantee 
                  the following property: In case of packet loss, the streams for P-
                  frames are only recoverable, if the I-frame, on which the decoding of 
                  P-frames depends, is recoverable. The same is true for B-frames, 
                  which can only be decoded if the respective P-frames are recoverable. 
                  This prevents situations in which, for example, the B-frames have 
                  been received correctly, but the P-frames have been lost, i.e. 
                  assures a gradual decrease in application quality also on the frame 
                  level. Of course, a similar encoding is possible with ULP. But in 
                  this case one might have to send several frames within one packet 
                  which leads to large packet sizes.  
                   
                  Finally, decoding delay is also a crucial issue in communications. 
                  Again, both approaches have different delay properties: UXP 
                  introduces a decoding delay because a reasonable amount of correctly 
                  received packets are necessary to start decoding of a TB. The delay 
                  in general depends on the dimensions of the interleaver. This should 
                  be considered for any system design which includes UXP.  
                  With ULP, every correctly received media packet can be decoded right 
                  away. However, a significant delay is introduced, if packets are 
                  corrupted, because in this case one has to wait for several 
                  redundancy packets. Thus, the delay is in general dependent on the 
                  actual ULP-FEC-packet scheme and cannot be considered in advance 
                  during the system design phase.
