      Multi-Segment Pseudowire Signaling with Availability Information 
                 draft-long-pwe3-ms-pw-availability-01.txt 


Abstract 

   This document describes a signaling mechanism for setting up a 
   multi-segment pseudowire between different domains in case that at 
   least one domain has the feature that bandwidth capacity is variable 
   for different availability values. The signaling mechanism is an 
   extension on the multi-segment pseudowire signaling [DYN-MS-PW].

1. Introduction 

   [RFC5659] describes the architecture of multi-segment pseudowire. 
   The LDP signaling mechanism for setting up multi-segement pseudowire 
   is described by [DYN-MS-PW]. The mechanism introduces a pseudowire 
   bandwidth TLV for PSN tunnel selection.  

   In some networks, there may be some links with variable bandwidth. 
   For example, in mobile backhaul network, microwave links are very 
   popular for providing connection of last hops. In case of heavy rain, 
   to maintain the link connectivity, the microwave link will lower the 
   modulation format since demodulating lower modulation format need 
   lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This is called adaptive 
   modulation technology. However, lower modulation format also means 
   lower link bandwidth. Similarly the cooper links may change their 
   link bandwidth due to external interference.

   The parameter, availability [G.827, F.1703], is often used to 
   describe the link capacity during network planning. A link may 
   provide different bandwidth for different availability requirement 
   In this case, a LSP across the links should include multiple 
   bandwidth portions with different availability guarantee. As a 
   result, only PW bandwidth requirement information is not enough for 
   the multi-segment pseudowire setup. 

   An optional PW availability TLV is introduced in this document for 
   providing enough information for S-PE to selecting PSN tunnel.

                      Figure 1 - PW Availability TLV 

   The optional PW availability TLV described by Figure 1 includes an 
   availability requirement field which is a 32-bit floating point 
   number. This field describes the availability requirement for the 
   multi-segment pseudowire. The value can be inherited from the 
   availability requirement of the emulated service. It should be 
   smaller than 1. 

   When an S/T-PE receives a PW availability TLV and a PW bandwidth TLV, 
   it will search for an PSN tunnel which can satisfy the bandwidth 
   requirement with the availability requirement. Once the PW next hop 
   is selected, the S/T-PE MUST request the appropriate resources which 
   can guarantee the required availability from the PSN. 

   In the case where PSN resources towards the next hop cannot satisfy 
   the bandwidth request with the specified the availability 
   requirement; the following procedure MUST be followed: 

     -i. The PSN MAY allocate more QoS resources, e.g. Bandwidth with 
   required availability guranttee, to the PSN tunnel. 
     -ii. The S-PE MAY attempt to setup another PSN tunnel to             
   accommodate the new PW QoS requirements. 
      -iii. If the S-PE cannot get enough resources to setup the 
   segment in the MS-PW a label release MUST be returned to the

   previous hop with a status message of "Bandwidth resources 
   unavailable" 

   In the latter case, the T-PE receiving the status message MUST also 
   withdraw the corresponding PW label mapping for the opposite   
   direction if it has already been successfully setup. 

3. Security Considerations 

   This document does not introduce new security considerations. 

4. IANA Considerations
