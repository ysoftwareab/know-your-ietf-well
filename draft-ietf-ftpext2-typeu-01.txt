                FTP Extension for Internationalized Text
                      draft-ietf-ftpext2-typeu-01

Abstract

   The original FTP protocol supported TYPE values for ASCII and EBCDIC
   text, plus binary ("IMAGE") transmission.  As the Internet becomes
   more international, there is a growing requirement to be able to
   transmit textual data, encoded in Unicode, in a way that is
   independent of the coding and line representation forms of particular
   operating systems.  This memo specifies a new FTP TYPE value for
   Unicode data.

Internet-Draft              FTP Unicode TYPE                   June 2011


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Context and Overview

   The original FTP protocol [RFC0959] supported TYPE values for ASCII
   and EBCDIC text, plus binary ("IMAGE") transmission.  The Host
   Requirements specification [RFC1123] made other changes to FTP, but
   did not alter the TYPE environment.

   As the Internet becomes more international, there is a growing
   requirement to be able to transmit textual data, encoded in Unicode
   [Unicode52], in a way that is independent of the coding and line
   representation forms of particular operating systems.  This memo
   specifies a new FTP TYPE value for Unicode data.

1.2.  Summary of History of Internationalization of FTP

   RFC 2640 [RFC2640] is described as providing internationalization of
   FTP, but only addresses the use of FTP in internationalized (non-
   ASCII or extended ASCII [ASCII]) file systems.  Its facilities were
   slightly enhanced in a more general extensions specification
   [RFC3659], which builds on a more general FTP extension mechanism
   [RFC2389].  The specification in this document addresses the transfer
   of non-ASCII text files only, building on the TYPE command of the
   original FTP specification [RFC0959].

1.3.  History of the TYPE Command

   [[Note in Draft: AppsAWG: please decide whether this subsection
   should be included in the final version as informative or dropped as
   surplus text that doesn't contribute to an implementer understanding
   of what should be done.]]

   When the FTP protocol was first defined in 1971 [RFC0114], hosts on
   the ARPANET were extremely diverse.  ASCII and EBCDIC were both in
   active use, as were several completely different character encodings,
   and ASCII was encoded in a variety of different forms inside
   different systems (TENEX/TOPS-20, Multics, Unix on 16 and then 32 bit
   architectures, and the original IBM ASCII all used different
   encodings.  In mid-1972, John McCarthy described some aspects of the
   issues [RFC0373].  Within a relatively short period of time, it was
   understood that expecting every system to adapt to the formats of
   every other system -- a fairly large n-squared problem -- was crazy
   and, at least for text, the solution was to expect all FTP-supporting
   hosts to convert between their local formats and a network-standard
   ASCII encoding and, optionally, to also identify, and permit, EBCBIC
   files to be transferred in canonical form.  The TYPE command was
   incorporated into FTP to support client specification of those forms

   for on-the-wire transfer and also to support a pair of TYPEs to
   support transferring data in forms that were likely to be operating
   system and hardware specific (see Section 2.1 for more details).

   Because of the need to handle these different text character sets and
   encoding forms without that n-squared problem, TYPE was very commonly
   used unless it was known that the sending and receiving systems were
   homogeneous.  Several arrangements for single-line FTP commands did
   not make explicit provision for TYPE specifications, but they tended
   to make exactly that homogeneity assumption.

   By the late 1980s, the ARPANET was converging toward a single host
   system architecture.  Almost all significant computer systems used 32
   bit architectures or felt an obligation to be able to simulate them.
   EBCDIC had fallen into disuse on the network.  ASCII, encoded right-
   justified in eight bits with a leading zero, had become pervasive.
   An Image transfer among diverse systems might well encounter
   differences with line termination or, occasionally, record structures
   rather than stream ones (both of which TYPE A would have smoothed
   out), but the character encodings were almost certain to be the same.
   So, with allowances for those line termination problems -- which have
   been a large issue in many cases -- Image ("binary") and ASCII
   transfers were almost equivalent and the TYPE command became less-
   used.  Some client FTP implementations also adopted an "automatic"
   mode in which they tried to determine heuristically, based on either
   file names or content inspection, whether the relevant file consisted
   of ASCII characters or binary information.  When there were only two
   choices, they often (but not always) got it right.

   However, migration to Unicode has reintroduced many of the old
   issues.  When Unicode is used inside a system, it can be used with
   several different encodings and different assumptions about
   normalization (see "Terminology for Use in Internationalization"
   [i18n-terms] for more discussion).  When those files are transferred
   to another system with Image type, the result may be completely
   uninterpretable on the target system.  This specification extends to
   non-ASCII character transfers the early concept of having a very
   small number of common/ canonical network transfer formats for
   characters, having systems able to convert to or from them.  By doing
   so, it avoids a Unicode version of the n-squared problems and general
   confusion that led to the definition of TYPE.

1.4.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft              FTP Unicode TYPE                   June 2011


   This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the
   terminology of RFC 959.  Those terms, especially reply, server-FTP
   process, user-FTP process, server-PI, user-PI, logical byte size, and
   user, if used here, are used in the same way.  It also uses the ABNF
   of [RFC2389] and [RFC5234] in preference to the BNF of RFC 959.  For
   the convenience of contemporary readers, the terms "client" and
   "server" are used interchangeably with the historic terms "user-FTP
   process" and "server-FTP process".  The document also assumes the
   termology and changes in the updates to FTP specified in RFC 1123 and
   RFC 2389.

1.5.  Discussion List

   [[anchor5: RFC Editor: please remove this section before
   publication.]]

   This proposal is being discussed in the IETF FTPEXT2 Working Group.
   Its mailing list is at ftpext@ietf.org.


2.  Specification

2.1.  Existing TYPEs

   The FTP TYPE command, described in [RFC0959] accepts four possible
   first argument values, as described below.  Note that these
   descriptions are provided for the reader's convenience; the
   definitions in RFC 959 remain normative.

   A  The data are expected to be in, and are transformed by the server
      if needed to, an ASCII [ASCII] data stream conforming to the "NVT"
      specification (See RFC 959 [RFC0959] and Appendix B of RFC 5198
      [RFC5198] for more information).

   E  The data are expected to be in, and are transformed by the server
      if needed to, an EBCDIC data stream as specified in RFC 959.

   I  The data are transferred in "image" form, i.e., exactly as they
      appear in the server.  Because it is the only TYPE form in which
      true binary data can be transferred, TYPE I is often referred to
      as "binary" or "binary transfer".

   L  The data are transmitted in logical bytes of a size specified in
      an additional argument.  See RFC 959.

   Any of these four argument variations to TYPE except "TYPE A" (with
   non-print format) MAY be rejected by the server-FTP process with a
   504 response code if it does not support that type and the necessary

   conversions.

2.2.  Unicode TYPE

   The client-PI MAY transmit TYPE U to the server-PI as an alternative
   to other TYPE commands and arguments.  If it does, the server MAY
   return reply-code 504, indicating that the TYPE U feature is not
   supported (unchanged from RFC 959) or MUST respond to any data
   retrieval request (e.g., GET) by sending the data in a stream
   conformant to the Net-Unicode format specified in Section 3.
   Similarly, if the client-PI sends TYPE U and the server accepts it,
   the client MUST send any data streams in that format while the option
   is in effect.  No second parameter is used or permitted for TYPE U.

2.3.  Data Structure

   The default and only permitted data structure for TYPE U is "file
   structure".  Use of the STRU command SHOULD be avoided.  If is used,
   its argument MUST be "F".

2.4.  Feature Negotiation

   RFC 2389 [RFC2389] specifies a feature negotiation mechanism for new
   extensions to FTP.  Since the TYPE command is a required part of the
   base FTP specification, the client-PI is not required to issue the
   FEAT command prior to issuing TYPE U. However, it MAY do so and
   Server-FTP implementations that include TYPE U SHOULD support FEAT as
   described below.  If the FEAT command is transmitted from the
   client-PI to the server-PI, and this extension and FEAT are
   supported, the response MUST include a TYPE line that lists all TYPE
   values supported by the server (including the required ones).  For
   example, if an FTP-server supports all of TYPEs A, E, I, and U, the
   FEAT response line would contain each of the possible arguments
   separated by semicolons, e.g.,

      TYPE A;E;I;U

   This specification does not change either RFC 959 or RFC 2389.  In
   particular, no FEAT response line is required for TYPE unless this,
   or some other, extension to TYPE is supported by the FTP-server.


3.  Net-Unicode Format for FTP

   This section specifies a profile of Net-Unicode [RFC5198] for use
   with FTP TYPE U.

   Unicode characters must be transmitted in UTF-8 as specified for Net-

Internet-Draft              FTP Unicode TYPE                   June 2011


   Unicode.  Because FTP is used in data transmission, the characters
   and sequences that are discouraged in Section 2 of RFC 5198 are
   permitted to be transported by FTP.  However, line-ending sequences
   MUST conform to the CRLF convention specified there.  Consistent with
   Paragraph 4 of that Section, strings SHOULD be normalized before
   transmission if at all possible.

   The implicit logical byte size for this transmission type is eight
   bits.


4.  Acknowledgments

   This document draws heavily on RFC 959; appreciation is expressed to
   its authors and to the authors of RFC 2398.  The work of Mark P.
   Peterson and Douglas J. Papenthien on other FTP extensions finally
   motivated production of this document in 2008 after a long delay;
   that contribution is appreciated as well.


5.  IANA Considerations

   When this specification is approved, an entry for "TYPE U" that
   refers to it should be incorporated into the FTP Extensions Registry
   established by RFC 5797 [RFC5797].


6.  Security Considerations

   This specification makes no substantive change to the FTP command
   stream but only alters the presentation of data in the data stream.
   Consequently, it should have no negative security implications that
   are not already present in the earlier FTP specifications described
   in Section 1 and in the Net-Unicode specification [RFC5198].  By
   specifying an exact canonical form for the identification and
   transfer of Unicode strings, it may eliminate some problems that
   might be encountered when such strings are transmitted without
   identification or without restrictions.
