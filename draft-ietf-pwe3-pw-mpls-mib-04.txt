2 Introduction 
   
  This document describes a model for managing pseudo wire services 
  for transmission over different flavors of MPLS tunnels. The 
  general PW MIB module [PW-MIB] defines the parameters global to the 
  PW regardless of underlying PSN and emulated service. Indicating 
  PSN type of MPLS in PW-MIB references this module. 
   
  This document describes the MIB objects that define pseudo wire 
  association to the MPLS PSN, in a way that is not specific to the 
  carried service.  
   
  Together, [TEMIB and LSRMIB], describe the modeling of an MPLS 
  Tunnel, and a Tunnel's underlying cross-connects. The defined MIB 
  support MPLS-TE PSN, Non TE MPLS PSN (an outer tunnel created by 
  LDP or manually), and MPLS PW label only (no outer tunnel). 
   
  Some flavors of MPLS, such as carrying PW in MPLS in IP and MPLS in 
  GRE are not defined here, waiting to the WG documents that will 
  describe the exact MPLS functionality. It still for further study 
  whether this functionality will be treated in this MIB module or in 
  another one specific to IP PSN.

Conventions used in this document 
   
  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
  this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 
  [BCP14]. 
   
3 Terminology 
   
  This document uses terminology from the document describing the PW 
  architecture [PWARCH], [PWREQ] and [PWCNTRL]. 
   
  The terms "Outbound" and "Inbound" in this MIB module are based on 
  the common practice in the MPLS standards, i.e. "outbound" are 
  toward the PSN. However, where these terms are used in an object 
  name, the object description clarifies the exact packet direction 
  to prevent confusion with these terms in other documents. 
   
  "PSN Tunnel" is a general term indicating a virtual connection 
  between the two PWE3 edge devices. Each tunnel may potentially 
  carry multiple PWs inside. In the scope of this document, it is 
  MPLS tunnel. 
   
  This document uses terminology from the document describing the 
  MPLS architecture [MPLSArch] for MPLS PSN. A Label Switched Path 
  (LSP) is modeled as described in [LSRMIB and TEMIB] via a series of 
  cross-connects through 1 or more Label switch routers (LSR). 
   
  In MPLS PSN, a PW connection typically uses a PW Label within a 
  Tunnel Label [TRANS]. Multiple pseudo wires each with a unique PW 
  Label can share the same Tunnel. For PW transport over MPLS, the 
  Tunnel Label is known as the "outer" Label, while the PW Label is 
  known as the "inner" Label. An exception to this is with adjacent 
  LSRs or the use of PHP. In this case, there is an option for PWs to 
  connect directly without an outer Label. 
   
   
4 The Internet-Standard Management Framework  
    
  For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current   
  Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 
  of RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
   
  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, 
  termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are 
  generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol 
  (SNMP). Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined 
  in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo 
  specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is

  described in STD 58,RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] 
  and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].  
    
5 Feature Checklist 
   
  The PW MPLS MIB module is designed to satisfy the following 
  requirements and constraints: 
   
   - The MIB module supports both manually configured and signaled 
     PWs. 
   
   - The MIB module supports point-to-point PW connections.  
   
   - The MIB module enables the use of any emulated service.  
   
   - The MIB supports MPLS-TE outer tunnel, Non TE MPLS outer tunnel 
     (an outer tunnel signaled by LDP or set-up manually), and no  
     outer tunnel (where the PW label is the only label in the  
     incoming MPLS stack). The later case is applicable for manual  
     configuration of PW over a single hop (in multiple hops case, it  
     is required to have an outer MPLS tunnel). 
   
   
6 MIB module usage 
   
  The MIB module structure for defining a PW service is composed from 
  three types of modules. 
   
  The first type is the PW-MIB module [PW-MIB], which configures 
  general parameters of the PW that are common to all types of 
  emulated services and PSN. 
   
  The second type of modules is per PSN module. There is a different 
  module for each type of PSN. This document defines the MIB module 
  for MPLS (PW-MPLS-MIB). 
   
  The third type of modules is service-specific module, which is 
  emulated signal type dependent. These modules are defined in other 
  documents; see for example [CEPMIB]. 
   
  [PWTC] defines some of the object types used in this module. 
   
   
6.1 PW-MPLS-MIB usage 
   
    - The PW table (pwVcTable) in [PW-MIB] is used for all PW types 
    (ATM, FR, Ethernet, SONET, etc.). This table contains high level 
    generic parameters related to the PW creation. A row is created by 
    the operator for each PW service.

                    Management Information Base 


    - If the PSN type in pwVcTable is MPLS, the agent create a row in 
    the MPLS specific parameters table (pwMplsVcTable) in PW MPLS MIB, 
    which contain MPLS specific parameters such as EXP bits handling 
    and outer tunnel types.  
     
    - The operator configure the association to the desired MPLS 
    tunnel or tunnels through either the pwMplsTeMappingTable, 
    pwMplsNonTeMappingTable or both, depending on the desired outer 
    tunnel type. Each of the above tables may contain multiple entries 
    for the same PW, for example in protection configuration. 
     
  - The agent creates rows in the MPLS outbound tunnels table 
  (pwVcMplsOutboundTable) based on the configuration above. This 
  table allows quick access to the association tables through 
  pwVcIndex ordering. 
   
  The relation to the MPLS network is by configuration of the edge 
  LSR only - that is to say, the LSR providing the PW function. Since 
  Tunnels are uni-directional, a pair of tunnels must exist (one for 
  inbound, one for outbound). The following graphic depicts a VC that 
  originates and terminates at LSR-M. It uses LSPs A and B formed by 
  Tunnels Ax and Bx continuing through LSR-N to LSR-P. The 
  concatenations of Tunnels create the LSPs. Note: 'X' denotes a 
  Tunnel's cross-connect.

  The PW-MPLS-MIB supports three options for MPLS network:

                    Management Information Base 


  - In the MPLS-TE case, Tunnel A1 and B1 are created via the MPLS-TE 
  MIB [TEMIB]. The tunnels are associated to the PW by the (4) 
  indexes that uniquely identify the Tunnel at the TE-MIB. 
   
  - In the Non TE case, Tunnel A1 and B1 are either manually 
  configured or set up with LDP. The tunnels are associated to the PW 
  by the XC index in the MPLS-LSR-MIB [LSRMIB]. 
   
  - In the PW label only case, there is no outer tunnel on top of the 
  PW label. This case is useful in case of adjacent PE only in manual 
  configuration. Note that when LSR-N acts as PHP for the outer 
  tunnel label, there are still entries for the outer tunnel in the 
  relevant MPLS MIB modules.  
   
  A combination of MPLS-TE outer tunnel(s) and LDP outer tunnel for 
  the same VC is allowed by creating the rows with the same pwVcIndex 
  with different MPLS tunnel indexes types. 
   
  It is worth noting that inbound (tunnel originated in the remote 
  PE) mapping is nor configured nor reported through the PW MPLS MIB 
  module since the local PE does not know the inbound association 
  between specific PW and MPLS tunnels. 
   
6.2 Example of MIB module usage 
   
  Please see [PW-MIB] for detailed MIB usage example.

 8 Security Considerations

                    Management Information Base 


   
  It is clear that this MIB module is potentially useful for 
  monitoring of PW capable PEs.  This MIB module can also be used for 
  configuration of certain objects, and anything that can be 
  configured can be incorrectly configured, with potentially 
  disastrous results. 
      
  There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module 
  with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such 
  objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
  environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
  environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
  network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their 
  sensitivity/vulnerability: 
   
     o    the pwVcMplsTable, pwVcMplsNonTeMappingTable and 
          pwVcMplsTeMappingTable collectively contain objects to  
          provision PW over MPLS tunnels.  Unauthorized access to  
          objects in these tables, could result in disruption of  
          traffic on the network.  The use of stronger mechanisms  
          such as SNMPv3 security should be considered where  
          possible.  Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and USM MUST be used  
          with any v3 agent which implements this MIB module.   
          Administrators should consider whether read access to these  
          objects should be allowed, since read access may be  
          undesirable under certain circumstances. 
   
  Some of the readable objects in this MIB module "i.e., objects with 
  a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible" may be considered sensitive 
  or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important 
  to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and 
  possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending 
  them over the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects 
  and their sensitivity/vulnerability: 
   
     o    the pwVcMplsTable, pwVcMplsNonTeMappingTable,  
          pwVcMplsTeMappingTable and pwVcMplsOutboundTable  
          collectively show the PW over MPLS association.   
          If an Administrator does not want to reveal this 
          information, then these tables should be 
          considered sensitive/vulnerable. 
   
  SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
  Even if the network itself is secure "for example by using IPSec", 
  even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is 
  allowed to access and GET/SET "read/change/create/delete" the 
  objects in this MIB module. 
   
  It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features 
  as provided by the SNMPv3 framework "see [RFC3410], section 8",

                    Management Information Base 


  including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms "for 
  authentication and privacy". 
   
  Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
  RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
  enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
  responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
  instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access 
  to the objects only to those principals "users" that have 
  legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET "change/create/delete" them. 
   
 9 IANA considerations 
   
  As requested in the PW-TC-STD-MIB [PWTCMIB], PWE3 related standards 
  track MIB modules should be rooted under the pwStdMIB subtree. The 
  IANA is requested to assign { pwStdMIB 3 } to the PW-MPLS-STD-MIB 
  module specified in this document.
