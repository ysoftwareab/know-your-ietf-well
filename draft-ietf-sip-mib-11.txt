Internet-Draft               SIP MIB Modules                    May 2006


1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes a set of managed objects that are used to
   manage Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) entities, which include User
   Agents, Proxy, Redirect and Registrar servers.  The managed objects
   defined in this document are intended to provide basic SIP protocol
   management for SIP entities.  The management of application-specific
   or service-specific SIP configuration is out of scope.


3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a set
   of MIB modules that are compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in
   STD 58, comprised of RFC 2578 [RFC2578], RFC 2579 [RFC2579], and RFC
   2580 [RFC2580].


4.  Overview

   SIP [RFC3261] is an application-layer control (signaling) protocol
   for creating, modifying, and terminating sessions with one or more
   participants.  These sessions include Internet telephone calls,
   multimedia distribution, and multimedia conferences.

   This MIB provides some managed objects for SIP entities defined in
   RFC 3261 [RFC3261] - User Agents, and Proxy, Redirect and Registrar
   servers: it is intended to provide management of the basic SIP
   entities.  It provides for monitoring of status and protocol
   statistics, as well as for configuration of SIP entities.

Internet-Draft               SIP MIB Modules                    May 2006


5.  Structure of the SIP MIB

   Four MIB modules are specified: SIP-COMMON-MIB, SIP-SERVER-MIB, SIP-
   UA-MIB and SIP-TC.  SIP-COMMON-MIB contains common MIB objects used
   in all the SIP entities.  SIP-SERVER-MIB contains objects specific to
   Proxy, Redirect and Registrar servers, and SIP-UA-MIB includes
   objects specific to User Agents.  SIP-TC defines the textual
   conventions used throughout MIB modules.

   The MIB modules contain following groups of objects:

   SIP-COMMON-MIB: Management objects common to all the SIP entities
   o  sipCommonMIBObjects
      *  sipCommonCfgBase: This object group defines configuration
         objects common to all SIP entities including the SIP protocol
         version, the type of SIP entity (UA, proxy, redirect, registrar
         server), the operational and administrative status, the SIP
         organization name, the maximum number of SIP transactions an
         entity can manage, etc.
      *  sipCommonCfgTimer: This object group defines timer
         configuration objects applicable to SIP user agent and stateful
         SIP proxy entities.
      *  sipCommonStatsSummary: This object group defines a table
         containing the summary statistics objects applicable to all SIP
         entities, including the total number of all SIP requests and
         responses in/out, and the total number of transactions.
      *  sipCommonStatsMethod: This object group defines a table
         containing the SIP method statistics objects applicable to all
         SIP entities, including the number outbound and inbound
         requests on a per method basis.  Retransmissions, where
         appropriate, are also included in these statistics.
      *  sipCommonStatusCode: This object group defines a table
         indicating the number of SIP responses (in and out) that the
         SIP entity has been requested to monitor on a per method basis
         (100, 200, 302, etc.).
      *  sipCommonStatsTrans: This object group defines a table
         containing a gauge reflecting the number of transactions
         currently awaiting definitive responses by the managed SIP
         entity.
      *  sipCommonStatsRetry: This object group defines statistic
         objects indicating the number of retransmissions sent on a per
         method basis.
      *  sipCommonStatsOther: This object group defines additional
         statistic objects including the number of SIP requests received
         with unsupported URIs, the number of requests received with
         unsupported SIP methods, and the number of discarded messages.

Internet-Draft               SIP MIB Modules                    May 2006


      *  sipCommonNotifObjects: This object group defines objects
         accessible only via a notification (MAX ACCESS clause of
         accessible-for-notify): they are related to the SNMP
         notifications defined in this MIB module.

   The SIP-COMMON-MIB also contains notifications, including:
   o  sipStatusCodeNotif: indicates that a specific status code has been
      sent or received by the system.
   o  sipStatusCodeThreshExceededNotif: indicates that a specific status
      code has been sent or received by the system enough to exceed the
      configured threshold.

   SIP-SERVER-MIB: Groups of objects for SIP Proxy, Redirect and
   Registrar servers
   o  sipServerMIBObjects
      *  sipServerCfg: This object group defines common server
         configuration objects including the SIP server host address.
      *  sipProxyCfg: This object group defines configuration objects
         for SIP Proxy servers including the proxy mode of operation
         (stateless, stateful, call stateful), the proxy authentication
         method(s) and realm, etc.
      *  sipProxyStats: This object group defines a table containing the
         statistics objects applicable to SIP proxy servers.  It
         includes the number of occurrences of unsupported options being
         specified in received Proxy-Require headers.
      *  sipRegCfg: This object group defines common configuration
         objects for SIP Registrar servers including the ability to
         accept third-party registrations, the maximum registration
         expiry that may be requested by user agents, the maximum number
         of users the registrar can support, the number of currently
         registered users, per contact registration information, etc.
      *  sipRegStats: This object group contains summary statistics
         objects for SIP Registrar servers, precisely, the number of
         REGISTER requests that have been accepted or rejected.

   SIP-UA-MIB: Group of objects for SIP User Agents.
   o  sipUAMIBObjects
      *  sipUACfgServer: This object group specifies SIP server
         configuration objects applicable to SIP user agents including
         the Internet address of the SIP Server to use to register,
         proxy or redirect calls.

   To conform with this specification, an SNMP agent MUST implement the
   SIP-TC MIB module, plus the SIP-COMMON-MIB module and one of the SIP
   entity-type- specific MIB modules (SIP-SERVER-MIB or SIP-UA-MIB) as
   applicable for each instance of a SIP entity being managed.  If a
   device has more than one SIP entity or multiple instances of the same
   entity type, it MUST implement multiple SIP modules.  Section 4.2

   describes handling of multiple instances in detail.

5.1.  Textual Conventions

   The data types SipTransportProtocol, SipEntityRole,
   SipOptionTagHeaders, and SipMethodName are defined in the SIP-TC MIB
   module and used as Textual Conventions in this document.

5.2.  Relationship to the Network Services MIB

   In the design of the SIP MIB, the authors considered the following
   requirement: the SIP MIB must allow a single system with a single
   SNMP agent to support multiple instances of various SIP MIB modules.
   This requirement is met by using the framework provided by the
   Network Services Monitoring MIB, NETWORK-SERVICES-MIB, RFC 2788
   [RFC2788].

   A device implementing the SIP MIB MUST support the NETWORK-SERVICES-
   MIB and, at a minimum, it MUST support the index and name objects
   (applIndex and applName) in the application table (applTable).  In
   order to allow each instance of a SIP entity to be managed as a
   separate network service application, a naming convention SHOULD be
   used to make the application name unique.  For example, if a system
   is running 2 SIP UAs that need to be managed as 2 separate SIP
   entities, by convention, the application names used in the Network
   Services Monitoring MIB application table should be "sip_ua1" and
   "sip_ua2".  This convention allows each instance to have its own row
   in the application table (applTable).

   It is therefore RECOMMENDED to adopt the following application name
   conventions:
   o  for a SIP Proxy entity, the applName value SHOULD be equal to a
      character string starting with "sip_proxy" followed by a unique
      application instance identifier, for example, "sip_proxy1",
      "sip_proxy17"
   o  for a SIP Registrar entity, the applName value SHOULD be equal to
      a character string starting with "sip_registrar" followed by a
      unique application instance identifier, for example,
      "sip_registrar1", "sip_registrar2"
   o  for a SIP User Agent entity, the applName value SHOULD be equal to
      a character string starting with "sip_ua" followed by a unique
      application instance identifier, for example, "sip_ua1", "sip_ua2"
   o  for any combination of Proxy, Registrar, or Redirect Server being
      managed as a single aggregate entity, the applName value for the
      combined server entity MUST reflect the appropriate combination
      followed by a unique application instance identifier.  In order to
      facilitate consistent agent behavior and management application
      expectations, the following order of names is RECOMMENDED:

Internet-Draft               SIP MIB Modules                    May 2006


      *  if Proxy exists, list first.
      *  if Proxy and Redirect exists, list Redirect second.
      *  if Registrar exists, always list last.
      For example "sip_proxy1", "sip_proxy_registrar1",
      "sip_proxy_redirect5", "sip_proxy_redirect_registrar2", or
      "sip_registrar1".
   o  Note: the value of the network service application index
      (applIndex) may be different from the instance identifier used in
      the system (the applIndex is dynamically created and the value
      assigned by the SNMP agent at the creation of the table entry
      whereas the value of the instance identifier to be used in the
      application name is provided as part of the application name
      applName by the system administrator or configuration files of the
      SIP entity).  This note is illustrated in the first example
      provided below.

   Finally, the SNMP agent MAY support any combination of the other
   attributes in applTable.  If supported, the following objects SHOULD
   have values populated as follows:
   o  applVersion: version of the SIP application,
   o  applUptime: the value of applUptime MUST be identical to the value
      of sipServiceStartTime defined in the SIP-COMMON-MIB module,
   o  applOperStatus: the value of applOperStatus SHOULD reflect the
      operational status of sipServiceOperStatus, at least by means of a
      mapping,
   o  applLastChange: the value of applLastChange MUST be identical to
      the value of sipServiceLastChange defined in the SIP-COMMON
      module.

   A number of other objects are defined as part of the applTable.  They
   are not included for the sake of brevity and due to the fact that
   they do not enhance the concept being presented.

   Example 1: The tables below illustrate how a system acting as both
   Proxy and Registrar server might be configured to maintain separate
   SIP-COMMON-MIB instances.

     The NETWORK-SERVICES-MIB applTable might be populated as follows:

         +-----------+-------------------+----------------------+
         | applIndex |      applName     |    applDescription   |
         +-----------+-------------------+----------------------+
         |     1     |   "sip_proxy10"   |   "ACME SIP Proxy"   |
         |     2     | "sip_registrar17" | "ACME SIP Registrar" |
         +-----------+-------------------+----------------------+

   The SIP-COMMON-MIB sipCommonCfgTable would have two rows: one for the
   proxy (applIndex=1) and one for the registrar (applIndex=2).  The

Internet-Draft               SIP MIB Modules                    May 2006


   SIP-SERVER-MIB tables would, however, only be populated with one row
   indexed by applIndex=1 and applIndex=2 respectively if the server
   provides either proxy or registrar.

          SIP-COMMON-MIB sipCommonCfgTable might be populated as:

      +-----------+--------------------+----------------------+-----+
      | applIndex | sipProtocolVersion | sipServiceOperStatus | ... |
      +-----------+--------------------+----------------------+-----+
      |     1     |      "SIP/2.0"     |         up(1)        |  2  |
      | "SIP/2.0" |    restarting(4)   |                      |     |
      +-----------+--------------------+----------------------+-----+

      while sipProxyCfgTable in SIP-SERVER-MIB might be populated as:

                +-----------+----------------------+-----+
                | applIndex | sipProxyStatefulness | ... |
                +-----------+----------------------+-----+
                |     1     |     stateless(1)     |     |
                +-----------+----------------------+-----+

       and sipRegUserTable in SIP-SERVER-MIB might be populated as:

          +-----------+--------------+-------------------+-----+
          | applIndex | sipUserIndex |     sipUserUri    | ... |
          +-----------+--------------+-------------------+-----+
          |     2     |       1      |  bob@example.com  |     |
          |     2     |       2      | alice@example.com |     |
          |     2     |       3      |  jim@example.com  |     |
          |     2     |       4      |  john@example.com |     |
          +-----------+--------------+-------------------+-----+

   Example 2:

   This example illustrates how to represent a system acting as both
   Proxy and Registrar server, where the two entities share a single
   instance of SIP-COMMON-MIB.

     The NETWORK-SERVICES-MIB applTable might be populated as follows:

   +-----------+------------------------+------------------------------+
   | applIndex |        applName        |        applDescription       |
   +-----------+------------------------+------------------------------+
   |     1     | "sip_proxy_registrar1" |      "ACME SIP Proxy and     |
   |           |                        |          Registrar"          |
   +-----------+------------------------+------------------------------+

   The SIP-COMMON-MIB sipCommonCfgTable would have only one row to cover

Internet-Draft               SIP MIB Modules                    May 2006


   both the proxy and the registrar.

          SIP-COMMON-MIB sipCommonCfgTable might be populated as:

         +-----------+--------------------+----------------------+
         | applIndex | sipProtocolVersion | sipServiceOperStatus |
         +-----------+--------------------+----------------------+
         |     1     |      "SIP/2.0"     |         up(1)        |
         +-----------+--------------------+----------------------+

      while sipRegUserTable in SIP-SERVER-MIB might be populated as:

          +-----------+--------------+-------------------+-----+
          | applIndex | sipUserIndex |     sipUserUri    | ... |
          +-----------+--------------+-------------------+-----+
          |     2     |       1      |  bob@example.com  |     |
          |     2     |       2      | alice@example.com |     |
          |     2     |       3      | kevin@example.com |     |
          |     2     |       4      |   jf@example.com  |     |
          +-----------+--------------+-------------------+-----+

   The NETWORK-SERVICES-MIB assocTable is not considered a requirement
   for SIP systems.  It is not a mandatory group for compliance with the
   NETWORK-SERVICES-MIB module.

         The relationship between the value of applOperStatus and
                    sipServiceOperStatus is as follows:

   +----------------------+-----------------------+-------------------+
   | sipServiceOperStatus | -- corresponds to --> |   applOperStatus  |
   +----------------------+-----------------------+-------------------+
   |          up          |          -->          |         up        |
   |         down         |          -->          |        down       |
   |       congested      |          -->          |     congested     |

   If the sipOperStatus is 'unknown' there is no corresponding value of
   applOperStatus.  Therefore, the last known value of applOperStatus
   SHOULD be maintained until the sipOperStatus transitions to a value
   that can be mapped appropriately.

Internet-Draft               SIP MIB Modules                    May 2006


5.3.  IMPORTed MIB Modules and REFERENCE Clauses

   The SIP MIB modules defined in this document IMPORT definitions
   normatively from the following MIB modules, beyond [RFC2578],
   [RFC2579] and [RFC2580]: INET-ADDRESS-MIB [RFC4001], NETWORK-
   SERVICES-MIB [RFC2788], SNMP-FRAMEWORK-MIB [RFC3411].

   This MIB module also includes REFERENCE clauses that normatively
   refer to SIP [RFC3261], and INET-ADDRESS-MIB [RFC4001].

   Finally, this MIB module makes informative references to several RFCs
   in some of the examples described in the DESCRIPTION clauses,
   including Reliability of Provisional Responses in SIP [RFC3262], and
   SIP over SCTP [RFC4168].


6.  Accommodating SIP Extension Methods

   The core set of SIP methods is defined in RFC 3261 [RFC3261].  Other
   IETF RFCs define additional methods.  In the future, additional
   methods may be defined.  In order to avoid having to update the SIP-
   COMMON-MIB module to accommodate these extension methods, we use a
   method identifier name (SipMethodName textual-convention) to
   represent all SIP methods registered with IANA.  See IANA
   Consideration section.

   For example, the sipMethodSupportedTable is the main table for
   listing all of the SIP methods supported by a system, including the
   SIP methods defined in RFC 3261 [RFC3261] and other SIP methods
   registered with IANA.  The table is informational in nature and
   populated by the system.  Entries cannot be added or deleted by a
   SNMP manager.

   The SIP specification RFC 3261 [RFC3261] section 27.4 establishes the
   sub-registries for SIP Methods and Response Codes under
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters.  This document uses
   the existing sub-registry for the names of registered SIP method.

   For example, in the sipSupportedMethodTable of SIP-COMMON-MIB, the
   sipMethodName values can be represented as follows:

           DESCRIPTION
                "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Common MIB module.
                 This module defines objects which MAY be common to all
                 SIP entities.

                 SIP is an application-layer signaling protocol for
                 creating, modifying and terminating multimedia
                 sessions with one or more participants. These sessions
                 include Internet multimedia conferences and Internet
                 telephone calls.  SIP is defined in RFC 3261 (June
                 2002).

                 This MIB is defined for managing objects which are
                 common to SIP User Agents (UAs), Proxy, Redirect

                 and Registrar servers.  Objects specific to each of
                 these entities MAY be managed using entity specific
                 MIBs defined in other modules.

                 User Agent (UA): A logical entity that can act as both
                 a user agent client and user agent server.
                 User Agent Client (UAC): A logical entity that creates
                 a new request, and then uses the client
                 transaction state machinery to send it. The role of UAC
                 lasts only for the duration of that transaction.  In
                 other words, if a piece of software initiates a
                 request, it acts as a UAC for the duration of that
                 transaction.  If it receives a request later, it
                 assumes the role of a user agent server for the
                 processing of that transaction.
                 User Agent Server (UAS): a logical entity that
                 generates a response to a SIP request.  The
                 response accepts, rejects, or redirects the request.
                 This role lasts only for the duration of that
                 transaction.  In other words, if a piece of software
                 responds to a request, it acts as a UAS for the
                 duration of that transaction.  If it generates a
                 request later, it assumes the role of a user
                 agent client for the processing of that
                 transaction.

                 Proxy, Proxy Server: An intermediary entity that acts
                 as both a server and a client for the purpose of making
                 requests on behalf of other clients.  A proxy server
                 primarily plays the role of routing, which means its
                 job is to ensure that a request is sent to another
                 entity 'closer' to the targeted user.
                 Proxies are also useful for enforcing policy.  A proxy
                  interprets, and, if necessary, rewrites specific parts
                  of a request message before forwarding it.

                 Redirect Server: A redirect server is a user agent
                 server that generates 3xx responses to requests it
                 receives, directing the client to contact an alternate
                 set of URIs.

                 Registrar: A registrar is a server that accepts
                 REGISTER requests and places the information it
                 receives in those requests into the location service
                 for the domain it handles.

                A transaction is identified by the CSeq sequence number

           DESCRIPTION
                "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agent (UA)
                 MIB module.

                 SIP is an application-layer signaling protocol for
                 creating, modifying and terminating multimedia
                 sessions with one or more participants. These sessions
                 include Internet multimedia conferences and Internet
                 telephone calls.  SIP is defined in RFC 3261 (June
                 2002).

                 A User Agent is an application that contains both a
                 User Agent Client (UAC) and a User Agent Server (UAS).
                 A UAC is an application that initiates a SIP request.
                 A UAS is an application that contacts the user when a
                 SIP request is received and that returns a response on
                 behalf of the user.  The response accepts, rejects, or
                 redirects the request.

                 of this MIB module is part of RFC XXXX; see the RFC

              DESCRIPTION
                   "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Server MIB module.
                    SIP is an application-layer signaling protocol for
                    creating, modifying and terminating multimedia
                    sessions with one or more participants. These
                    sessions include Internet multimedia conferences and
                    Internet telephone calls.  SIP is defined in
                    RFC 3261 (June 2002).

                    This MIB is defined for the management of SIP Proxy,
                    Redirect and Registrar Servers.

                    A Proxy Server acts as both a client and a server.
                    It accepts requests from other clients, either
                    responding to them or passing them on to other
                    servers, possibly after modification.

                    A Redirect Server accepts requests from clients and
                    returns zero or more addresses to that client.
                    Unlike a User Agent Server it does not accept calls.

                    A Registrar is a server that accepts REGISTER
                    requests.  A Registrar is typically co-located with
                    a Proxy or Redirect Server.

                  for the Proxy Server entity.

                   A stateless proxy is a logical entity that does not
                   maintain the client or server transaction state
                   machines when it processes requests. A stateless
                   proxy forwards every request it receives downstream
                   and every response it receives upstream. If the value
                   of this object is stateless(1), the proxy defaults to
                   stateless operations.

                   A transaction stateful proxy, or simply a 'stateful
                   proxy', is a logical entity that maintains the client
                   and server transaction state machines during the
                   processing of a request. A (transaction) stateful
                   proxy is not the same as a call stateful proxy. If
                   the value if this object is transactionStateful(2),
                   the proxy is stateful on a transaction basis.

                   A call stateful proxy is a logical entity if it
                   retains state for a dialog from the initiating INVITE
                   to the terminating BYE request.  A call stateful

8.  IANA Considerations

     The MIB modules defined in this document use the following IANA-
       assigned OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers
                                 registry:

                +--------------+-------------------------+
                | Descriptor   | OBJECT IDENTIFIER value |
                +--------------+-------------------------+
                | sipTC        | { mib-2 XXX1 }          |
                | sipCommonMIB | { mib-2 XXX2 }          |
                | sipUAMIB     | { mib-2 XXX3 }          |
                | sipServerMIB | { mib-2 XXX4}           |
                +--------------+-------------------------+

     -- RFC Ed:(note to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign 4 values in the SMI Numbers registry for "XXX1",
     "XXX2", "XXX3", and "XXX4", all under the 'mib-2' sub-tree and to
       record the assignments in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignments have been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX1"
   through "XXX4" (here and in the 4 MIB modules) with the corresponding
                  assigned value and to remove this note.


9.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in the SIP-COMMON-
   MIB MIB module with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-
   create.  Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in
   some network environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-
   secure environment without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.

   The following read-create object in SIP-COMMON-MIB is used to
   configure the status code statistics that will be monitored by the
   SIP entity:




Lingle, et al.          Expires November 18, 2006              [Page 76]

Internet-Draft               SIP MIB Modules                    May 2006


      sipStatusCodeRowStatus:
      if this object is SET maliciously, it may result in an over
      allocation of resources in a system for the purpose of
      accumulating and maintaining statistics.

   The following read-write objects in SIP-COMMON-MIB are used to
   configure the behavior of certain SNMP notifications potentially
   generated by a SIP entity:
      sipStatusCodeNotifSend, sipStatusCodeNotifEmitMode,
      sipStatusCodeNotifThresh, sipStatusCodeNotifInterval,
      sipServiceNotifEnable:
      If these objects are SET maliciously, it may result in a system
      and/or network performance impact due to the generation of SNMP
      notifications.

   Some of the readable objects in the MIB modules (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.

   The following object values may contain private or confidential
   customer information like first name, last name, customer
   identification, location, company affiliation, the time the
   information was updated, etc.
      sipContactDisplayName, sipContactURI, sipContactLastUpdated and
      sipOrganization.

   The sipCommonCfgTable table contains some objects that may help
   attackers gain knowledge about the status and operations of the SIP
   service.  In particular, the object value of sipServiceOperStatus may
   indicate that the SIP entity is in congested state and may lead
   attackers to build additional service attacks to overload the system.

   The sipEntityType object indicates the type of SIP entity and the
   sipMethodSupportedTable table contains in the SIP-COMMON-MIB MIB
   module list of SIP methods supported by each entity in the system.
   Gaining access to this information may allow attackers to build
   method specific attacks or use unsupported methods to create denial
   of service attack scenarios.

   In the SIP-UA-MIB MIB module, the sipUACfgServerTable contains the
   address of the SIP servers providing services to the UA and obtaining
   this information may disclose some private or sensitive information
   about the SIP service usage.

   In the SIP-SERVER-MIB MIB module, the sipProxyAuthMethod object



Lingle, et al.          Expires November 18, 2006              [Page 77]

Internet-Draft               SIP MIB Modules                    May 2006


   defines the authentication methods supported by the server and may be
   used to build specific denial of service attackers targeted at the
   security mechanisms employed by the SIP entity.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this set of MIB modules.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see RFC 3410 [RFC3410]), including
   full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

      sipCommonInformationalGroup;
   o  updated DESCRIPTION of sipProxyAuthRealm to indicate that this
      object is the *default* realm value used by the proxy in Proxy-
      Authenticate headers and, added a note to say that in case of per
      user storage, the default value is ignored by the proxy.
   o  removed sipRegAllowThirdParty because no registrar implementer
      seems to track them differently internally (no comment on the
      list), and a registrar would have to implement new logic in order
      to be able to exercise this part of the mib.
   o  added a couple of references like RFC 3262 and RFC 4168.

   Changes from draft-ietf-sip-mib-09.

   The changes were minimal and mostly done to address MIB doctor
   comments on SipMethodIdentifier.  The list of changes includes:
   o  removal of SipMethodIdentifier textual convention per MIB doctor
      feedback
   o  updates of normative references (e.g.  RFC 3291 --> RFC 4001)
   o  added a new section to provide a citation to IMPORTed RFCs as they
      are norm. references

   Changes from draft-ietf-sip-mib-08.

   The majority of changes are in response to additional SIP Working
   Group comments.
   o  General
      *  The IANA Consideration section was updated and a new section
         9.2 was added to conform with the Guidelines for Authors and
         Reviewers of MIB Documents,
         draft-ietf-ops-mib-review-guidelines-03.txt, section 3.7.
      *  In general the ability to configure SIP entities via read-
         create or read-write objects was removed and those objects MAX-
         ACCESS constrained to read-only.  This change was made based on
         general consensus that SNMP should be limited to monitoring
         rather than configuring/provisioning.
      *  The section 5.2 (Relationship to the Network Services MIB) was
         updated to allow each instance of a SIP entity to have its own
         row in the applTable (a unique application identifier should
         now be appended to the "sip_xxx" entity-name).  We also lowered
         the level of requirement on the naming convention to a SHOULD
         instead of a MUST per wg input.
      *  Updated the ORGANISATION clause of all MIB modules to include
         the full SIP working group name.

      *  Updated Security consideration section.
   o  SIP-COMMON-MIB
      *  Module description of various SIP entities enhanced.
      *  sipServiceAdminStatus removed from the MIB due to general

      *  sipCfgTimerT4 MAX-ACCESS changed to read-only.
      *  sipStatusCodesTable indexing changed to also include
         sipStatusCodeMethod.  Thusly, introducing sipStatusCodeMethod
         as a new not-accessible object in that table.  Resulting OID
         value changes to succeeding entry objects.
      *  sipCfgTimer* OBJECT clauses regarding MIN-ACCESS levels in the
         MODULE-COMPLIANCE were no longer needed due to MAX-ACCESS
         changes for those objects.
      *  The description clause of sipStatsInbounds was changed to state
         that retransmissions are not counted.
      *  The description clause of sipStatsRetries was changed to
         indicate there could be multiple retries per request (we also
         corrected a typo by removing the specific mention to INVITE
         requests).
      *  The description clause of sipStatsRetryFinalResponses was
         changed to indicate there could be multiple retries per
         response.
   o  SIP-SERVER-MIB
      *  Removed sipCommonCfgExpires OID declaration as this object
         group no longer exists since draft08.
      *  sipUserTableRowStatus removed from the MIB due to general
         removal of configuration capability.  In conjunction, RowStatus
         textual convention is no longer imported.

      *  sipUACfgServerAddr MAX-ACCESS changed to read-only.
      *  sipUACfgServerFunction MAX-ACCESS changed to read-only.

   Changes from draft-ietf-sip-mib-07.

   The vast majority of changes are in response to the Working Group
   Last Call and expert review comments.
   o  General
      *  IANA requirements section added to specify the need for
         registered numbers for all SIP methods.  These will be used in
         the MIB objects.
      *  Updated the security consideration section to reflect the
         addition and deletion of a number of objects.
   o  SIP-COMMON-MIB
      *  Module description of various SIP entities enhanced.
      *  sipMaxSessions renamed sipMaxTransactions.  Workgroup last call
         reviewers suggested a change based on some change of terms in
         the standard.  Transactions seemed the appropriate term.  The
         object description was also enhanced.
      *  sipRequestUriHostMatching object removed based on comments from
         workgroup last call comments.
      *  sipEntityType changed from enumerated INTEGER to SipEntityRole
         textual convention syntax.
      *  sipServiceAdminStatus enumerated value 'quiesceSessions'
         changed to 'quiesceDialogs'.
      *  sipPortTable was redesigned. sipTransportSnd object was removed
         as it did not make much sense. sipPortStatus was removed to
         prevent any row creation deletion.  The remaining object,
         sipTransportRcv was made read-only.
      *  sipUriSupportedTable was removed as it was not deemed useful
         anymore.
      *  sipExtMethodSupportedTable replaced with a general
         sipMethodSupportedTable.  IANA SIP method identifiers/numbers
         will be used in this new table.  The previous concept of
         explicitly defining objects per the current well-know methods

         and then providing separate, semantically similar, 'extension
         methods' tables has been eliminated.
      *  sipCommonCfgTimerExtMethodTable was removed.  No more need for
         'extension methods' tables.
      *  sipCommonCfgRetryTable was removed.  Limits on retransmissions
         are controlled by timers in the SIP standard now rather than by
         maximum counts; therefore, these objects were no longer
         relevant. sipCommonConfigRetryGroup was likewise removed.
      *  sipFtrSupportedTable was redesigned as sipOptionTagsTable.
      *  sipCommonCfgTimerExtMethodTable was removed.
      *  sipSummaryTotalTransactions description changed to reflect that
         in the case of forked request, _each_ branch rather than _all_
         branches count as a single transaction.
      *  sipMethodStatsTable was redesigned, taking into account the new
         SipMethodIdentifer textual convention.  The objects were
         generalized to two: sipStatsOutbound and sipStatsInbound.  The
         indexing object (sipStatsMethod) has syntax SipMethodIdentifier
         and thereby identifies the method associated with the instances
         of in/out counter objects.
      *  sipCurrentTransactions description changed to reflect that in
         the case of forked request, _each_ branch rather than _all_
         branches count as a single transaction.
      *  sipCommonStatsRetryTable was redesigned, taking into account
         the new SipMethodIdentifer textual convention.  A single,
         generalize object (sipStatsRetries) replaces several method-
         specific objects.  The new, additional indexing object
         (sipStatsRetryMethod) has syntax SipMethodIdentifier and
         thereby identifies the method associated with the instances of
         the counter objects in each row.
      *  sipCommonStatsRetryExtMethodTable was removed.
      *  sipStatusCodeClassesTable removed.
      *  sipOtherStatsTable has two new objects added:
         sipNumUnsupportedMethods and sipOtherwiseDiscardedMsgs.
      *  The following object-groups were removed because their
         associated objects were removed:
         sipCommonConfigTimerExtMethodGroup, sipCommonConfigRetryGroup,
         sipCommonConfigRetryExtMethodGroup,
         sipCommonStatsRetryExtMethodsGroup, and
         sipCommonConfigExpiresGroup.  The references to these object-
         groups as optional in the module-compliance was updated
         accordingly.
      *  GROUP clause for sipCommonStatsRetryGroup in module-compliance
         was udpated to no longer state any dependency on
         sipCommonConfigRetryGroup (now removed).
      *  New OBJECT clauses were added to the module-compliance to
         formalize MIN-ACCESS read-only for objects in
         sipCommonCfgTimerTable.

      *  sipCommonConfigGroup udpated with new objects (sipOptionTag,
         sipOptionTagHeaderField, sipMethodName), removed objects
         (sipTransportSnd, sipPortStatus, sipUriSupported,
         sipFtrSupported, sipExtMethodName, sipRequestUriHostMatching),
         and changed objects (sipMaxTransactions).
      *  sipCommonStatsGroup updated with new objects
         (sipStatsOutbounds, sipStatsInbounds, sipNumUnsupportedMethods,
         sipOtherwiseDiscardedMsgs) and removed objects
         (sipStatsInviteIns, sipStatsInviteOuts, sipStatsAckIns,
         sipStatsAckOuts, sipStatsByeIns, sipStatsByeOuts,
         sipStatsCancelIns, sipStatsCancelOuts, sipStatsOptionsIns,

         sipStatsRedirClassIns, sipStatsRedirClassOuts,
         sipStatsReqFailClassIns, sipStatsReqFailClassOuts,
         sipStatsServerFailClassIns, sipStatsServerFailClassOuts,
         sipStatsGlobalFailClassIns, sipStatsGlobalFailClassOuts,
         sipStatsOtherClassesIns, sipStatsOtherClassesOuts).
      *  sipCommonStatsRetryGroup updated with new object
         (sipStatsRetries) and removed objects (sipStatsRetryInvites,
         sipStatsRetryByes, sipStatsRetryCancels,
         sipStatsRetryRegisters, sipStatsRetryOptions).
   o  SIP-SERVER-MIB
      *  Module description of various SIP entities enhanced.
      *  sipServerStats 'placeholder' IOD removed.  No objects were ever
         defined under that subtree.
      *  Removed the following objects from sipProxyCfgTable:
         sipRequestMaxExpires, sipProxySendsCancel,
         sipProxyForwardAll1xx, sipProxyProvideAlternatives, and
         sipProxyNonceLifeTime. sipProxyConfigGroup updated accordingly.
      *  sipProxyStatefulness MAX-ACCESS changed to read-only.
      *  DEFVAL removed from sipRegMaxContactExpiryDuration.
      *  sipContactRetryAfter removed from sipContactTable.
      *  sipUser* and sipContact* objects were moved from
         sipRegistrarConfigGroup to a new object-group:
         sipRegistrarUsersGroup.  The new group was made an optional
         group in the MODULE-COMPLIANCE.
   o  SIP-UA-MIB
      *  SipEntityRole imported from SIP-TC module and used as the
         syntax for new object sipUACfgServerFunction.
      *  sipUACfgSipServerTable (and objects therein) have their
         descriptors changed to sipUACfgServer* ("Sip" removed).
         sipUAConfigGroup updated accordingly.
      *  sipUACfgServerFunction added to sipUACfgServerTable.

      *  DEFVAL { ipv4 } removed from sipUACfgServerAddrType.
   o  SIP-TC
      *  New textual conventions: SipEntityRole, SipOptionTagHeaders,
         and SipMethodIdentifier added.

   Changes from draft-ietf-sip-mib-06
   o  General
      *  Minor editorial changes in the Textual Conventions section.
   o  SIP-COMMON-MIB
      *  sipStatusCodeValue SYNTAX changed from INTEGER to Unsigned32.
      *  Optional sipCommonNotifObjectsGroup explicitly added to MODULE-
         COMPLIANCE.
      *  Removed OBJECT refinement for sipStatusCodeRowStatus added to
         compliance in previous revision.  SMIC MIB compiler issues
         required it to be commented out.  Instead, simply removed it.
   o  SIP-SERVER-MIB
      *  Removed OID placeholders: sipRedirCfg, sipRedirStats. sipRegCfg
         and sipRegStats OID values subsequently changed as a result.
   o  SIP-UA-MIB
      *  Removed OBJECT refinement for sipUACfgSipServerStatus added to
         compliance in previous revision.  SMIC MIB compiler issues
         required it to be commented out.  Instead, simply removed it.

   Changes from draft-ietf-sip-mib-05
   o  Front paper/Back paper and General changes
      *  Removed all references and special handling of SIP INFO method
         Removed references and objects specific to RFC 2976: INFO will
         be treated as any SIP extension method.
      *  Changed requirements verbs from lowercase to uppercase wherever
         appropriate.
      *  Added RFC Editor notes.
      *  Updated all REFERENCE clauses and DESCRIPTIONS from RFC 2543 to
         RFC 3261.
      *  Explained the approach taken for extension methods that might
         be defined in the future.
      *  Defined a mapping of sipServiceOperStatus to applOperStatus.
      *  Enhanced Security section with details on various objects.
      *  Added descriptive language to various Entry objects regarding
         the expected persistence of data across system restarts.
   o  SIP-COMMON-MIB
      *  Removed sipTransactionTable after input from SIP community.
      *  Made all extension method tables augmentations of
         sipExtMethodSupportedTable.  This resulted in the removal of
         the following objects: sipCfgTimerExtMethodName,
         sipCfgRetryExtMethodName, sipStatsExtMethodName,
         sipStatsRetryExtMethodName.

      *  sipCommonStatusCodeNotifEmitMode default value changed to
         'triggered'.
      *  sipStatusCodeThreshExceededNotif was replaced by two
         notifications: sipStatusCodeThreshExceededOutNotif and
         sipStatusCodeThreshExceededInNotif.
      *  Re-arranged the enumerated value of sipServiceOperStatus;
         making 'unknown' the first value.  Added some words to the
         DESCRIPTION of that object stating the values are not based on
         anything in the SIP standard.
      *  Clarified rules for capitalization of sipExtMethodName.
      *  All counters in the MIB are consistent with respect to
         resetting to zero.  No counters can be reset to zero.  Entries
         in sipStatusCodesTable can simply be created or destroyed - no
         ability to set to 'notInService' where there was the question/
         possibility of resetting the counters to zero.
         sipStatsExtMethodTable no longer has its own RowStatus object,
         so it too can no longer be set to 'notInService' where there
         was the question/possibility of resetting the counters to zero.
         sipStatsExtMethodTable rows are augmentations of
         sipExtMethodSupportedEntry.
      *  OBJECT refinement for sipStatusCodeRowStatus added to
         compliance.
      *  Clarified the relationship between
         sipCommonStatusCodeNotifEmitMode and
         sipCommonStatusCodeNotifSend.
      *  Explained the existence of sipNotifApplIndex object better.
      *  sipCfgExpiresStatusCodeValue syntax changed from INTEGER to
         Unsigned32.
      *  sipEntityType object added to sipCommonCfgTable.
      *  All accessible-for-notify objects are moved into
         sipCommonNotifObjects group.  OIDs for actual notifications are
         re-assigned as a result.
      *  sipNotifSequenceNumber accessible-for-notify object added as a
         way for managers to gain insight into possible missed
         notifications.  It is bound to each notification defined in the
         MIB.
      *  New notifications related to SIP service operational status are
         added: sipServiceColdStart, sipServiceWarmStart, and
         sipServiceLastChanged.
      *  New object sipServiceNotifEnable added to control the new SIP
         related notifications.
      *  Minor object descriptor changes: sipStatusCodesTable renamed to
         sipStatusCodeClassesTable SipStatusCodesEntry renamed to
         SipStatusCodeClassesEntry sipStatusCodesEntry renamed to
         sipStatusCodeClassesEntry sipCommonStatusCodeTable renamed to

      *  Clarifying words added to sipStatusCodeNotifTable DESCRIPTION
         to explain why it's a separate table from sipStatusCodesTable.
   o  SIP-SERVER-MIB
      *  Deleted objects related to 'action' parameter.  RFC 3261
         section 10.2 deprecates the 'action' parameter deleted 3
         objects: sipServerContactDfltAction, sipServerRespectUAAction,
         sipContactAction.
      *  Deleted pgp-related objects.  RFC 3261 section 23 deprecates
         use of pgp deleted 3 objects: sipProxyAuthPgpAlgorithm,
         sipPgpPrivateKey, sipPgpVersion.
      *  Removed sipProxyStateTimeout object.  Timers G and timer H have
         been introduced in RFC 3261 for this purpose (see RFC 3261
         section 17.2.1).
      *  Updated description clause of sipProxyStatefulness.  The 3
         definitions of stateless/statefulness now match the text in RFC
         3261.
      *  Changed DEFVAL for object sipProxyProvideAlternatives.  Changed
         DEFVAL to true to align with RFC 3261 that states that 485
         responses SHOULD contain a contact header and 303 MAY... and
         updated REFERENCE clause to "RFC 3261 Sections 13.2.2.2 and
         16.5".
      *  Removed basic authentication value from sipProxyAuthMethod
         object Per section 22 of RFC 3261, deprecated.
      *  Changed SYNTAX of sipProxyNonceLifeTime from Integer32 to
         Unsigned32.
      *  Updated description clause of sipRegDfltRegActiveInterval Per
         RFC 3261 Section 10.2.
   o  SIP-UA-MIB
      *  OBJECT refinement for sipUACfgSipServerStatus added to
         compliance.
      *  Changed the object descriptors of sipUACfgSipServerAddrIndex to
         sipUACfgSipServerIndex, and sipUACfgSipServerAddrStatus to
         sipUACfgSipServerStatus.

      *  sipCommonCfgExpires OID subtree added.  Per method Expires
         configuration objects were added there.  This new high-level
         OID was placed under the existing sipCommonCfgRetry OID and
         therefore, caused the OIDs for the subsequent groups to change
         (incrementing by one).
      *  Objects from tables under sipCommonCfgExpires were added to a
         new OBJECT-GROUP sipCommonConfigExpiresGroup, and that group
         was listed as optional in sipCommonCompliance.
      *  Minor DESCRIPTION change for sipCommonCfgEntry.  No behavior
         change.
      *  sipServiceOperStatus SYNTAX changed.  New values added:
         congested and quiescing Old values removed: halted The order of
         the enumeration was altered as well.
      *  sipServiceAdminStatus SYNTAX changed.  New values added: noop,
         up, down, quieseSessions, and quieseApplications Old values
         removed: shutdown, restart, stop, rts.  These changes were made
         based on comments from last call reviewer and general known
         ambiguities in the previous design of the object.
      *  Clarifying changes to the DESCRIPTION of sipServiceStartTime.
      *  Clarifying changes to the DESCRIPTION of sipServiceStartTime.
      *  Clarification of behavior for sipPortStatus while row is
         'active'
      *  Clarifying changes to the DESCRIPTION of sipUriSupportedTable.
      *  Clarifying changes to the DESCRIPTIONs of sipFtrSupportedTable,
         sipFtrSupportedEntry, and sipFtrSupported.  Specifically, IETF
         standard features and non-standard features are now represented
         by this table.  Only non-standard features were mentioned in
         prior revisions of the draft.
      *  Reference to usage of RFC 2788 applIndex moved from
         sipCommonCfgTimerExtMethodTable to
         sipCommonCfgTimerExtMethodEntry.  This was the convention for
         other table/entry definitions in the MIB, so these objects were
         previously unconventional.
      *  DEFVAL removed from sipCfgTimerExtMethodTimer.  The generic
         nature of the "extension" object does not lend itself to being
         able to specify a particular default value.

      *  Since the removal of the DEFVAL clause from
         sipCfgTimerExtMethodTimer, a value for that object must be
         specified when creating a sipCommonCfgTimerExtMethodEntry.  The
         description of sipCfgTimerExtMethodStatus was updated to
         reflect this.
      *  sipCommonCfgRetryExtMethodTable is now properly defined under
         sipCommonCfgRetry OID space instead of under sipCommonCfgTimer
         OID space.
      *  DEFVAL removed from sipCfgRetryExtMethodRetry.  The generic
         nature of the "extension" object does not lend itself to being
         able to specify a particular default value.
      *  Since the removal of the DEFVAL clause from
         sipCfgRetryExtMethodRetry, a value for that object must be
         specified when creating a sipCommonCfgRetryExtMethodEntry.  The
         description of sipCfgRetryExtMethodStatus was updated to
         reflect this.
      *  Clarifying changes to the DESCRIPTION of
         sipSummaryTotalTransactions.  Specifically, the object is not
         applicable to stateless SIP proxy servers and the object should
         always return a value of 0 if implemented by a stateless proxy.
      *  Clarifying changes to the DESCRIPTION of
         sipStatsExtMethodStatus.
      *  sipStatsOtherClassesIns and sipStatsOtherClassesOuts counter
         objects were added to sipStatusCodesTable to handle possible
         future classes of response status codes.
      *  Text referring specifically to Redirect Server in
         sipStatsRedirClassIns and sipStatsRedirClassOuts was removed.
      *  Text defining protocol behavior in sipStatsServerFailClassIns,
         sipStatsServerFailClassOuts, sipStatsGlobalFailClassIns, and
         sipStatsGlobalFailClassOuts was removed.
      *  sipCommonStatusCodeNotifInterval SYNTAX changed from TimeTicks
         to Unsigned32 w/ a UNITS of "seconds" added to the definition.
         DEFVAL clause changed accordingly.
      *  sipStatusCodeNotifTo, sipStatusCodeNotifFrom,
         sipStatusCodeNotifCallId, and sipStatusCodeNotifCSeq all had
         clarifying changes to their DESCRIPTIONs.  Specifically, the
         header name will be part of the object value and example values
         were given.
      *  Clarifying changes to the DESCRIPTION of sipCurrentTransTable
         and sipTransactionTable.  Specifically, these tables are not
         applicable to transaction stateless SIP Proxy Servers.
      *  Minor grammatical change to the DESCRIPTION of
         sipCurrentTransEntry.
      *  sipTransMethod and sipTransActivityInfo objects were added to
         sipTransactionTable while sipTransCallingPartyContentType and
         sipTransCalledPartyContentType were removed.

      *  Clarifying changes to the DESCRIPTION of sipTransState.
         Specifically, noting that not all values of the object are
         applicable to all transaction types.
      *  sipTransTo, sipTransFrom, sipTransCallId, and sipTransCSeq all
         had clarifying changes to their DESCRIPTIONs.  Specifically,
         the header name will be part of the object value and example
         values were given.
      *  Minor grammatical change to the DESCRIPTION of
         sipOtherStatsEntry.
      *  sipCommonStatusCodeIns and sipCommonStatusCodeOuts objects were
         added to the varbind of sipStatusCodeNotif.
      *  Appropriate changes were made to sipCommonStatsGroup OBJECT-
         GROUP based on objects being added and/or removed from the MIB.
   o  SIP-SERVER-MIB
      *  CONTACT-INFO "SIP MIB email" changed to sip@ietf.org
      *  The statement "Unlike a Proxy server it does not initiate
         requests." was removed from where a Redirect Server is defined
         in the MIB's DESCRIPTION.
      *  sipServerMIBNotifs OID removed.  No notifications were ever
         defined under this subtree.
      *  Clarifying text added to all of the Table DESCRIPTIONS stating

         value of applIndex used in the SIP-COMMON-MIB.
      *  Clarifying changes to the DESCRIPTION of sipProxyStatefulness.
      *  sipContactPreference SYNTAX changed from OCTET STRING to
         SnmpAdminString.

         under this subtree.
      *  Clarifying text added to all of the Table DESCRIPTIONS stating
         that the value of applIndex used in this MIB corresponds to the
         value of applIndex used in the SIP-COMMON-MIB.
   o  SIP-TC
      *  CONTACT-INFO "SIP MIB email" changed to sip@ietf.org

   Changes from draft-ietf-sip-mib-02
   o  General
      *  Eliminated the SIP-MIB-SMI modules.  Each MIB module will now
         get it's own IANA OID.
      *  Top-level OID subtrees restructured in each MIB.
      *  General cleanup/removal of "placeholder" OID subtrees for
         object groups and notifications that never materialized.
   o  SIP-COMMON-MIB

      *  Removed sipStatsRetryAcks.
      *  sipCommonStatsRetryExtMethodEntry was missing its INDEX clause.
