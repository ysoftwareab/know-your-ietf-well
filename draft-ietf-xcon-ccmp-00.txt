Abstract

   The Centralized Conferencing Manipulation Protocol (CCMP) defined in
   this document provides the mechanisms to create, change and delete
   objects related to centralized conferences, including participants,
   their media and their roles.  The protocol relies on web services as
   its infrastructure, but can control conferences that use any
   signaling protocol to invite users.  CCMP is based on the Simple
   Object Access Protocol (SOAP), with the data necessary for the

1.  Introduction

   The Framework for Centralized Conferencing (XCON)
   [I-D.ietf-xcon-framework]defines a signaling-agnostic framework,
   naming conventions and logical entities required for constructing
   advanced conferencing systems.  A primary concept introduced in the
   XCON framework is the existence of a conference object.  The
   framework introduces the conference object as a logical
   representation of a conference instance which represents the current
   state and capabilities of a conference.

   The Centralized Conferencing Manipulation Protocol (CCMP) defined in
   this document allows the creation, manipulation and deletion of a
   conference object by authenticated and authorized clients.  This
   includes adding and removing participants, changing their roles, as
   well as adding and removing media streams and associated end points.

   CCMP implements a client-server model.  The server is the Conference
   Control Server defined in the XCON framework.  The client is the
   Conference and Media Control Client in the XCON framework.  This
   document describes the protocol used by the client for conference
   control.

   CCMP manipulates conferences based on their semantic properties and
   is based on a client-server Remote Procedure Call (RPC) mechanism,
   with the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)
   [W3C.REC-soap12-part1-20030624] and [W3C.REC-soap12-part2-20030624]
   used to carry out the appropriate client-server protocol
   transactions.

   The common information contained in conference objects is defined
   using an XML representation based on the schema in the XCON data
   model [I-D.ietf-xcon-common-data-model].  These data structures are
   used as the basis for the Web Services Description Language (WSDL)
   [W3C.CR-wsdl20-20051215] definition and XML schema.

   This document first provides some background on the motivations
   associated with the design of CCMP in Section 4 followed by a brief
   discussion of the system architecture in Section 5.

   A discussion of the primary keys in the conference object carried in
   the protocol is detailed in Section 6.  An overview of the operations
   associated with each protocol request and response is provided in
   Section 7, with the practical sequence of protocol requests and
   responses discussed in Section 8 and examples provided in Section 10.
   The protocol parameters are detailed in Section 9.

   The transaction model is described in Section 11.  The XML schema is

   provided in Section 12 and the corresponding WSDL information is
   detailed in Section 13.


2.  Conventions

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and indicate requirement
   levels for compliant implementations.


3.  Terminology

   This document reuses the terminology defined in the Framework for
   Centralized Conferencing [I-D.ietf-xcon-framework].  In addition, the
   following acronyms and terms are used in this document:

   SOAP:  Simple Object Access Protocol[W3C.REC-soap12-part1-20030624][W
      3C.REC-soap12-part2-20030624].
   WSDL:  Web Services Description Language[W3C.CR-wsdl20-20051215].
      WSDL is an XML format for describing network services as a set of
      endpoints operating on messages containing either document-
      oriented or procedure-oriented information.
   W3C:  World Wide Web Consortium.  The organization that developed the
      SOAP and WSDL specifications referenced within this document.


4.  Motivation

   SOAP is chosen as the RPC mechanism due to its compatibility with the
   requirements for the conference control protocol as introduced in the
   framework for centralized conferencing.  SOAP is a lightweight
   protocol for exchange of information in a decentralized, distributed
   environment.  It is an XML-based protocol that consists of three
   parts: an envelope that defines a framework for describing what is in
   a message to process it, a set of encoding rules for expressing
   instances of application-defined datatypes, and a convention for
   representing remote procedure calls and responses.  SOAP allows the
   re-use of libraries, servers and other infrastructure and provides a
   convenient mechanism for the formal definition of protocol syntax
   using Web Services Description Language (WSDL).

   WSDL is an XML format for describing network services as a set of
   endpoints operating on messages containing either document-oriented
   or procedure-oriented information.  The operations and messages are
   described abstractly, and then bound to a concrete network protocol



Barnes, et al.          Expires December 18, 2008               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                    CCMP                         June 2008


   and message format to define an endpoint.  Related concrete endpoints
   are combined into abstract endpoints (services).  WSDL is extensible
   to allow description of endpoints and their messages regardless of
   what message formats or network protocols are used to communicate,
   however, the only bindings included in this document describe how to
   use WSDL in conjunction with SOAP.

   It is likely that implementations and future standardization work
   will add more conference attributes and parameters.  There are three
   types of extensions.  The first and simplest type of extension adds
   elements to the overall conference description, media descriptions or
   descriptions of users.  The XML namespace mechanism makes such
   extensions relatively easy, although implementations still have to
   deal with implementations that may not understand the new namespaces.
   The Options operation (Section 8.2.1) allows clients to determine the
   capabilities of a specific server, reflected by the specific
   blueprints supported by that server.

   A second type of extension replaces the conference, user or media
   objects with completely new schema definitions, i.e., the namespaces
   for these objects themselves differ from the basic one defined in
   this document.  As long as the Options request remains available and
   keeps to a mutually-understood definition, a compatible client and
   server will be able to bootstrap themselves into using these new
   objects.

   Finally, it is conceivable that new object types are needed beyond
   the core conference, user and media objects and their children.
   These would also be introduced by namespaces.


5.  System Architecture

   CCMP supports the framework for centralized conferencing.  Figure 1
   depicts a subset of the 'Conferencing System Logical Decomposition'
   architecture from the framework for centralized conferencing
   document.  It illustrates the role that CCMP assumes within the
   overall centralized architecture.

   CCMP serves as the Conference Control Protocol, allowing the
   conference control client to interface with the conference object
   maintained by the conferencing system, as represented in Figure 1.
   Conference Control is one part of functionality for advanced
   conferencing supported by a conferencing client.  Other functions are

6.  Conference Object and User Identifiers

   This section provides an overview of the conference object and
   conference users which are key protocol elements for creating the
   CCMP requests and responses.  The identifiers used in CCMP for the
   conference object (XCON-URI) and conference user (XCON-USERID) are
   introduced in the XCON framework and defined in the XCON data model
   [I-D.ietf-xcon-common-data-model].

6.1.  Conference Object

   Conference objects feature a simple dynamic inheritance-and-override
   mechanism.  Conference objects are linked into a tree, where each
   tree node inherits attributes from its parent node.  The roots of
   these inheritance trees are also known as "blueprints".  Nodes in the
   inheritance tree can be active conferences or simply descriptions
   that do not currently have any resources associated with them.  An
   object can mark certain of its properties as unalterable, so that
   they cannot be overridden.

   The schema for the conference object is defined in the XCON data
   model.  Conference objects are uniquely identified by the XCON-URI.
   A client MAY specify a parent element that indicates the parent from
   which the conference is to inherit values.  When creating
   conferences, the XCON-URI included by the client is only a
   suggestion.  To avoid identifier collisions and to conform to local
   server policy, the conference control server MAY choose a different
   identifier.

6.2.  Conference Users and Participants

   Each conference can have zero or more users.  All conference
   participants are users, but some users may have only administrative
   functions and do not contribute or receive media.  Users are added
   one user at a time to simplify error reporting.  Users are inherited
   as well, so that it is easy to set up a conference that has the same
   set of participants or a common administrator.  The Conference
   Control Server creates individual users, assigning them a unique
   Conference User Identifier (XCON-USERID).

   A variety of elements defined in the common <conference-info> element
   as specified in the XCON data model are used to determine how a
   specific user expects and is allowed to join a conference as a
   participant, or users with specific privileges (e.g., observer).  For
   example, the <method> attribute defines how the caller joins the

   conference, with a set of defined XML elements, namely <dial-in> for
   users that are allowed to dial in and <dial-out> for users that the
   conference focus will be trying to reach. <dial-in> is the default.

   If the conference is currently active, dial-out users are contacted
   immediately; otherwise, they are contacted at the start of the
   conference.  The conference control server assigns a unique
   Conference User Identifier (XCON-USERID) to each user.  The
   conference control server uses the XCON-USERID to change or delete
   <user> elements.  Depending upon policies and privileges, specific
   users MAY also manipulate <user> elements.

   In many conferences, users can dial in if they know the XCON-URI and
   an access code shared by all conference participants.  In this case,
   the system is typically not be aware of the call signaling URL.
   Thus, the initial <user> element does not have an entity attribute
   and the default type of <dial-in> is used to support this type of
   user.  For this case, the server assigns a locally-unique URI, such
   as a locally-scoped tel URI.  The conference control server assigns a
   unique Conference User Identifier (XCON-USERID) to these users when
   they dial-in to join the conference.  If the user supports the
   notification event package [I-D.ietf-xcon-event-package], they can
   receive their XCON-USERID, thus allowing them to also manipulate the
   <user> attribute, including the entity attribute, in the conference
   object.


7.  Protocol Operations

   The primary function of the protocol defined within this document is
   to provide a conference control client with the ability to carry out
   operations on a conference object as a whole and on specific elements
   within a conference object.  This section describes the four basic
   operations on a conference object: retrieve, create, change and
   delete.  The XCON-URI as discussed in Section 6.1 is the target for
   each of these operations.  The normative protocol details as to the
   applicability of each of the operations for the various CCMP requests
   and responses are provided in Section 8

7.1.  Retrieve

   The "retrieve" operation is used by a client to query a system for a
   specific template in the form of a blueprint prior to the creation of
   a conference.  In this case, the "retrieve" operation often follows
   an "options" operation, although a conferencing control client may be
   pre-configured to perform the "retrieve" operation on a specific
   blueprint.




Barnes, et al.          Expires December 18, 2008               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                    CCMP                         June 2008


   The "retrieve" operation is also used to get the current
   representation of a specific conference object (or specific
   parameters in the conference object) for a conference reservation or
   an active conference.  The unique conference identifier (XCON-URI) is
   included in the CCMP request.

   The "retrieve" operation returns the XML document describing the
   conference object in its current state including all inherited values
   or the specific parameters per the specific request type.  Elements
   may be marked by attributes, in particular, whether they are specific
   to this instance or have been inherited from the parent node.

   To simplify operations, HTTP GET can also be used directly on XCON-
   URIs, so that simple systems that need to only obtain data about
   conference objects do not need a full SOAP implementation.

7.2.  Create

   The "create" operation is used by a client to create and reserve a
   conference object or a new conference user.  The creation of a
   conference object can be explicit by requesting it to be created
   based upon a specific blueprint, based on an existing conference
   object (e.g., cloning a conference reservation or active conference
   object) or based on the data included in the request.  In the first
   two cases, a specific XCON-URI MUST be included in the request.

   When the creation of a conference object is implicit, with no
   conference object for a blueprint or existing conference specified
   and no data included in the request, the creation and reservation of
   the conference instance is based on the default conference object.
   The default conference object is specific to a conference control
   server and its specification is outside the scope of this document.

   A client may first send a requeest with "retrieve" operation in order
   to obtain all the data as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-xcon-common-data-model] for the specific blueprint or
   existing conference object.  This would allow the client to modify
   the data prior to sending the request with the "create" operation.
   In this case, the request would also include all the data.  If the
   client wants to create the new conference by cloning the blueprint or
   existing conference object, there would be no data included in the
   request.  The client may later modify this data by sending a request
   with a "change" operation.

   When creating conferences, any XCON-URI included by the client is
   considered as the target conference object from which the new
   conference is to be created.  To avoid identifier collisions and to
   conform to local server policy, the conference control server



Barnes, et al.          Expires December 18, 2008              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft                    CCMP                         June 2008


   typically chooses a different identifier for the newly created
   conference object.  The identifier is returned in the response.

   In addition, the conference description MAY contain a calendar
   element, in the iCal format in XML rendition defined in CPL [RFC3880]
   or (preferable, if available as stable reference) xCal
   [I-D.royer-calsch-xcal].  This description indicates when the
   conference is active.

   The "create" operation may also be used to create a new conference
   user with the "userRequest" message.  In this case, the
   "userResponse" to this operation includes an XCON-USERID.

   To simplify operations, HTTP PUT can also be used to create a new
   object as idenfied by the XCON-URI or XCON-USERID.

7.3.  Change

   The "change" operation updates the conference object as referenced by
   the XCON-URI included in the request.  A request which attempts to
   change a non-existing object is an error, as is a request which
   attempts to change a parameter that is inherited from a protected
   element.

   During the lifetime of a conference, this operation is used by a
   conference control client to manipulate a conference object.  This
   includes the ability to manipulate specific elements in the
   conference object through element specific requests such as
   "userRequest" or "sideBarRequest", etc.

   Upon receipt of a "change" operation, the conference control server
   updates the specific elements in the referenced conference object.
   Object properties that are not explicitly changed, remain as-is.
   This approach allows a conference control client to manipulate
   objects created by another application even if the manipulating
   application does not understand all object properties.

   To simplify operations, HTTP POST can also be used to change the
   conference object identified by the XCON-URI.

7.4.  Delete

   This conference control operation is used to delete the current
   representation of a conference object or a specific parameter in the
   conference object and requires the unique conference identifier
   (XCON-URI) be provided by the client.

   A request which attempts to delete a conference object that is being



Barnes, et al.          Expires December 18, 2008              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                    CCMP                         June 2008


   referenced by a child object is an error.

   To simplify operations, HTTP DELETE can also be used to delete
   conference objects and parameters within conference objects
   identified by the XCON-URI.


8.  Protocol Operations on Conference Objects

   The primary function of CCMP is to provide a conference control
   client with the ability to carry out specific operations (Section 7)
   on a conference object through the protocol requests and responses.
   The CCMP requests (Section 8.2)and responses (Section 8.3) are
   enveloped in SOAP requests and responses.  The basic request/response
   pairs defined in this document are:

   optionsRequest/optionsResponse:  The optionsRequest is used to
      ascertain the namespaces, conference reservations and active
      conferences supported by the server.  The optionsResponse returns
      a list of the requested types of conference objects (e.g.,
      Blueprints, Conference Reservations and/or Active Confrences)
      supported by the specific conference server.
   confRequest/confResponse:  The confRequest is used to request an
      operation on the conference object as a whole.
   userRequest/userResponse:  The userRequest is used to request an
      operation on the "user" element in the conference object.
      [Editor's Note: we may want to add more discrete user requests/
      responses as this is a very broad parameter]
   usersRequest/usersResponse:  This usersRequest is used to manipulate
      the "users" element in the conference object, including parameters
      such as the allowed-users-list, join-handling, etc.
   sidebarRequest/sidebarResponse:  This sidebarRequest is used to
      retrieve the information related to a sidebar or to create, change
      or delete a specific sidebar.  [Editor's Note: the data model
      defines a byVal and byRef sidebar type.  Rather than define two
      root operations, the preference is to have these two types
      reflected by a parameter in the request.]

   [Editor's Note: more core requests/responses will be added to this
   document once the WG agrees the basic protocol structure.]

   To simplify operations, a conference control server treats certain
   parameters as suggestions (e.g., for the "create" and "change"
   operations), as noted in the object description.  If the conference
   control server cannot set the parameter to the values desired, it
   picks the next best value, according to local policy and returns the
   values selected in the response.  If the client is not satisfied with
   these values, it simply deletes the object.



Barnes, et al.          Expires December 18, 2008              [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                    CCMP                         June 2008


   Along with the protocol requests and responses for manipulating the
   conference object, there is also a querying mechanism
   ("optionsRequest"/"optionsResponse") to ascertain the namespaces
   understood by the server.  Any elements with namespaces not
   understood by the server are to be ignored by the server.  This
   allows a client to include optional elements in requests without
   having to tailor its request to the capabilities of each server.

   A conference control client and conference control server MUST fully
   implement the SOAP WSDL schema defined in Section 13 which uses HTTP
   operations as the transport mechanism in this specification.
   Extensions MAY choose to use alternate transport mechanisms in
   association with the SOAP WSDL.

   A conference client must first discover the conference control server
   as described in Section 8.1.  The conference control server is the
   recipient of the CCMP requests.

8.1.  Locating a Conference Control Server

   If a conference control client is not pre-configured to use a
   specific conference control server for the requests, the client MUST
   first discover the conference control server before it can send any
   requests.

   There are several options for discovery of the conference control
   server.

   [Editor's note: need to add more detail in this section!]

8.2.  Constructing a CCMP Request

   The construction of the SOAP envelope associated with a CCMP request
   message complies fully with the WSDL, as defined in Section 13.
   Construction of a valid CCMP request is based upon the operations
   defined in Section 7, depending upon the function and associated
   information desired by the conference control client.  The following
   sections provide details of the "optionsRequest" message and
   summarize the CCMP requests related to the specific operations in
   Section 7.

8.2.1.  Options Request

   The "optionsRequest" is used by a client to query a system for its
   capabilities in terms of types of conferences supported and isn't
   targeted toward a particular conference object.  The "optionsRequest
   is also used by a client with appropriate authority to query a system
   for a list of the conference reservations and active conferences that

   have been created on the specific conferencing system.

   The "optionsResponse" returns the XML namespaces that the server
   understands and the namespaces to be used in responses that it
   requires the client to understand.  Within the conferencing system,
   the namespaces correlate with blueprints, as specified in the XCON
   framework.  The blueprints are comprised of conference information
   initialized to specific values and ranges.  Each blueprint has a
   corresponding XCON-URI.

8.2.2.  Operations Requests

   Construction of other valid CCMP requests is based upon the
   operations defined in Section 7, depending upon the function and
   associated information desired by the conference control client.  The
   following table summarizes specific request type and processing for
   each of the "operations".  A value of "N/A" indicates the specific
   operation is not valid for the specific CCMP request.

            Table 1: Request Type Operation Specific Processing

8.3.  Handling a CCMP Response

   As with the CCMP request message, the CCMP response message is
   enclosed in a SOAP envelope.  A response to the CCMP request MUST
   contain a response code and may contain other elements depending upon
   the specific request and the value of the response code.

   All response codes are application-level, and MUST only be provided
   in successfully processed transport-level responses.  For example
   where HTTP is used, CCMP Response messages MUST be accompanied by a
   200 OK HTTP response.

   The set of CCMP Response codes currently contain the following
   tokens:

   success:  This code indicates that the request was successfully
      processed.
   modified:  This code indicates that the object was created, but may
      differ from the request.
   badRequest:  This code indicates that the request was badly formed in
      some fashion.
   unauthorized:  This code indicates that the user was not authorized
      for the specific operation on the conference object.
   forbidden:  This code indicates that the specific operation is not
      valid for the target conference object.
   objectNotFound:  This code indicates that the specific conference
      object was not found.
   operationNotAllowed:  This code indicates that the specific operation
      is not allowed for the target conference object (e.g.., due to
      policies, etc.)
   deleteFailedParent:  This code indicates that the conferencing system
      cannot delete the specific conference object because it is a
      parent for another conference object.
   changeFailedProtected:  This code indicates that the target
      conference object cannot be changed (e.g., due to policies, roles,
      privileges, etc.).
   requestTimeout:  This code indicates that the request could not be
      processed within a reasonable time, with the time specific to a
      conferencing system implementation.
   serverInternalError:  This code indicates that the conferencing
      system experienced some sort of internal error.
   notImplemented:  This code indicates that the specific operation is
      not implemented on that conferencing system.

   CCMP Response codes are defined to allow for extensibility.  A
   conference control client SHOULD treat unrecognized response codes as



Barnes, et al.          Expires December 18, 2008              [Page 15]

Internet-Draft                    CCMP                         June 2008


   it handles a Response code of "notImplemented".

8.3.1.  Options Response

   An "optionsResponse" message containing a response code of "success"
   MUST include the XML namespaces that the server understands and the
   namespaces to be used in subsequent responses that it requires the
   client to understand.  Future work may add more global capabilities
   rather than conferencing system specific.  Within the conferencing
   system, the namespaces correlate with blueprints, as specified in the
   XCON framework.  The blueprints are comprised of conference
   information initialized to specific values and ranges.

   Upon receipt of a successful "optionsResponse" message, a conference
   control client may then initiate a "confRequest" with a "retrieve"
   operation per Section 7.1 to get a specific conference blueprint.

   In the case of a response code of "requestTimeout", a conference
   control client MAY re-attempt the request within a period of time
   that would be specific to a conference control client or conference
   control server.

   The response codes of "modified", "deleteParentFailed" and
   "changeFailedProtected" are not applicable to an "optionsRequest" and
   should be treated as "serverInternalError", the handling of which is
   specific to the conference control client.

   An "optionsResponse" message containing any other response code is an
   error and the handling is specific to the conference control client.
   Typically, an error for an "optionsRequest" indicates a configuration
   problem in the conference control server or in the client.

8.3.2.  Operation Responses

   The following sections detail the operation specific handling of the
   response codes, including details associated with specific types of
   responses in the cases where the response handling is not generic.

8.3.2.1.  Retrieve Operation Responses

   A confResponse for a "retrieve" operation containing a response code
   of "success" MUST contain the full XML document describing the
   conference object in its current state including all inherited
   values.  Elements may be marked by attributes, in particular, whether
   they are specific to this instance or have been inherited from the
   parent node.

   Any other CCMP response message (e.g., userResponse, usersResponse,



Barnes, et al.          Expires December 18, 2008              [Page 16]

Internet-Draft                    CCMP                         June 2008


   etc.) for a "retrieve" operation containing a response code of
   "success" MUST contain the XML document describing the specific
   target parameter (as indicated by the specific type of Request) from
   the conference object.

   If a response code of "objectNotFound" is received in a
   "confResponse" message to a "confRequest" to get the initial
   blueprint, it is RECOMMENDED that a conference control client attempt
   to retrieve another conference blueprint if more than one had been
   received in the "optionsResponse" message.  If there was only one
   blueprint in the "optionsResponse" initially, then the client should
   send another "optionsRequest" message to determine if there may be
   new or additional blueprints for the specific conferencing system.
   If this "optionsResponse" message contains no blueprints, the
   handling is specific to the conference control client.  If the client
   was retrieving an existing conference object that had been returned
   in a previous "optionsRequest", the "objectNotFound" could reflect a
   conference object that has been deleted by another user.  In this
   case, the client should consider another "optionsRequest" message to
   obtain an up-to-date list of conference objects.

   If a response code of "requestTimeout" is received in the CCMP
   response, a conference control client MAY re-attempt the request
   within a period of time that would be specific to a conference
   control client or conference control server.

   Response codes such as "notImplemented" and "forbidden" indicate that
   a subsequent "retrieve" would not likely be sucessful.  Handling of
   these and other response codes is specific to the conference control
   client.  For example, in the case of some clients an "options"
   operation might be performed again or another conference control
   server may be accessed.

   The response codes of "modified", "deleteParentFailed" and
   "changeFailedProtected" are not applicable to the "retrieve"
   operation and SHOULD be treated as "serverInternalError", the
   handling of which is specific to the conference control client.

8.3.2.2.  Create Operation Responses

   The only valid responses containing a "create" operation are a
   "confResponse" and the "userResponse".  If the CCMP response contains
   a response code of "success", a "confResponse" message MUST contain
   the XCON-URI for the conference object and a "userResponse" message
   MUST contain the XCON-USERID.

   If the confResponse to a "create" operation contains a response code
   of "modified", along with the XCON-URI for the conference object, the



Barnes, et al.          Expires December 18, 2008              [Page 17]

Internet-Draft                    CCMP                         June 2008


   response MUST also contain the entire XML document associated with
   that conference object for a "confRequest".  For example, in the case
   where the conference object contained a calendar element, the
   conference server may only offer a subset of the dates requested,
   thus the updated dates are included in the returned XML document.

   In the case of a response code of "requestTimeout", a conference
   control client MAY re-attempt the request within a period of time
   that would be specific to a conference control client or conference
   control server.

   Response codes such as "unauthorized", "forbidden" and
   "operationNotAllowed" indicate the client does not have the
   appropriate permissions, there is an error in the permissions, or
   there is a system error in the client or conference control server,
   thus re-attempting the request would likely not succeed.

   The response codes of "deleteParentFailed" and
   "changeFailedProtected" are not applicable to the "create" operation
   and SHOULD be treated as "serverInternalError", the handling of which
   is specific to the conference control client.

   Any other response code indicates an error in the client or
   conference control server (e.g., "forbidden", "badRequest") and the
   handling is specific to the conference control client.

8.3.2.3.  Change Operation Responses

   If the CCMP response to the "change" operation contains a response
   code of "success", the response SHOULD also contain the XCON-URI for
   the conference object that was changed.

   If the CCMP response to the "change" operation contains a response
   code of "modified", the response MUST contain the XCON-URI for the
   conference object and the appropriate XML document (either the full
   XML document for a confResponse or specific paramaters for the other
   CCMP request types) associated with that conference object.  For
   example, a conferencing system may not have the resources to support
   specific capabilities that were changed, such as <codecs> in the
   <available-media>, thus the <codecs> supported are included in the
   returned XML document.

   If the CCMP response code of "requestTimeout" is received, a
   conference control client MAY re-attempt the request within a period
   of time that would be specific to a conference control client or
   conference control server.

   Response codes such as "unauthorized", "forbidden",



Barnes, et al.          Expires December 18, 2008              [Page 18]

Internet-Draft                    CCMP                         June 2008


   "operationNotAllowed" and "changeFailedProtected" indicate the client
   does not have the appropriate permissions, the conference is locked,
   there is an error in the permissions, or there is a system error in
   the client or conference control server, thus re-attempting the
   request would likely not succeed.

   The response code of "deleteParentFailed" is not applicable to the
   "change" operation and SHOULD be treated as "serverInternalError",
   the handling of which is specific to the conference control client.

   Any other response code indicates an error in the client or
   conference control server (e.g., "forbidden", "badRequest") and the
   handling is specific to the conference control client.

8.3.2.4.  Delete Operation Responses

   If the CCMP response to the "delete" operation contains a response
   code of "success", the response MUST contain the XCON-URI for the
   conference object that was deleted for a "confResponse" or whose data
   element(s) were deleted for the other response types.

   The response code of "deleteParentFailed" indicates that the
   conference object could not be deleted because it is the Parent of
   another conference object that is in use.  In this case, the response
   also includes the XCON-URI for the conference object and is only
   applicable to a "confResponse".  If this response code is received
   for any other type of CCMP response, it should be treated as
   "serverInternalError", the handling of which is specific to the
   conference control client.

   If a response code of "requestTimeout" is received, a conference
   control client MAY re-attempt the request within a period of time
   that would be specific to a conference control client or conference
   control server.

   Response codes such as "unauthorized", "forbidden" and
   "operationNotAllowed" indicate the client does not have the
   appropriate permissions, the conference is locked, there is an error
   in the permissions, or there is a system error in the client or
   conference control server, thus re-attempting the request would
   likely not succeed.

   The response code of "changeFailedProtected" is not applicable to the
   "delete" operation and SHOULD be treated as "serverInternalError",
   the handling of which is specific to the conference control client.

   Any other response code indicates an error in the client or
   conference control server (e.g., "forbidden", "badRequest") and the

   handling is specific to the conference control client.


9.  Protocol Parameters

   This section describes in detail the parameters that are used for the
   CCMP protocol.

9.1.  Operation Parameter

   The "operation" attribute is a mandatory token included in all CCMP
   request and response messages except the "optionsRequest" and
   "optionsResponse".  This document defines four possible values for
   this parameter: "retrieve", "create", "change" and "delete".

9.2.  Request ID Parameter

   The "requestID" attribute is a mandatory token included in all CCMP
   request and response messages.  The "requestID" is used to correlate
   the requests with the appropriate response.

9.3.  ConfObjID Parameter

   The "confObjID" attribute is an optional URI included in the CCMP
   request and response messages.  This attribute is required in the
   case of an "operation" of "retrieve", "change", and "delete" in the
   CCMP request and response messages.  The attribute is optional for an
   "operation" of "create" in the "confRequest" message.  The "create"
   cases for which this parameter is REQUIRED are described in
   Section 7.2.  This attribute is the XCON-URI which is the target for
   the specific operation.  [Editor's Note: it might be good to re-
   iterate the normative text here.]

   This attribute is not included in the "userRequest" message for an
   operation of "create".  In this case, the conference control client
   is requesting the creation of a new conference user, as detailed in
   Section 9.4.

   In the cases where the "conference-info" parameter Section 9.7 is
   also included in the requests and responses, the "confObjID" MUST
   match the XCON-URI in the "entity" attribute.

9.4.  ConfUserID Parameter

   The "confUserID" attribute is optional URI included in the CCMP
   request and response messages.  This is the XCON-USERID for the
   conference control client initiating the request.  The attribute is
   required in the CCMP request and response messages with the exception

Internet-Draft                    CCMP                         June 2008


   of the "userRequest" message.  The "confUserID" parameter is used to
   determine if the conference control client has the authority to
   perform the operation.  Note that the details for authorization and
   related policy are specified in a separate document [TBD].

   This attribute is optional only for an "userRequest" message with a
   "create" operation.  In this case, the request MUST include
   information about the user in the "user" element.  At a minimum, the
   request MUST include the "user" element with an "entity" attribute.
   For this case, the conference control server MUST create a new
   conference user and return the associated confUserID in the response,
   if the allocation of a new XCON-USERID is succesful.

   In the case where there is a confUserID in the request that has
   already been allocated, this request may be the creation of a
   confUserID for the conference control client to take on an additional
   role.

   This attribute is required in the "userResponse" message in the case
   of an "operation" of "create" and for all other responses.

9.5.  ResponseCode Parameter

   The "responseCode" attribute is a mandatory parameter in all CCMP
   response messages.  The values for each of the "responseCode" values
   are detailed in Section 8.3 with the associated processing described
   in Section 8.3.2.

9.6.  Blueprints Parameter

   The "blueprints" attribute is an optional parameter in the CCMP
   optionsResponse and confRequest messages.

   In the case of an "optionsRequest" message, the "optionsResponse"
   message with a "responseCode" of "success" SHOULD include the
   "blueprints" supported by the conference control server.  The
   "blueprints" attribute is comprised of a list of blueprints supported
   by the specific conference server and includes a conference system
   specific "blueprintName" and a "confObjID" in the form of an XCON-URI
   for each of the blueprints.

   The "blueprints" attribute is optional for a confRequest with an
   operation of "retrieve".

9.7.  Conference-info Parameter

   The "conference-info" element is optional in the CCMP confRequest and
   confResponse messages.

Internet-Draft                    CCMP                         June 2008


   The "conference-info" element contains the data for the conference
   object that is the target for the "confRequest" operations for
   "create", "change" and "delete" operations.  It is returned in a
   "confResponse" if the "confResponse" contains a responseCode of
   "modified" or if the original CCMP request for the "create" operation
   did not contain a "conference-info" element.  The latter case occurs
   when a conference control client sends a "confRequest" containing any
   of the following: - a "confObjID" associated with a specific
   blueprint - a "confObjID associated with a specific active conference
   or conference reservation that was included in an "optionsResponse"
   message - no "confObjID" (or "conference-info") element, in which
   case the request is to create a conference object based on a default
   provided by a conferencing system.

   The details on the information that may be included in the
   "conference-info" element MUST follow the rules as specified in the
   XCON Data Model document [I-D.ietf-xcon-common-data-model].  The
   conference control client and conference control server MUST follow
   those rules in generating the "conference-info" in any of the CCMP
   request and response messages.

   Note that the "conference-info" element is not explicitly shown in
   the XML schema (Section 12) due to XML schema constraints.

9.8.  User Parameter

   The "user" element contains the data for the conference user that is
   the target for the CCMP request operations.  It is REQUIRED for all
   "userRequest" messages.

   The details on the information that may be included in the "user"
   element MUST follow the rules as specified in the XCON Data Model
   document [I-D.ietf-xcon-common-data-model].  The conference control
   client and conference control server MUST follow those rules in
   generating the "user" in any of the CCMP request and response
   messages.

   Note that the "user" element is not explicitly shown in the XML
   schema Section 12 due to XML schema constraints.

9.9.  Users Parameter

   The "users" element contains the data for the conference users that
   are the target for the CCMP request operations.  It is REQUIRED for
   all "usersRequest" messages.

   The details on the information that may be included in the "users"
   element MUST follow the rules as specified in the XCON Data Model

   document [I-D.ietf-xcon-common-data-model].  The conference control
   client and conference control server MUST follow those rules in
   generating the "users" in any of the CCMP request and response
   messages.

   Note that the "users" element is not explicitly shown in the XML
   schema Section 12 due to XML schema constraints.

9.10.  Sidebar Parameters

   The "sidebar" parameter contains the data for the sidebar that is the
   target for the CCMP request operations.  It is REQUIRED for all
   "sidebarRequest" messages.  There are two elements associated with a
   sidebar: "sidebar-by-val" and "sidebar-by-ref".  The elements relate
   to whether the data for the sidebar is in the same conference object
   for which it serves as a sidebar or whether a new conference object
   is created for the sidebar.

   The details on the information that may be included in the "sidebar-
   by-val" or "sidebar-by-ref" element MUST follow the rules as
   specified in the XCON Data Model document
   [I-D.ietf-xcon-common-data-model].  The conference control client and
   conference control server MUST follow those rules in generating the
   "sidebar-by-val" or "sidebar-by-ref" element in any of the CCMP
   request and response messages.

   Security considerations:  This content type is designed to carry
      protocol data related conference control.  Some of the data could
      be considered private and thus should be protected.
   Interoperability considerations:  This content type provides a basis
      for a protocol
   Published specification:  RFC XXXX [[NOTE TO IANA/RFC-EDITOR: Please
      replace XXXX with the RFC number for this specification.]]
   Applications which use this media type:  Centralized Conferencing
      control clients and servers.
   Additional Information:  Magic Number(s): (none)
      File extension(s): .xml
      Macintosh File Type Code(s): (none)
   Person & email address to contact for further information:  Mary
      Barnes <mary.barnes@nortel.com>
   Intended usage:  LIMITED USE
   Author/Change controller:  The IETF
   Other information:  This media type is a specialization of
      application/xml [RFC3023], and many of the considerations
      described there also apply to application/ccmp+xml.

14.4.  CCMP Protocol Registry

   This document requests that the IANA create a new registry for the
   CCMP protocol including an initial registry for operation types and
   response codes.

14.4.1.  CCMP Message Types

   The CCMP messages are described in Section 8 and defined in the XML
   schema in Section 12.  The following summarizes the requested
   registry:

   Related Registry:   CCMP Message Types Registry
   Defining RFC:  RFC XXXX [NOTE TO IANA/RFC-EDITOR: Please replace XXXX
      with the RFC number for this specification.]
   Registration/Assignment Procedures:  New CCMP message types are
      allocated on a specification required basis.
   Registrant Contact:  IETF, XCON working group, (xcon@ietf.org), Mary
      Barnes (mary.barnes@nortel.com).

   This section pre-registers the following initial CCMP message types:

   optionsRequest:  Used by a conference control client to query a
      conferencing system for its capabilities.

Internet-Draft                    CCMP                         June 2008


   optionsResponse:  The optionsResponse returns a list of Blueprints
      supported by the specific conference server.
   confRequest:  The confRequest is used to create a conference object
      and/or to request an operation on the conference object as a
      whole.
   confResponse:  The confResponse indicates the result of the operation
      on the conference object as a whole.
   userRequest:  The userRequest is used to request an operation on the
      "user" element in the conference object.
   userResponse:  The userResponse indicates the result of the requested
      operation on the "user" element in the conference object.
   usersRequest  This usersRequest is used to manipulate the "users"
      element in the conference object, including parameters such as the
      allowed-users-list, join-handling, etc.
   usersResponse:  This usersResponse indicates the result of the
      request to manipulate the "users" element in the conference
      object.
   sidebarRequest:  This sidebarRequest is used to retrieve the
      information related to a sidebar or to create, change or delete a
      specific sidebar.
   sidebarResponse:  This sidebarResponse indicates the result of the
      sidebarRequest.

14.4.2.  CCMP Response Codes

   The following summarizes the requested registry for CCMP Response
   codes:

   Related Registry:   CCMP Response Code Registry
   Defining RFC:  RFC XXXX [NOTE TO IANA/RFC-EDITOR: Please replace XXXX
      with the RFC number for this specification.]
   Registration/Assignment Procedures:  New response codes are allocated
      on a first-come/first-serve basis with specification required.
   Registrant Contact:  IETF, XCON working group, (xcon@ietf.org), Mary
      Barnes (mary.barnes@nortel.com).

   This section pre-registers the following thirteen initial response
   codes as described above in Section 8.3:

   success:  This code indicates that the request was successfully
      processed.
   modified:  This code indicates that the object was created, but may
      differ from the request.
   badRequest:  This code indicates that the request was badly formed in
      some fashion.

Internet-Draft                    CCMP                         June 2008


   unauthorized:  This code indicates that the user was not authorized
      for the specific operation on the conference object.
   forbidden:  This code indicates that the specific operation is not
      valid for the target conference object.
   objectNotFound:  This code indicates that the specific conference
      object was not found.
   operationNotAllowed:  This code indicates that the specific operation
      is not allowed for the target conference object (e.g.., due to
      policies, etc.)
   deleteFailedParent:  This code indicates that the conferencing system
      cannot delete the specific conference object because it is a
      parent for another conference object.
   changeFailedProtected:  This code indicates that the target
      conference object cannot be changed (e.g., due to policies, roles,
      privileges, etc.).
   requestTimeout:  This code indicates that the request could not be
      processed within a reasonable time, with the time specific to a
      conferencing system implementation.
   serverInternalError:  This code indicates that the conferencing
      system experienced some sort of internal error.
   notImplemented:  This code indicates that the specific operation is
      not implemented on that conferencing system.


15.  Security Considerations

   Access to conference control functionality needs to be tightly
   controlled to keep attackers from disrupting conferences, adding
   themselves to conferences or engaging in theft of services.
   Implementors need to deploy standard HTTP and SOAP authentication and
   authorization mechanisms.  Since conference information may contain
   secrets such as participant lists and dial-in codes, all conference
   control information SHOULD be carried over TLS (HTTPS).
