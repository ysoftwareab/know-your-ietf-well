Abstract 

This document describes an RTP payload format for transporting AC-3 
encoded audio data.  AC-3 is a high quality multichannel audio coding 
system used in ATSC HDTV, DVD, film, and other media.  The RTP payload 
format presented in this document provides mechanisms for interleaving 
redundant data, which can increase packet loss resilience.  An 
intelligent method for fragmenting AC-3 frames that exceed the maximum 
transfer unit (MTU) is also described.

0. Change Log for <draft-flaks-avt-rtp-ac3-03.txt>

This is the first draft submission with Todd Hager replacing Jason Flaks
as author. Most changes are editorial and are not detailed in this log.

The single technical change in this revision was made to the NDU field 
described in 2.1.1. Previously, the NDU was designated as the high 4 
bits of a byte with the low 4 bits marked as reserved.  Now the NDU is an 
8-bit number so that no bit shifting is required to process it.

Internet Draft      RTP Payload Format for AC-3 Streams     January 2003


1. Introduction 

AC-3 is a high quality audio codec designed to encode multiple channels 
of audio into a low bit-rate format.  AC-3 achieves its large 
compression ratios via encoding a multiplicity of channels as a single 
entity.  Dolby Digital, which is a branded version of AC-3, encodes up 
to 5.1 channels of audio.
 
AC-3 has been adopted as an audio compression scheme for many consumer 
and professional applications.  It is the mandatory codec for DVD-video,
ATSC digital terrestrial television, laser disc, and DVD-audio (as an 
optional multichannel audio format). AC-3 is also a common audio format 
for film. 
 
It is highly likely that people may wish to stream AC-3 data over IP 
networks.  Applications for streaming AC-3 range from video on demand to
multichannel Internet radio.  RTP provides a mechanism for stream 
synchronization and hence serves as the best transport solution for 
AC-3, which is a codec primarily used in audio for video applications. 
The RTP payload described in this document also provides a method of 
ensuring a continuous high quality AC-3 stream.
 
1.1 Overview of AC-3 
 
AC-3 can deliver up to 5.1 channels of audio at data rates approximately
equal to half of one PCM channel [2], [6], [7]. The ".1" refers to a 
band limited optional low-frequency enhancement channel. AC-3 was 
designed for signals sampled at rates of 32, 44.1, or 48 kHz. Data rates
can vary between 64 kbps and 640 kpbs depending the number of channels 
and desired quality.
 
AC-3 exploits psychoacoustic phenomena that reveal large amounts of 
inaudible information contained in a typical audio signal.  Substantial 
data reduction occurs via the removal of all inaudible information 
contained in an audio stream.  Source coding techniques are further used
to reduce the data used to code an audio signal.
 
Like most perceptual coders, AC-3 operates in the frequency domain.  A 
512-point TDAC transform is taken with 50% overlap, providing 256 new 
frequency samples.  Frequency samples are then converted to exponents 
and mantissas.  Exponents are differentially encoded.  Mantissas are 
allocated a varying number of bits depending on the audibility of the 
spectral component associated with it. Audibility is determined via a 
masking curve.  Bits for mantissas are allocated from a global bit pool.
 
1.2 AC-3 Bitstream 
 
AC-3 bitstreams are organized into synchronization frames.  Each AC-3 
sync frame contains a Sync Information (SI) field, a Bit Stream 
Information (BSI) field, and 6 audio blocks (AB) representing 256 PCM

samples for each channel.  The entire frame represents a time duration 
of 1536 PCM samples across all coded channels (32 msec @ 48kHz sample 
rate) [2]. Figure 1 shows the AC-3 frame format.

The Synchronization Information field contains information needed to 
acquire and maintain synchronization.  The Bit Stream Information field 
contains parameters that describe the coded audio service [2].  Each 
audio block also contains fields that determine the usage of block 
switching, dither, dynamic range control, coupling, and exponent 
strategy.  Figure 2 shows the format of an AC-3 audio block.

2. RTP AC-3 Payload Format 
 
According to [5] RTP payload formats should contain an integral number 
of application data units (ADUs). In the context of audio compression 
algorithms an ADU typically refers to a codec frame. In this case an ADU
shall be equivalent to an AC-3 sync frame.  Hence each RTP packet will 
contain an integral number of AC-3 frames unless the AC-3 frame size 
exceeds the maximum transfer unit (MTU) of the underlying network. 

If a large AC-3 frame requires fragmentation before transmission 
within an RTP packet, section 2.2 provides guidelines for creating 
partial frames.

To compensate for the possibility of lost packets, each RTP packet
may contain redundant audio information in addition to, or instead of, 
the primary AC-3 data payload. These redundant data may exactly 
replace lost audio data in response to a request for retransmission. 
Alternatively they may represent a constant delayed secondary stream

of lower-quality, lower-bandwidth audio that a receiver may use as a 
substitute for lost primary data. Section 2.3 describes the possible 
types of redundant data in detail.

 
2.1 RTP Header Extension 

2.1.1 Main Header Extension 
                    
The following header extension shall be at the front of every AC-3 RTP 
payload.  The primary purpose of this main header is to indicate the 
number of frames or fragments present in the packet.  The term "Data 
Unit" is used to reference AC-3 data be they a full frame or a 
fragment. Figure 3 shows the format of this header extension.

2.2 Fragmentation of AC-3 Frames 
 
The size of AC-3 frames remain constant throughout an encode procedure 
of a particular piece of audio, but the frame size can vary depending 
upon the sample rate of the uncompressed audio, and the compression 
rate applied by the encoder. According to table 5.13 in [2], AC-3 
frame sizes range from a minimum of 128 bytes to a maximum of 3840 
bytes. 
 
AC-3 frame sizes may be large enough to require fragmentation before 
transmission within an RTP packet. For example, an audio file sampled at
32 kHz and compressed with a desired bit rate of 640 kbps would produce 
AC-3 frames of 3840 bytes each. This exceeds the standard 1500 byte MTU 
of an Ethernet network and the 1492 byte MTU of the PPPoE protocol.  In 
[3] it is specified that fragmentation should not be left to the IP 
layer, but instead should be handled by the application itself. 
 
AC-3 frames were designed to accommodate memory buffers smaller than an 
entire AC-3 frame.  For this reason, each AC-3 frame contains two 16-bit
CRC words.  CRC1 is contained in the synchronization information (SI) 
header located at the beginning of each AC-3 frame. CRC1 is the second 
16-bit word of the frame.  Figure 6 shows the structure of the SI 
header.

CRC2 is the last 16-bit word of an AC-3 frame as shown in Figure 1.  
CRC1 applies to the first 5/8ths of the frame excluding the sync word. 
CRC2 covers the remaining 3/8ths of the frame as well as the entire 
frame (excluding the sync word). 
 
All AC-3 encoders enforce specific block size restrictions that 
guarantee blocks 0 and 1 are completely covered by CRC1 [2]. Ensuring 
that blocks 0 and 1 are in the first 5/8ths of the frame is necessary 
because block 0 contains information that is shared with the remaining 5 
blocks.  The dual CRC allows decoders to immediately begin processing 
block 0 when the 5/8ths point is reached. 
           
This 5/8ths split in all AC-3 frames, which was intended for the 
possibility of smaller input buffers (assuming a guaranteed transport 
stream such as S/PDIF), provides a very logical fragmentation unit. 
Using the 5/8ths point provides two possible gains over arbitrary 
fragmentation: 
 
        1) Using 5/8ths fragmentation, if the second fragment is 
           dropped, the first fragment can still be decoded by an AC-3 
           decoder.  Block 1 will be repeated in place of any missing 
           blocks lost in the second fragment. 

        2) In closed networks with no QoS problems, it may be possible 
           to use smaller buffers, as was intended in the original 
           design of the 5/8ths split. 
                 
In [2] the 5/8ths point is defined as: 
 
        5/8-framesize = truncate(framesize/2) + truncate(framesize/8) 
 
According to table 7.34 in [2], 5/8ths frame sizes can range from 80 
bytes to 2400 bytes.  Hence there are still instances where the 5/8ths 
boundary may exceed the MTU of the underlying network.  In an Ethernet 
network this would be rare because the majority of AC-3 data publicly 
available is sampled at 48kHz and is encoded at a data rate of 384kbps 
or 448kbps.  This provides a 5/8thspoint of 960 bytes and 1120 bytes 
respectively, which would be less then the MTU of a typical Ethernet

network.  In the rare instances where even the 5/8ths point exceeds the 
MTU, AC-3 frames should be arbitrarily fragmented to a length that is 
less the MTU. 
 
It should be noted that using 5/8ths fragmentation in terms of smaller 
buffer sizes is only useful in networks where the inter-arrival jitter 
is less than the time needed to decode Blocks 0 and 1 of the AC-3 stream 
and play the uncompressed audio. 
 
        JitterLimit = DecodeTime(Block 0 & 1) + 2 * (256/Fs), 
        where Fs is the sample rate of the uncompressed audio 
 
 
2.3 Data Resiliency 
 
This section provides information on how to encapsulate redundant data 
into an RTP payload to ensure the reception of all the AC-3 data being 
sent.  There are several types of redundant data that can be sent, which
are defined in section 2.1.2 and specified for each data unit in the 
data unit header.  The various types of redundant data are further 
discussed in the following sections. 
 
As a general rule redundant data of any type should never repeat primary 
audio information from the same RTP payload. 
 

2.3.1 Lower Bit Rate Data  
 
Transmitting redundant AC-3 frames encoded at a lower data rate (and 
thus quality) than the primary AC-3 audio is an obvious means of 
enhancing data resiliency. This approach allows the AC-3 decoder to 
decode the lower quality frame if the packet containing the high-quality
audio is dropped, lost, or arrives with errors. However, the lower 
quality data may still require an undesirably large amount of bandwidth.
Also, the redundant data can be extremely low quality, especially in 
cases where large numbers of channels are being transmitted. Retaining 
the original number of channels at a low data rate may result in sound 
quality that is subjectively unpleasant to listen to. Rather than simply
lower the quality of all channels to achieve resuced bandwidth, a more 
desirable approach may be to mix the multiple channels down into stereo 
and encode the resulting two-channel audio into lower bit-rate, but 
subjectively more listenable, AC-3 data.
 
2.3.2 Lower Bit Rate Data with Fewer Channels 

When encoding multichannel audio, a secondary two-channel version of the
audio can also be encoded at a lower bit rate.  Since the audio is 
reduced to two channels, it is still possible to maintain high quality 
even at a lower bit rate.  The lower bit-rate two-channel version can be
interleaved with the multichannel audio, and when a packet is lost or 

Hager/Flaks                 Expires June 2003                   [Page 9]

Internet Draft      RTP Payload Format for AC-3 Streams     January 2003


corrupted the two-channel version can be used in its place.


2.3.3 5/8ths and 3/8ths Fragment 
 
Another method of sending redundant data might include fragmentation of 
packets at the 5/8ths split and interleaving fragments from previous 
frames.  This ensures that all data is sent twice, which decreases the 
likelihood of lost data.

                 Figure 7. 5/8ths û 3/8ths Interleaving


 
In addition it is possible that one may wish to only send the 5/8ths 
fragment as redundant data.  Since the 5/8ths fragment can be decoded on
its own, it would allow for redundant data at a lower overall bit rate. 
However because block repeats are used when only the first 5/8ths is 
present, the quality would be significantly reduced if the redundant 
data was to be used.

2.3.4 5/8ths Fragment Lower Bit Rate 
 
Following the methods listed in the previous section, it may also be 
beneficial to send the redundant fragments at a lower bit rate. Ideally 
a lower bit rate version of the previous frames 5/8ths fragment could be
sent along, which would provide for a very low bit rate redundant data 
channel.

2.3.5 5/8ths and 3/8ths Fragment Lower Bit Rate and Fewer Channels 
 
Combining the methods from 2.3.2 and 2.3.3 a version of the 5/8ths 
fragment that is lower in bit rate and is composed of fewer channels may
be sent as redundant data.  This provides and opportunity for low bit 
rate redundant data that has fewer channels but less quality 
degradation. 
 
 
3 RTP header fields 
 
Payload Type (PT): It is expected that the RTP profile for a particular 
class of applications will assign a payload type for this encoding, or 
alternatively a payload type in the dynamic range [96,127] shall be 
chosen. 
 
Marker (M) bit:  The M bit is set for last fragment of an AC-3 frame. 

In instances where one or more full AC-3 frames is encapsulated in an 
RTP packet the M bit will be set and the full frame itself will be 
considered the last fragment. 
 
Extension (X) bit: Defined by the RTP profile used. 

Timestamp: A 32-bit word that corresponds to the sampling instant for 
the first AC-3 frame in an RTP packet.  AC-3 encodes data sampled at 32 
kHz, 44.1 kHz, and 48 kHz.  Fragmented frames shall maintain the same 
time stamp until the last fragment is sent.  The starting timestamp is 
selected at random. 


4 Types and Names 

4.1 MIME type registration 

MIME media type name:                   audio

MIME subtype name:                      ac3

Required parameters: 
        Rate: Equal to the RTP timestamp clock rate for the particular 
        AC-3 stream of a given RTP session.  In the case on a single 
        frame per a packet, and the AC-3 stream was encoded at 48Khz at 
        a bit rate of 384 kbps the rate parameter would equal 32 
        milliseconds.

        In the case of interleaving the 5/8ths and 3/8ths fragments 
        assuming the AC-3 file was encoded again at 48Khz with a bit 
        rate of 384 kbps the clock rate would need to be one half of 32 
        milliseconds or 16 milliseconds.

Optional parameters:                     
        Channels: How many channels are present in the AC3 stream.
        This will be a number between 1 and 6. 

        Ptime: The length of time in milliseconds represented by the 
        AC-3 frame(s) in the packet.
         
        Maxptime: The maximum amount of media which can be encapsulated 
        in each RTP packet, expressed as time in milliseconds 
 
Encoding considerations:                 
The AC-3 bitstream shall be generated according to the AC-3 
specification [2].  This bitstream is binary data and MUST be encoded 
for non-binary transport (for Email or any transport that cannot 
accommodate binary directly, the Base64 encoding is sufficient). This 
type is also defined for transfer via RTP.  All RTP packets MUST be 
packetized using the RTP payload format described in this document. 
 
Security considerations:                        see section 5 of this
                                                document

4.2 SDP usage 
 
The encoding name when using SDP [3] SHALL be "ac3" (MIME subtype). An 
example of the media representation in SDP is given below. 
 
m = audio 49000 RTP/AVP 100 
a = rtpmap:100 ac3/48000
a = fmtp:100 number-channels=[1-6] 
 

5. Security considerations 
 
In order to protect copyrighted material, certain security precautions 
may be necessary.  The payload format described in this document is 
subject to the security considerations defined in [4]. The security 
considerations discussed in [4] imply the usage of encryption to protect
the confidentiality of content.  Such an encryption scheme is harmless 
to the encoded audio data presuming the data is decrypted before being 
sent to the decoder.
