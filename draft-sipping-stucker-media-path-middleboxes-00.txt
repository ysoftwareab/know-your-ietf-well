Abstract

   Middleboxes are defined as any intermediary box performing functions
   apart from normal, standard functions of an IP router on the data
   path between a source host and destination host.  Two such functions
   are network address translation and firewalling.

   When Application Layer Gateways, such as SIP entities, interact with

   NATs and firewalls, as described in the MIDCOM architecture, then
   problems may occur in the transport of media traffic when signaling
   protocol interaction takes place along the media path, as it is the
   case for recent key exchange proposals (such as DTLS-SRTP).  This
   document highlights problems that may arise.  Unfortunately, it is
   difficult for the end points to detect or predict problematic
   behavior and to determine whether the media path is reliably
   available for packet exchange.

   This document aims to summarize the various sources and effects of
   NAT and firewall control, the reasons that they exist, and possible
   means of improving their behavior to allow protocols that rely upon
   signaling along the media path to operate effectively.

Internet-Draft           Middlebox Interactions            November 2007


1.  Introduction

   According to by RFC 3234 [RFC3234] middleboxes are defined as any
   intermediary box performing functions apart from normal, standard
   functions of an IP router on the data path between a source host and
   destination host.

   In the context of SIP a SIP ALG may interact with a node along the
   media path to control network address translation, firewalling, and
   other functions.

      With firewall control packet filters are installed based on the
      SIP signaling interaction to implement a behavior of 'deny by
      default' in order to reduce the risk of unwanted traffic.  This
      function is often referred to as 'gating'.  Depending on the
      timing of the packet filter installation and the content of the
      packet filter signaling traffic along the media, such as DTLS-SRTP
      or ICE, may be treated in an unexpected way.

      In cases where the middlebox is involved in overcoming unmanaged
      NAT traversal the case is similar.  The key feature of this type
      of NAT traversal is a desire to overcome the possible lack of
      information about any [RFC4787] address and/or port mapping by a
      possibly unknown NAT device (server reflexive address and
      filtering properties).  In particular, a NAT binding for an
      endpoint may not exist yet for the address and port identified in
      the endpoint's SDP.  As such, a pilot packet sent by that endpoint
      behind the NAT is required to create the necessary mappings in the
      NAT for the media relay to deliver media destined for that
      endpoint.  Until that pilot packet is received no media packets
      may be reliably forwarded to the endpoint by the relay.

   This document presents a summary of these two techniques, discusses
   their impact upon other protocols such as ICE and DTLS-SRTP, and
   proposes a set of recommendations to mitigate the effects of gating
   and latching on in-band negotiation mechanisms.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   We use the terms filter, policy action (or action), policy rule(s),
   MIDCOM agent, and MIDCOM Policy Decision Point (PDP) as defined in
   [RFC3303].  The MIDCOM agent is co-located with a SIP ALG that
   comunicates with the firewall or the media relay.

3.  Architecture

   Figure 1 shows the architecture that is being considered in this
   document with respect to firewall and NAT traversal using media
   relaying.  The timing and directionality with which media packets are
   allowed to traverse a particular edge device is the subject of this
   investigation.  The MIDCOM agent thereby pushes policy rules to the
   middlebox that allow or deny certain flows to bypass.  Additionally,
   in case of media relaying it is important for the MIDCOM agent to
   adjust the signaling messages.

   The aspects of packet filtering are described in Section 4 whereas
   NAT traversal is illustrated in Section 5.


4.  Packet Filtering

   Figure 1 highlights the interaction between the MIDCOM agent and the
   middlebox.  These two elements inspect call control signaling and
   media path packets and determine when packets from a given source to
   a given destination are allowed to flow between endpoints.  It is
   common for the gate controller to be the local outbound proxy for a
   given SIP UA being gated.

   The primary responsibility of the MIDCOM agent, which is co-located
   with a SIP entity, is to examine the call control signaling to
   determine the media addresses and ports used to define the media path
   between the gated device and the endpoint(s) with which it is
   corresponding.  For SIP, this would correspond to the media addresses
   described within SDP after at least one full offer/answer exchange.

   This information is used to create one or more packet filters that
   describe the expected media path(s) for the call.  These packet

Internet-Draft           Middlebox Interactions            November 2007


   filters are combined with an algorithmic determination, typically
   based on the state of the call, as to which direction(s) media
   packets are allowed to flow between the endpoints, if at all.  The
   filter and the action that is being installed by the MIDCOM agent at
   the middlebox may change during the lifetime of a SIP signaling
   session, depending on the state of the call or on changes of the
   address and port information of one (or even both) of the end points.

   It is possible that the gate controller may not be able to establish
   an exact address or port for one endpoint involved in the call in
   which case it may wildcard the address and/or port for the source
   and/or destination endpoint in the packet flow filter.  In such a
   case, the packet flow filter is considered to have matched against a
   given media packet for the wildcarded field.

   Note that it is possible to specify the filter using wildcards, for
   example, if some end point address information is not known at a
   given point in time.  Additonally, the default firewalling policy is
   subject to local configuration ('deny per default' vs. 'permit per
   default').  For a given SIP signaling sessions the policy at the
   MIDCOM agent might be very strict with respect to the packets that
   are allowed to flow in a particular direction.  For example, packets
   may be allowed to flow in both directions, only in one direction for
   a specific media stream.  No particular behavior can be assumed.

   When a media session is destroyed (end of call, deleted from the
   session description, etc.), the MIDCOM agent removes policy rules
   created for that media session at the middlebox.

4.1.  Protocol Interaction

   MIDCOM agents may employ a variety of models to determine when to
   change the status of a particular policy rule.  This is especially
   true when a call is being established.  For SIP, this would be when
   an early dialog is established between endpoints.  Although there is
   the potential for a great deal of variability due to an intentional
   lack of specification, typically, one of two models is used by the
   MIDCOM agent to determine the state of a policy rule during call
   setup: single-stage and two-stage commit.  The term 'commit' here
   refers to the point at which a policy rule is setup that allows media
   traffic to flow.  For example, this would be the point at which
   packets for a media stream marked a=sendrecv in SDP was allowed to
   flow bi-directionally by the middlebox.

4.1.1.  Single-Stage Commit

   Single stage commit is commonly used when the MIDCOM agent is most
   involved only in firewalling.  For SIP, MIDCOM agents use a single-

   stage commit model typically install policy rules for the call when
   the 200 OK to the INVITE is received in the case that the INVITE
   contained an SDP offer, or when the ACK is received if the initial
   offer was sent in the 200 OK itself.

   This model is often used to prevent media from being sent end-to-end
   prior to the call being established.

          Figure 2: Example Single-stage Commit with SIP and SDP

   In the example above, policy is created in steps 4 and 5 to allow bi-
   directional media flow based on the SDP exchanged in steps 1 and 3.
   In this example, the MIDCOM agent installes the policies after the
   200 OK to the INVITE arrives in step 3.  With a firewalling policy of
   'deny by default' media sent prior to steps 5 and 4 by the UAC or UAS
   is discarded by the middleboxes.

   Noted that early media that arrives before the 200 OK would require
   special treatement since otherwise it would be dropped as well.

4.1.2.  Two-Stage Commit

   Two-stage commit is used when the MIDCOM agent also providers
   functionality, such as Quality of Service signaling that may require
   resources to reserved early on in the call establishment process
   before it is known if the call will be answered.  An example of this
   would be where the MIDCOM agent is responsible for guaranteeing a
   minimum level of bandwidth along the media path.  In this case an
   initial set of policies may be sent by the MIDCOM agent to the
   middlebox even though they are put into a pending state but trigger a
   resource reservation.  Later, when the call is accepted, the gate
   controller may update the state of the policies to active them.

            Figure 3: Example Two-stage Commit with SIP and SDP

   In the example above, policies are created in steps 5 and 6 based off
   of the SDP sent in steps 1 and 3 in an initial inactive state (no
   packets are allowed to flow) despite the SDP indicating the media

   should be bi-directional.  This interaction with the middlebox,
   however, triggers a QoS reservation to take place.  Later, when the
   200 OK to the INVITE comes in step 7, the policies are updated in
   steps 8 and 9 to indicate that packets should be allowed to flow bi-
   directionally.  Although functionally equivalent to the single-stage
   commit example given earier in Figure 2, other operations at the gate
   agent may have been performed simultaneously in steps 5 and 6 that
   justifies the early explicit definition of the gates in an inactive
   state.  The full usage of PRACK here is not shown for purposes of
   brevity.

4.2.  Further Reading

   Packet filtering based on the approach described in this document has
   been described in a number of documents.  Although the usage of this
   architecture can also be found on the Internet their behavior is
   largely specified only in documents that relate to IMS
   standardization.  The behavior of the devices deployed on the
   Internet is therefore largely undocumented.  Nevertheless, the
   following documents give the reader a better idea of the
   functionality and the signaling interaction.  These documents may
   also specify an additional behavior in relation to how packet
   filtering is used when the MIDCOM agent is responsible for processing
   SIP/SDP call control signaling and the middlebox is responsible for a
   variety of activities beyond pure filtering.  For example, it is
   common for middleboxes to exempt RTCP flows from being blocked even
   though the associated RTP flows are not allowed to flow in order to
   support RTCP signaling while a call is on hold.  These references are
   given here for the reader to gather a better understanding of how
   this is mechanism is used in various forums and is non-exhaustive:

       [TS-23-203]

   2.  3GPP, "TS 29.214: Policy and charging control over Rx reference
       point" [TS-29-214]

       (TISPAN); Resource and Admission Control Sub-system (RACS);

   Note that different terms are used for the MIDCOM agent and the
   middlebox.  For example, in an IMS context the MIDCOM agent would be
   part of the P-CSCF and PCRF elements or in TISPAN it would be part of

   the P-CSCF, A-RACF and SPDF that are involved in controlling gating
   operations.  Many different elements perform the role of a middlebox:
   GSM GGSN, CDMA PDSN, SAE serving gateway, TISPAN A-BGF/C-BGF/I-BGF,
   PacketCable CMTS, etc.  These functions may be present in the network
   in a unified or decomposed architecture.


5.  NAT Traversal

   One NAT traversal technique that is being used is based on media
   relay.  As shown in Figure 1 the MIDCOM agent that is being co-
   located with the SIP ALG functionality interacts with the middlebox
   that is also a NAT in order to request and allocate NAT bindings.  A
   side effect of the interaction with a (double) NAT is that the media
   traffic is forced to traverse a certain NAT in both directions (also
   called media anchoring).

   This architecture could be compared with a STUN relay
   [I-D.ietf-behave-turn] that is being controlled by the MIDCOM agent
   rather than the end point itself.  The motivation why this technique
   is being used in favor to other NAT traversal techniques is that
   clients do not have to support anything beyond RFC 3261 [RFC3261] and
   network administrators can control and apply local policy to the
   relay binding process in a centralized manner.

5.1.  Protocol Interaction

   The MIDCOM agent's role is to inspect call control signaling and
   update media address and port values based upon media relay binding
   information allocated with the middlebox/media relay.  For SIP, this
   minimally involves updating the c= and m= lines in the SDP, although
   some implementations may update other elements of the SDP for various
   reasons.

   Because the endpoints may not be able to gather a server reflexive
   address for their media streams, the MIDCOM agent employs the
   following algorithm to ensure that media can flow to the given
   endpoint:

   1.  Give the corresponding endpoint an address and port on the
       middlebox for them to send media to for the endpoint served by
       the MIDCOM agent.

   2.  Give the served endpoint a different address and/or port on the
       middlebox for it to send media to for the corresponding endpoint.

   3.  Use the address and port the corresponding endpoint supplies for
       media streams as the destination for packets sent to the

       middlebox by the served endpoint.

   4.  Use the address and port of the first packet received from the
       served endpoint at the middlebox as the destination for packets
       sent to the middlebox by the corresponding endpoint.

   An example of this algorithm is shown in Figure 4 using SIP and SDP.
   In this example the UAC is the endpoint served by the MIDCOM agent,
   which is also acting as a local outbound proxy, and the UAS is the
   corresponding endpoint.

                    Figure 4: Call Flow with SIP + SDP

   1.   UAC sends INVITE to local outbound proxy, which is also a MIDCOM
        agent, with an SDP offer.

   2.   The MIDCOM agent looks at the signaling and determines that a
        NAT may be present (Via header address mismatch with observed
        source address, etc.).  It asks the middlebox to allocate a
        media relay binding.

   3.   The middlebox responds with a media relay binding that consists
        of an inbound address/port for media from the UAS, and an
        outbound address/port for media from the UAC.

   4.   The MIDCOM agent updates the addresses in the SDP offer with the
        inbound address/port information from the middlebox/media relay
        binding response.

   5.   The UAS responds with a 180 containing an SDP answer.

   6.   The MIDCOM agent interacts with the middlebox to update the
        destination address/port information from the SDP answer for
        media to be sent to the UAS, and changes the addresses/ports in
        the SDP answer to the UAC with the outbound address/port
        information from the middlebox binding from step 3.  Media can
        now flow to the UAS from the UAC at the middlebox/media relay.

   7.   The UAC receives the SDP answer containing the media relay
        outbound address/port information.

   8.   The UAS answers the INVITE with a 200 OK.

   9.   The UAC acknowledges with an ACK.

   10.  RTP for the UAS (which may have begun flowing prior to answer)
        flows to the middlebox, but the middlebox has no reliable
        address to relay the media to for the UAC yet.  Media will
        typically be dropped.

   11.  RTP arrives at the media relay on the inbound address/port from
        the UAC.  The middlebox observes the source address and port of
        the arriving packet and completes the binding process.  The
        source address and port of the media from the UAC is now the
        destination address/port for media arriving on the outbound port
        of the middlebox/media relay from the UAS.

   12.  Media from the UAC is relayed to the UAS.

   13.  Media from the UAS is relayed to the UAC.  It is up to local
        policy at the media relay as to whether or not packets that had
        arrived from the UAS for the UAC are queued or dropped prior to
        the UAC's address/port information being updated in step 11.

5.2.  Further Reading

   Although the described NAT traversal approach is used by a number of
   implementations to overcome incorrect address/port information in
   call control signaling from an endpoint behind a NAT, only one
   reference is known that describes the functionality in a standardized
   manner.

   1.  ETSI TISPAN, "ES 282-003: Telecommunications and Internet
       converged Services and Protocols for Advanced Networking
       (TISPAN); Resource and Admission Control Sub-system (RACS);
       Functional Architecture" [TISPAN-ES-282-003].  The TISPAN Ia
       interface between the TISPAN BGF and SPDF is the relevant
       specification.


6.  Interactions between Media Path Signaling and Middlebox Behavior

   This section points to the problems that occur when signaling
   exchanges are performed along the media path when middleboxes are
   present that behave in the way described in this document.

Internet-Draft           Middlebox Interactions            November 2007


6.1.  Firewalling

   The description in Section 4 highlighted that the timing of the
   policy rule installation by the MIDCOM agent towards the middlebox
   has an impact on when and what media traffic is allowed to traverse.

   Hence, the middlebox prevents the exchange of packets in the media
   path until the session establishment signaling has reached a pre-
   configured milestone where the MIDCOM agent signals to the middlebox
   that packets are allowed to traverse in both directions.  Prior to
   this, packets may be allowed to flow uni-directionally to satisfy
   certain service requirements or may be entirely blocked by the
   middlebox.  For SIP [RFC3261] the typically milestone that must be
   reached is offer/answer exchange [RFC3264] accompanied by an
   acknowledgement that the dialog has been accepted by the UAS (i.e.,
   200 OK to the INVITE).  A concrete example of the impact can be found
   with the case of key exchange along the media path, as it is provided
   by DTLS-SRTP.  Figure 2 of [I-D.fischl-sipping-media-dtls] shows that
   the arrival of the SIP INVITE at the UAS triggers the DTLS handshake.
   This message would be blocked by the middlebox, as described in
   Section 4 since the MIDCOM agent has not yet installed policy rules.
   The consequence is that the DTLS key exchange is delayed until the
   policy rules are installed and that media traffic that is sent before
   the DTLS exchange is completed may be dropped and the user
   experiences clippping.

   Unlike with the pilot packet used for NAT traversal, the bi-
   directional media path is established via the signaling path, not via
   packets sent along the media path.  In some deployment models, RTCP
   is always available bi-directionally regardless of the installed
   policy rules.  Obviously, this is not a property that can be
   guaranteed to be true in the future.

6.2.  NAT Traversal

   The described NAT traversal interaction prevents asynchronous
   exchange of packets in the media path until a pilot packet has been
   received by the middlebox from the endpoint being served.  It can be
   employed for both the [RFC3264] offerer and/or answerer.  Therefore,
   in the worst case, both endpoints must generate a pilot packet
   towards each other to ensure a bi-directional media path exists.  Any
   signaling on the media path that relies upon a uni-directional
   handshake in the reverse direction may not complete until media in
   the forward direction by the other endpoint.  If signaling on the
   media path is required to complete prior to media generation the
   handshake may stall indefinitely.

7.  Preliminary Recommendations

   The following preliminary recommendations are suggested:

   REC #1:   It is recommended that any protocol handshake on the media
      path ensure that a mechanism exists that causes both endpoints to
      send at least one packet in the forward direction as part of, or
      prior to, the handshake process.  Retransmission of STUN
      connectivity checks (see [I-D.ietf-behave-rfc3489bis]) as part of
      ICE [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice] is an example of such a mechanism that
      satisfies this recommendation.

   REC #2:   It is recommended that middleboxes present on the media
      path allow a nominal amount of traffic to be exchanged between
      endpoints to enable completion of media path signaling prior to
      the session being established.  The amount of traffic necessary to
      complete the signaling between endpoints is expected to be orders
      of magnitude smaller than that of any sufficiently interesting
      fraudulent traffic.

   REC #3:   It is recommended that failure to complete signaling on the
      media path not automatically cause the session establishment to
      fail unless explicitly specified by one or more endpoints.  A
      fallback scenario where signaling on the media path is retried
      after the session has been established is recommended.


8.  Security Considerations

   This document talks about security related functionality and the
   impact of one security mechanism, namely firewalling, to another one,
   namely key management for media security.


9.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require actions by IANA.
