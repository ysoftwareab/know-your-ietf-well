Internet-Draft            LEMONADE architecture                July 2008


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the architecture of OMA mobile email (MEM)
   using Internet Mail protocols defined by the IETF.  The LEMONADE work
   group has enhanced many of these protocols for use in the mobile
   environment and are summarized in the LEMONADE profile [PROFILE] and
   its revision LEMONADE profile bis [PROFILE-bis].  This document shows
   how the OMA MEM Requirement document [MEM-req], OMA MEM Architecture
   [MEM-arch], and OMA MEM Technical Specification [MEM-ts] relate to
   the work of LEMONADE.


2.  OMA Mobile Email (MEM)

   The OMA Mobile Email (MEM) sub-working group has spent some time
   studying the requirements and architecture of mobile email.  IETF
   LEMONADE has been liaising with them and has based much of our
   Internet Mail enhancements based on their input.  This section
   summarizes the output of the OMA.

2.1.  OMA MEM Requirements

   The OMA MEM activity collected a set of use cases and derived
   requirements for a mobile email enabler (MEM).  The OMA MEM
   Requirements [MEM-req] summarizes this work.  Some requirements
   relates to email protocols, some involve other OMA technologies
   outside the scope of IETF and some relate to implementations and
   normative interoperability statements for clients and servers.

2.2.  OMA MEM Architecture

   This section introduces the OMA MEM Architecture.

2.2.1.  OMA MEM logical Architecture

   The OMA MEM activity has derived a logical architecture from the
   requirements and use cases described in [MEM-req].  A simplification
   for illustrative purposes is shown in Figure 1, where arrows indicate
   content flows.

               Figure 1: Basic OMA MEM logical architecture

   Figure 1 identifies the following elements:
   o  The MEM client that implements the client-side functionality of
      the OMA Mobile Email Enabler.  It is also responsible for
      providing the mobile email user experience and interface to the
      user and storing the email and data to be sent to the MEM server
      when not connected.
   o  The MEM server that implements the server-side functionality of
      the OMA Mobile Email Enabler (MEM).
   o  The MEM protocol between the MEM Client and MEM Server.  It is
      responsible for all the in-band data exchanges that take place
      between the MEM client and server in order to update the MEM
      client with email server changes, the email server with changes in
      the MEM client and to send new email from the email server.
   o  Other OMA enablers are needed to directly support the mobile email
      enabler.  They are out of scope of IETF but they may include
      support for:
      *  Client provisioning and management for over the air
         installation of the MEM client on the device, provisioning of
         its settings and revocation,
      *  Messaging enablers for out-of-band notification, where out-of-
         band notifications that are server to client event exchanges
         not transported by the MEM protocol but via other channels, and
      *  Billing, charging, and so on.

   OMA identifies different interfaces:
   o  ME-1: MEM client interface to interact via the MEM protocol with
      the MEM server
   o  ME-2: Corresponding interface of the MEM server

Internet-Draft            LEMONADE architecture                July 2008


   o  ME-3: Out-of-band MEM server interfaces, for example to support
      generation of server to client notifications.
   o  ME-4: Out-of-band MEM client interfaces (e.g. to receive server to
      client notifications).
   o  ME-5: Interface for management of MEM enabler server settings,
      user preferences, and filters, globally and per account.

   The MEM server enables an email server.  In a particular
   implementation, the email server may be packaged with (internal to
   it) the MEM server or be a separate component.  In such cases,
   interfaces to the email server are out of scope of the OMA MEM
   specifications.  In the present document, we focus on the case where
   the backend consists of IETF IMAP and Submit servers.  However, we
   also discuss the relationship to other cases.  The I2 interface is an
   OMA notation to designate protocol / interfaces that are not
   specified by the MEM enabler but may be standardized elsewhere.

2.2.2.  OMA MEM Deployment Issues

   The OMA MEM Architecture document [MEM-arch] further identifies
   deployment models.

2.2.2.1.  OMA MEM proxy

   The OMA MEM Architecture document [MEM-arch] identifies OMA MEM
   server proxies as server components that may be deployed ahead of
   firewalls to facilitate firewall traversal.

2.2.2.2.  OMA MEM deployment cases

   OMA MEM identifies that each component (MEM client, MEM servers,
   other enablers, and the email server) may be deployed in different
   domains, possibly separated by firewalls and other network
   intermediaries.  MEM proxies may be involved in front of firewall
   that protects the MEM server domain.

   OMA MEM targets support of configurations where:
   o  All components are within the same domain, such as in a mobile
      operator
   o  MEM client and other enablers are in the mobile operator domain,
      there is a MEM proxy, and the MEM server and email server are in
      the domain of the email service provider
   o  MEM client and other enablers as well as a MEM proxy are in the
      mobile operator domain, MEM server and email server are in the
      domain of the email service provider
   o  MEM client and other enablers are in the mobile operator domain, a
      MEM proxy is in a third party service provider domain and MEM
      server and email server are in the domain of the email service

Internet-Draft            LEMONADE architecture                July 2008


      provider
   o  MEM client, other enabler and MEM server are in the mobile
      operator domain and email server is in the domain of the email
      service provider
   o  MEM client and other enablers are in the mobile operator domain,
      MEM server is in a third party service provider domain and the
      email server is in the domain of the email service provider

   The e-mail service provider can be either a third-party service
   provider, a network service provider, or an enterprise e-mail
   service.

2.3.  OMA MEM Technical Specification

   The OMA MEM activity will conclude with a specification for a mobile
   email enabler (MEM).  The ongoing work is in OMA MEM Technical
   Specification [MEM-ts].  LEMONADE is a basis for the mechanism.
   However, some additional details that are outside the scope of IETF
   will also be included.

   OMA provides ways to perform provisioning via OMA client provisioning
   and device management.  Other provisioning specifications are
   available (e.g., SMS based).

   OMA provides enablers to support out-of-band notification mechanisms,
   as well as filter specifications (such as XDM), remote device
   deactivation, and other, non-Internet activities.


3.  IETF LEMONADE Architecture

   This section introduces the LEMONADE Architecture.

   The IETF LEMONADE activity has derived a LEMONADE profile
   [PROFILE-bis] with the logical architecture represented in Figure 2,
   where arrows indicate content flows.

                  Figure 2: LEMONADE logical architecture

   The LEMONADE profile [PROFILE] assumes:
   o  IMAP protocol [RFC3501] including LEMONADE profile extensions
      [PROFILE]
   o  SUBMIT protocol [RFC4409], including LEMONADE profile extensions
   o  LEMONADE profile compliant IMAP store connected to MTA (Mail
      Transfer Agent) via ESMTP [RFC2821]
   o  LEMONADE profile compliant Submit server connected to an MTA,
      often via ESMTP
   o  Out-of-band server to client notifications relying on external
      notification mechanisms (and notification protocols) that may be
      out of scope of the LEMONADE profile.
   o  A LEMONADE aware MUA (Mail User Agent).  While use of out-of-band
      notification is described in the LEMONADE profile, support for the
      underlying notifications mechanisms/protocols is out of scope of
      the LEMONADE specifications.

   Further details on the IETF email protocol stack and architecture can
   be found in [MAIL]

    Figure 3: Mapping of LEMONADE logical architecture onto the OMA MEM
                           logical architecture

   As described in Section 3, the LEMONADE profile assumes LEMONADE
   profile compliant IMAP stores and Submit servers.  Because the
   LEMONADE profile extends the IMAP store and the submit server, the
   mobile enablement of email provided by the LEMONADE profile is
   directly provided in these servers.  Mapping to the OMA MEM logical
   architecture, for the case considered and specified by the LEMONADE
   profile, we logically combine the MEM server and email server.
   However, in lemonade we split them logically into a distinct LEMONADE
   message store and a LEMONADE submit server.  ME-2 consists of two

   interfaces.  ME-2a is IMAP extended according to the LEMONADE
   profile.  ME-2b is SUBMIT extended according to the LEMONADE profile.

   The MUA is part of the MEM client.

   The external notifications mechanism is part of OMA enablers
   specified by the OMA.

3.2.  LEMONADE realization of OMA MEM with non-LEMONADE compliant
      servers

   The OMA MEM activity is not limited to enabling Lemonade compliant
   servers.  It explicitly identifies the need to support other back-
   ends.  This is, of course, outside the scope of the IETF Lemonade
   activity.

3.2.1.  LEMONADE realization of OMA MEM with non-LEMONADE IMAP servers

   Figure 4 illustrates the case of IMAP servers that are not LEMONADE
   compliant.  In such case, the I2 interface between the MEM server
   components and the IMAP store and submit server are IMAP and SUBMIT
   without Lemonade extensions.

4.  Filters and server to client notifications and LEMONADE

   OMA MEM RD [MEM-req] and AD [MEM-arch] emphasize the need to provide
   mechanisms for server to client notifications of email events and
   filtering.  Figure 6 illustrates how notification and filtering works
   in the LEMONADE profile [PROFILE].

      Figure 6: Filtering mechanism defined in LEMONADE architecture

   In Figure 6, we define four categories of filters:
   o  AF: Administrative Filters - The e-mail service provider usually
      sets administrative filters.  The user typically does not
      configure AF.  AF applies policies covering content filtering,
      virus protection, spam filtering, etc.
   o  DF: Deposit Filters - Filters that are executed on deposit of new
      emails.  They can be defined as SIEVE filters [SIEVE].  They can
      include vacation notices [RFC5230].
   o  VF: View Filters - Filters that define which emails are visible to
      the MUA.  View filters can be performed via IMAP using the
      facilities described in [NOTIFICATIONS].
   o  NF: Notification Filters - Filters that define for what email
      server event an out-of-band notification is sent to the client, as
      described in [NOTIFICATIONS].

   The MUA can manage the NF and DF filters using the SIEVE management
   protocol [MANAGESIEVE].


5.  Security Considerations

   We note there are security risks associated with:

Internet-Draft            LEMONADE architecture                July 2008


   o  Out-of-band notifications
   o  Server configuration by client
   o  Client configuration by server
   o  Presence of MEM proxy servers
   o  Presence of MEM servers as intermediaries
   o  Measures to address the need to traverse firewalls

   We refer the reader to the relevant Internet Mail, IMAP, SUBMIT, and
   Lemonade documents for how we address these issues.


6.  IANA considerations

   None.
