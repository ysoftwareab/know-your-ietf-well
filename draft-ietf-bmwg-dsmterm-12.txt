Abstract       
     This document describes terminology for the benchmarking of 
     devices that implement traffic control based on IP precedence or 
     diff-serv code point criteria.  The terminology is to be applied
     to measurements made on the data plane to evaluate IP traffic
     control mechanisms.

1. Introduction 
      
     New terminology is needed because most existing measurements 
     assume the absence of congestion and only a single per-hop-
     behavior.  This document introduces several new terms that will 
     allow measurements to be taken during periods of congestion. 
      
     Another key difference from existing terminology is the definition 
     of measurements as observed on egress as well as ingress of a 
     device/system under test.  Again, the existence of congestion 
     requires the addition of egress measurements as well as those 
     taken on ingress; without observing traffic leaving a 
     device/system it is not possible to say whether traffic-control 
     mechanisms effectively dealt with congestion. 
      
     The principal measurements introduced in this document are vectors 
     for rate, delay, and jitter, all of which can be observed with or 
     without congestion of the DUT/SUT. 
      
     This document describes only those terms relevant to measuring 
     behavior of a device or a group of devices using one of these two 
     mechanisms.  End-to-end and service-level measurements are beyond 
     the scope of this document. 
            
2.  Existing definitions       
     RFC 1242 "Benchmarking Terminology for Network Interconnect 
     Devices" and RFC 2285 "Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching 
     Devices" SHOULD be consulted before attempting to make use of this 
     document. 
      
     RFC 2474 "Definition of the Differentiated Services Field (DS 
     Field) in the IPv4 and IPv6 Headers" section 2, contains 
     discussions of a number of terms relevant to network-layer traffic 
     control mechanisms and SHOULD also be consulted. 
      
     For the sake of clarity and continuity this RFC adopts the 
     template for definitions set out in Section 2 of RFC 1242.  
     Definitions are indexed and grouped together in sections for ease 
     of reference. 
      
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [Br97].  RFC 2119 defines the use of these key words to help make the
   intent of standards track documents as clear as possible.  While this
   document uses these keywords, this document is not a standards track
   document.

3. Term definitions       

     3.1 Configuration Terms       

     3.1.1 Classification 
      
        Definition: 
          Selection of packets based on the contents of packet header 
          according to defined rules. 
      
        Discussion: 
          Packets can be selected based on the DS field or IP 
          Precedence in the packet header.  Classification can also be 
          based on Multi-Field (MF) criteria such as IP Source and 
          destination addresses, protocol and port number. 
           
          Classification determines the per-hop behaviors and traffic 
          conditioning functions such as shaping and dropping that are 
          to be applied to the packet.

        See Also: None
            
     3.1.2 Codepoint Set  
     
        Definition: 
          The set of all DS Code-points or IP precedence values used 
          during the test duration. 
      
        Discussion: 
          Describes all the code-point markings associated with packets 
          that are input to the DUT/SUT.  For each entry in the 
          codepoint set, there are associated vectors describing the 
          rate of traffic, delay, loss, or jitter containing that 
          particular DSCP or IP precedence value. 
           
          The treatment that a packet belonging to a particular code-
          point gets is subject to the DUT classifying packets to map 
          to the correct PHB.  Moreover, the forwarding treatment in 
          general is also dependent on the complete set of offered 
          vectors.

     3.1.3 Forwarding Congestion 
      
        Definition: 
          A condition in which one or more egress interfaces are 
          offered more packets than are forwarded. 
      
        Discussion: 
          This condition is a superset of the overload definition 
          [Ma98].  Overload [Ma98] deals with overloading input and 
          output interfaces beyond the maximum transmission allowed by 
          the medium.  Forwarding congestion does not assume ingress 
          interface overload as the only source of overload on output 
          interfaces. 
           
          Another difference between Forwarding Congestion and overload 
          occurs when the SUT comprises multiple elements, in that 
          Forwarding Congestion may occur at multiple points.  Consider 
          a SUT comprising multiple edge devices exchanging traffic 
          with a single core device.  Depending on traffic patterns, 
          the edge devices may induce Forwarding Congestion on multiple 
          egress interfaces on the core device. 
           
          Throughput [Br91] defines the lower boundary of Forwarding 
          Congestion.  Throughput is the maximum offered rate with no 
          Forwarding Congestion.  At offered rates above throughput, 
          the DUT/SUT is considered to be in a state of Forwarding 
          Congestion. 

          Packet Loss, not increased Forwarding Delay, is the 
          external observable metric used to indicate the condition 
          of Forwarding Congestion.  Packet Loss is a deterministic 
          indicator of Forwarding Congestion.  The condition of 
          increased Forwarding Delay without Packet Loss is an 
          indicator of Forwarding Congestion known as Incipient 
          Congestion.   Incipient Congestion is a non-deterministic 
          indicator of Forwarding Congestion [Fl93].  As stated in 
          [Ec98], RED [BR98] detects incipient congestion before the 
          buffer overflows, but the current Internet environment is 
          limited to packet loss as the mechanism for indicating 
          congestion to the end-nodes. [Ra99] implies that it is 
          impractical to build a black-box test to observe Incipient 
          Congestion.  [Ra99] instead introduces Explicit Congestion 
          Notification (ECN) as a deterministic Black-Box method for 
          observing Incipient Congestion.  [Ra99] is an Experimental 
          RFC with limited deployment, so ECN is not used for this 
          particular methodology.  For the purpose of "black-box" 
          testing a DUT/SUT, this methodology uses Packet Loss as the 
          indicator of Forwarding Congestion.

                 Network-layer Traffic Control Mechanisms 
   
          Ingress observations alone are not sufficient to cover all 
          cases in which Forwarding Congestion may occur.  A device 
          with an infinite amount of memory could buffer an infinite 
          number of packets, and eventually forward all of them.  
          However, these packets may or may not be forwarded during 
          the test duration.  Congestion Collapse [Na84] is defined 
          as the state in which buffers are full and all arriving 
          packets MUST be dropped across the network.  Even though 
          ingress interfaces accept all packets without loss, 
          Forwarding Congestion is present in this hypothetical 
          device. 
           
          The definition presented here explicitly defines 
          Forwarding Congestion as an event observable on egress 
          interfaces.  Regardless of internal architecture, any 
          device exhibiting Packet Loss on one or more egress 
          interfaces is experiencing Forwarding Congestion.

     3.1.4 Congestion Management 
      
        Definition: 
          An implementation of one or more per-hop-behaviors to avoid 
          or minimize the condition of congestion. 
      
        Discussion: 
          Congestion management may seek either to control congestion 
          or avoid it altogether.  Such mechanisms classify packets 
          based upon IP Precedence or DSCP settings in a packets IP 
          header. 
           
          Congestion avoidance mechanisms seek to prevent congestion 
          before it actually occurs. 
           
          Congestion control mechanisms give one or more flows (with a 
          discrete IP Precedence or DSCP value) preferential treatment 
          over other classes during periods of congestion.

     3.1.5 Flow 
       
        Definition: 
          A flow is a one or more of packets sharing a common intended 
          pair of ingress and egress interfaces. 
      
        Discussion: 
          Packets are grouped by the ingress and egress interfaces they 
          use on a given DUT/SUT. 
           
          A flow can contain multiple source IP addresses and/or 
          destination IP addresses.  All packets in a flow MUST enter 
          on the same ingress interface and exit on the same egress 
          interface, and have some common network layer content. 
           
          Microflows [Ni98] are a subset of flows.  As defined in 
          [Ni98], microflows require application-to-application 
          measurement.  In contrast, flows use lower-layer 
          classification criteria.  Since this document focuses on 
          network-layer classification criteria, we concentrate here on 
          the use of network-layer identifiers in describing a flow.  
          Flow identifiers also may reside at the data-link, transport, 
          or application layers of the OSI model.  However, identifiers 
          other than those at the network layer are out of scope for 
          this document. 
           
          A flow may contain a single code point/IP precedence value or 
          may contain multiple values destined for a single egress 
          interface.  This is determined by the test methodology.

     3.2 Measurement Terms  
      
     3.2.1 Forwarding Capacity 
      
        Definition: 
          The number of packets per second that a device can be 
          observed to successfully transmit to the correct destination 
          interface in response to a specified offered load while the 
          device drops none of the offered packets.

                 Network-layer Traffic Control Mechanisms 
   
        Discussion: 
          Forwarding Capacity measures the packet rate at the egress 
          interface(s) of the DUT/SUT.  In contrast, throughput as 
          defined in RFC 1242 measures the packet rate at the ingress 
          interface(s) of the DUT/SUT. 
           
          Ingress-based measurements do not account for queuing of the 
          DUT/SUT.  Throughput rates can be higher than the Forwarding 
          Capacity because of queueing.  The difference is dependent 
          upon test duration, packet rate, and queue size.  Forwarding 
          Capacity, as an egress measurement, does take queuing into 
          account. 
           
          Understanding Forwarding Capacity is a necessary precursor to 
          any measurement involving Traffic Control Mechanisms.  The 
          accompanying methodology document MUST take into 
          consideration Forwarding Capacity when determining the 
          expected forwarding vectors.  When the sum of the expected 
          forwarding vectors on an interface exceeds the Forwarding 
          Capacity, the Forwarding Capacity will govern the forwarding 
          rate. 
           
          This measurement differs from forwarding rate at maximum 
          offered load (FRMOL) [Ma98] in that Forwarding Capacity 
          requires zero loss.

          Packets which lie within specific rate, delay, or jitter 
          bounds. 
      
        Discussion: 
          A DUT/SUT may be configured to allow a given traffic class to 
          consume a given amount of bandwidth, or to fall within 
          predefined delay or jitter boundaries.  All packets that lie 
          within specified bounds are then said to be conforming, 
          whereas those outside the bounds are nonconforming.

          Packets that do not lie within specific rate, delay, or

        Discussion: 
          A DUT/SUT may be configured to allow a given traffic class to 
          consume a given amount of bandwidth, or to fall within 
          predefined delay or jitter boundaries.  All packets that do

     3.2.4 Forwarding Delay 
      
        Definition: 
          The time interval starting when the last bit of the input IP 
          packet is offered to the input port of the DUT/SUT and ending 
          when the last bit of the output IP packet is received from 
          the output port of the DUT/SUT. 
           
        Discussion: 
          The delay time interval MUST be externally observed.  The 
          delay measurement MUST NOT include delays added by test bed 
          components other than the DUT/SUT, such as propagation time 
          introduced by cabling or non-zero delay added by the test 
          instrument. 
           
          Forwarding Delay differs from latency [Br91] and one-way 
          delay [Al99] in several key regards: 
           
          1. Latency [Br91] assumes knowledge of whether the DUT/SUT 
          uses "store and forward" or "bit forwarding" technology.  
          Forwarding Delay is the same metric, measured the same way, 
          regardless of the architecture of the DUT/SUT.

                 Network-layer Traffic Control Mechanisms 
   
           
          2. Forwarding Delay is a last-in, last-out (LILO) 
          measurement, unlike the last-in, first-out method [Br91] or 
          the first-in, last-out method [Al99]. 
           
          The LILO method most closely simulates the way a network-
          layer device actually processes an IP datagram.  IP datagrams 
          are not passed up and down the stack unless they are 
          complete, and processing begins only once the last bit of the 
          IP datagram has been received. 
           
          Further, the LILO method has an additive property, where the 
          sum of the parts MUST equal the whole.  This is a key 
          difference from [Br91] and [Al99].  For example, the delay 
          added by two DUTs MUST equal the sum of the delay of the 
          DUTs.  This may or may not be the case with [Br91] and 
          [Al99]. 
           
          3. Forwarding Delay measures the IP datagram only, unlike 
          [Br91], which also includes link layer overhead. 
           
          A metric focused exclusively on the Internet protocol 
          relieves the tester from specifying the start/end for every 
          link layer protocol that IP runs on.  This avoids the need to 
          determine whether the start/stop delimiters are included.  It 
          also allows the use of heterogeneous link layer protocols in 
          a test. 
           
          4. Forwarding Delay can be measured at any offered load, 
          whereas the latency methodology [Br99] recommends measurement 
          at, and only at, the throughput level.  Comparing the 
          Forwarding Delay below the throughput to Forwarding Delay 
          above the Forwarding Capacity will give insight to the 
          traffic control mechanisms. 
           
          For example, non-congested delay may be measured with an 
          offered load that does not exceed the Forwarding Capacity, 
          while congested delay may involve an offered load that 
          exceeds Forwarding Capacity. 
           
          Note: Forwarding Delay SHOULD NOT be used as an absolute 
          indicator of DUT/SUT Forwarding Congestion.  While Forwarding 
          Delay may rise when offered load nears or exceeds Forwarding 
          Capacity, there is no universal point at which Forwarding 
          Delay can be said to indicate the presence or absence of 
          Forwarding Congestion.

     3.2.5 Jitter 
      
        Definition: 
          The absolute value of the difference between the arrival 
          delay of two consecutive received packets belonging to the 
          same stream. 
      
        Discussion: 
          The Forwarding Delay fluctuation between two consecutive 
          received packets in a stream is reported as the Jitter.  
          Jitter can be expressed as |D(i) - D(i-1)| where D equals 
          the Forwarding Delay and i is the order the packets were 
          received. 
           
          Under loss, jitter can be measured between non-consecutive 
          test sequence numbers.  When IP Traffic Control Mechanisms 
          are dropping packets, fluctuating Forwarding Delay may be 
          observed.  Jitter MUST be able to benchmark the delay 
          variation independent of packet loss. 
           
          Jitter is related to the IPDV [De02] (IP Delay Variation) by 
          taking the absolute value of the ipdv.  The two metrics will 
          produce different mean values.  Mean Jitter will produce a 
          positive value, where the mean ipdv is typically zero.  Also,
          IPDV is undefined when one packet from a pair is lost.

     3.2.6 Undifferentiated Response 
      
        Definition: 
          The vector(s) obtained when mechanisms used to support
          diff-serv or IP precedence are disabled. 
      
        Discussion: 
          Enabling diff-serv or IP precedence mechanisms may impose 
          additional processing overhead for packets.  This overhead 
          may degrade performance even when traffic belonging to only 
          one class, the best-effort class, is offered to the device.

          Measurements with "undifferentiated response" SHOULD be made 
          to establish a baseline. 
           
          The vector(s) obtained with DSCP or IP precedence enabled can 
          be compared to the undifferentiated response to determine the 
          effect of differentiating traffic.

     3.3 Sequence Tracking  
      
     3.3.1 In-sequence Packet 
      
        Definition: 
          A received packet with the expected Test Sequence number. 
      
        Discussion: 
          In-sequence is done on a stream level.  As packets are 
          received on a stream, each packets Test Sequence number is 
          compared with the previous packet.  Only packets that match 
          the expected Test Sequence number are considered in-sequence. 
           
          Packets that do not match the expected Test Sequence number 
          are counted as "not in-sequence" or out-of-sequence.  Every 
          packet that is received is either in-sequence or out-of-
          sequence.  Subtracting the in-sequence from the received 
          packets (for that stream), the tester can derive the 
          out-of-sequence count. 
           
          Two types of events will prevent the in-sequence from 
          incrementing: packet loss and reordered packets.

        Discussion: 
          As a stream of packets enters a DUT/SUT, they include a 
          Stream Test Sequence number indicating the order the packets 
          were sent to the DUT/SUT.  On exiting the DUT/SUT, these 
          packets may arrive in a different order.  Each packet that 
          was re-ordered is counted as an Out-of-order Packet. 
           
          Certain streaming protocol (such as TCP) require the packets 
          to be in a certain order.  Packets outside this are dropped 
          by the streaming protocols even though there were properly 
          received by the IP layer.  The type of reordering tolerated 
          by a streaming protocol varies from protocol to protocol, and 
          also by implementation. 
                      
          Packet loss does not affect the Out-of-order Packet count.  
          Only packets that were not received in the order that they 
          were transmitted.

     3.3.3 Duplicate Packet 
      
        Definition: 
          A received packet with a Test Sequence number matching a 
          previously received packet. 
      
        Discussion: 
          A Duplicate Packet is a packet that the DUT/SUT has 
          successfully transmitted out an egress interface more than 
          once.  The egress interface has previously forwarded this 
          packet. 
           
          A Duplicate Packet SHOULD be a bit for bit copy of an already 
          transmitted packet (including Test Sequence number).  If the 
          Duplicate Packet traversed different paths through the 
          DUT/SUT, some fields (such as TTL or checksum) may have 
          changed.

          A multicast packet is not a Duplicate Packet by definition.  
          For a given IP multicast group, a DUT/SUT SHOULD forward a 
          packet once on a given egress interface provided the path to 
          one or more multicast receivers is through that interface.  
          Several egress interfaces will transmit the same packet, but 
          only once per interface. 
           
          To detect a Duplicate Packet, each offered packet to the 
          DUT/SUT MUST contain a unique packet-by-packet identifier.

     3.3.4 Stream 
      
        Definition: 
          A group of packets tracked as a single entity by the traffic 
          receiver.  A stream may share a common content such as type 
          (IP, UDP), packet size, or payload. 
      
        Discussion: 
          Streams are tracked by test sequence number or "unique 
          signature field" [Ma00].  Streams define how individual 
          packets statistic are grouped together to form an 
          intelligible summary. 
           
          Common stream groupings would be by egress interface, 
          destination address, source address, DSCP, or IP precedence.  
          A stream using test sequence numbers can track the ordering 
          of packets as they transverse the DUT/SUT. 
           
          Streams are not restricted to a pair of source and 
          destination interfaces as long as all packets are tracked as 
          a single entity.  A multicast stream can be forwarded to 
          multiple destination interfaces.

     3.3.5 Test Sequence number 
      
        Definition: 
          A field in the IP payload portion of the packet that is used 
          to verify the order of the packets on the egress of the 
          DUT/SUT. 
      
        Discussion: 
          The traffic generator sets the test sequence number value and 
          the traffic receiver checks the value upon receipt of the 
          packet.  The traffic generator changes the value on each 
          packet transmitted based on an algorithm agreed to by the 
          traffic receiver. 
           
          The traffic receiver keeps track of the sequence numbers on a 
          per stream basis.  In addition to number of received packets, 
          the traffic receiver may also report the number of 
          in-sequence packets, number of out-of-sequence packets, 
          number of duplicate packets, and number of reordered packets. 
           
          The RECOMMENDED algorithm to use to change the sequence 
          number on sequential packets is an incrementing value.

     3.4 Vectors 
          A vector is a group of packets all containing a specific DSCP 
          or IP precedence value.  Vectors are expressed as a pair of 
          numbers.  The first is being the particular diff-serv value.  
          The second is the metric expressed as a rate, loss 
          percentage, Forwarding Delay, or Jitter.

          offered vectors and configuration of the DUT. 
      
        Discussion: 
          Instantaneous Jitter is the absolute value of the difference 
          between the Forwarding Delay measurement of two packets 
          belonging to the same stream. 
           
          The Forwarding Delay fluctuation between two consecutive 
          packets in a stream is reported as the "Instantaneous 
          Jitter".  Instantaneous Jitter can be expressed as 
          |D(i) - D(i-1)| where D equals the Forwarding Delay and i is 
          the test sequence number.  Packets lost are not counted in 
          the measurement. 
           
          Forwarding Vector may contain several Jitter Vectors.  For n 
          packets received in a Forwarding Vector, there is a total of 
          (n-1) Instantaneous Jitter Vectors.

          and configuration of the DUT. 
      
        Discussion: 
          Average Jitter Vector is the average of all the Instantaneous 
          Jitter Vectors measured during the test duration for the same

          Forwarding Delay of packet arrival times for packets having 
          a specific DSCP or IP precedence value.  The value is 
          dependent on the set of offered vectors and configuration 
          of the DUT. 
      
        Discussion: 
          Peak-to-peak Jitter Vector is the maximum Forwarding Delay 
          minus the minimum Forwarding Delay of the packets (in a 
          vector) forwarded by the DUT/SUT. 
           
          Peak-to-peak Jitter is not derived from the Instantaneous 
          Jitter Vector. Peak-to-peak Jitter is based upon all the 
          packets during the test duration, not just two consecutive 
          packets.

          interface in response to an offered vector. 
      
        Discussion: 
          Forwarding Vector is expressed as pair of numbers.  Both the 
          specific DSCP (or IP precedence) value AND the packets per 
          second value combine to make a vector. 
           
          The Forwarding Vector represents packet rate based on its

          may be expressed as per port of the DUT/SUT.  However, it 
          MUST be consistent with the Expected Forwarding Vector. 
           
          Forwarding Vector is a per-hop measurement.  The DUT/SUT may

          DUT/SUT may change the specific DSCP or IP precedence value 
          for a multiple-hop measurement.  Instantaneous Delay vector 
          can be obtained at any offered load.  It is RECOMMENDED to
          obtain this vector at or below the Forwarding Capacity in the 
          absence of Forwarding Congestion.  For congested Forwarding 
          Delay, run the offered load above the Forwarding Capacity.

          Forwarding Vector may contain several Instantaneous Delay 
          Vectors.  For every packet received in a Forwarding Vector, 
          there is a corresponding Instantaneous Delay Vector.

        Definition: 
          The average Forwarding Delay for packets containing a 
          specific DSCP or IP precedence value that a device can be 
          observed to successfully transmit to the correct 
          destination interface in response to an offered vector. 
      
        Discussion: 
          Average Delay vector is expressed as pair of numbers.  
          Both the specific DSCP (or IP precedence) value AND 
          Forwarding Delay value combine to make a vector. 
           
          The Delay Vector represents Forwarding Delay on its specific 
          DSCP or IP precedence value.  It is not necessarily based 
          on a stream or flow.  The Delay vector may be expressed as 
          per port of the DUT/SUT.  However, it MUST be consistent 
          with the Expect Delay vector. 
           
          The Average Delay Vector is computed by averaging all the 
          Instantaneous Delay Vectors for a given vector. 
           
          Average Delay Vector is a per-hop measurement.  The DUT/SUT 
          may change the specific DSCP or IP precedence value for a 
          multiple-hop measurement. 
           
          Average Delay vector can be obtained at any offered load.  
          Recommend at or below the Forwarding Capacity in the absence 
          of congestion.  For congested Forwarding Delay, run the 
          offered load above the Forwarding Capacity.

          specific DSCP or IP precedence value that a device can be 
          observed to successfully transmit to the correct destination 
          interface in response to an offered vector. 
      
        Discussion: 
          Maximum Delay vector is expressed as pair of numbers.  Both 
          the specific DSCP (or IP precedence) value AND Forwarding 
          Delay value combine to make a vector. 
           
          The Maximum Delay Vector represents Forwarding Delay on its 
          specific DSCP or IP precedence value.  It is not necessarily 
          based on a stream or flow.  The Maximum Delay vector may be

     3.4.4.7 Minimum Delay Vector 
      
        Definition: 
          The minimum Forwarding Delay from all packets containing a 
          specific DSCP or IP precedence value that a device can be 
          observed to successfully transmit to the correct destination 
          interface in response to an offered vector. 
      
        Discussion: 
          Delay vector is expressed as pair of numbers.  Both the 
          specific DSCP (or IP precedence) value AND Forwarding Delay 
          value combine to make a vector. 
           
          The Minimum Delay Vector represents Forwarding Delay on its 
          specific DSCP or IP precedence value.  It is not necessarily 
          based on a stream or flow.  The Minimum Delay vector may be 
          expressed as per port of the DUT/SUT.  However, it MUST be 
          consistent with the Expected Delay vector. 
           
          Minimum Delay Vector is based upon the minimum Instantaneous 
          Delay Vector of all packets in a Forwarding Vector. 
           
          Minimum Delay Vector is a per-hop measurement.  The DUT/SUT 
          may change the specific DSCP or IP precedence value for a 
          multiple-hop measurement. 
           
          Minimum Delay vector can be obtained at any offered load.  
          Recommend at or below the Forwarding Capacity in the absence

        Definition: 
          The jitter for two consecutive packets containing a specific 
          DSCP or IP precedence value that a device can be observed to 
          successfully transmit to the correct destination interface in 
          response to an offered vector.

                 Network-layer Traffic Control Mechanisms 
        
        Discussion: 
          Instantaneous Jitter is the absolute value of the difference 
          between the Forwarding Delay measurement of two packets 
          belonging to the same stream. 
           
          Jitter vector is expressed as pair of numbers.  Both the 
          specific DSCP (or IP precedence) value AND jitter value 
          combine to make a vector. 
           
          The Forwarding Delay fluctuation between two consecutive packets 
          in a stream is reported as the "Instantaneous Jitter".  
          Instantaneous Jitter Vector can be expressed as |D(i) - D(i-1)| 
          where D equals the Forwarding Delay and i is the test sequence 
          number.  Packets lost are not counted in the measurement. 
           
          Instantaneous Jitter Vector is a per-hop measurement.  The 
          DUT/SUT may change the specific DSCP or IP precedence value 
          for a multiple-hop measurement. 
           
          Forwarding Vector may contain several Instantaneous Jitter 
          Vectors.  For n packets received in a Forwarding Vector, 
          there are exactly (n-1) Instantaneous Jitter Vectors.

     3.4.4.9 Average Jitter Vector 
      
        Definition: 
          The average jitter for packets containing a specific DSCP or 
          IP precedence value that a device can be observed to 
          successfully transmit to the correct destination interface in 
          response to an offered vector. 
      
        Discussion: 
          Average Jitter Vector is the average of all the Instantaneous 
          Jitter Vectors of the same DSCP or IP precedence value, 
          measured during the test duration. 
           
          Average Jitter vector is expressed as pair of numbers.  Both 
          the specific DSCP (or IP precedence) value AND jitter value 
          combine to make a vector.

          Average Jitter vector is a per-hop measurement.  The DUT/SUT

     3.4.4.10 Peak-to-peak Jitter Vector 
      
        Definition: 
          The maximum possible variation in the Forwarding Delay for 
          packets containing a specific DSCP or IP precedence value 
          that a device can be observed to successfully transmit to 
          the correct destination interface in response to an 
          offered vector. 
      
        Discussion: 
          Peak-to-peak Jitter Vector is the maximum Forwarding Delay 
          minus the minimum Forwarding Delay of the packets (in a 
          vector) forwarded by the DUT/SUT. 
           
          Jitter vector is expressed as pair of numbers.  Both the 
          specific DSCP (or IP precedence) value AND jitter value 
          combine to make a vector. 
           
          Peak-to-peak Jitter is not derived from the Instantaneous 
          Jitter Vector.  Peak-to-peak Jitter is based upon all the 
          packets during the test duration, not just two consecutive 
          packets.

4. IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA considerations.


5. Security Considerations 
           
          Documents of this type do not directly affect the security of 
          the Internet or of corporate networks as long as benchmarking 
          is not performed on devices or systems connected to 
          production networks. 
           
          Packets with unintended and/or unauthorized DSCP or IP 
          precedence values may present security issues.  Determining 
          the security consequences of such packets is out of scope for 
          this document.
