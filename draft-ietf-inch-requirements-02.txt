     Abstract 
         
        The purpose of the Format for INcident report Exchange (FINE) is to 
        facilitate the exchange of incident information and statistics among 
        responsible Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) and 
        involved parties for reactionary analysis of current intruder 
        activity and proactive identification of trends that can lead to 
        incident prevention.  A common and well-defined format will help in 
        exchanging Incident related information across organizations, regions 
        and countries.

     1. Introduction 
      
        Computer security incidents occur across administrative domains often 
        spanning different organizations and national borders. Therefore, the 
        exchange of incident information and statistics among involved 
        parties and the responsible Computer Security Incident Response Teams 
        (CSIRTs) is crucial for both reactionary analysis of current intruder 
        activity and proactive identification of trends that can lead to 
        incident prevention.  
         
        In the following we refer to the information pertaining to an 
        incident as an Incident Report.  
         
        Definition of a common well defined format to Incident Reports will 
        facilitate incident related information exchange across organizations, 
        regions and countries by achieving these particular goals: 
        +  to make the semantics of the report as clear and unambiguous as 
           possible, intended for use across organizational, regional and 
           national boundaries; 
        + to ensure that the report (or parts of it) has a well defined 
           syntax; 
        + to ensure that the structure of the report allows easy 
           categorization and statistical analysis; 
        + to ensure the verifiability of the integrity of the report, a the 
           authenticity of the report source.

     INTERNET DRAFT            FINE Requirements             October, 2003 

         
        This document defines the high-level functional requirements of a 
        Format for INcident report Exchange (FINE).  
         
         
     2. Incident Handling Framework 
         
        2.1. Incident Description Terms 
         
        For the purpose of clarify, certain commonly used terms from the 
        operational domain of CSIRTs are defined here. These are based on 
        related documents [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]  
         
        2.1.1. Attack 
         
        One or more steps taken by an attacker to achieve an unauthorised result. 
         
        An Attack can be active, passive. An attack may be successful.  
         
        2.1.2. Attacker 
         
        Attacker is an entity that attempts one or more attacks. 
         
        An attacker may be an insider, an outsider, or an entity acting via 
        an attack mediator. For the purpose of FINE, an attacker is described 
        by the computer/network ID, from which the attack was launched. The 
        organization name and/or physical location of the computer/network 
        are used as additional information. 
         
        2.1.3. CSIRT 
         
        CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team) is a team that 
        coordinates and supports the response to security incidents that 
        involve sites within a defined constituency [7]. The CSIRT generates, 
        processes and maintains incident reports. 
         
        2.1.4. Damage 
         
        The intended or unintended consequence of an attack. Description of 
        damage may include a free text description of the actual result of an 
        attack, and, where possible, structured information about the 
        particular damaged system, subsystem or service. 
         
        2.1.5. Event 
         
        An occurrence in a system or network, which maybe of interest and/or 
        warrants attention. An event may indicate an attack. An event may 
        also indicate an error or a fault or the result of a deliberate act 
        that is not an attack. For example, the occurrence of three failed 
        logins in 10 seconds is an event. It might indicate a brute- force 
        login attack. A program failure, network fault, system shutdown are 
        other examples of event.

     INTERNET DRAFT            FINE Requirements             October, 2003 

        2.1.6. Impact 
         
        Impact describes the result of an attack expressed in terms of user 
        community, for example the cost in terms of financial or other 
        disruption 
         
        2.1.7. Computer/Network Security Incident 
         
        A Computer/Network Security Incident, referred to as incident in this 
        work, is a set of one or more events. The events in the incident may 
        indicate attacks. There may be incidents which comprise of events 
        which are not indicative of attacks.  
         
        Typical computer security incidents are: a computer intrusion, a 
        denial-of-service attack, information theft or data manipulation, etc. 
         
        2.1.8. Incident Report 
         
        In this document an Incident Report refers to the information 
        pertaining to an incident. In practice, an Incident Report may have 
        some internal proprietary format that is adapted to the local 
        Incident Handling System (IHS) and Incident handling procedures.  
         
        Definition of the requirements to the format for Incident Report 
        exchange is the subject of this document. 
         
        2.1.9. Source 
         
        The source of an attack. This can be a logical entity (e.g. a user 
        account, a computer process or data, a logical network or 
        internetwork) or a physical entity (e.g. a computer interface, a  
        router etc.). 
         
         
        2.1.10. Target 
         
        The target of an attack. This can be a logical entity( e.g. a user 
        account, a computer process or data, a logical network or 
        internetwork) or a physical entity, e.g. (a computer interface, a  
        router etc.) 
         
        2.1.11. Victim 
         
        The entity which suffered the attack. For the purpose of FINE a 
        victim is described by its network ID, organization and location 
        information. 
         
        2.1.12. Other terms 
         
        Other terms used: alert, activity, IDS, Security Policy, etc., - are 
        defined in related I-Ds, RFCs, standards and documents[2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 
        9, 10].

     INTERNET DRAFT            FINE Requirements             October, 2003 

         
        2.2 The Operational Model 
         
        Incident Reports are generated, received and updated. For example, An 
        organization may send an Incident Report to a CSIRT when an attack 
        has been detected. Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) 
        receive Incident Reports from customers, or from other CSIRTs. The 
        CSIRTs maintain these reports. They may process the reports to 
        generate statistics, or investigate the Incident further. As part of 
        the investigation, or as part of the reporting the CSIRT may forward 
        the Incident Report or parts of it to other CSIRTs. The CSIRTs may 
        also receive results of investigation, or additional information 
        related to currently active Incident from other CSIRTs.  
         
        These operations are shown in fig. 1

        From the operational point of view during the life-cycle of an 
        Incident Report the following may apply: 
        + the report itself evolves. It may exist in one of the following 
           states:  
           - handling – the Incident Report is being handled 
           - complete/closed - the Incident Report is not being processed and 
           no processing is planned 
           - waiting - the Incident Report is waiting on some event; 
          
        + the report is exchanged between CSIRTs and may be 
           investigated/processed by multiple CSIRTs, simultaneously;

        + additions and/or changes to the report may be effected by one or 
           more CSIRTs. So a single CSIRT may not be in a position to vouch 
           for the veracity of all parts of the Incident Report, 
         
      
     3. The Goal. This section is eliminated but left as a placeholder until 
     final review 
         
     4. General Requirements 
      
        4.1 The definition of the Format for INcident Report Exchange (FINE) 
        shall reference and use previously published RFCs where possible. 
      
     5. Format Requirements 
         
        5.1 FINE shall support full internationalization and localization. 
         
        A significant part of the Incident Report will comprise of human-
        readable text. Since some Incidents need involvement of CSIRTs from 
        different countries and geographic regions, FINE must have provisions 
        so that the Incident Report can be presented in the local language in 
        accordance with local rules and conventions.  
         
        FINE must have provisions to specify the naming rules and conventions 
        that have been applied in the Incident Report.  
         
        In cases where the messages contain text strings and names that need 
        characters other than Latin-1 (or ISO 8859-1), the information should 
        preferably be represented using the ISO/IEC IS 10646-1 character set 
        and encoded using the UTF-8 transformation format, and optionally 
        using local character sets and encodings. 
         
        In cases where local (non-standard) character sets and encodings are 
        used, the elements that carry encoding sensitive information should 
        be clearly indicated. It should be possible to preserve the content 
        of these elements when transferring an Incident Report. 
         
        5.2 FINE must support aggregation and filtering of Incident Report 
        data. 
         
        The format of FINE must be structured with components that have a 
        well-defined syntax and semantics. 
         
        5.3 FINE must provide the possibility for recording the evolution of 
        an Incident Report during its lifetime.  
         
        An Incident Report may evolve with time. As investigation proceeds, 
        it is likely that more information about an incident will be revealed 
        and parts of the earlier information will be modified/deleted.  FINE 
        must support the recording of these changes.  changes with the level 
        of details defined by internal/adopted Incident Handling procedure.

     INTERNET DRAFT            FINE Requirements             October, 2003 

        5.4 FINE must support the application of an access restriction policy 
        to individual components of the Incident Report. 
         
        Various parts of an Incident Report will have information of varying 
        degrees of sensitivity and will need to be handled with the  
        appropriate level of confidentiality. It must be possible to specify 
        the degree of confidentiality for the individual components of the 
        Incident Report. Applications can then implement different levels of 
        access restrictions, for the different components of the Incident 
        Report. 
         
         
        5.5 FINE must support globally unique identifiers for the exchanged 
        Incident reports.  
         
        It should be possible to refer to an Incident Report unambiguously 
        using the globally unique identifier. It should also be possible to 
        map the origin/creator of an Incident Report from its globally unique 
        identifier. 
         
        5.6. FINE must have a well defined semantics and provide a standard 
        way for extensibility in terms of addition of components and/or 
        extending the components. 
         
        5.7. FINE must allow multilingual reports. In case there are multiple 
        language versions of a component of the report, the versions should 
        be consistent and, and FINE must provide a way to identify which 
        version is authentic. 
         
        An Incident Report may be multilingual, i.e. different parts of the 
        Incident Report may use different languages. It is also possible that 
        multiple versions of parts of the report exist, each version in a 
        different language. The versions may not be consistent. 
         
         
     6. Communication Mechanisms Requirements 
         
        6.1 The communication mechanisms must have no bearing on the 
        authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of a FINE formatted 
        Incident Report. Provisions for authenticity, integrity and 
        confidentiality should be made in FINE. 
         
        Incident Report exchange will normally be conducted using standard 
        communication protocols and exchange mechanisms, for example, e-mail, 
        HTTP, FTP, XML Web Services, etc. FINE must not rely on communication 
        mechanisms or specific applications to ensure authenticity, integrity 
        and/or confidentiality of an Incident Report.  
         
         
     7. Content Requirements  
         
        7.1 FINE must be flexible enough to support various degrees of 
        completeness. At the same time it must clearly state the minimal 
      
     Expires April 2004                                           [Page 7] 
      
     INTERNET DRAFT            FINE Requirements             October, 2003 

        information without which the information in the Incident Report will 
        be seriously degraded. 
         
        7.2 FINE must contain information about the various entities involved 
        in the incident. An Incident Report will generally refer to one or 
        more entities. The entity may be the attacker, perpetrator, victim, 
        or an observer. 
         
        7.3 FINE should support the description of various aspects/details of 
        the entities involved in the incident. There may be several facets of 
        an entity involved in an Incident Report. The entity may have zero or 
        more network addresses and names as well as zero or more location 
        names, organizational names, person names, machine names etc.. 
         
        7.4 FINE should contain the description of the method how the attack 
        or security event was conducted if it is known. 
         
        Well-known classification/enumeration schemes should be used to 
        describe the type of attack or vulnerabilities and exposures caused 
        particular Incident or security Event.  
         
        7.5 FINE must include the identity of the creator of the Incident 
        Report (CSIRT or other authority). FINE should indicate the source of 
        each component of the Incident Report if it’s different from the 
        creator. 
         
        The source of a component of the Incident Report may be the creator 
        of the Incident Report, the team handling the incident or, some other 
        party.  
         
        7.6 FINE should provide the possibility to include or reference 
        additional detailed information/data external to report. 
         
        This information may include IDMEF [5] messages, which have been 
        generated by security devices. 
         
        7.7 FINE may contain a natural language description of the Incident 
        or related security events. 
         
        7.8 FINE should contain references to the appropriate advisories, 
        wherever applicable, corresponding to the related events , e.g. 
        CERT/CC, CVE, etc. 
         
        7.9 FINE should provide the possibility for describing the impact of 
        an incident.  
        There should be guidelines to describe the impact on the target 
        to ensure a uniform interpretation of the description. 
         
        7.10 The Incident Report should describe the actions taken since the 
        occurrence of the incident. 
         
        7.11 Time shall be reported as the local time and time zone offset 
        from UTC.  (Note: See RFC 1902 for guidelines on reporting time.) 
      
     Expires April 2004                                           [Page 8] 
      
     INTERNET DRAFT            FINE Requirements             October, 2003 

         
        Internal Incident Report may contain local presentation of time 
        related information, however FINE must support unambiguous time 
        specification. In case when normalization of the time information is 
        not possible (like in case of referencing additional data about the 
        Incident that cannot be changed, e.g. time-stamped log data), the 
        time offset should be mentioned. 
         
        7.12 FINE will not have any specific requirement for granularity of 
        time. 
         
        Different systems will support different time granularities. FINE 
        should be able to support Incident Reports from various systems 
        irrespective of their time granularity. 
         
        7.13 FINE should allow the application of external mechanisms to 
        support authenticity, integrity and non-repudiation checks of 
        Incident Reports. 
         
         
         
     8. Security Considerations 
         
        This memo does not describe a protocol by itself. This memo describes 
        the requirements for an Incident Report Exchange Format. The reports 
        themselves are about security incidents. The contents of the Incident 
        Reports will have significant direct and/or indirect impact on the 
        security and privacy of a network and/or individuals. FINE 
        implementers should take care to analyze and implement the 
        requirements regarding access restriction policy as stated in 5.4 and 
        requirements regarding support of external mechanisms for 
        authenticity, integrity and non-repudiation 7.13.
