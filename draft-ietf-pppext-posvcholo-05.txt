Abstract

   The RFC 1661 Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard
   method for transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point
   links. The RFC 1662 PPP in HDLC-like Framing [2] and RFC 2615 PPP
   over SONET/SDH (POS) [3] documents describe the use of PPP over
   Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) and Synchronous Digital
   Hierarchy (SDH) circuits.

   This document describes an extension to the mapping of PPP into
   SONET/SDH defined in RFC 2615 PPP over SONET/SDH (POS) [3], to
   include use of SONET/SDH SPE/VC virtual concatenation and use of
   both high order and low order payloads.

   This document is the product of the Point-to-Point Protocol
   Extensions Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF). Comments should be submitted to the ietf-ppp@merit.edu
   mailing list.

1. Introduction

   Current implementations of PPP over SONET/SDH are required to select
   transport structures from the relatively limited number of
   contiguously concatenated signals that are available

   The only currently supported SONET/SDH SPE/VCs in RFC 2615 [3] are
   the following:

          SONET                   SDH
      ----------------------------------------
      STS-3c-SPE                  VC-4
      STS-12c-SPE                 VC-4-4c
      STS-48c-SPE                 VC-4-16c
      STS-192c-SPE                VC-4-64c

   Note that VC-4-4c and above are not widely supported in SDH networks
   at present.

   The use of virtual concatenation means that the right size SONET/SDH
   bandwidth can be selected for PPP links.

   For the convenience of the reader, the equivalent terms are listed
   below:

          SONET                   SDH
      ---------------------------------------------
      SPE                         VC
      VT (1.5/2/6)                Low order VC (VC-11/12/2)
      STS SPE                     Higher Order VC (VC-3/4/4-Nc)
      STS-1 frame                 STM-0 frame (rarely used)
      STS-1 SPE                   VC-3
      STS-1-nv                    VC-3-nv (virtual concatenation)
      STS-1 payload               C-3
      STS-3c frame                STM-1 frame, AU-4
      STS-3c SPE                  VC-4
      STS-3c-nv                   VC-4-nv (virtual concatenation)
      STS-3c payload              C-4
      STS-12c/48c/192c frame      STM-4/16/64 frame, AU-4-4c/16c/64c
      STS-12c/48c/192c-SPE        VC-4-4c/16c/64c
      STS-12c/48c/192c payload    C-4-4c/16c/64c

   This table is an extended version of the equivalent table in RFC
   2615 [3]. Additional information on the above terms can be found in
   Bellcore GR-253-CORE [4], ANSI T1.105 [5], ANSI T1.105.02 [6] and
   ITU-T G.707 [7].

2. Rate Comparisons

   Currently supported WAN bandwidth links for PPP over SONET/SDH:

        ANSI                   ETSI
     -----------------------------------------------------
       STS-3c (150Mbit/s)     STM-1 (150Mbit/s)
       STS-12c (620Mbit/s)    STM-4 AU-4-4c (620Mbit/s)
       STS-48c (2.4Gbit/s)    STM-16 AU-4-16c (2.4Gbit/s)
       STS-192c (9.6Gbit/s)   STM-64 AU-4-64c (9.6Gbit/s)

   Note that AU-4-4c and AU-4-16c are not generally available in SDH
   networks at present.

   With virtual concatenation the following additional WAN bandwidth
   links would be available for PPP over SONET/SDH:

         SONET

       VT-1.5-nv (n=3D1-64)       1.6Mbit/s-102Mbit/s
       STS-1-nv  (n=3D1-64)       49Mbit/s-3.1Gbit/s
       STS-3c-nv (n=3D1-64)       150Mbit/s-10Gbit/s

         SDH

       VC-12-nv (n=3D1-64)        2.2Mbit/s-139Mbit/s
       VC-3-nv  (n=3D1-64)        49Mbit/s-3.1Gbit/s
       VC-4-nv  (n=3D1-64)        150Mbit/s-10Gbit/s

   Higher levels of virtual concatenation are possible, but not
   necessarily useful. Lower levels of virtual concatenation are
   defined in the telecommunications standards for use if needed.

   Table 1 and Table 2,respectively depict the SONET/SDH transport
   structures that are currently available to carry various popular bit
   rates. Each table contains three columns. The first column shows the
   bit rates of the service to be transported.

   The next column contains two values:

   a) the logical signals that are currently available to provide such
   transport and, b) in parenthesis, the percent efficiency of the
   given transport signal without the use of virtual concatenation.

   Likewise, the final column also contains two values:

   a) the logical signals that are currently available to provide such
   transport and, b) in parenthesis, the percent efficiency of the
   given transport signal with the use of virtual concatenation.

   Note, that Table 1, contains SONET transport signals with the
   following effective payload capacity: VT-1.5 SPE =3D 1.600 Mbit/s,
   STS-1 SPE =3D 49.536 Mbit/s, STS-3c SPE =3D 149.760 Mbit/s, STS-12c =
SPE
   =3D 599.040 Mbit/s, STS-48c SPE =3D 2,396.160 Mbit/s and STS-192c =
SPE =3D
   9,584.640 Mbit/s.

        Table 1. SONET Virtual Concatenation

      Bit rate     Without            With
     --------------------------------------------

      10Mbit/s    STS-1 (20%)   VT-1.5-7v (89%)
      100Mbit/s   STS-3c (67%)  STS-1-2v (100%)
      200Mbit/s   STS-12c(33%)  STS-1-4v (100%)
      1Gbit/s     STS-48c(42%)  STS-3c-7v (95%)

   Similarly, Table 2, contains SDH transport signals with the
   following effective payload capacity: VC-12 =3D 2.176 Mbit/s,
   VC-3 =3D 48.960 Mbit/s, VC-4 =3D 149.760 Mbit/s, VC-4-4c =3D 599.040
   Mbit/s, VC-4-16c =3D 2,396.160 Mbit/s and VC-4-64c =3D 9,584.640 =
Mbit/s.

        Table 2. SDH Virtual Concatenation

      Bit rate     Without            With
     -------------------------------------------

      10Mbit/s    VC-3 (20%)    VC-12-5v (92%)
      100Mbit/s   VC-4 (67%)    VC-3-2v (100%)
      200Mbit/s   VC-4-4c(33%)  VC-3-4v (100%)
      1Gbit/s     VC-4-16c(42%) VC-4-7v (95%)


3. Physical Layer Requirements

   There are two minor modifications to the physical layer requirements
   as defined in RFC 2615 when virtually concatenated SPEs/VCs are used
   to provide transport for PPP over SONET/SDH.

   First, the path signal label (C2 byte) value for SONET/SDH STS-1/VC-
   3 and above SPE/VCs is required to be the same for all constituent
   channels. This is in contrast to the use of a single C2 byte for PPP
   transport over contiguously concatenated SONET/SDH SPE/VCs. The
   values used for the C2 bytes should be in accordance with RFC 2615.
   For SONET VT-1.5/2/6 and SDH VC-11/12/2 the path signal label (V5
   byte bits 5-7) is required to be the same for all constituent
   channels per ITU-T G.707 [7] and ANSI T1.105.02 [6].

   Second, for SONET/SDH STS-1/VC-3 and above SPE/VCs the multi-frame
   indicator (H4) byte will be unused for transport links utilizing
   contiguously concatenated SONET/SDH SPE/VCs. When the concatenation
   scheme is virtual as opposed to contiguous the H4 byte must be
   populated as per ITU-T G.707 or T1.105.02. Similarly, for virtual
   concatenation based on SONET VT-1.5/2/6 and SDH VC-11/12/2 channels

   bit 2 of the path overhead K4 byte will be set to the value
   indicated per ITU-T G.707 [7] and ANSI T1.105.02 [6].

4. Standards Status

   ITU-T (SG13/SG15), ANSI T1X1 and ETSI TM1/WP3 have developed a
   global standard for SONET/SDH High Order and Low Order payload
   Virtual Concatenation. This standard is defined in the following
   documents:

        ITU-T G.803 Architecture of transport networks based on the
        synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH)

        ITU-T G.707 Network Node Interface for the Synchronous Digital
        Hierarchy (SDH)

        ITU-T G.783 Characteristics of Synchronous Digital Hierarchy
        (SDH) Equipment Functional Blocks

        ANSI T1.105 Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) - Basic
        Description including Multiplex Structure, Rates and Formats

        ANSI T1.105.02 Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) - Payload
        Mappings

        ETSI EN 300 417-9-1 Transmission and Multiplexing (TM) Generic
        requirements of transport functionality of equipment Part 9:
        Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) concatenated path layer
        functions. Subpart 1: Requirements

   Work in ITU-T, ANSI T1X1 and ETSI TM1/WP3 has ensured global
   standards alignment.

   With the completion of a standard for SONET/SDH SPE/VC virtual
   concatenation it is appropriate to document the use of this standard
   for PPP transport over SONET/SDH, which is the intent of this
   document.

5. Security Considerations

   The security discussion in RFC 2615 also applies to this document.
   No new security features have been explicitly introduced or removed
   compared to RFC 2615.
