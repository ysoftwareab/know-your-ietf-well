Abstract

   This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) profile
   for a general purpose listing of checksums (a 'checklist'), for use
   with the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  The objective is
   to allow an attestation, in the form of a listing of one or more
   checksums of arbitrary digital objects (files), to be signed "with
   resources", and for validation to provide a means to confirm a
   specific Internet Resource Holder produced the signed checklist.  The
   profile is intended to provide for the signing of a checksum listing
   with an arbitrary set of Internet Number Resources.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [RFC5652]
   profile for a general purpose listing of checksums (a 'checklist'),
   for use with the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) [RFC6480].
   The objective is to allow an attestation, in the form of a listing of
   one or more checksums of arbitrary files, to be signed "with
   resources", and for validation to provide a means to confirm a given
   Internet Resource Holder produced the RPKI Signed Checklist (RSC).

Internet-Draft           RPKI Signed Checklists            February 2021


   The profile is intended to provide for the signing of a checksum
   listing with an arbitrary set of Internet Number Resources.

   RSC files are expected to facilitate Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP)
   authentication, inter-domain interconnection provisioning, and
   resource holdership verification processes.

   The RSC concept borrows heavily from RTA [I-D.ietf-sidrops-rpki-rta],
   Manifests [RFC6486], and OpenBSD's [signify] utility.  The main
   difference between RSC and RTA is that an RTA enables multiple
   signers to attest a single anonymous digital object through a
   checksum of its content, while an RSC allows a single signer to
   attest the checksums of multiple named digital objects.  This
   difference is expected to represent a simplification for implementers
   and operators.

2.  RSC Profile and Distribution

   RSC follows the Signed Object Template for the RPKI [RFC6488] with
   one exception.  Because RSCs MUST NOT be distributed through the
   global RPKI repository system, the Subject Information Access (SIA)
   extension is omitted from the RSC's X.509 EE certificate.

   What constitutes suitable transport for RSC files is deliberately
   unspecified.  It might be a USB stick, a web interface secured with
   conventional HTTPS, PGP-signed email, a T-shirt printed with a QR
   code, or a carrier pigeon.

3.  The RSC ContentType

   The ContentType for an RSC is defined as rpkiSignedChecklist, and has
   the numerical value of 1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.TBD.

   This OID MUST appear both within the eContentType in the
   encapContentInfo object as well as the ContentType signed attribute
   in the signerInfo object (see [RFC6488]).

4.  The RSC eContent

   The content of an RSC indicates that an a checklist for arbitrary
   named digital objects has been signed "with resources".  An RSC is
   formally defined as:

      RpkiSignedChecklist-2021
        { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549)
          pkcs(1) pkcs9(9) smime(16) mod(0) TBD }

      DEFINITIONS EXPLICIT TAGS ::=

4.1.  version

   The version number of the RpkiSignedChecklist MUST be 0.

4.2.  resources

   The resources contained here are the resources used to mark the
   attestation, and MUST match the set of resources listed by the EE
   certificate carried in the CMS certificates field.

4.3.  digestAlgorithm

   The digest algorithm used to create the message digest of the
   attested digital object.  This algorithm MUST be a hashing algorithm
   defined in [RFC7935].

4.4.  checkList

   This field is a sequence of FileAndHash objects.  There is one
   FileAndHash entry for each arbitrary object referenced from the RSC.
   Each FileAndHash is an ordered pair consisting of the name of the
   file that contains the object in question and a hash of the file's
   contents.

5.  RSC Validation

   To validate an RSC the relying party MUST perform all the validation
   checks specified in [RFC6488] as well as the following additional
   RSC-specific validation steps.

   o  The message digest of each by filename referenced digital object,
      using the digest algorithm specified in the the digestAlgorithm
      field, MUST be calculated and MUST match the value given in the
      messageDigest field of the RSC content.

6.  Security Considerations

   Relying parties are hereby warned that the data in a RPKI Signed
   Checklist is self-asserted.  These data have not been verified by the
   CA that issued the CA certificate to the entity that issued the EE
   certificate used to validate the Signed Checklist.

7.  Implementation status - RFC EDITOR: REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC 7942.
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to

   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to RFC 7942, "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

   o  A validator implementation based on OpenBSD's rpki-client is
      expected to be published after IANA Early Allocation of the OIDs.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  OID

   The IANA has registered the OID for the RPKI Signed Checklist in the
   registry created by [RFC6488] as follows:

      Name          OID                          Specification
      ---------------------------------------------------------
      Checklists    1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.TBD  [RFC-TBD]

8.2.  File Extension

   The IANA has added an item for the signed Checklist file extension to
   the "RPKI Repository Name Scheme" created by [RFC6481] as follows:

      Filename Extension  RPKI Object           Reference
      -----------------------------------------------------------
         .sig             Signed Checklist      [RFC-TBD]

8.3.  Media Type

   The IANA has registered the media type application/rpki-checklist as
   follows:
