1. Introduction 
    
   The intention of this I-D is to initiate the discussion on especially 
   accounting issues related to well-managed IP multicasting services 
   and to invite people to participate a potential IETF BoF/WG to 
   discuss these issues and find solutions for them. 
    
   IP multicasting is becoming widely used as a method to save network 
   resources such as bandwidth or CPU processing power at senderÙs 
   server for the cases where large volume of information needs to be 
   distributed to a large number of receivers.  This trend can be 
   observed both in enterprise use and in broadband services provided by 
   network operator/service providers. 
    
   Distance learning within a university and in-house (in-company) 
   multimedia information sharing are examples of enterprise use.  In 
   these examples, sources generate high bit rate (e.g., 6Mbit/s) 
   streaming information.  When the number of receivers becomes large, 
   the system to share this type of information does not scale well 
   without multicasting. 
    
   On the other hand, content delivery service (CDS) is an example of 
   broadband services provided by network operator/service providers.  
   Distribution of movies and other video programs to each user are 
   typical services.  Each channel requires large bandwidth (e.g., 
   6Mbit/s) and operator/service providers need to provide many channels

   Internet Draft        draft-hayashi-maccnt-00         February, 2005 
    
    
   to make their service attractive.  In addition, the number of 
   receivers is large (e.g., more than a few thousands).  The system to 
   provide this service does not scale well without multicasting. 
    
   As such, multicasting can be useful to make the network more scalable 
   when large volume of information needs to be distributed to a large 
   number of receivers.  However, multicasting according to current 
   standard has drawbacks compared to unicasting.  Appropriate 
   accounting of each user is not possible when multicasting is used 
   while it is possible under unicasting.  Accounting consists of 
   grasping each user's behavior, when she/he starts/stops to receive a 
   channel, which channel she/he receives, etc. 
    
   Although multicasting has already been used in several applications, 
   it is used in such a way that accounting is not necessary.  When 
   accounting capabilities are necessary, unicasting is used instead of 
   multicasting although a lot of network resources (e.g., bandwidth, 
   CPU processing power, etc.) could be saved with multicasting in some 
   applications.  If multicasting can be used with appropriate 
   accounting capabilities, its applicability would be widen much. 
    
   This I-D first describes problems on accounting issues in 
   multicasting.  Then the requirements for accounting capabilities are 
   listed.  Finally, an application example which could benefit from 
   multicasting with accounting capabilities is shown.  It is proposed 
   that this I-D be used as a starting point of the discussion on these 
   issues. 
    
    
2. Problem statement 
    
   In unicast communications, server (information source) can identify 
   the client (information receiver) and permits connection only if the 
   client is eligible when this type of checking is necessary.  In 
   addition, when necessary, the server can grasp what the client is 
   doing (e.g., connecting to the server, starts reception, what 
   information is the client receiving, terminates reception, 
   disconnects from the server). 
    
   On the other hand, in multicast communication as in Fig.1, the server 
   just feeds its information to the multicast router.  Then, multicast 
   router replicates the information to distribute the clients.  
   According to the current standard (e.g., IGMPv3[1] or MLDv2[2]), the 
   multicast router feeds the replicated information to any link which 
   has at least one client requesting the information.  In this process, 
   no eligibility check is conducted.  Any client can request to receive 
   the information.  In other words, no accounting capabilities are 
   provided for multicasting by the current standard.

             Fig.1 Example network for multicast communication 
    
   This is the major reason why multicasting is only used for the cases 
   where no accounting capabilities are necessary.  However, it can 
   easily be envisaged that multicasting is required to be applied to 
   communications which need accounting capabilities because more and 
   more information is transferred over the IP-based networks and some 
   of them may require accounting capabilities.  For example, if one 
   want to charge for distributed information, accounting is needed.  If 
   the volume of information and number of client are large, it is 
   beneficial to use multicasting from the network resource efficiency 
   point of view. 
    
   As such, same level of accounting capabilities as unicast networks 
   should be provided to multicast networks. 
    
    
3. Functional general requirements for well managed multicasting 
    
   To realize well managed multicasting, following capabilities are 
   required: 
    
   (1) Network should be able to identify each client when eligible user 
      access, and should be able to reject to connect ineligible 
      clients. 
    
   (2) Network can grasp each client's behavior.  For example, network 
      should be able to detect: 
    
     - that the client connects to the network, 
     - that the client starts receiving certain information, 
     - that the information which the client is receiving, 
     - that the client terminates receiving the information, 
     - that the client disconnects from the network. 
    
   (3) Mobility functions should be supported as an option so that users 
      can use the service from anywhere.

   (4) Both ASM (G), and SSM (S,G) should be supported as multicast 
      models. 
    
   Specific functional requirements for each application can be derived 
   from above general requirements.  An example is shown in the 
   following section. 
    
    
4. Application example and its specific requirements 
    
   This section shows an application example which can get benefit from 
   multicasting.  Then, specific functional requirements related to 
   accounting capabilities are derived. 
    
    
4.1 IP Multicast-based Content Delivery Service (CDS) 
 
   Broadband access networks such as ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber 
   Line) or FTTH (Fiber to the Home) have been deployed widely in recent 
   years. Content delivery service (CDS) is expected to be a major 
   application provided through broadband access networks. Because many 
   services like TV broadcasting require huge bandwidth (e.g., 6Mbit/s) 
   and processing power at content server, IP multicast is used as an 
   efficient delivery mechanism for CDS.  
    
   One way to provide high quality CDS is to use closed networks 
   ("walled-garden" model). 
    
 
4.1.1 Network model for Multicast Content Delivery Service 
    
   As shown in Fig.2, networks for CDS contain three different types of 
   entities: Content Owners (COs), Network Service Provider (NSP), and 
   end user clients. An NSP owns the network resources (infrastructure). 
   It accommodates content owners on one side and accommodates end user 
   clients on the other side. NSP provides the network for CDS to other 
   two entities (i.e., COs and end user clients). A CO provides content 
   to each end user client through the network of NSPs. NSPs are 
   responsible for delivering the content to end user clients, and for 
   controlling the network resources.

                Fig.2 Example of CDN network configuration 
                                                                        
   NSP has the information server for all multicast channels, and a CO 
   gives detail channel information (e.g., Time table of each channel) 
   to the information server. An end user client gets the information 
   from the information server. In this model, multicast is used in the 
   NSP's CDN, and there are two different contracts. One is the contract 
   between NSP and end user to permit user to access a basic network 
   resources of NSP.  Another one is between CO and end user to permit 
   user to subscribe multicast content. Because CO and NSP are different 
   entities and in general, NSP does not allow a CO to control (operate) 
   the network resources of NSP, a user authorization needs to be done 
   by CO and NSP independently. Since there is no direct connection to 
   the user/network interface, CO cannot control the user/network 
   interface. An end user may want to move to other place, or may want 
   to change her/his device (client) anytime without interrupting 
   her/his receiving services.  As such, IP Multicast network should 
   support mobility capabilities.

4.1.2 Content Delivery Service Requirements 
 
   To have a successful business, there are some specific requirements 
   for the IP Multicast-based content delivery service. 
 
4.1.2.1 Accounting Requirements 
    
   Since CO and NSP are different business entities, they need to share 
   the profit. Such profit sharing business relationship requires 
   accurate and near real-time accounting information about the end user 
   clientsÙ activity on accessing the content services. The accounting 
   information should be per content/usage base to enable different 
   billing and charging methods. 
    
   The user accessing a particular content is represented by the userÙs 
   activities of joining or leaving the corresponding multicast 
   group/channel (<g> or <s,g>). In multicast networks, only NSPs can 
   collect group joining or leaving activities through theirs last-hop 
   multicast access edge devices in real-time. The NSPs can transfer the 
   accounting information to related COs for them to generate final end 
   user billing information. The normal AAA technology can be used to 
   transfer the accounting information. 
    
   To match the accounting information with a particular end user client, 
   the end user client has to be authenticated. Usually the account 
   information of an end user client for content access is maintained by 
   the COs. An end user client may have different user accounts for 
   different COs. The account is usually in the format of (username, 
   password) so an end user client can access the content services from 
   anywhere. For example, an end user client can access the CO from 
   different NSPs. It should be noted that the user account used for 
   content access can be different from the one used for network access 
   maintained by NSPs. 
    
   The NSP-CO model represents multi-domain AAA environment. There are 
   plural cases of the model depending on trust relationship between NSP 
   and CO, and additional service requirement such as QoS for NSP or 
   ubiquitous for users. 
    
   A mechanism is necessary to allow CO and NSP to grasp each user's 
   behavior independently. 
    
4.1.2.2 Authorization Requirements 
    
  The NSPs are responsible for delivering the content and are required 
  to meet certain QoS level or SLA (service level agreements). For 
  example, video quality is very sensitive to packet losses. So if a 
  NSP cannot meet the quality requirements due to limited network 
  resources if it receives an additional user request, the NSP should 
    
    
    
   Hayashi, He, Satou, Ohta                                   [Page 7] 

   Internet Draft        draft-hayashi-maccnt-00         February, 2005 
    
    
  reject that end user clientÙs access request instead of charging the 
  user for bad services. 
   
  QoS control, e.g. priority control or admission control, is important 
  for multicast CDN. Function to protect network resources from misuse 
  of it is needed.  When NSP controls QoS, userÙs access request has to 
  be authorized after NSP has confirmed that the NSP can accept the 
  request without degrading the QoS beyond the specified level. 
   
   
4.1.2.3 Authentication Requirements 
    
   There are two different aims of authentication.  One is an 
   authentication to network access, and another one is to each content. 
   For the first case of authentication, NSP has a AAA server, and for 
   the second case, each CO has a AAA server. In some cases, COs 
   delegate (outsource) the operation of user authentication to NSPs. 
    
   When NSP supports plural network services, we can not use an 
   authentication mechanism of physical layer such as an 802.1X because 
   NSP needs to independently operate (authenticate) each service. NSP 
   authenticate a user request to multicast network resources, and COs 
   independently authenticate a user request to their content (multicast 
   group). Each entity (NSP and CO) has its own AAA server. Then a 
   synchronization mechanism between authorization and group management 
   is necessary. 
    
   Each entity (NSP and COs) may have its own authentication server. NSP 
   authenticate a client access to use a network resource, and a CO 
   authenticate a client request to access to a multicast group. 
    
    
4.1.3 Summary: Challenges for Multicast CDS 
 
   The key is how a control process of group membership synchronizes 
   with an AAA process (authentication, authorization and accounting). 
   This depends on the network model which should be scalable and 
   adaptable to any case of multicast CDN service.  
    
   An important issue that discourages the wide deployment of IP 
   multicast services is lack of multicast network management functions, 
   especially an effective multicast accounting function. In IP 
   multicast-based Internet TV, we should support a network model where 
   many content owners provide their content to several NSPs which are 
   different entities, and where each provider individually holds their 
   customer information. In this model, keeping the consistency of 
   accounting information in COs and NSPs becomes important. Effective 
   user-based accounting information is critical in two aspects. On one 
   hand, NSPs of commercial multicast services need to accurately 
   identify the users and collect their usage information to generate 
    
    
    
   Hayashi, He, Satou, Ohta                                   [Page 8] 

   Internet Draft        draft-hayashi-maccnt-00         February, 2005 
    
    
   correct billing information.  On the other hand, some content 
   providers need to learn the content usage information. For example, 
   in IP multicast based Internet TV services, NSPs need to know which 
   TV program is being watched and how long a user watches so that they 
   can charge the user based on the value of the TV program. In addition, 
   content providers and TV program owners need to know the rating 
   information (the number of viewers of a TV program) and how long they 
   watch the TV program in order to generate appropriate advertisement 
   revenue. 
    
    
5. IANA considerations 
    
   This I-D does not raise any IANA consideration issues. 
    
    
6. Security considerations 
    
   Accounting capabilities can be used to enhance the security of 
   multicast networks by excluding ineligible clients from the networks. 
    
    
7. Conclusion 
    
   This I-D described problems on accounting issues in multicasting.  
   The general requirements for accounting capabilities were listed.  
   Finally, a case for CDN services was described as an application 
   example which could get benefit from multicasting with accounting 
   capabilities.  It is proposed that this I-D be used as a starting 
   point of the discussion on these issues.
