Abstract

   This document describes the "date" and "index" extensions to the
   Sieve email filtering language.  The "date" extension gives Sieve the
   ability to test date and time values in various ways.  The "index"
   extension provides a means to limit header and address tests to
   specific instances of header fields when header fields are repeated.

   advantage that the number are smaller and day numbers change at
   midnight rather than at noon.

   Added the ability to return the day of the week.

   Use the term "argument" instead of "parameter" throughout.

   Added a "std11" part type as a means to operate on values formatted
   in the same way as a Date: header field.

   Changed the terminology from "part" to "date-part".

   Updated reference to 3028bis, corrected miscellaneous typos.

   Updated the IANA registration templates.

   Added "time" and "date" as possible date-part values with appropriate

   Restricted allowed ISO 8601 formats so that comparisons will be
   reliable.

   Changed the date-part "timezone" to "zone" to make it consistent with
   the :zone parameter.

Internet-Draft       Sieve Date and Index Extensions          March 2007


1.  Introduction

   Sieve [I-D.ietf-sieve-3028bis] is a language for filtering email
   messages at or around the time of final delivery.  It is designed to
   be implementable on either a mail client or mail server.  It is meant
   to be extensible, simple, and independent of access protocol, mail
   architecture, and operating system.  It is suitable for running on a
   mail server where users may not be allowed to execute arbitrary
   programs, such as on black box Internet Message Access Protocol
   [RFC3501] servers, as it has no user-controlled loops or the ability
   to run external programs.

   The "date" extension provides a new date test to extract and match
   date/time information from structured header fields.  The date test
   is similar in concept to the address test specified in
   [I-D.ietf-sieve-3028bis], which performs similar operations on
   addresses in header fields.

   The "date" extension also provides a currentdate test that operates
   on the date and time when the Sieve script is executed.

   Some header fields containing date/time information, e.g.  Received:,
   naturally occur more than one in a single header.  In such cases it
   is useful to be able to restrict the date test to some subset of the
   fields that are present.  For example, it may be useful to apply a
   date test to the last (earliest) Received: field.  Additionally, it
   may also be useful to apply similar restrictions to either the header
   or address tests specified in [I-D.ietf-sieve-3028bis].

   For this reason this specification also defines an "index" extension.
   This extension adds two additional tagged arguments :index and :last
   to the header, address, and date tests.  If present these arguments
   specify which occurrence of the named header field is to be tested.


2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The terms used to describe the various components of the Sieve
   language are taken from [I-D.ietf-sieve-3028bis] section 1.1.  A
   syntactic element defined using ABNF notation [RFC4234] in [RFC3339]
   is also used here.

3.  Capability Identifiers

   The capability strings associated with the two extensions defined in
   this document are "date" and "index".


4.  Date Test

   Usage:   date [":zone" <time-zone: string>] [COMPARATOR]
                 [MATCH-TYPE] <header-name: string> <date-part: string>
                 <key-list: string-list>

   The date test matches date/time information derived from structured
   headers that contain [RFC2822] date-time values.  The date/time
   information is extracted from the header, shifted to the specified
   time zone, and the value of the given date-part is determined.  The
   test returns true if the resulting string matches any of the strings
   specified in the key-list, as modified by the comparator and match
   keywords.  The date test returns false unconditionally if the
   specified header field does not exist, the field exists but does not
   contain a syntactically valid date-time specification, or the
   resulting string fails to match any key-list value.

   The type of match defaults to ":is" and the default comparator is
   "i;ascii-casemap".

   Unlike the header and address tests, the date test can only be
   applied to a single header field at a time.  If multiple header
   fields with the same name are present only the first field that is
   found is used.  (Note, however, that this behavior can be modified
   with the "index" extension defined below.)

   The "relational" extension [I-D.ietf-sieve-3431bis] adds a match type
   called ":count".  The count of a date test is 1 if the specified
   field exists and contains a valid date, zero otherwise.

   Implementations MUST support extraction of date-time information that
   either makes up the entire header field (e.g., as it does in a
   standard Date: header field) and date-time information that appears
   at the end of a header field (e.g., as it does in a standard
   Received: header field).  Implementations MAY support extraction of
   date-time information that appears in other positions in the header
   field content.

4.1.  Zone Argument

   The value of time-zone MUST be an offset relative to UTC with the
   following syntax:



Freed                   Expires September 4, 2007               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft       Sieve Date and Index Extensions          March 2007


       time-zone  =  ( "+" / "-" ) 4DIGIT

   If the :zone is left out the local time zone MUST be used.

4.2.  Date-part Argument

   The date-part argument specifies a particular part of the resulting
   date/time value to match against the key-list.  Possible values are:

     "year"      => the current year, "0000" .. "9999".
     "month"     => the current month, "01" .. "12".
     "day"       => the current day, "01" .. "31".
     "date"      => the current date in "yyyy-mm-dd" format.
     "julian"    => the Modified Julian Day, that is, the date
                    expressed as an integer number of days since
                    12:00AM on November 17, 1858 (using the Julian
                    calendar). This corresponds to the regular
                    Julian Day minus 2400000.5.
     "hour"      => the current hour, "00" .. "23".
     "minute"    => the current hour, "00" .. "59".
     "second"    => the current second, "00" .. "59".
     "time"      => the current time in "hh:mm:ss" format.
     "iso8601"   => the current date and time in restricted
                    ISO 8601 format.
     "std11"     => the current date and time in a format appropriate
                    for use in a Date: header field [RFC2822].
     "zone"      => the time zone in use.  If the user specified a
                    time zone with ":zone", "zone" will
                    contain that value.  Otherwise, the value
                    will be the server's default time zone in offset
                    format "+hhmm" or "-hhmm". An offset of 0 (Zulu)
                    always has a positive sign.
     "weekday"   => the current day of the week expressed as an
                    integer between "0" and "6". "0" is Sunday,
                    "1" is Monday, etc.

   The restricted ISO 8601 format is specified by the date-time ABNF
   production given in [RFC3339] section 5.6, with the added
   restrictions that the letters "T" and "Z" MUST be in upper case and a
   time zone offset of zero MUST be represented by "Z" and not "+00:00".


5.  Currentdate Test

   Usage:   currentdate [":zone" <time-zone: string>]
                        [COMPARATOR] [MATCH-TYPE]
                        <date-part: string>
                        <key-list: string-list>



Freed                   Expires September 4, 2007               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft       Sieve Date and Index Extensions          March 2007


   The currentdate test is similar to the date test, except that it
   operates on the current date/time rather than a value extracted from
   the message header.  In particular, the ":zone" and date-part
   arguments are the same as those in the date test.

   All currentdate tests in a single Sieve script MUST refer to the same
   point in time.

   The :count value of a currentdate test is always 1.


6.  Index Extension

   The "index" extension, if specified, adds optional :index and :last
   arguments to the header, address, and date tests as follows:

   Syntax:   date [":index" <fieldno: number> [":last"]]
                  [":zone" <time-zone: string>] [COMPARATOR]
                  [MATCH-TYPE] <header-name: string>
                  <date-part: string> <key-list: string-list>


   Syntax:   header [":index" <fieldno: number> [":last"]]
                    [COMPARATOR] [MATCH-TYPE]
                    <header-names: string-list> <key-list: string-list>


   Syntax:   address [":index" <fieldno: number> [":last"]]
                     [ADDRESS-PART] [COMPARATOR] [MATCH-TYPE]
                     <header-list: string-list> <key-list: string-list>

   If :index <fieldno> is specified, the attempts to match a value are
   limited to the header field fieldno (beginning at 1, the first named
   header field).  If :last is also specified, the count is backwards; 1
   denotes the last named header field, 2 the second to last, and so on.
   Specifying :last without :index has no effect.

   Both header and address allow the specification of more than one
   header field name.  If more than one header field name is specified
   all the named header fields are counted in the order specified by the
   header-list.


7.  Security Considerations

   The facilities defined here, like the facilities in the base Sieve
   specification, operate on message header information which can easily
   be forged.

Internet-Draft       Sieve Date and Index Extensions          March 2007


   All of the security considerations given in the base Sieve
   specification also apply to these extensions.


8.  IANA Considerations

   The following templates specify the IANA registrations of the two
   Sieve extensions specified in this document:
