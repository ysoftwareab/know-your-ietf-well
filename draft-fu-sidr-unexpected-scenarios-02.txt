          Scenarios of unexpected resource assignment in RPKI
                 draft-fu-sidr-unexpected-scenarios-02

Abstract

   There are some unexpected scenarios where a CA allocates resources to
   the sub-node caused by misoperation or malicious operation of CA in
   RPKI.  Then some mechanisms may be needed to avoid these scenarios to
   happen.  This document describes these scenarios and related
   experiments are presented.

1.  Introduction

   n RPKI, CAs (Certification Authorities) are organized in a
   hierarchical structure which is aligned to the existing INR (Internet
   Number Resources, including IP prefixes and AS numbers) allocation
   hierarchy.  Each INR allocation requires corresponding resource
   certificates to attest to it.  Two important resource certificates
   [RFC6480] are needed during this allocation process, and they are CA
   certificates and EE (End-entity) certificates: CA certificates attest
   to the INR holdings; EE certificates are primarily used for the
   validation of ROAs (Route Origin Authorizations) [RFC6482] which is
   used to verify whether an AS is permitted to originate routes to
   specific IP prefixes.  Besides, Manifest [RFC6486] is used to ensure
   the integrity of the repository.  So the operation of CA is very
   important for the RPKI deployment and applications based on it.

   Considering misoperation and malicious operation are inevitable and
   the significant impact they may cause, this draft describes and
   analyzes some scenarios of the unexpected resource assignment caused
   by CA in RPKI deployment.  Then some experiments are given to show
   these scenarios more clearly.  Some suggestions are also proposed to
   avoid corresponding side-effects.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  The scenarios of unexpected resource assignment

   As described in [RFC6480], the holder of resource ( IP addresses and
   AS numbers ) may reallocate portions of that block, to the sub-node,
   subject to contractual constraints established by the registries.
   But some scenarios of unexpected resource allocation may be caused by
   the misoperaion of malicious operation of the CA as below: for
   simplicity, we describe some scenarios with the AS number allocation
   case.

3.1.  Unauthorized resource assignment

   For this scenario, a CA allocates a block of IP address which does
   not belong to him to subordinate node.  That is, this CA doesn't own
   this block of IP Prefixes actually.  So the sub-node cannot use these
   addresses.  But in RPKI scenario, this assignment could be operated
   successfully.  This scenario may be caused by misoperation of the CA
   or on purpose.

   According to the resources to be allocated, we divide this case into
   two kinds of scenarios: Completely unauthorized assignment and
   Partially unauthorized assignment.

   (1) Completely unauthorized assignment: the resources to be allocated
   to subordinate node are without the ownership of CA.

   (2) Partially unauthorized assignment: the resources to be allocated
   to subordinate node are with the partially ownership of CA.

3.2.  Resource reassignment

   In this scenario, a CA reassign the resource to one sub-node which
   has been already assigned to another sub-node.  This scenario could
   be sorted into three types:

Internet-Draft    draft-fu-sidr-unexpected-scenarios-02   September 2016


   (1) Matching: the block of IP address which is reassigned is the same
   as which has been already assigned to the other sub-node.

   (2) Subset: The block of IP address which is reassigned is smaller
   than which has been already assigned to the other sub-node.

   (3) Intersection: The block of IP address which is reassigned has
   overlap with which has been already assigned to the other sub-node.

3.3.  Resource transfer

   In practice, resource transfer between two Internet registries is
   reasonably achievable for most useful operational needs.  For the
   resource transfer, a block of IP addresses will be transferred from
   one sub-node to the other.  This scenario is described in
   [I-D.ymbk-sidr-transfer] in more detail.  The resource reassignment
   may happened in this scenario by the misoperation of the CA.

4.  Experimental Result

   We test the scenarios described above in our testbed.  In this
   section, we present the test results for each case and analyze these
   results.

4.1.  Unauthorized resource assignment

4.1.1.  Completely unauthorized assignment

   The test scenario is described in Figure 1: APNIC allocates AS number
   65551 and IP prefixes of 192.0.3.128/26 to TWNIC.  But APNIC doesn't
   own this resource completely.  We simulated this process of
   assignment on our testbed and the result is illustrated in Figure 2.

      Figure 4: The test result of partially unauthorized assignment

4.2.  Resource reassignment

   In the "Resource reassignment" case, we mean that a CA allocate the
   resources, which have been allocated to one subordinate CA ( e.g.
   CNNIC ), to another subordinate CA ( e.g.  JPNIC ).  This case may
   also be caused by misoperation of CA or on purpose.  And it may
   result in resource conflicts in the Internet.

4.2.1.  Matching case

   For the matching case, the test scenario is described in Figure 5:
   the resources to be allocated to JPNIC (ASNs 132178-132189) is
   identical to those allocated to CNNIC (ASNs 132178-132189).

                Figure 6: The test result of matching case

   CNNIC and JPNIC receive the same resource assigned by the APNIC at
   the same time.  So the same resource could be allocated to the
   different sub-node simultaneously.

4.2.2.  Intersection case

   As is shown in Figure 7, in the intersection case, there is an
   overlap between the resources to be allocated to JPNIC (ASNs
   132180-132190) and those allocated to CNNIC (ASNs 132177-132185).

4.2.3.  Subset case

   For the subset case, the network architecture is described in
   Figure 9: APNIC allocates the ASN 65540 and a block of IP address (
   203.0.113.128/26 ) to JPNIC.  Then it reallocated this resources to
   CNNIC.  These resources are the subset of CNNIC's resource.

                 Figure 10: The test result of subset case

   CNNIC and JPNIC could receive the same resources assigned by APNIC at
   the same time.  So the test result verify that the same resources
   could be allocated to different sub-nodes simultaneously.

4.3.  Resource transfer

   This issue is described in [I-D.ymbk-sidr-transfer].  The most
   serious problem caused by it is the address reassignment described
   above.

5.  Solutions

   In order to avoid the above issues or reduce the related side-
   effects, the following two solutions may be needed.

5.1.  The CA function enhancement

   We have designed a mechanism to enhance the CA function to avoid the
   above misoperation or malicious operation.  The detail information
   will be given in the future.

5.2.  The RP function enhancement

   The enhancement of RP function is needed to discover these resource
   assignment errors.

6.  Security Considerations

   TBD.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This draft does not request any IANA action.
