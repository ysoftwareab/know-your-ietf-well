1.  Introduction

   [RFC7970] defines a data representation for security incident reports
   and indicators commonly exchanged by operational security teams.  It
   facilitates the automated exchange of this information to enable
   mitigation and watch-and-warning.  Section 3 of [RFC7970] defined an
   information model using Unified Modeling Language (UML) and a
   corresponding Extensible Markup Language (XML) schema data model in
   Section 8.  This UML-based information model and XML-based data model
   are referred to as IODEF UML and IODEF XML, respectively in this
   document.

   This document defines an alternate implementation of the IODEF UML
   information model by specifying a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
   data model using JSON Schema [jsonschema].  This JSON data model is
   referred to as IODEF JSON in this document.

   IODEF JSON provides all of the expressivity of IODEF XML.  It gives
   implementers and operators an alternative format to exchange the same
   information.

Internet-Draft                 JSON-IODEF                      July 2018


   The normative IODEF JSON data model is found in Section 5.  Section 2
   and Section 3 describe the data types and elements of this data
   model.  Section 4 provides examples.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  IODEF Data Types

   The abstract IODEF JSON implements the abstract data types specified
   in Section 2 of [RFC7970].

2.1.  Abstract Data Type to JSON Data Type Mapping

   IODEF JSON uses native and derived JSON data types.  Figure 1
   describes the mapping between the abstract data types in Section 2 of
   [RFC7970] and their corresponding implementations in IODEF JSON.

2.2.  Complex JSON Types

2.2.1.  Multilingual Strings

   A string that needs to be represented in a human-readable language
   different than the default encoding of the document is represented in
   the information model by the ML_STRING data type.  This data type is
   implemented as an object with "value", "lang", and "translation-id"
   elements as defined in Section 5.  Examples are shown below.

   "MLStringType": {
     "value": "free-form text",                              //STRING
     "lang": "en",                                             //ENUM
     "translation-id": "jp2en0023"                           //STRING
   }

2.2.2.  Software and SoftwareReference

   A particular version of software is represented in the information
   model by the SOFTWARE data type.  This software can be described by
   using a reference, a URL, or with free-form text.  The SOFTWARE data
   type is implemented as an object with "SoftwareReference", "URL",
   "Description", and "Description_ML" elements as defined in Section 5.
   Examples are shown below.

   "SoftwareType": {
     "SoftwareReference": {...},          //SoftwareReference
     "Description": ["MS Windows"]        //STRING
   }

   SoftwareReference class is a reference to a particular version of
   software.  Examples are shown below.

   "SoftwareReference": {
     "value": "cpe:/a:google:chrome:59.0.3071.115 ",   //STRING
     "spec-name": "cpe",                                 //ENUM
     "dtype": "string",                                  //ENUM
   }

2.2.3.  StructuredInfo

   Information provided in a form of structured string, such as ID, or
   structured information, such as XML documents, is represented in the
   information model by the StructuredInfo data type.  Note that this
   type was originally specified in RFC7203.  The StructuredInfo data
   type is implemented as an object with "SpecID", "ext-SpecID",
   "ContentID", "RawData", "Reference" elements.  An example for
   embedding a structured ID is shown below.

   "StructuredInformation": {
     "SpecID": "cve",                                          //ENUM
     "ContentID": "CVE-2007-5000"                            //STRING
   }

   When embedding the raw data, base64 conversion should be used for
   encoding the data, as shown below.

   "StructuredInformation": {
     "SpecID": "oval",                                         //ENUM
     "RawData": "<<<strings encoded with base64>>>"            //BYTE
   }

2.2.4.  EXTENSION

   Information not otherwise represented in the IODEF can be added using
   the EXTENSION data type.  This data type is a generic extension
   mechanism.  The EXTENSION data type is implemented as an
   ExtensionType object with "value", "name", "dtype", "ext-dtype",
   "meaning", "formatid", "restriction", "ext-restriction", and
   "observable-id" elements.  An example for embedding a structured ID
   is shown below.

   "ExtensionType": {
     "value": "xxxxxxx",                                      //String
     "name": "Syslog",                                        //String
     "dtype": "string",                                       //String
     "meaning": "Syslog from the security appliance X",       //String
   }

3.2.  Mapping between JSON and XML IODEF

   o  This document treats attributes and elements of each class defined
      in [RFC7970] equally and is agnostic on the order of their
      appearances.

   o  Flow class is deleted, and classes with its instances now directly
      have instances of EventData class that used to belong to the Flow
      classs.

      directly have instance of Signature class that used to belong to
      the SignatureData class.

   o  IndicatorData class is deleted, and classes with its instances now
      directly have the instances of Indicator class that used to belong
      to the IndicatorData class.

   o  ObservableReference class is deleted, and classes with its
      instances now directly have uid-ref as an element.

   o  Record class is replaced by RecordData class, and RecordData class
      is renamed to Record class.

   o  Record class is deleted, and classes with its instances now
      directly have the instances of RecordData class that used to
      belong to the Record class.

   o  The elements of ML_STRING type are prepared as two separate
      elements: one of STRING type and another of ML_STRING type, in
      order to maintain the simplicity of IODEF documents when writing
      with only STRING type characters.

4.  Examples

   This section provides example of IODEF documents.  These examples do
   not represent the full capabilities of the data model or the the only
   way to encode particular information.

4.1.  Minimal Example

   A document containing only the mandatory elements and attributes.
