Internet-Draft          NETCONF Monitoring Schema              June 2009


Abstract

   This document defines a NETCONF data model (in XML Schema) to be used
   to monitor the NETCONF protocol.  The monitoring data model includes
   information about NETCONF datastores, sessions, locks and statistics.
   This data facilitates the management of a NETCONF server.  This
   document also defines methods for NETCONF clients to discover data
   models supported by a NETCONF server and defines a new NETCONF <get-
   schema> operation to retrieve them.

Internet-Draft          NETCONF Monitoring Schema              June 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document defines NETCONF content via [XMLSchema] to be used to
   monitor the NETCONF protocol.  It provides information about NETCONF
   sessions.  Today, NETCONF capabilities exchange is the only
   standardized method a client can use to discover the functionality
   supported by a NETCONF server.  This works well for static protocol
   capabilities but is not well suited for capabilities which could
   change during a session.

   Considerations such as different schema formats, feature optionality
   and access controls can all impact the applicability and level of
   detail the NETCONF server sends to a client during session setup.
   Through updated monitoring data NETCONF clients can adjust their
   capabilities throughout a session.  Specifically the details returned
   can be used by a client to determine whether retrieval of new schema
   information is required and includes the information required to
   facilitate the retrieval.  The methods defined in this document
   address the need for further means to query and retrieve schema and
   netconf state information from a NETCONF server.  These are provided
   to complement existing base NETCONF capabilities and operations and
   in no way affect existing behaviour.

   A new <get-schema> operation is also defined to support explicit
   schema retrieval via NETCONF.

1.1.  Definition of Terms

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as d/lockedescribed in [RFC2119].

   Schema:  A machine readable data model definition.  The schema is
      independent of which data modeling language is used for the data
      model.

   XML Schema:  The W3C XML Schema [XMLSchema] data modeling language.

   YANG:  YANG is a data modeling language used to model configuration
      and state data manipulated by the NETCONF protocol, NETCONF remote
      procedure calls, and NETCONF notifications.

2.  XML Schema to Monitor NETCONF

   The following data allows a NETCONF client to monitor both the
   NETCONF server itself and the associated network device operational
   data.  A server that implements the data model defined in this
   document MUST advertise the capability URI
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:state".  The specific monitoring data
   defined in this draft which MUST be present follows.

2.1.  The /netconf-state Subtree


  The /netconf-state subtree is the root of the monitoring
  data model.  It acts as the container for the other monitored data.

    netconf-state
     |_capabilities
     |_datastores
     |_schemas
     |_sessions
     |_statistics

  capabilities
    List of NETCONF capabilities supported by the server.

  datastores
    List of NETCONF datastores on the server.
    Includes all supported datastore types (running, candidate, startup)

  schemas
    List of schemas supported on the server.
    Includes all the information required to identify the schemas and
    to support their retrieval.

  sessions
    List of all active NETCONF sessions on the device.
    Includes sessions for all NETCONF clients across all protocols.

  statistics
    Contains management stats for the NETCONF server
     including performance and error related counters.

2.1.1.  The /netconf-state/capabilities Subtree

   The /netconf-state/capabilibiles subtree contains the capabilities
   supported by the NETCONF server.  The list MUST include all
   capabilities exchanged during session setup still applicable at the
   time of the request.  This ensures consistency with the initial

Internet-Draft          NETCONF Monitoring Schema              June 2009


   capabilities exchanged while allowing for potential modifications
   during a session.

2.1.2.  The /netconf-state/datastores Subtree

The /netconf-state/datastores subtree contains configuration data
for the NETCONF server including information on the lock state of
the datastores.

configuration (type:  ConfigurationDataStore)
     |_name
     |_locks

name (type: NETCONFDatastoreType)
   Enumeration of supported datastores; candidate, running, startup.

locks (type: xs:choice)
   The NETCONF <lock> and <partial-lock> operations allow a client
   to lock specific resources in a datastore.  The NETCONF server will
   prevent changes to the locked resources by all sessions except
   the one which acquired the lock(s).

   To provide clients the ability to manage locked resources lock
   information is provided for each ConfigurationDataStore instance.
   The lock data includes details such as the session which acquired
   the lock, the type of lock (global or partial) and the list of locked
   resources.  Multiple locks per datastore are supported.

   Both a global lock and a partial lock MUST contain the sessionId.

   For partial locks the list of locked nodes is also returned. Since
   this list may change over time the select expressions originally used
   to request the lock are also returned.  The select expression
   indicates the original intended scope of the lock and time the lock
   was acquired.  The scope of the partial lock is defined by the list
   of locked nodes.

2.1.3.  The /netconf-state/schemas Subtree

Internet-Draft          NETCONF Monitoring Schema              June 2009


  The list of supported schema for the NETCONF server.

   schema
      |_identifier   (key)
      |_version      (key)
      |_format       (key)
      |_namespace
      |_location

  The elements identifier, version, and format are used as a key in the
  schema list.  These are used in the <get-schema> operation.

  identifier (type: xs:string)
    Identifier for the schema list entry.  For modeling languages which
    support or require a data model name (eg: YANG module name) the
    identifier MUST match that name.  For modeling lanuguages which
    do not this must contain some other identifier such as filename.

    Identifier is used in the <get-schema> operation and may
    be used for other means such as file retrieval.

  version (type:  xs:string)
    Version of the schema supported.  Multiple versions MAY be supported
    simultaneously by a NETCONF server.  Each version MUST be reported
    individually in the schema list, i.e. with same identifier, possibly
    different location, but different version.

  format (type: xs:QName)
    The data modeling language of the file/module.  Current selection of
    XSD, YANG, and RNG.

  namespace(type: xs:anyURI)
    The XML namespace defined by the data model.

  location (type:  xs:union: xs:string, xs:anyURI)
    One of more locations from which this specific schema, format, and
    version can be retrieved.  The list SHOULD contain at least one
    entry per schema.

    A schema entry may be located on a network device (eg: xs:anyURI),
    (eg: xs:string reference to file system for ftp retrieval) or
    available explicitly via NETCONF (xs:string value 'NETCONF') for
    NETCONF servers which support the schema-retrieval capability via
    <get-schema>.

2.1.4.  The /netconf-state/sessions Subtree

   Includes session specific data for NETCONF management sessions.

   sessions (type: ManagementSession):

   session
          |_sessionId (key)
          |_transport
          |_username
          |_sourceHost
          |_loginTime
          |_inRpcs
          |_inBadRpcs
          |_outRpcErrors
          |_outNotifications

   sessionId (type: SessionId)
     Unique NETCONF identifier for the session, used for all
     supported operations (e.g. monitoring, session kill, lock
     release) regardless of protocol.
     MUST be a unique non-0 value for all sessions reported.
     SessionId=0 will not be reported in the session table.
     For purposes of NETCONF management all sessions are one of:
        Known session:  any session which can be managed by the
           NETCONF server SHOULD be reported in this table and
           MUST map to a unique sessionId as described above
        Unknown session:  such sessions are not managed by the
           NETCONF server and all map to sessionId=0.  These MUST
           be excluded from the session table as a result.
      SessionId=0 will continue to be reported in error messages
      with sessionId=0 per existing 4741 definition.

   transport (type: xs: QName)
     Idenfities NETCONF transport for each session, e.g. "netconf-ssh".

   username (type: xs:string)
     Subject to the authentication mechanisms and security
     considerations this SHOULD contain an identifier which
     can be used to uniquely identify an individual client
     (human or machine).  This is likely be implementation
     specific subject to the security requirements of the
     device vendor and/or operators.  e.g. an SSH user, a host RSA
     fingerprint or other identifier deemed acceptable

   sourceHost (type: inet:host)
     Host identifier (IP + name) for the client.
     See section 5.2 for definition.

   loginTime (type: xs:dateTime)
     Time at which the session was established.

   inRpcs (type: ZeroBasedCounter32)
     Number of correct <rpc> requests received.

   inBadRpcs (type: ZeroBasedCounter32)
     Number of messages received when a <rpc> message was expected,
     that were not correct <rpc> messages.  This includes XML parse
     errors and errors on the rpc layer.

   outRpcErrors (type: ZeroBasedCounter32)
     Number of <rpc-reply> messages sent which contained an <rpc-error>
     element.

   outNotifications (type: ZeroBasedCounter32)
     Number of <notification> messages sent.

2.1.5.  The /netconf-state/statistics Subtree

 Statistical data pertaining to the NETCONF server.

 statistics
    |_netconfStartTime
    |_inBadHellos
    |_inSessions
    |_droppedSessions
    |_inRpcs
    |_inBadRpcs
    |_outRpcErrors
    |_outNotifications

 statistics (type: ManagementStatistics):
   Contains management session related performance data for the NETCONF
   server.

   Data type ZeroBasedCounter32 is defined and used for counters.
   Counters are zero based with following reset behaviour:
      - at start of a session for all per session counters
        (in /netconf-state/sessions)
      - re-initilization of NETCONF server for global counters
        (in /netconf-state/statistics)
      - when max value is reached for all per session and global
        counters

 netconfStartTime (type: xs:dateTime)
   Date and time at which the NETCONF server process was started.
   Allows for calculation of simple time interval for reported metrics.

Internet-Draft          NETCONF Monitoring Schema              June 2009


   Ie:  current time - startTime defines the collection interval for the
   metrics allowing for calculations such as averages.
   More complex calculations would require multiple collection
   intervals with both start and stop times defined per interval.

 inBadHellos (type: ZeroBasedCounter32)
   Number of sessions silently dropped because an
   invalid <hello> message was received.  This includes hello
   messages with a 'session-id' attribute, bad namespace, and
   bad capability declarations.

 inSessions (type: ZeroBasedCounter32)
   Number of sessions started.  This counter is incremented when
   a <hello> message with a <session-id> is sent.
   I.e. inSessions - inBadHellos = number of correctly started
    netconf sessions

 droppedSessions (type: ZeroBasedCounter32)
   Number of sessions that were abnormally terminated, e.g. due
   to idle timeout or transport close.  This counter is not
   incremented when a session is properly closed by a
   <close-session> operation, or killed by a <kill-session>
   operation.

 inRpcs (type: ZeroBasedCounter32)
   Number of correct <rpc> requests received.

 inBadRpcs (type: ZeroBasedCounter32)
   Number of messages received when a <rpc> message was expected,
   that were not correct <rpc> messages.  This includes XML parse
   errors and errors on the rpc layer.

 outRpcErrors (type: ZeroBasedCounter32)
   Number of <rpc-reply> messages sent which contained an <rpc-error>
   element.

 outNotifications (type: ZeroBasedCounter32)
   Number of <notification> messages sent.

3.  Schema Specific Operations

3.1.  The <get-schema> Operation

   Description: When the schema is available on the device and the
   client wishes to have it returned via NETCONF this new operation is
   used.

   Parameters:

   identifier (type: xs:string): Identifier for the schema list entry.

   version (type: xs:string): Version of the schema supported.

   format (type: SchemaFormat): The data modeling language of the
   schema.

   Example: Retrieve a specific schema from the device using <get-
   schema> operation

   <rpc message-id="101"
        xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
     <get-schema xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:state">
       <identifier>foo</identifier>
       <version>v1</version>
       <format>XSD</format>
     </get-schema>
   </rpc>
   >
   Positive Response: The NETCONF server returns the XML schema (XSD).

   <rpc-reply message-id="101"
              xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
     <data><
       <xs:schema>
         <!-- Contents of foo schema would be returned here -->
       </xs:schema>>
     </data>
   </rpc-reply>

3.2.  NETCONF Schema List Retrieval (<get> monitoring data)

   A NETCONF client retrieves the list of supported schema from a
   NETCONF server by retrieving the /netconf-state/schema subtree via a
   >get< operation.  Available schema for the requesting session are
   returned in the reply containing the <identifier> ,<version>,
   <format> and <location> elements.  Since the same schema may be
   supported in multiple locations and/or have multiple versions and/or

Internet-Draft          NETCONF Monitoring Schema              June 2009


   multiple formats no particular attribute is unique.  An empty reply
   is returned if there are no available schema.

   The response data can be used to determine the available schema and
   their versions.  The schema itself (i.e. schema content) is not
   returned in the response.  The URL details returned in the list
   SHOULD facilitate retrieval from a network location via a means such
   as ftp or http.

   Negative Response: If the requested schema is not available the
   <operation-failed> response will be generated as follows: If no
   schema matches the requested parameters the <error-tag> will be
   'operation-failed', and the <error-app-tag> will be 'no-matches'.  If
   access control denies the partial lock, the <error-tag> will be
   'access-denied'.  Additionally the ability to retrieve a schema via
   NETCONF SHOULD be supported.  When a schema is available on the
   device and the schema-retrieval capability is supported by the
   NETCONF server a location value of 'NETCONF' MUST be used to indicate
   that it can be retrieved via NETCONF using the <get-schema> operation
   described in section 3.1.

4.1.  Retrieving schema list via <get>

    <rpc message-id="101"
         xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">

        </filter>
      </get>
    </rpc>

   The NETCONF server returns a list of data models available for
   retrieval.

4.2.  Retrieving schema instances

   Given the reply in the previous section, the following examples
   illustrate the availability of 'foo', 'bar', and 'bar-types' schema
   at multiple locations, with multiple formats, and in multiple
   locations.

     1.  foo,  version 1.0 in XSD format:

       a.  Via FTP using location
           ftp://ftp.example.com/schemas/foo_1.0.xsd

       b.  Via HTTP using location
           http://www.example.com/schema/foo/1.0.xsd

       c.  Via <get-schema> using identifier, version, and
           format parameters.

       <rpc message-id="102"
            xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
         <get-schema xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:state">
           <identifer>foo</identifer>
           <version>1.0</version>
           <format>XSD</format>
         </get-schema>
       </rpc>


     2. bar, version 2008-06-01 in YANG format:

       a.  Via HTTP using location
           http://example.com/schema/bar-2008-06-01.yang

       b.  Via <get-schema> using identifer, version, and
           format parameters:

       <rpc message-id="103"
            xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
         <get-schema xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:state">

6.  Security Considerations

   The NETCONF monitoring schema as defined in this document provides
   information about a NETCONF system that could be used to aid an
   attack on that system.  The same considerations as for the base
   NETCONF Protocol [RFC4741] are valid.  It is assumed that access to
   the data and operations defined in this document are subject to
   appropriate access control on the device.

Appendix A.  YANG module (non-normative)

   The following YANG module is included as a reference only.  It is
   based on YANG specification at the time of publishing and is subject
   to change as a result of NETMOD work underway to refine YANG.


It is worth noting the included YANG module has a distinct advantage
over the normative XSD:

The normative XSD in this draft does not allow for vendor
extensions of the data model without modification of the base
schema.

In the YANG model, identities are used to provide extensibile
enumerations.  In the XSD, this is partially addressed by the use
of QName datatype in the model.

Although this approach is more restrictive than other alternatives
(such as redefinition) it was chosen for simplicity and improved
interoperability.
