AFI = x:  x can be any AFI value from [AFI].  When a specific address
      family has a multicast address semantic, this field must be either
      a group address or a broadcast address.

AFI = x:  x can be any AFI value from [AFI].  When a specific AFI has
      its own encoding of a multicast address, this field must be either

AFI = x:  x can be any AFI value from [AFI].  This is the locator

      For efficiency reasons, all RTR/ETR entries for the same level
      should be combined together by a Map-Server to avoid searching
      through the entire multi-level list of locator entries in a Map-
