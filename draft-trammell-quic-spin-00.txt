       The Addition of a Spin Bit to the QUIC Transport Protocol
                      draft-trammell-quic-spin-00

Abstract

   This document summarizes work to date on the addition of a "spin
   bit", intended for explicit measurability of end-to-end RTT on QUIC
   flows.  It proposes a detailed mechanism for the spin bit, describes
   how to use it to measure end-to-end latency, discusses corner cases
   and workarounds therefor in the measurement, describes experimental
   evaluation of the mechanism done to date, and examines the utility
   and privacy implications of the spin bit.  As the overhead and risk
   associated with the spin bit are negligible, and the utility of a
   passive RTT measurement signal at higher resolution than once per
   flow is clear, this document advocates for the addition of the spin
   bit to the protocol.

1.  Introduction

   The QUIC transport protocol [QUIC-TRANS] is a UDP-encapsulated
   protocol integrated with Transport Layer Security (TLS) [TLS] to
   encrypt most of its protocol internals, beyond those handshake
   packets needed to establish or resume a TLS session, and information
   required to reassemble QUIC streams (the packet number) and to route
   QUIC packets to the correct machine in a load-balancing situation
   (the connection ID).  In other words, in contrast to TCP, QUIC's wire
   image (see [WIRE-IMAGE]) exposes much less information about



Trammell, et al.          Expires June 3, 2018                  [Page 2]

   transport protocol state than TCP's wire image.  Specifically, the
   fact that sequence and acknowledgement numbers and timestamps cannot
   be seen by on-path observes in QUIC as they can be in the TCP means
   that passive TCP loss and latency measurement techniques that rely on
   this information (e.g.  [CACM-TCP], [TMA-QOF]) cannot be easily
   ported to work with QUIC.

   This document proposes a solution to this problem by adding a
   "latency spin bit" to the QUIC short header.  This bit is designed
   solely for explicit passive measurability of the protocol.  It
   provides one RTT sample per RTT to passive observers of QUIC traffic.
   It describes the mechanism, how it can be added to QUIC, and how it
   can be used by passive measurement facilities to generate RTT
   samples.  It explores potential corner cases and shortcomings of the
   mechanism and how they can be worked around.  It summarizes
   experimental results to date with an implementation of the spin bit
   built atop a recent QUIC implementation.  It additionally describes
   use cases for passive RTT measurement at the resolution provided by
   the spin bit.  It further reviews findings on privacy risk researched
   by the QUIC RTT Design Team, which was tasked by the IETF QUIC
   Working Group to determine the risk/utility tradeoff for the spin
   bit.

   The spin bit has low overhead, presents negligible privacy risk, and
   has clear utility in providing passive RTT measurability of QUIC that
   is far superior to QUIC's measurability without the spin bit, and
   equivalent to or better than TCP passive measurability.

2.  The Spin Bit Mechanism

   The latency spin bit enables latency monitoring from observation
   points on the network path.  The bit is set by the endpoints in the
   following way:

   o  The server sets the spin bit value to the value of the spin bit in
      the packet received from the client with the largest packet
      number.




Trammell, et al.          Expires June 3, 2018                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                  Spin Bit                   November 2017


   o  The client sets the spin bit value to the opposite of the value
      set in the packet received from the server with the largest packet
      number, or to 0 if no packet as been received yet.

   If packets are delivered in order, this procedure will cause the spin
   bit to change value in each direction once per round trip.
   Observation points can estimate the network latency by observing
   these changes in the latency spin bit, as described in Section 3.

2.1.  Proposed Short Header Format Including Spin Bit

   Since it is possible to measure handshake RTT without a spin bit (see
   Section 3.2), it is sufficient to include the spin bit in the short
   packet header.  This proposal suggests to ues the second most
   significant bit (0x40) of the first octet in the short header for the
   spin bit.

   This will shift the Connection ID flag and the Key Phase Bit to 0x20
   and 0x10 respectively, and will limit the number of available short
   packet types to 16.

3.  Using the Spin Bit for Passive RTT Measurement

   When a QUIC flow is sending at full rate (i.e., neither application
   nor flow control limited), the latency spin bit in each direction
   changes value once per round-trip time (RTT).  An on-path observer
   can observe the time difference between edges in the spin bit signal
   to measure one sample of end-to-end RTT.  Note that this measurement,
   as with passive RTT measurement for TCP, includes any transport
   protocol delay (e.g., delayed sending of acknowledgements) and/or
   application layer delay (e.g., waiting for a request to complete).
   It therefore provides devices on path a good instantaneous estimate



Trammell, et al.          Expires June 3, 2018                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                  Spin Bit                   November 2017


   of the RTT as experienced by the application.  A simple linear
   smoothing or moving minimum filter can be applied to the stream of
   RTT information to get a more stable estimate.

   We note that the Latency Spin Bit, and the measurements that can be
   done with it, can be seen as an end-to-end extension of a special
   case of the alternate marking method described in [ALT-MARK].

3.1.  Limitations and Workarounds

   Application-limited and flow-control-limited senders can have
   application and transport layer delay, respectively, that are much
   greater than network RTT.  Therefore, the spin bit provides network
   latency information only when the sender is neither application nor
   flow control limited.  When the sender is application-limited by
   periodic application traffic, where that period is longer than the
   RTT, measuring the spin bit provides information about the
   application period, not the RTT.  Simple heuristics based on the
   observed data rate per flow or changes in the RTT series can be used
   to reject bad RTT samples due to application or flow control
   limitation.

   Since the spin bit logic at each endpoint considers only samples on
   packets that advance the largest packet number seen, signal
   generation itself is resistent to reordering.  However, reordering
   can cause problems at an observer by causing spurious edge detection
   and therefore low RTT estimates.  This can be probabilistically
   mitigated by the observer tracking the low-order bits of the packet
   number, and rejecting edges that appear out-of-order.

3.2.  Alternate RTT Measurement Approaches for Diagnosing QUIC flows

   There are two broad alternatives to explicit signaling for passive
   RTT measurement for measuring the RTT experienced by QUIC flows.

   The first of these is handshake RTT measurement.  As described in
   [QUIC-MGT], the packets of the QUIC handshake are distinguishable on
   the wire in such a way that they can be used for one RTT measurement
   sample per flow: the delay between the client initial and the server
   cleartext packet can be used to measure "upstream" RTT (between the
   observer and the server), and the delay between the server cleartext
   packet and the next client cleartext packet can be used to measure
   "downstream" RTT (between the client and the observer).  When RTT
   measurements are used in large aggregates (all flows traversing a
   large link, for example), a methodology based on handshake RTT could
   be used to generate sufficient samples for some purposes without the
   spin bit.




Trammell, et al.          Expires June 3, 2018                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                  Spin Bit                   November 2017


   However, this methodology would rely on the assumption that the
   difference between handshake RTT and nominal in-flow RTT is
   negligible.  Specifically, (1) any additional delay required to
   compute any cryptographic parameters must be negligible with respect
   to network RTT; (2) any additional delay required to establish state
   along the path must be negligible with respect to network RTT; and
   (3) network treatment of initial packets in a flow must identical to
   that of later packets in the flow.  When these assumptions cannot be
   shown to hold, spin-bit based RTT measurement is preferable to
   handshake RTT measurement, even for applications for which handshake
   RTT measurement would otherwise be suitable.

   The second alternative is parallel active measurement: using ICMP
   Echo Request and Reply [RFC0792] [RFC4433], a dedicated measurement
   protocol like TWAMP [RFC5357], or a separate diagnostic QUIC flow to
   measure RTT.  Regardless of protocol, the active measurement must be
   initiated by a client on the same network as the client of the QUIC
   flow(s) of interest, or a network close by in the Internet topology,
   toward the server.  Note that there is no guarantee that ICMP flows
   will receive the same network treatment as the flows under study,
   both due to differential treatment of ICMP traffic and due to ECMP
   routing (see e.g.  [TOKYO-PING]).  TWAMP and QUIC diagnostic flows,
   though both use UDP, have similar issues regarding ECMP.  However, in
   situations where the entity doing the measurement can guarantee that
   the active measurement traffic will traverse the subpaths of interest
   (e.g.  residential access network measurement under a network
   architecture and business model where the network operator owns the
   CPE), active measurement can be used to generate RTT samples at the
   cost of at least two non-productive packets sent though the network
   per sample.

3.3.  Experimental Evaluation

   We have evaluated the effectiveness of the spin bit in an emulated
   network environment.  The spin bit was added to a fork of [MINQ],
   using the mechanism described in Section 2, but with the spin bit
   appearing in a measurement byte added to the header for passive
   measurability experiments.  Spin bit measurement support was added to
   [MOKUMOKUREN].  Full results of these ongoing experiments are
   available online in [SPINBIT-REPORT], but we summarize our findings
   here.

   First, we confirm that the spin bit works as advertised: it provides
   one useful RTT sample per RTT to any passive observer of the flow.
   This sample tracks each sender's local instantaneous estimate of RTT
   as well as the expected RTT (i.e., defined by the emulation) fairly
   well.  One surprising implication of this is that the spin bit
   provides _more_ information than is available by local estimation to



Trammell, et al.          Expires June 3, 2018                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                  Spin Bit                   November 2017


   an endpoint which is mostly receiving data frames and sending mainly
   ACKs, and as such can also be useful in purely endpoint-local
   observations of the RTT evolution during the flow.  The spin bit also
   works correctly under moderate to heavy packet loss and jitter.

   Second, we confirm that the spin bit can be easily implemented
   without requiring deep integration into a QUIC implementation.
   Indeed, it could be implemented completely independently, as a shim,
   aside from the requirement that the spin bit value be integrity-
   protected along with the rest of the QUIC header.

   Third, we performed experiments focused on the intermittent-sender
   problem described in Section 3.1.  We confirm that the spinbit does
   not provide useful RTT samples after the handshake when packets are
   only sent intermittently.  Simple heuristics can be used to recognize
   this situation, however, and to reject these RTT samples.  We also
   find that a simple sender-side heuristic can be used to determine
   whether a sample will be useful.  If a sender sends a packet more
   than a specified delay (e.g. 1ms) after the last packet received by
   the client, it knows that any latency spin observation of that packet
   will be invalid.  If a second "spin valid" bit were available, the
   sender could then mark that packet "spin invalid".  Our experiments
   show that this simple heuristic and spin validity bit are succesful
   in marking all packets whose RTT samples should be rejected.

   Fourth, we performed experiments focused on the reordering problem
   described in Section 3.1.  We find that while reordering can cause
   spurious samples at a naive observer, two simple approaches can be
   used to reject spurious RTT samples due to reordering.  First, a two-
   bit spin signal that always advances in a single direction (e.g. 00
   -> 01 -> 10 -> 11) successfully rejects all reordered samples,
   including under amounts of reordering that render the transport
   itself mostly useless.  However, adding a bit is not necessary:
   having the observer keep the least significant bits of the packet
   number, and rejecting samples from packets that do not advance by
   one, as suggested in Section 3.1, is essentially as successful as a
   two-bit spin signal in mitigating the effects of reordering on RTT
   measurement.

   Fifth, we performed parallel active measurements using ping, as
   described in Section 3.2.  In our emulated network, the ICMP packets
   and the QUIC packets traverse the same links with the same treatment,
   and share queues at each link, which mitigates most of the issues
   with ping.  We find that while ping works as expected in measuring
   end-to-end RTT, it does not track the sender's estimate of RTT, and
   as such does not measure the RTT experienced by the application layer
   as well as the spin bit does.

   In summary, our experiments show that the spin bit is suitable for
   purpose, can be implemented with minimal disruption, and that most of
   the problems identified with it in specific corner cases can be
   easily mitigated.  See [SPINBIT-REPORT] for more.

4.  Use Cases for Passive RTT Measurement

   This section describes use cases for passive RTT measurement.  Most
   of these are currently achieved with TCP, i.e., the matching of
   packets based on sequence and acknowledgment numbers, or timestamps
   and timestamp echoes, in order to generate upstream and downstream
   RTT samples which can be added to get end-to-end RTT.  These use
   cases could be achieved with QUIC by replacing sequence/
   acknowledgement and timestamp analysis with spin bit analysis, as
   described in Section 3.

   This section currently focuses one initial use case, interdomain
   troubleshooting.  Additional use cases will be added in future
   revisions; see https://github.com/britram/draft-trammell-spin-bit/
   issues for use cases we are currently considering.

   In any case, the measurement methodology follows one of a few basic
   variants:

   o  The RTT evolution of a flow or a set of flows can be compared to
      baseline or expected RTT measurements for flows with the same
      characterisitcs in order to detect or localize latency issues in a
      specific network.

   o  The RTT evolution of a single flow can also be examined in detail
      to diagnose performance issues with that flow.

   o  The spin bit can be used to generate a large number of samples of
      RTT for a flow aggregate (e.g., all flows between two given
      networks) without regard to temporal evolution of the RTT, in
      order to examine the distribution of RTTs for a group of flows
      that should have similar RTT (e.g., because they should share the
      same path(s)).

4.1.  Interdomain Troubleshooting

   Network access providers are often the first point of contact by
   their customers when network problems impact the performance of
   bandwidth-intensive and latency-sensitive applications such as video,
   regardless of whether the root cause lies within the access
   provider's network, the service provider's network, on the Internet
   paths between them, or within the customer's own network.

Internet-Draft                  Spin Bit                   November 2017


   Many residential networks use WiFi (802.11) on the last segment, and
   WiFi signal strength degradation manifests in high first-hop delay,
   due to the fact that the MAC layer will retransmit packets lost at
   that layer.  Measuring the RTT between endpoints on the customer
   network and parts of the service provider's own infrastructure (which
   have predictable delay characteristics) can be used to isolate this
   cause of performance problems.

   Comparing the evolution of passively-measured RTTs between a customer
   network and selected other networks on the Internet to short- and
   medium-term baseline measurements can similarly be used to isolate
   high latency to specific networks or network segments.  For example,
   if the RTTs of all flows to a given content provider increase at the
   same time, the problem likely exists between the access network and
   the content provider, or in the content provider's network itself.
   On the other hand, if the RTTs of all flows passing through the same
   access provider infrastructure change together, then the change is
   likely attributable to that infrastructure.

   These measurements are particularly useful for traffic which is
   latency sensitive, such as interactive video applications.  However,
   since high latency is often correlated with other network-layer
   issues such as chronic interconnect congestion [IMC-CONGESTION], it
   is useful for general troubleshooting of network layer issues in an
   interdomain setting.

   In this case, multiple RTT samples per flow are useful less for
   observing intraflow behavior, and more for generating sufficient
   samples for a given aggregate to make a high-quality measurement.

5.  Privacy and Security Considerations

   The privacy considerations for the latency spin bit are essentially
   the same as those for passive RTT measurement in general.

   A concern was raised during the discussion of this feature within the
   QUIC working group and the QUIC RTT Design Team that high-resolution
   RTT information might be usable for geolocation.  However, an
   evaluation based on RTT samples taken over 13,780 paths in the
   Internet from RIPE Atlas anchoring measurements [TRILAT] shows that
   the magnitude and uncertainty of RTT data render the resolution of
   geolocation information that can be derived from Internet RTT is
   limited to national- or continental-scale; i.e., less resolution than
   is generally available from free, open IP geolocation databases.

   One reason for the inaccuracy of geolocation from network RTT is that
   Internet backbone transmission facilities do not follow the great-
   circle path between major nodes.  Instead, major geographic features

   and the efficiency of connecting adjacent major cities influence the
   facility routing.  An evaluation of ~3500 measurements on a mesh of
   25 backbone nodes in the continental United States shows that 85% had
   RTT to great-circle error of 3ms or more, making location within US
   State boundaries ambigous [CONUS].

   Therefore, in the general case, when an endpoint's IP address is
   known, RTT information provides negligible additional information.

   RTT information may be used to infer the occupancy of queues along a
   path; indeed, this is part of its utility for performance measurement
   and diagnostics.  When a link on given path has excessive buffering
   (on the order of hundreds of milliseconds or more; a situation
   colloquially referred to as "bufferbloat"), such that the difference
   in delay between an empty queue and a full queue dwarfs normal
   variance and RTT along the path, RTT variance during the lifetime of
   a flow can be used to infer the presence of traffic on the bottleneck
   link.  In practice, however, this is not a concern for passive
   measurement of congestion-controlled traffic, since any observer in a
   situation to observe RTT passively need not infer the presence of the
   traffic, as it can observe it directly.

   In addition, since RTT information contains application as well as
   network delay, patterns in RTT variance from minimum, and therefore
   application delay, can be used to infer or fingerprint application-
   layer behavior.  However, as with the case above, this is not a
   concern with passive measurement, since the packet size and
   interarrival time sequence, which is also directly observable,
   carries more information than RTT variance sequence.

   We therefore conclude that the high-resolution, per-flow exposure of
   RTT for passive measurement as provided by the spin bit poses
   negligible marginal risk to privacy.

   As shown in Section 2, the spin bit can be implemented separately
   from the rest of the mechanisms of the QUIC transport protocol, as it
   requires no access to any state other than that observable in the
   QUIC packet header itself.  We recommend that implementations take
   advantage of this property, to reduce the risk that a errors in the
   implementation could leak private transport protocol state through
   the spin bit.

   Since the spin bit is disconnected from transport mechanics, a QUIC
   endpoint implementing the spin bit that has a model of the actual
   network RTT and a target RTT to expose can "lie" about its spin bit
   transitions, even without coordination with and the collusion of the
   other endpoint.  This is not the case with TCP, which requires
   coordination and collusion to expose false information via its

   sequence and acknowledgment numbers and its timestamp option.  When
   passive measurement is used for purposes where one endpoint might
   gain a material advantage by representing a false RTT, e.g.  SLA
   verification or enforcement of telecommunications regulations, this
   situation raises a question about the trustworthiness of spin bit RTT
   measurements.

   This issue must be appreciated by users of spin bit information, but
   mitigation is simple, as QUIC implementations designed to lie about
   RTT through spin bit modification are subject to dynamic analysis
   along paths with known RTTs.  We consider the ease of verification of
   lying in situations where this would be prohibited by regulation or
   contract, combined with the consequences of violation of said
   regulation or contract, to be a sufficient incentive in the general
   case not to do it.
