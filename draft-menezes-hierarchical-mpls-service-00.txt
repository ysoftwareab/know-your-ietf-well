   Abstract

   providers to deliver economical layer 2 VPN services using 
   hierarchical MPLS.  The service model builds on top of 2547 and

   BGP/MPLS and extends to building L2VPN services between customer 
   sites with a scalable peering model.  
    
   It reduces the cost of services for downstream providers by using a 
   distance-insensitive IP Network Service Provider (NSP) as a WAN 
   partner to connect distant regions.  It simplifies downstream 
   providerÆs operation and improves the scalability of a traditional 
   standard overlay model by allowing the downstream provider to peer 
   with the upstream provider for both Internet transit and L2VPN 
   services.

   2 Introduction 
    
   Traditionally, local exchange carriers buy Internet transit and VPN 
   services from Tier 1 service providers and resell such services to 
   enterprises or other customers.   
    
   To provide VPN services, one possibility is to use Frame Relay or 
   ATM circuits, but it is costly to lease large-circuit bandwidth over 
   long distances.  And it is also complex to operate both LAN and WAN 
   networks as LAN and WAN are often built on different technologies 
   such as Ethernet and SONET.   
    
   Another possibility is to use MPLS/VPN services which are typically 
   distance-insensitive.  To traffic engineer the network and to 
   provide QoS, VPN, and other services, the overlay model is typically 
   deployed (see Figure 1). In the overlay model, explicitly routed 
   MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs)are established end-to-end to form a 
   full-mesh virtual network on top of the underlying physical network.   
   This approach raises scalability concerns because it requires N^2

   square number of LSPs (where N is the number of sites being 
   connected), with routers at the end of these LSPs having routing 
   peering with each other; and it demands configuration changes at all 
   sites when a new site is added.  Also, it is more complex to design 
   and operate routing that spans not just individual sites but the 
   wide area as well.

                        Figure 1. Overlay Model 
    
    
    
   We propose a generic peering model (see Figure 2) that works for any 
   upstream and downstream providers.  The term upstream/downstream 
   provider is relative and upstream provider can be loosely defined as 
   the provider further away from the end users.  For simplicity, we 
   use the term National Service Provider or NSP as the upstream 
   provide for the rest of the document.  
    
   The peering model improves the scalability of the overlay model by 
   pushing the complexity of operating a WAN backbone to upstream 
   providers, thus reduces the operating cost of local exchange 
   carriers (LEC). In this model, a LEC router (CE) that connects the 
   LEC to a WAN has routing peering not with LEC routers in other sites 
   but with a WAN router (PE).  As a result of this peering, the LEC 
   router receives routing information for other sites, even if the 
   router doesnÆt have routing peering with LEC routers in other sites.  
   In addition, the NSP creates a collection of ôsink trees,ö where 
   each tree is rooted at a particular site with the rest of the sites

   forming leaves of that tree.  By using the hierarchical VPN approach 
   described in [2], the NSP could support multiple LECs.  Moreover, by 
   using the concept of MPLS label stacking, each LEC provider could 
   establish LSPs and interconnect routers in different sites without 
   introducing additional routing/forwarding overhead on the NSP.  
   Finally, the LEC could use MPLS label stacking to further reduce 
   routing/forwarding overhead within each LEC site.

   3 The Peering Model and Framework 
    
   To accommodate these requirements, this document proposes that a VPN 
   hierarchical model to be used, a model in which the lower hierarchy 
   is operated by the NSP and the higher hierarchy is made up of inter-
   site LEC services operated by the LEC.  Generation of these lower 
   hierarchical connections is the responsibility of the NSP and is 
   coordinated with the LEC via an automated procedure (which is the 
   purpose of this document).   
    
   This document focuses on MPLS as the technology for hierarchical 
   capability, the use of RFC 2547bis [2] as the mechanism that the NSP 
   would use internally to offer VPN services to the LEC, and the use 
   of BGP [3] to exchange both the routing and label information 
   between the NSP and the LEC.  An automated procedure, which is based 
   on the mechanisms described in [2] and [3], automates the NSPÆs 
   generation of inter-site LSPs that can be used by the LEC.  Other 
   mechanisms and standards that can be used to accommodate these same 
   requirements are for future study.

                   Figure 3. The Peering Model 
    
   In Figure 3, the NSP PE routers that connect to the LEC at each site 
   form peering relationships with the LEC routers (e.g., PE1 forms 
   routing peering with CE1) (this is a function of the NSPÆs VPN 
   services using RFC 2547bis [2]).  While the LEC may be under the 
   same administrative control for each site, we assume that the LEC in 
   each site forms a separate IGP domain.  The LEC CE router(s) in a 
   given site exchanges only with the PE router(s) of the NSP routes 
   and labels for the destinations that originate from that site. 
    
   When a site is added to the network, the CE router automatically 
   advertises to the NSP PE its routes for the destinations in that 
   site, as well as labels for these routes, by using BGP [3].  The NSP 
   PE routers in turn distribute the routes to their PE peers through 
   BGP, and each PE peer further delivers the routes to other CE 
   routers.  Other sitesÆ CE routers that are in the same virtual 
   private network as the new CE router will receive announcement of 
   the new CE router and, therefore, have an LSP connection back to 
   this new CE router and to other destinations reachable through this 
   router (these are the destinations in the site to which the router 
   belongs).  Thus, LSPs among CE routers are automatically 
   established, and these LSPs could be used as inter-site LEC 
   services.  It is important to note that these inter-site LSPs that 
   are generated by the NSP are hierarchical in nature, in the sense 
   that they could be used to carry all kinds of traffic, including 
   another higher-level LSP (which could be signaled by RSVP-TE or LDP) 
   or IP traffic or both.  Moreover, the procedures/protocols for 
   establishing the LSPs at one level of the hierarchy (e.g., inter-
   site service LSPs) need not be the same as the procedures/protocols 
   for establishing the LSPs at other levels of the hierarchy (e.g., 
   inter-site LSPs). 
    
    
   3.1 LSP Hierarchical Model 
    
   It is important to note the scalability achieved through 
   hierarchical LSPs.  For example, as shown in Figure 4, Ps of NSP 
   network only need to store labels to reach its PEs.  These PEs only 
   need to know how to reach the corresponding CEs that it services.  
     
   Menezes        Internet Draft - Expires Dec. 2002                 6 
   Hierarchal MPLS Services using 2547 and BGP/MPLS          June 2002 
    
   It is not necessary for the NSPÆs PEs to understand or care about 
   the inter-site service LSPs of the LECs.  The PEs in the NSPÆs 
   network do not see any label stack other than the inter-site LSP.  
   Therefore, when a LEC creates an inter-site service LSP from one 
   site to another across the NSP, the NSP has no state information for 
   that LSP (this is assuming that the inter-site service LSP is 
   created by using RSVP-TE).  Therefore, an NSP for a given PE can 
   accommodate many LEC customers in a scalable fashion. 
    
   Moreover, an inter-site service LSP could be used by a LEC to offer 
   services, such as Layer 2 VPNs, to multiple customers, thus further 
   improving the scalability of the approach.

   3.2 Class of Service Mapping 
    
   An important aspect of this service is for the NSP to offer CoS 
   capabilities so that SLAs within a LECÆs site also can be honored 
   for inter-site services.  To achieve this requirement, the markings 
   of any higher-level LSP (or IP packet) SHOULD be propagated to 
   lower-layer LSPs, including traffic-engineered LSPs that are within 
   the NSPÆs network.  This functionality offers great scalability 
   because as each packet (IP or MPLS) enters the NSPs network, it 
   carries with it a marking that indicates which CoS PHB [diff serv] 
   it needs.  Therefore, the propagation of the marking from higher-
   layer services to lower-layer LSPs is completely feasible as long as 
   a LEC enters into a bilateral CoS agreement with the NSP by

   4 Technical Details  
    
    
    
   As we mentioned above, the inter-site LSPs are created by following 
   the procedures described in Section 9 of [2].  In addition, this 
   document assumes that BGP is used as the protocol for exchanging 
   routing and label information between the PEs of the WAN provider 
   and the CE-ASBRs of the LEC(as specified in [3]).  Note that when a 
   CE-ASBR advertises a route to a WANÆs PE, the label associated with 
   this route should be Implicit NULL. 
    
   This document assumes that the inter-site service LSPs are 
   established by using RSVP-TE (however LDP could easily be used).  
   The RSVP-TE setups for these LSPs are carried by the NSP (including 
   the ingress and egress PEs of the NSP) as plain data; neither the 
   ingress nor the egress NSP PEs create any RSVP and/or labeling 
   states for these setups.  Doing this avoids the need for the NSP to 
   maintain state on a per inter-site service LSP basis.  This is key 
   to this proposal as this is what allows the NSP to offer 
   hierarchical MPLS services and yet scale to support tens of 
   thousands of LECs.  No state information is stored on the NSPs PEs. 
    
   The setups create RSVP and label state on the routers within LEC, 
   including the routers (CEs) that peer with the NSP routers but not 
   on any of the NSPÆs routers. 
    
   With respect to how one would construct the Explicit Route Object 
   (ERO) carried by the setups, there are several options.  One option 
   is for the LEC service provider to use some off-line tool to compute

   the EROs for the inter-site service LSPs.  Another alternative is to 
   compute the ERO on a per LEC basis.  Using the example shown in 
   Figure 4, with this alternative, PE1 in LEC1 would compute the ERO 
   for the segment of the path through LEC1, and CE2-ASBR would compute 
   the ERO for the segment of the path through LEC2.  
    
   For the purpose of handling the ERO carried in the setups, one 
   alternative is to assume that the LEC routers that peer with the NSP 
   routers are treated as being one hop away from each other.  Using 
   the example shown in Figure 4, for the purpose of handling the ERO 
   carried by the RSVP-TE setup for an inter-site service LSP from PE1 
   in LEC1 to PE2 in LEC2, CE1-ASBR and CE2-ASBR are treated as being 
   one hop from each other.  
    
   Another alternative for handling the ERO is to require that the 
   originator of an inter-site service LSP specify the hop over the NSP 
   network as a loose one.  Again, using the example shown in Figure 4, 
   PE1 in LEC1 would specify CE2-ASBR as a loose hop in the ERO. 
    
    
   5 Example of Operations 
    
   Consider the following topology 
    
        AS1 (LEC)  |  AS2 (WAN)   |  AS3 (LEC) 
    
      R1---R2---R3---R4--....--R5---R6---R7---R8 
    
   where AS2 provides WAN VPN services to a LEC service provider 
   composed of AS1 and AS3.  The routing protocol between R3 and R4 is 
   eBGP.  The same is true for R5 and R6.  
    
   R6 advertises to R5 (via eBGP) a single address prefix ("AS3 prefix") 
   that covers all the destinations in AS3 with itself as a next hop.  
   R6 advertises the "AS3 prefix" to R5 with an Implicit NULL label.  R5 
   advertises this prefix to R4 with label L2 and next-hop R5.  R4 
   advertises the prefix to R3 with label L1 and next-hop R4.  With this 
   in mind, the following illustrates MPLS forwarding associated with 
   the inter-site LSP (LSP from R3 to R6). 
    
        LSR     dest    action 
         
        R3      "AS3"   push L1 
        R4      L1      swap L1 with L2; push <something to reach R5> 
        R5      L2      pop L2, forward to R6 
         
   For the inter-site service LSP (R1-R8), the RSVP hops are R1, R2, R3, 
   R6, R7, and R8.  R{2,3,6,7} send RSVP labels M{1,2,3,4}, 
   respectively, to the previous hop.  With this in mind, the following 
   illustrates MPLS forwarding associated with the inter-site service 
   LSP (LSP from R1 to R8).

   6 Security Considerations 
    
   This document does not affect the underlying security issues of 
   MPLS and does not introduce any security considerations that are not 
   already part of the existing usage for LSPs.
