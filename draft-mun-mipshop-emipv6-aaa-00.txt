Abstract

   When Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) is deployed in commercial network, a mobile
   node needs AAA services for authentication, authorization and
   accounting. MIPv6 however does not provide any mean to authenticate
   mobile nodes that are roaming in different domains, although visited

   networks will need to check whether access of mobile nodes should be
   authorized or not. Hence schemes which support both AAA services and
   mobility have been emerged. These schemes enable access of the mobile
   node to be authorized by visited networks through AAA as well as to
   perform a home registration during AAA procedure. However, they
   introduce lots of signal messages and long handover latency during
   handover, since Route Optimization mode for MIPv6 is performed using
   Return Routability procedure. Especially long handover latency is a
   critical problem in real-time communication such as voice over IP
   (VoIP). To solve these problems, we propose an optimized scheme which
   performs Route Optimization mode using the AAA infrastructure between
   the home agent and a correspondent node instead of Return Routability
   procedure.

1. Introduction

   Mobile devices like laptops and PDAs are improved and wireless/mobile
   communications and networking are propagated widely. Then mobile
   users for real-time communication such as voice over IP (VoIP) have
   increased. Also, authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA)
   services are required for the users, since the mobile users may move
   between administrative domains.

   Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) [1] which supports mobility of a mobile node (MN)
   in IPv6 networks has been standardized by Internet Engineering Task
   Forces (IETF). When MIPv6 is deployed in commercial network, MNs need
   AAA services. AAA and MIPv6 are operated independently. Hence schemes
   which integrate these protocols have been emerged [2]-[4].

   In these schemes, when an MN moves between administrative domains, it
   is authenticated by AAA and its mobility is supported by MIPv6. Also,
   these schemes enable the MN to establish a security association
   between the MN and its home agent (HA), or to perform a home
   registration during AAA authentication procedure. However,
   these schemes introduce lots of signal messages and long handover
   latency during the handover, because Route Optimization mode for
   MIPv6 is performed by using Return Routability procedure. Return
   Routability procedure consists of Home of Test Init (HoTI) / Home of
   Test (HoT) and Care-of Test Init (CoTI) / Care-of Test (CoT)
   messages.

   To solve these problems, we propose an optimized scheme for Route
   Optimization mode by using the AAA infrastructure between the HA and
   a correspondent node (CN) instead of Return Routability procedure.
   When the MN performs AAA procedure, it embeds a home Binding Update
   (BU) message and the CN's information (address and the Network Access
   Identifier (NAI) [5]) in a request message of AAA procedure. The BU
   message and the CN's information are delivered to the HA through AAA
   procedure. After the HA performs the home binding update, it creates
   a BU message to the CN for Route Optimization mode. The HA then sends
   the BU message to the CN via the AAA infrastructure between itself
   and the CN.

   The proposed scheme can reduce signal messages and handover latency
   during the handover, because Return Routability procedure for Route
   Optimization mode is not performed. The proposed scheme also can get
   a security benefit for Route Optimization mode, since it uses the AAA
   infrastructure which is secured by IPsec [6] and TLS [7].

2. Terminology

   This document borrows all of the terminology from Mobile IPv6 [1] and
   AAA for Mobile MIPv6 [3].

      Attendant: AAA entity which is the local AAA system entry point
                 and the local address provider/registry. Term from [8].

      AAA client: attendant.

      AAA home server (AAAH): AAA server of the home network.
 
      AAA local server (AAAL): AAA server of the local network.

      AVP (Attribute Value Pair): AAA (element of) payload.

      Binding: home address/care-of address association for a mobile
                   node on a mobility aware IPv6 node.

      Care-of address (Co@): temporary address used by a mobile node.
               The care-of address is allocated or registered by a local
               entity which is assumed for simplicity in this document
               to be the same than the attendant.

      Home address (H@): fixed address used by a mobile node.
               The home address belongs to the home network and is in
               general well known by the mobile node even if the
               protocol described here supports home address allocation.

      Home agent (HA): router on the home network which forwards
               traffic at the destination of the home address to the
               mobile node.

      Mobile Node (MN): node using mobile IPv6 mechanisms.

      Correspondent Node (CN)
               A IPv6 host communicating with MN.

      Network Access Identifier (NAI): [5] mobile user identifier
               which is compatible with user_FQDN identities of IKE.
               We assume NAI can be used to identify any entity involved
               here even if some of them are nodes and not users.
   
      Security Association (SA): a security connection which affords
               security services to some traffic between peers.
               This notion is shared between IPsec, ISAKMP and AAA
               over different forms.

      Access Router (AR)
               The MN's default router.

      Handover
               A process of terminating existing connectivity and
               obtaining new IP connectivity.

      Router Solicitation for Proxy Advertisement (RtSolPr)
               A message from the MN to the PAR requesting information
               for a potential handover.

      Proxy Router Advertisement (PrRtAdv)
               A message from the PAR to the MN that provides
               information about neighboring links facilitating
               expedited movement detection.  The message also acts as a
               trigger for network-initiated handover.


3. Background Information

3.1. Mobile IPv6

   MIPv6 protocol enables an MN to keep connections to an HA and a CN,
   although the MN changes a point of attachment to network. In MIPv6
   the MN has two addresses of a home address (HoA) and a care-of
   address (CoA). The HoA is generated in a home network, which never be
   changed although the MN enters another network, and hence the HA and
   the CN identify the MN as the HoA. The CoA is generated in a visited
   network whenever it moves, and represents a current location. MIPv6
   protocol binds the CoA to the HoA.

   In MIPv6 the MN uses Route Optimization mode consisting of Return
   Routability procedure and a binding update to the CN to communicate
   with the CN directly. Return Routability procedure consists of HoTI/
   HoT and CoTI/CoT message, and through this procedure a key between
   the MN and the CN is generated, and then a BU message to the CN is
   authenticated by the generated key. Figure 1 shows Route Optimization
   mode of MIPv6.

   In Fig. 1, HoTI message is sent to the CN through the HA, and CoTI
   message is sent to the CN directly. The CN then processes these
   messages respectively and sends response messages to the sender. That
   is, the CN sends HoT and CoTI messages to the MN as a result of
   processing HoTI and CoTI messages, respectively. When the MN receives
   HoT and CoT messages, it generates a binding management key (Kbm)
   using keygen tokens in HoT and CoT messages. Then the MN sends the BU
   message to CN to inform its new CoA, and the BU message is
   authenticated by the Kbm. After updating binding information in the

   CN, the MN and the CN can communicate directly. As a result, Route
   Optimization mode is completed.

               Fig. 1. Mobile IPv6 Route Optimization mode


   Whenever the MN moves between networks, a process for mobility
   support is required and is called a handover. The handover consists
   of a movement detection, an address configuration, a home binding
   update, Return Routability procedure, and a binding update to the CN
   [1]. The MN cannot communicate with the CN during the handover.


3.2. MIPv6 with AAA

   When MIPv6 is deployed in commercial networks, the MN needs AAA [8]
   services to allow it to access to any service provided by an
   administrative domain different from its home domain. AAA supports
   authentication and authorization for the MN and collects MN's
   accounting information [9]. AAA is a distributed security model which
   consists of distributed clients and central servers. In AAA, all of
   connections between entities are secured by IPsec and additionally by
   TLS.

   Figure 2 shows the architecture of MIPv6 with AAA. In Fig. 2, the
   paths between the AAAL and the AAAH are secured by IPsec and
   additionally TLS. It is similar to the paths between the AAAH and the
   HA and the paths between the AAAL and the AAA Attendant. The local
   network is a network where the MN currently resides. The AAA
   Attendant may be implemented at the AR.

                        Fig. 2. AAA Schema


   In Fig. 2, AAAH is an AAA server of the MN¡¯s home network, AAAL is an
   AAA server of the local network, and AAA Attendant is AAA entity which
   is local AAA system entry point and the local address provider/
   registry [3].

   When the MN moves into a foreign domain, it needs authorization to
   attach to the foreign domain. Hence AAA plays a role to enable the MN
   to get access in the foreign domain. After getting the access
   permission to the foreign domain through AAA, MIPv6 is performed to
   support mobility. These two protocols are performed in order, so both
   signal overhead and handover latency are increased. Schemes which
   integrate two protocols have studied to solve these problems.

   In this draft, we describe two schemes to combine MIPv6 and AAA. We
   also focus on the message flow of two schemes. Hence we do not
   discuss AAA protocol or the message types.


3.2.1. Francis Dupont's Scheme

   In Dupont¡¯s draft [3], the author describes a solution that allows
   the AAA infrastructure to authenticate/authorize an MN, and to create
   credentials for securing subsequent AAA exchanges and MIPv6
   registration messages. The original idea is that the MN is allowed to
   dynamically establish a security association pair with its HA during
   AAA exchanges using AAA infrastructure as a trusted third party [3].

   In this draft we focus on the message flow for Dupont¡¯s scheme, and
   it is shown in Fig. 3.

              Fig. 3. The message flow for Dupont's scheme


   In Fig. 3 procedures of AAA and MIPv6 are performed when the MN moves
   a foreign network. The MN performs AAA procedure to get access to the
   network and then it performs MIPv6 procedure to support its mobility.
   These procedures are performed sequentially. After registration to
   the HA, the MN sets up Route Optimization mode to communicate
   directly with CNs.


3.2.2. Reen-Cheng Wang's Scheme

   In Wang¡¯s paper [2], the author proposes a mechanism combining MIPv6
   and AAA which are performed in a common procedure. Figure 4 shows the
   message flow for Wang¡¯s scheme when the MN moves into a foreign
   network. In Fig. 4 MIP Reg. Req. is Mobile IPv6 Registration Request
   message which requests AAA authentication and Mobile IPv6
   registration, and MIP Reg. Reply is Mobile IPv6 Registration Reply
   message which replies the result of the request message.

   When the MN moves into a foreign network and receives the router
   advertisement, it will send a registration request to the attendant.
   The attendant will forward the message to the AAAH server via AAAL
   server to check the user¡¯s identity. After the AAAH server checks the
   user¡¯s identity, it will send a MIP registration message to the HA.
   The HA will send a registration reply message to the AAAH server,
   which waits for the AAA message. After the message from the HA is
   received, the AAA server will forward the result to the attendant.
   The attendant will send the registration reply message to the MN.

   After the registration to the HA, the MN uses Route Optimization mode
   to communicate directly with CNs.


4. Proposed Protocol Details

4.1. Problem Description

   Wang's scheme among the existing schemes can optimize a handover,
   since the AAA infrastructure can be used to support mobility
   procedures and to optimize authentication, authorization and mobility
   in a common procedure. However Wang's scheme must also perform Return
   Routability procedure for Route Optimization mode. Hence, handover
   latency is long and signaling overhead is large, due to many signal
   messages used in Return Routability procedure.


4.1. An Optimized Scheme for Route Optimization Mode

   To solve problems mentioned above, we propose an optimized scheme for
   Route Optimization mode by using the AAA infrastructure between the
   HA and a CN instead of Return Routability procedure. When the MN

   requests AAA authentication, it embeds a home BU message and the CN's
   information (address and NAI) in a request message of AAA procedure.
   When the HA receives the BU message and CN's information via the AAA
   infrastructure, it performs the home binding update and creates a BU
   message to the CN. The HA then sends the BU message to the CN via the
   AAA infrastructure between itself and the CN.

   For the proposed scheme, we assume the followings. The CN is being
   supported by AAA. When the MN sends the request message to an AAA
   Attendant, the CN's address and NAI are embedded in the message. The
   MN can know the CN's NAI using an appropriate manner in advance. The
   HA can create a registration message to the CN, substituting the MN.

            Fig. 5. The message flow for the proposed scheme


   Figure 5 shows message flows of the proposed scheme. Whole procedure
   for the proposed scheme is similar to Wang¡¯s scheme except a
   procedure for setting up Route Optimization mode.

   When receiving the MIPv6 registration request message from AAAH, the
   HA processes the message and creates a response message. The HA then
   creates a BU message for the CN with the MN's CoA as the source IP
   address, the CN's address as the destination IP address, and the MN's
   HoA as the home address option. The HA then sends an AAA request
   message including a BU to CN's NAI to register the MN¡¯s new location.
   Upon receipt of the AAA message, the CN processes the message, and
   then BCE for the MN is updated. Finally, Route Optimization mode is
   completed and the MN and the CN can communicate directly.

   The proposed scheme does not need Return Routability procedure for
   Route Optimization mode, because the mode is completed via the AAA
   infrastructure. Therefore, the proposed scheme can reduce handover
   latency and signaling overhead.


5. Message Formats

   To be defined.


6. Security Considerations

   In this draft, AAA infrastrucure are secured by IPsec and TLS. 
   Hence, it is assumed that messages exchanging in AAA infrastructure
   are secured. However, obviously a deep security review is needed.


7. Conclusions

   MIPv6 protocol does not provide any specific support for mobility
   passing through different administrative domains, and hence it limits
   the applicability of MIPv6 in a large scale commercial deployment.
   For MIPv6 to be deployed in commercial networks there has to be AAA
   support for the protocol. Wang's scheme provides a solution for MIPv6
   and AAA interworking. It also can support a fast handover, since it
   enables an MN to establish a security association between the MN and
   an HA, and to perform a home binding update through AAA procedure.
   However, Wang's scheme introduces a lot of signal messages and long
   handover latency during the handover, since Route Optimization mode
   is performed using Return Routability procedure.

   To solve this problem, we propose an optimized scheme for Route
   Optimization mode that the HA performs the binding update for a CN by
   using the AAA infrastructure between the HA and the CN instead of
   Return Routability procedure. The proposed scheme can reduce handover
   latency and signaling overhead during the handover, because Return
   Routability procedure for Route Optimization mode is not performed.
   The proposed scheme also can get a security benefit, since it uses
   the AAA infrastructure which is secured by IPsec and TLS. Since the
   proposed scheme causes shorter handover latency than the existing
   schemes, it may be suitable to support real-time communication such
   as VoIP.

   Fast Handover for Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6) [10] and Hierarchical MIPv6
   (HMIPv6) [11] have been standardized in IETF. FMIPv6 is an enhanced
   handover scheme for MIPv6, as portions of layer 3 handover are
   performed layer 2 handover. HMIPv6 reduces location updates, since
   mobility is managed locally. Therefore, the proposed scheme can be

   considered to be used in FMIPv6 or HMIPv6, since these mechanisms
   have enhanced MIPv6.
