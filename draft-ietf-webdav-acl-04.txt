 Abstract 

 This document specifies a set of methods, headers, and message bodies 
 that define the WebDAV Access Control extensions to the HTTP/1.1 
 protocol. This protocol permits a client to remotely read and modify 
 access control lists that instruct a server whether to grant or deny 
 operations upon a resource (such as HTTP method invocations) by a given 
 principal.

 1  INTRODUCTION 

   The goal of the WebDAV access control extensions is to provide an 
   interoperable mechanism for handling discretionary access control 
   for content in WebDAV servers.  WebDAV access control can be 
   implemented on content repositories with security as simple as that 
   of a UNIX file system, as well as more sophisticated models.  The 
   underlying principle of access control is that who you are 
   determines how you can access a resource. The "who you are" is 
   defined by a "principal" identifier; users, client software, 
   servers, and groups of the previous have principal identifiers. The 
   "how" is determined by a single "access control list" (ACL) 
   associated with a resource.  An ACL contains a set of "access 
   control entries" (ACEs), where each ACE specifies a principal and a 
   set of privileges that are either granted or denied to that 
   principal. When a principal submits an operation (such as an HTTP or 
   WebDAV method) to a resource for execution, the server evaluates the 
   ACEs in the ACL to determine if the principal has permission for 
   that operation. 

   This specification intentionally omits discussion of authentication, 
   as the HTTP protocol already has a number of authentication 
   mechanisms [RFC2617].  Some authentication mechanism (such as HTTP 
   Digest Authentication, which all WebDAV compliant implementations 
   are required to support) must be available to validate the identity 
   of a principal.  

   In the interests of timeliness, the following set of security 
   mechanisms are not addressed by this document: 



 Clemm, Hopkins, Sedlar, Whitehead                            [Page 3] 

 INTERNET-DRAFT                 WebDAV ACL             January 21, 2001 

        * Access control that applies only to a particular property on 
          a resource, rather than the entire resource, 

        * Role-based security (where a role can be seen as a 
          dynamically defined collection of principals), 

        * Specification of the ways an ACL on a resource is 
          initialized, 

        * Specification of an ACL that applies globally to a method, 
          rather than to a particular resource. 

   This specification is organized as follows. Section 1.1 defines key 
   concepts used throughout the specification, and is followed by more 
   in-depth discussion of principals (Section 2), and privileges 
   (Section 3). Properties defined on principals are specified in 
   Section 4, and access control properties for content resources are 
   specified in Section 5. The semantics of access control lists are 
   described in Section 6, including sections on ACE combination 
   (Section 6.1), ACE ordering (Section 6.2), and principals required 
   to be present in an ACE (Section 6.3). Client discovery of access 
   control capability using OPTIONS is described in Section 7.1, and 
   the access control setting method, ACL, is specified in Section 8. 
   Internationalization considerations (Section 9) and security 
   considerations (Section 10) round out the specification. An appendix 
   (Section 17.1) provides an XML Document Type Definition (DTD) for 
   the XML elements defined in the specification. 

 1.1 Terms 

   This draft uses the terms defined in HTTP [RFC2616] and WebDAV 
   [RFC2518].  In addition, the following terms are defined: 

   principal 

   A "principal" is a distinct human or computational actor that 
   initiates access to network resources.  In this protocol, a 
   principal is an HTTP resource that represents such an actor. 

   principal collection 

   A "principal collection" is a group of principals, and is 
   represented in this protocol by a WebDAV collection containing HTTP 
   resources that represent principals, and principal collections. 

   privilege 

   A "privilege" controls access to a particular set of HTTP operations 
   on a resource. 

   aggregate privilege  

   An "aggregate privilege" is a privilege that contains a set of other 
   privileges. 

   abstract privilege 


 Clemm, Hopkins, Sedlar, Whitehead                            [Page 4] 

 INTERNET-DRAFT                 WebDAV ACL             January 21, 2001 

   The modifier "abstract", when applied to an atomic or aggregate 
   privilege, means the privilege cannot be set in an access control 
   element (ace).  

   access control list (acl) 

   An "acl" is a list of access control elements that define access 
   control to a particular resource. 

   access control element (ace) 

   An "ace" either grants or denies a particular set of (non-abstract) 
   privileges for a particular principal. 

   inherited ace 

   An "inherited ace" is an ace that is shared from the acl of another 
   resource. 

 1.2 Notational Conventions 

   The augmented BNF used by this document to describe protocol 
   elements is described in Section 2.1 of [RFC2616]. Because this 
   augmented BNF uses the basic production rules provided in Section 
   2.2 of [RFC2616], those rules apply to this document as well. 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

 2  PRINCIPALS 

   A principal is an HTTP resource that represents a distinct human or 
   computational actor that initiates access to network resources.  On 
   many implementations, users and groups are represented as 
   principals; other types of principals are also possible.   Although 
   an implementation MAY support PROPFIND and PROPPATCH to access and 
   modify information about a principal, it is not required to do so.   

   A principal resource may or may not be a collection.  A collection 
   principal may only contain other principals (not other types of 
   resources).  Servers that support aggregation of principals (e.g. 
   groups of users or other groups) MUST manifest them as collection 
   principals.  The WebDAV methods for examining and maintaining 
   collections (e.g. DELETE, PROPFIND) MAY be used to maintain 
   collection principals.  Membership in a collection principal is 
   recursive, so a principal in a collection principal GRPA contained 
   by collection principal GRPB is a member of both GRPA and GRPB.  
   Implementations not supporting recursive membership in principal 
   collections can return an error if the client attempts to bind 
   collection principals into other collection principals. 

 3  PRIVILEGES 

   Ability to perform a given method on a resource SHOULD be controlled 
   by one or more privileges.  Authors of protocol extensions that 


 Clemm, Hopkins, Sedlar, Whitehead                            [Page 5] 

 INTERNET-DRAFT                 WebDAV ACL             January 21, 2001 

   define new HTTP methods SHOULD specify which privileges (by defining 
   new privileges, or mapping to ones below) are required to perform 
   the method.  A principal with no privileges to a resource SHOULD be 
   denied any HTTP access to that resource. 

   Privileges may be containers of other privileges, in which case they 
   are termed aggregate privileges.  If a principal is granted or 
   denied an aggregate privilege, it is semantically equivalent to 
   granting or denying each of the aggregated privileges individually.  
   For example, an implementation may define add-member and remove-
   member privileges that control the ability to add and remove an 
   internal member of a collection.  Since these privileges control the 
   ability to update the state of a collection, these privileges would 
   be aggregated by the DAV:write privilege on a collection, and 
   granting the DAV:write privilege on a collection would also grant 
   the add-member and remove-member privileges. 

   Privileges may have the quality of being abstract, in which case 
   they cannot be set in an ACE. Aggregate and atomic privileges are 
   both capable of being abstract. Abstract privileges are useful for 
   modeling privileges that otherwise would not be exposed via the 
   protocol. Abstract privileges also provide server implementations 
   with flexibility in implementing the privileges defined in this 
   specification.  For example, if a server is incapable of separating 
   the read resource capability from the read ACL capability, it can 
   still model the DAV:read and DAV:read-acl privileges defined in this 
   specification by declaring them abstract, and containing them within 
   a non-abstract aggregate privilege (say, read-all) that holds 
   DAV:read, and DAV:read-acl. In this way, it is possible to set the 
   aggregate privilege, read-all, thus coupling the setting of DAV:read 
   and DAV:read-acl, but it is not possible to set DAV:read, or 
   DAV:read-acl individually. Since aggregate privileges can be 
   abstract, it is also possible to use abstract privileges to group 
   and classify non-abstract privileges.  

   The set of privileges that apply to a particular resource may vary 
   with the DAV:resourcetype of the resource, as well as between 
   different server implementations.  To promote interoperability, 
   however, WebDAV defines a set of well-known privileges (e.g. 
   DAV:read and DAV:write), which can at least be used to classify the 
   other privileges defined on a particular resource. 

 3.1 DAV:read Privilege 

   The read privilege controls methods that return information about 
   the state of the resource, including the resource's properties. 
   Affected methods include GET and PROPFIND.  Additionally, the read 
   privilege MAY control the OPTIONS method. 

      <!ELEMENT read EMPTY> 

 3.2 DAV:write Privilege 

   The write privilege controls methods that modify the state of the 
   resource, such as PUT and PROPPATCH.  Note that state modification 


 Clemm, Hopkins, Sedlar, Whitehead                            [Page 6] 

 INTERNET-DRAFT                 WebDAV ACL             January 21, 2001 

   is also controlled via locking (see section 5.3 of [WEBDAV]), so 
   effective write access requires that both write privileges and write 
   locking requirements are satisfied. 

      <!ELEMENT write EMPTY> 

 3.3 DAV:read-acl Privilege 

   The DAV:read-acl privilege controls the use of PROPFIND to retrieve 
   the DAV:acl, and DAV:current-user-privilege-set properties of the 
   resource. 

      <!ELEMENT read-acl EMPTY> 

 3.4 DAV:write-acl Privilege 

   The DAV:write-acl privilege controls use of the ACL method to modify 
   the DAV:acl property of the resource. 

      <!ELEMENT write-acl EMPTY> 

 3.5 DAV:all Privilege 

   DAV:all is an aggregate privilege that contains all privileges on 
   the resource. 

      <!ELEMENT all EMPTY> 

 4  PRINCIPAL PROPERTIES 

   Principals are manifested to clients as an HTTP resource, identified 
   by a URL.  A principal MUST have a DAV:displayname property.  This 
   protocol defines the following additional properties for a 
   principal. 

 4.1 DAV:is-principal 

   This property indicates whether this resource is a principal.  A 
   resource MUST have a non-empty DAV:is-principal property if and only 
   if it is a principal resource.   (Note: If we can just add a 
   DAV:principal element to the DAV:resourcetype property, then we do 
   not need a DAV:is-principal property.) 

      <!ELEMENT is-principal (#PCDATA)> 
      PCDATA value: any non-empty value ("T" is suggested) 

 4.2 DAV:authentication-id 

   A property containing the name used to authenticate this principal 
   (typically typed into a login prompt/dialog). 

      <!ELEMENT authentication-id (#PCDATA)> 
      PCDATA value: any string 




 Clemm, Hopkins, Sedlar, Whitehead                            [Page 7] 

 INTERNET-DRAFT                 WebDAV ACL             January 21, 2001 

 5  ACCESS CONTROL PROPERTIES 

   This specification defines a number of new properties for WebDAV 
   resources.  Access control properties may be retrieved just like 
   other WebDAV properties, using the PROPFIND method.  Some access 
   control properties (such as DAV:owner) MAY be updated with the 
   PROPPATCH method.   

   HTTP resources that support the WebDAV Access Control Protocol MUST 
   contain the following properties: 

 5.1 DAV:owner 

   This property identifies a particular principal as being the "owner" 
   of the resource. 

      <!ELEMENT owner (href prop?)> 
      <!ELEMENT prop (see [RFC2518], section 12.11)> 
       
   An implementation MAY include a list of selected properties of that 
   principal resource.  Which properties (if any) are included is 
   implementation defined.  An implementation MAY allow the use of 
   PROPPATCH to update the DAV:owner field. 

 5.2 DAV:supported-privilege-set 

   This is a read-only property that identifies the privileges defined 
   for the resource.   

      <!ELEMENT supported-privilege-set (supported-privilege*)> 
       
   Each privilege appears as an XML element, where aggregate privileges 
   list as sub-elements all of the privileges that they aggregate. 

      <!ELEMENT supported-privilege 
       (privilege, abstract?, description, supported-privilege*)> 
      <!ELEMENT privilege ANY> 
       
   An abstract privilege of a resource MUST NOT be used in an ACE for 
   that resource. Servers MUST fail an attempt to set an abstract 
   privilege. 

      <!ELEMENT abstract EMPTY> 
       
   A description is a human-readable description of what this privilege 
   controls access to.  

      <!ELEMENT description #PCDATA> 
       
   It is envisioned that a WebDAV ACL-aware administrative client would 
   list the supported privileges in a dialog box, and allow the user to 
   choose non-abstract privileges to apply in an ACE.  The privileges 
   tree is useful programmatically to map well-known privileges 
   (defined by WebDAV or other standards groups) into privileges that 
   are supported by any particular server implementation.  The 


 Clemm, Hopkins, Sedlar, Whitehead                            [Page 8] 

 INTERNET-DRAFT                 WebDAV ACL             January 21, 2001 

   privilege tree also serves to hide complexity in implementations 
   allowing large number of privileges to be defined by displaying 
   aggregates to the user. 

 5.3 DAV:current-user-privilege-set 

   DAV:current-user-privilege-set is a read-only property containing 
   the exact set of privileges (as computed by the server) granted to 
   the currently authenticated HTTP user.  A user-agent can use the 
   value of this property to adjust its user interface to make actions 
   inaccessible (e.g, by graying out a menu item or button) for which 
   the current principal does not have permission. This is particularly 
   useful for an access control user interface, which can be 
   constructed without knowing the ACE combining semantics of the 
   server. This property is also useful for determine what operations 
   can be performed by the current principal, without having to 
   actually execute an operation. 

      <!ELEMENT current-user-privilege-set (privilege*)> 
      <!ELEMENT privilege ANY> 
       
   If the current user is granted a specific privilege, that privilege 
   must belong to the set of privileges that may be set on this 
   resource. Therefore, each element in the DAV:current-user-privilege-
   set property MUST identify a privilege from the DAV:supported-
   privilege-set property. 

 5.4 DAV:acl 

   This property specifies the list of access control entries (ACEs), 
   which define what principals are to get what privileges for this 
   resource. 

      <!ELEMENT acl (ace*)> 
       
   Each DAV:ace element specifies the set of privileges to be either 
   granted or denied to a single principal.  If the DAV:acl property is 
   empty, no principal is granted any privilege. 

      <!ELEMENT ace (principal, (grant|deny), protected?, inherited?)> 
       
   An attempt to update the DAV:acl property with a PROPPATCH MUST 
   fail. 

 5.4.1 ACE Principal 

   The DAV:principal element identifies the principal to which this ACE 
   applies. 

      <!ELEMENT principal ((href, prop?) 
       | all | authenticated | unauthenticated 
       | property | self)> 
       
   The current user matches DAV:href only if that user is authenticated 
   as being (or being a member of) the principal identified by the URL 

 Clemm, Hopkins, Sedlar, Whitehead                            [Page 9] 

 INTERNET-DRAFT                 WebDAV ACL             January 21, 2001 

   contained by that DAV:href.   An implementation MAY include a 
   DAV:prop element after the DAV:href element, containing a list of 
   selected properties of that principal resource.  Which properties 
   (if any) are included in the DAV:prop element is implementation 
   defined.  The DAV:prop element is primarily intended for 
   implementations that do not support PROPFIND requests on the 
   principal URL. 

      <!ELEMENT prop (see [RFC2518], section 12.11)> 
       
   The current user always matches DAV:all.  

      <!ELEMENT all EMPTY> 
       
   The current user matches DAV:authenticated only if authenticated. 

      <!ELEMENT authenticated EMPTY> 
       
   The current user matches DAV:unauthenticated only if not 
   authenticated. 

      <!ELEMENT unauthenticated EMPTY> 
       
   DAV:all is the union of DAV:authenticated, and DAV:unauthenticated. 
   For a given request, the user matches either DAV:authenticated, or 
   DAV:unauthenticated, but not both. 

   The current user matches a DAV:property principal in a DAV:acl 
   property of a resource only if the identified property of that 
   resource contains a DAV:href that identifies a principal, and the 
   current user is authenticated as being (or being a member of) that 
   principal.  For example, if the DAV:property element contained 
   <DAV:owner/>, the current user would match the DAV:property 
   principal only if the current user is authenticated as matching the 
   principal identified by the DAV:owner property of the resource. 

      <!ELEMENT property ANY> 
       
   The current user matches DAV:self in a DAV:acl property of the 
   resource only if that resource is a principal object and the current 
   user is authenticated as being that principal. 

      <!ELEMENT self EMPTY> 

 5.4.2 ACE Grant and Deny 

   Each DAV:grant or DAV:deny element specifies the set of privileges 
   to be either granted or denied to the specified principal.  A 
   DAV:grant or DAV:deny element of the DAV:acl of a resource MUST only 
   contain elements specified in the DAV:supported-privilege-set of 
   that resource. 

      <!ELEMENT grant (privilege+)> 
      <!ELEMENT deny (privilege+)> 
      <!ELEMENT privilege ANY> 


 Clemm, Hopkins, Sedlar, Whitehead                            [Page 10] 

 INTERNET-DRAFT                 WebDAV ACL             January 21, 2001 

 5.4.3 ACE Protection 

   If an ACE contains a DAV:protected element, an ACL request without 
   that ACE MUST fail. 

      <!ELEMENT protected EMPTY> 

 5.4.4 ACE Inheritance 

   The presence of a DAV:inherited element indicates that this ACE is 
   inherited from another resource that is identified by the URL 
   contained in a DAV:href element.  An inherited ACE cannot be 
   modified directly, but instead the ACL on the resource from which it 
   is inherited must be modified. 

   Note that ACE inheritance is not the same as ACL initialization.  
   ACL initialization defines the ACL that a newly created resource 
   will use (if not specified).  ACE inheritance refers to an ACE that 
   is logically shared - where an update to the resource containing an 
   ACE will affect the ACE of each resource that inherits that ACE.  
   The method by which ACLs are initialized or by which ACEs are 
   inherited is not defined by this document. 

      <!ELEMENT inherited (href)> 

 5.5 DAV:acl-semantics 

   This is a read-only property that defines the ACL semantics.  These 
   semantics define how multiple ACEs that match the current user are 
   combined, what  are the constraints on how ACEs can be ordered, and 
   which principals must have an ACE. 

   Since it is not practical to require all implementations to use the 
   same ACL semantics, the DAV:acl-semantics property is used to 
   identify the ACL semantics for a particular resource.  The DAV:acl-
   semantics element is defined in section 6. 

 5.6 DAV:principal-collection-set 

   This read-only property contains zero, one, or more URLs that 
   identify a collection principal. It is expected that implementations 
   of this protocol will typically employ a relatively small number of 
   locations in the URL namespace for principal, and collection 
   principals. In cases where this assumption holds, the DAV:principal-
   collection-set property will contain a small set of URLs identifying 
   the top of collection hierarchy containing multiple principals and 
   collection principals. An access control protocol user agent could 
   use the contents of DAV:principal-collection-set to, for example, 
   query the DAV:displayname property (specified in Section 13.2 of 
   [RFC2518]) of all principals on that server, thereby yielding human-
   readable names for each principal that could be displayed in a user 
   interface.

      <!ELEMENT principal-collection-set (href*)> 
    

   Since different servers can control different parts of the URL 
   namespace, different resources on the same host MAY have different 
   DAV:principal-collection-set values. The collections specified in 
   the DAV:principal-collection-set MAY be located on different hosts 
   from the resource. The URLs in DAV:principal-collection-set are not 
   limited to http scheme URLs, and can, for example, be ldap scheme 
   URLs. For security and scalability reasons, a server MAY report only 
   a subset of the entire set of known collection principals, and 
   therefore clients should not assume they have retrieved an 
   exhaustive listing. Additionally, a server MAY elect to report none 
   of the collection principals it knows about. 

 5.7 Example: PROPFIND to retrieve access control properties 

   The following example shows how access control information can be 
   retrieved by using the PROPFIND method to fetch the values of the 
   DAV:owner, DAV:supported-privilege-set, DAV:current-user-privilege-
   set, and DAV:acl properties.

   The value of the DAV:owner property is a single DAV:href XML element 
   containing the URL of the principal that owns this resource.  

   The value of the DAV:supported-privilege-set property is a tree of 
   supported privileges: 

        DAV:acl (aggregate, abstract) 
            | 
          +-- DAV:read 
          +-- DAV:write (aggregate, abstract) 
               | 
               +-- http://www.acl.org/create 
               +-- http://www.acl.org/update 
               +-- http://www.acl.org/delete 
            +-- DAV:read-acl 
            +-- DAV:write-acl 
    

   The DAV:current-user-privilege-set property contains two privileges, 
   DAV:read, and DAV:read-acl. This indicates that the current 
   authenticated user only has the ability to read the resource, and 
   read the DAV:acl property on the resource. 

   The DAV:acl property contains a set of four ACEs: 

   ACE #1: The principal identified by the URL 
   http://www.foo.org/users/esedlar is granted the DAV:read, DAV:write, 
   and DAV:read-acl privileges. 

   ACE #2: The principals identified by the URL 
   http://www.foo.org/groups/marketing/ are denied the DAV:read 
   privilege.  In this example, the principal URL identifies a group, 
   which is represented by a collection principal. 

 Clemm, Hopkins, Sedlar, Whitehead                            [Page 14] 

 INTERNET-DRAFT                 WebDAV ACL             January 21, 2001 

   ACE #3: In this ACE, the principal is a property principal, 
   specifically the DAV:owner property. When evaluating this ACE, the 
   value of the DAV:owner property is retrieved, and is examined to see 
   if it contains a DAV:href XML element. If so, the URL within the 
   DAV:href element is read, and identifies a principal. In this ACE, 
   the owner is granted DAV:read-acl, and DAV:write-acl privileges. 

   ACE #4: This ACE grants the DAV:all principal (all users) the 
   DAV:read privilege. This ACE is inherited from the resource 
   http://www.foo.org/top/, the parent collection of this resource. 

 6  ACL SEMANTICS 

   The ACL semantics define how multiple ACEs that match the current 
   user are combined, what are the constraints on how ACEs can be 
   ordered, and which principals must have an ACE. 

      <!ELEMENT acl-semantics acl-sem*> 
        
      <!ELEMENT acl-sem (ace-combination, ace-ordering, required-
      principal)> 

 6.1 ACE Combination 

   The DAV:ace-combination element defines how privileges from multiple 
   ACEs that match the current user will be combined to determine the 
   access privileges for that user.  Multiple ACEs may match the same 
   user because the same principal can appear in multiple ACEs, because 
   multiple principals can identify the same user, and because one 
   principal can be a member of another principal.   

      <!ELEMENT ace-combination 
       (first-match | all-grant-before-any-deny | no-deny)> 

 6.1.1 DAV:first-match ACE Combination 

   The ACEs are evaluated in the order in which they appear in the ACL.  
   If the first ACE that matches the current user does not grant all 
   the privileges needed for the request, the request MUST fail. 

      <!ELEMENT first-match EMPTY> 

 6.1.2 DAV:all-grant-before-any-deny ACE Combination 

   The ACEs are evaluated in the order in which they appear in the ACL.  
   If an evaluated ACE denies a privilege needed for the request, the 
   request MUST fail.  If all ACEs have been evaluated without the user 
   being granted all privileges needed for the request, the request 
   MUST fail.  

      <!ELEMENT all-grant-before-any-deny EMPTY> 

 6.1.3 DAV:no-deny ACE Combination 

   All ACEs in the ACL are evaluated.  An "individual ACE" is one whose 
   principal identifies the current user.  A "group ACE" is one whose 

 Clemm, Hopkins, Sedlar, Whitehead                            [Page 15] 

 INTERNET-DRAFT                 WebDAV ACL             January 21, 2001 

   principal is a collection that contains a principal that identifies 
   the current user.  A privilege is granted if it is granted by an 
   individual ACE and not denied by an individual ACE, or if it is 
   granted by a group ACE and not denied by an individual or group ACE.  
   A request MUST fail if any of its needed privileges are not granted. 

      <!ELEMENT no-deny EMPTY> 

 6.2 ACE Ordering 

   The DAV:ace-ordering element defines a constraint on how the ACEs 
   can be ordered in the ACL.   

      <!ELEMENT ace-ordering (deny-before-grant)? > 

 6.2.1 DAV:deny-before-grant ACE Ordering 

   This element indicates that all deny ACEs must precede all grant 
   ACEs. 

      <!ELEMENT deny-before-grant EMPTY> 

 6.3 Required Principals 

   The required principal elements identify which principals must have 
   an ACE defined in the ACL.   

      <!ELEMENT required-principal 
        (href | all | authenticated | unauthenticated | property | 
      self)> 
       
   For example, the following element requires that the ACE contain a 
   DAV:owner property ACE: 

      <D:required-principal xmlns:D="DAV:"> 
        <D:property> <D:owner/> </D:property> 
      </D:required-principal> 

 7  ACCESS CONTROL AND EXISTING METHODS 

   This section defines the impact of access control functionality on 
   existing methods. 

 7.1 OPTIONS 

   If the server supports access control, it MUST return "access-
   control" as a field in the DAV response header from an OPTIONS 
   request on any resource implemented by that server. 

 7.1.1Example - OPTIONS 

      >> REQUEST <<
       
        OPTIONS /foo.html HTTP/1.1  
        Host: www.webdav.org 
        Content-Length: 0 

 Clemm, Hopkins, Sedlar, Whitehead                            [Page 16] 

 INTERNET-DRAFT                 WebDAV ACL             January 21, 2001 

          
      >> RESPONSE <<
       
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK 
        DAV: 1, 2, access-control 
        Allow: OPTIONS, GET, PUT, PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, ACL 
       
   In this example, the OPTIONS response indicates that the server 
   supports access control and that /foo.html can have its access 
   control list modified by the ACL method. 

 8  ACCESS CONTROL METHODS 

 8.1 ACL 

   A DAV:acl property of a resource is modified by the ACL method.  A 
   new DAV:acl value must be written in its entirety, including any 
   inherited ACEs.  Unless the DAV:acl property of the resource can be 
   updated to be exactly the value specified in the ACL request, the 
   ACL request MUST fail.  If a server restricts the set of ACEs 
   visible to the current user via the DAV:acl property, then the ACL 
   request would only replace the set of ACEs visible to the current 
   user, and would not affect any ACE that was not visible. 

   In order to avoid overwriting DAV:acl changes by another client, a 
   client SHOULD acquire a WebDAV lock on the resource before 
   retrieving the DAV:acl property of a resource that it intends on 
   updating. 

 8.1.1 ACL Preconditions 

   An implementation MAY enforce one or more of the following 
   constraints on an ACL request.  If the constraint is violated, a 403 
   (Forbidden) response MUST be returned and the indicated XML element 
   MUST be returned in the response body. 

   <DAV:protected/>: An implementation MAY protect an ACE from 
   modification or deletion.  For example, some implementations 
   implicitly grant the DAV:owner of a resource DAV:read-acl and 
   DAV:write-acl privileges, and this cannot be changed by a client.   

   <DAV:too-many-aces/>: An implementation MAY limit the number of ACEs 
   in an ACL.  However, ACL-compliant servers MUST support at least one 
   ACE granting privileges to a single principal, and one ACE granting 
   privileges to a collection principal. 

   <DAV:non-inherited-must-precede-inherited/>: All non-inherited ACEs 
   MUST precede all inherited ACEs. 

   <DAV:deny-must-precede-grant/>: All non-inherited deny ACEs MUST 
   precede all non-inherited grant ACEs. 

 8.1.2 Example: the ACL method 

   In the following example, user "fielding", authenticated by 
   information in the Authorization header, grants the principal

   identified by the URL http://www.foo.org/users/esedlar  (i.e., the 
   user "esedlar") read and write privileges, grants the owner of the 
   resource read-acl and write-acl privileges, and grants everyone read 
   privileges inherited from the parent collection 
   http://www.foo.bar/top/.

      >> Response << 
       
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK 

 8.1.3 Example: ACL method failure due to omission of protected ACE 

   In the following request, user "fielding", authenticated by 
   information in the Authorization header, attempts to grant the 
   principal identified by the URL http://www.foo.org/users/esedlar  
   (i.e., the user "esedlar") read privileges, but fails because an 
   protected ACE has been omitted (e.g. the ACE granting the DAV:owner 
   DAV:read-acl and DAV:write-acl privileges must always be present 
   since it is protected -- see Section 5.4.3).

 8.1.4 Example: ACL method failure due to inherited ACEs preceding non-
       inherited ACEs

   on the resource http://www.foo.org/top/index.html. This resource has 
   two inherited ACEs.  

   Inherited ACE #1 grants the principal identified by URL 
   http://www.foo.org/users/ejw (i.e., the user "ejw") 
   http://www.foo.org/privs/write-all and DAV:read-acl privileges. On 
   this server, http://www.foo.org/privs/write-all is an aggregate 
   privilege containing DAV:write, and DAV:write-acl.  

   Inherited ACE #2 grants principal DAV:all the DAV:read privilege. 

   The request attempts to add a third ACE, granting the principal 
   identified by the URL http://www.foo.org/users/gclemm (i.e., the 
   user "gclemm") DAV:write permission, but in the request places the 
   inherited ACEs before the non-inherited ACEs, causing an error on 
   this specific server implementation. Note that on a different 
   implementation, this request might be accepted.

 8.1.5 Example: ACL method failure due to an attempt to set grant and 
       deny in a single ACE. 

   In this example, user "ygoland", authenticated by information in the 
   Authorization header, tries to change the access control list on the 
   resource http://www.foo.org/diamond/engagement-ring.gif. The ACL 
   request includes a single, syntactically and semantically incorrect 
   ACE, which attempts to grant the collection principal identified by 
   the URL http://www.foo.org/users/friends/ DAV:read privilege and 
   deny the principal identified by URL 
   http://www.foo.org/users/ygoland-so (i.e., the user "ygoland-so") 
   DAV:read privilege. However, it is illegal to have multiple

   principal elements, as well as both a grant and deny element in the 
   same ACE, so the request fails due to poor syntax.

   Note that if the request had been divided into two ACEs, one to 
   grant, and one to deny, the request would have been syntactically 
   well formed. 

 9  INTERNATIONALIZATION CONSIDERATIONS 

    In this specification, the only human-readable content can be found 
   in the DAV:authentication-id property, found on principal resources.  
   This property contains the name used to authenticate a principal, 
   typically by a user entering this name into a password entry screen.  
   As a result, the authentication-id must be capable of representing 
   names in multiple character sets.  Since DAV:authentication-id is a 
   WebDAV property, it is represented on-the-wire as XML [REC-XML], and 
   hence can leverage XML's language tagging and character set encoding 
   capabilities. Specifically, XML processors must, at minimum, be able 
   to read XML elements encoded using the UTF-8 [UTF-8] encoding of the 
   ISO 10646 multilingual plane. XML examples in this specification 
   demonstrate use of the charset parameter of the Content-Type header, 
   as defined in [RFC3023], as well as the XML "encoding" attribute, 
   which together provide charset identification information for MIME 
   and XML processors. 


 Clemm, Hopkins, Sedlar, Whitehead                            [Page 21] 

 INTERNET-DRAFT                 WebDAV ACL             January 21, 2001 

   For properties other than DAV:authentication-id, it is expected that 
   implementations will treat the property names and values as tokens, 
   and convert these tokens into human-readable text in the user's 
   language and character set when displayed to a person.  Only a 
   generic WebDAV property display utility would display these values 
   in their raw form. 

   For error reporting, we follow the convention of HTTP/1.1 status 
   codes, including with each status code a short, English description 
   of the code (e.g., 200 (OK)).  While the possibility exists that a 
   poorly crafted user agent would display this message to a user, 
   internationalized applications will ignore this message, and display 
   an appropriate message in the user's language and character set. 

   Further internationalization considerations for this protocol are 
   described in the WebDAV Distributed Authoring protocol specification 
   [RFC2518]. 

 10 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS  

   Applications and users of this access control protocol should be 
   aware of several security considerations, detailed below. In 
   addition to the discussion in this document, the security 
   considerations detailed in the HTTP/1.1 specification [RFC2616], the 
   WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol specification [RFC2518], and 
   the XML Media Types specification [RFC3023] should be considered in 
   a security analysis of this protocol.  

 10.1 Increased Risk of Compromised Users 

   In the absence of a mechanism for remotely manipulating access 
   control specifications, if a single user's authentication 
   credentials are compromised, only those resources for which the user 
   has access permission can be read, modified, moved, or deleted. With 
   the introduction of this access control protocol, if a single 
   compromised user has the ability to change ACLs for a broad range of 
   other users (e.g., a super-user), the number of resources that could 
   be altered by a single compromised user increases. This risk can be 
   mitigated by limiting the number of people who have write-acl 
   privileges across a broad range of resources. 

 10.2 Authentication-id Property and Dictionary Attacks 

   Every principal has a DAV:authentication-id property defined on it, 
   which provides the name used to authenticate this principal, 
   typically the username portion of a username/password authentication 
   scheme. An attacker can use the information in this property when 
   attempting either a brute-force, or a dictionary attack to guess the 
   principal's identifying password. By providing the username in 
   DAV:authentication-id, the scope of an attack can be reduced to a 
   single, valid username. Furthermore, it is possible that principals 
   can potentially belong to a collection. In this case, it is possible 
   to use the PROPFIND method to retrieve the DAV:authentication-id 
   property from all of the principals in a collection, thus providing 
   multiple usernames that can be the focus of attack. 


 Clemm, Hopkins, Sedlar, Whitehead                            [Page 22] 

 INTERNET-DRAFT                 WebDAV ACL             January 21, 2001 

   To reduce this risk, the DAV:authentication-id property should not 
   be world-readable. Which principals are granted default read 
   privilege for DAV:authentication-id should be carefully considered 
   in any deployment of this protocol. 

 10.3 Risks of the read-acl Privilege 

   The ability to read the access privileges (stored in the DAV:acl 
   property), or the privileges permitted the currently authenticated 
   user (stored in the DAV:current-user-privilege-set property) on a 
   resource may seem innocuous, since reading an ACL cannot possibly 
   affect the resource's state. However, if all resources have world-
   readable ACLs, it is possible to perform an exhaustive search for 
   those resources that have inadvertently left themselves in a 
   vulnerable state, such as being world-writeable. In particular, the 
   property retrieval method PROPFIND, executed with Depth infinity on 
   an entire hierarchy, is a very efficient way to retrieve the DAV:acl 
   or DAV:current-user-privilege-set properties. Once found, this 
   vulnerability can be exploited by a denial of service attack in 
   which the open resource is repeatedly overwritten. Alternately, 
   writeable resources can be modified in undesirable ways. 

   To reduce this risk, read-acl privileges should not be granted to 
   unauthenticated principals, and restrictions on read-acl privileges 
   for authenticated principals should be carefully analyzed when 
   deploying this protocol. 

 11 AUTHENTICATION 

   Authentication mechanisms defined in WebDAV also apply to this 
   WebDAV Access Control Protocol, in particular the Basic and Digest 
   authentication mechanisms defined in [RFC2617]. 

 12 IANA CONSIDERATIONS 

   This document uses the namespace defined by [RFC2518] for XML 
   elements.  All other IANA considerations mentioned in [RFC2518] also 
   applicable to WebDAV ACL.
