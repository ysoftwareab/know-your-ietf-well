2.  Introduction

   In order to fax over IP networks different methods can be used. In
   many countries fax are legal documents. What is the best way to
   deliver fax? What is the most reliable method?
   This document proposes a priority of negotiation of transport method
   for fax over IP.
   The goal of this draft is offer the best assurance in fax delivery.
   The discussion is not focus on the efficiency of signaling voice
   protocols over IP networks.
   Traditionally, faxes uses TDM techniques with ensured synchronization
   throughout the network. This strict clocking allowed faxes to use
   complex audio techniques and high rates of throughput. Given the
   burst nature of packet based networks the clocking synchronization is
   not guaranteed so the transmission of facsimile can be problematic.
   There are three techniques for sending faxes over IP consisting of
   fax pass through, real-time fax relay and fax store and forward.


3.  Implementation and Operations

   The fax over IP transmission starts from the end user or the customer
   premises equipment e.g. ATA, POTS or PSTN gateway, fax server, etc.
   These devices MUST negotiate a facsimile method using this priority:

  1) CONSIDERATION and FIRST SELECTION
  
  ----------------------------------------
  | fax isn't an interactive application |
  ----------------------------------------
    |
    |  ----------------------------------------------
    -->| fax isn't a real time critical application |
       ----------------------------------------------
         |
         |  ------------------------------------------------------------
         -->| the first choice is Store and Forward fax on the network |
            ------------------------------------------------------------

   Store and Forward faxing retry continuously until successful and
   offer never busy fax service.
   All Store and Forward fax services MUST be used in the FIRST
   SELECTION. [T.37] protocol and subsequent similar implementations
   MUST be used in the FIRST SELECTION.

                -------------------------------------------- 
                | if Store and Forward is not supported or |
                | not negotiated pass to second selection  |
                --------------------------------------------


  2) SECOND SELECTION

  ----------------------------------
  | fax is a real time application |
  ----------------------------------
    |
    |  --------------------------------------
    -->| the choice is real time fax relay  |
       --------------------------------------
 
   All fax relay services MUST be used in SECOND SELECTION.
   [T.38] protocol, vendor-proprietary fax relay method and subsequent
   similar implementations MUST be used in the SECOND SELECTION.


                 ---------------------------------------- 
                 | if fax relay is not supported or not |
                 |  negotiated pass to third selection  |
                 ----------------------------------------


  3) THIRD SELECTION or LAST CHANCE

  -----------------------------------
  | last choice is fax pass-through |
  -----------------------------------

   Fax pass-through is susceptible to packet loss, jitter, and latency
   in the IP network. So this is the last chance. All fax pass-through
   services like pass-through upspeeding, pass-through with [NSE],
   clear channel transmission, transparent transmission and similar
   implementation MUST be used in the THIRD SELECTION.



4.  Notes of implementation

   Redundancy transmission techniques, error correction mode and
   variation of simple duration are not mentioned because the scope is
   adopt a rigid priority during negotiation of fax over IP method.

   This doesn't mean that all vendors must implement all fax services in
   their devices. I explain this concept with an example. If an ATA or
   Analog Telephone Adapter supports only pass-through method, It will
   choose the THIRD SELECTION or LAST CHANCE. If it supports also T.38,
   It MUST to try that before of other.
