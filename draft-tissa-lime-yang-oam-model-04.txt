1.  Introduction

   [I-D.tissa-lime-yang-oam-model] defines a YANG [RFC6020] data model
   for Layer independent OAM Management implementations that can be
   applied to various network technologies.  This YANG module describes
   the abstract common core configuration, statistics for Unified
   Management Plane OAM to be used within IETF in a layer independent
   manner.This document describes the abstract notification and rpc
   command which is complementary to the one defined in the [I-D.tissa-
   lime-yang-oam-model] . The abstract notification and rpc command
   includes technology independent configuration data and state data.

Internet-Draft           Generic OAM YANG Model               April 2015


   An overview of OAM tools is presented at [RFC7276].

   Ping and Traceroute [RFC792], [RFC4443] are well-known fault
   verification and isolation tools, respectively, for IP networks.
   Over the years, different technologies have developed similar tools
   for similar purposes.

   [IEEE802.1Q] Connectivity Fault Management is a well-established OAM
   standard that is widely adopted for Ethernet networks.  ITU-T
   [Y1731], MEF Service OAM, MPLS-TP [RFC6371], TRILL [TRILLOAMFM] all
   define OAM methods based on manageability frame work of [IEEE802.1Q]
   CFM.

   Given the wide adoption of the underlying OAM concepts defined in
   [IEEE802.1Q] CFM, it is a reasonable choice to develop the unified
   management framework based on those concepts.  In this document, we
   take the [IEEE802.1Q] CFM model and extend it to a technology
   independent framework and build the corresponding YANG model
   accordingly.  The YANG model presented in this document is the base
   model and supports generic continuity check, connectivity
   verification and path discovery.  The generic OAM YANG model is
   designed such that it can be extended to cover various technologies.
   Technology dependent nodes and RPC commands are defined in technology
   specific YANG models, which use and extend the base model defined
   here.  As an example, VXLAN uses source UDP port number for flow
   entropy, while MPLS [RFC4379] uses IP addresses or the label stack
   for flow entropy in the hashing for multipath selection.  To capture
   this variation, corresponding YANG models would define the applicable
   structures as augmentation to the generic base model presented here.
   This accomplishes three purposes: first it keeps each YANG model
   smaller and manageable.  Second, it allows independent development of
   corresponding YANG models.  Third, implementations can limit support
   to only the applicable set of YANG models. (e.g.  TRILL RBridge may
   only need to implement Generic OAM model and the TRILL YANG model).

   All implementations that follow the YANG framework presented in this
   document MUST implement the generic OAM YANG model presented here.

   The YANG data model presented in this document occurs at the
   management layer.  Encapsulations and state machines may differ
   according to each OAM protocol.  A user who wishes to issues a Ping
   command or a Traceroute or initiate a performance monitoring session
   can do so in the same manner regardless of the underlying protocol or
   technology or specific vendor implementation.

   As an example, consider a scenario where an IP ping from device A to
   Device B failed.  Between device A and B there are IEEE 802.1 bridges
   a,b and c.  Let's assume a,b and c are using [IEEE802.1Q] CFM.  A

   user upon detecting the IP layer ping failures may decide to drill
   down to the Ethernet layer and issue the corresponding fault
   verification (LBM) and fault isolation (LTM) tools, using the same
   API.  This ability to go up and down to different layers for
   troubleshooting is referred to as "nested OAM workflow" and is a
   useful concept that leads to efficient network troubleshooting and
   maintenance.  The OAM YANG model presented in this document
   facilitates that without needing changes to the underlying protocols.

3.  Architecture of Generic YANG Model for OAM

   In this document we define a generic YANG model for OAM.  The YANG
   model defined here is generic such that other technologies can extend
   it for technology specific needs.  The Generic OAM YANG model acts as
   the root for other OAM YANG models.  This allows users to traverse
   between OAM of different technologies at ease through a uniform API
   set.  This is also provides a nested OAM workflow.  Figure 1 depicts
   the relationship of different OAM YANG models to the Generic OAM YANG
   Model.  Some technologies may have different sub-technologies.  As an
   example, consider Network Virtualization Overlays.  These could
   employ either vXLAN or NVGRE as encapsulation.  The Generic OAM YANG
   model provides a framework where technology-specific YANG models can
   inherit constructs from the base YANG models without needing to
   redefine them within the sub-technology.

   Figure 1 depicts relationship of different YANG modules.

        Relationship of OAM YANG model to generic (base) YANG model

4.  Overview of the OAM Model

   In this document we adopt the concepts of the [IEEE802.1Q] CFM model
   and structure it such that it can be adapted to different
   technologies.

   At the top of the Model is the Maintenance Domain.  Each Maintenance
   Domain is associated with a Maintenance Name and a Domain Level.

   Under each Maintenance Domain there is one or more Maintenance
   Association (MA).  In IP, the MA can be per IP Subnet, in NVO3 this
   can be per VNI and for TRILL this can be per Fine-Grained Label or
   for VPLS this can be per VPLS instance.

   Under each MA, there can be two or more MEPs (Maintenance End
   Points).  MEPs are addressed by their respective technology specific
   address identifiers.  The YANG model presented here provides
   flexibility to accommodate different addressing schemes.

   In a parallel vertical, presented are the commands.  Those, in YANG
   terms, are the rpc commands.  These rpc commands provide uniform APIs

   for continuity check,connectivity verification, path discovery and
   their equivalents as well as other OAM commands.

   [IEEE802.1Q] CFM framework requires explicit configuration of OAM
   entities prior to using any of the OAM tools.  Users of Ping and
   Traceroute tools within IP devices are expecting ability to use OAM
   tools with no explicit configuration.  In order to facilitate zero-
   touch experience, this document defines a default mode of OAM.  The
   default mode of OAM is referred to as the Base Mode and specifies
   default values for each of the [IEEE802.1Q] CFM parameters, such as
   Maintenance Domain Level, Name of the Maintenance Association and
   Addresses of MEP and so on.  The default values of these depend on
   the technology.  Base Mode for TRILL is defined in [RFC7455].  Base
   mode for other technologies such as NVO3, MPLS and future extensions
   will be defined in their corresponding documents.

   It is important to note that, no specific enhancements are needed in
   the YANG model to support Base Mode.  Implementations that comply
   with this document, by default implement the data nodes of the
   applicable technology.  Data nodes of the Base Mode are read-only
   nodes.

4.1.  Maintenance Domain (MD) configuration

   The container "domains" is the top level container within the gen-oam
   module.  Within the container "domains", separate list is maintained
   per MD.  The MD list uses the key MD-name-string for indexing.  MD-
   name-string is a leaf and derived from type string.  Additional name
   formats as defined in [IEEE802.1Q] or other standards can be included
   by association of the MD-name-format with an identity-ref.  MD-name-
   format indicates the format of the augmented MD-names.  MD-name is
   presented as choice/case construct.  Thus, it is easily augmentable
   by derivative work.

4.4.  rpc definitions

   The rpc model facilitates issuing commands to a NETCONF server (in
   this case to the device that need to execute the OAM command) and
   obtain a response. rpc model defined here abstracts OAM specific
   commands in a technology independent manner.

   There are several rpc commands defined for the purpose of OAM.  In
   this section we present a snippet of the ping command for
   illustration purposes.  Please refer to Section 4 for the complete

4.5.  OAM data hierarchy

   The complete data hierarchy related to the OAM YANG model is
   presented below.  The following notations are used within the data
   tree and carry the meaning as below.

   Each node is printed as:

   <status> <flags> <name> <opts> <type>

   <status> is one of:
        +  for current
        x  for deprecated
        o  for obsolete


   <flags> is one of:

       rw for configuration data
       ro for non-configuration data
       -x for rpcs
       -n for notifications


   <name> is the name of the node

   If the node is augmented into the tree from another module, its name
   is printed as <prefix>:<name>.

   <opts> is one of:

        ?  for an optional leaf or choice
        !  for a presence container
        *  for a leaf-list or list
        [<keys>] for a list's keys

   <type> is the name of the type for leafs and leaf-lists

   <CODE ENDS>

6.  Base Mode

   The Base Mode defines default configuration that MUST be present in
   the devices that comply with this document.  Base Mode allows users
   to have "zero-touch" experience.  Several parameters require
   technology specific definition.

6.1.  MEP Address

   In the Base Mode of operation, the MEP Address is by default the IP
   address of the interface on which the MEP is located.

6.2.  MEP ID for Base Mode

   In the Base Mode of operation, each device creates a single UP MEP
   associated with a virtual OAM port with no physical layer (NULL PHY).
   The MEPID associated with this MEP is zero (0).  The choice of MEP-ID
   zero is explained below.

   MEPID is 2 octet field by default.  It is never used on the wire
   except when using CCM.  Ping, traceroute and session monitoring does
   not use the MEPID on its message header.  It is important to have
   method that can derive MEP ID of base mode in an automatic manner
   with no user intervention.  IP address cannot be directly used for
   this purpose as the MEP ID is much smaller field.  For Base Mode of
   operation we propose to use MEP ID zero (0) as the default MEP-ID.

   CCM packet use MEP-ID on the payload.  CCM MUST NOT be used in the
   Base Mode.  Hence CCM MUST be disabled on the Maintenance Association
   of the Base Mode.

   If CCM is required, users MUST configure a separate Maintenance
   association and assign unique value for the corresponding MEP IDs.

   [IEEE802.1Q] CFM defines MEP ID as an unsigned integer in the range 1
   to 8191.  In this document we propose to extend the range to 0 to
   65535.  Value 0 is reserved for MEP ID of Base Mode operation and
   MUST NOT be used for other purposes.

6.3.  Maintenance Domain

   Default MD-LEVEL is set to 3.

6.4.  Maintenance Association

   MAID [IEEE802.1Q] has a flexible format and includes two parts:
   Maintenance Domain Name and Short MA name.  In the Based Mode of
   operation, the value of the Maintenance Domain Name must be the
   character string "GenericBaseMode" (excluding the quotes ").  In Base
   Mode operation Short MA Name format is set to 2-octet integer format
   (value 3 in Short MA Format field [IEEE802.1Q]) and Short MA name set
   to 65532 (0xFFFC).

7.  Note

   This section will be removed or subject to change in the future if
   any agreement is reached.  As per investigation of RFC7276 for
   performance Monitoring for Loss and Delay are defined for MPLS
   OAM(RFC6374), OWAMP (RFC4676) and TWAMP (RFC5357) and TRILL OAM
   (RFC7456).  In case of Performance Monitoring Statistics are common
   between these technologies thus generic Yang model for Performance
   will be worked out through separate draft with Augmentation of
   Generic LIME model.  In case of Other Function, it's technology
   specific and thus should be dealt in technology specific Yang model
   instead of Generic Model.

8.  Security Considerations

   TBD.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the following namespace URI in the IETF XML
   registry.

Appendix A.  Acknowledgments

   Giles Heron came up with the idea of developing a YANG model as a way
   of creating a unified OAM API set (interface), work in this document
   is largely an inspiration of that.  Alexander Clemm provided many
   valuable tips, comments and remarks that helped to refine the YANG
   model presented in this document.

   Carlos Pignataro, David Ball and others participated and contributed
   to this document.
