Abstract

   This document describes conference policy data elements and the
   mechanisms to manipulate them at a server via Conference Policy
   Control Protocol (CPCP). Extensible Markup Language (XML)
   Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP) is used to implement CPCP. This
   document specifies an XML Schema and XCAP application usage that are
   needed to implement CPCP.

Internet-Draft                 XCAP CPCP                       June 2003


1. Introduction

   SIP conferencing framework [10] defines the mechanisms for
   multi-party centralized conferencing in SIP environment. Existing SIP
   mechanisms allow users e.g. to join and leave a conference.
   Centralized server (called focus) can expel and invite users, and
   have proprietary access control lists and privilege definitions.
   However, in many cases it is useful to have standardized conference
   policy elements (such as access control lists) and the standardized
   protocol means to manipulate them as defined in conference policy
   control protocol requirements [7] (CPCP) document. This document
   provides both standardized conference policy elements and XCAP usage
   to manipulate them.

   Other mechanisms, such as web page or voice response system can also
   be used to manipulate conference policy data. However, these
   solutions are not appropriate due to lack of interoperability. This
   document provides an XCAP [8] application usage to solve these
   issues.

   XCAP is a HTTP 1.1 based protocol that allows clients to read, write,
   modify and delete application elements at a server. One application
   area which has already adopted XCAP is the manipulation of presence
   lists [9].

   XCAP has many advantages to be used for conference policy control
   protocol. First, it is very simple which is important e.g. in
   wireless environments. It is already in use for presence list
   manipulation and it is expected that clients supports both
   applications. Now they can use same protocol for these purposes.

3. Terminology

      ACL

         Access control list (ACL) defines users who can join to a
         conference. Users may have allow, blocked or pending status in
         the list. Each conference has its own ACL.

      CPS

         Conference Policy Server. See [10]

      Conference participant

         Conference participant is a user who has on-going session (e.g.
         SIP dialog) with the conference focus.

      Floor control

         Floor control is a mechanism that enables applications or users
         to gain safe and mutually exclusive or non-exclusive access to
         the shared object or resource in a conference.

      Dial-Out List (DL)

         Dial-out list (DL) is a list of users who the focus needs to
         invite to the conference.

      PCL

         Privilege control control (PCL) defines privileges for a user.
         Each user in a conference may have different list of privileges
         and each conference has its own PCL.

4. Application Unique ID

   XCAP requires application usages to define a unique application usage
   ID (AUID) in either the IETF tree or a vendor tree. This
   specification defines the "conference-policy" AUID within the IETF
   tree, via the IANA registration in Section 17.

5. Computed Data

   Conference server must fill the conference URI and return it in the
   response when the conference is created, if the conference URI was
   not proposed by the client.

6. Overview of Operation

   This document assumes that the user knows the location (URI) of
   conference policy server, the details of that discovery are beyond
   the scope of this document.

   CPCP is implemented as an XCAP application usage, similarly to
   presence list manipulation which is also using XCAP.

   CPCP allows clients to manipulate the conference policy at conference
   policy server (CPS). CPS is able to inform the focus, if necessary.
   For example, if new users are added to the dial-out list, then
   conference policy server informs the focus which makes the invites as
   requested.

   Some assumptions about the conferencing architecture are made.
   Clients always connect to the conference policy server (CPS) when
   they perform XCAP operations. It is assumed that CPS informs other
   conferencing entities, such as focus, floor control server and mixer
   directly or via focus. For example, when user expels another user via
   XCAP based CPCP, then it must first manipulate policy data in CPS
   which then asks the focus to perform the operation. The communication
   between different (logical) conferencing elements are beyond the
   scope of this document. It can be expected that in most cases CPS
   performs also those logical functions.

   OPEN ISSUE: Does focus ever need to update conference policy? (maybe
   in some cases)

   Conference factory applications may also use CPCP to create the
   conference, receive the conference URI, then redirect the conference
   creator to the conference URI.

   Ad-hoc conferences may also became CPCP-controlled. In this case, the
   creator of the original ad-hoc conference (the one who sent initial
   INVITE) has all privileges.

   OPEN ISSUE: Is this needed? (ad-hoc conf becames CPCP-controlled)

7. Conference Creation and Termination

   Conference is identied by a conference URI which is hosted by the
   server (CPS).

   A user may create a new conference at the CPS by using HTTP POST.
   Depending on server policy and user privileges, CPS may accept the
   creation.

   Conference (and its resources) can be deleted permanently using HTTP
   DELETE. When the user deletes a conference, CPS MUST also delete all
   its subconferences ("sidebars") at a server.

   Conference sidebars are separate (independent) URIs at the server.

Internet-Draft                 XCAP CPCP                       June 2003


8. User Additions and Expels

   User with sufficient privileges (users with
   RIGHT_TO_DO_USER_MANAGEMENT privilege) is allowed to perform user
   management operations, such as adding (deleting) user to (from) the
   conference. These commands are sent to the conference policy server.
   After ensuring that the manipulation command came from the privileged
   user, conference policy server asks the focus to perform the
   indicated operation (SIP INVITE or SIP BYE).

   Invite operation is achieved with HTTP POST. This modifies Dial-Out
   List and CPS triggers the focus to send the SIP INVITE(s) as needed.
   Expel operation uses POST as well, as user is put to ACL list with
   Blocked action. Similarly to Invite, this trigger CPS to inform the
   focus about the need to issue a SIP BYE.

9. Naming Conventions

   There are no naming conventions that need to be defined for this
   application usage.

10. Structure of a Conference Policy document

   Conference policy document is an XML [5] document that MUST be
   well-formed and SHOULD be valid. Conference policy documents MUST be
   based on XML 1.0 and MUST be encoded using UTF-8. This specification
   makes use of XML namespaces for identifying conference policy
   documents and document fragments. The namespace URI for elements
   defined by this specification is a URN [2], using the namespace
   identifier 'ietf' defined by [3] and extended by [11]. This URN is:

   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conference-policy

   A conference policy document begins with the root element tag
   ``conference-policy''.  It consists of one mandatory element
   "conference." Other elements from different namespaces MAY be present
   for the purposes of extensibility; elements or attributes from
   unknown namespaces MUST be ignored. Conference element includes
   following sub-elements:


      Conference-info: This mandatory sub-element includes informational attributes
   	describing the conference, e.g. for search purposes and to be included
           into dial-out session descriptions.
      Conference-time: This mandatory sub-element includes information related
        to conference duration.
      ACL: This is mandatory sub-element for access control list.
      PCL: This is mandatory sub-element for privilege control list.
      DL: This is mandatory sub-element for dial-out list.
      SC: This is mandatory sub-element for security control.
      Conference-media-policy: This is mandatory sub-element for conference media policy.

   The attributes are described in more detail in forthcoming sections.

11. Structure of XML Document

11.1 <Conference-URI> element

   Conference is identified by the conference URI, which is allocated by
   the conference policy server and returned to the client. It is also
   possible that client proposes a new name by itself (e.g.
   sip:discussion-on-dogs@example.com) as it may be useful to have
   human-friendly name in some cases. Server still decides whether it
   gives the name proposed by the client. Conference URI can be SIP,
   SIPS, or TEL URI. Conference policy server creates the focus for the
   conference when the conference instance starts.

   <Conference-URI> is a mandatory element and it cannot be changed
   during the conference lifetime.

   Conference may be deleted so that conference URI and policy are
   deleted permanently (using HTTP DELETE). Conference instance may also
   be terminated temporarily, e.g. so that conference URI and policy
   remain at the server but conference is no longer active (modifying
   conference end-time).

11.2 <Conference-info> element

   <Conference-Info> element includes informative conference paramaters
   which may be helpful describing the purpose of conference, e.g. for
   search purposes or providing contact information for the host.

   Each conference has an optional <Subject> element, which describes
   the current topic in a conference. The optional <Display-Name>
   element is the display name of the conference, which usually does not
   change over time.

   <Free-Text> and <Keywords> are optional elements. They provide
   additional textual information about the conference. This information
   can be made available to the conference participants or to everyone
   interested by means not specified here. Examples of usage could be
   searching for a conference based on some keywords, providing
   additional information to tentative conference participants etc.

   Optional <Host-Info> element contains several sub-elements. It gives
   additional information about the user who is hosting the conference.
   This information can be be included into SDP fields in SIP INVITEs
   sent by the focus. <SIP-uri> element is mandatory, while <TEL-uri>,
   <Web-page> and <E-mail> are optional. Note that the conference host
   is not necessarily the same as the conference moderator.

Internet-Draft                 XCAP CPCP                       June 2003


11.3 <Conference-time> element

   OPEN ISSUE: Do we need times, maybe just relative time and whether it
   can be extended or not. If there is separate scheduling application
   for future conference reservations, how it is controlled?

   The information related to conference time and lifetime is contained
   in the <Conference-Time> element. The conference may occur only once
   for a limited period of time (i.e. it has a limited lifetime), the
   conference may be non-bounded (i.e. it does not have a specified end
   time), or the conference may be permanent. Bounded conferences may be
   repeated after some time interval (e.g. on weekly basis).

   <Conference-Time> contains one or more <Conference-Occurrences each
   defining the time information of a single conference occurrence.
   Multiple <Conference-Occurrence> elements MAY be used if a conference
   is active at multiple irregularly spaced times; each additional
   <Conference-Occurrence> element contains time information for a
   specific occurrence.

   For each occurrence, the <Start-time> and <Stop-time> specify start
   and stop times for when a conference is active. For example, for a
   conference that is to be repeated once on a different time, one
   <Conference-Occurrence> could define the conference to be active at
   10am on Monday until 11am on Monday, while the second
   <Conference-Occurence> defines the conference to active at 11am on
   Tuesday until 1pm on Tuesday.

   If the conference is active at regular times, a <Repeat> element
   should be used in addition to and following <Start-time> and
   <Stop-time> elements - in which case the <Start-time> and <Stop-time>
   elements specify the start and stop times of the repeat sequence.

   If the <Stop-time> is set to zero, then the session is not bounded,
   though it will not become active until after the <Start-time>.  If
   the <Start-time> is also zero, the session is regarded as permanent.

   <Repeat-interval> element specifies repeat times for a conference.
   For example, if a conference is active at 10am on Monday and 11am on
   Tuesday for one hour each week for three months, then the
   <Start-time> would be 10am on the first Monday, the <Repeat-interval>
   would be 1 week, the <Active-duration> would be 1 hour, and the
   offsets <Offsets-from-start-time> would be zero and 25 hours. The
   corresponding <Stop-time> would be the end of the last session three
   months later. In this example, the information is contained within a
   single <Conference-Occurrence element>.

   By default all repeat attributes are in seconds.

11.4 <PCL> (Privilege Control List) element

   Many kind of operations can be performed in a conference so there
   must be a mechanism that controls who are allowed to perform which
   operation. In the simplest case, one user - often called as a
   moderator - has the right to perform any operation available. In
   other cases, it may be useful to define e.g. that some users are
   allowed to expel users but not perform any other operations.
   Therefore, conferencing framework supports the idea of privileges.
   Privilege is a temporary user right to perform an operation.
   Conference may have at least the following privileges:




   	RIGHT_TO_CREATE_CONFERENCE
   	RIGHT_TO_TERMINATE_CONFERENCE
   	RIGHT_TO_MANIPULATE_GENERAL_PARAMETERS
   	RIGHT_TO_DO_USER_MANAGEMENT
   	RIGHT_TO_MANIPULATE_MEDIA_POLICY
   	RIGHT_TO_CONNECT_DISCONNECT_STREAMS
   	RIGHT_TO_MANIPULATE_SIDEBAR
   	RIGHT_TO_MANIPULATE_OWN_MEDIA_POLICY
   	RIGHT_TO_MANIPULATE_PRIVILEGES
   	RIGHT_TO_MANIPULATE_FLOOR_POLICY

   Explanations:

   RIGHT_TO_CREATE_CONFERENCE: Users with this privilege can create a
   new conference at a server.

   RIGHT_TO_TERMINATE_CONFERENCE: Users who have this privilege may
   terminate (delete) current conference by using CPCP.

   RIGHT_TO_MANIPULATE_GENERAL_PARAMETERS: Users who have this privilege
   can manipulate general parameters, e.g. conference time, Subject etc.

   RIGHT_TO_DO_USER_MANAGEMENT: Users who have this privilege are
   allowed to ask the focus to invite and expel users.

   RIGHT_TO_MANIPULATE_MEDIA_POLICY: Users who have this privilege may
   manipulate the media part of conference policy by using CPCP.

   RIGHT_TO_MANIPULATE_OWN_MEDIA_POLICY: User who have this privilege is
   allowed to manipulate his or her own media policy.

   RIGHT_TO_MANIPULATE_PRIVILEGES: Users who have this privilege may
   give (or take away) a privilege to another user by using CPCP. After

   succesful completion of this command, conference policy has the new
   information. It is up to the conference focus to send a notification
   and inform the user who got the new privilege.

   RIGHT_TO_MANIPULATE_FLOOR_POLICY: Users who have this privilege are
   allowed to create floors and assign floor moderators (using floor
   control protocol) for all media sessions within the conference.

   Initial privileges are defined when the conference is originally
   created. Privileges may be handed over to other users and they can be
   taken away. Also users outside of conference may hold a privilege.
   Problematic situations might be possible, such as nobody in a
   conference has any privileges. These kind of situations are
   impossible to completely avoid. However, as a backup mechanism, the
   conference creator or at least one user has always the
   RIGHT_TO_GIVE_PRIVILEGE privilege. Moreover, conference service (or
   server) may have server-specific backup rules, e.g. server
   administrator may be manually involved, if necessary.

   It is necessary to control the information which users have
   privileges. Therefore, ACL-like Privilege Control List (PCL) is
   introduced as a policy data element. It includes target URI (possibly
   wildcarded) followed by the list of privileges.

   Example PCL looks like this:

   sip:bob@example.com: RIGHT_TO_EXPEL, RIGHT_TO_MANIPULATE_FLOOR_POLICY
   sip:*@example.com: RIGHT_TO_EXPEL
   sip:alice@company.com: RIGHT_TO_TERMINATE_CONFERENCE

   User can fetch the PCL from the conference policy server by using
   HTTP GET as it is part of conference policy.

   New privileges can be added to a user by using a HTTP POST operation
   for a given subtree and privilege can be taken away using HTTP
   DELETE. These commands can be succesfully performed only by those
   users who themselves have the required privilege
   (RIGHT_TO_MANIPULATE_PRIVILEGES).

11.5 <SC> (Security Control) element

   The conference security encompasses three aspects: controlling the
   visibility of a conference, securing the SIP messages, and performing
   authentication for individual users.

   The mandatory <Visibility> element controls whether the conference is
   visible to others than users participating in a conference. This
   element may have two values: "Visible" and "Invisible". If

   <Visibility> is set to "Invisible" then the conference policy server
   should not reveal any information about the conference to others than
   partipants.

   We define two mechanisms for securing the signalling dialogs between
   users and the conference policy server: TLS and S/MIME.

   TLS is used to provide transport layer security on a hop-by-hop
   basis. According to SIP [6], using SIPS URI scheme in a request
   signifies that TLS must be used to secure each hop over which the
   request is forwarded until the request reaches the SIP entity
   responsible for the domain portion of the Request-URI.

   When the mandatory <Security-Mechanism> in the conference policy has
   a value "TLS=true" (thus implying the use of SIPS URI scheme), it is
   required that TLS is used end-to-end. In other words, TLS must be
   used also on the last hop between the entity responsible for the
   domain portion of the Request-URI and the conference policy server.

   If end-to-end confidentiality of entire SIP messages is not required
   in the conference policy, but it is required that the message bodies
   within SIP are encrypted, the <Security-Policy> element must have a
   value "S/MIME=true".

   TLS and S/MIME may be required independent of each other. In other
   words, it may be requred to use neither, one, or both depending on
   the settings of these parameters.

   The conference creator may optionally define the authentication
   policy for individual participants. Mechanisms used for this are
   defined in the <Authorization-mechanism> element. The only defined
   authorization mechanism in this document is HTTP Digest.

   The value of the <Authorization-mechanism> element may be either
   "Digest" indicating HTTP Digest authentication, or "none" indicating
   that no authentication is required. The password associated with each
   user in the Digest authentication is included in the optional
   <Password> attribute. This attribute is ignored if authentication is
   set to "none".

   Each target URI in the SC list is also associated with a <Visibility>
   element that defines whether the participant is visible to other
   users. The relationship of this attribute and the the <Visibility>
   element affecting the whole conference is as follows:


   - Conference visible, participant visible: participant is visible to everyone
   - Conference visible, participant invisible: participant is invisible to everyone

   - Conference invisible, participant visible: participant is visible to the conference
     participants
   - Conference invisible, participant invisible: participant is invisible to everyone


11.6 <DL> (Dial-Out List) element

   The purpose of a dial-out list (DL) in a conference is to trigger the
   focus to invite users in (e.g. due to charging reasons). This list
   can be updated during the conference lifetime so it can be used for
   mid-conference invites (and mass-invites) as well.

   DL includes list of users (wildcards not allowed) and list of
   parameters for each user. Focus does not update the DL, so the
   existing DL users remain in the DL until they are removed (using
   DELETE).

   DL includes two parameters for each user in the list: the repeat time
   (how many times user is called), and the interval between the call
   attempts. Repeat time zero (0) means that call attempts are tried
   indefinitely.

   OPEN ISSUE: Are repeat/interval parameters needed? (or just let the
   server to decide?)


   Example DCL looks like:
   sip:bob@example.com: 30, 5-minutes
   tel:tim@example2.com: 3, 1-minutes

   Two operations can be performed for DL: Add new entry (URI) using
   HTTP POST, and Delete current entry using HTTP DELETE. The latter
   means that the user is removed from the DL and not called anymore.

11.7 <ACL> (Access Control List) element

   The purpose of Access Control List (ACL) is to control who can join
   the conference. Conference has one ACL consisting the target and the
   action for the target. The target is user URI (or wildcarded user
   URI). Action is one of Allowed/Blocked/Pending. Allowed means that
   the target is allowed to join the conference. Blocked means the
   opposite and pending means that the target is put on hold while
   further processing - such as consulting the moderator - takes places.

   Example ACL would look like this:
   		sip:bob@example.com: allowed
   		sip:*@example.com: blocked
   		sip:*@company.com: pending

Internet-Draft                 XCAP CPCP                       June 2003


   ACL must have default rule for those targets that no matching rule is
   found (i.e. "pending" action for those targets not found in the
   list).

   Wildcards can be used for whole user part only, not parts of it. For
   example, "sip:*@example.com" is a valid target while
   "sip:b*@example.com" is not.

   Sip: and sips: schemes are treated equally for the same person as ACL
   identifies users, not transport methods or authentication
   requirements.

   "Most specific expression wins" policy is used if overlapping rules
   are found. Basically, this means that user specific rule is searched
   first and if it is not found, then most specific wildcard rule is
   utilized.

   OPEN ISSUE: What kind of wildcard policy for domain part? Must be
   limited somehow in order to prevent too complicated and overlapping
   rules. Proposal: Don't allow it at all, or allow it only immediately
   after "@"-sign. For example, "sip:bob@*.com" is a valid target while
   "sip:bob@example.*" is not. A: Don't Allow wildcards in domain part.

   Following operations exist for ACL:

   		Allow(list of targets)
   		Block(list of targets)
   		Pending(list of targets)
   		Delete(target)

   First three commands create a new (or change existing) rule for the
   list of targets (user URIs or wildcarded user URIs). They can also
   remove unnecessary rules, e.g. if bob@example.com and tom@example.com
   are already blocked when new rule defining that *@example.com is
   blocked is performed, user specific rules can be safely removed.

   HTTP POST is used for Allow/Block/Pending operations and HTTP DELETE
   is used for the last operation. HTTP PUT is used to modify ACL for
   the target who already exists in ACL.

   Delete copes with (potential) ACL size problem. If the conference is
   long-lasting it is possible that new rules are added all the time but
   old rules are almost never removed (some of them are rewritten,
   though). This leads easily to the situation in which the ACL includes
   huge amount of unnecessary rules which are not really needed anymore.
   Therefore, there should be a mechanism to delete ACL. Conference
   focus may send a notification which warns that the size of ACL has
   increased local limit.

   New rule always overrides the old rule. It is server's responsibility
   to ensure this. This guarantees that conflicting rules do not exist
   (e.g. both allowed and blocked action is defined for same target) and
   the order in which ACL is searched is irrelevant.

   Blocking user also expels user from the current conference.

11.8 <Floor-control> element

   Floor control in a conference is performed using Floor Control
   Protocol (FCP). CPCP only controls via privileges who are allowed to
   manipulate floor policy (e.g. create and delete floors). FCP can then
   be used to create floor, and assign and de-assign floor moderator for
   a given floor. For example, in a typical conference the conference
   creator (moderator) first creates a floor for audio plane (using FCP)
   and then names one user - possibly himself -  (using FCP) to act as a
   floor moderator governing the access to the floor. Note that FCP does
   not create media streams (just the virtual floor attached to media),
   as media streams are created using CPCP.

   When the floor has been created and floor moderator has been
   assigned, the floor moderator gets notifications from the focus and
   is able to accept or deny floor requests (using FCP) from the
   conference users. The details of FCP are beyond the scope of this
   draft.

   User with privilege RIGHT_TO_MANIPULATE_FLOOR_POLICY can create the
   floors and assign floor moderator using FCP.

11.9 <Media-Policy> element

   Media policy is integral part of the conference policy. It defines
   e.g. what kind of media topologies exist in the conference. The
   details of media manipulation are defined elsewhere
   (draft-mahy-sipping-media-policy-control-00.txt). User with
   sufficient privileges (RIGHT_TO_MANIPULATE_MEDIA_POLICY) is allowed
   to create, modify and delete media policy (e.g. add new media
   sessions).

13. Authorization Policies

   If the conference is "visible" (as defined in conference policy) then
   anybody can read the policy using HTTP GET. The policy may also be
   available for search engines etc. If the conference is "invisible",
   then only current participants and users with special privilege (e.g.
   RIGHT_TO_DO_USER_MANAGEMENT) can read the policy.

   OPEN ISSUE: Do we need new privilege which defines whether user is
   allowed to read conference policy? (probably no, current privileges
   are ok)

   OPEN ISSUE: Do we need to define that e.g. ACL is not shown in
   visible conferences

   OPEN ISSUE: Who can subscribe to the event package? (if visible, then
   anybody; if invisible, then only current participants and users with
   special privilege?)

   User with sufficient privileges can modify the relevant parts of the
   document. For example, user with privilege
   RIGHT_TO_MANIPULATE_FLOOR_POLICY can modify floor policy part of the
   conference policy.

   At exactly 2003-06-16T10:00:00Z, the conference server creates a focus and sends
   SIP INVITE requests to Alice and Sarah. After the focus is created, SIP INVITE
   requests can be accepted from anyone at domain example.com. Any attempts to join
   the conference by users in other domains are rejected.

   Example 2. Expelling a User

   Continuing with the above example: aftar the conference has started, Alice decides

   to expel Bob who has joined the conference. So she adds him to the ACL list with
   Access-type of value "Blocked".

   OPEN ISSUE: Should there be a attribute defining how long someone should be
   expelled for?

   The XCAP request looks like:

      POST http://xcap.example.com/services/conferences/users/Alice/conference.xml?
         Conference/ACL/ACL-target-URI HTTP/1.1
         Content-Type:text/plain

      <ACL-target-URI Access-type="Blocked">sip:bob@example.com</ACL-target-URI>

   At this point, the focus sends a SIP BYE request to Bob ending Bob's participation
   in the conference. This also guarantees that Bob cannot rejoin the conference since
   he is expilictly blocked until his URI is removed from the ACL blocked list.
   Any attempt Bob makes in rejoining the conference will fail.


   Example 3. Allowing An Expelled Participant To Join Again

   Continuing with the example above, Alice now decides to allow Bob to join again
   after a period of time. She does so by removing his entry in the ACL that identifies
   him as "Blocked

      DELETE http://xcap.example.com/services/conferences/users/Alice/conference.xml?
         Conference/ACL/ACL-target-URI/ACL-target-URI="sip:bob@example.com" HTTP/1.1

   Bob can now rejoin the conference by sending a SIP INVITE request.


   Example 4. Removing A Conference

   Alice now decides she no longer wants this conference to exist and therefore
   deletes the conference:

      DELETE http://xcap.example.com/services/conferences/users/Alice/conference.xml

   As a result of this action, the focus sends SIP BYE requests to all current
   participants in the conference. The conference server terminates the focus
   thereafter.
