Abstract

   The charter of the Point-to-Point Protocol Extensions (pppext)
   working group includes the responsibility to "actively advance PPP's
   most useful extensions to full standard, while defending against
   further enhancements of questionable value." In support of that
   charter, the allocation of PPP protocol and other assigned numbers
   will no longer be "first come first served."






Introduction

   The Point-to-Point protocol (PPP, RFC 1661 [1]) is a mature protocol
   with a large number of subprotocols, encapsulations and other
   extensions.  The main protocol as well as its extensions involve many
   name spaces in which values must be assigned.
   Http://www.iana.org/assignments/ppp-numbers contains a list of the
   address spaces and their current assignments.

   Historically, initial values in new name spaces have often been
   chosen in the RFCs creating the name spaces.  The IANA made
   subsequent assignments with a "First Come First Served" policy.  This
   memo changes that policy for some PPP address spaces.

   Most of the PPP names spaces are quiescent, but some continue to
   attract proposed extensions.  Extensions of PPP have been defined in
   RFCs that are "Informational" and so are not subject to review.
   These extensions usually require values assigned in one or more of
   the PPP name spaces.  Making these allocations require "IETF
   Consensus" will ensure that proposals are reviewed.

Terminology

   The terms "name space", "assigned value", and "registration" are used
   here with the meanings defined in BCP 26 [2].  The policies "First
   Come First Served" and "IETF Consensus" used here also have the
   meanings defined in BCP 26.


IANA Considerations for PPP

   IETF Consensus, usually through the Point-to-Point Protocol
   Extensions (pppext) working group, is required for assigning new
   values in the following address spaces:

                DLL PROTOCOL NUMBERS
                LCP AND IPCP CODES
                LCP CONFIGURATION OPTION TYPES
                CCP CONFIGURATION OPTION TYPES
                AUTHENTICATION ALGORITHMS
                LCP FCS-ALTERNATIVES
                MULTILINK ENDPOINT DISCRIMINATOR CLASS
                LCP CALLBACK OPERATION FIELDS
                BRIDGING CONFIGURATION OPTION TYPES
                BRIDGING MAC TYPES
                BRIDGING SPANNING TREE
                IPCP CONFIGURATION OPTION TYPES
                IPV6CP CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
                IP-Compression-Protocol Types


4. Security Considerations

      This memo deals with matters of process, not protocol.
