                     TRILL Distributed Layer 3 Gateway
                        draft-ietf-trill-irb-07.txt

Abstract

   The base TRILL protocol provides optimal pair-wise data frame
   forwarding for layer 2 intra-subnet traffic but not for layer 3
   inter-subnet traffic. A centralized gateway solution is typically
   used for layer 3 inter-subnet traffic forwarding but has the
   following issues:

         1. Sub-optimum forwarding paths for inter-subnet traffic.

         2. A centralized gateway may need to support a very large
   number of gateway interfaces in a data center, one per tenant per
   data label used by that tenant, to provide interconnect
   functionality for all the layer 2 virtual networks in a TRILL campus.

         3. A traffic bottleneck at the gateway.

   This document specifies an optional TRILL distributed gateway
   solution that resolves these centralized gateway issues.

1. Introduction

   The TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol
   [RFC6325] provides a solution for least cost transparent routing in
   multi-hop networks with arbitrary topologies and link technologies,
   using [IS-IS] [RFC7176] link-state routing and a hop count. TRILL
   switches are sometimes called RBridges (Routing Bridges).

   The base TRILL protocol provides optimal unicast forwarding for
   Layer 2 intra-subnet traffic but not for Layer 3 inter-subnet
   traffic, where subnet means different IP address prefix and
   typically a different Data Label (VLAN or FGL). In this document, a
   TRILL-based distributed Layer 3 gateway solution is specified that
   provides optimal unicast forwarding for Layer 3 inter-subnet traffic.
   With distributed gateway support, an edge RBridge provides both
   routing based on Layer 2 identity (address and virtual network (VN,
   i.e. Data Label)) among end stations (ESs) that belong to same
   subnet and also provides routing based on Layer 3 identity among ESs
   that belong to different subnets of the same routing domain. An edge
   RBridge supporting this feature needs to provide routing instances
   and Layer 3 gateway interfaces for locally connected ESs. Such
   routing instances provide IP address isolation between tenants. In
   the TRILL distributed Layer 3 gateway solution, inter-subnet traffic
   can be fully spread over edge RBridges, so there is no single
   bottleneck.

1.1. Document Organization

   This document is organized as follows: Section 3 gives a simplified
   example and also a more detailed problem statement. Section 4 gives
   the Layer 3 traffic forwarding model. Section 5 provides a
   distributed gateway solution overview. Section 6 gives a detailed
   distributed gateway solution example. And Section 7 describes the
   TRILL protocol extensions needed to support this distributed gateway
   solution.

   The terms and acronyms in [RFC6325] are used with the following
   additions:

         ARP: Address Resolution Protocol [RFC826].

         Campus: The name for a network using the TRILL protocol in the

         VN: Virtual Network. In a TRILL campus, a unique 12-bit VLAN ID
   or a 24-bit Fine Grained Label [RFC7172] identifies each virtual
   network.

         VRF: Virtual Routing and Forwarding. In IP-based computer
   networks, Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) technology supports
   multiple instances of routing tables existing within the same router
   at the same time.

3. Simplified Example and Problem Statement

   There is normally a Data Label (VLAN or FGL) associated with each IP
   subnet. For traffic within a subnet, that is IP traffic to another
   end station in the same Data Label attached to the TRILL campus, the
   end station just ARPs for the MAC address of the destination end
   station's IP. It then uses this MAC address for traffic to that
   destination. TRILL routes the ingressed TRILL data packets to the
   destination's edge RBridge based on the egress nickname for that
   destination MAC address and Data Label. This is the regular TRILL
   base protocol [RFC6325] process.

   If two end stations of the same tenant are on different subnets and
   need to communicate with each other, their packets are typically
   forwarded to an IP Layer 3 gateway that performs L3 routing and, if
   necessary, changes the Data Label. Either a centralized layer 3
   gateway solution or the distributed layer 3 gateway solution
   specified in this document can be used for the inter-subnet traffic
   forwarding.

   Section 3.1 gives a simplified example in a TRILL campus with and
   without a distributed layer 3 gateway using VLAN Data Labels.
   Section 3.2 gives the detailed description of the problem without a
   distributed layer 3 gateway. The remainder of this document,
   particularly Section 5, describes the distributed gateway solution
   in detail.

Internet-Draft    TRILL Distributed Layer 3 Gateway      September 2015


   Assume a centralized gateway solution is used with both COR1 and
   COR2 acting as centralized gateways for redundancy in figure 1. COR1
   and COR2 each have four gateway interfaces for the four subnets in
   the tenant. In centralized layer 3 gateway solution, all traffic
   within the tenant between different VLANs must go through the
   centralized layer 3 gateway device of COR1 or COR2, even if the
   traffic is between two end stations connected to the same edge
   RBridge, because only the layer 3 gateway can change the VLAN
   labeling of the traffic.

   This is generally sub-optimal because the two end stations may be
   connected to the same ToR where L3 switching could have been
   performed locally. For example, in above Figure 1, the unicast IP
   traffic between ES1 and ES2 has to go through a centralized gateway
   of COR1 or COR2. It can't be locally routed between them on TOR1.
   However, if an edge RBridge has the distributed gateway capabilities
   specified in this document, then it can still perform optimum L2
   forwarding for intra-subnet traffic and, in addition, optimum L3
   forwarding for inter-subnet traffic, thus delivering optimum
   forwarding for unicast packets in all important cases.

   With a distributed layer 3 gateway, each edge RBridge acts as a
   default layer 3 gateway for local connecting ESs and has IP router
   capabilities to direct IP communications to other edge RBridges.
   Each edge RBridge only needs gateway interfaces for local connecting
   ESs, i.e., RB1 and RB2 need gateway interfaces only for VLAN 10 and
   VLAN 11 while RB3 and RB4 need gateway interfaces only for VLAN 12
   and VLAN 13. No device needs to maintain gateway interfaces for all
   VLANs in entire network. This will enhance the scalability in terms
   of number of tenants and subnets per tenant.

   When each end station ARPs for their layer 3 gateway, that is, their
   IP router, the edge RBridge to which it is connected will respond
   with that RBridge's 'gateway MAC'. When the end station later sends
   IP traffic to the layer 3 gateway, which it does if the destination
   IP is outside of its subnet, the edge RBridge intercepts the IP
   packet because the destination MAC is its gateway MAC. That RBridge
   routes the IP packet using the routing instance associated with that
   tenant, handling it in one of three ways:

           (1) ES1 communicates with ES2. The destination IP is
   connected to the same edge RBridge, the RBridge of TOR1 can simply
   transmit the IP packet out the right edge port in the destination
   VLAN.

           (2) If the destination IP is located in an outside network,
   the edge RBridge encapsulates it as a TRILL Data packet and sends it

Internet-Draft    TRILL Distributed Layer 3 Gateway      September 2015


   to the actual TRILL campus edge RBridge connecting to an external IP
   router.

           (3) ES1 communicates with ES4. The destination end station
   is connected to a different edge RBridge, the ingress RBridge TOR1
   uses TRILL encapsulation to route the IP packet to the correct
   egress RBridge TOR2, using the egress RBridge's gateway MAC and an
   Inner.VLAN identifying the tenant. Finally, the egress RBridge
   terminates the TRILL encapsulation and routes the IP packet to the
   destination end station based on the routing instance for that
   tenant.



3.2. Problem Statement Summary

   With Fine Grained Labeling [RFC7172], in theory, up to 16 million
   Layer 2 VN can be supported in a TRILL campus. To support inter-
   subnet traffic, a very large number of Layer 3 gateway interfaces
   could be needed on a centralized gateway, if each VN corresponds to
   a subnet and there are many tenant with many subnets per tenant. It
   is a big burden for the centralized gateway to support so many
   interfaces. In addition all inter-subnet traffic will go through a
   centralized gateway that may become the traffic bottleneck.

   The centralized gateway has the following issues:

            1. Sub-optimum forwarding paths for inter-subnet traffic
   due to the   requirements to perform IP routing and possibly change
   Data Labels at a centralized gateway.

            2. The centralized gateway may need to support a very large
   number of   gateway interfaces, in a data center one per tenant per
   data label used by that tenant, to provide interconnect
   functionality for all the layer 2 virtual networks in the TRILL
   campus.

            3. There may be a traffic bottleneck at the centralized
   gateway.



   A distributed gateway on edge RBridges addresses these issues.
   Through the distributed layer 3 gateway solution, the inter-subnet
   traffic is fully dispersed and is transmitted along optimal pair-
   wise forwarding path, improving network efficiency.

   Figure 2. Edge RBridge Model as Distributed Gateway

   In a data center network, each tenant has one or more Layer 2
   virtual networks and, in normal cases, each tenant corresponds to
   one routing domain. Normally each Layer 2 virtual network uses a
   different Data Label and corresponds to one or more IP subnets.

   Each Layer 2 virtual network in a TRILL campus is identified by a
   unique 12-bit VLAN ID or 24-bit Fine Grained Label [RFC7172].
   Different routing domains may have overlapping address space but
   need distinct and separate routes. The end stations that belong to
   the same subnet communicate through L2 forwarding, end stations of
   the same tenant that belong to different subnets communicate through
   L3 routing.

   Figure 2 depicts the model where there are n VRFs corresponding to n
   tenants with each tenant having up to m segments/subnets (virtual
   network).

5. Distributed Gateway Solution Details

   With the TRILL distributed gateway solution, an edge RBridge
   continues to perform Layer 2 routing for the ESs that are on the
   same subnet but performs IP routing for the ESs that are on the
   different subnets of the same tenant.

Internet-Draft    TRILL Distributed Layer 3 Gateway      September 2015


   As the IP address space in different routing domains can overlap,
   VRF instances need to be created on each edge RBridge to isolate the
   IP forwarding process for different routing domains present on the
   edge RBridge. A globally unique tenant ID identifies each routing
   domain. The network operator should ensure the consistency of the
   tenant ID on each edge RBridge for each routing domain. If a routing
   domain spreads over multiple edge RBridges, routing information for
   the routing domain is synchronized among these edge RBridges to
   ensure reachability to all ESs in that routing domain. The routing
   information is, in effect, labeled with the Tenant ID to
   differentiate the routing domains.

   From the data plane perspective, all edge RBridges are connected to
   each other via one or more TRILL hops, however they are always just
   a single IP hop away. When an ingress RBridge receives inter-subnet
   IP traffic from a local ES whose destination MAC is the edge
   RBridge's gateway MAC, that RBridge will perform Ethernet header
   termination and look up in its IP routing table how to route the
   traffic to the IP next hop. If the destination ES is connected to a
   remote edge RBridge, the remote RBridge will be the IP next hop for
   traffic forwarding. For such inter-subnet traffic, the ingress
   RBridge will perform layer 2 encapsulation to the remote RBridge's
   gateway MAC and TRILL encapsulation to the remote RBridge's nickname.
   TRILL then routes it to the remote edge RBridge through the TRILL
   campus.

   When that remote edge RBridge receives the traffic, it will
   decapsulate the TRILL data packet and see that the inner destination
   MAC is its gateway MAC.  It then terminates the inner Ethernet
   encapsulation and looks up the destination IP in the RBridge's IP
   forwarding table for the tenant indicated by the inner Data Label to
   route it to the destination ES.

   Through this method, TRILL with distributed gateways provides
   optimum pair-wise data routing for inter-subnet traffic.

5.1. Local Routing Information

   An ES can be locally connected to an edge RBridges through a layer 2
   network (such as a point-to-point Ethernet link or a bridged LAN) or
   externally connected through a layer 3 IP network.

   If the ES is connected to an edge RBridge through a Layer 2 network,
   then the edge RBridge acts as a Layer 3 Gateway for the ES. A
   gateway interface is established on the edge RBridge for the
   connecting ES. Because the ESs in a subnet may be spread over
   multiple edge RBridges, each of these edge RBridges establishes its

Internet-Draft    TRILL Distributed Layer 3 Gateway      September 2015


   gateway interface for the subnet and these gateway interfaces on
   different edge RBridges share the same gateway MAC and gateway IP
   address.

   With distributed gateway, the edge RBridge to which an end station
   is connected appears to be the local IP router on its link. As in
   any IP network, before the end station starts to send inter-subnet
   traffic, it acquires its gateway's MAC through the ARP/ND process.
   Local connecting edge RBridges that support this distributed gateway
   feature always respond with the gateway MAC address when receiving
   ARP/ND requests for the gateway IP. Through the ARP/ND process, the
   edge RBridge can learn the IP and MAC correspondence of a local ES
   connected to the edge RBridge by Layer 2 and then generate local IP
   routing entries for that ES in the corresponding routing domain.

   An IP router connected to an edge RBridge looks to TRILL like an ES.
   If a router/ES is located in an external IP network, normally it
   provides access to one or more IP prefixes. The router/ES should run
   an IP routing protocol with the connecting TRILL edge Rbridge. The
   edge RBridge will learn the IP prefixes behind the router/ES through
   that IP routing protocol, then the RBridge will generate local IP
   routing entries in the corresponding routing domain.

5.2. Local Routing Information Synchronization

   When a routing instance is created on an edge RBridge, the tenant ID,
   tenant Label (VLAN or FGL), tenant gateway MAC, and their
   correspondence should be set and globally advertised (see Section
   7.1).

   When an ingress RBridge performs inter-subnet traffic TRILL
   encapsulation, the ingress RBridge uses the Label advertised by the
   egress RBridge as the inner VLAN or FGL and uses the tenant gateway
   MAC advertised by the egress RBridge as the Inner.MacDA. The egress
   RBridge relies on this tenant Data Label to find the local VRF
   instance for the IP forwarding process when receiving inter-subnet
   traffic from the TRILL campus. (The role of tenant Label is akin to
   an MPLS VPN Label in an MPLS IP/MPLS VPN network.) Tenant Data
   Labels are independently allocated on each edge RBridge for each
   routing domain. An edge RBridge can use an access Data Label from a
   routing domain to act as the inter-subnet Label, or the edge RBridge
   can use a Label different from any access Labels to be a tenant
   Label. It's implementation dependant and there is no restriction on
   this. The tenant gateway MAC differentiates inter-subnet Layer 3
   traffic or intra-subnet Layer 2 traffic on the egress RBridge. Each
   tenant on a RBridge can use a different gateway MAC or same tenant



Hao & Li, etc           Expires March 9, 2016                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft    TRILL Distributed Layer 3 Gateway      September 2015


   gateway MAC for inter-subnet traffic purposes. This is also
   implementation dependant and there is no restriction on it.

   When a local IP prefix is learned in a routing instance on an edge
   RBridge, the edge RBridge should advertise the IP prefix information
   for the routing instance so that other edge RBridges will generate
   IP routing entries. If the ESs in a VN are spread over multiple
   RBridges, these RBridges should advertise each local connecting end
   station's IP address in the VN to other RBridges. If the ESs in a VN
   are only connected to one edge RBridge, that RBridge only needs to
   advertise the subnet corresponding to the VN to other RBridges. A
   globally unique tenant ID is also carried in the advertisement to
   differentiate IP prefixes between different tenants, because the IP
   address space of different tenants can overlap (see Sections 7.3 and
   7.4).

   If a tenant is deleted on an edge Rbridge RB1, RB1 notifies all
   other edge Rbridges to delete the tenant Label, tenant gateway MAC,
   and related IP prefixes that were local to RB1 by withdrawing its
   advertisement of that information. If there is a new tenant which is
   created and the original's tenant label is assigned to the new
   tenant immediately, it may cause a security policy violation for the
   traffic in flight, because when the egress Rbridge receives traffic
   from the old tenant, it will forward it in the new tenant's routing
   instance and deliver it to wrong destination. So tenant Label MUST
   NOT be re-allocated until a reasonable amount of time has passed to
   allow any traffic in flight to be discarded.

   When the ARP entry in an edge Rbridge for an ES times out, it will
   trigger an edge Rbridge LSP advertisement to other edge Rbridges
   with the corresponding IP routing entry deleted. If the ES is an IP
   router, the edge Rbridge also notifies other edge Rbridges that they
   must delete the routing entries corresponding to the IP prefixes
   accessible through that IP router. During the IP prefix deleting
   process, if there is traffic in flight, the traffic will be
   discarded at the egress Rbridge because there is no local IP routing
   entry to the destination.

   If an edge Rbridge changes its tenant gateway MAC, it will trigger
   an edge Rbridge LSP advertisement to other edge Rbridges giving the
   new gateway MAC to be used as Inner.MacDA for future traffic
   destined to the edge Rbridge. During the gateway MAC changing
   process, if there is traffic in flight using the old gateway MAC as
   Inner.MacDA, the traffic will be discarded or be forwarded as layer
   2 intra-subnet traffic on the edge Rbridge. If the inter-subnet
   tenant Label is a unique Label that is different from any access
   Labels, when the edge Rbridge receives the traffic whose Inner.MacDA


Hao & Li, etc           Expires March 9, 2016                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft    TRILL Distributed Layer 3 Gateway      September 2015


   is different from local tenant gateway MAC, the traffic will be
   discarded. If the edge RBridge uses one of the access Labels as
   inter-subnet tenant Label, the traffic will be forwarded as layer 2
   intra-subnet traffic unless a special traffic filtering policy is
   enforced on the edge Rbridge.

   If there are multiple nicknames owned by an edge RBridge, the edge
   RBridge also can specify one nickname as the egress nickname for
   inter-subnet traffic forwarding. A NickFlags APPsub-TLV with the SE-
   flag set can be used for this purpose. If the edge RBridge doesn't
   specify a nickname for this purpose, the ingress RBridge can use any
   one of the nicknames owned by the egress as the egress nickname for
   inter-subnet traffic forwarding.

   TRILL E-L1FS FS-LSP [rfc7180bis] APPsub-TLVs are used for IP routing
   information synchronization in each routing domain among edge
   RBridges. Based on the synchronized information from other edge
   RBridges, each edge RBridge generates routing entries in each
   routing domain for remote IP addresses and subnets.

   Through this solution, the intra-subnet forwarding function and
   inter-subnet IP routing functions are integrated and network
   management and deployment is simplified.

5.3. Active-active Access

   TRILL active-active service provides end stations with flow level
   load balance and resilience against link failures at the edge of
   TRILL campuses as described in [RFC7379].

   If an ES is connected to two TRILL RBridges, say RB1 and RB2, in
   active-active mode, RB1 and RB2 each act as a distributed layer 3
   gateway for the ES. RB1 and RB2 each learn the ES's IP address
   through ARP/ND process and then they announce the IP address to the
   TRILL campus independently. The remote ingress RBridge will generate
   an IP routing entry corresponding with the IP address with two IP
   next hops of RB1 and RB2. When the ingress RBridge receives inter-
   subnet traffic from a local access network, the ingress RBridge
   selects RB1 or RB2 as the IP next hop based on local load balancing
   algorithm, then the traffic will be transmitted to the selected next
   hop destination RB1 or RB2 through the TRILL campus.

5.4. Data Traffic Forwarding Process

   After a Layer 2 connected ES1 in VLAN-x acquires its gateway's MAC,
   it can start inter-subnet data traffic transmission to ES2 in VLAN-y.



Hao & Li, etc           Expires March 9, 2016                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft    TRILL Distributed Layer 3 Gateway      September 2015


   When the edge RBridge attached to ES1 receives inter-subnet traffic
   from ES1, that RBridge performs Layer 2 header termination, then,
   using the local VRF corresponding to VLAN-x, it performs the IP
   routing process in that VRF.

   If destination ES2 is attached to the same edge RBridge, the traffic
   will be locally forwarded to ES2 by that RBridge. Compared to the
   centralized gateway solution, the forwarding path is optimal and a
   traffic detour through the centralized gateway is avoided.

   If ES2 is attached to a remote edge RBridge, the remote edge RBridge
   is IP next hop and the inter-subnet traffic is forwarded to the IP
   next hop through TRILL encapsulation. If there are multiple equal
   cost shortest path between ingress RBridge and egress RBridge, all
   these path can be used for inter-subnet traffic forwarding, so load
   spreading can be achieved for inter-subnet traffic.

   When the remote RBridge receives the inter-subnet TRILL encapsulated
   traffic, the RBridge decapsulates the TRILL encapsulation and checks
   the Inner.MacDA, if that MAC address is the local gateway MAC
   corresponding to the inner Label (VLAN or FGL), the inner Label will
   be used to find the corresponding local VRF, then the IP routing
   process in that VRF will be performed, and the traffic will be
   locally forwarded to the destination ES2.

   In summary, this solution avoids traffic detours through a central
   gateway, both inter-subnet and intra-subnet traffic can be forwarded
   along pair-wise shortest paths, and network bandwidth is conserved.

   campus:

            Tenant ID: 1

            Tenant gateway MAC: MAC1

            Tenant VLAN for Tenant1: VLAN 100.

            IP prefix in Tenant1: 10.1.1.2/32.

      RB2 announces the following local routing information to TRILL
   campus:

            Tenant ID: 1

            Tenant gateway MAC: MAC2

            Tenant VLAN for Tenant1: VLAN 100.

            IP prefix in Tenant1: 20.1.1.2/32.

   Relying on the routing information from RB2, remote routing entries
   on RB1 are generated as follows:

   |  Prefix/Mask | Inner.MacDA | inner VLAN   | egress nickname|

6.2. Data Plane Process

   Assuming ES1 sends unicast inter-subnet traffic to ES2, the traffic
   forwarding process is as follows:

         1. ES1 sends unicast inter-subnet traffic to RB1 with RB1's
   gateway's MAC as the destination MAC.

         2. Ingress RBridge (RB1) forwarding process:




Hao & Li, etc           Expires March 9, 2016                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft    TRILL Distributed Layer 3 Gateway      September 2015


   RB1 checks the destination MAC, if the destination MAC equals the
   local gateway MAC, the gateway function will terminate the Layer 2
   header and perform L3 routing.

   RB1 looks up IP routing table information by destination IP and
   Tenant ID to get IP next hop information, which includes the egress
   RBridge's gateway MAC (MAC2), tenant VLAN (VLAN 100) and egress
   nickname (nick2). Using this information, RB1 will perform inner
   Ethernet header encapsulation and TRILL encapsulation. RB1 will use
   MAC2 as the Inner.MacDA, MAC1 (RB1's own gateway MAC) as the
   Inner.MacSA, VLAN 100 as the Inner.VLAN, nick2 as the egress
   nickname and nick1 as the ingress nickname.

   RB1 looks up TRILL forwarding information by egress nickname and
   sends the traffic to the TRILL next hop as per [RFC6325]. The
   traffic will be sent to RB3 or RB4 as a result of load balancing.

   Assuming the traffic is forwarded to RB3, the following occurs:

         3. Transit RBridge (RB3) forwarding process:

   RB3 looks up TRILL forwarding information by egress nickname and
   forwards the traffic to RB2 as per [RFC6325].

         4. Egress RBridge forwarding process:

   As the egress nickname is RB2's own nickname, RB2 performs TRILL
   decapsulation. Then it checks the Inner.MacDA and, because that MAC
   is equal to the local gateway MAC, performs inner Ethernet header
   termination. Using the inner VLAN, RB2 finds the local corresponding
   VRF and looks up the packets destination IP address in the VRF's IP
   routing table. The traffic is then be locally forwarded to ES2.

7. TRILL Protocol Extensions

   If an edge RBridge RB1 participates in the distributed gateway
   function, it announces its tenant gateway MAC and tenant Data Label
   to the TRILL campus through the tenant Label and gateway MAC APPsub-
   TLV, it should announce its local IPv4 and IPv6 prefixs through the
   IPv4 Prefix APPsub-TLV and the IPv6 Prefix APPsub-TLV respectively.
   If RB1 has multiple nicknames, it can announce one nickname for
   distributed gateway use using Nickname Flags APPsub-TLV with "SE"
   Flag set to one.

   The remote ingress RBridges belonging to the same routing domain use
   this   information to generate IP routing entries in that routing
   domain. These RBridges use the nickname, tenant gateway MAC, and

   tenant Label of RB1 to perform inter-subnet traffic TRILL
   encapsulation when they receive inter-subnet traffic from a local ES.
   The nickname is used as the egress nickname, the tenant gateway MAC
   is used as the Inner.MacDA, and the tenant Data Label is used as the
   Inner.Label. The following APPsub-TLVs MUST be included in a TRILL

   fields in octets. A value of 0 indicates that no IPv4 prefix is being
   advertised.

         o Tenant ID: This identifies a global tenant ID.

         o Prefix Length: The Prefix Length field indicates the length
   in bits of the IPv4 address prefix.  A length of zero indicates a
   prefix that matches all IPv4 addresses (with prefix, itself, of zero
   octets).

         o Prefix: The Prefix field contains an IPv4 address prefix,
   followed by enough trailing bits to make the end of the field fall on
   an octet boundary. Note that the value of the trailing bits is
   irrelevant. For example, if the Prefix Length is 12, indicating 12
   bits, then the Prefix is 2 octets and the low order 4 bits of the
   Prefix are irrelevant.

         o Type: Set to IPV6-PREFIX sub-TLV type (TBD3). Two bytes,
   because this   APPsub-TLV appears in an extended TLV [RFC7356].

         o Total Length: This 2-byte unsigned integer indicates the
   total length of the Tenant ID, the Prefix Length, and the Prefix
   fields in octets. A value of 0 indicates that no IPv6 prefix is being
   advertised.

         o Tenant ID: This identifies a global tenant ID.

         o Prefix Length: The Prefix Length field indicates the length
   in bits of the IPv6 address prefix.  A length of zero indicates a
   prefix that matches all IPv6 addresses (with prefix, itself, of zero
   octets).

         o Prefix: The Prefix field contains an IPv6 address prefix,
   followed by enough trailing bits to make the end of the field fall on
   an octet boundary. Note that the value of the trailing bits is
   irrelevant. For example, if the Prefix Length is 100, indicating 100
   bits, then the Prefix is 13 octets and the low order 4 bits of the
   Prefix are irrelevant.

8. Security Considerations

   Correct configuration of the edge RBridges participating is
   important to assure that data is not delivered to the wrong tenant,
   which would violate security constrains. IS-IS security [RFC5310]
   can be used to secure the information advertised by the edge
   RBridges in LSPs and FS-LSPs.

   See Section 5.2 for constraints on re-use of a tenant ID and on
   tenant gateway MAC change to avoid the mishandling of data in flight.

   Particularly sensitive data should be encrypted end-to-end, that is,
   from the source end station to the destination end station.

   For general TRILL Security Considerations, see [RFC6325].

9. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign three APPsub-TLV type numbers from the
   range less than 255 and update the "TRILL APPsub-TLV Types under IS-
   IS TLV 251 Application Identifier 1" registry as follows:

      Type    Name               References

      ----   ----------------   ------------

      TBD1   TENANT-GWMAC-LABEL [this document]

      TBD2   IPV4-PREFIX        [this document]

      TBD3   IPV6-PREFIX        [this document]

   IANA is requested to assign a flag bit in the NickFlags APPsub-TLV
   as described in Section 7.2 and update the ''Nick Flags'' registry,
   created by [rfc7180bis], as follows:
