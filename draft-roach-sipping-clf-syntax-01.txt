Internet-Draft   Binary Syntax for SIP Common Log Format        May 2009


1.  Introduction

   The Common Log File (CLF) format for the Session Initiation Protocol
   (SIP) [I-D.gurbani-sipping-clf] proposes a syntax for logging SIP
   messages received and sent by SIP clients, servers, and proxies.  The
   syntax proposed by that document has been inspired by the common HTTP
   log format.  However, experience with that format has shown that
   dealing with large quantities of log data can be very processor
   intensive, as doing so necessary requires reading and parsing every
   byte in the log file(s) of interest.

   This document counter-proposes a format that is no more difficult to
   generate by logging entities, while being radically faster to
   process.  In particular, the format is optimized for both rapidly
   scanning through log records, as well as quickly locating commonly-
   accessed data fields.  Both operations can be performed in constant
   time (as compared with O(n) time associated with the current format,
   where n is the length of the log record).

   Further, the format proposed by this document retains the ability to
   be read by humans and processed using traditional Unix text
   processing tools, such as sed, awk, perl, cut, and grep.


2.  Format

   Each data record is encoded according to the following format.  Note
   that indications of "hexadecimal encoded" indicate that the value is
   to be written out in human-readable base-16 numbers using the ASCII
   characters 0x30 through 0x39 and 0x41 through 0x46 ('0' through '9'
   and 'A' through 'F').  Similarly, indications of "decimal encoded"
   indicate that the value is to be written out in human readable
   base-10 number using the ASCII characters 0x30 through 0x39 ('0'
   through '9').  In both encodings, numbers always take up the number
   of bytes indicated, and are padded on the left with ASCII '0'
   characters to fill the entire space.

   First, an 80-byte header indicates meta-data about the record.  Note
   that the field lengths encoded in the header do not include the ASCII
   tab characters used to separate fields from each other.

   Version (1 byte):  0x41 for this document

   Flags Field (3 bytes):
      byte 1 -   Request/Response flag (R = request, r = response)
      byte 2 -   Retransmission flag (o = original transmission; d =
         duplicate transmission; s = server is stateless [i.e.,
         retransmissions are not detected])
      byte 3 -   Sent/Received flag (r = message received, s = message
         sent)

   Record Length (6 bytes):  Hexadecimal-Encoded Total length of this
      log record, including "Flags" and "Record Length" fields, and
      terminating line-feed

   Bytes 12 through 72 contain hexadecimal-encoded pointer/length pairs
   that point to the values of variable-length mandatory fields.  The
   "Pointer" fields indicate absolute byte values within the record, and
   must be >= 103.  They point to the start of the corresponding value
   within the "Mandatory Fields" area.  The "Length" fields indicate the
   length of the corresponding value.  The final pointer, "TLV Start
   Pointer," points to the ASCII Tab (0x09) character for the first
   entry in the Tag/Length/Value area; if no such entries are present,
   this value is set to zero.

   Note that the "Length" fields do not include the tab delimiters

   between fields.  Further note that there are no delimiters between
   these pointer/length values -- they are packed together as a single,
   68-character hexadecimal encoded string.

   Following the pointer/length pairs, several fixed-length fields are
   encoded.  As before, all fields are completely filled, pre-pending
   values with '0' characters as necessary.

   Date/Time (10 bytes):  Seconds since midnight, January 1st, 1970,
      GMT; decimal encoded

   Fraction Seconds (6 bytes):  Microseconds since the time in Date/Time
      field; decimal encoded

   CSeq Number (10 bytes):  CSeq number from the SIP message; decimal
      encoded

   Response Code (3 bytes):  Set to the value of the response code for
      responses.  Set to 0 for requests.  Decimal encoded.

   Mandatory Field Data:  Contains actual values for the mandatory
      fields.  This data must appear in the order listed, and each field
      must be present.  Fields are separated by a single ASCII Tab
      character (0x09).  Any tab characters present in the data to be
      written will be replaced by an ASCII space character (0x20) prior
      to being logged.


      Server Txn:  The transaction identifier associated with the server
         transaction.  Implementations MAY reuse the server transaction
         identifier (the topmost branch-id of the incoming request, with
         or without the magic cookie), or they MAY generate a unique
         identification string for a server transaction (this identifier
         needs to be locally unique to the server only.)  This
         identifier is used to correlate ACKs and CANCELs to an INVITE
         transaction; it is also used to aid in forking.

      Client Txn:  This field is used to associate client transactions
         with a server transaction for forking proxies or B2BUAs.

      Method:  In requests, the method from the start line.  In
         responses, the method found in the CSeq header field.

      To Value:  Value of the To header field, possibly with the tag
         parameter removed.  (Whether to remove the tag parameter is
         left up to the logging entity).

Internet-Draft   Binary Syntax for SIP Common Log Format        May 2009


      To Tag:  Value of the To header field tag parameter.  If no To
         header field tag parameter is present, the pointer field is
         ignored; the length field is set to 0; and the field in the
         mandatory section is encoded as a single ASCII dash (0x2D).

      From Value:  Value of the From header field, possibly with the tag
         parameter removed.  (Whether to remove the tag parameter is
         left up to the logging entity)

      From Tag:  Value of the From header field tag parameter.

      Call-Id:  The value of the Call-ID header field


   After the "Mandatory Fields" section, Tag/Length/Value groups appear
   zero or more times.  The location within the log record is indicated
   by the "TLV Start Ptr" field.  They are used to log information that
   is not mandatory for all messages (although specific TLVs are
   mandatory in request logs).


   Tag Field (4 bytes):  indicates the type of value coded by this TLV;
      hexadecimal encoded.  Currently defined tags are:

      0x0000 -  Contact value (can be repeated)
         Contains entire value of Contact header field

      0x0001 -  Request URI (mandatory in request)
         Contains Request URI in start line

      0x0002 -  Remote Host (mandatory in request)
         The DNS name of IP address from which the message was received
         (if "sent/received flag" is 0) of the IP address to which the
         message is being send (if "sent/received flag" is 1)

      0x0003 -  Authenticated User
         Contains the user name by which the user has been authenticated

      0x0004 -  Complete SIP Message (optional, should be omitted by
         default)
         Contains complete SIP message.  Can be repeated multiple times
         to accommodate SIP messages that exceed 65535 bytes in length.

   Length Field (2 bytes):  indicates the length of the value coded in
      this TLV, hexadecimal encoded.  This length does NOT include the
      TLV header.

   Value Field (0 to 65535 bytes):  contains the actual value of this
      TLV.  As with the mandatory fields, ASCII Tab characters (0x09)
      are replaced with ASCII space characters (0x20).




3.  Example Record

   The following demonstrates approximately how a single log record
   appears in a logging file.  Due to internet-draft conventions, this
   log entry has been split into ten lines, instead of the two lines
   that actually appear in a log file; and the tab characters have been
   padded out using spaces to simulate their appearance in a text
   terminal.

   0072000D00800000008100060088002000A9000600B0002500D6000A00E100270108

4.  Text Tool Considerations

   This format has been designed to allow text tools to easily process
   logs without needing to understand the indexing format.  Index lines
   may be rapidly discarded by checking the first character of the line:
   index lines will always start with an alphabetical character, while
   field lines will start with a numerical character.

   Within a field line, script tools can quickly split fields at the tab
   characters.  The first 11 fields are positional, and the meaning of
   any subsequent fields can be determined by checking the first four
   characters of the field.  Alternately, these non-positional fields
   can be located using a regular expression.  For example, the "Request
   URI" in a request can be found by searching for the perl regex
   /\t0001,....,([^\t]*)/.

   Note also that requests can be distinguished from responses by
   checking the third positional field -- for requests, it will always
   be set to "000"; any other value indicates a response.

   Cullen put me up to this.

   Tom Taylor suggested the technique of combining the length field
   structure from the binary format with the human-readable ASCII format
   to allow both rapid processing by advanced tools, and easy processing
   by simpler, text-centric tools.  Dean Willis suggested the use of tab
   delimiters as a means to avoid the need to escape values within a
   field.  Vijay Gurbani provided significant feedback, and wrote the
   original proof-of-concept program which was adapted to produce the
   examples in this document.
