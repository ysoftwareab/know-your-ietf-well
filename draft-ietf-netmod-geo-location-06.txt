1.  Introduction

   In many applications we would like to specify the location of
   something geographically.  Some examples of locations in networking
   might be the location of data center, a rack in an internet exchange
   point, a router, a firewall, a port on some device, or it could be
   the endpoints of a fiber, or perhaps the failure point along a fiber.

   Additionally, while this location is typically relative to Earth, it
   does not need to be.  Indeed it is easy to imagine a network or
   device located on The Moon, on Mars, on Enceladus (the moon of
   Saturn) or even a comet (e.g., 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko).

   Finally, one can imagine defining locations using different frames of
   reference or even alternate systems (e.g., simulations or virtual
   realities).

   This document defines a "geo-location" YANG grouping that allows for
   all of the above data to be captured.

   This specification conforms to [ISO.6709.2008].

   The YANG data model described in this document conforms to the
   Network Management Datastore Architecture defined in [RFC8342].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals,
   as shown here.

2.  The Geo Location Object

2.1.  Frame of Reference

   The frame of reference ("reference-frame") defines what the location
   values refer to and their meaning.  The referred to object can be any
   astronomical body.  It could be a planet such as Earth or Mars, a
   moon such as Enceladus, an asteroid such as Ceres, or even a comet
   such as 1P/Halley.  This value is specified in "astronomical-body"
   and is defined by the International Astronomical Union
   (http://www.iau.org).  The default "astronomical-body" value is
   "earth".

   In addition to identifying the astronomical body we also need to
   define the meaning of the coordinates (e.g., latitude and longitude)
   and the definition of 0-height.  This is done with a "geodetic-datum"
   value.  The default value for "geodetic-datum" is "wgs-84" (i.e., the
   World Geodetic System, [WGS84]), which is used by the Global
   Positioning System (GPS) among many others.  We define an IANA
   registry for specifying standard values for the "geodetic-datum".

   In addition to the "geodetic-datum" value we allow refining the
   coordinate and height accuracy using "coord-accuracy" and "height-
   accuracy" respectively.  When specified these values override the
   defaults implied by the "geodetic-datum" value.

   Finally, we define an optional feature which allows for changing the
   system for which the above values are defined.  This optional feature
   adds an "alternate-system" value to the reference frame.  This value
   is normally not present which implies the natural universe is the
   system.  The use of this value is intended to allow for creating
   virtual realities or perhaps alternate coordinate systems.  The
   definition of alternate systems is outside the scope of this
   document.

2.2.  Location

   This is the location on or relative to the astronomical object.  It
   is specified using 2 or 3 coordinates values.  These values are given
   either as "latitude", "longitude", and an optional "height", or as
   Cartesian coordinates of "x", "y" and "z".  For the standard location
   choice "latitude" and "longitude" are specified as fractions of
   decimal degrees, and the "height" value is in fractions of meters.
   For the Cartesian choice "x", "y" and "z" are in fractions of meters.
   In both choices the exact meanings of all of the values are defined
   by the "geodetic-datum" value in the Section 2.1.

2.3.  Motion

   Support is added for objects in relatively stable motion.  For
   objects in relatively stable motion the grouping provides a
   3-dimensional vector value.  The components of the vector are
   "v-north", "v-east" and "v-up" which are all given in fractional
   meters per second.  The values "v-north" and "v-east" are relative to
   true-north as defined by the reference frame for the astronomical
   body, "v-up" is perpendicular to the plane defined by "v-north" and
   "v-east", and is pointed away from the center of mass.

   To derive the 2-dimensional heading and speed one would use the
   following formulas:

                 ,------------------------------
       speed =  V  v_{north}^{2} + v_{east}^{2}

       heading = arctan(v_{east} / v_{north})

   For some applications that demand high accuracy, and where the data
   is infrequently updated this velocity vector can track very slow
   movement such as continental drift.

   Tracking more complex forms of motion is outside the scope of this
   work.  The intent of the grouping being defined here is to identify
   where something is located, and generally this is expected to be
   somewhere on or relative to Earth (or another astronomical body).  At

   least two options are available to YANG models that wish to use this
   grouping with objects that are changing location frequently in non-
   simple ways, they can add additional motion data to their model
   directly, or if the application allows it can require more frequent
   queries to keep the location data current.

2.4.  Nested Locations

   When locations are nested (e.g., a building may have a location which
   houses routers that also have locations) the module using this
   grouping is free to indicate in its definition that the "reference-
   frame" is inherited from the containing object so that the
   "reference-frame" need not be repeated in every instance of location
   data.

2.5.  Non-location Attributes

   During the development of this module, the question of whether it
   would support data such as orientation arose.  These types of
   attributes are outside the scope of this grouping because they do not
   deal with a location but rather describe something more about the
   object that is at the location.  Module authors are free to add these
   non-location attributes along with their use of this location
   grouping.

2.6.  Tree

   The following is the YANG tree diagram [RFC8340] for the geo-location
   grouping.

   <CODE ENDS>

4.  ISO 6709:2008 Conformance

   [ISO.6709.2008] provides an appendix with a set of tests for
   conformance to the standard.  The tests and results are given in the
   following table along with an explanation of non-applicable tests.

           +---------+----------------------+------------------+

                     Table 1: Conformance Test Results

   For test "A.1.2.1" the YANG geo location object either includes a CRS
   ("reference-frame") or has a default defined ([WGS84]).

   For "A.1.2.3" we do not define our own CRS, and doing so is not
   required for conformance.

   For "A.1.2.6" we do not define a text string representation, which is
   also not required for conformance.

5.  Usability

   The geo-location object defined in this document and YANG module have
   been designed to be usable in a very broad set of applications.  This
   includes the ability to locate things on astronomical bodies other
   than Earth, and to utilize entirely different coordinate systems and
   realities.

   Many systems make use of geo-location data, and so it's important to
   be able describe this data using this geo-location object defined in
   this document.

5.1.  Portability

   In order to verify portability while developing this module the
   following standards and standard APIs and were considered.

5.1.1.  IETF URI Value

   [RFC5870] defines a standard URI value for geographic location data.
   It includes the ability to specify the "geodetic-value" (it calls
   this "crs") with the default being "wgs-84" [WGS84].  For the
   location data it allows 2 to 3 coordinates defined by the "crs"
   value.  For accuracy it has a single "u" parameter for specifying
   uncertainty.  The "u" value is in fractions of meters and applies to
   all the location values.  As the URI is a string, all values are
   specifies as strings and so are capable of as much precision as
   required.

   URI values can be mapped to and from the YANG grouping, with the
   caveat that some loss of precision (in the extremes) may occur due to
   the YANG grouping using decimal64 values rather than strings.

5.1.2.  W3C

   W3C Defines a geo-location API in [W3CGEO].  We show a snippet of
   code below which defines the geo-location data for this API.  This is
   used by many application (e.g., Google Maps API).

   interface GeolocationPosition {
     readonly attribute GeolocationCoordinates coords;
     readonly attribute DOMTimeStamp timestamp;
   };

   interface GeolocationCoordinates {
     readonly attribute double latitude;
     readonly attribute double longitude;
     readonly attribute double? altitude;
     readonly attribute double accuracy;
     readonly attribute double? altitudeAccuracy;

     readonly attribute double? speed;
   };

   accuracy (double)  Accuracy of "latitude" and "longitude" values in
      meters.

   altitude (double)  Optional height in meters above the [WGS84]
      ellipsoid.

   altitudeAccuracy (double)  Optional accuracy of "altitude" value in
      meters.

      increasing clock-wise.

   latitude, longitude (double)  Standard lat/long values in decimal
      degrees.

   speed (double)  Speed along heading in meters per second.

   timestamp (DOMTimeStamp)  Specifies milliseconds since the Unix EPOCH
      in 64 bit unsigned integer.  The YANG model defines the timestamp
      with arbitrarily large precision by using a string which
      encompasses all representable values of this timestamp value.

   W3C API values can be mapped to the YANG grouping, with the caveat
   that some loss of precision (in the extremes) may occur due to the
   YANG grouping using decimal64 values rather than doubles.

   Conversely, only YANG values for Earth using the default "wgs-84"
   [WGS84] as the "geodetic-datum", can be directly mapped to the W3C
   values, as W3C does not provide the extra features necessary to map
   the broader set of values supported by the YANG grouping.

5.1.3.  Geography Markup Language (GML)

   ISO adopted the Geography Markup Language (GML) defined by OGC 07-036
   as [ISO.19136.2007].  GML defines, among many other things, a
   position type "gml:pos" which is a sequence of "double" values.  This
   sequence of values represent coordinates in a given CRS.  The CRS is
   either inherited from containing elements or directly specified as
   attributes "srsName" and optionally "srsDimension" on the "gml:pos".

   GML defines an Abstract CRS type which Concrete CRS types derive
   from.  This allows for many types of CRS definitions.  We are
   concerned with the Geodetic CRS type which can have either
   ellipsoidal or Cartesian coordinates.  We believe that other non-
   Earth based CRS as well as virtual CRS should also be representable
   by the GML CRS types as well.

   Thus GML "gml:pos" values can be mapped directly to the YANG
   grouping, with the caveat that some loss of precision (in the
   extremes) may occur due to the YANG grouping using decimal64 values
   rather than doubles.

   Conversely, YANG grouping values can be mapped to GML as directly as
   the GML CRS available definitions allow with a minimum of Earth-based
   geodetic systems fully supported.

   GML also defines an observation value in "gml:Observation" which
   includes a timestamp value "gml:validTime" in addition to other
   components such as "gml:using" "gml:target" and "gml:resultOf".  Only
   the timestamp is mappable to and from the YANG grouping.  Furthermore
   "gml:validTime" can either be an Instantaneous measure
   ("gml:TimeInstant") or a time period ("gml:TimePeriod").  The
   instantaneous "gml:TimeInstant" is mappable to and from the YANG
   grouping "timestamp" value, and values down to the resolution of
   seconds for "gml:TimePeriod" can be mapped using the "valid-until"
   node of the YANG grouping.

5.1.4.  KML

   KML 2.2 [KML22] (formerly Keyhole Markup Language) was submitted by
   Google to the Open Geospatial Consortium,
   (https://www.opengeospatial.org/) and was adopted.  The latest
   version as of this writing is KML 2.3 [KML23].  This schema includes
   geographic location data in some of its objects (e.g., "kml:Point" or
   "kml:Camera" objects).  This data is provided in string format and
   corresponds to the [W3CGEO] values.  The timestamp value is also
   specified as a string as in our YANG grouping.

   KML has some special handling for the height value useful for
   visualization software, "kml:altitudeMode".  These values for
   "kml:altitudeMode" include indicating the height is ignored
   ("clampToGround"), in relation to the location's ground level
   ("relativeToGround"), or in relation to the geodetic datum
   ("absolute").  The YANG grouping can directly map the ignored and
   absolute cases, but not the relative to ground case.

   In addition to the "kml:altitudeMode" KML also defines two seafloor
   height values using "kml:seaFloorAltitudeMode".  One value is to
   ignore the height value ("clampToSeaFloor") and the other is relative
   ("relativeToSeaFloor").  As with the "kml:altitudeMode" value, the
   YANG grouping supports the ignore case but not the relative case.

   The KML location values use a geodetic datum defined in Annex A by
   the GML Coordinate Reference System (CRS) [ISO.19136.2007] with
   identifier "LonLat84_5773".  The altitude value for KML absolute
   height mode is measured from the vertical datum specified by [WGS84].

   Thus the YANG grouping and KML values can be directly mapped in both
   directions (when using a supported altitude mode) with the caveat
   that some loss of precision (in the extremes) may occur due to the
   YANG grouping using decimal64 values rather than strings.  For the
   relative height cases the application doing the transformation is
   expected to have the data available to transform the relative height
   into an absolute height which can then be expressed using the YANG
   grouping.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  Geodetic System Values Registry

   IANA is asked to create a new registry "Geodetic System Values" under
   a new protocol category group "YANG Geographic Location Parameters".

   This registry allocates names for standard geodetic systems.  Often
   these values are referred to using multiple names (e.g., full names
   or multiple acronyms values).  The intent of this registry is to
   provide a single standard value for any given geodetic system.

   The values SHOULD use an acronym when available, they MUST be
   converted to lower case, and spaces MUST be changed to dashes "-".

   Each entry should be sufficient to define the 3 coordinate values (2
   if height is not required).  So for example the "wgs-84" is defined
   as WGS-84 with the geoid updated by at least [EGM96] for height
   values.  Specific entries for [EGM96] and [EGM08] are present if a
   more precise definition of the data is required.

   It should be noted that [RFC5870] also creates a registry for
   Geodetic Systems (it calls CRS); however, this registry has a very
   strict modification policy.  The authors of [RFC5870] have the stated
   goal of making CRS registration hard to avoid proliferation of CRS
   values.  As our module defines alternate systems and has a broader
   (beyond Earth) scope, the registry defined below is meant to be more
   easily modified.

   The allocation policy for this registry is First Come First Served,
   [RFC8126] as the intent is simply to avoid duplicate values.

   The initial values for this registry are as follows.

   +------------+------------------------------------------------------+
   | Name       | Description                                          |
   +============+======================================================+
   | me         | Mean Earth/Polar Axis (Moon)                         |
   +------------+------------------------------------------------------+
   | mola-vik-1 | MOLA Height, IAU Viking-1 PM (Mars)                  |
   +------------+------------------------------------------------------+
   | wgs-84-96  | World Geodetic System 1984 [WGS84] w/ EGM96          |
   +------------+------------------------------------------------------+
   | wgs-84-08  | World Geodetic System 1984 [WGS84] w/ [EGM08]        |
   +------------+------------------------------------------------------+
   | wgs-84     | World Geodetic System 1984 [WGS84] (EGM96 or         |
   |            | better)                                              |

6.2.  Updates to the IETF XML Registry

   This document registers a URI in the "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688].
   Following the format in [RFC3688], the following registration has
   been made:

   URI  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-geo-location

   Registrant Contact  The IESG.

   XML  N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

6.3.  Updates to the YANG Module Names Registry

   This document registers one YANG module in the "YANG Module Names"
   registry [RFC6020].  Following the format in [RFC6020], the following
   registration has been made:

   name  ietf-geo-location

   namespace  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-geo-location

   prefix  geo

   reference  RFC XXXX (RFC Ed.: replace XXXX with RFC number and remove
      this note.)

7.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   Since the modules defined in this document only define groupings,
   these considerations are primarily for the designers of other modules
   that use these groupings.

   All of the data nodes defined in this YANG module are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., "config true", which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   None of the writable/creatable/deletable data nodes in the YANG
   module defined in this document are by themselves considered more
   sensitive or vulnerable then standard configuration.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   Since the grouping defined in this module identifies locations,
   authors using this grouping SHOULD consider any privacy issues that
   may arise when the data is readable.

   This document does not define any RPC actions and hence this section
   does not consider the security of RPCs.
