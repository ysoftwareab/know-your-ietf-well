                    draft-ietf-oauth-device-flow-01

Abstract

   The device flow is suitable for OAuth 2.0 clients executing on
   devices that do not have an easy data-entry method (e.g., game
   consoles, TVs, picture frames, and media hubs), but where the end-
   user has separate access to a user-agent on another computer or
   device (e.g., desktop computer, a laptop, a smart phone, or a
   tablet).

1.  Introduction

   The device flow is suitable for clients executing on devices that do
   not have an easy data-entry method and where the client is incapable
   of receiving incoming requests from the authorization server
   (incapable of acting as an HTTP server).

   Instead of interacting with the end-user's user-agent, the client
   instructs the end-user to use another computer or device and connect
   to the authorization server to approve the access request.  Since the
   client cannot receive incoming requests, it polls the authorization
   server repeatedly until the end-user completes the approval process.

   Note that this device flow does not utilize the client secret.

                          Figure 1: Device Flow.

   The device flow illustrated in Figure 1 includes the following steps:

      (A) The client requests access from the authorization server and
      includes its client identifier in the request.

      (B) The authorization server issues a verification code, an end-
      user code, and provides the end-user verification URI.

      (C) The client instructs the end-user to use its user-agent
      (elsewhere) and visit the provided end-user verification URI.  The
      client provides the end-user with the end-user code to enter in
      order to grant access.

      (D) The authorization server authenticates the end-user (via the
      user-agent) and prompts the end-user to grant the client's access
      request.  If the end-user agrees to the client's access request,
      the end-user enters the end-user code provided by the client.  The
      authorization server validates the end-user code provided by the
      end-user.

      (E) While the end-user authorizes (or denies) the client's request
      (D), the client repeatedly polls the authorization server to find
      out if the end-user completed the end-user authorization step.
      The client includes the verification code and its client
      identifier.

      (F) Assuming the end-user granted access, the authorization server
      validates the verification code provided by the client and
      responds back with the access token.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   Device Endpoint:

      The authorization server's endpoint capable of issuing
      verification codes, user codes, and verification URLs.

   Device Verification Code:

      A short-lived token representing an authorization session.

   End-User Verification Code:

      A short-lived token which the device displays to the end user, is
      entered by the end-user on the authorization sever, and is thus
      used to bind the device to the end-user.

3.  Specification

3.1.  Client Requests Authorization

   The client initiates the flow by requesting a set of verification
   codes from the authorization server by making an HTTP "POST" request
   to the device endpoint.  The client constructs a request URI by
   adding the following parameters to the request:

   response_type:

      REQUIRED.  The parameter value MUST be set to "device_code".

   client_id:





Denniss, et al.         Expires September 4, 2016               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft            OAuth 2.0 Device Flow               March 2016


      REQUIRED.  The client identifier as described in Section 2.2 of
      [RFC6749].

   scope:

      OPTIONAL.  The scope of the access request as described by
      Section 3.3 of [RFC6749].

   For example, the client makes the following HTTPS request (line
   breaks are for display purposes only):

      POST /token HTTP/1.1
      Host: server.example.com
      Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

      response_type=device_code&client_id=s6BhdRkqt3

   In response, the authorization server generates a verification code
   and an end-user code and includes them in the HTTP response body
   using the "application/json" format with a 200 status code (OK).  The
   response contains the following parameters:

   device_code

      REQUIRED.  The verification code.

   user_code

      REQUIRED.  The end-user verification code.

   verification_uri

      REQUIRED.  The end-user verification URI on the authorization
      server.  The URI should be short and easy to remember as end-
      users will be asked to manually type it into their user-agent.

   expires_in

      OPTIONAL.  The duration in seconds of the verification code
      lifetime.

   interval

      OPTIONAL.  The minimum amount of time in seconds that the client
      SHOULD wait between polling requests to the token endpoint.

   For example:

Internet-Draft            OAuth 2.0 Device Flow               March 2016


      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Content-Type: application/json
      Cache-Control: no-store

      {
        "device_code":"74tq5miHKB",
        "user_code":"94248",
        "verification_uri":"http://www.example.com/device",
        "interval"=5
      }

   The client displays the end-user code and the end-user verification
   URI to the end-user, and instructs the end-user to visit the URI
   using a user-agent and enter the end-user code.

   The end-user manually types the provided verification URI and
   authenticates with the authorization server.  The authorization
   server prompts the end-user to authorize the client's request by
   entering the end-user code provided by the client.  Once the end-user
   approves or denies the request, the authorization server informs the
   end-user to return to the device for further instructions.

3.2.  Client Requests Access Token

   Since the client is unable to receive incoming requests from the
   authorization server, it polls the authorization server repeatedly
   until the end-user grants or denies the request, or the verification
   code expires.

   The client makes the following request at an arbitrary but reasonable
   interval which MUST NOT exceed the minimum interval rate provided by
   the authorization server (if present via the "interval" parameter).
   Alternatively, the client MAY provide a user interface for the end-
   user to manually inform it when authorization was granted.

   The client requests an access token by making an HTTP "POST" request
   to the token endpoint as described in Section 4.1.1 of [RFC6749] .
   The "redirect_uri" parameter is NOT REQUIRED as part of this request.

3.3.  Additional Error Responses

   The following error responses are defined in addition to those within
   Section 4.2.2.1. of [RFC6749]:

   authorization_pending






Denniss, et al.         Expires September 4, 2016               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft            OAuth 2.0 Device Flow               March 2016


      The authorization request is still pending as the end-user hasn't
      yet visited the authorization server and entered their
      verification code.

   slow_down

      The client is polling too quickly and should back off at a
      reasonable rate.

4.  Security Considerations

   TBD

Appendix A.  Acknowledgements

   The -00 version of this document was based on draft-recordon-oauth-
   v2-device edited by David Recordon and Brent Goldman.  The content of
   that document was initially part of the OAuth 2.0 protocol
   specification but was later removed due to the lack of sufficient
   deployment expertise at that time.  We would therefore also like to
   thank the OAuth working group for their work on the initial content
   of this specification through 2010.
