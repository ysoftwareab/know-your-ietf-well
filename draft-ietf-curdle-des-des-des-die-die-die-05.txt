              draft-ietf-curdle-des-des-des-die-die-die-05

Abstract

   The 3DES and RC4 encryption types are steadily weakening in
   cryptographic strength, and the deprecation process should be begun
   for their use in Kerberos.  Accordingly, RFC 4757 is moved to
   Historic status, as none of the encryption types it specifies should
   be used, and RFC 3961 is updated to note the deprecation of the
   triple-DES encryption types.

1.  Introduction

   The 3DES and RC4 encryption types are steadily weakening in
   cryptographic strength, and the deprecation process should be begun
   for their use in Kerberos.  Accordingly, RFC 4757 is moved to
   Historic status, as none of the encryption types it specifies should
   be used, and RFC 3961 is updated to note the deprecation of the
   triple-DES encryption types.

2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Affected Specifications

   The RC4 Kerberos encryption types are specified in [RFC4757], which
   is moved to historic.

   The des3-cbc-sha1-kd encryption type is specified in [RFC3961].
   Additional 3DES encryption types are in use with no formal
   specification, in particular des3-cbc-md5 and des3-cbc-sha1.  These
   unspecified encryption types are also deprecated by this document.

   Though the RC4 and 3DES encryption types are still in use in some
   deployments, the above status changes are made to discourage their
   use.

4.  Affected Encryption Types

   The following encryption types are deprecated.  The numbers are the
   official identifiers; the names are only for convenience.

5.  RC4 Weakness

   RC4's weakness as a TLS cipher due to statistical biases in the
   keystream has been well-publicized [RFC7465], and these statistical
   biases cause concern for any consumer of the RC4 cipher.  However,
   the RC4 Kerberos enctypes have additional flaws which reduce the
   security of applications using them, including the weakness of the
   password hashing algorithm, the reuse of key material across
   protocols, and the lack of a salt when hashing the password.

5.1.  Statistical Biases

   The RC4 stream cipher is known to have statistical biases in its
   output, which have led to practical attacks against protocols using
   RC4, such as TLS ([RFC7465]).  At least some of these attacks rely on
   repeated encryptions of thousands of copies of the same plaintext;
   whereas it is easy for malicious javascript in a website to cause
   such traffic, it is unclear that there is an easy way to induce a
   kerberized application to generate such repeated encryptions.  The
   statistical biases are most pronounced for earlier bits in the output
   stream, which is somewhat mitigated by the use of a confounder in
   kerberos messages -- the first 64 bits of plaintext are a random

   confounder, and are thus of no use to an attacker who can retrieve
   them.

   Nonetheless, the statistical biases in the RC4 keystream extend well
   past 64 bits, and provide potential attack surface to an attacker.
   Continuing to use a known weak algorithm is inviting further
   development of attacks.

5.2.  Password Hash

   Kerberos long-term keys can either be random (as might be used in a
   service's keytab) or derived from a password (usable for individual
   users to authenticate to a system).  The specification for a Kerberos
   encryption type must include a "string2key" algorithm for generating
   a raw crypto key from a string (i.e., password).  Modern encryption
   types, such as those using the AES and Camellia block ciphers, use a
   string2key function based on the PBKDF2 algorithm, which involves
   many iterations of a cryptographic hash function, designed to
   increase the computational effort required to perform a brute-force
   password-guessing attack.  There is an additional option to specify
   an increased iteration count for a given principal, providing some
   modicum of adaptability for increases in computing power.

   It is also best practice, when deriving cryptographic secrets from
   user passwords, to include a value which is unique to both the user
   and the realm of authentication as input to the hash function; this
   user-specific input is known as a "salt".  The default salt for
   Kerberos principals includes both the name of the principal and the
   name of the realm, in accordance with these best practices.  However,
   the RC4 encryption types ignore the salt input to the string2key
   function, which is a single iteration of the MD4 hash function
   applied to the UTF-16 encoded password, with no salt at all.  The MD4
   hash function is very old, and is considered to be weak and
   unsuitable for new cryptographic applications at this time.
   [RFC6150]

   The omission of a salt input to the hash is contrary to cryptographic
   best practices, and allows an attacker to construct a "rainbow table"
   of password hashes, which are applicable to all principals in all
   Kerberos realms.  Given the prevalance of poor-quality user-selected
   password, it is likely that a rainbow table derived from a database
   of common passwords would be able to compromise a sizable number of
   Kerberos principals in any realm using RC4 encryption types for
   password-derived keys.

5.3.  Cross-Protocol Key Reuse

   The selection of unsalted MD4 as the Kerberos string2key function was
   deliberate, since it allowed systems to be converted in-place from
   the old NTLM logon protocol [MS-NLMP] to use Kerberos.

   Unfortunately, there still exist systems using NTLM for
   authentication to applications, which can result in application
   servers possessing the NT password hash of user passwords.  Because
   the RC4 string2key was chosen to be compatible with the NTLM scheme,
   these application servers also possess the long-term Kerberos key for
   those users even though the password is unknown.  The cross-protocol
   use of the long-term key/password hash was convenient for migrating
   to Kerberos, but now provides a vulnerability in Kerberos as NTLM
   continues to be used.

5.4.  Interoperability Concerns

   The RC4 Kerberos encryption type remains in use in many environments
   because of interoperability requirements -- in those sites, RC4 is
   the strongest enctype which allows two parties to use Kerberos to
   communicate.  In particular, the Kerberos implementions included with
   Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 support only single-DES and RC4.
   Since single-DES is deprecated ([RFC6649]), machines running those
   operating systems must use RC4.

   Similarly, there are cross-realm deployments where the cross-realm
   key was initially established when one peer only supported RC4, or
   where machines only supporting RC4 will need to obtain a cross-realm
   Ticket-Granting Ticket.  It can be difficult to inventory all clients
   in a Kerberos realm and know what implementations will be used by
   those client principals; this leads to concerns that disabling RC4
   will cause breakage on machines that are unknown to the realm
   administrators.

   Fortunately, modern (i.e., supported) Kerberos implementations
   support a secure alternative to RC4, in the form of AES.  Windows has
   supported AES since 2007-2008 with the release of Windows Vista and
   Server 2008, respectively; MIT Kerberos [MITKRB5] has fully supported
   AES (including the GSSAPI mechanism) since 2004 with the release of
   version 1.3.2; Heimdal [HEIMDAL] has fully supported AES since 2005
   with the release of version 0.7.  Though there may still be issues
   running ten-year-old unsupported software in mixed environments with
   new software, issues of that sort seem unlikely to be unique to
   Kerberos, and the aministrators of such environments are expected to
   be capable of devising workarounds.

6.  3DES Weakness

   The flaws in triple-DES as used for Kerberos are not quite as damning
   as those in RC4, but there is still ample justification for
   deprecating its use.  As is the case for the RC4 enctypes, the
   string2key algorithm is weak.  Additionally, the 3DES encryption
   types were not implemented in all Kerberos implementations, and the
   64-bit block size may be problematic in some environments.

6.1.  Password-based Keys

   The n-fold-based string2key function used by the des3-cbc-sha1-kd
   encryption type is an ad-hoc construction that should not be
   considered cryptographically sound.  It is known to not provide
   effective mixing of the input bits, and is computationally easy to
   evaluate.  As such, it does not slow down brute-force attacks in the
   way that the computationally demanding PBKDF2 algorithm used by more
   modern encryption types does.  The salt is used by des3-cbc-sha1-kd's
   string2key, in contrast to RC4, but a brute-force dictionary attack
   on common passwords may still be feasible.

6.2.  Block Size

   Because triple-DES is based on the single-DES primitive, just using
   additional key material and nested encryption, it inherits the 64-bit
   cipher block size from single-DES.  As a result, an attacker who can
   collect approximately 2**32 blocks of ciphertext has a good chance of
   finding a cipher block collision (the "birthday attack"), which would
   potentially reveal a couple of blocks of plaintext.

   A cipher block collision would not necessarily cause the key itself
   to be leaked, so the plaintext revealed by such a collision would be
   limited.  For some sites, that may be an acceptable risk, but it is
   still considered a weakness in the encryption type.

6.3.  Interoperability

   The triple-DES encryption types were implemented by MIT Kerberos
   early in its development (ca. 1999) and present in the 1.2 release,
   but were superseded when encryption types 17 and 18 (AES) were
   implemented by 2003 and present in the 1.3 release.  The Heimdal
   Kerberos implementation also provided a version of 3DES in 1999
   (though the GSSAPI portions remained non-interoperable with MIT for
   some time after that), and gained support for AES in 2005 with its
   0.7 release.  Both Heimdal and MIT krb5 have supported the AES
   enctypes for some 12 years, and it is expected that deployments that
   support 3DES but not AES are quite rare.

   The Kerberos implementation in Microsoft Windows does not currently
   and has never implemented the 3DES encryption type.  Support for AES
   was introduced with Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008; older
   versions such as Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 only supported
   the RC4 encryption types.

   The 3DES encryption type offers very slow encryption, especially
   compared to the performance of AES using the hardware accelleration
   available in modern CPUs.  There are no areas where it offers
   advantages over other encryption types except in the rare case where
   AES is not available.

7.  Recommendations

   This document hereby removes the following RECOMMENDED types from
   [RFC4120]:

   Encryption:  DES3-CBC-SHA1-KD

   Checksum:  HMAC-SHA1-DES3-KD

   Kerberos implementations and deployments SHOULD NOT implement or
   deploy the following triple-DES encryption types: DES3-CBC-MD5(5),
   DES3-CBC-SHA1(7), and DES3-CBC-SHA1-KD(16) (updates [RFC3961],
   [RFC4120]).

   Kerberos implementations and deployments SHOULD NOT implement or
   deploy the RC4 encryption type RC4-HMAC(23).

   Kerberos implementations and deployments SHOULD NOT implement or
   deploy the following checksum types: RSA-MD5(7), RSA-MD5-DES3(9),
   HMAC-SHA1-DES3-KD(12), and HMAC-SHA1-DES3(13) (updates [RFC3961],
   [RFC4120]).

   Kerberos GSS mechanism implementations and deployments SHOULD NOT
   implement or deploy the following SGN_ALGs: HMAC MD5(1100) and HMAC
   SHA1 DES3 KD (updates [RFC4757]).

   Kerberos GSS mechanism implementations and deployments SHOULD NOT
   implement or deploy the following SEAL_ALGs: RC4(1000) and
   DES3KD(0400).

   This document recommends the reclassification of [RFC4757] as
   Historic.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document is entirely about security considerations, namely that
   the use of the 3DES and RC4 Kerberos encryption types is not secure,
   and they should not be used.

9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to update the registry of Kerberos Encryption Type
   Numbers [IANA-KRB] to note that encryption types 1, 2, 3, and 24 are
   deprecated, with RFC 6649 ([RFC6649]) as the reference, and that
   encryption types 5, 7, 16, and 23 are deprecated, with this document
   as the reference.

   Similarly, IANA is requested to update the registry of Kerberos
   Checksum Type Numbers [IANA-KRB] to note that checksum types 1, 2, 3,
   4, 5, 6, and 8 are deprecated, with RFC 6649 as the reference, and
   that checksum types 7, 12, and 13 are deprecated, with this document
   as the reference.
