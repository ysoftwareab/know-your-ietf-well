Internet-Draft    IANA Considerations for Router Alert      October 2006


1.  Introduction

   The IP Router Alert Option is defined for IPv4 in [RFC2113].  A
   similar IPv6 option is defined in [RFC2711].  When one of these
   options is present in an IP datagram, it indicates that the contents
   of the datagram may be interesting to routers.  The Router Alert
   Option (RAO) is used by protocols such as RSVP [RFC2205] and IGMP
   [RFC3376].

   Both the IPv4 and IPv6 option contain a two octet value field to
   carry extra information.  This information can be used, for example,
   by routers to determine whether or not the packet should be more
   closely examined by them.

   This document proposes the creation of a new IANA registry for
   managing IPv4 Router Alert Option Values.  In conjunction with this,
   it also proposes an update to the way in which IPv6 Router Alert
   Option Values are assigned in the existing IANA registry.


2.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Use of the Router Alert Option Value Field

   One difference betwen the specifications for the IPv4 and IPv6 Router
   Alert Options is the way in which values for the value field are
   managed.

   In [RFC2113], the IPv4 Router Alert Option value field has the value
   0 assigned to "Router shall examine packet".  All other values
   (1-65535) are reserved.  No mechanism is provided for the allocation
   of these values by IANA.

   The IPv6 Router Alert Option has an IANA managed registry
   [IANA-IPv6RAO] containing allocations for the value field.  All
   values in this registry are assigned by IETF consensus.

   In [RFC3175] the IPv4 Router Alert Option Value is described as a
   parameter which provides "additional information" to the router in
   making its interception decision, rather than as a registry managed
   by IANA.  As such, this aggregation mechanism makes use of the value
   field to carry the reservation aggregation level.  For the IPv6
   option, this document requests a set of 32 values to be assigned by

   IANA for indicating reservation levels.  However, since other
   registrations had already been made in that registry these values are
   from 3-35 (which is actually a set of 33 values).

   Although it would be strongly desirable to have the same values being
   used in both the IPv4 and IPv6 registries, the initial allocations in
   [RFC2711] and the aggregation level allocations in [RFC3175] have
   made this impossible.  The following table shows the allocations in
   the IPv6 registry and values used in the IPv4 registry, where the
   latter have been deduced from [RFC2113] and [RFC3175] with the
   assumption that the number of aggregation levels can be limited to 32
   as in the IPv6 case.  Entries for values 6 to 31 have been elided for
   brevity.

   | 36-65534 | Reserved                | Reserved to IANA for future  |
   |          |                         | use                          |

   +----------+-------------------------+------------------------------+

   The entry in the above table for the IPv6 RAO Value of 32 has been
   marked with a question mark due to an inconsistency in the text of
   [RFC3175], which is consequently reflected in the IANA registry.  In
   that document the values 3-35 (i.e. 33 values) are defined for
   nesting levels 0-31 (i.e. 32 levels).

   It is unclear why nesting levels begin at 1 for IPv4 (described in
   section 1.4.9 of [RFC3175]) and 0 for IPv6 (allocated in section 6 of
   [RFC3175]).

   Although it is not possible to remedy the past inconsistency between
   the two sets of allocations, it is still preferable that future
   allocations should be made identically in both registries.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This section contains the proposed new procedures for managing Router
   Alert Option Values.  This requires the creation of a registry for
   IPv4 Router Alert Option Values (described in Section 4.1) and
   changes to the way in which IPv6 Router Alert Option Values are
   managed (described in Section 4.2).

4.1.  IANA Considerations for IPv4 Router Alert Option Values

   The value field, as specified in [RFC2113] is two octets in length.
   The value field is registered and maintained by IANA.  The initial
   contents of this registry are:

   +----------+--------------------------------------------+-----------+
   | Value    | Description                                | Reference |
   +----------+--------------------------------------------+-----------+
   | 0        | Router shall examine packet                | [RFC2119] |
   | 1-32     | Aggregated Reservation Nesting Level       | [RFC3175] |
   | 33-35    | Reserved (not to be allocated) - Note:     |           |
   |          | These values are allocated in the IPv6     |           |
   |          | Router Alert Option Values registry        |           |
   | 36-65534 | Reserved to IANA for future use            |           |
   | 65535    | Reserved                                   |           |
   +----------+--------------------------------------------+-----------+

   New values are to be assigned via IETF Consensus as defined in
   [RFC2434].  When a new allocation is made in this registry an

Internet-Draft    IANA Considerations for Router Alert      October 2006


   identical registration MUST be made in the IPv6 Router Alert Option
   Values registry, or that value MUST be reserved.  In the case that it
   is reserved rather than allocated, the registry entry should say
   "Reserved (not to be allocated) - Note: This value is allocated in
   the IPv6 Router Alert Options registry".

4.2.  IANA Considerations for IPv6 Router Alert Option Values

   The registry for IPv6 Router Alert Option Values should continue to
   be maintained as specified in [RFC2711].  However, when a new
   allocation is made in this registry an identical registration MUST be
   made in the IPv4 Router Alert Option Values registry, or that value
   MUST be reserved.  In the case that it is reserved rather than
   allocated, the registry entry should say "Reserved (not to be
   allocated) - Note: This value is allocated in the IPv4 Router Alert
   Options registry".


5.  Alternative Proposals

   In Section 4 this document describes one way of modifying the Router
   Alert Option registry management, but this is not necessarily the
   only solution.

   One question that arises is what the intended status of this document
   should be.  Currently this document is aimed as a standards track
   document, that modifies [RFC2113] and [RFC2711].  It is not clear
   whether this is the right option.  A draft aimed at becoming a BCP
   might be an alternative.

   This document currently proposes the use of separate registries for
   IPv4 and IPv6 Router Alert Options, but with coordinated management
   of future allocations.  This is mainly because of the differences in
   the existing allocation, e.g. for the 0 codepoint.  An alternative
   proposal would be to use a single combined registry.

   It might also be desirable to align the Aggregated Reservation
   Nesting Levels, as defined in [RFC3175], for IPv4 and IPv6.
   Aggregated Nesting Level 1 for IPv4 would then need to move to using
   the codepoint 4, as in the IPv6 case.  However, such a change may not
   be possible.


6.  Security Considerations

   Since this document is only concerned with the IANA management of the
   IPv4 Router Alert Option values registry it raises no new security
   issues beyond those identified in [RFC2113] and [RFC2711].
