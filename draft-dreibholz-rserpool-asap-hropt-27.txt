1.  Introduction

   Reliable Server Pooling defines protocols for providing highly
   available services.  The Aggregate Server Access Protocol (ASAP)
   provides session management and server selection for applications.
   Upon request for a server selection -- denoted as handle resolution
   -- an ENRP server returns a list of selected PE identities.  The
   number of PE identities to be returned is not specified by RSerPool.
   Furthermore the ASAP protocol does not contain a way for letting the
   requesting instance specify it.

   As shown in [Dre2006], [IJAIT2009], [IJHIT2008], selecting too many
   entries does not make sense for the application, but on the other
   hand also result in significant processing and network overhead.
   Furthermore, it has been shown in [LCN2005] that the number of
   requested elements is usually 1, but there are application cases
   where more PE identities have to be returned.  That is, there should
   be a possibility to specify the number of requested PE items upon a
   handle resolution.

1.1.  Scope

   The Handle Resolution option defined in this draft simply defines an
   option to let the PU-side specify the desired number of PE identities
   from the ENRP server.

1.2.  Terminology

   The terms are commonly identified in related work and can be found in
   the Aggregate Server Access Protocol and Endpoint Handlespace
   Redundancy Protocol Common Parameters document RFC 5354 [RFC5354].

1.3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Handle Resolution Option

2.1.  Definition

   The Handle Resolution MAY be used once in an ASAP Handle Resolution
   message sent from a PU to an ENRP server.  It is defined as follows.

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |        Type = 0x803f         |            Length=8            |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                             Items                             |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Items: 32 bits (unsigned integer)

   Contains the number of PE identities to be selected by the ENRP
   server.  Setting it to 0xffffffff denotes to obtain as many PE
   identities as possible.  A setting of 0 denotes to use the ENRP
   server's default value; this default MUST be used if there is no
   Handle Resolution option given.  The ENRP server SHOULD try to fulfil
   the request for the given number of items.

   Note, that the high-order bits of the type field are set to 10, which
   means "skip this parameter and continue processing" if this parameter
   type is not supported by the ENRP server.  This allows for
   interoperability with old implementations.

3.  Reference Implementation

   The RSerPool reference implementation RSPLIB can be found at
   [RSerPool-Website].  It supports the functionalities defined by
   [RFC5351], [RFC5352], [RFC5353], [RFC5354] and [RFC5356] as well as
   the options [I-D.dreibholz-rserpool-delay],
   [I-D.dreibholz-rserpool-enrp-takeover] and of course the option

   defined by this document.  An introduction to this implementation is
   provided in [Dre2006].

4.  Testbed Platform

   A large-scale and realistic Internet testbed platform with support
   for the multi-homing feature of the underlying SCTP protocol is
   NorNet.  A description of NorNet is provided in [PAMS2013-NorNet],
   some further information can be found on the project website
   [NorNet-Website].

5.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for RSerPool systems are described by
   [RFC5355].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require additional IANA actions beyond those
   already identified in the ENRP and ASAP protocol specifications.

   Kohnen, Jobin Pulinthanath and Xing Zhou for their support.
