            Abstract 
             
            The need to support L2VPN services with disparate Attachment Circuits 
            (heterogeneous transport) is becoming as important as the support of 
            L2VPN services with the same type of Attachment Circuits (homogenous 
            transport). To support L2VPN services with heterogeneous transport, 
            some means of interworking is needed.  The requirement to support L2VPN 
            interworking is stated in [PPVPN-L2FRWK]. This document describes 
            different approaches and mechanisms that can be used to provide L2VPN 
            interworking among disparate interfaces.

            WHY IS IT TARGETED AT THIS WG 
             
            This document describes different interworking approaches and 
            mechanisms for Provider Provisioned L2VPN. 
             
            JUSTIFICATION 
             
            This document addresses interworking between disparate interfaces for 
            L2VPN whose requirements are also stated in [PPVPN-FRWK]. 
             
          2. Introduction 
             
            The advantages of providing different types of L2 circuits (e.g. ATM, 
            FR, Ethernet, and so on) over a common infrastructure (either IP or 
            MPLS) are well understood and are described in [PWE3-FRWK] and [PPVPN-
            L2FRWK]. The primary focus in both frameworks has been the support of 
            like-to-like services (e.g. the same type of ACs at both ends of a 
            Pseudo-Wire). The importance of supporting disparate ACs (heterogeneous 
            transport) is becoming more evident. For example, as VPN users expand 
            their L2VPNs over MPLS or IP, they wish to leverage their existing CE 
            devices that may have legacy interfaces such as ATM or Frame-relay, and 
            they would like to be able to add new CE devices with FE or GE 
            interfaces to their L2VPN. This means that Service Providers not only 
            need to provide L2VPN services (such as VPWS and VPLS) to customers 
            with uniform ACs but they also need to provide these services to 
            customers with disparate ACs. To support L2VPN services with 
            heterogeneous transport, some means of interworking is clearly needed.  
            The requirement to support L2VPN interworking is stated in [PPVPN-
            L2FRWK].  
             
            This document covers different approaches to facilitate this 
            interworking and presents some mechanisms that can be used to provide 
            L2VPN interworking among disparate interfaces depending on the intended

            L2 service. Based on the application, a given approach/mechanism may be 
            better suited than others as will be described in this document. This 
            document primarily focuses on interworking in the data-plane. Control-
            plane interworking (signaling/routing between different protocols) is 
            outside the scope of this document.  
             
          2.1. Interworking Reference Model 
           
            Figure 1 below shows the network reference model used for L2VPN 
            Interworking. This model is the same as the one described in [PWE3-
            FRWK], with the exception that the Native Service (NS) that is carried 
            across the AC, has been added to the model.

                 Figure 1: L2VPN Interworking Network Reference Model 
             
            CE, PE, Pseudo-wire, and PSN tunnel are as defined in [PWE3-FRWK] and 
            the Attachment Circuits (ACs) are as defined in [PPVPN-FRWK]. 
             
            In the context of L2VPN Interworking, we define the Native Service as 
            the common end-to-end service that is carried over the ACs between the 
            two CEs.  
             
            With respect to L2VPN Interworking, it is important to differentiate 
            between an AC and the Native Service (NS) that runs over that AC. The 
            AC is a physical or virtual circuit connection between a CE and a PE. 
            However, the Native Service in this reference model is the common L2 
            application service that runs between a pair of CEs and is carried over

            the two disparate ACs. For example, an AC between a CE and a PE can be 
            ATM or FR but the Native Service can be Ethernet (EoATM, EoFR). 
            Sometimes, the AC and the NS are of the same type (e.g., both are of 
            type Ethernet), in which case it simplifies the interworking task on 
            the corresponding PE. 
             
          3. General Approaches 
             
            There are two general approaches for interworking ˚ the first is to 
            extend the AC from one side of the connection to the other side and 
            perform the interworking only on one side (on one PE). The second 
            approach is to terminate each AC locally and to transport the NS frames 
            across the network. In the first approach, the PW type is the same as 
            the AC that gets extended over the network; whereas, in the later 
            approach, the PW type is independent of the AC type and instead it is 
            of the same type as the NS. If the NS is the same as one of the ACs, 
            then local interworking is not required for that PE (whose AC is the 
            same as the NS) and the two approaches become the same. 
             
            The following figure depicts the interworking model for the extended AC 
            approach. In this figure, the AC between CE2 and the PE2 (AC2) is 
            extended over the network to PE1 (through the use of AC2-over-PW), and 
            the Interworking Function (IWF) between the two disparate ACs is 
            performed in PE1. In this interworking model, PE2 is completely 
            oblivious to the NS and only deals with processing the frames from AC2 
            (e.g. NS frames pass transparently through PE2). For example, consider 
            AC1 and AC2 are of type FR and PPP respectively. In this scenario, the 
            PPP frames are carried over the network using PPPoPW to PE1 and PE1 
            performs the Interworking. PE2 is unaware of this interworking 
            functionality and operates as if AC1 is also of type PPP. However, a 
            certain amount of burden is placed on PE1, as it needs to perform 
            complete interworking functionality, including the termination of the 
            PPP sessions even though PE1 may not have any local PPP interfaces.

            Figure 3 depicts the interworking model for local termination of ACs. 
            In this model each PE terminates its corresponding AC and after 
            extracting the NS frames, it transports them to the other side using 
            the PW that is of the same type as the NS (NSoPW). If we consider the 
            previous example where AC1 and AC2 are of type FR and PPP respectively, 
            PE1 terminates the FR VC using [RFC2427] and transports the NS frames 
            (e.g., IP packets in this example) to the other side using IPoPW. At 
            the egress PE2, the IP packets are encapsulated using [RFC1661] and are 
            sent over the PPP AC.

            The advantage of the Extended-AC interworking approach is that one of 
            the existing PW types is used for carrying the frames from one side of 
            the connection to the other. Furthermore, in the case of ATM-FR 
            interworking, a well-defined Service Interworking function is used for 
            the interoperability between the two disparate ACs. However, in general 
            the disadvantages of this approach can outweigh the advantages since 
            there is more overhead associated with this approach.  
             
            In comparison, there are several advantages to the Local-AC-Termination 
            interworking approach: 
             
                * Each PE is only required to support the interworking for the 
                  interfaces that it supports. For example, a PE with ATM 
                  interfaces is only required to support [RFC2684] and not 
                  [RFC2427], [RFC 1661], or other functionality that is not 
                  pertinent to that interface. 
             
                * Each PE is only required to support a common PW for its 
                  interworking. For example, a PE with ATM interfaces that needs 
                  to do Ethernet encapsulation over its ATM interface is only 
                  required to support a single common PW that carries the Ethernet 
                  payload. This means that the ATM PE need not terminate different 
                  types of PW such as PPP, HDLC, FR, and so on, and be required to 
                  run different procedures such as [RFC2427], [RFC1661], 
                  [RFC2878], etc. to extract the Ethernet payload from these PWs. 
             
                * Configuration of each interface or VC type is limited to the PE 
                  that supports that interface. 
                 
                * Better scalability. Since each PE terminates the ACs locally and 
                  performs the corresponding interworking to/from a common PW 
                  locally, the interworking task is load balanced across the two 
                  legs of the connection and thus better system scalability is 
                  achieved. 
             
            Because of the above advantages of the Local-AC-Termination approach 
            over the Extended-AC, it is recommended as the preferred approach for 
            interworking between disparate ACs.

            The Local-AC-Termination approach can be considered as a subset of the 
            service-interworking function, which is optimized for Ethernet, PPP, 
            and IP services (specifically this is true for ATM-FR service 
            interworking). However, in the case of ATM-FR interworking where full 
            service-interworking functionality is required and the approximation is 
            not sufficient, one may have to use the Extended-AC approach and 
            perform the IWF (e.g., FRF.8.1) at a single PE.  
             
          4. Interworking Mechanisms 
             
            In general, there are four main NS types ˚ namely: 
              
                * Ethernet  
                * IP  
                * PPP  
                * Multiprotocol 
                
            In the following, we define four interworking mechanisms corresponding 
            to these four service types. 
             
            As discussed previously, in the Local-AC-Termination interworking 
            approach, the PW type is the same as the NS type. This means that if 
            there are four NS types, then there need to be four PW types to 
            transport the corresponding NS frames. The PW type and encapsulation to 
            carry Ethernet and PPP frames have already been defined for both MPLS 
            and IP; however, new Pseudowire types for IP & Multiprotocol PDUs needs 
            to be defined. 
             
            In some interworking scenarios as described later, there may be a need 
            to carry both Ethernet and IP services simultaneously over a single AC 
            between the CE and its corresponding PE. There may also be a need to 
            carry several different L3 protocols over the same AC. In such cases, a 
            new Multi-Protocol (MP) Pseudowire is needed to carry these different 
            multiple protocols simultaneously.  
             
            The following sub-sections describe each of the above interworking 
            mechanisms (Ethernet, IP, PPP, and MP) and their corresponding 
            applications in greater details. 
           
             
          4.1. Interworking w/ Ethernet Encapsulation 
               
            Ethernet encapsulation is the only interworking mechanism that is 
            applicable to both VPWS and VPLS services. The other interworking 
            mechanisms are only applicable to VPWS service. One of the most common 
           
          Sajassi, et al        Expires October 2003           [Page 7]

            applications for Ethernet encapsulation is to provide ubiquitous 
            Ethernet service across different customer sites and over different AC 
            types so that IGP routing protocols such as OSPF, RIP, and IS-IS can 
            run among customer CE routers without the need for any special 
            procedures in the Service Provider∆s PEs. 
             
            Some of the procedures used in IGP routing protocols depend on the 
            underlying L2 protocol and these procedures are different for a point-
            to-point connection (e.g., an ATM VC) versus a multi-access connection 
            (e.g., Ethernet). Therefore, it cannot be expected that these protocols 
            will operate correctly between two CEs with disparate ACs, without some 
            special procedures to accommodate such heterogeneous transport. The use 
            of Ethernet encapsulation provides homogenous Ethernet connectivity 
            end-to-end among CEs and thus simplifies the operation of the routing 
            protocols over disparate ACs to a uniform L2 media access.  
             
            If the AC is of type Ethernet (e.g., AC and NS are of the same type), 
            then no Interworking Function is needed on that PE and Ethernet frames 
            are transported over the PW (which is of type Ethernet [PWE3-ETH-
            ENCP]). However, if Ethernet frames are carried over a non-Ethernet AC 
            (e.g., ATM, FR, PPP), then the task of IWF on that PE is to terminate 
            the AC based on already defined RFC procedures, and extract the 
            Ethernet frames and transport them over the Ethernet PW. If the AC is 
            of type ATM, FR, or PPP, then [RFC2684], [RFC2427], or [RFC2878] are 
            used respectively for encapsulation/de-encapsulation of the Ethernet 
            frames.   
             
            In this interworking scenario, the non-Ethernet ACs of the CE routers 
            need to be configured to use Ethernet encapsulation. There are 
            currently two common ways of configuring the CE routers for such 
            operations and they are: 
             
                * Configure the CE router interface as a bridged interface  
                * Configure the CE router interface as a routed interface with 
                  bridged encapsulation 
             
            The first method requires that the CE router interface be configured 
            for bridging operation, and be connected to routed interfaces by way of 
            a virtual interface. Routed packets for a given protocol can be 
            exchanged between routed and bridged interfaces via this virtual 
            interface. This virtual interface acts like a normal routed interface 
            and represents the corresponding bridge group to routed interfaces 
            within the CE router. 
            The second method requires that the CE interface be configured for 
            routed operation, but provide bridged encapsulation via the interface. 
            Using this method, the interface looks and behaves like a routed

          Internet Draft    draft-sajassi-l2vpn-interworking-01.txt    November 2002 
             
            interface to all other routed interfaces although packets that are sent 
            out of this interface are encapsulated in a bridged format. In the case 
            of an ATM/FR interface, this would require specific IGP configuration 
            to force the router to see the interface as multi-access.  
             
            The interworking with Ethernet encapsulation also simplifies the job of 
            PE devices and the IWF on the PEs is limited to the termination of the 
            ACs and encapsulation/de-encapsulation of Ethernet frames based on 
            already defined RFC mechanisms such as [RFC2684], [RFC2427], and 
            [RFC2878]. No additional procedures such as ARP mediation [ARP-
            Mediation] are required.   
             
            The following table lists all possible combinations of ACs that can 
            exist for interworking w/ Ethernet encapsulation and the applicable RFC 
            procedures that need to be performed by IWF.

          4.1.1. BPDUs processing 
             
            In most applications where CEs with non-Ethernet interfaces are either 
            routers or hosts, there is no need to handle BPDUs at the PEs and 
            therefore they can be dropped. This can occur either at the Ethernet PE 
            (when the BPDU first comes over the Ethernet AC) or at the ATM/FR/PPP 
            PE before being delivered over the non-Ethernet AC. However, in 
            applications where the non-Ethernet AC on a CE router is configured as 
            a bridged interface, then BPDUs need to be properly encapsulated/de-
            encapsulated by the corresponding PE and sent/received over the non-
            Ethernet AC. 
             
             
          4.2. Interworking w/ IP Encapsulation 
             
            IP encapsulation is used in applications where IP routing among 
            different customer sites is desired. In such cases, the Service 
           
          Sajassi, et al        Expires October 2003           [Page 9] 
           
             
          Internet Draft    draft-sajassi-l2vpn-interworking-01.txt    November 2002 
             
            Provider doesn∆t participate in the customer∆s layer-3 network, but 
            simply provides a L2 circuit over which L3 PDUs may be carried.  
             
            However, due to the disparate ACs at both ends of the PW, certain 
            issues may arise with the routing protocol such as the mismatch of 
            procedures for point-to-point and multi-access media, and this may 
            necessitate configuration changes at the CE. Such configuration changes 
            may not be available for all routing protocols and in such cases, the 
            Ethernet encapsulation method described earlier may be used. 
             
            Although the overhead of IP encapsulation on the CEs may be relatively 
            small (e.g., no configurations changes where both ACs are PtP, no 
            requirement for routed/bridged interaction and so on), the overhead on 
            the PEs is more significant as they need to provide mediation between 
            different address resolution mechanisms (such as ARP and InARP) 
            corresponding to the disparate interfaces.  In some cases where an ATM 
            or FR AC is configured as point-to-point or with static IP/circuit 
            mapping (instead of a multi-access interface), this mediation is not 
            required at the FR/ATM side of the PW. 
             
            [ARP-Mediation] describes a three-step process for performing this 
            mediation function for IP only protocols. The three steps are: 
             
               1. The PE discovers the attached CEs IP address 
               2. The PE distributes the CEs IP address to a remote PE  
               3. The remote PE notifies its attached CE about the far-end CE∆s IP 
                 address 
             
            If one of the ACs is of type Ethernet, then the corresponding PE also 
            needs to learn the MAC address of that CE. 
             
            Based on the AC type, there are several different ways of discovering 
            the attached CE∆s IP address and as the result, there are different 
            special cases that need to be handled. For example, if the AC is 
            Ethernet, in order to learn the IP address of the attached CE, the PE 
            device must execute a router discovery protocol or it must glean source 
            address fields from any broadcast messages, or it must wait for the CE 
            to generate an ARP request. The PE also needs to have a mechanism to 
            verify the existence of the CE∆s IP address and it∆s binding to the MAC 
            address, and to resolve situations where more than one IP address is 
            received over the Ethernet AC. The handling for some of these special 
            cases is described in the [ARP-Mediation] draft. 
             
            The following table lists all the possible combinations of ACs that can 
            exist for interworking w/ IP encapsulation and the applicable RFC 
            procedures that need to be performed by IWF.

            In all these scenarios, the Local-AC-Termination approach is used and 
            after terminating the local AC in the IWF, the L3 PDU is extracted and 
            transported over the PW. 
             
            In the case of IP encapsulation where one AC is ATM or FR, then the 
            ATM/FR AC may be configured for point-to-point operation, or the 
            circuit-to-IP mapping may be set manually. In this case, Inverse-ARP is 
            not required at the FR or ATM end of the circuit. In such scenarios, 
            the procedure for ARP mediation can be simplified considerably, and ARP 
            proxy may be used at the Ethernet AC side of the circuit. In this case, 
            the PE with the Ethernet AC only need to respond to ARP requests using 
            its own MAC address and there is no need to exchange the CEs∆ IP 
            addresses between the two PEs over the network.   
           
             
          4.3. Interworking w/ PPP Encapsulation 
             
            This type of Interworking may be used for applications that desire an 
            end-to-end PPP connection between a pair of CEs. An example of such an 
            application is where a CE with a low speed (e.g., T1/E1) ATM/FR 
            interface on one side of the PW (e.g., access GWs) needs to carry 
            compressed voice (using cRTP) to a Trunking-GW CE with an Ethernet 
            interface. Such applications require end-to-end PPP connections between 
            the access-GW CEs and the trunking-GW CEs. Also for applications where 
            L3 protocol transparency is needed or peer-to-peer authentication 
            between the CEs is needed, then PPP interworking can come in handy. 
             
            The impact of the PPP Interworking on CE and PE devices are as follow. 
            If the CE is a router, then it shall support PPP protocol and it needs 
            to terminate both PPP session and the AC; however, if the CE is an 
            Ethernet switch/bridge, then the PPP frames are carried transparently 
            over Ethernet/VLAN (PPPoE) and the PPP session is terminated at a far-

            end host/router. Therefore, the support for PPP protocol on the CE is 
            not always needed and it depends on the application. 
             
            If the PE needs to support PPP sessions over an Ethernet interface 
            (e.g., PPPoE), then the PE needs to perform session negotiation 
            therefore it needs to run PPPoE software. However, if the PE needs to 
            support PPP sessions over an ATM interface (e.g., PPPoA), then no 
            session negotiation is required. 
              
            The following table lists all possible pair of ACs that can exist for 
            interworking w/ PPP encapsulation and the applicable RFC procedures 
            that need to be performed by IWF.  
             
             +---+-----------+------------+--------------+-------------+ 
             |   | AC-1      |    AC-2    |    IWF-1     |   IWF-2     | 
             +---+-----------+------------+--------------+-------------+ 
             | 1 | Ethernet  |   ATM      |   RFC 2516   |  RFC 2364   | 
             | 2 | Ethernet  |   FR       |   RFC 2516   |  RFC 1973   | 
             | 3 | Ethernet  |   PPP/HDLC |   RFC 2516   |  NULL       | 
             | 4 | FR        |   ATM      |   RFC 1973   |  RFC 2364   | 
             | 5 | FR        |   PPP/HDLC |   RFC 1973   |  NULL       | 
             | 6 | ATM       |   PPP/HDLC |   RFC 2364   |  NULL       | 
             +---+-----------+------------+--------------+-------------+ 
             
             
            In scenarios 3, 5, and 6 of the previous table, the AC at one side is 
            the same type as the NS (both are PPP) and as mentioned earlier this 
            would result in simplification of the IWF to NULL for that side. Also 
            as mentioned previously, for such scenarios the Local-AC-termination 
            and Extended-AC approaches map into the same thing. However, in 
            scenarios 1, 2, and 4, each side terminates its local AC based on the 
            corresponding RFC and after extraction of the PPP frames, transports 
            them over the PW using [PWE3-PPP]. 
             
             
          4.4. Interworking w/ Multi-Protocol Encapsulation 
             
            In applications where several different protocol types need to be 
            supported over the same AC simultaneously, the interworking w/ Multi-
            Protocol encapsulation can be used. An example of this application is 
            where several different protocols (such as IP, IPX, AppleTalk, and so 
            on), run between a pair of CEs with different AC types, and all of 
            these protocols need to be transported over a single AC. In such a 
            scenario, the end-user may want to configure its CEs to run IP as 
            routed encapsulation and all other non-IP traffic as bridged

            encapsulation. This would require that the PW be able to transport both 
            routed and bridged encapsulated packets over the same AC.  
             
            Alternatively, the end-user may want to route all of these protocols 
            across the same AC, and this would require the PW to be able to carry 
            multiple L3 protocols simultaneously.  
             
            Given that some of the routing protocols such as OSPF and IS-IS have 
            dependencies on the underlying L2 circuit type (e.g., PtP versus multi-
            access link), one cannot assume that the MP PW can work with all 
            different AC types. Therefore, the combination of IP and Ethernet is 
            considered first and any other non-IP routing protocol that needs to be 
            transported over the MP PW should be considered on a case-by-case 
            basis.  
             
            If MP applications need to be supported then as with other interworking 
            mechanisms, the Local-AC-Termination approach should be used, and all 
            packets should be transported over the network using the Multiprotocol 
            (MP) PW that will be described in the next section.  
             
            The support of MP PW imposes additional work on the PE, as it is 
            required to select the proper PW or AC encapsulation on a packet-by-
            packet basis. The advantages of using the MP PW as opposed to extending 
            one of the AC and performing the service interworking on one side are 
            the same as the ones listed for the Local-AC-Termination approach. 
            Primarily by using a MP PW, a common mechanism for Multiprotocol 
            encapsulation is used across different types of ACs. 
              
             
             
          4.5. IP and MP Pseudowire types 
             
            In the previous sections, four interworking mechanisms and their 
            corresponding PW types were discussed. Ethernet and PPP PWs have 
            currently been defined for MPLS and IP networks in [PWE3-Ethernet] and 
            [PWE3-PPP] respectively. In this section we define the format for two 
            new PW types for IP and MP encapsulation. 
             
            We first define two new VC types as follow: 
             
               VC Type  Description  
               0x000C   IP transport  
               0x000D   Multiprotocol transport  
             
            These VC types are signaled between the PEs using directed LDP for MPLS 
            or L2TPv3 for IP networks.

            For the IP PW type, the payload field of the PW contains the IP PDU 
            including the IP header. When the IP PW is setup, only IP packets get 
            transported over this PW and non-IP packets will be discarded. However, 
            for the MP PW type, the payload field of the PW contains a shim header 
            of four octets as shown below to identify the Multiprotocol PDU type. 
             
             
                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2

                |            Reserved         |          Protocol Type        | 
                +-------------------------------------------------------------+ 
                |                                                             | 
                |                                                             | 
                |                  Layer-3 Packet Data Unit                   | 
                |                                                             | 
                |                                                             | 
                +-------------------------------------------------------------+ 
             
            The protocol type field is borrowed from GRE [RFC 2784] and it is a 
            two-byte field that can be used to identify all relevant protocols. 
            When the MP PW is setup, the ingress PE after terminating the 
            corresponding AC, examines the protocol type of each packet and uses 
            the corresponding Protocol Type for the shim header in the payload 
            field of the PW. The egress PE uses the Protocol Type of the shim 
            header to do proper encapsulation over the corresponding AC. If the 
            ingress PE receives a packet for which the corresponding Pseudowire 
            Protocol Type (in the shim header) is not defined, then it should 
            discard the packet. 
             
            The Interworking w/ multi-protocol encapsulation can also be supported 
            using a set of individual PWs instead of MP PW. This is analogous to 
            ATM multi-protocol encapsulation using VC Muxed as opposed to LLC SNAP. 
            For example, if an AC carries both IP and non-IP traffic, then IP 
            traffic can be transported using IP PW and non-IP traffic can be 
            transported using Ethernet PW. The advantage of this approach besides 
            having less payload overheads is that on the egress PE, proper 
            encapsulation of the frames can be performed based on the receiving PW 
            type without looking inside the payload (e.g., without looking at the 
            protocol type). The disadvantage of this approach is that multiple PWs 
            need to be setup ahead of time.  
             
          5. ATM/FR Service Interworking 
           
            [FRF.8.1] is the standard for service interworking between ATM and FR 
            PVCs. It assumes that the ATM service user (e.g., ATM CE) performs no 
           
          Sajassi, et al        Expires October 2003           [Page 14] 
           
             
          Internet Draft    draft-sajassi-l2vpn-interworking-01.txt    November 2002 
             
            frame relaying service-specific functions, and the frame relaying 
            service user (e.g., FR CE) performs no ATM service specific functions. 
            [FRF.8.1] deals with more than just upper layer protocol encapsulation. 
            It deals with traffic management, PVC management, and congestion 
            management interworking. It also supports a suite of routing and bridge 
            protocols.  
             
            To support this interworking, the Extended-AC approach is used where 
            either the FR or the ATM AC is extended to the other side (through the 
            use of FRoPW or ATMoPW) and the interworking function is performed only 
            in one PE. However, if the protocols on the CEs can be limited to IP 
            and Ethernet, then Local-AC-Termination approach can be used which 
            provides the advantages mentioned previously (the PW is of type MP in 
            this case). 
             
            As MP approach is extended to support additional routed and bridged 
            protocols, it can get closer to [FRF.8.1] functionality. 
           
             
          6. Interworking between L2 and L3 VPN 
           
            There are scenarios where a service provider needs to provide VPLS 
            service to a customer, which has sites with different AC types ˚ e.g., 
            some sites with ATM ACs, some sites with FR ACs and many sites with 
            Ethernet ACs. One easy way for the service provider to deliver such 
            service is to mandate that the NS be of type Ethernet end-to-end as 
            discussed previously. In other words, the customer∆s CEs with ATM or FR 
            ACs need to be configured for bridged encapsulation (by configuring its 
            AC as a bridged interface or as routed interface with bridged 
            encapsulation ˚ refer to section 4.1). However, what if the customer∆s 
            CEs don∆t have such capability and cannot be configured easily for such 
            operation or the SP want to offer the service without requiring 
            configuration changes to its customers∆ CEs.  
             
            In such scenarios, the SP can offer L3VPN service toward the customer∆s 
            CEs with routed interfaces and can offer VPLS service toward the CEs 
            with Ethernet interfaces and provide interworking between them. The 
            interworking between L3VPN and VPLS is achieved by having VSI (Virtual 
            Switch Instance) not only on the PEs providing VPLS functionality but 
            also on the PEs providing L3VPN functionality. The VSI interfaces with 
            the L3VPN forwarder (e.g., VRF as defined in [RFC2547]) through 
            provider∆s VLAN (P-VLAN). Each VPLS instance at a PE can be locally 
            represented by a P-VLAN and this P-VLAN can be viewed as a routed 
            interface with respect to the customer L3VPN VRF. Furthermore, the 
            interface between the customer∆s VRF and its corresponding VPLS is 
            through this P-VLAN interface.

            It should be noted that such interworking model is viable when a 
            customer has only a few sites with routed interfaces and majority of 
            his sites have Ethernet/bridged-encapsulation interfaces. If converse 
            is true, then the customer might be better off with pure L3VPN service 
            [RFC2547], instead of a hybrid of VPLS and L3VPN.

            Figure 4 depicts the interworking between VPLS and L3VPN. The figure 
            shows a SP network providing VPN service to a customer with three 
            sites/CEs. Site-1/CE1 is connected via ATM routed interface; whereas, 
            CE2 and CE3 have Ethernet interfaces. The SP is providing VPLS service 
            to CE2 and CE3, and L3VPN service to CE3. The VRF at the PE1 can be 
            viewed as a virtual router peering with CE1 at one end and with CE2 and 
            CE3 at the other end. The collection of VSIs and PWs connecting them 
            together can be viewed as a logical LAN segment between the VRF, CE2, 
            and CE3. Since the VRF is peering with CE1, CE2, and CE3, it is 
            involved in the ARP and the required routing protocol with these CEs.

            As it can be recalled from previous sections, the interworking with 
            Ethernet encapsulation did require configuration changes to CEs and the 
            interworking with IP encapsulation required not only required 
            configuration changes to CEs but also it posed some restrictions on the 
            type of L3 routing protocols that could be run (it was also limited to 
            VPWS services only). However, the primary advantage of this L2/L3 
            interworking mechanism is that it removes the shortcomings of the other 
            interworking mechanisms such that it requires no configuration changes 
            at the customer∆s CEs and there are no restrictions on the type of L3 
            routing protocols that can be run on the CEs. However, the cost of this 
            interworking mechanism is for the PEs (with non-Ethernet ACs) to 
            provide the L3VPN service in addition to the VPLS service. 
             
           
             
          7. Security Considerations 
              
            The security aspects of this solution will be discussed at a later 
            time.
