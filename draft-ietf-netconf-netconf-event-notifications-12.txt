1.  Introduction

   This document provides a binding for events streamed over the NETCONF
   protocol [RFC6241] for dynamic subscriptions as defined in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications].  In addition, as
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push] is itself built upon
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications], this document

Internet-Draft                NETCONF-notif                 October 2018


   enables a NETCONF client to request via a dynamic subscription and
   receive updates from a YANG datastore located on a NETCONF server.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are defined in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications]: dynamic
   subscription, event stream, notification message, publisher,
   receiver, subscriber, subscription.

3.  Compatibility with RFC-5277's create-subscription

   A publisher is allowed to concurrently support dynamic subscription
   RPCs of [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] at the same
   time as [RFC5277]'s "create-subscription" RPC.  However a single
   NETCONF transport session cannot support both this specification and
   a subscription established by [RFC5277]'s "create-subscription" RPC.
   To protect against any attempts to use a single NETCONF transport
   session in this way:

   o  A solution must reply with the [RFC6241] error "operation-not-
      supported" if a "create-subscription" RPC is received on a NETCONF
      session where an [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications]
      established subscription exists.
   o  A solution must reply with the [RFC6241] error "operation-not-
      supported" if an "establish-subscription" request is been received
      on a NETCONF session where the "create-subscription" RPC has
      successfully [RFC5277] created a subscription.

   If a publisher supports this specification but not subscriptions via
   [RFC5277], the publisher MUST NOT advertise
   "urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:notification:1.0".

4.  Mandatory XML, event stream and datastore support

   The "encode-xml" feature of
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] is mandatory to
   support.  This indicates that XML is a valid encoding for RPCs, state
   change notifications, and subscribed content.

Internet-Draft                NETCONF-notif                 October 2018


   A NETCONF publisher supporting event stream subscription via
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] MUST support the
   "NETCONF" event stream identified in that draft.

5.  NETCONF connectivity and the Dynamic Subscriptions

   For a dynamic subscription, if the NETCONF session involved with the
   "establish-subscription" terminates, the subscription MUST be
   terminated.

   For a dynamic subscription a "modify-subscription", "delete-
   subscription", or "resynch-subscription" RPC MUST be sent using same
   the NETCONF session upon which the referenced subscription was
   established.

6.  Notification Messages

   Notification messages transported over the NETCONF protocol MUST be
   encoded in a <notification> message as defined within [RFC5277],
   Section 4.  And per [RFC5277]'s "eventTime" object definition, the
   "eventTime" MUST be populated with the event occurrence time.

   For dynamic subscriptions, all notification messages MUST use the
   NETCONF transport session used by the "establish-subscription" RPC.

7.  Dynamic Subscriptions and RPC Error Responses

   Management of dynamic subscriptions occurs via RPCs as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push] and
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications].  When an RPC error
   occurs, the NETCONF RPC reply MUST include an "rpc-error" element per
   [RFC6241] with the error information populated as follows:

   o  an "error-type" node of "application".
   o  an "error-tag" node of "operation-failed".
   o  an "error-severity" of "error" (this MAY but does not have to be
      included).
   o  an "error-app-tag" node with the value being a string that
      corresponds to an identity associated with the error, as defined
      in [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] section 2.4.6
      for general subscriptions, and [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push]
      Appendix A.1, for datastore subscriptions.  The specific identity
      to use depends on the RPC for which the error occurred.  Viable
      errors for different RPCs are as follows:

            RPC                     use base identity
            ----------------------  ----------------------------
            establish-subscription  establish-subscription-error
            modify-subscription     modify-subscription-error
            delete-subscription     delete-subscription-error
            kill-subscription       kill-subscription-error
            resynch-subscription    resynch-subscription-error

   Each error identity will be inserted as the "error-app-tag" using
   JSON encoding following the form <modulename>:<identityname>.  An
   example of such as valid encoding would be "ietf-subscribed-
   notifications:no-such-subscription".

   o  In case of error responses to an "establish-subscription" or
      "modify-subscription" request there is the option of including an
      "error-info" node.  This node may contain XML-encoded data with
      hints for parameter settings that might lead to successful RPC
      requests in the future.  Following are the yang-data structures
      which may be returned:

      establish-subscription returns hints in yang-data structure
      ---------------------- ------------------------------------
      target: event stream   establish-subscription-stream-error-info
      target: datastore      establish-subscription-datastore-error-info

      modify-subscription    returns hints in yang-data structure
      ---------------------- ------------------------------------
      target: event stream   modify-subscription-stream-error-info
      target: datastore      modify-subscription-datastore-error-info

      The yang-data included within "error-info" SHOULD NOT include the
      optional leaf "error-reason", as such a leaf would be redundant
      with information that is already placed within the
      "error-app-tag".

      In case of an rpc error resulting from a "delete-subscription",
      "kill-subscription", or "resynch-subscription" request, no
      "error-info" needs to be included, as the "subscription-id" is
      the only RPC input parameter and no hints regarding this RPC input
      parameters need to be provided.

8.  Security Considerations

   If a malicious or buggy NETCONF subscriber sends a number of
   establish-subscription requests, then these subscriptions accumulate
   and may use up system resources.  In such a situation, subscriptions
   MAY be terminated by terminating the underlying NETCONF session.  The

   publisher MAY also suspend or terminate a subset of the active
   subscriptions on that NETCONF session.

10.  Notes to the RFC Editor

   This section can be removed by the RFC editor after the requests have
   been performed.

   RFC 6241 need to be updated.  RFC-6241 refers to RFC-5277 which says
   that a notification message can only be sent after a successful
   "create-subscription".  This text must be modified to also allow
   notification messages be sent after a successful "establish-
   subscription".

Appendix A.  Examples

   This section is non-normative.

A.1.  Event Stream Discovery

   As defined in [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] an
   event stream exposes a continuous set of events available for
   subscription.  A NETCONF client can retrieve the list of available
   event streams from a NETCONF publisher using the "get" operation
   against the top-level container "/streams" defined in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] Section 3.1.

   The following example illustrates the retrieval of the list of
   available event streams:

<rpc message-id="101"
  xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
  <get>
    <filter type="subtree">
      <streams
     xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-subscribed-notifications"/>
    </filter>
  </get>
</rpc>

Internet-Draft                NETCONF-notif                 October 2018


   After such a request, the NETCONF publisher returns a list of event
   streams available, as well as additional information which might
   exist in the container.

A.2.  Dynamic Subscriptions

A.2.1.  Establishing Dynamic Subscriptions

   The following figure shows two successful "establish-subscription"
   RPC requests as per
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications].  The first request
   is given a subscription "id" of 22, the second, an "id" of 23.

      | Subscriber |                 | Publisher |

   To provide examples of the information being transported, example
   messages for interactions (a) and (b) in Figure 2 are detailed below:

   As NETCONF publisher was able to fully satisfy the request (a), the
   publisher sends the subscription "id" of the accepted subscription
   within message (b):

   If the NETCONF publisher had not been able to fully satisfy the
   request, or subscriber has no authorization to establish the
   subscription, the publisher would have sent an RPC error response.
   For instance, if the "dscp" value of 10 asserted by the subscriber in
   Figure 3 proved unacceptable, the publisher may have returned:

   <rpc-reply message-id="102"
     xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
     <rpc-error>
      <error-type>application</error-type>

   The subscriber can use this information in future attempts to

A.2.2.  Modifying Dynamic Subscriptions

   An existing subscription may be modified.  The following exchange
   shows a negotiation of such a modification via several exchanges
   between a subscriber and a publisher.  This negotiation consists of a
   failed RPC modification request/response, followed by a successful
   one.

      +------------+                 +-----------+
      | Subscriber |                 | Publisher |
      +------------+                 +-----------+
            |                              |

   Figure 6: Interaction model for successful subscription modification

   If the subscription being modified in Figure 6 is a datastore
   subscription as per [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push], the modification
   request made in (c) may look like that shown in Figure 7.  As can be
   seen, the modifications being attempted are the application of a new
   xpath filter as well as the setting of a new periodic time interval.

   If the NETCONF publisher can satisfy both changes, the publisher
   sends a positive result for the RPC.  If the NETCONF publisher cannot
   satisfy either of the proposed changes, the publisher sends an RPC
   error response (d).  The following is an example RPC error response
   for (d) which includes a hint.  This hint is an alternative time
   period value which might have resulted in a successful modification:

A.2.3.  Deleting Dynamic Subscriptions

   The following demonstrates deleting a subscription.  This
   subscription may have been to either a stream or a datastore.

  <rpc message-id="103"
    xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
    <delete-subscription
      xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-subscribed-notifications">
      <id>22</id>
    </delete-subscription>
  </rpc>

                       Figure 9: Delete subscription

   If the NETCONF publisher can satisfy the request, the publisher
   replies with success to the RPC request.

   If the NETCONF publisher cannot satisfy the request, the publisher
   sends an error-rpc element indicating the modification didn't work.
   Figure 10 shows a valid response for existing valid subscription
   "id", but that subscription "id" was created on a different NETCONF
   transport session:

   <rpc-reply message-id="103"
     xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
     <rpc-error>
       <error-type>application</error-type>
       <error-tag>operation-failed</error-tag>
       <error-severity>error</error-severity>
       <error-app-tag>
           ietf-subscribed-notifications:no-such-subscription

A.3.  Subscription State Notifications

   A publisher will send subscription state notifications for dynamic
   subscriptions according to the definitions within
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications]).

A.3.1.  subscription-modified

   As per Section 2.7.2 of
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications], a "subscription-
   modified" might be sent if over NETCONF if the definition of a
   configured filter changes.  A subscription state notification encoded
   in XML would look like:

<notification xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:notification:1.0">
  <eventTime>2007-09-01T10:00:00Z</eventTime>
  <subscription-modified
      xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-subscribed-notifications">
    <id>39</id>
    <transport xmlns:nsn=
    "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications">
      nsn:netconf
    <transport>
    <stream-xpath-filter xmlns:ex="http://example.com/events">
      /ex:foo
    </stream-xpath-filter>
    <stream>NETCONF</stream>
  </subscription-modified>
</notification>

     Figure 11: subscription-modified subscription state notification

A.3.2.  subscription-resumed, and replay-complete

   A "subscription-resumed" would look like:

  <notification
    xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:notification:1.0">
    <eventTime>2007-09-01T10:00:00Z</eventTime>
    <subscription-resumed
      xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-subscribed-notifications">
      <id>39</id>
    </subscription-resumed>
  </notification>

            Figure 12: subscription-resumed notification in XML

   The "replay-complete" is virtually identical, with "subscription-
   resumed" simply being replaced by "replay-complete".

A.3.3.  subscription-terminated and subscription-suspended

   A "subscription-terminated" would look like:

  <notification
    xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:notification:1.0">
    <eventTime>2007-09-01T10:00:00Z</eventTime>
    <subscription-terminated
      xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-subscribed-notifications">
      <id>39</id>
      <reason>
         suspension-timeout
      </reason>
    </subscription-terminated>
  </notification>

    Figure 13: subscription-terminated subscription state notification

   The "subscription-suspended" is virtually identical, with
   "subscription-terminated" simply being replaced by "subscription-
   suspended".

A.4.  Filter Examples

   This section provides examples which illustrate both xpath and
   subtree methods of filtering event record contents.  The examples are
   based on the YANG notification "vrrp-protocol-error-event" as defined
   per the ietf-vrrp.yang model within [RFC8347].  Event records based
   on this specification which are generated by the publisher might
   appear as:

  <notification xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:notification:1.0">
    <eventTime>2018-09-14T08:22:33.44Z</eventTime>
    <vrrp-protocol-error-event
         xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-vrrp">
       <protocol-error-reason>checksum-error</protocol-error-reason>
    </vrrp-protocol-error-event>
  </notification>

             Figure 14: RFC 8347 (VRRP) - Example Notification

   Suppose a subscriber wanted to establish a subscription which only
   passes instances of event records where there is a "checksum-error"
   as part of a VRRP protocol event.  Also assume the publisher places
   such event records into the NETCONF stream.  To get a continuous
   series of matching event records, the subscriber might request the
   application of an XPath filter against the NETCONF stream.  An
   "establish-subscription" RPC to meet this objective might be:

    </stream-xpath-filter>
  </establish-subscription>
</rpc>

       Figure 15: Establishing a subscription error reason via XPATH

   For more examples of xpath filters, see [XPATH].

   Suppose the "establish-subscription" in Figure 15 was accepted.  And
   suppose later a subscriber decided they wanted to broaden this
   subscription cover to all VRRP protocol events (i.e., not just those
   with a "checksum error").  The subscriber might attempt to modify the
   subscription in a way which replaces the XPath filter with a subtree
   filter which sends all VRRP protocol events to a subscriber.  Such a
   "modify-subscription" RPC might look like:

 <rpc message-id="602" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
   <modify-subscription
      xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-subscribed-notifications">
     <id>99</id>
     <stream-subtree-filter>
      <vrrp-protocol-error-event
             xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-vrrp"/>
     </stream-subtree-filter>
   </modify-subscription>
 </rpc>

   For more examples of subtree filters, see [RFC6241], section 6.4.
