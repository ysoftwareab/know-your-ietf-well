Abstract 
    
   This draft describes a simple mechanism that ease discovery of remote 
   Autonomous   Systems   (AS)   supporting   inter-domain   MPLS-based 
   constrained tunnels service (this service is also denoted by Path 
   Computation Service (PCSv)) thanks to the use of Path Computation 
   Elements (PCEs). Remote ASs could be managed by a single or distinct 
   Internet Network Providers (INP).  
   Particularly, this draft describes how Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) 
   is used to announce Path Computation Service unique identifiers

        order to satisfy PCC constraints. 
    
     o High-level service: is the service using a PCE-based system as 
        an underlying infrastructure (an inter-domain QoS VPNs service 
        for instance) 
    
     o High-level service customer: is a customer that subscribes to a 
        High-level service.

        Network Providers (INP) with the purpose of extending the 
        geographical span of their service offers. 
 
     o SLS Management: This management entity is responsible for SLS-
        related activites, including  pSLS ordering (i.e establishing 
        contracts between peers) and SLS invocation (i.e committing 
        resources before traffic can be admitted) 
 
     o q-BGP: QoS-inferred BGP. A modified BGP protocol that takes into 
        account  QoS  information  as  input  for  its  route  selection 
        process. 
 
     o Domain: within this draft it denotes an Autonomous system.           
    
    
4.   Introduction 
    
4.1.     General 
    
   Recently, several proposals describing the use of a Path Computation 
   Element (PCE) as additional element to existent IP network entities 
   have been submitted to the IETF. The main objective of introducing a 
   PCE  element  is  to  ease  computation  of  constrained  paths  in 
   sophisticated schemes like inter-domain (both in intra-provider or 
   inter-provider) and then driving the establishment of inter-domain 
   LSPs. 
    
   A framework for establishing and controlling Multi-Protocol Label 
   Switching  Protocol  (MPLS)  and  Generalized  MPLS  (GMPLS)  Label 
   Switching Paths (LSPs) in multi-domain networks has been defined in 
   [CCAMP-FWRK]. The notion of domain in this framework draft encloses 
   both Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) areas and Autonomous System (AS) 
   contrary to the current draft that restricts the notion of domain to 
   a single AS.

Internet Draft      PCE Discovery via Border Gateway            May 2005 
                                Protocol 
                                     
    
   Another draft that proposes a solution to compute inter-domain 
   constrained paths has been submitted to the IETF [INTERAS-PCE]. This 
   draft  takes  into  account  the  inter-provider  specific  service 
   considerations. In addition, the draft [INTERAS-PCP] describes a new 
   protocol allowing communication between two PCEs located in different 
   domains in order to compute inter-domain paths satisfying a set of 
   constraints.  
    
   All aforementioned drafts require a Path Computation Service (PCSv) 
   discovery function that allows discovery of remote ASs supporting 
   this  type  of  service  (the  path  computation  service  could  be 
   implemented by one or several PCE elements) together with theirs 
   associated                     capabilities                     like  
   QoS capabilities, inter-domain bandwidth, reachable IP prefixes, type 
   of links, etc. Discovery of such capabilities could also be passive 
   and be restricted to a simple service advertisement (like web-pages). 
   PCSv locations and associated capabilities discovery depends on 
   providers search. We will refer to this method as passive discovery 
   method.  
    
   It  is  evident  that  passive  method  allows  finding  remote  PCSv 
   locations and their associated capabilities, but this information is 
   not usable alone within a distributed PCE architecture, when a set of 
   end-to-end constraints must be satisfied. Therefore, computation of 
   end-to-end  constraints  must  be  achieved  based  on  advertised 
   individual PCE capabilities. The knowledge of the PCE path is then 
   mandatory in order to deduce the end-to-end capabilities.  
    
   In this draft, we present a simple method that allows discovery of 
   remote PCSv with their associated capabilities. This method will also 
   help the PCE decision-making process to choose the next PCE to 
   contact in order to optimize paths towards a given destination. 
    
    
4.2.     Structure of the draft 
    
   This draft is structured as follows: 
    
      o Section 5 gives an overview of the service approach; 
      o Section 6 argues on the need of PCSv discovery functions; 
      o Section 7 presents a solution proposal for PCSv discovery.

Internet Draft      PCE Discovery via Border Gateway            May 2005

6.   PCE discovery within a single domain  
    
   Within a single domain, discovery of PCSv location and capabilities 
   could be achieved for instance thanks to the activation of the 
   Service Location Protocol (SLP, [RFC2608]). This protocol allows 
   discovery   of   activated   services   that   uses   client/service 
   architecture. SLP defines the same framework for all services. 
    
   In order to use SLP as a means to discover PCSvs, a PCE Service Type 
   Template SHOULD be defined. 
    
    
7.   Overview of the service approach 
    
   Neighboring domains establish pSLSs (a pSLS is an enhanced SLS 
   agreement between two providers. SLS template is defined in [SLS]) 
   between  them  in  order  to  have  appropriate  rights  to  request 
   establishment of LSPs. An inter-domain routing protocol runs between 
   the domains (for instance Border Gateway Protocol (BGP, [RFC1771])). 
   The LSP creation request is propagated downstream to appropriate 
   PCEs. The requests include the AS's ASBR and the tail-end address of 
   the LSP. This procedure is repeated until the request reaches the 
   destination PCE.

   PCE  accepting  the  request  and  include  the  LSP  loose  path 
   (destination, ASBR) addresses in the message. The next downstream 
   domain's PCE does the same and adds its own relevant ASBR addresses 
   to the loose path. The originating PCE inserts its intra-domain path 
   and  then  initializes  an  RSVP  reservation  request  for  LSP 
   establishment using the returned loose path. 
     
   At the service/application level (in order to differentiate this 
   service from extending scope of IP connectivity service, we will 
   denote it as high level service), when originating AS wants to 
   establish an LSP to a destination in a remote ASs, there MUST be an 
   agreement between the two ASs.  
    
    
8.   Service Advertisement and Discovery 
    
   Within  this  draft,  we  make  a  difference  between  the  Service 
   Advertisement and Discovery (SAD) and PCSv discovery function. SAD is 
   a function that is achieved before establishing a service agreement 
   between  two  peers.  The  SAD  operation  consists  mainly  at 
   advertising/learning  from/to  the  rest  of  the  Internet  the 
   capabilities supported by a given AS in term of offered services 
   (like Inter-domain LSP establishment service). PCSv advertisement is 
   conditioned by the existence of a pSLS between two peers.

Internet Draft      PCE Discovery via Border Gateway            May 2005

   build it own services. Thus, a negotiation process SHOULD start and 
   an SLS MAY be agreed between the two parties.  
    
   During service negotiation between two Service Providers, they MAY 
   exchange  their  PCE  reachability  information  and  associated 
   capabilities. Theses capabilities could include the following: 
    
     o Supported Computation algorithms 
     o Types of Constraints (e.g. QoS) 
     o Set of attributes for a given constraint (one-way delay, one-way 
        delay variationà) 
     o Support of P2MP path computation techniques, 
    
   As  a  consequence  each  INP  has  a  full  knowledge  of  the  PCE 
   capabilities of its adjacent providers. 
    
    
9.   Why PCE discovery is needed 
    
   Path Computation elements are responsible for finding inter-domain 
   paths  satisfying  a  set  of  constraints  (like  QoS  performance 
   guarantees) to establish inter-domain constraint-based LSPs. The 
   computation of this path is distributed and needs PCEs from different 
   domains to communicate. Communication between two PCE entities is 
   enabled thanks to inter PCE Communication Protocol (PCP) [INTERAS-
   PCP]. 
    
   When receiving a request from the "High-Level" Service Management to 
   compute/find a path towards a given tail-end address, the local PCE 
   has to determine the next PCE to contact. In the worst case, local 
   PCE can contact all its neighboring PCEs that are known to Service 
   Management System. Nevertheless, it has no criteria to choose between 
   those PCEs the next PCE to be contacted in order to send its path 
   computation request. The risk of a request failure is then important.  
    
   In order to help the PCE decision-making process to choose the next 
   PCE to be contacted, local PCE need to discover remote PCSvs 
   reachable beyond the immediate neighbor PCEs. This information will 
   help the next hop PCE decision. PCE need at least access to intra and 
   inter-domain Routing Information Bases (RIB) in order to check the 
   reachability status of destination prefixes if are propagated thanks 
   to routing protocols. 
    
    
10.    Solution for PCSv discovery 
    
   Within this draft, we assume that during service negotiation phase 
   between two peers, they MUST exchange IP addresses of their PCE(s). 
   SLS Management Systems of the two peers MUST store this information.

Internet Draft      PCE Discovery via Border Gateway            May 2005 
                                Protocol 
                                     
   In order to help the PCE computation process, routing information 
   MUST be made available for the PCE. Thus, reachability information 
   associated with capabilities (like QoS intra and/or inter-domain 
   capabilities) SHOULD be propagated in the routing level. In the case 
   of QoS-based service, each potential tail-end address (practically 
   all routers interfaces) SHOULD be announced in all offered QoS Class 
   plans (i.e. as many as used DSCP values). As a consequence, routing 
   tables sizes will drastically increase. 
    
   From this perspective, instead of announcing all potential tail-end 
   addresses in BGP, only an identifier needs to be announced. It is 
   called  the  Path  Computation  Service  Identifier  (PCSID).  This 
   particular BGP announcement is identified by a well-known community 
   value (to be defined be IANA) and is represented by a routable IP 
   address, which can be different from the real IP address of the PCE. 
    
   As a consequence, this particular route SHOULD NOT be installed in 
   the Forwarding Information Base (FIB) since this PCSID is not 
   necessarily the IP address of the PCE. 
    
   BGP announcements of PCSID will ease to discover the set of remote 
   ASs supporting the inter-AS MPLS-based constrained tunnels service 
   together with their associated end-to-end capabilities for reaching 
   them. In order to compute a path towards a specific domain supporting 
   this inter-AS MPLS-based constrained tunnels service, the local PCE 
   chooses a route that serves the PCSID of that domain and extracts 
   from the AS_PATH attribute the AS number of the next hop ASBR. Then, 
   the local PCE queries its SLS Management system and gets back the 
   PCE's IP address of the next neighboring PCE to contact. Finally, the 
   local PCE forms and forwards a path computation request to this next 
   PCE. The process is iteratively repeated until the request reaches 
   the PCE of the target AS identified by its PCSID. 
 
   This solution decreases the number of BGP announcements that are 
   reduced to one announcement per AS.  
    
    
11.    IANA Considerations 
    
   The solution proposed in this draft uses a well-know community 
   attribute value that SHOULD be attributed by IANA [RFC2434] in order 
   to facilitate recognition of BGP announcements that announce PCSv and 
   associated capabilities. 
    
    
12.    Security Considerations 
    
   This additional draft does not change the underlying security issues 
   in the existing BGP-4 protocol specification [RFC2385].
