1.  Introduction

   TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] supports Pre-Shared Key (PSK) authentication,
   wherein PSKs can be established via session tickets from prior
   connections or externally via some out-of-band mechanism.  The
   protocol mandates that each PSK only be used with a single hash
   function.  This was done to simplify protocol analysis.  TLS 1.2
   [RFC5246], in contrast, has no such requirement, as a PSK may be used
   with any hash algorithm and the TLS 1.2 pseudorandom function (PRF).
   While there is no known way in which the same external PSK might
   produce related output in TLS 1.3 and prior versions, only limited
   analysis has been done.  Applications SHOULD provision separate PSKs
   for TLS 1.3 and prior versions.

   To mitigate against any interference, this document specifies a PSK
   Importer interface by which external PSKs may be imported and
   subsequently bound to a specific key derivation function (KDF) and
   hash function for use in TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] and DTLS 1.3 [DTLS13].  In
   particular, it describes a mechanism for differentiating external
   PSKs by the target KDF, (D)TLS protocol version, and an optional
   context string.  This process yields a set of candidate PSKs, each of
   which are bound to a target KDF and protocol, that are separate from
   those used in (D)TLS 1.2 and prior versions.  This expands what would
   normally have been a single PSK and identity into a set of PSKs and
   identities.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Overview

   The PSK Importer interface mirrors that of the TLS Exporters
   interface in that it diversifies a key based on some contextual
   information.  In contrast to the Exporters interface, wherein
   differentiation is done via an explicit label and context string, the
   PSK Importer interface defined herein takes an external PSK and
   identity and "imports" it into TLS, creating a set of "derived" PSKs
   and identities.  Each of these derived PSKs are bound a target
   protocol, KDF identifier, and optional context string.  Additionally,
   the resulting PSK binder keys are modified with a new derivation
   label to prevent confusion with non-imported PSKs.  Through this
   interface, importing external PSKs with different identities yields
   distinct PSK binder keys.

   Imported keys do not require negotiation for use since a client and
   server will not agree upon identities if imported incorrectly.
   Endpoints may incrementally deploy PSK Importer support by offering
   non-imported keys for TLS versions prior to TLS 1.3.  Non-imported
   and imported PSKs are distinct since their identities are different
   on the wire.  See Section 6 for more details.

   Endpoints which import external keys MUST NOT use either the external
   keys or the derived keys for any other purpose.  Moreover, each
   external PSK MUST be associated with at most one hash function, as
   per the rules in Section 4.2.11 from [RFC8446].  See Section 7 for
   more discussion.

3.1.  Terminology

   *  External PSK (EPSK): A PSK established or provisioned out-of-band,
      i.e., not from a TLS connection, which is a tuple of (Base Key,
      External Identity, Hash).

   *  Base Key: The secret value of an EPSK.

   *  External Identity: A sequence of bytes used to identify an EPSK.

   *  Target protocol: The protocol for which a PSK is imported for use.

   *  Target KDF: The KDF for which a PSK is imported for use.

   *  Imported PSK (IPSK): A PSK derived from an EPSK, External
      Identity, optional context string, target protocol, and target
      KDF.

   *  Imported Identity: A sequence of bytes used to identify an IPSK.

4.  PSK Import

   This section describes the PSK Importer interface and its underlying
   diversification mechanism and binder key computation modification.

4.1.  External PSK Diversification

   The PSK Importer interface takes as input an EPSK with External
   Identity "external_identity" and base key "epsk", as defined in
   Section 3.1, along with an optional context, and transforms it into a
   set of PSKs and imported identities for use in a connection based on
   target protocols and KDFs.  In particular, for each supported target
   protocol "target_protocol" and KDF "target_kdf", the importer
   constructs an ImportedIdentity structure as follows:

   struct {
      opaque external_identity<1...2^16-1>;
      opaque context<0..2^16-1>;
      uint16 target_protocol;
      uint16 target_kdf;
   } ImportedIdentity;

   The list of ImportedIdentity.target_kdf values is maintained by IANA
   as described in Section 9.  External PSKs MUST NOT be imported for
   (D)TLS 1.2 or prior versions.  See Section 6 for discussion on how
   imported PSKs for TLS 1.3 and non-imported PSKs for earlier versions
   co-exist for incremental deployment.

   ImportedIdentity.context MUST include the context used to derive the
   EPSK, if any exists.  For example, ImportedIdentity.context may
   include information about peer roles or identities to mitigate
   Selfie-style reflection attacks [Selfie].  See Appendix B for more
   details.  If the EPSK is a key derived from some other protocol or
   sequence of protocols, ImportedIdentity.context MUST include a
   channel binding for the deriving protocols [RFC5056].  The details of
   this binding are protocol specific and out of scope for this
   document.

   ImportedIdentity.target_protocol MUST be the (D)TLS protocol version
   for which the PSK is being imported.  For example, TLS 1.3 [RFC8446]

   uses 0x0304, which will therefore also be used by QUICv1 [QUIC].
   Note that this means future versions of TLS will increase the number
   of PSKs derived from an external PSK.

   Given an ImportedIdentity and corresponding EPSK with base key
   "epsk", an Imported PSK IPSK with base key "ipskx" is computed as
   follows:

      epskx = HKDF-Extract(0, epsk)
      ipskx = HKDF-Expand-Label(epskx, "derived psk",
                                Hash(ImportedIdentity), L)

   L corresponds to the KDF output length of ImportedIdentity.target_kdf
   as defined in Section 9.  For hash-based KDFs, such as
   HKDF_SHA256(0x0001), this is the length of the hash function output,
   i.e., 32 octets.  This is required for the IPSK to be of length
   suitable for supported ciphersuites.

   The identity of "ipskx" as sent on the wire is ImportedIdentity,
   i.e., the serialized content of ImportedIdentity is used as the
   content of PskIdentity.identity in the PSK extension.  The
   corresponding TLS 1.3 binder key is "ipskx".

   The hash function used for HKDF [RFC5869] is that which is associated
   with the EPSK.  It is not the hash function associated with
   ImportedIdentity.target_kdf.  If no hash function is specified,
   SHA-256 [SHA2] MUST be used.  Diversifying EPSK by
   ImportedIdentity.target_kdf ensures that an IPSK is only used as
   input keying material to at most one KDF, thus satisfying the
   requirements in [RFC8446].  See Section 7 for more details.

   Endpoints SHOULD generate a compatible "ipskx" for each target
   ciphersuite they offer.  For example, importing a key for
   TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 and TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 would yield two
   PSKs, one for HKDF-SHA256 and another for HKDF-SHA384.  In contrast,
   if TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 and TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 are
   supported, only one derived key is necessary.

   EPSKs MAY be imported before the start of a connection if the target
   KDFs, protocols, and context string(s) are known a priori.  EPSKs MAY
   also be imported for early data use if they are bound to protocol
   settings and configurations that would otherwise be required for
   early data with normal (ticket-based PSK) resumption.  Minimally,
   that means Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation [RFC7301], QUIC
   transport parameters (if used for QUIC), and any other relevant
   parameters that are negotiated for early data MUST be provisioned
   alongside these EPSKs.

4.2.  Binder Key Derivation

   To prevent confusion between imported and non-imported PSKs, imported
   PSKs change the PSK binder key derivation label.  In particular, the
   standard TLS 1.3 PSK binder key computation is defined as follows:

              0
              |
              v
    PSK ->  HKDF-Extract = Early Secret
              |
              +-----> Derive-Secret(., "ext binder" | "res binder", "")
              |                     = binder_key
              V

   Imported PSKs replace the string "ext binder" with "imp binder" when
   deriving "binder_key".  This means the binder key is computed as
   follows:

              0
              |
              v
    PSK ->  HKDF-Extract = Early Secret
              |
              +-----> Derive-Secret(., "ext binder"
              |                      | "res binder"
              |                      | "imp binder", "")
              |                     = binder_key
              V

   This new label ensures a client and server will negotiate use of an
   external PSK if and only if (a) both endpoints import the PSK or (b)
   neither endpoint imports the PSK.  As "binder_key" is a leaf key,
   changing its computation does not affect any other key.

5.  Deprecating Hash Functions

   If a client or server wish to deprecate a hash function and no longer
   use it for TLS 1.3, they remove the corresponding KDF from the set of
   target KDFs used for importing keys.  This does not affect the KDF
   operation used to derive Imported PSKs.

6.  Incremental Deployment

   Recall that TLS 1.2 permits computing the TLS PRF with any hash
   algorithm and PSK.  Thus, an EPSK may be used with the same KDF (and
   underlying HMAC hash algorithm) as TLS 1.3 with importers.  However,
   critically, the derived PSK will not be the same since the importer
   differentiates the PSK via the identity and target KDF and protocol.
   Thus, PSKs imported for TLS 1.3 are distinct from those used in TLS
   1.2, and thereby avoid cross-protocol collisions.  Note that this
   does not preclude endpoints from using non-imported PSKs for TLS 1.2.
   Indeed, this is necessary for incremental deployment.  Specifically,
   existing applications using TLS 1.2 with non-imported PSKs can safely
   enable TLS 1.3 with imported PSKs in clients and servers without
   interoperability risk.

7.  Security Considerations

   The PSK Importer security goals can be roughly stated as follows:
   avoid PSK re-use across KDFs while properly authenticating endpoints.
   When modeled as computational extractors, KDFs assume that input
   keying material (IKM) is sampled from some "source" probability
   distribution and that any two IKM values are chosen independently of
   each other [Kraw10].  This source-independence requirement implies
   that the same IKM value cannot be used for two different KDFs.

   PSK-based authentication is functionally equivalent to session
   resumption in that a connection uses existing key material to
   authenticate both endpoints.  Following the work of [BAA15], this is
   a form of compound authentication.  Loosely speaking, compound
   authentication is the property that an execution of multiple
   authentication protocols, wherein at least one is uncompromised,
   jointly authenticates all protocols.  Authenticating with an
   externally provisioned PSK, therefore, should ideally authenticate
   both the TLS connection and the external provisioning process.
   Typically, the external provision process produces a PSK and
   corresponding context from which the PSK was derived and in which it
   should be used.  If available, this is used as the
   ImportedIdentity.context value.  We refer to an external PSK without
   such context as "context-free".

   Thus, in considering the source-independence and compound
   authentication requirements, the PSK Import interface described in
   this document aims to achieve the following goals:

   1.  Externally provisioned PSKs imported into a TLS connection
       achieve compound authentication of the provisioning process and
       connection.

Internet-Draft       Importing External PSKs for TLS       December 2020


   2.  Context-free PSKs only achieve authentication within the context
       of a single connection.

   3.  Imported PSKs are not used as IKM for two different KDFs.

   4.  Imported PSKs do not collide with future protocol versions and
       KDFs.

   There is no known interference between the process for computing
   Imported PSKs from an external PSK and the processing of existing
   external PSKs used in (D)TLS 1.2 and below.  However, only limited
   analysis has been done, which is an additional reason why
   applications SHOULD provision separate PSKs for (D)TLS 1.3 and prior
   versions, even when the importer interface is used in (D)TLS 1.3.

   The PSK Importer does not prevent applications from constructing non-
   importer PSK identities that collide with imported PSK identities.

8.  Privacy Considerations

   External PSK identities are typically static by design so that
   endpoints may use them to lookup keying material.  However, for some
   systems and use cases, this identity may become a persistent tracking
   identifier.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This specification introduces a new registry for TLS KDF identifiers,
   titled "TLS KDF Identifiers", under the existing "Transport Layer
   Security (TLS) Parameters" heading.

   The entries in the registry are:

                 +-----------------+--------+-----------+
                 | KDF Description | Value  | Reference |
                 +=================+========+===========+
                 | Reserved        | 0x0000 | N/A       |
                 +-----------------+--------+-----------+
                 | HKDF_SHA256     | 0x0001 | [RFC5869] |
                 +-----------------+--------+-----------+
                 | HKDF_SHA384     | 0x0002 | [RFC5869] |
                 +-----------------+--------+-----------+

   New target KDF values are allocated according to the following
   process:

Appendix B.  Addressing Selfie

   The Selfie attack [Selfie] relies on a misuse of the PSK interface.
   The PSK interface makes the implicit assumption that each PSK is
   known only to one client and one server.  If multiple clients or
   multiple servers with distinct roles share a PSK, TLS only
   authenticates the entire group.  A node successfully authenticates
   its peer as being in the group whether the peer is another node or
   itself.

   Applications which require authenticating finer-grained roles while
   still configuring a single shared PSK across all nodes can resolve
   this mismatch either by exchanging roles over the TLS connection
   after the handshake or by incorporating the roles of both the client
   and server into the IPSK context string.  For instance, if an
   application identifies each node by MAC address, it could use the
   following context string.

     struct {
       opaque client_mac<0..2^16-1>;
       opaque server_mac<0..2^16-1>;
     } Context;

   If an attacker then redirects a ClientHello intended for one node to
   a different node, the receiver will compute a different context
   string and the handshake will not complete.

   Note that, in this scenario, there is still a single shared PSK
   across all nodes, so each node must be trusted not to impersonate
   another node's role.
