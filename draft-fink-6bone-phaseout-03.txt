Abstract

    The 6bone was established in 1996 by the IETF as an IPv6 Testbed
    network to enable various IPv6 testing as well as to assist in the
    transitioning of IPv6 into the Internet. It operates under the IPv6
    address allocation 3FFE::/16 from RFC 2471. As IPv6 is beginning its
    production deployment it is appropriate to plan for the phaseout of
    the 6bone. This note establishes a plan for a multi-year phaseout of
    the 6bone and its address allocation on the assumption that the IETF
    is the appropriate place to determine this.

    This document is intended to obsolete RFC 2471, "IPv6 Testing Address

    Allocation", December, 1998.  RFC 2471 will become historic.


1.0 Introduction

    The 6bone IPv6 Testbed network was established in March 1996,
    becoming operational during the summer of 1996 using an IPv6 testing
    address allocation of 5F00::/8 [TEST-OLD] using the original (and now
    obsolete) provider based unicast address format. In July 1998 a new
    IPv6 Addressing Architecture [ARCH] replaced the original provider
    based unicast address format with the now standardized Aggregatable
    Global Unicast Address Format [AGGR].

    To allow the 6bone to operate under the revised IPv6 address
    architecture with the new Aggregatable Global Unicast addressing
    format, [1] was replaced with a new IPv6 testing address allocation"
    of 3FFE::/16 in [TEST=NEW]. During the fall of 1998, in anticipation
    of [4], the 6bone was re-addressed under the 3FFE::/16 prefix with
    little problems.

    From the fall of 1998, until the issuance of this note, the 6bone has
    continued to successfully operate with Aggregatable Global Unicast
    Address prefixes from the 3FFE::/16 allocation, using a set of 6bone
    routing practice rules specified in [GUIDE], and later refined to
    6Bone backbone routing guidelines in [PRACTICE].

    During its lifetime the 6bone has provided:

       - a place for early standard developers and implementers to test
         out the IPv6 protocols and their implementations;

       - a place for early experimentation with routing and operational
         procedures;

       - a place to evolve practices useful for production IPv6 prefix
         allocation;

       - a place to provide bootstrap qualification for production IPv6
         address prefix allocation;

       - a place to develop IPv6 applications;

       - a place for early users to try using IPv6 in their hosts and
         networks.

    As clearly stated in [TEST-NEW], the addresses for the 6bone are
    temporary and will be reclaimed in the future. It further states that
    all users of these addresses (within the 3FFE::/16 prefix) will be

    required to renumber at some time in the future.

    Since 1999 planning for, and allocation of, IPv6 production address
    prefixes by the Regional Internet Registry (RIR) community has been
    underway. During 2002 more production IPv6 address prefixes had been
    allocated than are allocated by the 6bone at the top level. It is
    generally assumed that this is one reasonable indicator that planning
    for a 6bone phaseout should begin.

    It is generally assumed that there is still some remaining need for
    the 6bone, at least for current usage that will take time to evaluate
    and possibly move to production IPv6 networks when possible.

    It is generally viewed that the 6bone is an IETF activity as it was
    established by IETF participants to assist the IETF in developing
    IPv6 protocols, and also to assist in the IPv6 transition. To this
    end, the [TEST-NEW] RFC specified that the 6bone testing was to be
    under the auspices of the IETF IPng Transition (ngtrans) Working
    Group 6bone testbed activity. However, during 2002 the ngtrans
    working group was terminated and replaced to a certain degree by the
    v6ops working group, which did not include oversight of the 6bone in
    its charter. Therefore it is assumed that it is appropriate to use
    the IETF Best Current Practice (BCP) RFC process to determine a 6bone
    phaseout plan, as well as an appropriate way to get community
    feedback on the specifics of the 6bone phaseout.

    This plan for a 6bone phaseout specifies a multi-year phaseout
    timeline to allow sufficient time for continuing operation of the
    6bone, followed by a sufficient time for 6bone participants to
    convert to production IPv6 address prefixes allocated by the relevant
    Regional Internet Registry (RIR), National Internet Registry, or
    Local Internet Registries (ISPs).

    It is anticipated that under this phaseout plan the 6bone will cease
    to operate by June 6, 2006, with all 6bone prefixes fully reclaimed
    by the IANA.

    This document is intended to obsolete RFC 2471, "IPv6 Testing Address
    Allocation", December, 1998.  RFC 2471 will become historic.


2.0 6bone Phaseout Plan

    To provide for the continuing useful operation of the 6bone, to the
    extent that IETF consensus judges it to be useful, 6bone top level
    address prefixes known as pseudo TLA's (pTLAs) MAY continue to be
    allocated until January 1, 2004.

INTERNET-DRAFT             6bone Phaseout Plan                 June 2003


    Thus after the pTLA allocation cutoff date January 1, 2004, it is
    REQUIRED that no new 6bone 3FFE pTLAs be allocated.

    To provide for sufficient planning time for 6bone participants to
    convert to production IPv6 address prefixes, all 6bone prefixes
    allocated by the cutoff time specified above, except for allocations
    withdrawn as a matter of 6bone operating procedures, SHALL remain
    valid until June 6, 2006.

    Thus after the 6bone phaseout date June 6, 2006, it is REQUIRED that
    no 6bone 3FFE prefixes, of any size/length, be used on the Internet
    in any form.

    It should be noted that this RFC does not intend to imply that a
    6bone prefix holder, whether at the pTLA top level or lower, should
    seek a production IPv6 address prefix at any specific level. It may
    be entirely reasonable for a 6bone prefix holder to seek a higher
    level, or a lower level, IPv6 prefix as their specific needs dictate.

5.0 Security Considerations

    This document defines a phaseout plan for the usage of the IPv6
    Testing Address Allocation [TEST-NEW], which uses addresses
    consistent with [AGGR].  It does not have any direct impact on
    Internet infrastructure security.


6.0 IANA Considerations

    This document defines a phaseout plan for the usage of the IPv6
    Testing Address Allocation [TEST-NEW]. The IANA MUST reclaim the
    3FFE::/16 prefix upon the date specified in 2.0.

    When the 6bone Testing Address Allocation is reclaimed by the IANA,
    it is expected that many network operators will filter it on their
    borders to ensure it is not misused.

    There is experience from the IPv4 world that such filters may not be
    removed promptly should this address space be reallocated, and it is
    recommended that the IANA bears this in mind before reallocating it
    in a manner that would require it to be routed globally within the
    current Internet.
