Internet-Draft    SIP RPH Namespace for Local Emergencies      Mar 2009

   Protocol (SIP) Resource Priority header (RPH) namespace "esnet" for 
   local emergency usage.  The SIP Resource-Priority header is defined 
   in RFC 4412 [RFC4412]. This new namespace is to be used within 
   public safety answering point (PSAP) networks.  This new namespace 
   can be used for inbound calls towards PSAPs, between PSAPs, and 
   between a PSAP and first responders or their organizations.  

   Within controlled environments, such as an IMS infrastructure or 
   Emergency Services network (ESInet), where misuse can be reduced to 
   a minimum because these types of networks have great controls in 
   place, this namespace can be to provide an explicit priority 
   indication that facilitates differing treatment of emergency SIP 
   messages according to local policy, or more likely, a contractual 
   agreement between the network organizations.  This indication is 
   used to differentiate SIP requests, or dialogs, from other requests 
   or dialogs that do not have the need for priority treatment.

   It can also be imagined that Voice Service Providers (VSP) directly 
   attached to an ESInet can have a trust relationship with the ESInet 
   such that within these networks, SIP requests (thereby the session 
   they establish) make use of this "esnet" namespace for appropriate 
   treatment.

   Usage of the "esnet" namespace is to be defined in a future 
   document(s). This document merely creates the namespace, per the 
   rules within [RFC4412], necessitating a Standards Track RFC for 
   IANA registering new RPH namespaces and their relative 
   priority-value order.      

   There is a possibility that within emergency services networks, a 
   Multilevel Precedence and Preemption (MLPP)-like behavior can be 
   achieved (likely without the 'preemption' part, which will always be 
   a matter of local policy, and not defined here) - ensuring more 
   important calls are established or retained, the "esnet" namespace 
   is given 5 priority-levels.  MLPP-like SIP signaling is not defined 
   in this document for 911/112/999 style emergency calling, but it is 
   not prevented either.

   Within the ESINet, there will be emergency calls requiring different
   treatments, according to the type of call.  Does a citizen's call to
   a PSAP require the same, a higher or a lower relative priority than 
   a PSAP's call to a police department, or the police chief?  What 
   about either relative to a call from within the ESINet to a 
   federal government's department of national security, such as the US
   Department of Homeland Security?  For this reason, the "esnet" 
   namespace is given multiple priority levels.

   This document does not define any of these behaviors, outside of 
   reminding readers that the rules of RFC 4412 apply - though examples
   of usage are included for completeness.  This document IANA 
   registers the "esnet" RPH namespace for use within emergency 
   services networks, not just of those from citizens to PSAPs.

2.  Rules of Usage of the Resource Priority Header

   This document updates the behaviors of the SIP Resource Priority 
   header, defined in [RFC4412], during the treatment options 
   surrounding this new "esnet" namespace only. The usage of the 
   "esnet" namespace does not have a 'normal', or routine call level, 
   given the environment this is to be used within (i.e., within an 
   ESInet).  That is for local jurisdictions to define within their 
   respective parts of the ESInet- which could be islands of local 
   administration.  

   RFC4412 states that modifying the relative priority ordering or the 
   number of priority-values to a registered namespace is not 
   recommended across the same administrative domain, due to 
   interoperability issues with dissimilar implementations. 

   Every use of this namespace will be in times of an emergency, where 
   at least one end of the signaling is within a local emergency 
   organization.

   The "esnet" namespace has 5 priority-values, in a specified relative 
   priority order, and is a queue-based treatment namespace [RFC4412]. 
   Individual jurisdictions MAY configure their SIP entities for 
   preemption treatment, but this is optional, and a local policy 
   decision.

   Conceivably, this could be an example network diagram where the 
   "esnet" namespace is used:

       Figure 1: Where 'esnet' Namespace Can or Will be used

   In Figure 1., the "esnet" namespace is intended for usage within the
   ESInet on the right side of the diagram.  How it is specifically 
   utilized is out of scope for this document, and left to local 
   jurisdictions to define.  Adjacent VSPs to the ESInet MAY have a 
   trust relationship that includes allowing this/these neighboring 
   VSP(s) to use the "esnet" namespace to differentiate SIP requests 
   and dialogs within the VSP's network.  The exact mapping between the 
   internal and external sides of the edge proxy at the ESInet 
   boundaries is out of scope of this document.

   To be clear, the use of an edge proxy in any network, the rules 
   within the document that create a (i.e., each) namespace apply, and 
   because the "esnet" namespace is allowed to be modified or deleted 


Polk                      Expires Sept 24, 2009                [Page 5]
Internet-Draft    SIP RPH Namespace for Local Emergencies      Mar 2009

   at the edge proxy of the ESInet does not allow any edge proxy to 
   modify or delete any other Resource-Priority namespace.  This 
   document's target market is for the "esnet" namespace only.


3.  "esnet" Namespace Definition

   One thing to keep in mind for now is the fact that this namespace 
   is not to be considered just "EMERGENCY" because there are a lot of 
   different kinds of emergencies, some on a military scale ([RFC4412] 
   defines 3 of these), some on a national scale ([RFC4412] defines 2 
   of these), some on an international scale.  These types of 
   emergencies can also have their own namespaces, and although there 
   are 5 defined for other uses, more are possible - so the 911/112/999
   style of public user emergency calling for police or fire or 
   ambulance (etc) does not have a monopoly on the word "emergency".

   Therefore, the namespace "esnet" has been chosen, as it is most 
   recognizable as that of citizen's call for help from a public 
   authority type of organization.  This namespace will also be used 
   for communications between emergency authorities, and MAY be used 
   for emergency authorities calling public citizens.  An example of 
   the later is a PSAP operator calling back someone who previously 
   called 9111/112/999 and the communication was terminated before it 
   should have been (in the operator's judgment).

   Here is an example of a Resource-Priority header using the esnet 
   namespace:

      Resource-Priority: esnet.0

3.1.  Namespace Definition Rules and Guidelines

   This specification defines one unique namespace for emergency 
   calling scenarios, "esnet", constituting its registration with IANA. 
   This IANA registration contains the facets defined in Section 9 of 
   [RFC4412].  

3.2.  The "esnet" Namespace

   Per the rules of [RFC4412], each namespace has a finite set of 
   relative priority-value(s), listed (below) from lowest priority to 
   highest priority.  In an attempt to not limit this namespace's use 
   in the future, more than one priority-value is assigned to the 
   "esnet" namespace.  This document does not RECOMMEND which 
   priority-value is used where.  That is for another document to 
   specify.  This document does RECOMMEND the choice within a national 
   jurisdiction is coordinated by all sub-jurisdictions to maintain 
   uniform SIP behavior throughout an emergency calling system.

   The relative priority order for the "esnet" namespace is as follows:



Polk                      Expires Sept 24, 2009                [Page 6]
Internet-Draft    SIP RPH Namespace for Local Emergencies      Mar 2009


      (lowest)  esnet.0
                esnet.1
                esnet.2
                esnet.3
      (highest) esnet.4

   The "esnet" namespace will be assigned into the priority queuing 
   algorithm (Section 4.5.2 of [RFC4412]) from the public user to the 
   PSAP.  This does not limit its usage to only the priority queue 
   algorithm; meaning the preemption algorithm is a policy decision for
   local jurisdictions.  This document is not RECOMMENDING this 
   usage, merely pointing out those behaviors is a matter of local 
   policy.

   The rules originated in RFC 4412 remain with regard to an RP actor, 
   who understands more than one namespace, MUST maintain its locally 
   significant relative priority order.

   NOTE: at this time, there has not been sufficient discussion about 
   whether or not preemption will be used for communications between 
   PSAPs or between PSAPs and First responders (and their 
   organizations).


4.  IANA Considerations

4.1  IANA Resource-Priority Namespace Registration

   Within the "Resource-Priority Namespaces" of the sip-parameters 
   section of IANA (created by [RFC4412]), the following entries will 
   be added to this table:

                        Intended      New warn-   New resp.
   Namespace  Levels    Algorithm     code        code      Reference
   ---------  ------  --------------  ---------   --------- ---------
     esnet      5        queue           no          no     [This doc]


4.2  IANA Priority-Value Registrations

   Within the Resource-Priority Priority-values registry of the 
   sip-parameters section of IANA, the following (below) is to be added 
   to the table:

   Namespace: esnet
   Reference: (this document)
   Priority-Values (least to greatest): "0", "1","2", "3", "4"

Internet-Draft    SIP RPH Namespace for Local Emergencies      Mar 2009

5.  Security Considerations

   The Security considerations that apply to RFC 4412 [RFC4412] apply 
   here.  

   The implications of using this header-value incorrectly can cause a 
   large impact on a network - given that this indication is to give 
   preferential treatment of marked traffic great preference within the
   network than other traffic.  This document does not indicate this 
   marking is intended for use by endpoints, yet protections need to be
   taken to prevent granting preferential treatment to unauthorized 
   users not calling for emergency help.  

   A simple means of preventing this usage into an ESInet is to not 
   allow "esnet" marked traffic to get preferential treatment unless 
   the destination is towards the local/regional ESInet.  This is not a
   consideration for internetwork traffic within the ESInet, or 
   generated out of the ESInet.  911/112/999 type of calling is fairly 
   local in nature, with a finite number of URIs that are considered 
   valid.
