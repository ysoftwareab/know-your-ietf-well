                  Abstract  
                   
                  There is no requirement for identities identities asserted by a UA in 
                  a SIP message to be anything other than the userÆs desired alias. An 
                  authenticated identity of a user can be obtained using SIP Digest 
                  authentication, however it is unlikely that the necessary Public Key 
                  Infrastructure to facilitate this for UAs will be available soon. 
                   
                  A Network Asserted Identity is an identity initially derived by a SIP 
                  network intermediary as a result of an authentication process. This 
                  draft describes short term requirements for the exchange of Network 
                  Asserted Identities within networks of securely interconnected 
                  trusted nodes and to User Agents securely connected to such networks. 
                   
                  General requirements for transport of Network Asserted Identities on 
                  the Internet are out of scope of this draft.

               1. Introduction 
                   
                  SIP [1] allows users to assert their identity in a number of ways 
                  e.g. using the From: header. However, there is no requirement for 
                  these identities to be anything other than the users desired alias. 
                   
                  An authenticated identity of a user can be obtained using SIP Digest 
                  Authentication (or by other means). However, it is unlikely that the 
                  necessary Public Key Infrastructure to globally facilitate this for 
                  users will be available soon. 
                   
                  A Network Asserted Identity is an identity initially derived by a SIP 
                  network intermediary as a result of an authentication process. This 
                  may or may not be based on SIP Digest authentication. This draft 
                  describes short term requirements for the exchange of Network 
                  Asserted Identities within networks of securely interconnected 
                  trusted nodes and also to User Agents with secure connections to such 
                  networks. 
                   
                  Such a network is described in this draft as a Trust Domain and we 
                  present a strict definition of trust and Trust Domain for the 
                  purposes of this draft. These short-term requirements provide only 
                  for the exchange of Network Asserted Identitied within a Trust 
                  Domain.

               Network Asserted Identity û short term requirements           May 2002 
                
                
                  General requirements for transport of Network Asserted Identities on 
                  the Internet are out of scope of this draft. 
                       
               2. Definitions 
                   
               2.1 Identity 
                   
                  An Identity, for the purposes of this draft, is a URI, and optionally 
                  a Display Name. The URI MUST be meaningful to the domain identified 
                  in the URI when used as a SIP Request-URI. 
                   
                  If the URI is a sip: or sips: URI, then depending on the local policy 
                  of the domain identified in the URI, the URI MAY identify some 
                  specific entity, such as a person. 
                   
                  If the URI is a tel: URI, then depending on the local policy of the 
                  owner of the number range within which the telephone number lies, the 
                  number MAY identify some specific entity, such as a telephone line. 
                  However, it should be noted that identifying the owner of the number 
                  range is a less straightforward process than identifying the domain 
                  which owns a sip: or sips: URI. 
                   
               2.2 Network Asserted Identity 
                   
                  A Network Asserted Identity is an identity derived by a SIP network 
                  entity as a result of an authentication process. 
                   
                  The authentication process used, or at least itÆs 
                  reliability/strength, is a known feature of the Trust Domain using 
                  the Network Asserted Identity mechanism i.e. in the language of 2.3 
                  below, it is defined in Spec(T). 
                   
               2.3 Trust Domains  
                   
                  A Trust Domain for the purposes of Network Asserted Identity is a set 
                  of SIP nodes (UAC, UAS, proxies or other network intermediaries) that 
                  are trusted to exchange Network  Asserted Identity information in the 
                  sense described below. 
                   
                  A node can be a member of a Trust Domain, T, only if the node is know 
                  to be compliant to a certain set of specifications, Spec(T), which 
                  characterize the handling of Network Asserted Identity within the 
                  Trust Domain, T. 
                   
                  Trust Domains are constructed by human beings who know the properties 
                  of the equipment they are using/deploying. In the simplest case, a 
                  Trust Domain is a set of devices with a single owner/operator who can 
                  accurately know the behaviour of those devices.

                  Such simple Trust Domains may be joined into larger Trust Domains by 
                  bi-lateral agreements between the owners/operators of the devices. 
                   
                  We say a node is ætrustedÆ (with respect to a given Trust Domain) if 
                  and only if it is a member of that domain. 
                   
                  We say that one node in the domain is ætrusted byÆ another if and 
                  only if: 
                   
                  (i) there is a secure connection between the nodes, AND 
                  (ii) they have configuration information to indicate that they are 
                  members of the same Trust Domain. 
                   
                  This most often applies to network intermediaries such as proxies in 
                  the Trust Domain. 
                   
                  A æsecure connectionÆ in this context means that messages cannot be 
                  read by third parties and cannot be modified or inserted by third 
                  parties without detection. The level of security required is a 
                  feature of the Trust Domain i.e. it is defined in Spec(T). 
                   
                  We say that a node, A, in the domain is ætrusted byÆ a node, B, 
                  outside the domain if and only if: 
                   
                  (i) there is a secure connection between the nodes, AND 
                  (ii) B has configuration information indicating that A is a member of 
                  the Trust Domain. 
                   
                  This most often applies to a UA which trusts a given network 
                  intermediary (e.g. its home proxy). 
                   
                  The term ætrustedÆ (with respect to a given Trust Domain) can be 
                  applied to a given node in an absolute sense û it is just equivalent 
                  to saying the node is a member of the Trust Domain. However, the node 
                  itself does not know whether another arbitrary node is ætrustedÆ, 
                  even within the Trust Domain. It does know about certain nodes with 
                  which it has secure connections as described above. 
                   
                  With the definition above, statements such as æA trusted node SHALL 
                  ...Æ are just shorthand for æA node compliant to this specification 
                  SHALL...Æ. 
                   
                  Statements such as æWhen a node receives information from a trusted 
                  node...Æ are NOT valid, because one node does not have complete 
                  knowledge about all the other nodes in the trust domain. 
                   
                  Statements such as æWhen a node receives information from another 
                  node that it trusts...Æ ARE valid, and should be interpreted 
                  according to the criteria (i) and (ii) above.

               Network Asserted Identity û short term requirements           May 2002 
                
                
                   
                  Within this context, SIP signaling information received by one node 
                  FROM a node that it trusts is known to have been generated and passed 
                  through the network according to the procedures of the particular 
                  specification set Spec(T), and therefore can be known to be valid, or 
                  at least as valid as specified in the specifications Spec(T). 
                   
                  Equally, a node can be sure that signaling information passed TO a 
                  node that it trusts will be handled according to the procedures of 
                  Spec(T). 
                   
                  For these capabilities to be useful, Spec(T) must contain 
                  requirements as to how the Network Asserted Identity is generated, 
                  how its privacy is protected and how its integrity is maintained as 
                  it is passed around the network. A reader of Spec(T) can then make an 
                  informed judgement about the authenticity and reliability of Network 
                  Asserted Information received from the Trust Domain T. 
                   
               3. Generation of Network Asserted Identity 
                
                  A Network Asserted Identity is generated by a network intermediary 
                  following an Authentication process which authenticates the entity 
                  (UA) to be identified. 
                   
                  The Authentication process(es) used are a characteristic feature of 
                  the Trust Domain, and MUST be specified in Spec(T). 
                   
                  It shall be possible for a UA to provide a prefered identity to the 
                  network intermediary, which MAY be used to inform the generation of 
                  the Network Asserted Identity according to the policies of the Trust 
                  Domain. 
                   
               4. Transport of Network Asserted Identity 
                   
               4.1 Sending of Network Asserted Identity within a Trust Domain 
                   
                  It shall be possible for one node within a Trust Domain to securely 
                  send a Network Asserted Identity to another node that it trusts. 
                   
               4.2 Receiving of Network Asserted Identity withing a Trust Domain 
                   
                  It shall be possible for one node within a Trust Domain to receive a 
                  Network Asserted identity from another node that it trusts. 
                   
               4.3 Sending of Network Asserted Identity to entities outside a Trust 
                   Domain 
                   
                  It shall be possible for a node within the Trust Domain to securely 
                  send a Network Asserted Identity to a node outside the trust domain.

                  This is most often used to pass a Network Asserted Identity directly 
                  to a UA. 
                   
               4.4 Receiving of Network Asserted Identity by a node outside the Trust 
                   Domain 
                   
                  It shall be possible for a node outside the Trust Domain to receive a 
                  Network Asserted Identity from a node that it trusts. 
                   
                  Network Asserted Identity received in this way may be considered 
                  valid, and used for display to the user, input data for services etc. 
                   
                  Network Asserted Identity information received by one node from a 
                  node which it does not trust carries no guarantee of authenticity or 
                  integrity because it is not known that the procedures of Spec(T) were 
                  followed to generate and transport the information. Such information 
                  MUST NOT be used. i.e. it shall not be displayed to the user, passed 
                  to other nodes, used as input data for services etc. 
                   
                   
               5. Parties with Network Asserted Identities 
                
                  A Network Asserted Identity identifies the originator of the message 
                  in which it was received. 
                   
                  For example,  
                   
                     o a Network Asserted Identity received in an initial INVITE 
                        (outside the context of any existing dialog) identifies the 
                        calling party. 
                      
                     o a Network Asserted Identity received in a 180 Ringing response 
                        to such an INVITE identifies the party who is ringing. 
                      
                     o a Network Asserted Identity received in a 200 response to such 
                        an INVITE identifies the party who has answered. 
                   
                   
               6. Types of Network Asserted Identity 
                   
                  Each party shall have at most one Network Asserted Identity. 
                   
                  It shall be possible for the capability to transport multiple 
                  identities associated with a single party to be introduced in future. 
                   
               7. Privacy of Network Asserted Identity

                  The means by which any privacy requirements in respect of the Network 
                  Asserted Identity are determined are outside the scope of this draft. 
                   
                  It shall be possible to indicate that a Network Asserted Identity is 
                  subject to a privacy requirement which prevents it being passed to 
                  other users.  
                   
                  In this case, the Network Asserted Identity specification shall 
                  require that the mechanism of 3.2 SHALL NOT be used i.e. a trusted 
                  node shall not pass the identity to a node it does not trust. 
                  However, the mechanism of 3.1 MAY be used to transfer the identity 
                  within the trusted network. 
                   
                  It shall be possible to indicate whether the Network Asserted 
                  Identity is private due to a request from the user/subscriber or for 
                  another reason. 
                   
                  Note that æanonymityÆ requests from users or subscribers may well 
                  require functionality in addition to the above handling of Network 
                  Asserted Identities. Such additional functionality is out of the 
                  scope of this document. 
                   
               8. Next steps 
                   
                   
                  It is proposed to use draft-jennings-sipping-nai-00 [2] to implement 
                  the requirements of this draft. 
                   
               9. Security considerations 
                   
                  The requirements in this draft are NOT intended to result in a 
                  mechanism with general applicability between arbitrary hosts on the 
                  Internet. 
                   
                  Rather, the intention is to state requirements for a mechanism to be 
                  used within a community of devices which are known to obey the 
                  specification of the mechanism (Spec(T)) and between which there are 
                  secure connections. Such a community is known here as a Trust Domain. 
                   
                  The requirements on the mechanisms used for security and to initially 
                  derive the Network Asserted Identity must be part of the 
                  specification Spec(T). 
                   
                  Such devices may be hosts on the Internet. 
                   
                  The requirements also support the transfer of information from a node 
                  within the Trust Domain, via a secure connection to a node outside 
                  the Trust Domain.

                  Use of this mechanism in any other context has serious security 
                  shortcomings, namely that there is absolutely no guarantee that the 
                  information has not been modified, or was even correct in the first 
                  place.
