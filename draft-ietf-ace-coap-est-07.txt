                    EST over secure CoAP (EST-coaps)
                       draft-ietf-ace-coap-est-07

Abstract

   Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) is used as a certificate
   provisioning protocol over HTTPS.  Low-resource devices often use the
   lightweight Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) for message
   exchanges.  This document defines how to transport EST payloads over
   secure CoAP (EST-coaps), which allows constrained devices to use
   existing EST functionality for provisioning certificates.

2.  Introduction

   "Classical" Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) [RFC7030] is used
   for authenticated/authorized endpoint certificate enrollment (and
   optionally key provisioning) through a Certificate Authority (CA) or
   Registration Authority (RA).  EST messages run over HTTPS.

   This document defines a new transport for EST based on the
   Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) since some Internet of Things
   (IoT) devices use CoAP instead of HTTP.  Therefore, this
   specification utilizes DTLS [RFC6347], CoAP [RFC7252], and UDP
   instead of TLS [RFC8446], HTTP [RFC7230] and TCP.

   EST responses can be relatively large and for this reason this
   specification also uses CoAP Block-Wise Transfer [RFC7959] to offer a
   fragmentation mechanism of EST messages at the CoAP layer.

   This document also profiles the use of EST to only support
   certificate-based client authentication.  HTTP Basic or Digest
   authentication (as described in Section 3.2.3 of [RFC7030] are not
   supported.

3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Many of the concepts in this document are taken over from [RFC7030].
   Consequently, much text is directly traceable to [RFC7030].  The same
   document structure is followed to point out the differences and
   commonalities between EST and EST-coaps.

4.  Conformance to RFC7925 profiles

   This section shows how EST-coaps fits into the profiles of low-
   resource devices described in [RFC7925].  EST-coaps can transport
   certificates and private keys.  Certificates are responses to
   (re-)enrollment requests or requests for a trusted certificate list.
   Private keys can be transported as responses to a server-side key
   generation request as described in section 4.4 of [RFC7030] snd
   discussed in Section 5.7 of this document.

   As per Sections 3.3 and 4.4 of [RFC7925], the mandatory cipher suite
   for DTLS in EST-coaps is TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8
   [RFC7251].  Curve secp256r1 MUST be supported [RFC8422]; this curve
   is equivalent to the NIST P-256 curve.  Crypto agility is important,
   and the recommendations in [RFC7925] section 4.4 and any updates to
   RFC7925 concerning Curve25519 and other CFRG curves also apply.

   DTLS1.2 implementations MUST use the Supported Elliptic Curves and
   Supported Point Formats Extensions [RFC8422].  Uncompressed point
   format MUST also be supported.  [RFC6090] can be used as summary of
   the ECC algorithms.  DTLS 1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13] implementations
   differ from DTLS 1.2 because they do not support point format
   negotiation in favor of a single point format for each curve and thus
   support for DTLS 1.3 does not mandate point formation extensions and
   negotiation.

   The authentication of the EST-coaps server by the EST-coaps client is
   based on certificate authentication in the DTLS handshake.  The EST-
   coaps client MUST be configured with at least an Implicit TA database
   from its manufacturer which will allow for the authenticating the
   server the first time before updating its trust anchor (Explicit TA)
   [RFC7030].

   The authentication of the EST-coaps client is based on a client
   certificate in the DTLS handshake.  This can either be

   o  a previously issued client certificate (e.g., an existing
      certificate issued by the EST CA); this could be a common case for
      simple reenrollment of clients.

   o  a previously installed certificate (e.g., manufacturer-installed
      IDevID (IEEE 802.1AR [ieee802.1ar] certificate or a certificate
      issued by some other party); the server is expected to trust the
      previously installed CA certificate in this case.  IDevID's are
      expected to have a very long life, as long as the device, but
      under some conditions could expire.  In the latter case, the
      server MAY want to authenticate a client certificate against its
      trust store although the certificate is expired (Section 11).

Internet-Draft                  EST-coaps                   January 2019


   Client authentication via DTLS Client Certificate is mandatory.

5.  Protocol Design

   EST-coaps uses CoAP to transfer EST messages, aided by Block-Wise
   Transfer [RFC7959] to transport CoAP messages in blocks thus avoiding
   (excessive) fragmentation of UDP datagrams.  The use of "Block" for
   the transfer of larger EST messages is specified in Section 5.5.
   Figure 1 below shows the layered EST-coaps architecture.

   +------------------------------------------------+
   |    EST request/response messages               |
   +------------------------------------------------+
   |    CoAP for message transfer and signalling    |
   +------------------------------------------------+
   |    DTLS for transport security                 |
   +------------------------------------------------+
   |    UDP for transport                           |
   +------------------------------------------------+

                    Figure 1: EST-coaps protocol layers

   The EST-coaps protocol design follows closely the EST design.  The
   actions supported by EST-coaps are identified by their message types:

   o  CA certificate retrieval, needed to receive the complete set of CA
      certificates.

   o  Simple enroll and reenroll, for CA to sign public client-identity
      key.

   o  Certificate Signing Request (CSR) Attributes request messages,
      informs the client of the fields to include in generated CSR.

   o  Server-side key generation messages, to provide a private client-
      identity key when the client choses for an external entity to
      generate its private key.

5.1.  Mandatory/optional EST Functions

   This specification contains a set of required-to-implement functions,
   optional functions, and not specified functions.  The latter ones are
   deemed too expensive for low-resource devices in payload and
   calculation times.

   Table 1 specifies the mandatory-to-implement or optional
   implementation of the est-coaps functions.

              | /simplereenroll  | MUST                     |

              | /serverkeygen    | OPTIONAL                 |
              | /csrattrs        | OPTIONAL                 |
              +------------------+--------------------------+

               Table 1: Table 1: List of EST-coaps fuctions

   While [RFC7030] permits a number of these functions to be used
   without authentication, this specification requires authentication
   for all functions.

5.2.  Payload format

   The content-format (media type equivalent) of the CoAP message
   determines which EST message is transported in the CoAP payload.  The
   media types specified in the HTTP Content-Type header (section 3.2.2
   of [RFC7030]) are in EST-coaps specified by the Content-Format Option
   (12) of CoAP.  The combination of URI path and content-format in EST-
   coaps MUST map to an allowed combination of URI and media type in
   EST.  The required content-formats for these requests and response
   messages are defined in Section 10.1.  The CoAP response codes are
   defined in Section 5.4.

   EST-coaps is designed for use between low-resource devices and hence
   does not need to send Base64-encoded data.  Simple binary is more
   efficient (30% smaller payload) and well supported by CoAP.  Thus,
   the payload for a given media type follows the ASN.1 structure of the
   media-type and is transported in binary DER format.  Section 5.2.1
   specifies the payload structure when multiple media types are present
   in the payload.

5.2.1.  Content Format application/multipart-core

   A representation with content format ID 62 contains a collection of
   representations along with their respective content format.  The
   content-format identifies the media-type application/multipart-core
   specified in [I-D.ietf-core-multipart-ct].

   The collection is encoded as a CBOR array [RFC7049] with an even
   number of elements.  The second, fourth, sixth, etc. element is a
   binary string containing a representation.  The first, third, fifth,
   etc. element is an unsigned integer specifying the content format ID

Internet-Draft                  EST-coaps                   January 2019


   of the consecutive representation.  For example, a collection
   containing two representations in response to a server-side key
   generation request, could include a private key in PKCS#8 [RFC5958]
   with content format ID 284 (0x011C) and a certificate with content
   format ID 281 (0x0119).  Such a collection would look like
   [284,h'0123456789abcdef', 281,h'fedcba9876543210'] in diagnostic CBOR
   notation.  The serialization of such CBOR content would be


      84                  # array(4)
      19 011C             # unsigned(284)
      48                  # bytes(8)
         0123456789ABCDEF # "\x01#Eg\x89\xAB\xCD\xEF"
      19 0119             # unsigned(281)
      48                  # bytes(8)
         FEDCBA9876543210 # "\xFE\xDC\xBA\x98vT2\x10"

                   Multipart /skg response serialization

   The PKCS#8 key and X.509 certificate representations are ASN.1
   encoded in binary DER format.  An example is shown in Appendix A.4.

   In cases where the private key is further encrypted with CMS (as
   explained in Section 5.7) the content format ID is 280 (0x0118).

5.3.  Message Bindings

   The general EST CoAP message characteristics are:

   o  All EST-coaps messages expect a response from the server, thus the
      client MUST send the requests over confirmable CON CoAP messages.

   o  The Ver, TKL, Token, and Message ID values of the CoAP header are
      not affected by EST.

   o  The CoAP options used are Uri-Host, Uri-Path, Uri-Port, Content-
      Format, and Location-Path.  These CoAP Options are used to
      communicate the HTTP fields specified in the EST REST messages.

   o  EST URLs are HTTPS based (https://), in CoAP these are assumed to
      be translated to coaps (coaps://)

   Appendix A includes some practical examples of EST messages
   translated to CoAP.

5.4.  CoAP response codes

   Section 5.9 of [RFC7252] and Section 7 of [RFC8075] specify the
   mapping of HTTP response codes to CoAP response codes.  Every time
   the HTTP response code 200 is specified in [RFC7030] in response to a
   GET request (/cacerts, /csrattrs), in EST-coaps the equivalent CoAP
   response code 2.05 or 2.03 MUST be used.  Similarly, 2.01, 2.02 or
   2.04 MUST be used in response to HTTP POST EST requests
   (/simpleenroll, /simplereenroll, /serverkeygen ).  Response code HTTP
   202 Retry-After that existed in EST has no equivalent in CoAP.
   Section 5.6 specifies how EST requests over CoAP handle delayed
   messages.

   EST makes use of HTTP 204 and 404 responses when a resource is not
   available for the client.  The equivalent CoAP error code to use in
   an EST-coaps responses are 2.04 and 4.04.  Additionally, EST's HTTP
   401 error translates to 4.01 in EST-coaps.  Other EST HTTP error
   messages are 400, 423 and 503.  Their equivalent CoAP errors are
   4.00, 4.03 and 5.03 respectively.  In case a required COAP option
   (i.e Content-Format) is omitted, the server is expected to return a
   4.02.

5.5.  Message fragmentation

   DTLS defines fragmentation only for the handshake and not for secure
   data exchange (DTLS records).  [RFC6347] states that to avoid using
   IP fragmentation, which involves error-prone datagram reconstitution,
   invokers of the DTLS record layer SHOULD size DTLS records so that
   they fit within any Path MTU estimates obtained from the record
   layer.  In addition, invokers residing on a 6LoWPAN over IEEE
   802.15.4 [ieee802.15.4] network SHOULD attempt to size CoAP messages
   such that each DTLS record will fit within one or two IEEE 802.15.4
   frames.

   That is not always possible in EST-coaps.  Even though ECC
   certificates are small in size, they can vary greatly based on
   signature algorithms, key sizes, and OID fields used.  For 256-bit
   curves, common ECDSA cert sizes are 500-1000 bytes which could
   fluctuate further based on the algorithms, OIDs, SANs and cert
   fields.  For 384-bit curves, ECDSA certs increase in size and can
   sometimes reach 1.5KB.  Additionally, there are times when the EST
   cacerts response from the server can include multiple certs that
   amount to large payloads.  Section 4.6 of CoAP [RFC7252] describes
   the possible payload sizes: "if nothing is known about the size of
   the headers, good upper bounds are 1152 bytes for the message size
   and 1024 bytes for the payload size".  Section 4.6 of [RFC7252] also
   suggests that IPv4 implementations may want to limit themselves to
   more conservative IPv4 datagram sizes such as 576 bytes.  Even with



van der Stok, et al.      Expires July 13, 2019                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft                  EST-coaps                   January 2019


   ECC certs, EST-coaps messages can still exceed MTU sizes on the
   Internet or 6LoWPAN [RFC4919] (Section 2 of [RFC7959]).  EST-coaps
   needs to be able to fragment messages into multiple DTLS datagrams.

   To perform fragmentation in CoAP, [RFC7959] specifies the "Block1"
   option for fragmentation of the request payload and the "Block2"
   option for fragmentation of the return payload of a CoAP flow.  As
   explained in Section 1 of [RFC7959], blockwise transfers SHOULD be
   used in Confirmable CoAP messages to avoid the exacerbation of lost
   blocks.  [RFC7959] defines SZX in the block option fields.  SZX is
   used to convey the size of the blocks in the requests or responses.
   The CoAP client MAY specify the Block1 size and MAY also specify the
   Block2 size.  The CoAP server MAY specify the Block2 size, but not
   the Block1 size.

   [RFC7959] also defines Size1 and Size2 options to provide size
   information about the resource representation in a request and
   response.  The Size1 response MAY be parsed by the client as a size
   indication of the Block2 resource in the server response or by the
   server as a request for a size estimate by the client.  Similarly,
   the Size2 option defined in BLOCK should be parsed by the server as
   an indication of the size of the resource carried in Block1 options
   and by the client as a maximum size expected in the 4.13 (Request
   Entity Too Large) response to a request.

   Examples of fragmented EST messages are shown in Appendix B.

5.6.  Delayed Responses

   Server responses can sometimes be delayed.  According to section
   5.2.2 of [RFC7252], a slow server can acknowledge the request with a
   2.31 code and respond later with the requested resource
   representation.  In particular, a slow server can respond to an
   enrollment request with an empty ACK with code 0.00, before sending
   the certificate to the server after a short delay.  If the
   certificate response is large, the server will need more than one
   "Block2" blocks to transfer it.  This situation is shown in Figure 2
   where a client sends an enrollment request that uses more than one
   "Block1" blocks.  The server uses an empty 0.00 ACK to announce the
   delayed response which is provided later with 2.04 messages
   containing "Block2" options.  Having received the first 256 bytes in
   the first "block2" block, the client asks for a block reduction to
   128 bytes in all following "block2" blocks, starting with the second
   block (NUM=1).

               Figure 2: EST-COAP enrolment with short wait

   If the server is very slow (i.e. minutes) in providing the response
   (i.e. when a manual intervention is needed), the server SHOULD
   respond with an ACK containing response code 5.03 (Service
   unavailable) and a Max-Age option to indicate the time the client
   SHOULD wait to request the content later.  After a delay of Max-Age,
   the client SHOULD resend the identical CSR to the server.  As long as
   the server responds with response code 5.03 (Service Unavailable)
   with a Max-Age option, the client can resend the enrolment request
   until the server responds with the certificate or the client abandons
   for other reasons.

   To demonstrate this scenario, Figure 3 shows a client sending an
   enrolment request that uses more than one "Block1" blocks to send the
   CSR to the server.  The server needs more than one "Block2" blocks to
   respond, but also needs to take a long delay (minutes) to provide the
   response.  Consequently, the server uses a 5.03 ACK response with a
   Max-Age option.  The client waits for a period of Max-Age as many
   times as he receives the same 5.03 response and retransmits the
   enrollment request until he receives a certificate.  Note that in the
   example below the server asks for a decrease in the block size when
   acknowledging the first Block2.

5.7.  Server-side Key Generation

   Constrained devices sometimes do not have the necessary hardware to
   generate statistically random numbers for private keys and DTLS
   ephemeral keys.  Past experience has also shown that low-resource
   endpoints sometimes generate numbers which could allow someone to
   decrypt the communication or guess the private key and impersonate as
   the device [PsQs] [RSAorig].

   Additionally, random number key generation is costly, thus energy
   draining.  Even though the random numbers that constitute the
   identity/cert do not get generated often, an endpoint may not want to
   spend time and energy generating keypairs, and just ask for one from
   the server.

   In these scenarios, server-side key generation can be used.  The
   client asks for the server or proxy to generate the private key and
   the certificate which is transferred back to the client in the
   server-side key generation response.  In all respects, the server
   SHOULD treat the CSR as it would treat any enroll or re-enroll CSR;
   the only distinction here is that the server MUST ignore the public



van der Stok, et al.      Expires July 13, 2019                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft                  EST-coaps                   January 2019


   key values and signature in the CSR.  These are included in the
   request only to allow re-use of existing codebases for generating and
   parsing such requests.

   [RFC7030] recommends the private key returned by the server to be
   encrypted.  This specification provides two methods to encrypt the
   generated key, symmetric and asymmetric.  The methods are signalled
   by the client by using the relevant attributes (SMIMECapabilities and
   DecryptKeyIdentifier or AsymmetricDecryptKeyIdentifier) in the CSR
   request.  The symmetric key or the asymmetric keypair establishment
   method is out of scope of this specification.

   The sever-side key generation response is returned using a CBOR array
   Section 5.2.1.  The certificate part exactly matches the response
   from an enrollment response.  The private key can be in unprotected
   PKCS#8 [RFC5958] format (content type 281) or protected inside of CMS
   SignedData (content type 280).  The SignedData is signed by the party
   that generated the private key, which may or may not be the EST
   server or the EST CA.  The SignedData is further protected by placing
   it inside of a CMS EnvelopedData as explained in Section 4.4.2 of
   [RFC7030].  In summary, the symmetricly encrypted key is included in
   the encryptedKey attribute in a KEKRecipientInfo structure.  In the
   case where the asymmetric encryption key is suitable for transport
   key operations the generated private key is encrypted with a
   symmetric key which is encrypted by using the client defined (in the
   CSR) asymmetric public key and is carried in an encryptedKey
   attribute in a KeyTransRecipientInfo.  Finally, if the asymmetric
   encryption key is suitable for key agreement, the generated private
   key is encrypted with a symmetric key which is encrypted by using the
   client defined (in the CSR) asymmetric public key and is carried in
   an recipientEncryptedKeys attribute in a KeyAgreeRecipientInfo.

   [RFC7030] recommends the use of additional encryption of the returned
   private key.  For the context of this specification, clients and
   servers that choose to support server-side key generation MUST
   support unprotected (PKCS#8) private keys (content type 281).
   Symmetric or asymmetric encryption of the private key (CMS
   EnvelopedData, content type 280) SHOULD be supported for deployments
   where end-to-end encryption needs to be provided between the client
   and a server.  Such cases could include architectures where an entity
   between the client and the CA terminates the DTLS connection
   (Registrar in Figure 4).

5.8.  Deployment limits

   Although EST-coaps paves the way for the utilization of EST by
   constrained devices in constrained networks, some classes of devices
   [RFC7228] will not have enough resources to handle the large payloads



van der Stok, et al.      Expires July 13, 2019                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                  EST-coaps                   January 2019


   that come with EST-coaps.  The specification of EST-coaps is intended
   to ensure that EST works for networks of constrained devices that
   choose to limit their communications stack to UDP/DTLS/CoAP.  It is
   up to the network designer to decide which devices execute the EST
   protocol and which do not.

6.  Discovery and URIs

   EST-coaps is targeted for low-resource networks with small packets.
   Saving header space is important and short EST-coaps URIs are
   specified in this document.  These URIs are shorter than the ones in
   [RFC7030].  The EST-coaps resource path names are:

   coaps://example.com:<port>/.well-known/est/<short-est>
   coaps://example.com:<port>/.well-known/est/ArbitraryLabel/<short-est>

   The short-est strings are defined in Table 2.  The ArbitraryLabel
   Path-Segment, if used, SHOULD be of the shortest length possible
   (Sections 3.1 and 3.2.2 of [RFC7030].  Following [RFC7030] discovery
   is not needed when the client is preconfigured with the /.well-known/
   est server URI and the coaps port 5684.

   The EST-coaps server URIs, obtained through discovery of the EST-
   coaps root resource(s) as shown below, are of the form:

   coaps://example.com:<port>/<root-resource>/<short-est>
   coaps://example.com:<port>/<root-resource>/ArbitraryLabel/<short-est>

   Figure 5 in section 3.2.2 of [RFC7030] enumerates the operations and
   corresponding paths which are supported by EST.  Table 2 provides the
   mapping from the EST URI path to the shorter EST-coaps URI path.

                     +------------------+-----------+
                     | EST              | EST-coaps |

                Table 2: Table 2: Short EST-coaps URI path

   Clients and servers MUST support the short resource URIs.  The
   corresponding longer URIs from [RFC7030] MAY be supported.

   In the context of CoAP, the presence and location of (path to) the
   management data are discovered by sending a GET request to "/.well-
   known/core" including a resource type (RT) parameter with the value
   "ace.est" [RFC6690].  Upon success, the return payload will contain
   the root resource of the EST resources.  The server MAY return all
   available resource paths and the used content types.  This is useful
   when multiple content types are supported by the EST-coaps server and
   optional functions are available.  The example below shows the
   discovery of the presence and location of EST-coaps resources.
   Linefeeds are included only for readability.

     REQ: GET /.well-known/core?rt=ace.est*

     RES: 2.05 Content
   </est>; rt="ace.est",
   </est/crts>;rt="ace.est.crts";ct=281,
   </est/sen>;rt="ace.est.sen";ct=281 286,
   </est/sren>;rt="ace.est.sren";ct=281 286,
   </est/att>;rt="ace.est.att";ct=285,
   </est/skg>;rt="ace.est.skg";ct=280 286 62

   The first line of the discovery response above MUST be included.  The
   five consecutive lines after the first MAY be included.  The return
   of the content-types allows the client to choose the most appropriate
   one from multiple content types.

   Port numbers, not returned in the example, are assumed to be the
   default numbers 5683 and 5684 for coap and coaps respectively
   (Sections 12.6 and 12.7 of [RFC7252]).  Discoverable port numbers MAY
   be returned in the <href> of the payload.

   It is up to the implementation to choose its root resource;
   throughout this document the example root resource /est is used.

7.  DTLS Transport Protocol

   EST-coaps depends on a secure transport mechanism over UDP that
   secures the exchanged CoAP messages.  DTLS is one such secure
   protocol.  Where TLS is used in the context of EST, it is understood
   that EST-coaps uses DTLS instead.  No other changes are necessary
   regarding the secure transport of EST messages (all provisional modes
   etc. are the same as in TLS).

   CoAP was designed to avoid fragmentation.  DTLS is used to secure
   CoAP messages.  However, fragmentation is still possible at the DTLS
   layer during the DTLS handshake when using ECC ciphersuites.  If
   fragmentation is necessary, "DTLS provides a mechanism for
   fragmenting a handshake message over several records, each of which



van der Stok, et al.      Expires July 13, 2019                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft                  EST-coaps                   January 2019


   can be transmitted separately, thus avoiding IP fragmentation"
   [RFC6347].

   The DTLS handshake is authenticated by using certificates.  EST-coaps
   supports the certificate types and Trust Anchors (TA) that are
   specified for EST in Section 3 of [RFC7030].

   CoAP and DTLS can provide proof-of-identity for EST-coaps clients and
   servers with simple PKI messages as descrbed in Section 3.1 of
   [RFC5272].  Moreover, channel-binding information for linking proof-
   of-identity with connection-based proof-of-possession is OPTIONAL for
   EST-coaps.  When proof-of-possession is desired, a set of actions are
   required regarding the use of tls-unique, described in section 3.5 in
   [RFC7030].  The tls-unique information consists of the contents of
   the first "Finished" message in the (D)TLS handshake between server
   and client [RFC5929].  The client is supposed to add this "Finished"
   message as a ChallengePassword in the attributes section of the
   PKCS#10 Request [RFC5967] Info to prove that the client is indeed in
   control of the private key at the time of the (D)TLS session
   establishment.  In the case of EST-coaps, the same operations can be
   performed during the DTLS handshake.  For DTLS 1.2, in the event of
   handshake message fragmentation, the Hash of the handshake messages
   used in the MAC calculation of the Finished message MUST be computed
   as if each handshake message had been sent as a single fragment
   [RFC6347].  The Finished message is calculated as:

   PRF(master_secret, finished_label, Hash(handshake_messages))
      [0..verify_data_length-1];

   Similarly, for DTLS 1.3, the Finished message MUST be computed as if
   each handshake message had been sent as a single fragment following
   the algorithm described in 4.4.4 of [RFC8446].  The Finished message
   is calculated as:

   HMAC(finished_key,
       Transcript-Hash(Handshake Context,
       Certificate*, CertificateVerify*))

       * Only included if present.

   In a constrained CoAP environment, endpoints can't afford to
   establish a DTLS connection for every EST transaction.
   Authenticating and negotiating DTLS keys requires resources on low-
   end endpoints and consumes valuable bandwidth.  The DTLS connection
   SHOULD remain open for sequential EST transactions.  For example, an
   EST cacerts request that is followed by a simpleenroll request can
   use the same authenticated DTLS connection.  However, some additional




van der Stok, et al.      Expires July 13, 2019                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft                  EST-coaps                   January 2019


   security considerations apply regarding the use of the Implicit and
   Explicit TA database (Section 11.1)

   Given that after a successful enrollment, it is more likely that a
   new EST transaction will take place after a significant amount of
   time, the DTLS connections SHOULD only be kept alive for EST messages
   that are relatively close to each other.  In some cases like NAT
   rebinding, keeping the state of a connection is not possible when
   devices sleep for extended periods of time.  In such occasions,
   [I-D.rescorla-tls-dtls-connection-id] negotiates a connection ID that
   can eliminate the need for new handshake and its additional cost.

8.  HTTPS-CoAPS Registrar

   In real-world deployments, the EST server will not always reside
   within the CoAP boundary.  The EST server can exist outside the
   constrained network that supports TLS/HTTP.  In such environments
   EST-coaps is used by the client within the CoAP boundary and TLS is
   used to transport the EST messages outside the CoAP boundary.  A
   Registrar at the edge is required to operate between the CoAP
   environment and the external HTTP network as shown in Figure 4.

       Figure 4: EST-coaps-to-HTTPS Registrar at the CoAP boundary.

   The EST-coaps-to-HTTPS Registrar MUST terminate EST-coaps downstream
   and initiate EST connections over TLS upstream.  The Registrar MUST
   authenticate and OPTIONALLY authorize the clients and it MUST be
   authenticated by the EST server or CA.  The trust relationship
   between the Registrar and the EST server SHOULD be pre-established
   for the Registrar to proxy these connections on behalf of various
   clients.

   When enforcing Proof-of-Possession (POP) linking, the DTLS tls-unique
   value of the (D)TLS session needs to be used to prove that the
   private key corresponding to the public key is in the possession of

   and was used to establish the connection by the client as explained
   in Section 7).  The POP linking information is lost between the EST-
   coaps client and the EST server when a Registrar is present.  The EST
   server becomes aware of the presence of a Registrar from its TLS
   client certificate that includes id-kp-cmcRA [RFC6402] extended key
   usage extension (EKU).  As explained in Section 3.7 of [RFC7030], the
   EST server SHOULD apply an authorization policy consistent with a
   Registrar client.  For example, it could be configured to accept POP
   linking information that does not match the current TLS session
   because the authenticated EST client Registrar has verified this
   information when acting as an EST server.

   For some use cases, clients that leverage server-side key generation
   might prefer for the enrolled keys to be generated by the Registrar
   if the CA does not support server-side key generation.  In these
   cases the Registrar MUST support random number generation using
   proper entropy.  Such Registrar is responsible for generating a new
   CSR signed by a new key which will be returned to the client along
   with the certificate from the CA.

   Table 2 contains the URI mappings between EST-coaps and EST that the
   Registrar MUST adhere to.  Section 5.4 of this specification and
   Section 7 of [RFC8075] define the mappings between EST-coaps and HTTP
   response codes, that determine how the Registrar MUST translate CoAP
   response codes from/to HTTP status codes.  The mapping from CoAP
   Content-Type to HTTP Media-Type is defined in Section 10.1.
   Additionally, a conversion from CBOR major type 2 to Base64 encoding
   MUST take place at the Registrar when server-side key generation is
   supported.  If CMS end-to-end encryption is employed for the private
   key, the encrypted CMS EnvelopedData blob should be included in
   binary in CBOR type 2 downstream to the client.

   Due to fragmentation of large messages into blocks, an EST-coaps-to-
   HTTP Registrar MUST reassemble the BLOCKs before translating the
   binary content to Base64, and consecutively relay the message
   upstream.

   For the discovery of the EST server by the EST client in the CoAP
   environment, the EST-coaps-to-HTTP Registrar MUST announce itself
   according to the rules in Section 6.  The available actions of the
   Registrars MUST be announced with as many resource paths necessary.

   4.7 and 4.8 of [RFC7252].

   EST does not impose any unique parameters that affect the CoAP
   parameters But the CoAP ones could be affecting EST.  For example,
   the processing delay of CAs could be less then 2s, but in this case
   the EST-coaps server should be sending a CoAP ACK every 2s while
   processing.

   The main recommendation, based on experiments, is to follow the
   default CoAP configuration parameters.  However, depending on the
   implementation scenario, retransmissions and timeouts can also occur
   on other networking layers, governed by other configuration
   parameters.

   Some further comments about some specific parameters, mainly from
   Table 2 in [RFC7252]:

   o  NSTART: Limit the number of simultaneous outstanding interactions
      that a client maintains to a given server.  EST-coaps clients
      SHOULD use 1, which is the default.  A EST-coaps client is not
      expected to interact with more than one servers at the same time.

   o  DEFAULT_LEISURE: This setting is only relevant in multicast
      scenarios, outside the scope of EST-coaps.

   o  PROBING_RATE: A parameter which specifies the rate of re-sending
      non-confirmable messages.  The EST messages are defined to be sent
      as CoAP confirmable messages, hence this setting is not
      applicable.

   Finally, the Table 3 parameters in [RFC7252] are mainly derived from
   Table 2.  Directly changing parameters on one table would affect
   parameters on the other.

11.  Security Considerations

11.1.  EST server considerations

   The security considerations of Section 6 of [RFC7030] are only
   partially valid for the purposes of this document.  As HTTP Basic
   Authentication is not supported, the considerations expressed for
   using passwords do not apply.

   Given that the client has only limited resources and may not be able
   to generate sufficiently random keys to encrypt its identity, it is
   possible that the client uses server generated private/public keys.
   The transport of these keys is inherently risky.  Analysis SHOULD be
   done to establish whether server side key generation enhances or
   decreases the probability of identity stealing.

   It is also RECOMMENDED that the Implicit Trust Anchor database used
   for EST server authentication be carefully managed to reduce the
   chance of a third-party CA with poor certification practices from
   being trusted.  Disabling the Implicit Trust Anchor database after
   successfully receiving the Distribution of CA certificates response
   (Section 4.1.3 of [RFC7030]) limits any risk to the first DTLS
   exchange.  Alternatively, in a persistent DTLS connection where a
   /sen request follows a /crt in the same connection, a client MAY
   choose to keep the connection already authenticated by the Implicit
   TA open for efficiency reasons (Section 7) by assuming that the
   identity of the server is to be trusted.  In that case then the
   Explicit TA MUST be used starting from the next DTLS connection.

   In cases where the IDevID used to authenticate the client is expired
   the server MAY still authenticate the client because IDevIDs are
   expected to live as long as the device itself (Section 4).  In such
   occasions, checking the certificate revocation status or authorizing
   the client using another method is important for the server to ensure
   that the client is to be trusted.

   In accordance with [RFC7030], TLS cipher suites that include
   "_EXPORT_" and "_DES_" in their names MUST NOT be used.  More
   information about recommendations of TLS and DTLS are included in
   [RFC7525].

   As described in CMC, Section 6.7 of [RFC5272], "For keys that can be
   used as signature keys, signing the certification request with the
   private key serves as a POP on that key pair".  The inclusion of tls-
   unique in the certificate request links the proof-of-possession to
   the TLS proof-of-identity.  This implies but does not prove that only
   the authenticated client currently has access to the private key.

   Regarding the Certificate Signing Request (CSR), an adversary could
   exclude attributes that a server may want, include attributes that a
   server may not want, and render meaningless other attributes that a
   server may want.  The CA is expected to be able to enforce policies
   to recover from improper CSR requests.

   Interpreters of ASN.1 structures should be aware of the use of
   invalid ASN.1 length fields and should take appropriate measures to
   guard against buffer overflows, stack overruns in particular, and
   malicious content in general.

11.2.  HTTPS-CoAPS Registrar considerations

   The Registrar proposed in Section 8 must be deployed with care, and
   only when the recommended connections are impossible.  When POP
   linking is used the Registrar terminating the TLS connection
   establishes a new one with the upstream CA.  Thus, it is impossible
   for POP linking to be enforced end-to-end for the EST transaction.
   The EST server could be configured to accept POP linking information
   that does not match the current TLS session because the authenticated
   EST Registrar client has verified this information when acting as an
   EST server.

   The introduction of an EST-coaps-to-HTTP Registrar assumes the client
   can trust the registrar using its implicit or explicit TA database.
   It also assumes the Registrar has a trust relationship with the
   upstream EST server in order to act on behalf of the clients.  When a
   client uses the Implicit TA database for certificate validation, he
   SHOULD confirm if the server is acting as an RA by the presence of
   the id-kp-cmcRA [RFC6402] EKU in the server certificate.  If the
   server certificate does not include the EKU, it is RECOMMENDED that
   the client includes "Linking Identity and POP Information"
   (Section 7) in requests.

   In a server-side key generation case, if no end-to-end encryption is
   used, the Registrar may be able see the private key as it acts as a
   man-in-the-middle.  Thus, the client puts its trust on the Registrar
   not exposing the private key.

   Clients that leverage server-side key generation without end-to-end
   encryption of the private key (Section 5.7 have no knowledge if the
   Registrar will be generating the private key and enrolling the
   certificates with the CA or if the CA will be responsible for
   generating the key.  In such cases, the existence of a Registrar
   requires the client to put its trust on the registrar doing the right
   thing if it is generating the private key.

Appendix A.  EST messages to EST-coaps

   This section shows similar examples to the ones presented in
   Appendix A of [RFC7030].  The payloads in the examples are the hex
   encoded DER binary, generated with 'xxd -p', of the PKI certificates
   created following [I-D.moskowitz-ecdsa-pki].  The payloads are shown
   unencrypted.  In practice the message content would be binary DER
   formatted and transferred over an encrypted DTLS tunnel.  The
   hexadecimal representations in the examples below would NOT be
   transported in hex, but in binary DER.  Hex is used for visualization
   purposes because a binary representation cannot be rendered well in
   text.

   The message content breakdown is presented in Appendix C.

   The corresponding CoAP headers are only shown in Appendix A.1.
   Creating CoAP headers is assumed to be generally understood.

   These examples assume that the resource discovery, returned a short
   base path of "/est".

A.1.  cacerts

   In EST-coaps, a coaps cacerts message can be:

   GET coaps://192.0.2.1:8085/est/crts

   The corresponding CoAP header fields are shown below.  The use of
   block and DTLS are worked out in Appendix B.

   A 2.05 Content response should contain attributes which are relevant
   for the authenticated client.  This example is copied from section
   A.2 in [RFC7030], where the base64 representation is replaced with a
   hexadecimal representation of the equivalent binary DER format.  The
   EST-coaps server returns attributes that the client can ignore if
   they are unknown to him.

A.3.  enroll / reenroll

   During the (re-)enroll exchange the EST-coaps client uses a CSR
   (Content-Format 286) request in the POST request payload.  As shown
   in Appendix C.2, the CSR contains a ChallengePassword which is used
   for POP linking (Section 7).

   After verification of the CSR by the server, a 2.01 Content response
   with the issued certificate will be returned to the client.  As
   described in Section 5.6, if the server is not able to provide a
   response immediately, it sends an empty ACK with response code 5.03
   (Service Unavailable) and the Max-Age option.  See Figure 3 for an
   example exchange.

   The breakdown of the request and response is shown in Appendix C.3

Appendix B.  EST-coaps Block message examples

   Two examples are presented in this section:

   1.  a cacerts exchange shows the use of Block2 and the block headers

   2.  an enroll exchange shows the Block1 and Block2 size negotiation
       for request and response payloads.

   The payloads are shown unencrypted.  In practice the message contents
   would be binary DER formatted and transferred over an encrypted DTLS

   tunnel.  The corresponding CoAP headers are only shown in
   Appendix B.1.  Creating CoAP headers are assumed to be generally
   known.

B.1.  cacerts

   This section provides a detailed example of the messages using DTLS
   and BLOCK option Block2.  The minimum PMTU is 1280 bytes, which is
   the example value assumed for the DTLS datagram size.  The example
   block length is taken as 64 which gives an SZX value of 2.

   The following is an example of a cacerts exchange over DTLS.  The
   content length of the cacerts response in appendix A.1 of [RFC7030]
   contains 639 bytes in binary.  The CoAP message adds around 10 bytes,
   the DTLS record 29 bytes.  To avoid IP fragmentation, the CoAP block
   option is used and an MTU of 127 is assumed to stay within one IEEE
   802.15.4 packet.  To stay below the MTU of 127, the payload is split
   in 9 packets with a payload of 64 bytes each, followed by a last
   tenth packet of 63 bytes.  The client sends an IPv6 packet containing
   the UDP datagram with the DTLS record that encapsulates the CoAP
   request 10 times.  The server returns an IPv6 packet containing the
   UDP datagram with the DTLS record that encapsulates the CoAP
   response.  The CoAP request-response exchange with block option is
   shown below.  Block option is shown in a decomposed way (block-
   option:NUM/M/size) indicating the kind of Block option (2 in this
   case) followed by a colon, and then the block number (NUM), the more
   bit (M = 0 in Block2 response means it is last block), and block size
   with exponent (2**(SZX+4)) separated by slashes.  The Length 64 is
   used with SZX=2 to avoid IP fragmentation.  The CoAP Request is sent
   with confirmable (CON) option and the content format of the response,
   even though not shown, is 281 (application/pkcs7-mime; smime-
   type=certs-only).  The transer of the 11 blocks with partially filled
   block NUM=10 is shown below

B.2.  enroll

   In this example the requested Block2 size of 256 bytes, required by
   the client, is transferred to the server in the very first request
   message.  The block size 256=(2**(SZX+4)) which gives SZX=4.  The
   notation for block numbering is the same as in Appendix B.1.  It is
   assumed that CSR takes N1+1 blocks and the cert response takes N2+1
   blocks.  The header fields and the payload are omitted for brevity.
