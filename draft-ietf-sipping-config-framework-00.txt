Abstract 
    
   This document defines the application of a set of protocols for 
   configuring a SIP user agent.  The SIP user agent must discover how 
   and from where to retrieve its initial configuration and be notified 
   of changes and updates which impact its configuration.  The 
   objective is to define a means for automatically configuring a user 
   agent such that it can be functional without user or administrative 
   intervention.  The framework for discovery, delivery, notification 
   and updates of user agent configuration is defined here.  This 
   framework is also intended to ease ongoing administration, 
   configuration and upgrading of large scale deployments of SIP user 
   agents.  The contents and format of the configuration data to be 
   defined is outside the scope of this document.

                         A Framework for SIP                Feb. 2003
                       User Agent Configuration 
    
1  Overview 
    
   Today all SIP UA vendors use proprietary means of delivering 
   configuration to the UA.  This configuration framework is intended 
   to enable a first phase migration to a standard means of configuring 
   SIP user agents.  It is expected that UA vendors should be able to 
   use this configuration framework as a means of delivering their 
   existing proprietary configuration data profiles (i.e. using their 
   existing proprietary binary or text formats).  This in itself is a 
   tremendous advantage in that a SIP environment can use a single 
   configuration server to deliver configuration data to UAs from 
   multiple vendors.  Follow-on standardization activities can: 1) 
   define a standard format (e.g. XML or name-value pairs [8]) and 2) 
   specify the content (i.e. name the configuration parameters) of the 
   configuration data profiles. 
    
   This document defines a framework which allows SIP user agents (UA) 
   to automatically: 
        - discover a configuration server (Discovery) 
        - enroll with the configuration server (Enrollment) 
        - retrieve configuration data (Configuration Retrieval) 
        - receive notification of configuration changes (Change 
          Notification) 
        - upload configuration data changes back to the server 
          (Configuration Upload) 
    
   The content and format of the data is not defined in this document.  
   It will be defined in configuration data profile(s) in other 
   document(s). The goal of this framework is to satisfy the 
   requirements for configuration delivery defined in [10], [11] and 
   [16] explicitly excluding the requirements which pertain to 
   configuration data profile content and format.  
    
   Discovery is the process by which a UA SHOULD find the address and 
   port at which it SHOULD enroll with the configuration server.  As 
   there is no single discovery mechanism which will work in all 
   network environments, a number of discovery mechanisms are defined 
   with a prescribed order in which the UA SHOULD try them until one 
   succeeds. 
    
   Enrollment is the process by which a UA SHOULD make itself known to 
   the configuration server. In enrolling the UA MUST provide identity 
   information, name requested configuration data profile and supported 
   protocols for configuration retrieval.  It SHOULD also SUBSCRIBE to 
   a mechanism for notification of configuration changes.  As a result 
   of enrollment, the UA receives a URL for each of the configuration 
   data profiles that the configuration server is able to provide.  
   Each profile requires a separate enrollment or SUBSCRIBE session. 
    
   Configuration Retrieval is the process of retrieving the content for 
   each of the configuration data profiles the UA requested.

   Change Notification is the process by which the configuration server 
   notifies the UA that the content of one or more of the configuration 
   data profiles has changed. Subsequently the UA SHOULD retrieve the 
   data profile from the specified URL upon receipt of the change 
   notification. 
    
   Configuration Upload is the process by which a UA or other entity 
   pushes a change to a configuration data profile back up to the 
   configuration server.

   Split the enrollment into a single SUBSCRIBE dialog for each 
   profile.  The 00 draft sent a single SUBSCRIBE listing all of the 
   desired.  These have been split so that each enrollment can be 
   routed differently.  As there is a concept of device specific and

                       User Agent Configuration 
    
   user specific profiles, these may also be managed on separate 
   servers.  For instance in a roaming situation the device might get 
   itÆs configuration from a local server which knows the LAN specific 
   configuration.  At the same time the user specific profiles might 
   come from the userÆs home environment configuration server.' 
    
   Removed the Config-Expires header as it is largely superfluous with 
   the SUBSCRIBE Expires header. 
    
   Eliminated some of the complexity in the discovery mechanism. 
    
   Suggest caching information discovered about a configuration server 
   to avoid an avalanche problem when a whole building full of devices 
   powers up. 
    
   Added the User-Profile From header field parameter so that the 
   device can a request a user specific profile for a user that is 
   different from the deviceÆs default user. 
    
4  Discovery 
    
   The purpose of discovery is to figure out how to address the 
   configuration server so that the device can enroll.  The enrollment 
   process involves sending a SIP SUBSCRIBE.  Prior to this the 
   discovery process must find the address to use in the URL for the 
   URI and To header field.  The URL SHOULD use the user id: 
   sipuaconfig.  From a SIP perspective the configuration server is 
   simply a user agent. By using the well known user id, this makes it 
   easy for proxy servers to be provisioned to route the enrollment 
   requests from devices to the appropriate configuration server for 
   the domain. 
    
   The first time a UA is plugged in it does not know the address or 
   port at which to enroll with the local configuration server.  It 
   must discover this address and port.  A UA SHOULD support all of the 
   listed discovery mechanisms.  It MUST support at least one of them.  
   Once the UA has discovered the address and port and has successfully 
   enrolled with the configuration server, the UA SHOULD cache the 
   address and port to avoid the need to re-discover the configuration 
   server.  However if enrollment, configuration retrieval or 
   configuration upload fails at any time, the UA SHOULD apply the 
   discovery and enrollment process again.  This provides a means for 
   configuration server fail over and load balancing. 
   The UA SHOULD use the following mechanisms to discover the host 
   address and port at which it SHOULD enroll with the configuration 
   server.  Each mechanism should be tried in the following order until 
   an address and port is provided which results in successful 
   enrollment (i.e. the server responds with a successful 2xx class 
   response): 
        - DHCP option for SIP [3] 
        - DNS A record 
        - Multicast 
        - Manual provisioning

                         A Framework for SIP                Feb. 2003
                       User Agent Configuration 
    
    
   The rationale for this order follows.  Assuming that most UAs are 
   going to use DHCP for IP configuration anyway, using a DHCP option 
   is the least costly in terms of lookup time (i.e. no additional 
   messages are required).  Hence DHCP is first.  Multicast is used 
   last of the automated discovery mechanisms as it is the most 
   restricted in terms of network environments that support it.  
   Multicast is included, even though the applicable environments are 
   restricted, as it is the only mechanism that can be used without the 
   support of the local network administrator. 
    
        The phone administrator and the network administrator are often 
        different people and perhaps in different departments. 
    
   The UA implementer MAY provide the user or administrator with the 
   means to change the order in which these mechanisms are tried.  This 
   includes the ability to manually override the discovery process.  
   However by default without user interaction the UA SHOULD use the 
   order listed above. 
    
   Once discovery is successful the device SHOULD persistently cache 
   the address to avoid avalanche problems when a whole building full 
   of devices powers up at once.  The characteristic of the profile may 
   dictate this behavior.  For example device specific profiles may 
   need to change when the device is moved to a different location.  
   User specific profiles may be independent of the LAN, network or 
   device location. 
    
4.1 DHCP Option 
    
It is likely that most UAs in an deployment of any significant size 
will use DHCP for IP configuration.  DHCP becomes a convenient means to 
discover the configuration server address.  In the same DHCP request 
for basic IP configuration, the UA can add the option for SIP[3] [1] to 
the options field.  This indicates a request for the default SIP proxy 
server address and port.  For example if the DHCP option for SIP 
returns an address of sip.acme.com and a port of 5080, the following 
URL is constructed: sip:sipuaconfig@sip.acme.com:5080.  If the proxy 
server address and port is not returned in the DHCP response or the 
server does not respond to the enrollment request with a successful 2xx 
class response, the next discovery mechanism is attempted. 
    
4.2 DNS 
    
   The UA SHOULD construct a fully qualified host name using 
   ôsipuaconfigö as the host and the local domain if defined.  It 
   SHOULD try a DNS A record lookup on the fully qualified host name. 
   If the name resolves in DNS it should then attempt enrollment.  For 
   example the URL constructed in the local domain of acme.com would 
   look like: sip:sipuaconfig@sipuaconfig.acme.com.  If the server does 
   not respond to enrollment with a successful 2xx class response, the 
   next discovery mechanism is attempted.

                       User Agent Configuration 
    
4.3 Multicast 
    
   The enrollment request is sent to the multicast address for SIP 
   registration [6] "sip.mcast.net" (224.0.1.75).  If a server does not 
   respond with a successful 2xx class response to the enrollment 
   request, the next discovery mechanism is attempted. 
    
4.4 Manually Provisioned 
    
   The UA MAY indicate to the user (or administrator) that automatic 
   discovery has failed. The UA SHOULD allow the user or administrator 
   to manually (perhaps using some out of band method e.g. beam, smart 
   card, etc.) enter the configuration server address and port to be 
   used for enrollment. 
    
5  Enrollment and Change Notification 
    
   The enrollment and configuration change notification are paired 
   together and provided via the SIP SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY framework [7]. 
   This document defines the profile on top of the SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY 
   framework [7] for this purpose.   
    
   UA enrollment with the configuration server is accomplished via the 
   SUBSCRIBE request.  A UA MUST enroll with the configuration server 
   prior to retrieving configuration data profiles.  As part of the 
   enrollment the UA MUST identify itself, its configuration retrieval 
   protocol capabilities and configuration data profile requirements.   
    
   The configuration server may use this information to decide how to 
   allocate resources (e.g. load balancing) to support the UA for its 
   specific configuration retrieval needs.  The configuration server 
   may also use the UA enrollment event as the trigger to generate a 
   new set of configuration data for the specific UA (e.g. based upon 
   provisioned defaults and configuration profile context knowledge for 
   the environment).  This allows the configuration server to provide 
   configuration data for a new UA without previously provisioning the 
   specific UA on the server. 
    
   Each profile that the device requires is obtained via a separate 
   enrollment or SUBSCRIBE request and SIP dialog.  That is for each 
   different profile a device enrolls for, a different Call-Id is used.  
   The device names the profile MIME type in the SUBSCRIBE Accept 
   header field.  The configuration server then delivers a URL (through 
   content indirection [15]) at which the device can retrieve the 
   profile in a subsequent NOTIFY request.  Changes to the profile are 
   indicated in additional NOTIFY requests sent from the configuration 
   server. 
    
   The SUBSCRIBE request for enrollment is sent to the address(es) 
   identified in the discovery process until the first successful 2xx 
   class response is received.  As part of the binding of the 
   SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY framework a new MIME type must be named for each

                       User Agent Configuration 
    
   type of profile.  The profile(s) MIME type(s) MUST be included in 
   the SUBSCRIBE Accept header field. 
    
   [Is it ok to allow a single SUBSCRIBE to request multiple profile 
   types in (e.g. for each MIME subtype application/sip-ua-user-profile 
   and application/sip-ua-device-profile)?] 
    
   If enrollment fails (i.e. no 2xx response to SUBSCRIBE), the UA 
   SHOULD re-discover the configuration server address and port as 
   described in section 3. 
    
    
    
5.1 SUBSCRIBE 
    
   The SUBSCRIBE request is used by the UA to enroll in the 
   configuration domain of the configuration server.  It uniquely 
   identifies the UA with vendor, model and serial number information.  
   The UA also MUST specify its capabilities for configuration 
   retrieval. The UA MUST indicate support for content indirection by 
   including the MIME type message/external-body in the SUBSCRIBE 
   Accept header field per [15].   
    
   The configuration server SHOULD not send an error if it is 
   temporarily not able to provide the configuration data profile 
   listed in the SUBSCRIBE request Event header field.  In the first 
   time out of the box case, the SUBSCRIBE dialog may be the only means 
   of communicating with the device as it does not yet have 
   configuration.  The configuration server SHOULD send a 403 response 
   to the SUBSCRIBE if is not willing to provide the requested 
   configuration profile to the device.  The configuration server 
   SHOULD provide the configuration data profile to the UA via content 
   indirection.  If the configuration server sends a 301 Moved 
   Permanently response to the enrollment SUBSCRIBE, the UA SHOULD 
   cache the URL contained in the response Contact header field in 
   place of the address and port found during discovery for future 
   enrollment. 
    
        The device may request many configuration data profiles by 
        sending multiple SUBSCRIBE requests each in a different SIP 
        dialog.  This may be useful if the device requires user 
        specific profiles for multiple users.  In this case the 
        UserProfile parameter would vary for each SUBSCRIBE.  
        Alternately the device may require multiple types of profiles 
        where each SUBSCRIBE would have a different MIME type in the 
        Accept header field. 
    
   The configuration server MAY use the enrollment (SUBSCRIBE request) 
   as the stimulus to generate a new instance of a configuration data 
   profile unique to the UA.  Alternately the configuration server MAY 
   be provisioned ahead of time to know about new UAs and their 
   specific configuration data content (for example based upon serial 
   number, MAC address).

                       User Agent Configuration 
    
    
   The user agent forms the From field in the SUBSCRIBE in one of two 
   ways depending upon the type of profile that it is enrolling to.  If 
   the user agent is enrolling to a device specific profile, the from 
   addr-spec is formed as: sip:<MAC-address>@<local-domain>.  If the 
   user agent is enrolling to a user specific profile the addr-spec is 
   formed as the users address of record.  In this way the identity for 
   which the profile is desired is always specified in the From field. 
    
5.1.1   Additional User Agent Field Parameters 
    
    
    
   When the device first starts up out of the box, it has no user or 
   local configuration.  The device MUST provide a unique identity such 
   that it is possible for the configuration server to generate 
   configuration profile for the device.  The user agent MUST include 
   the User-Agent header in the SUBSCRIBE request.  The following 
   additional User-Agent field parameters are defined for the purpose 
   of identifying the UA device: 
    
   Vendor û a token used to identify the UA vendor name 
    
   Model û a token used to identify the UA hardware/software model 
    
   Version û a token used to identify the firmware/software version 
   currently installed on the UA 
    
   Serial û the token used to identify the serial number for the UA 
    
        Note: on some hardware such as PCs and servers, there may be 
        multiple instances of a user agent installed.  In these 
        scenarios only the serial number can be used to uniquely 
        distinguish instances. 
    
   Mac û the token used to identify the MAC address in hex for the UA 
    
   From RFC 3261 [6] the User-Agent header field syntax is extended to: 
   User-Agent  =  "User-Agent" HCOLON product *( SEMI config-params ) 
    
   config-params = serial-param / mac-param / generic-param 
   product          =  vendor-model [SLASH product-version] 
   product-version  =  token 
   vendor-param  =  ôVendorö ô=ö token 
   serial-param  =  ôSerialö ô=ö token 
   mac-param  =  ôMacö ô=ö token 
    
    
   Example: 
   User-Agent: model-a/1.5.0.1;vendor=acme 
    
   The Vendor, Model, Version, Serial and Mac parameters MUST be 
   provided in the User-Agent header field for the enrollment SUBSCRIBE

   request.  Most profiles will either be device or user specific.  All 
   config-params MUST be specified even when enrolling for user 
   profiles as the device characteristics may impact the content that 
   the profile server provides. 
    
5.2 NOTIFY 
    
   The NOTIFY message is sent by the configuration server to convey the 
   URL at which the UA can retrieve the requested configuration data 
   profile.  This occurs in two contexts: 
    
     Immediately following the enrollment SUBSCRIBE the configuration 
     server MUST send a NOTIFY providing the URL for the configuration 
     data profile requested by the UA in the Event header field of the 
     SUBSCRIBE request.  If the configuration server is not able to 
     provide the specific configuration data profile or it does not 
     want the UA to retrieve the specific configuration profile at that 
     time, it MAY defer sending NOTIFY.  Later when the configuration 
     server is able to provide the data profile or it wishes the UA to 
     retrieve the data profile, the configuration server MAY send a 
     NOTIFY request containing the URL for the configuration data 
     profile which the UA SHOULD retrieve and make effective as soon as 
     it is safe to do so (e.g. when there are no active INVITE 
     dialogs). 
 
     If the configuration server becomes aware of a configuration 
     change that it wishes to be effective immediately on the UA, the 
     configuration server SHOULD send a NOTIFY message containing the 
     URL for the configuration data profile that the UA requested when 
     it enrolled.  The configuration data profile with changed content 
     SHOULD have a different Content-ID entity header than that of the 
     last NOTIFY request.  The UA SHOULD retrieve and make effective 
     the changed configuration URL immediately upon receipt of the 
     NOTIFY request.  The UA MAY choose to wait to make the changes 
     effective (e.g. to prevent the change from disrupting active calls 
     on the UA).  
      
     [Do we need an option for the configuration server to tell the UA 
     that it MUST make the change immediately regardless of state?  
     Should this be the default?] 
      
   The UA SHOULD send a 200 response to the NOTIFY immediately upon 
   receipt and validation of the solicited request.  The configuration 
   server MUST include, in the change notification NOTIFY request,  the  
   configuration data profile URL.  The Content-ID entity header 
   associated with the configuration data profile with changed content 
   should be different than that of the previous NOTIFY.  
     This mechanism may be used by the configuration server to provide 
     firmware updates.  For example on a UA that caches or has a 
     persistent firmware image: if the server realizes (e.g. from the 
     enrollment information) the UA is running the most currently 
     available firmware version, it could defer sending the NOTIFY with 
     the URL for the firmware.  However at a later time when a new

     firmware version is available the configuration server could send 
     a NOTIFY with the URL for the new firmware version, indicating the 
     UA SHOULD upgrade as soon as it is safe to do so. 
      
5.2.1   NOTIFY Body Content Format 
    
The NOTIFY request MUST contain a single part body with content 
indirection [15].  The request MUST have a Content-Type header field 
with the MIME type of message/external-body.  The Content-Type MUST 
also have a URL parameter specifying the URL at which to retrieve the 
profile.  The body MUST contain a Content-Type entity header with the 
MIME type of the profile as the value.  The body MUST also contain a 
Content-ID entity header which SHOULD change to a new unique value each 
time the content of the URL changes.    The Content-ID entity header  
associated with the URL is intended to allow the UA to decide if it has 
the latest content of the configuration data profile without having to 
download and compare the contents. 
 
   Example: 
    
   NOTIFY sip:00df1e004cd0@acme.com SIP/2.0 
   From: sip:sipuaconfig@sipuaconfig.acme.com;tag=1234 
   To: sip:00df1e004cd0@acme.com;tag=abcd 
   Call-ID: 3573853342923422@10.1.1.123 
   CSeq: 2131 INVITE 
   Content-Type: message/external-body; 
                 ACCESS-TYPE=URL; 
                 URL="https://acme.com/profiles/vendor-x/00df1e004cd0" 
   Content-Length: ... 
   Content-Type: application/foo-profile 
   Content-Disposition: session 
   Content-ID: <1000957853@acme.com> 
    
6  Configuration Retrieval 
    
   The UA MUST retrieve its configuration data profile using the URL 
   specified by the configuration server in the NOTIFY request.  If the 
   retrieval fails, the UA SHOULD not re-enroll until the SUBSCRIBE 
   session expires to avoid a cascade effect if the server goes down 
   temporarily.  The device MAY re-try the profile retrieve of the 
   profile from the URL before the SUBSCRIBE expires. Should the re-
   enrollment fail, the UA SHOULD re-discover the configuration server 
   as described in section 4. 
    
7  Configuration Upload 
    
   If the UA or another entity wishes to modify a configuration data 
   profile it MAY make the change persistent on the configuration 
   server if it is authorized to do so.  The configuration server 
   SHOULD support the ability to accept uploads via the same URL the UA 
   used to retrieve the configuration data profile.  For HTTP and HTTPS 
   the UA does a POST with a multipart MIME attachment containing any 
   URL parameters in one part and the changed configuration data

   profile [whole or changes only ?? define in profiles ??] in another 
   part as defined in [?].  If the UA or user is not permitted to make 
   the changes on the configuration server the configuration server 
   returns an HTTP error response code of 403 Forbidden.  If the 
   configuration server returns a 403 the UA SHOULD disallow the 
   changes from being effective on the UA.   The UA SHOULD not make the 
   changes effective until it receives a successful response (e.g. for 
   HTTP 2xx).   
    
   If the URL is for HTTP/HTTPS the server MUST return the changed 
   configuration data profile in the response (assuming it was 
   allowed). The UA SHOULD use the configuration data profile contents 
   from the HTTP response as opposed to the data that was pushed in the 
   request as changes may occur from other sources.  The server SHOULD 
   include a Content-ID header in the HTTP/HTTPS response.  The 
   configuration server SHOULD send out a NOTIFY for this change, using 
   the same Content-ID entity header value as in the HTTP/HTTPS 
   response. This allows the UA to know that it already has the current 
   contents of the configuration data profile and SHOULD not download 
   that configuration data profile (i.e. it is safe to ignore the 
   NOTIFY as the Content-ID is the same). 
    
   [Alteratively the Content-ID could be put in the content as opposed 
   to the HTTP/HTTPS response] 
    
   [TBD û in 403 case restrict and provide feedback as to what 
   specifically is not allowed to be modified by the UA or user] 
 
8  Examples 
    
   Below is an example high level message flow for a new UA discovering 
   and using configuration data from a configuration server.  Following 
   the high level message flows are some specific SIP messages 
   illustrating SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY messages from enrollment and 
   configuration change notification. 
    
8.1 Example Message Flows 
    
   The following high level message flows illustrate the configuration 
   process of discovery, enrollment, configuration retrieval and change 
   notification with associated configuration retrieval.  The UA uses 
   DHCP with the SIP [3] option requesting the configuration server 
   address and port.  The DHCP server does not provide the 
   configuration server address or port.  The UA then does a DNS lookup 
   for the configuration service within the local domain.  It gets a 
   response from the DNS server for the configuration serverÆs fully 
   qualified host name.  The UA then enrolls with the configuration 
   server by sending a SUBSCRIBE request for the profile type indicated 
   in the Event header.  The configuration server sends back a 
   successful response.  The configuration server then sends a NOTIFY 
   request with the URL for the configuration data profile that the UA 
   named in the enrollment SUBSCRIBE request.  The UA sends a 200 
   response to the NOTIFY.  The UA then downloads the configuration

   data profile via the URL from the NOTIFY request.  This process may 
   be repeated in parallel for each of the required profiles.  The UA 
   is now configured as prescribed.   
    
   Later ... an administrator makes a change to the configuration for 
   the UA on the configuration server.  The configuration server on 
   behalf of the administrator, sends a NOTIFY (change notification) 
   request to the UA with Content-ID entity header for the profile.  As 
   the Content-ID value has changed, the UA downloads the configuration 
   data profile from the given URL.

                       User Agent Configuration 
    
   The following SUBSCRIBE request example is from a UA enrolling with 
   a configuration server.  As this SUBSCRIBE request is for 
   configuration enrollment the Event header field contains the token 
   sip-config.  The UA tells the configuration server that it would 
   like the configuration data profile of type: sip-ua-device-config in 
   the Accept header field.  The UA tells the configuration server that 
   it is enrolling for 86400 seconds via the Expires header field.  
   During this period of time the configuration server MUST send a 
   change notification  with the URL for the configuration data profile 
   which changed.  The UA has identified the specifics about itself in 
   the From field addr-spec and User-Agent parameters: Vendor/Model, 
   Version, Serial, Mac.  In this example the UserProfile parameter is 
   not included in the From field as the sip-config profile is device 
   specific not user specific.

9  Security Considerations 
    
   [This section needs to be greatly expanded and elaborated] 
    
   SIP basic and digest authentication [6] MAY be used for 
   SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY messages used for enrollment and configuration 
   change notification.  There is a chicken and egg problem.  Since the

                         A Framework for SIP                Feb. 2003
                       User Agent Configuration 
    
   content of SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY messages are transported in the clear, 
   the credentials that the UA uses in the SUBSCRIBE 401 challenge, or 
   that the configuration server uses in the NOTIFY 401 challenge must 
   be provisioned out of band (i.e. user or administrator manual input, 
   beamed via PDA, smart card, etc.) via a secure means. 
    
   Configuration data profile URLs are communicated in the clear in the 
   NOTIFY requests from the configuration server.  The security risk of 
   unauthorized access of the URL content can be mitigated if the 
   configuration server and UA both support basic authentication and 
   HTTP or HTTPS.  There is a chicken and egg problem here as well 
   since the content of SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY messages are transported in 
   the clear.  Accordingly,the credentials that the UA uses for the 
   HTTP/HTTPS GET/POST 401 challenge must be provisioned out of band 
   (i.e. user or administrator manual input, beamed via PDA, smart 
   card, etc.) via a secure means. 
 
   Using HTTPS over TLS[13] the configuration server MAY request the 
   certificate of the UA [14].  If this level of authentication is 
   desired, the UA vendor SHOULD ship the UA with a digital certificate 
   or provide a means by which this can be installed out of band.  The 
   configuration server MUST be provisioned with the certificates of 
   authority allowed for each model of UA to be supported. 
    
   Using HTTPS the UA MAY request the certificate of the configuration 
   server.  If this level of authentication is desired the UA must be 
   provisioned with the allowed certificate(s) of authority and 
   identities for the configuration server out of band (i.e. user or 
   administrator manual input, beamed via PDA, smart card, etc.) via a 
   secure means. 
 
    
10 Open Issues 
    
    
   [Do we need an option for the configuration server to tell the UA 
   that it MUST make the change immediately regardless of state?  
   Should this be the default?] 
    
   [Upload to configuration server configuration data profiles whole or 
   changes only ?? define in profiles ??]  
    
   [Security considerations section needs much elaboration]
