               1. Introduction 
                   
                  In approach the L3Shim protocol, changes in the addresses that are 
                  used below the shim will be invisible to the upper layers [ID.L3Shim]. 
                  However, upon changing to a new address pair, transport layer 
                  protocol should be notified so that it can perform a slow start, or 
                  some other form of adaptation to the possibly changed conditions.  
                  This is necessary, for instance, when switching from a high-bandwidth 
                  LAN interface to a low bandwidth cellular interface [ID.ARCH]. Also 
                  L3Shim should decide whether have to notify changed locator based on 
                  requirement for application such as guaranteed bandwidth and delay or 
                  not

                  In this draft, we propose the methods to inform locator change from 
                  L3Shim layer to TCP using indirect TCP congestion control. This 
                  mechanism make TCP congestion situation using behavior of L3Shim 
                  layer without correcting conventional TCP. 
                   
                  Next, we describe L3Shim state process by happened the events 
                  referencing [RFC 2960], [ID.HIP]. These kinds of events and progress 
                  state are presented in a single system view. And it will be help to 
                  implement L3Shim functionalities through understanding L3Shim process.   
                   
                   
               2. Vertical layered Communications 
                   
                  The goal of vertical layered communications achieves optimal network 
                  performance to inform cross layers information. In approach L3Shim, 
                  Vertical layered Communications need to notify possible triggers 
                  include failure of upper level keepalive signal to the SHIM layer, 
                  explicit trigger from upper level, ICMP error, and explicit SHIM 
                  level reachability failure [ID.FAIL]. 
                   
                  Vertical layered Communications can be divided by two categorization 
                  based on L3Shim as depict Figure 1.

               2.1 Interaction between L3Shim and TCP or Upper layer 
                   
                  - Signaling from L3Shim to TCP or application 
                   
                  In this categorization, there is consideration that any locator 
                  change in the L3Shim should trigger a notification to the transport 
                  layer protocol. This notification would be used to trigger a 
                  resetting of the TCP congestion state to slow start, corresponding to 
                  the selection of a new network path. However, note that this 
                  notification can not be done in protocol designs where the end points 
                  are not the final hosts, such as where a gateway is used.  
                   
                  Therefore we proposed method to notify to TCP changing locator using 
                  indirect TCP congestion control. The indirect TCP congestion control 
                  triggers TCP congestion control mechanism through L3Shim's action 
                  basically. 
                   
                  At first, the goal of notification to TCP changed any locator is used 
                  to trigger a resetting of the TCP congestion state to slow start. 
                  Therefore we proposed indirect TCP congestion control that is method 
                  to achieve such purpose without notify locator change to TCP directly.

                  When any locator change was occurred, L3Shim should discard the 
                  entire packets from correspondent node during TCP-Congestion-
                  Triggering-Time. Consequently the TCP congestion control mechanism 
                  triggers naturally by this one. The main key point is that how to set 
                  up the time of TCP-Congestion-Triggering-Time enhancing performance. 
                  It can be heuristic setting up the value. 
                   
                  Also, the VALID state, which is one of L3Shim state and is explained 
                  in next chapter, keep up the situation expecting error for 
                  operational primary address pair during Probably-Active-Duration-Time 
                  with indirect TCP Congestion control separately, TCP Congestion 
                  control mechanism should be achieved automatically. 
                   
                  At last, If we can also envision that application would be able to 
                  tell the L3Shim layer that the current connection in unsatisfactory. 
                  This would require an API to be developed. Therefore indirect TCP 
                  congestion control should be running only in case of occurring 
                  unsatisfactory situation. 
                   
                  - Signaling from TCP or Application and Shim

                  rechability. As following protocols exist [ID.FAIL].  
                   O Positive Feedback from upper layer protocols. TCP can indicate to 
                      the L3Shim layer that it is making progress.  
                   O Negative Feedback from upper layer protocols. It is conceivable 
                      that upper layer protocols five an indication of a problem to the 
                      either congestion or lack of connectivity using ECN (Explicit 
                      Congestion Notification) protocol [RFC 3168]. 
                    
                  And as mentioned before, there is a signaling from Application to 
                  Shim to confirm whether current connection is satisfaction or not.

                  This interaction signaling is used to send explicit test message by

               3. L3Shim state process 
                   
                  L3Shim Protocol can be divided by some states through several events 
                  to support IPv6 site Multihoming. During the lifetime of an L3Shim 
                  enabled end node, the endpoint's L3Shim state changed from one stat 
                  to another in response to various events.  
                   
                  In this draft, first we have arranged the events happened lifetime 
                  interval based on timeline. Each of the events are represented by 
                  situations that can happened at endpoint node supported Shim.  
                   
                  These kinds of events and progress state are presented in a single 
                  system view. And it will be help to implement L3Shim functionality 
                  through understanding L3Shim process. 
                   
               3.1 The Events happened by timeline 
                   
                  We firstly put in order several events from start point of time that 
                  the node communicate with other peer since the node did boot up to 
                  close communication including other situation between this such as 
                  shim context establishment complete and address change trigger cause 
                  to happened operational primary address pair outage.

               3.2.1Bootstrap 
                   
                  The L3Shim enabled node manages locally operational addressees 
                  basically for failure detection. The addresses are discovered and 
                  monitored through IPv6 Neighbor Discovery and link layer specific 
                  mechanisms. Therefore when the L3Shim enabled node does boot up,

                                      L3Shim state management              July 2005 
                
                
                  firstly set memory to operate L3Shim functionalities, and then it 
                  collect and manage available addresses' information. 
                   
                  As mentioned the [ID.FAIL], two different granularity levels are 
                  needed for failure detection in address managements. In other words, 
                  a phase of bootstrap only cares for locally operational addresses. 
                  Other functionalities can be operated after establishment L3Shim 
                  association  
                   
               3.2.2Connect Communication Session 
                   
                  The event is speaking for beginning communication through connection 
                  request between Shim enabled node and correspondent peer. In this 
                  Shim6 approach the endpoint identities and the locators are both IP 
                  addresses.  The intention of this approach is to minimize the amount 
                  of change and backward compatibility with L3Shim ?disabled node. 
                  That is to say when communication session is established for the 
                  first time, there is no L3Shim association. 
                   
                  In accordance with beginning communication, the node enables 
                  functionalities for L3Shim, which are loaded memory in the bootstrap. 
                  These functionalities are kept in clearly state. But we do not know 
                  whether the remote peer can support L3Shim or not, other 
                  functionalities can not be operating exception locally operational 
                  addresses administration. 
                   
               3.2.3Shim Context Establishment 
                   
                  The L3Shim enabled node determines the ability of the remote peer to 
                  support the Shim6 protocol via explicit negotiation after complete 
                  communication session.   
                   
                  O If the capability negotiation fails for Shim6 supported.  
                  The Shim6 protocol will continue to operate in a conventional. 
                  Therefore L3Shim functionality ready to operate is lain in the idle 
                  state continuously.  
                   
                  O If the remote host can support L3Shim  
                  [ID.FUNC] notes that once the initial capability exchange has 
                  completed "both ends know a set of locators for the peer that are 
                  acceptable as the source in received packets." The end node makes an 
                  operational address pair, and managed this information. The initial 
                  state of the Shim6 mapping between ULID and locator is a null mapping.  
                   
               3.2.4Doubt Primary Address Pair Failure 
                   
                  L3Shim should check an operational primary address pair's state 
                  through receiving various kinds of feedback or message.

                                      L3Shim state management              July 2005 
                
                
                   
                  Firstly, the L3Shim is receiving Upper level positive indication in 
                  determinate period representing Active-Working-Time. Whenever receive 
                  this feedback, Active-Working-Time do to reset. But when occurred 
                  timeout since the last positive feedback was received, the Doubt 
                  primary address pair failure event happened. 
                   
                  Secondly, when receive TCP negative feedback using such as ECN (The 
                  Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification to IP), this event 
                  happened. Finally, enter upon the state if receive ICMP error message. 
                   
                  Available address pairs are probed connectivity for address change 
                  trigger after this event occurred. But there is no action about 
                  currently operational primary address pair until decided time 
                  (Probably-Active-Duration-Time) passed.  
                   
                  One of the reasons that put off a term of validity as like Probably-
                  Active-Duration-Time is that give upper layer protocols additional 
                  time to provide reachability confirmation in those cases where 
                  Active-Working-Time have passed since the last positive indication 
                  due to lack of recent traffic. And the other is mentioned before at 
                  Section 2.1; the case of Signaling from L3Shim to TCP. 
                   
               3.2.5Explicit Test 
                   
                  More than Probably-Active-Duration-Time has elapsed since the last 
                  positive indication was received, Explicit Test event occurs. L3Shim 
                  should attempt Rechability test about operational primary address 
                  pair immediately. 
                   
               3.2.6Address change trigger 
                
                  If rechabilility test fails, select one of managing available address 
                  pairs and trigger address change. In case of that changed address 
                  pair's bandwidth is bad than previous one, Indirect TCP Congestion 
                  Control mechanism is operated as like mentioned before  
                   
               4. State transition diagram 
                   
                  The L3Shim state diagram illustrates state change progress. There  
                  is not a complete overlap of processing logic here. Especially this 
                  diagram did not present detailed state about Shim context 
                  establishment and address change mechanism. This state diagram 
                  focuses on the situation between complete Shim context establishment 
                  and occurred address change trigger. 
                   
                  The state diagram in the figures below shows the major state 
                  transitions, together with the causing events and resulting actions.

                  O STRAT 
                   
                  When L3Shim enabled node does boot up, initialized L3Shim. 
                  Specifically, Initialized work such as loading L3Shim in memory, is 
                  achieved 
                   
                  O IDLE 
                  The IDLE state is entered upon that the application send packet to a 
                  new peer or indication from a peer wishing to connect to us. But 
                  L3Shim association did not complete yet. Therefore, L3Shim is 
                  operated in idle state that does own all functions so that do clear 
                  until L3Shim association exchanged.  
                   
                  O ACTIVE 
                  This state is completed L3Shim association through L3Shim context 
                  exchange. All of L3Shims?functions operate in this state. In this 
                  Shim6 approach the endpoint identities and the locators are both IP 
                  addresses basically. The initial state of the Shim6 mapping between

                  The end node makes an operational address pair, and managed this 
                  information. We make timer called Active-Working-Time to manage 
                  ACTIVE state continuously. If positive indication from an upper layer 
                  protocol was received within the last Active-working-time, we can 
                  confirm that L3shim operate well. 
                   
                  O VALID 
                  More than Active-working-time has elapsed since the last positive 
                  confirmation was received. Or if node received ICMP error message or 
                  ECN from TCP, L3Shim was entered the VALID state. However receipt of 
                  such a message does not confirm that address pairÆs rechability is 
                  cut off. The means entering the VALID state insures address pairÆs 
                  rechability is verified quickly if the primary address pair is 
                  actually being used. But there is no action about currently 
                  operational primary address pair until decided time (Probably-Active-
                  Duration-Time) passed.   
                   
                  Within this state, L3Shim only manages available address pairs 
                  through probe message to ready to occur address change trigger. 
                  Available address pairs are check and managed through RTT so on. 
                   
                  O PROBE 
                  The Probably-Active-Duration-Time has no sooner elapsed than L3Shim 
                  attempt explicit rechability test about an operational primary 
                  address pair. A rechability confirmation is actively sought by such 
                  as IKEv2 Keepalive mechanism [ID.MOBIKE]. Note that due to

                                      L3Shim state management              July 2005 
                
                
                  potentially asymmetric connectivity, both sides have to perform their 
                  own tests. 
                   
                  O CHANGE 
                  The CHANGE state is entered upon to unsuccessful recahbility 
                  confirmation about operational primary address pair. Then L3Shim 
                  should select preferred address pair for operational primary one 
                  because to verify other available address pairs validity in VALID 
                  state. If Address change is completely, Active-working-Time does 
                  reset, enter ACTIVE state. 
                   
               4.2 Node Behavior 
                   
                  When L3shim enabled node does boot up, entered upon START state. The 
                  node does load L3Shim in memory preparing L3Shim use. If Connect 
                  Communication Session event is happened, L3Shim is operated in IDLE 
                  state that the entire functionalities are clearing until L3Shim 
                  association will be exchanged. If connection request becomes fail, 
                  return by START state again. 
                   
                  The node in IDLE state monitors ICMP error message or Link layer 
                  specific mechanism to gather locally information for failure 
                  detection. 
                   
                  After Connection establishment is completed, L3Shim tries Shim 
                  context exchange to know that remote note have capability L3Shim. If 
                  the remote host can support L3Shim, L3Shim context is exchanged, and 
                  then own full functionalities of L3Shim are actively operating for 
                  the first time. The other side, if the capability negotiation fails 
                  for Shim6 supported, L3Shim functionalities are ready to operate in 
                  IDLE state continuously. 
                   
                  When L3Shim receive Upper level positive indication within Active-
                  Working-Time, it keeps this ACTIVE state resetting Active-Working-
                  Time. While Active-Working-Time have elapsed, positive indication was 
                  not received, enter upon the VALID state. Also the VALID state is 
                  entered upon receiving either ICMP error message or Upper level 
                  negative indication using such as ECN.  
                   
                  However, receipt of such messages does not confirm address pair's 
                  rechability. But there is no action about current operational primary 
                  address pair until decided time (Probably-Active-Duration-Time) 
                  passed. If positive confirmation was received before timeout happened, 
                  return to ACTIVE state.  
                   
                  During VALID state, L3Shim should verify other available address 
                  pairs?rechability through probe message to prepare address change 
                  triggering situation. In the case of SCTP protocol, other available 
                  address pairs are managed through sending heart-beat chunk

                                      L3Shim state management              July 2005 
                
                
                  periodically [RFC 2960]. But L3Shim can verify other available 
                  address pairs?rechability in VALID state only. Consequently 
                  performance degradation by sending frequently test message is reduced. 
                   
                  More than Probably-Active-Duration-Time has elapsed since the last 
                  positive indication was received performed explicit rechability test 
                  immediately. If the explicit rechability test is succeeded, return to 
                  ACTIVE state. On the contrary, if this test is failed, it should be 
                  occurring address change trigger entering CHANGE state. 
                   
                  In the CHANGE state, L3Shim should change an operational primary 
                  address pair to select preferred one of set of available address 
                  pairs. If we will exhaust available address pairs, keep CHANGE sate 
                  until succeed an operational primary pair change. I would think that 
                  this point is related with Pair selection state mechanism in 
                  [ID.FAIL]. The correlations between proposed L3Shim state and Pair 
                  selection state mechanism will be remain to future works. 
                   
                   
               5. Future works 
                   
                  As mentioned before, our proposed L3Shim state process should have a 
                  few collision points with Pair selection state mechanism referred to 
                  [ID.FAIL]. The states from IDLE to CHANGE sate may be seem to be 
                  related with the Pair selection mechanism. Therefore we are going to 
                  look for a way to cooperate with two mechanisms or to clear off 
                  mutual relationship about two mechanisms for future works.
