ABTRACT 
    
  This document proposes some extensions to the "tel" and "fax" Uniform 
  Resource Locators (URLs) for supporting number portability (NP) and 
  freephone service.  Those proposed extensions allow the Session 
  Initiation Protocol (SIP) to carry those URLs or to convert those 
  URLs to the SIP URL so as to support NP and freephone service.  The 
  proposed extensions allow the SIP protocol to be used to derive the 
  routing number for the ported geographical numbers, identify the 
  freephone service provider/carrier or the Plain Old Telephone Service 
  (POTS) number for a freephone number, and carry the NP- and 
  freephone-related information in the SIP messages.

Extension to the "tel" and "fax" URLs to Support         March 1, 2002 
NP and Freephone Service 
 
1. Introduction 
    
   Number portability (NP)[2] allows the telephone subscribers to keep 
   their telephone numbers when they change service provider, move to a 
   new location, or change the subscribed services.  The NP 
   implementations in many countries presently support service provider 
   portability for geographic numbers and non-geographical numbers.  It 
   has been identified that NP has impacts on several works-in-progress 
   at the IETF.  One of the impacts is the need to carry the NP related 
   information in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)[3] INVITE 
   message after the NP database dip has been performed. 
    
   Freephone service allows the called party to pay for the call by 
   using special numbering blocks (e.g., 800, 888 and 877 number blocks 
   in the U.S.) and requiring a translation from the numbers to the 
   Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) numbers.  For countries that 
   support freephone number portability using centralized databases to 
   manage the number porting, the originating network usually performs 
   a database dip to identify the freephone service provider/carrier 
   that serves a particular freephone number so that it can route the 
   freephone call to that freephone service provider/carrier.  If the 
   originating network is the freephone service provider for that 
   freephone number or is authorized by the freephone service 
   provider/carrier for that freephone number, it translates the 
   freephone number to a POTS number or some proprietary routing 
   information based on certain algorithms for call routing. 
    
   This document proposes some extensions to the "tel" and "fax" 
   Uniform Resource Locators (URLs)[4] for supporting NP and freephone 
   service allowing the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to carry 
   those URLs or to convert those URLs to the SIP URL.  The proposed 
   extensions may allow the SIP to be used to derive the routing number 
   for the ported geographical numbers, to identify the freephone 
   service provider/carrier or the Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) 
   number associate with a freephone number, and to carry the NP and 
   freephone-related information in the SIP messages. 
    
   Section 2 below lists the abbreviations used in this document.  
   Sections 3 and 4 describe the need for the extensions to the "tel" 
   and "fax" URLs to support NP and freephone service, and those 
   proposed extensions are detailed in sections 5 and 6.  Section 7 
   gives a few examples as to how those proposed extensions are used.  
   Section 8 discusses the signaling interworking.  Section 9 lists the 
   major changes from the previous version of this document followed by 
   the conclusion.

3. NP Support 
    
   The NP-related information includes the dialed directory number, a 
   routing number, an indicator that indicates whether a query to the 
   NP Database (NPDB) has been performed, and a location number that 
   identifies the location of the originating switch. 
    
   The dialed called party number may be needed at the terminating 
   switch so that the call can be terminated to the called party (e.g., 
   a line card).  The routing number allows the network, either the 
   Global Switched Telephone Network (GSTN) or the Internet Protocol 
   (IP)-based network, to route the call to the network or switch that 
   currently serves the dialed called party number. The NPDB dip 
   indicator informs the network entities downstream towards the 
   terminating network (e.g., the network that currently serves the 
   called party number) that NPDB dip has been performed; therefore, 
   there is no need to dip the NPDB again. 
    
   Since the dialed directory number is already present in the "tel" or 
   "fax" URL before the NPDB dip is performed, it stays at the same 
   place (i.e., right after the "tel:" or "fax:").  Two new parameters 
   are then required to support NP.   
    
   The first parameter "rn," which stands for "routing number," carries 
   the routing number used for call routing.  This parameter can be 
   used to carry any routing number information that is different from 
   the directory number (e.g., carried right after the "tel:") even 
   when NP is not involved. 
    
   The second new parameter "npdi," which stands for "NPDB dip 
   indicator," indicates whether NPDB dip has been performed.

Extension to the "tel" and "fax" URLs to Support         March 1, 2002 
NP and Freephone Service 
 
 
   These two new parameters are added to the "tel" and "fax" URLs 
   following the rules defined for "future-extension" for the "global-
   phone-number" and "local-phone-number." 
    
    
4. Freephone Service Support 
    
   The freephone-related information includes the dialed freephone 
   number, the carrier identification code (CIC) that identifies the 
   freephone service provider/carrier and the translated POTS number. 
    
   The dialed freephone number after number translation may need to be 
   passed to the called party for purposes such as customer account 
   management.  The CIC code is needed to identify the service 
   provider/carrier that is to receive and process the freephone call.  
   The translated POT number identifies the called party that is to 
   receive the call. 
    
   The translated POT number will be placed right after the "tel:" or 
   "fax:" so there is no need for a new parameter to carry it. 
 
   A new parameter "cic," which stands for carrier identification code, 
   identifies the freephone service provider/carrier associated with 
   the freephone number in question.  If a country uses the CIC codes 
   to identify the service providers/carriers that are not limited to 
   the freephone service providers/carriers, this new parameter can 
   also be used to identify those service providers/carriers even when 
   freephone service is not involved.   One example is the CIC dialed 
   by the caller for selecting a specific inter-exchange carrier in the 
   U.S. (e.g., 101XXXX). 
    
   "cic" is added to the "tel" and "fax" URLs following the rules 
   defined for "future-extension" for the "global-phone-number" and 
   "local-phone-number." 
 
    
5. Proposed Extensions to the "tel" URL Scheme 
    
   The following extensions are to be added to "global-phone-number" 
   and "local-phone-number" based on Augmented Backus-Naur Form 
   (ABNF)[5]:  
       
                             *1(";" routing-number) 
                             *1(";" npdb-dip-indicator)  
                             *1(";" carrier-id-code)                                  
    
   The proposed extensions are further described below. 
    
   routing-number          = rn-tag "=" *1("+") rn-ident 
   rn-tag                  = "rn" 
   rn-ident                = *(hex excluding "F" / visual-separator)

Extension to the "tel" and "fax" URLs to Support         March 1, 2002 
NP and Freephone Service 
 
    
   npdi-dip-indicator      = npdi-tag "=" npdi-ident 
   npdi-tag                = "npdi" 
   npdi-ident              = "yes" / "no" 
    
   carrier-id-code         = cic-tag "=" *1("+") cic-ident 
   cic-tag                 = "cic" 
   cic-ident               = *phonedigit 
    
   It is assumed that national routing number may appear with other 
   global-phone-number information and international routing number may 
   appear with other local-phone-number information.  The routing 
   number digit can be any hexadecimal digit except the digit "F." 
    
   The first 1-3 digits in the "cic" identify a country code.  The rest 
   of the digits identify a carrier ID code assigned in that country. 
    
   The "rn," "npdi," and "cic" can appear at most once if present.  The 
   "cic" and/or "rn" may be removed when there is no need to carry it 
   further in the call signaling messages.  For example, when a 
   freephone call reaches the freephone service provider/carrier 
   serving that freephone number, the "cic" may no longer be needed 
   when the call is to be routed to the called party or another 
   network. Whether and when to remove the new parameters proposed in 
   this document are outside the scope of this document. 
    
   When the "rn" is present, the "npdi" may or may not be present.  
   This is because that the routing number may be present independent 
   of NP.  When the "npdi" parameter is not present, it indicates that 
   either NPDB dip has not been performed (equivalent to npdi=no) or NP 
   is not relevant.  If a SIP server is set to perform the NPDB queries 
   and if a received INVITE message does not contain "yes" in the 
   "npdi" parameter, it will perform the NPDB query.  The NPDB query is 
   outside the scope of this document.  The routing number received in 
   the response (plus the "+" and the country code if a national number 
   is received in the response) will replace the routing number in the 
   "rn" parameter if present or will be used by the new "rn" parameter 
   if "rn" parameter is not present.  The "npdi" parameter will be set 
   to "yes" in this case.  The routing number can be a global routing 
   number (e.g., with "+" and the country code plus the national 
   number) or a local (e.g., network-specific) routing number.  It is 
   also possible that the SIP protocol can be used for the NP query.  
   In that case, the response (e.g., 302 Moved) to the SIP message may 
   carry the NP related information in the "tel" or "sip" URL format 
   with the extensions proposed in this document.   
    
   Although it may be very rare but it is possible to have the "cic," 
   "rn" and POTS number all in the same "tel" URL.  When all the three 
   are present, the "cic" is used for call routing.  A new address 
   family in the Telephony Routing Information Protocol (TRIP)[6] has 
   been defined.  When only the "rn" and the POTS number are present, 
   the "rn" is used for making routing decisions (e.g., check against 
   the TRIP routing tables).  If the "cic" and "rn" parameters are not

Extension to the "tel" and "fax" URLs to Support         March 1, 2002 
NP and Freephone Service 
 
   present, the telephone number right after "tel:" is used for call 
   routing.  Please note that specific "cic" values can be reserved to 
   indicate call routing information instead of a valid CIC that is 
   assigned to a carrier.  For example, a "cic" value of "0110" in a 
   response from the freephone database in the U.S. indicates "local, 
   translated number provided."  In this particular case, the "cic" is 
   ignored and the "rn" and the POTS number are used for call routing 
   based on the rules described above. 
    
   The "CIC" in the U.S. currently identifies the inter-exchange 
   carrier that supports the POTS and/or freephone service.  It can be 
   expanded to include VoIP carriers and local exchange carriers in the 
   same country or under the same country code so that all carriers can 
   be identified in the IP domain for routing purpose.  International 
   service providers and carriers can be identified by the E.164 
   country codes for global services and for Networks [7]. 
    
   Please see section 8 for the discussion on the signaling 
   interworking between the GSTN ISUP and SIP (e.g., "sip" or "tel" 
   URL). 
     
 
6. Proposed Extension to the "fax" URL Scheme 
    
   The following extensions are to be added to "global-phone-number" 
   and "local-phone-number" based on Augmented Backus-Naur Form 
   (ABNF)[5]:  
       
                             *1(";" routing-number) 
                             *1(";" npdb-dip-indicator)  
                             *1(";" carrier-id-code)                                  
    
   The proposed extensions are further described below. 
    
   routing-number          = rn-tag "=" *1("+") rn-ident 
   rn-tag                  = "rn" 
   rn-ident                = *(hex excluding "F" / visual-separator) 
 
   npdi-dip-indicator      = npdi-tag "=" npdi-ident 
   npdi-tag                = "npdi" 
   npdi-ident              = "yes" / "no" 
    
   carrier-id-code         = cic-tag "=" *1("+") cic-ident 
   cic-tag                 = "cic" 
   cic-ident               = *phonedigit 
    
   The same discussions in Section 5 also apply to this section.

7. Examples 
 
7.1  NP Examples 
    
   To simply the examples and focus on the "tel" URL in the Request-
   URI, only the key information of the Request-Line in a SIP INVITE 
   message is shown.  A SIP server receives an INVITE message as shown 
   below where +1-202-533-1234 is the dialed called party number and 
   has been ported out of the donor network. 
    
        INVITE tel:+1-202-533-1234  SIP/2.0 
    
   Assume that this SIP server is set to perform the NPDB query.  Since 
   this INVITE message does not contain the "npdi" parameter, this SIP 
   server will perform a NPDB query.  After receiving a successful 
   response back from the queried NPDB, it formulates the following SIP 
   INVITE message: 
    
        INVITE tel:+1-202-533-1234;rn=+1-202-544-0000;   
               npdi=yes SIP/2.0 
    
   This SIP server then uses the "rn" parameter to make the routing 
   decisions (e.g., using the routing number in the "rn" parameter to 
   check against the TRIP tables to determine the terminating GSTN 
   gateway).  
    
   The concept is that the "rn," if present, is used for making routing 
   decisions, and the phone number after "tel:" is used for call 
   routing only if the "rn" is not present. 
    
   If the dialed called party number +1-202-533-1234 is not ported, the 
   outbound SIP INVITE message may look like  
  
        INVITE tel:+1-202-533-1234;npdi=yes SIP/2.0 
 
   Please note that it may be legal to include the "rn" for carrying 
   the called party number in the example described above; however, it 
   is recommended not to include it because the called party number is 
   not the same as the routing number (e.g., the Location Routing 
   Number in the U.S.). 
    
 
7.2  Freephone Service Examples 
    
   To simply the examples and focus on the "tel" URL, only the key 
   information of the Request-Line in a SIP INVITE message is shown.  A 
   SIP proxy server receives a call to a freephone number +1-800-123-
   4567.  After an interrogation with the freephone database, a CIC 
   with a value of =+1-6789 is received ("+1" is added if not present 
   in the response).  The CIC is used to route the freephone call 
   further to the freephone service provider/carrier identified by the 
   CIC.  Assume that the CIC code needs to be sent to the next SIP 
   proxy server, the INVITE message would look like 
  
<draft-yu-tel-url-04>      Expired on August 31, 2002         [Page 7]
Extension to the "tel" and "fax" URLs to Support         March 1, 2002 
NP and Freephone Service 
 
    
        INVITE tel:+1-800-123-4567;cic=+1-6789 SIP/2.0 
 
   If the freephone number is mapped to a POTS number +1-202-256-1234 
   plus a cic of =+1-6789, the INVITE message would look like 
    
        INVITE tel:+1-202-256-1234;cic==+1-6789  SIP/2.0 
    
   Please note that the translated POTS number is placed right after 
   "tel:" after the number translation.   Although the "To" header may 
   contain the freephone number, there are cases where the freephone 
   number (translated-from-number) may need to be passed in the tel URL 
   or sip URL.  It is for further study.   
    
 
7.3  Conversion from "tel" URL to "sip" URL 
    
   The SIP INVITE message contains a "Request-URI" element that is used 
   by the SIP servers for making routing decisions.  As indicated in 
   [3], SIP servers may support Request-URIs with schemes other than 
   "SIP," for example, the "tel" URI scheme.  It is also known that 
   anything that is defined for the "tel" URL can be converted to the 
   SIP URL.  Therefore, the sip URL can automatically support the 
   proposed extensions to the "tel" URL to carry the NP- and freephone-
   related information.  Since the "fax" URL may be used for fax calls, 
   both the "tel" and "fax" URLs need to be enhanced to support NP and 
   freephone service.  Some enhancements to the SIP protocol may be 
   required to fully support the NP and freephone service (e.g., to 
   carry the "cic" information when the user portion does not carry a 
   telephone number).  Those are outside the scope of this document. 
    
   Two examples are shown below to show how a "tel" URL is converted to 
   a "sip" URL. 
    
    
   Example 1: A "tel" URL such as 
    
        tel:+1-202-533-1234;rn=+1-202-544-0000;npdi=yes 
    
   can be converted to a "sip" URL shown below. 
    
        sip:+1-202-533-1234;rn=+1-202-544-0000;      
            npdi=yes@sip.abc.com;user=phone 
    
   Example 2: A "tel" URL such as 
    
        tel:+1-800-123-4567;cic=+1-6789 
    
   can be converted to a "sip" URL shown below. 
    
        sip:+1-800-123-4567;cic=+1-6789@sip.xyz.com;user=phone

8. Interworking Between GSTN ISUP and SIP 
    
   It is possible that interworking between SIP and Signaling System 
   No. 7 (SS7) Integrated Services Digital Network User Part (ISUP) is 
   required at the border between the GSTN and the IP-based network.  
   For SIP to GSTN interworking and depending on the national ISUP 
   support of NP and freephone service, the information in the "tel" 
   URL are mapped/carried in the proper ISUP parameters.  Some possible 
   mapping are briefly described here; however, the exact mapping 
   between the SIP and ISUP are defined by the "SIP for Telephony" 
   (SIP-T)[8,9], a mechanism that uses SIP to facilitate the 
   interconnection of the GSTN with IP.  It is assumed that all the NP- 
   and freephone-related parameters are present to simplify the 
   discussion.  The interworking rules may be different if some 
   parameters are not present. 
    
   For the GSTN in the U.S., the routing number in the "rn" parameter 
   is carried in the ISUP Called Party Number parameter.  The phone 
   number after "tel:" is carried in the ISUP Generic Address Parameter 
   (GAP) as the "ported number."  National numbers are usually carried 
   (e.g., without the "+" and the country code) in the ISUP parameter.  
   The "npdi" parameter that contains "yes" causes the Ported Number 
   Translation Indicator (PNTI) bit in the Forward Call Indicator (FCI) 
   parameter to be set to "1."  If the terminating GSTN supports 
   concatenated routing number and directory number (e.g., in Europe), 
   then the routing number and the POTS number may be concatenated and 
   put in the ISUP Called Party Number parameter.  The Nature of 
   Address value will be set according to the terminating GSTN's 
   ISUP/NP standards (e.g., a special value is assigned to indicate 
   concatenated numbers).  If to be carried further the "cic" can be 
   mapped to the ISUP Carrier Identification Parameter (CIP). 
    
   For GSTN to IP interworking, when the ISUP signaling contains the NP 
   related information, the NP related information is mapped to the 
   "tel" URL.  This happens for domestic calls where the originating 
   GSTN has performed the NPDB query, or for international calls that 
   have arrived at the terminating country's GSTN where that GSTN has 
   performed the NPDB query.  It is assumed that the GSTN routes the 
   call via the IP-based network to the terminating switch or network 
   in the same country, and SIP and ISUP interworking is involved.  For 
   the GSTN in the U.S., the interworking is straightforward.  The PNTI 
   bit in the ISUP FCI parameter of "1" will set "npdi" to "yes," the 
   number in the Called Party Number parameter plus the "+" and the 
   country code, if a global routing number, is carried in the "rn" 
   parameter, and the called party number in the Generic Address 
   Parameter plus the "+" and the country code, if a global phone 
   number, appears after "tel:".  For GSTN that supports concatenated 
   routing number and directory number (e.g., in some European 
   countries), the IP entity that performs the interworking may need to 
   know the routing number used by the GSTN so that the routing number 
   and the directory number in the concatenated format in the ISUP 
   Called Party Number parameter can be separated and transported in 
   the "rn" parameter and after "tel:" by adding the "+" and the

   country code to them if they are global routing number and phone 
   number.  It is also possible to simply put the ISUP Called Party 
   Number (with "+" and country code for a global phone number) after 
   "tel:" without separating out the routing number and POTS number. 
    
   The possible mapping between the American National Standards 
   Institute (ANSI) ISUP and "tel" URL are summarized below.  It is 
   assumed that all the information involved in the discussion is in 
   the signaling message to simplify the discussion.  As indicated 
   earlier, SIP-T is the one that defines the exact mapping.

9. Conclusion 
 
   This Internet Draft proposes some extensions to the "tel" and "fax" 
   URLs described in [4] to allow the SIP protocol to carry the NP- and 
   freephone service-related information in the "tel" and "fax" URLs.  
   There are several places in the SIP messages where URLs can be 
   carried.  For example, each Contact header in the "302 Moved" 
   response can carry one URL.  The extensions proposed in this 
   document also apply to the "tel" or "sip" URL at those places in 
   addition to the SIP Request-URI element.  With those extensions, 
   people surely will come up innovative ways of using SIP to support 
   many of the existing and new services.  If those proposed extensions 
   are agreed, it is proposed to follow the standardization process to 
   issue this document as a RFC. 
    
 
10. Security Considerations 
 
   This document does not introduce new security implications other  
   than those associated with the ôtelö URL [4]. 
    
11. IANA Considerations  
     
   The three extensions proposed in this document should be registered
