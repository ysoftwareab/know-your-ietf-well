Internet-Draft      ANI Options for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6           May 2015


1.  Introduction

   Access network identification (ANI) of a network device has a range
   of applications.  For example the local mobility anchor in a Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 domain is able to provide access network and access
   operator specific handling or policing of the mobile node traffic
   using information about the access network to which the mobile node
   is attached.

   This document specifies Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4
   (DHCPv4) [RFC2131] and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6
   (DHCPv6) [RFC3315] options for access network identification that is
   added by Relay agent in the DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 messages towards the
   Server.

   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) relay agent aware of the
   access network and access operator add this information in the DHCP
   messages.  This information can be used to provide differentiated
   services and policing of traffic based on the access network to which
   a client is attached.  Examples of how this information can be used
   in mobile networks can be found in [RFC6757].

2.  Motivation

   Proxy mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] can be used for supporting network-based
   mobility management in various types of network deployments.  The
   network architectures, such as Service provider Wi-Fi access
   aggregation or, WLAN integrated mobile packet core are examples where
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 is a component of the overall architecture.  Some
   of these architectures require the ability of the local mobility
   anchor (LMA) [RFC5213] to provide differentiated services and
   policing of traffic to the mobile nodes based on the access network
   to which they are attached.  Policy systems in mobility architectures
   such as PCC [TS23203] and ANDSF [TS23402] in 3GPP system allow
   configuration of policy rules with conditions based on the access
   network information.  For example, the service treatment for the
   mobile node's traffic may be different when they are attached to a
   access network owned by the home operator than when owned by a
   roaming partner.  The service treatment can also be different based
   on the configured Service Set Identifiers (SSID) in case of IEEE
   802.11 based access networks.  Other examples of services include the
   operator's ability to apply tariff based on the location.

   The PMIPv6 extension as specified in [RFC6757] defines PMIPv6 options
   to carry access network identifiers in PMIPv6 signaling from Mobile
   Access Gateway (MAG) to LMA.  MAG can learn this information from
   DHCP options as inserted by DHCP Relay agent before MAG.  If MAG
   relays DHCP messages to LMA as specified in [RFC5844] this

Internet-Draft      ANI Options for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6           May 2015


   information can be inserted by MAG towards LMA in the forwarded DHCP
   messages.

   Figure 1 illustrates an example Proxy Mobile IPv6 deployment where
   Access Points (AP) acting as a DHCP relay agent inserts access
   network identifiers in DHCP messages relayed from the connected
   clients.  The mobile access gateway learns this information over DHCP
   and delivers the information elements related to the access network
   to the local mobility anchor over Proxy Mobile IPv6 signaling
   messages.  In this example, the additional information could comprise
   the SSID of the used IEEE 802.11 network and the identities of the
   operators running the IEEE 802.11 access network infrastructure.

      Code of the IANA-maintained Private Enterprise Numbers registry
      [SMI].

4.  DHCPv4 Access-Network-Identifier Option

   The Access Network Identifier carries information to identify the
   access network to which the client is attached.  This information
   includes access technology type, network identifier, and access-
   network operator identifiers.

   Relay agents that include Access Network Identifier information
   include one or more sub-options (see Section 4.1) in the Relay Agent
   Information option [RFC3046].

4.1.  DHCPv4 Access-Network-Identifier Sub-options

   The access network identifier information will be defined in multiple
   sub-options, allocated from the DHCP Relay Agent Sub-Option Codes.

   ANI Sub-options: The ANI Sub-options consists of a sequence of Sub-
   Option Code, Length, and Value tuples for each sub-option, encoded in
   the following manner:

       SubOpt  Len     Sub-option Data
      +------+------+------+------+------+------+--...-+------+
      | code |   N  |  s1  |  s2  |  s3  |  s4  |      |  sN  |
      +------+------+------+------+------+------+--...-+------+

   Subopt code
      The 1-octet code for the sub-options defined in the following
      sections.

   Len

4.3.  DHCPv4 Network-Identifier Sub-options

   These sub-options are used for carrying the name of the access
   network (e.g., a SSID in case of IEEE 802.11 Access Network, or PLMN
   Identifier [TS23003] in case of 3GPP access) and Access Point name to
   which the client is attached.  The format of these sub-options is
   defined the following sections.

4.3.1.  DHCPv4 Network Name Sub-option

       0                   1                   2                   3

      .                     Network Name (e.g., SSID or PLMNID)       .
      .                                                               .
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Subopt Code
      <IANA-2>.

   Length
      The length of the Network Name field.

   Network Name
      The name of the access network to which the mobile node is
      attached.  The encoding MUST be UTF-8 as described in [RFC3629].

      The type of the Network Name is dependent on the access technology
      to which the mobile node is attached.  For IEEE 802.11 based
      networks, the network name will be the SSID of the network.  For
      3GPP access based it is the PLMN Identifier of the access network
      and for 3GPP2 access, the Network Name is the Access Network
      Identifier[ANI].

      When encoding the PLMN Identifier, both the Mobile Network Code
      (MNC) [TS23003] and Mobile Country Code (MCC) [TS23003] MUST be 3
      digits.  If the MNC in use only has 2 digits, then it MUST be
      preceded with a '0'.

      The name of the access point (physical device name) to which the
      mobile node is attached.  This is the identifier that uniquely
      identifies the access point.  While Network Name (e.g., SSID)
      identifies the operator's access network, Access-Point Name
      identifies a specific network device in the network to which the
      mobile node is attached.  In some deployments, the Access-Point
      Name can be set to the string representation of the Media Access
      Control (MAC) address as specified in [RFC6991] mac-address string
      type of the device or some unique identifier that can be used by
      the policy systems in the operator network to unambiguously
      identify the device.  The encoding MUST be UTF-8 as described in
      [RFC3629].

      Realm of the operator (Ex: EXAMPLE.COM).  A (home) realm is the
      administrative domain with which the user or system maintains an
      account relationship.  Realm names are required to be unique, and
      are piggybacked on the administration of the DNS namespace.
      Realms are encoded using a domain name encoding defined in
      [RFC1035].

6.  Relay Agent Behavior

   DHCPv4 Relay Agents MAY include sub-options defined in section 4.2
   through 4.4 in the Relay Agent Information option as defined in
   [RFC3046] before forwarding the DHCP message to provide information




Bhandari, et al.        Expires November 27, 2015              [Page 13]

   about the access network over which DHCP messages from the client is
   received.

   DHCPv6 Relay Agents MAY include options defined in Section 5 in
   Relay-forward message when forwarding any DHCPv6 message type from
   clients to the servers to provide information about the access
   network over which DHCPv6 messages from the client is received.

7.  Server Behavior

   If DHCPv4 server does not understand the option defined in Section 4
   it must ignore the DHCPv4 Access Network Identifier option received.
   If the DHCPv4 server does not understand the received sub-option
   defined in sections 4.1 through 4.4 in the DHCPv4 Relay Agent
   Information option (82) it must ignore those sub-options only.  If
   DHCPv4 Server is able to process the DHCPv4 Access Network Identifier
   sub-options defined in sections 4.1 through 4.4 received in DHCPv4
   Relay Agent Information option, it MAY use this information for
   address pool selection policy decisions as per its configured policy.
   The DHCPv4 server MAY store this information along with the lease for
   logging and audit purpose.  The DHCPv4 server MAY use the sub-options
   defined in sections 4.1 through section 4.4 inserted by the DHCPv4
   relay agent in the Relay Agent Information option based on its
   configured policy.  When generating a response, the server echoes
   back Relay Agent Information options with all received sub-options in
   it, as specified in Section 2.2 of [RFC3046].

   If the DHCPv6 server receives the options defined in Section 5 and is
   configured to store or use the options defined in Section 5, it
   SHOULD look for the DHCPv6 Access Network identifier options in the
   Relay-forward message of the DHCPv6 relay agent(s) based on its
   configured policy.  The server MAY use received ANI options for its
   address pool selection policy decisions as per its configured policy.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign Sub-option codes for the following DHCPv4
   Sub-options from the "DHCP Relay Agent Sub-Option Codes" registry,
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/bootp-dhcp-parameters/bootp-dhcp-

9.  Security Considerations

   Since there is no privacy protection for DHCP messages, an
   eavesdropper who can monitor the link between the DHCP server and
   relay agent can discover access network information.

   [RFC3118] and [RFC3315] describe many of the threats in using DHCP.
   And, [RFC3118] and [RFC3315] each provide a solution, the
   Authentication Option for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 (respectively).  However,
   neither of these options are in active use and therefore are not a
   viable mitigation option.  DHCP itself is inherently unsecure and



Bhandari, et al.        Expires November 27, 2015              [Page 15]

Internet-Draft      ANI Options for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6           May 2015


   thus link-layer confidentiality and integrity protection should be
   employed to reduce the risk of disclosure and tampering.

   It is possible for a rogue DHCP relay agent to insert or overwrite
   with incorrect access network identifier options for malicious
   purposes.  A DHCP client can also pose as a rogue DHCP relay agent by
   sending incorrect access network identifier options.  While the
   introduction of fraudulent DHCP relay agent information options can
   be prevented by a perimeter defense that blocks these options unless
   the DHCP relay agent is trusted, a deeper defense using the
   authentication sub-option for DHCPv4 relay agent information option
   [RFC4030] SHOULD be deployed as well.  DHCP server administrators are
   strongly advised to configure DHCP servers that use this option to
   communicate with their relay agents using IPsec, as described in
   Section 21.1 of [RFC3315].
