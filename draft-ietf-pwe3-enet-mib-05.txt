2 Introduction 
   
  This document describes a model for managing Ethernet pseudo wire 
  services for transmission over a packet Switched Network (PSN). This 
  MIB module is generic and common to all types of PSNs supported in 
  the PWE3 architecture [FRARCH], which describes the transport and 
  encapsulation of L1 and L2 services over supported PSN types. 
   
  In particular, the MIB module associates a port or specific VLANs on 
  top of a physical Ethernet port or a virtual Ethernet interface (for 
  VPLS service) to a point-to-point PW. It is complementary to the 
  [PWMIB], which is used to manage the generic PW parameters common to 
  all service, including all supported PSN types.

3 Terminology 
   
  This document uses terminology from the document describing the PW 
  architecture [FRARCH] and from [PW-ENET]. 
   
   
4 The Internet-Standard Management Framework  
    
  For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current   
  Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of 
  RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
   
  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
  the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally 
  accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). 
  Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the 
  Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a 
  MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 
  58,RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 
  2580 [RFC2580]. 
    
    
5 Feature Checklist 
   
  The PW Ethernet MIB module (PW-ENET-MIB) is designed to satisfy the 
  following requirements and constraints: 
   
   - The MIB module is designed to be work with the PW-MIB [PW-MIB]. 
   
   - The MIB module is independent of the PSN type. 
    
   - The MIB module supports various options for selecting Ethernet 
      packets into the PW. These include port-based PW, VLAN-based PW,  
     VLAN-change and adding or removing VLAN fields between the port 
      to be emulated and the PW. 
   
   - In the case of an MPLS PSN, the MIB module supports the use of 
      multiple PWs to carry the same Ethernet service. These PWs can be 
      used to support L-LSPs or single COS E-LSPs capable PSN, when 
      mapping of the Ethernet PRI bits to the PSN COS is required. 
   
   - The MIB module enables both point-to-point Ethernet services and 
      VPLS services as discussed in the L2VPN working group [VPLS]. 
   
   - The MIB module allows modeling of the PW as an Ethernet virtual 
      port to be managed via existing Ethernet MIBs like Etherlike-MIB 
      [RFC3635]. 
   
   
   
6  PW-MIB usage

                    Management Information Base 


   
  The MIB module structure for defining a PW service is composed of 
  three layers of MIB modules functioning together. This general model 
  is defined in the PWE3 architecture [FRARCH].  The layering model is 
  intended to sufficiently isolate PW services from the underlying PSN 
  layer that carries the emulated service. This is done at the same 
  time as providing a standard means for connecting any supported 
  services to any supported PSNs.  
   
  The first layer known as the service layer contains service-specific 
  modules such as the one defined in this document. These modules 
  define service-specific management objects that interface or 
  collaborate with existing MIB modules for the native version of the 
  service. The service-specific module Ùgluesˆ the standard modules to 
  the PWE3 MIB modules. 
   
  The next layer of the PWE3 MIB framework is the PW MIB module 
  [PWMIB]. This module is used to configure general parameters of PWs 
  that are common to all types of emulated services and PSNs. This 
  layer is connected to the service-specific layer above, and the PSN 
  layer below. 
   
  The PSN layer provides PSN-specific modules for each type of PSN. 
  These modules associate the PW with one or more "tunnels" that carry 
  the service over the PSN. These modules are defined in other 
  documents. This module is used to Ùglueˆ the PW service to the 
  underlying PSN-specific MIB modules. In the case of MPLS, for 
  example, the PW MPLS MIB [PWMPLSMIB] is used to connect the PW 
  service to either the MPLS-LDP [LDPMIB] or MPLS-TE [TEMIB] MIBs. 
   
  [PWTC] defines some of the object types used in these modules. 
   
  The Etherlike-MIB [RFC3635] does not support virtual Ethernet port, 
  however it is sometimes desired to manage the PW as an Ethernet port 
  via the Etherlike-MIB. This MIB module supports an option to 
  recognize the PW as an ifIndex, enabling standard use of the 
  Etherlike-MIB to manage the PW. 
   
   
6.1  PW-ENET-MIB usage 
   
    - The PW table (pwVcTable) is used for all PW types (ATM, FR, 
      Ethernet, SONET, etc.). This table contains high level generic 
      parameters related to the PW creation. A row is typically created 
      by the operator (see [PWMIB] for other options) for each PW 
      service. 
   
    - Based on the PSN type defined for the PW, rows are created in PSN 
      specific module (for example [PWMPLSMIB]) and associated to the 
      pwVcTable by the common pwVcIndex.

                    Management Information Base 


    - If the PW type is Ethernet or EthernetTagged a row is created by 
      the agent in pwVcEnetTable. 
     
    - When using a MPLS PSN, it may be required to separate the same 
      Ethernet services to multiple PW in order to support multiple COS 
      on the same service. In this case, multiple PWs, each with the 
      appropriate COS will be created to the same destination, and 
      classification will be based also on the Ethernet PRI bits 
      marking. The MIB allow any combinations of multiple PRI setting 
      to PSN COS mapping (The exact PSN marking (EXP bits, DSCP etc.) 
      is out of scope of this MIB). In these cases, pwVcEnetTable will 
      hold multiple rows with the same Ethernet port and VLAN mapping, 
      each PW will need to be created separately by the signaling 
      process.  

     
6.2  PW-ENET management model 
   
  The management model for the Ethernet PW is shown in figure 1, and 
  is based on the PW proposed layering [PWARCH].

  In the typical point-to-point service, the object 
  pwVcEnetPortIfIndex associates the physical CE-bound PE port ('o') 
  to the PW (it is allowed to have multiple PWs associated to the same 
  physical port). This MIB module also manages some of the possible 
  operations of the forwarder. 
   
  In some models it is convenient to model the forwarder virtual 
  interface to a PW IWF instance ('+') as an ifIndex. As discussed in

  the [PWMIB], this is possible by using the PW ifType in the ifTable 
  and indicating the ifIndex in the main pwVcTable. In case of 
  Ethernet PW a virtual interface of ifType = etherLike will be 
  assigned on top of the PW interface to enable statistics gathering 
  and statuses and other management configuration tasks via existing 
  tools. This way, the PW instance is managed as virtual Ethernet 
  interface in the PE. 
   
  The model for using the PW in non-point to point applications, such 
  as VPLS are done with the same principle in mind, except that the 
  creation of the tables is related typically to an auto-discovery 
  process. 
   
6.3  Example of MIB usage 
   
  Assume we would like to create a PW of type VLAN between two PEs, 
  for VLAN value 5. 
   
  - Follows the example in [PWMIB], except that the pwVcType is equal 
  ÊethernetTagged∆. 
   
  - The agent creates a row in pwVcEnetTable and pwVcEnetStatsTable 
  for the specified pwVcindex. The pwVcEnetPwInstance is automatically 
  selected by the agent to the value of Ê1∆. 
   
  - The operator fills the following entries in the pwVcEnetTable: 
   
         pwVcEnetPwVlan        5, 
         pwVcEnetVlanMode      noChange, 
         pwVcEnetPortVlan      5, 
   
         pwVcEnetPortIfIndex   1001, 
         pwVcEnetVcIfIndex     0, -- Not managed in the  
                                  -- Etherlike MIB module 
         .. . 
   
  - The PW is ready for forwarding when signaling has been accomplished 
  successfully between the two peers. 
   
   
6.4  Service delimiting modes  
   
  In this section we will describe how the MIB module supports point-
  to-point applications with various VLAN service delimiting options 
  on the physical port and the PW modes and VLAN values. In the VPLS 
  case the PW is attached to a virtual interface that is attached to a 
  bridge or VPLS forwarder, and it is assumed that this bridge 
  function would be responsible for the packet modifications between 
  the physical port or other virtual port and the virtual port the PW 
  is attached to.

                    Management Information Base 


   
  There are 3 main services that are supported by this MIB module. 
   
  1) Port mode: In this mode, the whole traffic from the port is 
  mapped to the PW.  
   
  1a) In the typical application, the packet is sent to the PW as is: 
   
         pwVcEnetPwVlan        4097, 
         pwVcEnetVlanMode      portMode, 
         pwVcEnetPortVlan      4097, 
   
         pwVcType              Ethernet 
   
  1a) It is possible to add a provider tag (value 10 for example) to 
  the packet when it is sent over the PW: 
   
         pwVcEnetPwVlan        10, 
         pwVcEnetVlanMode      addVlan, 
         pwVcEnetPortVlan      4097, 
   
  pwVcType MAY equal ÊEthernet∆ or ÊEthernetTagged∆, ÊEthernetTagged∆ 
  is RECOMMENDED. 
   
  2) Single VLAN: In this mode, only the first VLAN field on the 
  packet from the physical port is the service delimiting tag, as an 
  example VLAN=5. The following options of processing are possible: 
   
  2a) One to one mapping: the service delimiting tag is kept as is on 
  the PW. 
   
         pwVcEnetPwVlan        5, 
         pwVcEnetVlanMode      noChange, 
         pwVcEnetPortVlan      5, 
   
  pwVcType MAY equal ÊEthernet∆ or ÊEthernetTagged∆, ÊEthernetTagged∆ 
  is RECOMMENDED. 
   
  2b) One to one mapping: the service delimiting tag change it∆s value 
  (to value of 6) on the PW. 
   
         pwVcEnetPwVlan        6, 
         pwVcEnetVlanMode      changeVlan, 
         pwVcEnetPortVlan      5, 
   
  pwVcType MAY equal ÊEthernet∆ or ÊEthernetTagged∆, ÊEthernetTagged∆ 
  is RECOMMENDED. 

  2c) The service delimiting tag is removed when the packet is sent to 
  the PW.

         pwVcEnetPwVlan        5, 
         pwVcEnetVlanMode      removeVlan, 
         pwVcEnetPortVlan      4097, 
   
  pwVcType MAY equal ÊEthernet∆ or ÊEthernetTagged∆, ÊEthernetTagged∆ 
  is RECOMMENDED. 
   
  One should note that this mode is also applicable when the service 
  delimiting tag is a service provider tag (VLAN=5 in this case), and 
  the service provider actually replace the map the traffic to a 
  single PW independent of the packet format on top of this VLAN.  

  
  2d) Untagged packets mapped to a PW as is (packets with a VLAN field 
  from tha same port MAY be mapped to other PWs). 
   
         pwVcEnetPwVlan        4096, 
         pwVcEnetVlanMode      noChange, 
         pwVcEnetPortVlan      4096, 
   
  pwVcType MAY equal ÊEthernet∆ or ÊEthernetTagged∆, ÊEthernetTagged∆ 
  is RECOMMENDED. 

  2e) Untagged packets mapped to a PW, and a VLAN field is added to 
  the packet.  
   
         pwVcEnetPwVlan        6, 
         pwVcEnetVlanMode      addVlan, 
         pwVcEnetPortVlan      4096, 
   
  pwVcType MAY equal ÊEthernet∆ or ÊEthernetTagged∆, ÊEthernetTagged∆ 
  is RECOMMENDED. 

  2f) A provider VLAN (value 10) is added to the packet coming with 
  VLAN value 5 before it is sent to the PW. 
   
         pwVcEnetPwVlan        10, 
         pwVcEnetVlanMode      addVlan, 
         pwVcEnetPortVlan      5, 
   
  pwVcType MAY equal ÊEthernet∆ or ÊEthernetTagged∆, ÊEthernetTagged∆ 
  is RECOMMENDED. 

  3) Nested VLAN (QinQ): When only the first VLAN is the service 
  delimiting tag, the modes as described in 2) SHOULD be used. In 
  other cases, i.e. the service delimiting tag is both the first VLAN 
  and the second VLAN, the following option is supported by this MIB 
  module. Other scenarios are considered out of the scope and should 
  be handled by other MIB modules that manage the forwarder.

  Assuming the provider tag equals 5 and the (inner) VLAN equal 100, 
  this traffic can be mapped to the PW without the provider tag by 
  using the following configuration: 
   
         pwVcEnetPwVlan        100, 
         pwVcEnetVlanMode      removeVLAN, 
         pwVcEnetPortVlan      5, 
   
  pwVcType MAY equal ÊEthernet∆ or ÊEthernetTagged∆, ÊEthernetTagged∆ 
  is RECOMMENDED. 
   
  Packets of the same provider tag MAY be mapped to other PWs.

          - 'other' indicate operation that is not defined by 
            this MIB module. 
   
          - 'portBased' indicates that the forwarder will forward 
            packets between the port and the PW independent of their 
            structure (i.e. there is no service delimiting VLAN tags 
            from the PE standpoint).  
   
          - 'noChange' indicates that the PW contains the original 
             user VLAN, as specified in pwVcEnetPortVlan, i.e. the 
             VLAN on the PE-CE link is the service delimiting tag 
             and is kept as is on the PW. This is allowed only for 
             pwVcType equal 'ethernetTagged'.

            may be different than the VLAN field on the user's  
            port. the VLAN on the PE-CE link is the service delimiting 
            tag but has a different value on the PW. 
   
          - 'removeVlan' indicates that the encapsulation on the  
            PW does not include the service delimiting VLAN field.  
            Note that PRI bits transparency is lost in this case. 
   
          - 'addVlan' indicate that a VLAN field will be added 
            on the PSN bound direction. pwVcEnetPwVlan indicates 
            the value that will be added.

8 Security Considerations 
   
  It is clear that this MIB module is potentially useful for 
  Monitoring of Ethernet PW capable PEs.  This MIB module can also be 
  used for configuration of certain objects, and anything that can be 
  configured can be incorrectly configured, with potentially 
  disastrous results. 
      
  There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module 
  with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such 
  objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
  environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
  environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
  network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their 
  sensitivity/vulnerability: 
   
     o    the pwVcEnetTable and the pwVcEnetMplsPriMappingTable 
          collectively contain objects to provision Ethernet PWs.  
          Unauthorized access to objects in these tables, could result  
          in disruption of traffic on the network.  The use of  
          stronger mechanisms such as SNMPv3 security should be  
          considered where possible.  Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and  
          USM MUST be used with any v3 agent which implements this MIB  
          module.   
          Administrators should consider whether read access to these  
          objects should be allowed, since read access may be  
          undesirable under certain circumstances. 
   
  Some of the readable objects in this MIB module "i.e., objects with 
  a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible" may be considered sensitive 
  or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to 
  control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly 
  to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over 
  the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their 
  sensitivity/vulnerability: 
   
     o    the pwVcEnetTable and the pwVcEnetMplsPriMappingTable 
          collectively show the Ethernet PW service configuration.  
          If an Administrator does not want to reveal this 
          information, then these tables should be 
          considered sensitive/vulnerable. 
   
  SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
  Even if the network itself is secure "for example by using IPSec", 
  even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is 
  allowed to access and GET/SET "read/change/create/delete" the 
  objects in this MIB module.

                    Management Information Base 


   
  It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features 
  as provided by the SNMPv3 framework "see [RFC3410], section 8", 
  including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms "for 
  authentication and privacy". 
   
  Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
  RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
  enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
  responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
  instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access 
  to the objects only to those principals "users" that have legitimate 
  rights to indeed GET or SET "change/create/delete" them. 
   
9 IANA considerations 
   
  As requested in the PW TC MIB [PWTCMIB], PWE3 related standards 
  track MIB modules should be rooted under the pwStdMIB subtree. The 
  IANA is requested to assign { pwStdMIB 5 } to the PW ENET MIB module 
  specified in this document.
