Internet-Draft         MIPv6 Experimental Messages         December 2006


1.  Introduction

   When experimenting with a protocol or defining a new extension to a
   protocol, one needs either a protocol number, a new message or an
   option to carry the information related to the experiment.  Most
   implementations end up using unassigned values for the new messages.
   Many times this creates problems when the same value is assigned
   through the IETF standards action, by IANA or if the implementation
   gets deployed with these messages.  Therefore it is considered a good
   practice to set aside some messages for experimental purposes.  The
   need for experimental messages is shown in [3].

   This document defines new messages for experimenting with extensions
   to the Mobile IPv6 protocol.  These messages should be strictly used
   for experiments.  Experiments that are successful should be
   standardized in the IETF.  An implementation MUST NOT be released or
   deployed with the experimental messages.

   This document defines a new Mobility Header message, the Experimental
   Mobility message that can be sent at any time by the mobile node, the
   home agent or the correspondent node.  Since Mobility Header messages
   cannot be combined and sent in one packet, there is always only one
   Mobility Header message in any Mobile IPv6 packet.  Home agent or
   correspondent node implementations that do not recognize the mobility
   message type, discard the message and send Binding Error message as
   described in [2], with the Status field set to 2 (unrecognized MH
   Type value).  Mobile nodes that do not recognize the mobility message
   type should discard the message and send an ICMP Parameter problem
   with code 0.

   This document also defines a new mobility option, the Experimental
   Mobility option, which can be carried in any Mobility Header message.
   Mobility options, by definition, can be skipped if an implementation
   does not recognize the mobility option type [2].

   The messages defined in this document can also be used for NEMO
   implementations [4].


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].

3.  Experimental Mobility Header message

   The following illustrates the message format for the Experimental
   Mobility Header message.  The 'MH Type' field in the Mobility Header
   indicates that it is an Experimental Mobility Header message.

   If no data is present in this message, padding is not necessary and
   since the first 8 octets are excluded while calculating the length of
   the message, the 'Header Len' field in the Mobility Header is set to
   0.

     .                                                               .

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Reserved

      A 16-bit reserved field set to zero by the sender and ignored by
      the receiver.

   Data

      Data specific to the experimental protocol extension.  The total
      length is indicated by the 'Header Len' field in the Mobility
      Header.


4.  Experimental Mobility Option

   The Experimental mobility option can be included in any Mobility
   Header message.  If the Mobility Header message includes a Binding
   Authorization Data option [2], then the Experimental Mobility Option
   should appear before the Binding Authorization Data option.

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Type

      A 8-bit field indicating that it is an experimental mobility
      option.

   Length

      A 8-bit indicating the length of the option in octets excluding
      the Type and Length fields.

   Data

      Data related to the experimental protocol extension.


5.  Security Considerations

   Protection for the Experimental Mobility Header message and mobility
   option depends on the experiment that is being carried out and the
   kind of information that is being carried in the messages.  If these
   messages carry information that should not be revealed on the wire or
   that can affect the binding cache entry at the home agent or the
   correspondent node, they should be protected in a manner similar to
   Binding Updates and Binding Acknowledgements.


6.  IANA Considerations

   The Experimental Mobility Header message defined in Section 3, should
   have the type value allocated from the same space as the 'MH Type'
   field in the Mobility Header [2].

   The Experimental mobility option defined in Section 4, should have
   the type value allocated from the same space as Mobility Options [2].
