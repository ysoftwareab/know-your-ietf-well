Abstract 
    
   This specification defines an extension to the Management Information 
   Base (MIB) for use with SNMP-based network management. In particular, 
   it defines objects for configuring, monitoring, and controlling 
   routers that employ the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol for IPv6 
   as defined in draft-ietf-vrrp-ipv6-spec-04.txt [19]. 
    
   This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant with 
   SMIv2 [5], and semantically identical to the SMIv1 definitions [2].

1. The SNMP Management Framework 
    
   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major 
   components: 
   - An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1]. 
   - Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the 
     purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of 
     Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 
     16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The 
     second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 
     [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7]. 
   - Message protocols for transferring management information. The 
     first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and 
     described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP   
     message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track 
     protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC     
     1906 [10].  The third version of the message protocol is called     
     SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574     
     [12]. 
   - Protocol operations for accessing management information. The 
     first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is 
     described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol 
     operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 
     [13]. 
   - A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and     
     the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 
     [15]. 
    
   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework   
   can be found in RFC 2570 [16]. 
    
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed   
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are   
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI. 
    
   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A   
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate   
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically   
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no   
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable   
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in   
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine 
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the   
   MIB.

2. Overview 
    
   VRRP protocols as defined in RFC 2338 [17] and draft-ietf-vrrp-ipv6-
   spec-04.txt [19] are inherently IP version specific. Though both the 
   protocols are similar they are not identical and can coexist on a 
   network element. Network managers should be able to configure and 
   monitor these protocols independently. RFC 2787 [21] defines managed 
   objects that are specific to VRRP protocol for IPv4 networks as 
   defined in RFC 2338 [17]. This document defines managed objects for 
   configuring and monitoring VRRP protocol for IPv6 networks as defined 
   in draft-ietf-vrrp-ipv6-spec-04.txt [19] 
    
     
   IPv6 hosts on a LAN will usually learn about one or more default   
   routers by receiving Router Advertisements sent using the IPv6   
   Neighbor Discovery protocol [ND].  The Router Advertisements are   
   multicast periodically at a rate that the hosts will learn about the   
   default routers in a few minutes. They are not sent frequently enough   
   to rely on the absence of the router advertisement to detect router   
   failures. 
    
   The Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol for IPv6 provides a much 
   faster switch over to an alternate default router than can be   
   obtained using standard ND procedures.  Using VRRP for IPv6 a backup 
   router can take over for a failed default router in around three 
   seconds (using VRRP for IPv6 default parameters). This is done with 
   out any interaction with the hosts and a minimum amount of VRRP 
   traffic. 
    
    
2.1 Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol for IPv6 
    
   This MIB is based on the following characteristics of VRRP as defined   
   in the VRRP for IPv6 specification [19]. 
      - A "VRRP IPv6 router" is one that is configured to run the VRRP 
        for IPv6 protocol in conjunction with one or more other VRRP 
        IPv6 routers attached to a LAN. 
      - A VRRP IPv6 router can be running one or more instances of a 
        virtual     router. 
      - A "IPv6 virtual router" is an abstraction, which consists of 
        two or more physical routers associated by a IPv6 Virtual 
        Router Identifier (IPv6VRID). 
      - An instance of a virtual router (on a physical VRRP IPv6 
        router), can be uniquely identified by a combination of the 
        'ifIndex' [18] and "Virtual Router Identifier" (IPv6VRID).

2.2 VRRP IPv6 MIB Structure 
    
   The VRRP IPv6 MIB contains three conformance groups: 
      - vrrpIpv6Operations Group: Objects related to VRRP IPv6 router's     
        configuration and control. 
      - vrrpIpv6Statistics Group: Objects containing information useful 
        in     monitoring the operation of VRRP IPv6 routers. 
    
      - vrrpIpv6Notifications Group: Consists of objects and 
        definitions for use in SNMP notifications sent by VRRP Ipv6 
        routers. 
    
   Tables in the MIB include the following: 
    
   (1)The vrrpIpv6OperTable, which contains objects that define the       
        operational characteristics of a VRRP IPv6 router. Rows in this 
        table correspond to instances of virtual routers. 
    
   (2)The vrrpIpv6RouterStatsTable which contains the operating 
        statistics for a VRRP IPv6 router. 
    
2.3 VRRP for IPv6 MIB Table Design 
    
   The tables in the VRRP for IPv6 MIB are structured with the 
   assumption that a VRRP network management application would likely be 
   designed to display information or provide configuration about a IPv6 
   VRRP router on a "per-IPv6-virtual-router basis". Thus, the tables 
   defined in the MIB consist of conceptual rows which are grouped in a 
   manner to present a view of individual virtual routers with a minimal 
   number of SNMP operations. 
    
2.4 Relation to Interface Group (RFC 2233) [18] 
    
   Since a router can be participating in VRRP over IPv6 on one or more 
   physical interfaces, "ifIndex" is used as an index into the tables 
   defined in the VRRP IPv6 MIB. 
    
2.5 VRRP IPv6 Scenario 
    
   The following section provides examples of how some of the objects in 
   this MIB are instantiated for two different VRRP IPv6 scenarios. 
    
    
   KEY: 
   ---- 
    
   The labels in the following tables and diagrams correspond to the 
   actual MIB objects as follows:

   if      = vrrpIpv6OperIfIndex 
   IPv6VrId= vrrpIpv6OperVrId 
   State   = vrrpIpv6OperState 
   Prior   = vrrpIpv6OperPriority 
   AddrType= vrrpIpv6OperIpAddrType 
   IpAddr  = vrrpIpv6OperMasterIpAddr 
   RowStat = vrrpIpv6OperRowStatus 
    
   The following figure shows a simple network with two VRRP IPv6 
   routers configured with two virtual routers. This sample topology is 
   taken from the VRRP specification [17]. Addresses in '()' indicate 
   the IPv6 address of the default gateway for a given host, H1 - H4. In 
   the diagram, "Interface" is used in the context defined in IF-MIB 
   [18].

   NOTES: 
    
   1) "I1" and "I2" are used to designate IF indices on each respective 
       router. 
   2) For "State": M = Master; B = Backup. 
   3) In the vrrpIpv6OperTable, a "priority" of 255 indicates that the     
       respective router owns the IPv6 address, e.g., this IPv6 address 
       is native to the router (i.e., "the IPv6 Address Owner" [17]).

4. Security considerations 
    
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that 
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write or read-create. Such objects 
   may be considered sensitive or vulnerable to security attacks in some 
   networking environments. The support for SET operations in a non-
   secure environment without proper protection can have a negative 
   effect on VRRP router operations. 
    
   A number of objects in the vrrpIpv6OperTable possess the read-create 
   attribute. Manipulation of these objects is capable of affecting the 
   operation of a virtual router. 
    
   Specific examples of this include, but are not limited to: 
    
   o The vrrpIpv6OperAdminState object which could be used to disable a 
   virtual router. 
    
   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the network 
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no 
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and 
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security 
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically,        
   the use of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the 
   View-based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended. 
    
   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP 
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly 
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals 
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET 
   (change/create/delete) them.

9. Changes from RFC 2787 
    
   - General rewrite to change MIB definition to accommodate protocol 
     changes in virtual router functionality from IPv4 to IPv6. 
   - Change all definitions of IPaddress to InetAddress and add 
     InetAddressType as defined in RFC 3291 [20] in the following : 
        o vrrpIPv6OperTable defined with vrrpIpv6OperIpAddrType and 
          vrrpIPv6OperMasterIpAddr.

INTERNET-DRAFT               VRRP IPv6 MIB                   June 2003 
 
 
   - There is no definition to support multiple IP addresses per 
     virtual router in VRRP-IPv6 and hence the following have been 
     changed  
        o No corresponding definition to vrrpAssoAddrTable. 
        o No definition corresponding to vrrpPrimaryIPAddress  
        o No definition corresponding to vrrpIPAddrCount 
   - Added vrrpIpv6StatsAsMasterUpTime to vrrpIPv6Statisctcs group. 
   - There is no authentication mechanism defined in VRRP for IPv6 
     protocol. So all authentication related configuration, statistics 
     and notifications are removed. 
   - Changed vrrpIpv6StatsIpTtlErrors to vrrpIpv6HopLimitErrors 
   - Added new trap to indicate various errors encountered by the VRRP 
     protocol. 
   - Added ErrorReason to indicate the reason for vrrpIpv6ErrorTrap. 
   - Updated mib description with copyright information. 
   - Modify conformance statement to reflect changes in 
     vrrpIpv6OperGroup and vrrpIPv6StatsGroup.
