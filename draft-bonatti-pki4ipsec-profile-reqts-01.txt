Abstract 
    
   This informational document describes and identifies the requirements 
   for a profile of a certificate management protocol to handle Public 
   Key Certificate (PKC) lifecycle interactions between Internet 
   Protocol Secuity (IPsec) Virtual Private Network (VPN) Systems using 
   IKE (versions 1 and 2) and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Systems. 
   These requirements are designed so that they meet the needs of 
   enterprise scale IPsec VPN deployments. It is intended that a 
   standards track profile will be created that fulfills these 
   requirements.

1 Introduction 
    
   This document enumerates requirements for PKC management interaction 
   among different IPsec VPN products and PKI products in order to 
   better enable large scale, PKI-supported IPsec VPN deployments. 
   Requirements for both the IPsec and the PKI products are discussed. 
   The goal is to create a set of requirements from which a profile 
   document will be derived. The specification will clarify the 
   transactions necessary between the VPN System and the PKI System that 
   enable the deployment of easily manageable, easily scalable VPNs. 
   When implemented, the specification will enable improved 
   interoperability between IPsec and PKI products. The requirements are 
   carefully designed to achieve security without compromising ease of 
   management and deployment, even where the deployment involves tens of 
   thousands of IPsec users and devices. 
    
   Within IPsec VPNs, the PKI supports authentication of IPSec Peers 
   through digital signatures during security association establishment 
   using IKE. The protocol and PKI operational usages are considered in 
   order to define a common, single set of methods (which forces 
   interoperability) between PKI Systems and VPN Systems for large-scale 
   deployments. The requirements address the entire lifecycle for PKI 
   usage within IPsec transactions: pre-authorization of PKC issuance, 
   enrollment process (PKC request and retrieval), PKC renewals and 
   changes, revocation, validation and repository lookups. They enable a 
   VPN Operator to: 
    
     - Authorize individual or batches of PKC issuances based on locally 
       defined criteria, and do so from the VPN Administration point. 
    
     - Provision PKI-based user or machine identity to IPsec Peers, on a 
       large scale. Provision means the IPsec Peer ends up with a valid 
       public and private key pair and PKC based on the IETF Public Key 
 
Bonatti, Turner, Lebowitz                                            3 
 
Internet-Draft            Requirements for an               July 2004 
                  IPsec Certificate Management Profile 
                                     
       Infrastructure X.509 (PKIX) PKC profile from [CERTPROFILE]. 
       These are used in the IKE negotiation for tunnel setup.  
    
     - Set the corresponding gateway or client authorization policy for 
       remote access and site-to-site connections. 
    
     - Establish automatic renewal for PKCs, or changes. 
    
     - Ensure timely revocation information is available for PKCs used 
       in IKE exchanges. 
    
   The desired outcome is that both IPSec and PKI vendors create 
   interoperable products to enable such scalable deployments, and do so 
   as quickly as possible. For example, an VPN Operator should be able 
   to use any conforming IPsec implementation of the certificate 
   management profile with any conforming PKI vendor's implementation to 
   perform the VPN rollout and management as described below. 
    
   The certificate management profile will also clarify and constrain 
   existing PKIX and IPsec standards and protocols for easier 
   understanding and the limiting of complexity in deployment. Some new 
   elements are identified that may require either a new protocol, or 
   changes or extensions to an existing protocol, especially in the area 
   of bulk authorization for PKC issuance. The document introduces the 
   idea of a VPN Administration function (Admin) within the VPN System. 
   This VPN Administration function bears great responsibility for the 
   task of managing pre-authorization for PKC issuance and of 
   distributing the results between the VPN System and the PKI System. 
    
    
1.1 Scope 
    
   The solution described in this document focuses on the requirements 
   for the interaction between the VPN Systems and the PKI Systems.  The 
   internals of the operation of these systems are beyond scope. 
    
   The solution focuses on the needs of large-scale rollouts, i.e. VPNs 
   including hundereds or thousands of managed VPN gateways or VPN 
   remote access clients. The needs of small deployments are a stated 
   non-goal, however service providers employing the scoped solution and 
   applying it to many smaller deployments in aggregate may address 
   them. 
    
   Gateway-to-gateway access and end-user remote access (to a gateway) 
   are both covered. End-to-end communications are not necessarily 
   excluded but are intentionally not a focus. 
    
   There is no intention to discuss all or other PKI issues here. The 
   scope is limited to requirements for easing and enabling scalable 
   IPsec with PKI deployments.

Internet-Draft            Requirements for an               July 2004 
                  IPsec Certificate Management Profile 
                                     
   The requirements strive to meet eighty percent of the market needs 
   for large-scale deployments. Environments will understandably exist 
   in which large-scale deployment tools are desired, but local security 
   policy stringency will not allow for the use of such commercial 
   tools. The solution will possibly miss the needs of the highest ten 
   percent of stringency and lowest ten percent of convenience 
   requirements. Use cases will be considered or rejected based upon 
   this eighty percent rule. 
    
    
1.2 Non-Goals 
    
   The scenario for PKC cross-certification will not be addressed. 
    
   The specification for the communication method and transactions 
   between VPN Administration function and IPSec Peers is up to vendor 
   implementation and therefore is not expected to be included in the 
   certificate management profile. Such a protocol may be standardized 
   at a later date to enable interoperability between VPN Administration 
   function stations and IPsec Peers from different vendors, but is far 
   beyond the scope of this current effort, and will be considered 
   opaque by the certificate management profile. 
    
    
1.3 Definitions 
    
   VPN System 
   The VPN System is comprised of the VPN Admininistration function 
   (defined below), the  IPsec Peers, and the communication mechanism 
   between the VPN Administration and the  IPsec Peers. VPN System is 
   defined in more detail in section 2.1. 
    
   PKI System 
   The PKI System, or simply PKI, is the set of functions needed to 
   authorize and issue PKCs and provide revocation information about 
   those PKCs. PKI System is defined in more detail in section 2.2. 
    
   (VPN) Operator 
   The Operator is the person or group of people that define security 
   policy and configure the VPN System to enforce that policy. 
    
   IPsec Peer (Gateway or Client) 
   For the purposes of this document, an IPsec Peer, or simply "Peer", 
   is any IPsec System that communicates IKE and IPsec to another Peer 
   in order to create a secure tunnel for communications. It can be 
   either a traditional security gateway (with two network interfaces, 
   one for the protected network and one for the unprotected network), 
   or it can be an IPsec client (with a single network interface). In 
   both cases, the IPsec System can pass traffic with no IPsec 
   protection, and can add IPsec protection to chosen traffic streams. 
    
   (VPN) Admin

Internet-Draft            Requirements for an               July 2004 
                  IPsec Certificate Management Profile 
                                     
   The function of the VPN System that manages and distributes policy to 
   Peers and who interacts with the PKI System to define policy for PKC 
   provisioning for the VPN connections. See Section 2.1.1 below for 
   more details.  
    
   End Entity 
   An end entity is the entity or subject that a PKC exists to 
   authenticate. The end entity is the one entity that will finally use 
   a private key associated with a PKC to sign data. In this document, 
   the end entity is also an IPsec Peer. 
    
   Community Realm 
   A community realm is the set of IPsec Peers and VPN Administration 
   function that operate under a common policy, and PKI authorizations. 
    
   PKC Renewal 
   The acquisition of a new PKC (often accompanied by a new key) due to 
   the expiration of an existing PKC. Renewal occurs prior to the 
   expiration of the existing PKC to avoid any connection outages. 
    
   PKC Change 
   A special case of a renewal; like occurrence where a PKC needs to be 
   changed prior to expiration due to some change in its subject's 
   information. Examples might include change in the address or 
   identifying information of the end entity. 
    
   Registration Authority (RA) 
   An optional entity in a PKI System given responsibility for 
   performing some of the administrative tasks necessary in the 
   registration of end entities, such as confirming the subject's 
   identity and verifying that the subject has possession of the private 
   key associated with the public key requested for a PKC. 
    
   Certificate Authority (CA) 
   An authority in a PKI System trusted by one or more users to create 
   and assign PKCs. It is important to note that the CA is responsible 
   for the PKCs during their whole lifetime, not just for issuing them. 
    
   Repository  
   An Internet-accessible server in a PKI System that stores and makes 
   available for retrieval PKCs and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs). 
    
   Root CA/Trust Anchor 
   A CA that is directly trusted by an end entity; that is, securely 
   acquiring the value of a Root CA public key requires some out-of-band 
   step(s). This term is not meant to imply that a Root CA is 
   necessarily at the top of any hierarchy, simply that the CA in 
   question is trusted directly. 
    
   Certificate Revocation List (CRL) 
   A CRL is a time stamped list identifying revoked PKCs that is signed 
   by a CA and made freely available in a public repository. Peers

                  IPsec Certificate Management Profile 
                                     
   retrieve the CRL to verify that a PKC being presented to them as 
   identity in an IKE transaction has not been revoked. 
    
   CRL Distribution Point (CDP) 
   The CDP extension in a PKC identifies the location from which end 
   entities should retrieve CRLs to perform local validity checking. 
    
   Authority Info Access (AIA) 
   The AIA extension in a PKC indicates how to access CA information and 
   services for the issuer of the PKC in which the extension appears. 
   Information and services may include on-line validation services and 
   Certificate Policy (CP) data. 
    
    
1.4 Requirements Terminology 
    
   Though this document is not an Internet Draft, we use the convention 
   that the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in [MUSTSHOULD]. 
    
    
2. Architecture 
    
   This section describes the overall architecture for a PKI-supported 
   IPsec VPN deployment. First an explanation of the VPN System is 
   presented. Second, key points about the PKI System are stated. Third, 
   the architecture picture is presented. Last, the process of the 
   interaction between the two Systems for large-scale deployment is 
   described. 
    
    
    
2.1 VPN System 
    
   The VPN System consists of the IPsec Peers and the VPN Administration 
   function, as depicted in Figure 1.

2.1.1 IPsec Peer(s) 
    
   The Peers are two entities between which the Operator requires an 
   IPsec tunnel establishment. Two Peers are shown in Figure 1, but 
   implementations MAY support an actual number in the hundreds or 
   thousands. The Peers could be either gateway-to-gateway, remote-
   access-host-to-gateway, or a mix of both. The Peers authenticate 
   themselves in the IKE negotiation using digital signatures through a 
   PKI System. 
    
2.1.2 VPN Administration Function (Admin) 
    
   This document defines the notion of a VPN Administration function, 
   hereafter referred to as Admin, and gives the Admin great 
   responsibility within the solution. The Admin is a centralized 
   function. It defines the VPN System policy and informs the PKI and 
   Peers how it wants each to enforce that policy. One main role defined 
   here is that Admin specifies to the PKI the contents and use 
   parameters of the credentials the PKI will issue, or at least 
   references a template or policy-set for a Peer or set of Peers. In 
   this way Admin MAY perform many RA-like functions, for example 
   authorization of PKC issuance and revocation. 
    
   It is important to note that, within this document, Admin is neither 
   a device nor a person, rather it is a function. Every large-scale VPN 
   deployment will contain the Admin function. The function may be 
   performed on a stand-alone work station, on a gateway, on an 
   administration software component, etc. It is also possible for the 
   Admin function to be one in the same as the gateway or client device 
   or software. They are represented in the architectural diagram below 
   as different functions, but they need not be different physical 
   entities. As such, Admin's architecture and the means by which it 
   interacts with the participating IPsec Peers will vary widely from

   implementation to implementation. However some basic functions of the 
   Admin are assumed. 
    
     - It will be the place where Certificate Policy (CP) (see RFC 3647) 
       for use in the VPN is defined, not the PKI. In VPN Systems the 
       Operator chooses to strengthen the VPN by using PKI; PKI is a 
       bolt-on to the VPN System. The PKC characteristics and contents 
       are a function of the local security policy the VPN serves to 
       enforce. Therefore the Operator will configure policy and 
       contents for PKCs in the Admin, and apply those templates to 
       groups of IPsec Peers. 
    
     - It will interact directly with the PKI System to initiate 
       authorization for end entity PKCs by sending the parameters and 
       contents for those PKCs, or by referring to a template or 
       policy-set on the PKI. (Such templates would likely have been 
       created in conjunction with the Operator.) It will receive back 
       from the PKI identification values and authorization codes to be 
       used in the PKC requests for each of the pre-authorized PKCs. 
    
     - It will deliver instructions to the IPsec Peers, and the Peers 
       will carry out those instructions. An example of such an 
       instruction is an IKE policy configuration. Therefore, the 
       communication mechanism between the Admin and the IPsec Peers 
       MUST be private, authenticated and employ integrity checks. The 
       contents of some such instructions will be defined below. 
       However, the communication mechanism will be handled completely 
       within the VPN System and is out of the scope of this document 
       (see Scope, Section 1.1 above). 
    
   The Admin MUST be reachable by the Peers. Most implementations will 
   meet this requirement by ensuring the Peer can connect to the Admin 
   from anywhere on the network or Internet. However, communication 
   between the Admin and Peer may not necessarily be "on-line". It may, 
   in some environments, be "moving media," i.e. the configuration or 
   data may be loaded on to a floppy disk or other media and physically 
   moved to the IPsec Peer. This reality should be considered when 
   requirements are defined, and when supporting networks are 
   architected. 
    
    
2.2 PKI System 
    
   The PKI System, as depicted in Figure 2, may be set up and operated 
   by the Operator (in-house), may be provided by third party PKI 
   providers to which connectivity is available at the time of 
   provisioning (managed PKI service), or may be integrated with the VPN 
   product.

                              Figure 2: PKI System 
    
   This framework assumes that all components of the VPN will obtain 
   PKCs from a single PKI community. An IPsec Peer MAY accept a PKC from 
   a Peer that is from a CA outside of the PKI community, but the auto 
   provision and life cycle management for such a PKC or its trust 
   anchor PKC fall out of scope.  
    
   The PKI System will contain a mechanism for handling Admin's 
   authorization requests and PKC enrollments. These mechanisms are 
   referred to as the RA. The PKI System contains a Repository used by 
   the Peers to look up each other's PKCs. Last, the PKI System contains 
   the core function of a CA that uses a public and private key pair and 
   signs PKCs. 
    
   The PKI System SHOULD be built so that lookups resolve directly and 
   completely at the URL indicated in a CDP, or AIA. The PKI ought to be 
   built such that URL contents do not contain referrals to other hosts 
   or URLs, as such referral lookups will increase the time to complete 
   the IKE negotiation, and can cause implementations to timeout. 
    
    
2.3 VPN-PKI Interaction 
    
   The interaction between the VPN System and the PKI System is the key 
   focus of this requirements document, as shown in Figure 3. It is 
   therefore sensible to consider the steps necessary to set up, use and 
   manage PKCs for one Peer to establish an association with another 
   Peer. Figure 4 (below) illustrates the information flow associated 
   with the steps initial PKC generation relative to the architecture 
   diagram. Figure 5 (below) illustrates the information flow associated 
   with the steps PKC renewal relative to the architecture diagram. 
   Figure 6 (below) illustrates the information flow associated with the 
   steps PKC renewal relative to the architecture diagram. For 
   simplicity only the steps associated with IPsec Peer 1 are shown.

                  Figure 4.  VPN-PKI Interaction Steps: 
                IPsec Peer Generates Keys and PKC Request, 
                         Enrolls Directly with PKI 
    
    
   1) Authorization [A]. Admin sends a list of IDs and PKC contents for 
   the PKI System to authorize enrollment. The PKI returns a list of 
   unique identifiers and one-time tokens to be used for the enrollment 
   of each PKC. Other PKC usage policy is also set at this time, for 
   example parameters for renewals or changes, key lengths, etc. The 
   amount of information that the Admin communicates to the PKI about 
   how it wants the PKCs built could be very small, perhaps just a 
   reference to a template already existing in the PKI System. Likewise 
   it could be very large, with several fields being specified along 
   with their contents. [EDITOR'S NOTE: We need some work on this line 
   of thought.] 
    
   2) Authorization Response [A]. The PKI System acknowledges the 
   authorizations provided in (1). Response may indicate success or 
   failure for any particular authorization. 
    
   3) Generate Keys and PKC Request [G]. The Admin communicates with the 
   Peer to either give it information so that it can generate a public 
   and private key pair and PKC request and send the request directly to 
   the PKI. 
    
   4) Enrollment [E]. The IPsec Peer requests a PKC from the PKI, 
   providing the generated public key.  The IPsec Peer generates the key 
   pair and PKC request. 
    
   5) Enrollment Response [E]. The PKI responds to the enrollment 
   request sent in (4), providing either the new PKC that was generated 
   or a suitable error indication.

   6) Enrollment Confirmation. Peer must positively acknowledge receipt 
   of new PKC. 
    
   7) PKC Posting. The newly-generated PKC for IPsec Peer 1 is posted to 
   the repository. 
    
   8) Maintenance [M]. The IPsec Peer accesses the PKI to support look-
   up of PKCs for other IPsec Peers, certification path validation, and 
   revocation checking. This step consists of sending requests for 
   specific PKCs or CRLs, or requests for the PKI System to perform 
   validation checks. 
    
   9) Maintenance Response [M]. The PKI responds to the maintenance 
   request sent in (7), providing either the requested PKC or CRL, 
   indicating the validity status of a PKC, or indicating an error 
   condition. 
    
   10) IKE/IPsec Communication [I]. The Peers communicate authenticated 
   by the PKCs they received from the PKI. 
    
    
2.3.2 Renewal PKC 
 
   The steps of the VPN-PKI interaction are summarized here for rewal 
   PKCs. The letters refer to Figure 3. The numbers refer to Figure 5. 
   The detailed requirements are described below in Section 3. Note that 
   there are a number of architectul options available and that the most 
   common architecture is depecited in Figure 4; IPsec Peer generated 
   Keys and IPsec Peer generated PKC Request. Other architectural 
   options are discussed in Section 3.

   1) Rekey or Renewal Initiation. The Admin communicates renewal or 
   change instructions to the Peers. Renewal may also be signalled to 
   the PKI (not shown), particularly if authorization changes are 
   necessary. Initiation of this process by the Admin enables IPsec 
   Peers to automatically generate renewal or change requests as needed 
   with minimal user burden, and for those requests to be immediately 
   granted by the PKI System. 
    
   2) Renewals and Changes [R]. The IPsec Peer requests renewal or 
   change of an existing PKC. Rekey MAY also occur depending upon policy 
   constraints. The renewal or change request will either be provided in 
   (10) above, or will be generated by the IPsec Peer. 
    
   3) Renewal/Change Response [R]. The PKI responds to the renewal or 
   change request sent in (11), providing either the new PKC that was 
   generated or a suitable error indication. 
    
   4) Enrollment Confirmation. Peer must positively acknowledge receipt 
   of new PKC. 
    
   5) PKC Posting. The newly-generated PKC for IPsec Peer 1 is posted to

   request sent in (7), providing either the requested PKC or CRL, 
   indicating the validity status of a PKC, or indicating an error 
   condition.

   the validity status of a PKC, or indicating an error condition. 
    
    
3 Requirements 
    
3.1 General Requirements 
    
3.1.1 One Protocol 
    
   This target profile will call for ONE PROTOCOL or ONE USE PROFILE for 
   each main element of the requirements. It is a specific goal to avoid 
   multiple protocols or profiles to solve the same requirement whenever 
   possible so as to reduce complexity and improve interoperability.

                  IPsec Certificate Management Profile 
                                     
   Meeting some of the requirements may necessitate the creation of a 
   new protocol or new extension for an existing protocol. 
    
   Conforming implementations MUST implement the ONE PROTOCOL or ONE USE 
   PROFILE that is specified for a given requirement. 
    
    
3.1.2 Secure Transactions 
    
   The target profile will specify the transactions for certificate 
   management between VPN and PKI Systems and their components, as 
   needed to ease large scale VPN deployment and management. 
   Specifically, Admin and PKI will transmit between themselves policy 
   details, identities, and keys. As such, the method of communication 
   for these transactions MUST be secured in a manner that ensures 
   privacy, authentication, message data integrity and non-repudiation. 
   This method will require that mutual trust be established between the 
   PKI and the Admin. 
    
   [EDITOR'S NOTE: Need to perhaps elaborate on "policy details" above.] 
    
    
3.1.3 PKI Availability 
    
   Central availability is required initially for authorization 
   transactions between the PKI and Admin. Further availability will be 
   required in most cases, but is a decision point for the Operator. 
   Most requirements and scenarios below assume on-line availability of 
   the PKI and Admin for the life of the VPN. 
    
   Off-line interaction between the VPN and PKI Systems (i.e., where 
   physical media is used as the transport method) is beyond the scope 
   of this document. 
    
    
3.1.4 End-User Transparency 
    
   PKI interactions are to be transparent to the user. Users need not 
   even be aware that PKI is in use. First time connections need consist 
   of no more than a prompt for some identification and pass phrase, and 
   a status bar notifying the user that setup is in progress.  
    
    
3.1.5 Error Handling 
    
   The PKC transaction protocol for the PKI and VPN System transactions 
   MUST specify error handling for each transaction. Thorough error 
   condition descriptions and handling instructions will greatly aid 
   interoperability efforts between the PKI and IPsec products.

3.2 Authorization Transactions 
    
3.2.1 Bulk Authorization 
    
   Bulk authoriztion occurs when the Admin requests of the PKI that 
   authorization be established for several different subjects with 
   almost the same contents. A minimum of one field (more is also 
   acceptable) MUST differ per subject. Because the authorization may 
   occur before any keys have been generated, the only way to determine 
   one authorization from another for the purpose of issuing unique 
   identifiers is by having at least one field differ. 
    
   The authorization MAY occur prior to the event of a PKC enrollment 
   request (in which case it is a "pre-authorization"), or within the 
   same connection. 
    
    
3.2.2 Protocol Preferences for Authorization 
    
   A single connection per multiple transactions. It is preferred that 
   the setup for all subjects in an authorization batch occurs in one 
   single connection to the RA/CA, with the number of subjects being one 
   or greater. Implementations should be able to handle tens of 
   thousands at a time. 
    
   ONE protocol must be specified for these Admin to RA/CA interaction. 
    
   The PKI responds to the Admin station with Authorization identifiers 
   (maybe serial numbers or such) and a corresponding pre-authorization 
   key (not to be confused with the public and private key pair) for 
   each identifier. 
    
   It is preferred that the transport used to carry the pre-
   authorization be reliable (TCP). 
    
   The protocol should be as lightweight as possible. 
    
   A method for securing the communication between the Admin and the PKI 
   MUST be defined, including privacy, authorization, and integrity. 
   PKCs and authorization of the Admin may need to be initialized by 
   physical rather than on-line means. 
    
    
3.2.3 Admin Authorization Requests to PKI 
    
3.2.3.1 Specifying Fields within the PKC 
    
   The VPN may send the PKI System the set of PKC contents that make up 
   a PKC template that it wants the PKI to use. In other words, it tells 
   the PKI System, "if you see a PKC request that looks like this, from 
   this person, process it and issue the PKC." Likewise, such a template

   may have already been defined on the PKI System, and the Admin may 
   simply reference it. 
    
   In the former case, the elements that the Admin MAY send to the PKI 
   to authorize the eventual creation of PKCs include: 
    
     - DN fields 
    
     - Any number of locally defined CNs with their contents [EDITOR'S 
       NOTE: this is difficult to do. We may need to say just one CN.] 
    
     - Validation Period of the PKC 
    
     - Renewal parameters (i.e., N% of validity period, and PKC overlap 
       duration in N [EDITOR'S NOTE: Should consider other factors. 
       Measurement? Minutes? Hours? Percentage?], or just let it 
       expire) 
    
     - Any of SubjAltName fields 
    
     - Key type 
    
     - Key length 
    
     - Any of the extension fields (Key usage, extended key usage, 
       Policy constraints, etc.) 
    
     - Require a CDP be filled in by the PKI in issuance. The 
       specification should define who will handle the CDP contents. 
       Suggest the PKI, not Admin, but further research is needed. 
    
    
3.2.3.2 Authorizations for Renewal and Change 
    
   When the Admin sends its authorization request information it MUST 
   also send information to the PKI about the local policy regarding 
   renewal and changes. These are: 
    
     - Admin MUST specify if automatic renewals are allowed, that is, 
       the Admin is presently authorizing the PKI to process a future 
       renewal for the specified end entity PKC. 
    
     - Admin MUST specify if any changes are allowed, that is, the Admin 
       is presently authorizing the PKI to accept a future request for 
       a new PKC creation with some element of the Subject or 
       SubjectAltName changed. 
    
   If a renewal is authorized, the Admin MUST further specify: 
    
     - Whether or not a new key must be used for the new PKC.

     - Who can renew, i.e. can only the admin send a renewal request or 
       can the end entity Peer send a request directly to the PKI, or 
       either. 
    
     - Specify at how long before the PKC expiration date the PKI will 
       accept and process a renewal. 
    
     - Length of time (if ever) after PKI receives end entity Peer 
       confirmation (see 3.4.8 and 3.6.1 below) that the old PKC is 
       revoked, and removed from repository. 
    
   If change request is authorized, the Admin MUST further specify: 
    
     - The fields in the Subject and SubjectAltName that are changeable 
    
     - The entity that can send the change request, i.e. only the Admin, 
       only the end entity, or either.  
    
     - Length of time (if ever) after PKI receives end entity Peer 
       confirmation (see 3.6.1 below) that the old PKC is revoked, and 
       removed from repository.  
    
    
3.2.3.3 Other Authorization Elements 
    
   CDP MUST be flagged as required in the authorization request. The 
   method MUST also be specified; HTTP is the MUST method, LDAP is MAY. 
    
   There will be an option to specify a Validation Period for the 
   authorization ID and its one-time-key. If such a Validation Period is 
   set, any requests using this authorization id and key that arrive 
   outside of the validation period MUST be dropped and the event 
   logged. 
    
   Ability to communicate the Community Realm for the PKC to the PKI. 
   Community Realm is an important component in provisioning that allows 
   the Admin to specify for the Peer various elements of the PKC's 
   contents that the PKI will fill in, and are not defined by the Admin. 
   It may be used to specify various local policy definitions. It also 
   will be used to label different groups to have different CRLs (for 
   example small CRLs with only gateways in the listing for use by 
   Remote Access Peers, or large CRLs with all Remote Access Peers and 
   gateways to be used by the Gateways). There will be a need for an 
   import and export for easily synchronizing the Community Realm lists 
   between the Admin and PKI System. 
    
   The Protocol should consider what happens when Admin requested 
   information conflicts with PKI settings such that the Admin request 
   cannot be issued as requested. (Ex: Admin requests Validation Period 
   = 3 weeks and CA is configured to only allow Validation Periods = 1 
   week.) Proper conflict handling MUST be specified.

3.2.4 Cancel Capability 
    
   Admin can send a cancel authorization message to PKI. [EDITOR'S NOTE: 
   Should the Peer be able to send a cancel message as well?] Admin MUST 
   provide the authorization ID and code in order to cancel the 
   Authorization. At that point, the authorization will be erased from 
   the PKI, and a log entry of the event written. After the cancellation 
   has been verified with the Admin (a Cancel, Cancel ACK, ACK type of a 
   process is required to cover a lost connections scenario), the PKI 
   will accept another Authorization request with the exact same 
   contents as the canceled one. The PKI MUST NOT accept a second 
   authorization request for the same identity [EDITOR'S NOTE: How do we 
   decide what defines "identity"?] if one already exists. 
    
    
3.2.5 PKI response to Admin 
    
   If the authorization is acceptable, the PKI will respond to the Admin 
   with a unique identifier per subject authorization required and a 
   one-time-authorization key per authorization ID. Strongly recommend 
   the one-time-authorization key be unique per authorization ID. The 
   more randomness that can be achieved in the relationship between an 
   identifier and its key the better. The key MUST be in ASCII format to 
   avoid incompatibilities that may occur due to international 
   characters. 
    
   All the contents of the PKC that it intends to issue will be returned 
   to the Admin. This will allow the Admin to perform an "operational 
   test" to verify that the issued PKCs will meet its requirements. 
    
   For any request, the PKI cannot change any of the specified values in 
   request within its response. We need to prevent a change in PKC 
   contents that may occur due to a change in PKI configuration right in 
   the middle of a batch pre-authorization request. 
    
   [EDITOR'S NOTE: what if the Admin sends a parameter that the PKI 
   cannot fulfil, i.e. the parameter contradicts PKI policy? Would need 
   to return an error code and description and refuse to authorize the 
   enrollment.] 
    
   After receiving a bulk authorization request from the Admin, the PKI 
   must be able to reply YES to those individual PKC authorizations that 
   it can satisfy and NO or FAILED for those requests that cannot be 
   satisfied, along with sufficient reason or error codes. 
    
   A method is needed to identify if there is a change in PKI setting 
   between the time the authorization is granted and PKC request occurs, 
   and what to do about the discrepancy.

3.2.6 Error Handling for Authorization Transactions 
    
   Thorough error condition descriptions and handling instructions are 
   required for each transaction in the authorization process. Providing 
   such error codes will greatly aid interoperability efforts between 
   the PKI and IPsec products. 
    
    
3.3 Key Generation and PKC Request Construction 
    
   Once the PKI System has responded with authorization identifiers and 
   keys, and this information is received at the Admin, the next step is 
   to generate public and private key pairs and to construct PKC 
   requests using those key pairs. The key generations MAY occur at one 
   of two places, depending on local requirements: at the IPsec Peer or 
   at the Admin. The PKC constructions MAY occur at either the IPsec 
   Peer or a combination of the Peer and the Admin. 
    
   [EDITOR's NOTE: Should we have different arrow diagrams for each 
   option? Option 1 is already depicted in Figure 4.  Should we show 
   the differences amongst the other three?] 
    
    
3.3.1 IPsec Peer Generates Key Pair and Constructs Request 
    
   This case will be used most often in the field. This is the most 
   secure method for keying; the keys are generated on the end entity 
   and never leave the end entity. 
    
   The Admin will send the authorization identifier and authorization 
   key to the end entity, the IPsec Peer. The Admin will also send any 
   other parameters needed by the Peer to generate the PKC request, 
   including key type and size. Recall that the mechanism for how this 
   information is communicated from the Admin to the Peer is opaque. 
    
   Receiving the command and the necessary information from the Admin, 
   the Peer will proceed to generate the key pair and construct the PKC 
   request. 
    
    
3.3.2 IPsec Peer Generates Key Pair, Admin Constructs Request 
    
   In this case, the Admin sends a command to the Peer to generate the 
   key pair. The Admin then constructs the PKC request on behalf of the 
   Peer, except for the signing. It sends the construction to the Peer 
   for signing, and the Peer returns the signed request construction 
   back to the Admin. The Admin then proceeds to enroll on behalf of the 
   client. 
    
   The advantage of this solution is that the private key never leaves 
   the IPsec Peer, but limits the amount the Peer must know and do 
   regarding PKC generation.

3.3.3 Admin Generates Key Pair and Constructs Request 
    
   The use case exists for deployments where end entities cannot 
   generate their own key pairs. Some examples are for PDAs and handsets 
   where to generate an RSA key would be operationally impossible due to 
   processing and battery constraints. Another case covers key recovery 
   requirements, where the same PKCs are used for other functions in 
   addition to IPsec, and key recovery is required (e.g. local data 
   encryption), therefore key escrow is needed off the end entity 
   station. If key escrow is performed then the exact requirements and 
   procedures for it are beyond the scope of this document. 
    
   The Admin will generate the key pair, construct the PKC request, and 
   enroll on behalf of the Peer. Once the PKC has been retrieved, the 
   keys and PKC will be sent to the Peer using a secure method.  The 
   nature of this secure method is beyond the scope of this document. 
    
   Performing a separate pre-authorization step is still of value even 
   though the Admin is the also performing the key generation. The 
   Community Realm, Subject fields, SubjectAlt fields and more are part 
   of the request, and must be communicated in some way from the Admin 
   to the PKI. Instead of creating a new mechanism, we simply use the 
   pre-authorize schema again. This also allows for the feature of role-
   based administration, where Operator1 is the only one allowed to have 
   the Admin function pre-authorize PKCs, but Operator2 is the one doing 
   batch enrollments and VPN device configurations. 
    
    
3.3.4 PKI Generates Key Pair and Passes to Peer via Admin 
    
   TBD - [EDITOR'S NOTE: There is another use case here: PKI generates 
   the key pair AND the PKC and simply hands it down to the Admin for 
   installation into the Peer. This is, in all likelihood, the easiest 
   way to deploy Certs, though sacrafices a bit in security. Do we just 
   specify PKCS12 and try to create some requirements for how the Admin 
   will say, "I need a cert for NNNNN," and how PKI will respond with 
   the PKCS12?] 
    
    
3.3.5 Trust Anchor PKC Acquisition 
    
   The root PKC MUST arrive on the Peer via one of two methods: 
    
   (a) Peer can get the root PKC via its secure communication with 
   Admin. This requires the Peer to know less about interaction with the 
   PKI. 
    
   (b) Admin can command Peer to retrieve the root cert directly from 
   the PKI. How retrieval of the root cert takes place is beyond scope,

   but is assumed to occur via an unauthenticated but confidential 
   enrollment protocol. 
    
    
3.3.6 Error Handling for Key Generation and Request Construction 
    
   Thorough error condition descriptions and handling instructions are 
   required for each transaction in the authorization process. Providing 
   such error codes will greatly aid interoperability efforts between 
   the PKI and IPsec products.  
    
    
3.4 Enrollment (Sending Request and PKC Retrieval) 
    
   Regardless of where the keys were generated and the PKC request 
   constructed, an enrollment process will need to occur to request a 
   PKC creation from the PKI and to retrieve that PKC. 
    
   The protocol MUST be exactly the same regardless of whether the 
   enrollment occurs from the Peer to the PKI or from the Admin to the 
   PKI (as seen below in sections 3.4.5 through 3.4.7). 
    
3.4.1 One protocol 
    
   One protocol MUST be specified for both request and retrieval. 
    
    
3.4.2 On-line protocol 
    
   The protocol MUST supports automated enrollment that occurs over the 
   Internet and without the need for manual intervention. 
    
3.4.3 Single Connection with Immediate Response 
    
   Request and retrieval MUST be able to occur in one on-line connection 
   between the end entity and the PKI (RA/CA). 
    
   The end entity sends the request, attaching the Authorization 
   identifier and key. 
    
   The RA/CA receives the request and uses the Authorization identifier 
   and key to match it to the proper pre-authorization entry. 
    
   Since the contents of the PKC match, and the Authorization identifier 
   and key are correct, the PKC is generated immediately, with no need 
   for manual intervention or review on the PKI System before issuance. 
    
   The PKI makes the PKC available immediately for retrieval, or 
   possibly sends the PKC to the end entity as a response in the request 
   or retrieval exchange.

3.4.4 Manual Approval Option 
    
   The optional capability to queue and manually approve PKC requests 
   MUST exist within the protocol for those organizations that will not 
   permit automation of credential issuing as described above. Likewise, 
   polling to determine if request has been satisfied and to try to 
   retrieve the PKC MUST exist within the protocol for those 
   organizations that will not permit automation of credential issuing 
   as described above. 
    
   End-entities and the PKI must disclose and agree upon which mode they 
   will support (automated approval or manual approval) within the 
   protocol. 
    
    
3.4.5 Enrollment Method 1: Peer Enrolls to PKI Directly 
    
   The enrollment MAY occur in one of three fashions, and valid use 
   cases exist for all three. First, and most straight forward, the 
   Admin can instruct the IPsec Peer to execute an enrollment, telling 
   it where to enroll, and providing any necessary parameters.  
    
   In this case the IPsec Peer only talks to the PKI after being 
   commanded to do so by the Admin.  Note that this enrollment mode is 
   depicted in Figure 4. 
    
    
3.4.6 Enrollment Method 2: IPsec Peer Enrolls to PKI through Admin 
    
   In this case, the IPsec Peer has generated the key pair and the PKC 
   request, but does not enroll directly to the PKI System. Instead, it 
   automatically sends its request to the Admin, and the Admin 
   automatically performs the enrollment to the PKI System. The PKI 
   System does not care where the enrollment comes from, as long as it 
   is a valid enrollment. Once the Admin retrieves the PKC, it then 
   automatically forwards it to the IPsec Peer, and the Peer can begin 
   using it in security policy. 
    
   The communication of the request, retrieval, renewal, or change, can 
   go directly from the end entity to the PKI, or be passed from end 
   entity through the Admin to the PKI. In the latter case, the end 
   entity need not know how to do all the direct communication with the 
   PKI; the function becomes focused in the Admin station. In either 
   case, the format of messages should be identical regardless of who is 
   sending the request. 
    
   Most IPsec Systems have enough CPU power to generate a public and 
   private key pair of sufficient strength for secure IPsec. In this 
   case, the end entity needs to prove to the Admin that they have such 
   a key pair; this is normally done by the Admin sending the end entity 
   a nonce, which the end entity signs and returns to the Admin along 
   with the end entity's public key.

                IPsec Peer Generates Keys and PKC Request, 
                         Enrolls Through Admin 
    
   1) Authorization [A]. Admin sends a list of IDs and PKC contents for 
   the PKI System to authorize enrollment. The PKI returns a list of 
   unique identifiers and one-time tokens to be used for the enrollment 
   of each PKC. Other PKC usage policy is also set at this time, for 
   example parameters for renewals or changes, key lengths, etc. The 
   amount of information that the Admin communicates to the PKI about 
   how it wants the PKCs built could be very small, perhaps just a 
   reference to a template already existing in the PKI System. Likewise 
   it could be very large, with several fields being specified along 
   with their contents. [EDITOR'S NOTE: We need some work on this line 
   of thought.] 
    
   2) Authorization Response [A]. The PKI System acknowledges the 
   authorizations provided in (1). Response may indicate success or 
   failure for any particular authorization. 
    
   3) Generate Keys and PKC Request [G]. The Admin communicates with the 
   Peer to give it information so that it can generate a public and 
   private key pair and PKC request and send the request back to the 
   Admin. 
    
   4) Enrollment [E]. The IPsec Peer requests a PKC from the Admin, 
   providing the generated public key.

   5) Enrollment [E]. The Admin forwards the enrollment request to the 
   PKI. 
    
   6) Enrollment Response [E]. The PKI responds to the enrollment 
   request sent in (5), providing either the new PKC that was generated 
   or a suitable error indication. 
    
   7) Enrollment Response [E]. The Admin forwards the enrollment 
   response back to the IPsec Peer. 
    
   8) Enrollment Confirmation. Peer must positively acknowledge receipt 
   of new PKC back to the Admin. 
    
   9) Enrollment Confirmation. Admin forwards enrollment confirmation 
   back to the PKI. 
    
   10) PKC Posting. The newly-generated PKC for IPsec Peer 1 is posted 
   to the repository.  
    
   11) Maintenance [M]. The IPsec Peer accesses the PKI to support look-
   up of PKCs for other IPsec Peers, certification path validation, and 
   revocation checking. This step consists of sending requests for 
   specific PKCs or CRLs, or requests for the PKI System to perform 
   validation checks.[EDITOR's NOTE  is the Admin going to the 
   repository lookup for the IPsec Peer?] 
    
   12) Maintenance Response [M]. The PKI responds to the maintenance 
   request sent in (11), providing either the requested PKC or CRL, 
   indicating the validity status of a PKC, or indicating an error 
   condition. 
    
   13) IKE/IPsec Communication [I]. The Peers communicate authenticated 
   by the PKCs they received from the PKI. 
    
    
3.4.7 Enrollment Method 3: Admin Enrolls to the PKI Directly 
    
   In this instance, the Admin is performing a function similar to that 
   of a Registration Authority (RA), as defined in [CERTPROFILE]. The 
   Admin will have likely generated the key pair and constructed the 
   request on behalf of the IPsec Peer. It proceeds to handle the entire 
   enrollment directly with the PKI, and returns to the IPsec Peer the 
   final product of a key pair and PKC. Again, the mechanism for the 
   Peer to Admin communication is opaque. 
    
   The steps of the VPN-PKI interaction are summarized here for the 
   Admin enrolling directly to the PKI. The letters refer to Figure 3.

                       Admin Performs Enrollment 
    
    
   1) Authorization [A]. Admin sends a list of IDs and PKC contents for 
   the PKI System to authorize enrollment. The PKI returns a list of 
   unique identifiers and one-time tokens to be used for the enrollment 
   of each PKC. Other PKC usage policy is also set at this time, for

   7) PKC Posting. The newly-generated PKC for IPsec Peer 1 is posted to 
   the repository.  
    
   8) Maintenance [M]. The Admin accesses the PKI to retrieve the new 
   PKC.  [EDITOR's NOTE  is the Admin going to the repository lookup 
   for the IPsec Peer?] 
    
   9) Maintenance Response [M]. The PKI responds to the maintenance 
   request sent in (8), providing the requested PKC, or indicating an 
   error condition. 
    
   10) Admin sends newly generated PKC and private key to IPsec Peer. 
    
   11) IKE/IPsec Communication [I]. The Peers communicate authenticated 
   by the PKCs they received from the PKI. 
    
    
3.4.8 Enrollment Type Field 
    
   A field must exist in the request to specify the TYPE of request 
   being made. Request types include new request, renew request, and 
   change request (renewals and changes are discussed in detail in 
   section 3.6). The type field is required for monitoring, logging and 
   auditing purposes. They will help the Operator to know exactly what 
   type of request was made so that suspicious activities, even if the 
   request is denied, can be identified. 
    
3.4.9 Confirmation Handshake 
    
   Any time a new PKC is issued by the PKI, a confirmation must be sent 
   back to the PKI. This is true for first time issuances, renewals, and 
   changes alike. 
    
   Operationally, the Peer MUST send a confirmation to the PKI verifying 
   that the end entity has received the PKC, loaded it, and can use it 
   effectively in an IKE exchange. This requirement exists so that: 
    
     - The PKI does not publish the new PKC in the repository for others 
       until that PKC is able to be used effectively by the Peer, and; 
    
     - A revocation may be invoked if the PKC is not received and 
       operational within an allowable window of time. 
    
   To assert such proof the Peer MUST sign a portion of data with the 
   new key. The result MUST be sent to the PKI. The entity that actually 
   sends the result to the PKI MAY be either the Peer (sending it 
   directly to the PKI) or Admin (the Peer would send it to Admin, and 
   Admin can in turn send it to the PKI). 
    
   The Admin MUST acknowledge the successful receipt of the 
   confirmation, thus signaling the end entity Peer that it may proceed 
   using this PKC in IKE connections. The PKI MUST complete all

   processing necessary to enable the end entity's operational use of 
   the new PKC (for example, writing the PKC to the repository) before 
   sending the confirmation acknowledgement. The PKI MUST also issue a 
   revoke on the original PKC before sending the confirmation ACK (see 
   section 4.X). The end entity Peer MUST NOT begin using the PKC until 
   the PKI's confirmation acknowledgement has been received. 
    
    
3.4.10 Failure Cases 
    
   Thorough error condition descriptions and handling instructions are 
   required for each transaction in the enrollment process. Providing 
   such error codes will greatly aid interoperability efforts between 
   the PKI and IPsec products. 
    
   The profile must clarify what happens if the request and retrieval 
   fails for some reason. The following cases will be covered: 
    
     - Admin or Peer cannot send the request. 
    
     - Admin or Peer sent the request but the PKI did not receive the 
       request. 
    
     - PKI received the request but could not read it effectively. 
    
     - PKI received and read the request, but some contents of the 
       request violated the PKI's configured policy such that the PKI 
       was unable to generate the PKC. 
    
     - The PKI System generated the PKC, but could not send it. 
    
     - The PKI sent the PKC, but the requestor (Admin or Peer) did not 
       receive it. 
    
     - The Requestor (Admin or Peer) received the PKC, but could not 
       process it due to incorrect contents, or other PKC-construction-
       related problem. 
    
     - The Requestor failed trying to generate the confirmation. 
    
     - The Requestor failed trying to send the confirmation. 
    
     - The Requestor sent the confirmation, but the PKI did not receive 
       it. 
    
     - The PKI received the confirmation but could not process. 
    
   In each case the following questions MUST be addressed: 
    
     - What does Peer do? 
     - What does Admin do? 
     - What does PKI do?

     - Is Authorization used? 
    
    
   If a failure occurs after the PKI sends the PKC and before the Peer 
   receives it, then the Peer MUST re-request with the same 
   Authorization ID and one-time-key, and the PKI, seeing the ID and 
   key, MUST send the PKC again. 
    
    
3.5 PKC Profile for PKI Interaction 
    
   A PKC used for identity in IKE transactions MUST include all the 
   X509v3 mandatory fields. It must also contain the minimal contents 
   necessary for path validation and chaining (these items will be 
   enumerated in the profile). 
    
   It is preferable that the PKC profiles for IPsec and certificate 
   management were the same so that one PKC could be used for both 
   protocols. If the profiles are inconsistent then different PKCs (and 
   perhaps different processing requirements) might be required for 
   certificate management transactions vs. IKE transactions. However, 
   failure to achieve this requirement in the profile MUST NOT hold up 
   the standardization effort. 
    
    
3.5.1 Identity Usage 
    
   The IPsec Peer SHALL perform identity verification based on the 
   fields of the PKC and parameters applicable to the VPN tunnel. The 
   fields of the PKC used for verification MAY include either the X.500 
   Distinguished Name (DN) within the Subject Name, or a specific field 
   within the Extension SubjectAltName (per [DOI] 4.6.2.1 Identification 
   Type Values). Usage descriptions for each follow. 
    
   The PKC field(s) that will be used for identity verification MUST be 
   included in the PKC request by the Admin or the Peer. In addition to 
   the DN, the following identity-related values may be included in the 
   SubjectAltName: 
    
     - Fully-Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) 
     - RFC 822 (also called USER FQDN) 
     - IPv4 Address 
     - IPv6 Address 
    
   While substrings of these identity values may also be present in 
   elements of the DN, they will not be looked for in the DN, only in 
   SubjectAltName.

3.5.2 Path Validation 
    
   The Peers must validate the certification path. The contents 
   necessary in the PKC to allow this will be enumerated in the profile 
   document. 
    
   The Peer MAY have the ability to construct the certification path 
   itself, however Admin MUST be able to supply Peers with the trust 
   anchor and any chaining PKCs necessary. The Admin MAY include the AIA 
   extension in PKCs as a means of facilitating path validation. 
    
   DNS SHOULD be supported by the Peers in order to do certification 
   path lookups, as well as those for revocation. 
    
    
3.5.3 KeyUsage 
    
   The PKC's KeyUsage digialSignature bit [CERTPROFILE] MUST be flagged 
   on. 
    
   [EDITOR'S NOTE: Shouldn't the non-repudiation bit also be required? 
   It's in the stated requirements, and PKIX treats it separately. Also 
   check whether the key exchange or key agreement bits should be 
   required. These are employed by both CMC and IPsec.] 
    
    
3.5.4 Extended Key Usage 
    
   EKU's are not required. The presence or lack of an EKU MUST NOT cause 
   an implementation to fail an IKE connection. 
    
   Default behavior is to not check EKU. However, local security policy 
   MAY check EKU, and if so the implementation SHOULD allow the 
   acceptance or rejection based on the presence of each EKU. Those EKUs 
   are defined as: 
    
     - serverAuth, 
     - clientAuth, 
    
   or an IKE specific EKU which are defined as one of the four currently 
   issued IANA EKU's: 
    
     - IPsec user, 
     - IPsec computer, 
     - IPsec intermediate, 
     - IKE IPsec intermediate.

3.5.5 Pointer to Revocation Checking 
    
   The PKC contents must be constructed in a manner such that any Peer 
   who hold the PKC locally will know exactly where to go and how to 
   request the CRL. 
    
   The location and method for either a CDP or an AIA [CERTPROFILE] MUST 
   be included in the PKC. Including such contents avoids the need to 
   send the CRL to the Peer, and allows the receiving Peer to look up 
   the CRL on their own. 
    
   PKCs MUST contain the full name of the CDP and AIA. Issuer-relative 
   names are not considered sufficient. 
    
    
3.6 PKC Renewals and Changes 
    
   In order to allow for continued PKC usage, a new PKC will need to be 
   issued for an end entity before the end entity's currently held PKC 
   expires. A renewal is defined as a new PKC issuance with the same 
   SubjectName and SubjectAlternativeName contents as an existing PKC 
   for the same end entity before expiration of the end entity's current 
   PKC. 
    
   A change is defined as a new PKC issuance with an altered SubjectName 
   or SubjectAlternativeName for the same end entity before expiration 
   of the end entity's current PKC. Renewals and changes are variants of 
   a PKC request scenario with unique operational and management 
   requirements. 
    
   Once the PKI has issued a PKC for the end entity Peer, the Peer MUST 
   be able to either contact the PKI directly or through the Admin for 
   any subsequent renewals or changes. The PKI MUST support either case. 
    
   It is desired that a renew or change request contain an element that 
   identifies the request as either type=renewal, or type=change. This 
   element MUST be specified in the profile. This will allow for better 
   management, logging and auditing of certificate management. 
    
   When sending a renew or change request, the entire contents of the 
   PKC request needs to be sent to the PKI, just as in the case of the 
   original enrollment. Keeping the request format as similar as 
   possible between new, renewal, and change cases will make for easier 
   implementations; e.g. the format of the request is identitical except 
   for a type=[renew | change] instead of type=new. 
    
   The renew and change requests MUST be signed by the private key of 
   the old PKC. This will allow the PKI to verify the identity of the 
   requestor, and ensure that an attacker does not submit a request and 
   receive a PKC with another end entity's identity.

Internet-Draft            Requirements for an               July 2004 
                  IPsec Certificate Management Profile 
                                     
   Whether or not a new key is used for the new PKC in a renew and 
   change scenario is a matter of local security policy, and MUST be 
   specified by the Admin to the PKI in the original authorization 
   request. Re-using the same key is permitted, but not encouraged. If a 
   new key is used, the change or renew request must be signed by both 
   the old key -- to prove the right to make the request -- and the new 
   key -- to use for the new PKC. [EDITOR'S NOTE: Is there a way to do 
   this?] 
    
   The new PKC resulting from a renew or change will be retrieved in-
   band, using the same mechanism as a new PKC request. 
    
   For the duration of time after a renew or change has been processed 
   and before PKI has received confirmation of the Peer's successful 
   receipt of the new PKC (as described above in section 3.4.9), both 
   PKCs--the old and the new--for the end entity will be valid. This 
   will allow the Peer to continue with uninterrupted IKE connections 
   with the previous PKC while the renewal process occurs. 
    
   In the case where new keys were generated for a renew or change 
   request, once the end entity Peer receives the confirmation 
   acknowledgement from the PKI, it is good practice for the old key 
   pair be destroyed as soon as possible. Deletion of the keys and the 
   PKC can occur once all connections that used the old PKC have 
   expired. 
    
   After the renewal or change occurs, the question now exists for the 
   PKI of what to do about the old PKC. If the old PKC is to be made 
   unusable, the PKI will need to add it to the revocation list and 
   removed from the repository. The decision about if the old PKC should 
   be made unusable is a decision of local policy. Either the PKI or the 
   Admin will need to specify this parameter during the authorization 
   phase. In this case the specifying party --either the Admin or the 
   PKI-- MUST also specify during authorization the length of time after 
   the PKI receives the end entity Peer's confirmation (of receipt of 
   the PKC) that will pass before the old PKC is made unusable. 
    
   If a PKC has been revoked, it MUST NOT be allowed a renewal or 
   change. 
    
   Should the PKC expire without renewal or change, an entirely new 
   request MUST be made. 
    
    
3.6.1 Renew Request for a New PKC (before expiry) 
    
   Operators can choose to force renewals for several reasons: 
    
     - To enforce an automated "clean up" of unused PKCs that have not 
       been specifically revoked 
    
     - To force re-keys

     - To have manual review control over re-issuance. 
    
   In the latter case, automated renewals will likely not be used. In 
   the former two cases automated renewal is a very attractive option. 
    
   At the time of authorization, certain details about renewal 
   acceptance will be conveyed by the Admin to the PKI, as stated in 
   section 3.2.3.2 above. The renewal request MUST match the conditions 
   that were specified in the original authorization for: 
    
     - Keys: new or existing or either 
     - Requestor: End entity Peer, Admin, either 
     - Renewal Period 
     - Length of time before making the old PKC unusable 
    
   If any of these conditions are not met, the PKI must reject the 
   renewal and log the event. 
    
    
3.6.2 Change Request for a New PKC 
    
   A change in contents will be necessary when details about an end 
   entity Peer's identity change, but the Operator does not want to 
   generate a new PKC from scratch, requiring a whole new authorization. 
   For example, a gateway device may be moved from one site to another. 
   Its IPv4 Address will change in the SubjectAltName extension, but all 
   other information could stay the same. Another example is an end user 
   who gets married and changes the last name or moves from one 
   department to another. In either case, only one field (the Surname or 
   OU in the DN) need change. 
    
   A Change differs from a Renew in a few ways: 
    
     - A re-key is not necessary (though MAY be specified)  
    
     - The timing of the Change event is not predictable, as is the case 
       with a scheduled renewal 
    
     - The change request may occur at any time during a PKC's period of 
       validity  
    
     - Once the Change is completed, and the new PKC is confirmed, the 
       old PKC should cease to be usable, as its contents no longer 
       accurately describe the subject 
    
     - The existence of a "change" type allows for better logging and 
       tracking of why the new issuance occurred, and why the old PKC 
       was made unusable.  
    
   At the time of authorization, certain details about change acceptance 
   MAY be conveyed by the Admin to the PKI, as stated in section 3.2.3.2

   above. The change request MUST match the conditions that were 
   specified in the original authorization for: 
    
     - Keys: new or existing or either 
     - Requestor: End entity Peer, Admin, either 
     - The fields in the Subject and SubjectAltName that are changeable 
     - Length of time before making the old PKC unusable 
    
   If any of these conditions are not met, the PKI must reject the 
   renewal. 
    
   If a Change authorization was not made at the time of original 
   authorization, one may be made from Admin to the PKI at any time 
   during the PKC's valid life. When such a Change is desired, Admin 
   must notify the PKI System that a chance is authorized for the end 
   entity, and to expect it coming, and specify the new contents. Admin 
   then initiates the Change request with the given contents in whatever 
   mechanism the VPN System employs (direct from end entity to PKI, from 
   end entity through Admin, or directly from Admin). 
    
    
3.6.3 Error Handling for Renewal and Change 
    
   Thorough error condition descriptions and handling instructions are 
   required for each transaction in the renewal or change process. 
   Providing such error codes will greatly aid interoperability efforts 
   between the PKI and IPsec products.  
    
    
3.7 Finding PKCs in repositories 
    
   The complete hierarchical validation chain (except the trust point) 
   MUST be able to be searched in their respective repositories. The 
   information to accomplish these searches MUST be adequately 
   communicated in the PKCs sent during the IKE transaction. 
    
   All PKCs must be retrievable through a single protocol. The final 
   specification will identify one protocol as a "MUST", others MAY be 
   listed as "OPTIONAL". 
    
   The general requirements for the retrieval protocol include: 
    
     - The protocol can be easily Firewalled (including NAT or PAT); 
    
     - The protocol can easily perform some query against a remote 
       repository on a specific ID element that was given to it in a 
       standard PKC field. 
    
   Other considerations include: 
    
     -relative speed 
     -relative ease of administration

     -scalability 
    
   Intermediate PKCs will be needed for the case of re-keying of the CA, 
   or a PKI System where multiple CAs exist. 
    
   PKCs MAY have extendedKeyusage to help identify the proper PKC for 
   IPsec, though the default behavior is to not use them. See the above 
   section on extendedKeyUsage. 
    
   IPsec Peers MUST be able to resolve Internet domain names and support 
   the manadatory repository access protocol at the time of starting up 
   so they can perform the PKC lookups. 
    
   IPsec Peers should cache PKCs to reduce latency in setting up Phase 
   1. Note that this is an operational issue, not an interoperability 
   issue. 
    
   The use case for accomplishing lookups when PKCs are not sent in IKE 
   is a stated non-goal of the profile at this time. 
    
    
3.7.1 Error Handling for Repository Lookups 
    
   Thorough error condition descriptions and handling instructions are 
   required for each transaction in the repository lookup process. 
   Providing such error codes will greatly aid interoperability efforts 
   between the PKI and IPsec products.  
    
    
3.8 Revocation Action 
    
   The Peer MUST be able to initiate revocation for its own PKC. In this 
   case the revocation request MUST be signed by the Peer's current key 
   pair for the PKC it wishes to revoke. Whether the actual revocation 
   request transaction occurs directly with the PKI or is first sent to 
   Admin who proxies or forwards the request to the PKI is a matter of 
   implementation. 
    
   The Admin MUST be able to initiate revocation for any PKC for which 
   it authorized the creation. The Admin will identify itself to the PKI 
   by use of its own PKC; it MUST sign any revocation request to the PKI 
   with the private key from its own PKC. The PKI MUST have the ability 
   to configure Admin(s) with revocation authority, as identified by its 
   PKC. Any PKC authorizations must specify if said PKC may be revoked 
   by the Admin (see section 3.2.3.2 for more details). 
    
   The profile MUST identify the one protocol or transaction within a 
   protocol to be used for both Peer and Admin initiated revocations. 
    
   The profile MUST identify the size of CRL the client will be prepared 
   to support.

                  IPsec Certificate Management Profile 
                                     
   Below are guidelines for revocation in specific transactions:  
    
     - AFTER RENEW, BEFORE EXPIRATION: The PKI MUST be responsible for 
       the PKC revocation during a renew transaction. PKI MUST revoke 
       the PKC after receiving the confirm notification from the Peer, 
       and before sending the confirm-ack to the Peer. The Peer MUST 
       NOT revoke its own PKC in this case. 
    
     - AFTER CHANGE, BEFORE EXPIRATION: The PKI MUST be responsible for 
       the PKC revocation during a change transaction. PKI MUST revoke 
       the PKC after receiving the confirm notification from the Peer, 
       and before sending the confirm-ack to the Peer. The Peer MUST 
       NOT revoke its own PKC in this case. 
    
    
3.9 Revocation Checking and Status Information 
    
   The PKI System MUST provide a mechanism whereby Peers can check the 
   revocation status of PKCs that are presented to it for IKE identity. 
   The mechanism should allow for access to extremely fresh revocation 
   information. CRLs have been chosen as the mechanism for communicating 
   this information. Operators are RECOMMENDED to refresh CRLs as often 
   as logistically possible. 
    
   A single manadatory protocol mechanism for performing CRL lookups 
   MUST be specified by the final specification. 
    
   All PKCs used in IKE MUST have cRLDistributionPoint and 
   authorityInfoAccess fields populated with valid URLs. This will allow 
   all recipients of the PKC to know immediately how revocation is to be 
   accomplished, and where to find the revocation information. The AIA 
   is needed in an environment where multiple layers of CAs exist and 
   for the case of a CA key roll-over. 
    
   IPsec Systems have an OPTION to turn off revocation checking. Such 
   may be desired when the two Peers are communicating over a network 
   without access to the CRL service, such as at a trade show, in a lab, 
   or in a demo environment. If revocation checking is OFF, the 
   implementation MUST proceed to use the PKC as valid identity in the 
   exchange and need not perform any check. 
    
   If the revocation of a PKC is used as the only means of deactivation 
   of access authorization for the Peer (or user), then the speed of 
   deactivation will be as rapid as the refresh rate of the CRL issued 
   and published by the PKI. If more immediate deactivation of access is 
   required than the CRL refreshing can provide, then another mechanism 
   for authorization that provides more immediate access deactivation 
   should be layered into the VPN deployment. Such a second mechanism is 
   out of the scope of this profile. (Examples are Xauth, L2TP's 
   authentication, etc.).

   It is submitted as an individual draft in order to meet a publication 
   deadline though it has been accepted in to the working group.  The 
   following salient changes were introduced: 
    
     - A new Figure 1 was added in section 2.1 to depict just the VPN 
       System. 
    
     - A new Figure 2 was added to depict 2.2 to depict just the PKI 
       System. 
    
     - The old Figure 1 was moved to section 2.3. 
    
     - Section 2.3 was split in to three sections to depict the New PKC, 
       Renewal, and Revocation.  Also the text was modified to indicate 
       that the pictures are only for IPsec Peers generating key pairs 
       and requesting PKCs. 
    
     - Text and a Figure was added to Section 3.4.6 to show the 
       architectural difference for IPsec Peers enrolling through an 
       Admin.

   This is a revised requirements document based on the existing Project 
   Dploy requirements draft. It adapts the revisions to adapt the Dploy 
   requirements to the scope of the proposed charter for an IETF 
   PKI4IPSEC WG.  It is submitted as an individual draft in anticipation 
   of formation of the WG.  The following salient changes were 
   introduced: 
    
     - Rewrote the abstract to focus on the document rather than the 
       project. 
    
     - Rewrote and trimmed introduction to fit proposed scope of 
       deliverable (2) from IETF PKI4IPSEC charter. 
    
     - Rewrote sentences throughout to genericize the document for the 
       IETF and remove references to Project Dploy objectives. 
    
     - Removed reference to the Dploy Business Case. 
    
     - Removed the "Audience" subsection of the introduction because it 
       was redundant with other aspects of the introduction, and 
       unnecessary with the context of the proposed PKI4IPSEC WG. 
    
     - Added definition of Community Realm (used in 3.2.3.3) to the 
       "Definitions" subsection. 
    
     - Added definition of CRL Distribution Points (CDP) and Authority 
       Info Access (AIA) to the "Definitions" subsection. 
    
     - Restructured the "Architecture" section to bring the presentation 
       of Figure 1 to the front to go along with the overview of the 
       section, and to add a new step diagram to the "VPN-PKI 
       Interaction" subsection. 
    
     - Added a new subsection 2.1.2 to describe the VPN peer. Text of 
       the new subsection will be supplied in a subsequent draft. 
    
     - Added an editor's note to subsection 3.1.2 noting that further 
       elaboration on the nature of "policy details" may be required. 
    
     - Subsection 3.2 was deleted to maintain the focus on generic 
       requirements agreed in Minneapolis. Selection of specific 
       protocols will be done in the deliverable (3) profile. 
    
     - Delete the requirement from 3.2.3.1 to include the maximum CRL 
       size in the certificate template.  This may need to be specified 
       in the profile, but not be in the certificate itself.
