                   YANG Data Model for L2VPN service
                 draft-xie-l3sm-l2vpn-service-model-00

Abstract

   This document provides an example of service yang data model for
   layer 2 provider provisioned VPN service.  Unlike L3VPN, L2VPN
   doesn't provide L3 interface to customer using IP infrastructure or
   doesn't provide IP connectivity between pairs of customer sites.
   Therefore straight augment the l3vpn model with l2vpn parameters may
   not be appropriate.  However [draft-ietf-l3sm-l3vpn-service-model]
   has defined a lot of reusable groupings such as operational-
   requirements, customer-location-info, site-diversity ,site-
   availability,etc.  In this document, we reuse these common groupings
   and add some l2vpn parameters to develop the l2vpn service model.

   Similar to the l3vpn service model, this model provides an abstracted
   view of the Layer 2 service configuration components.  It will be up
   to a management system to take this as an input and use specific
   configurations models to configure the different network elements to
   deliver the service.

1.  Introduction

   Layer 2 VPN emulates the behavior of a local area network (LAN)
   across an internet protocol (IP) or MPLS-enabled IP network allowing
   Ethernet devices to communicate with each other as if they were
   connected to a common LAN segment[RFC4664].  Building a L2VPN system
   requires coordination between the Service Provider and the customer.
   The Service Provider provides L2 connectivity; the customer builds a
   network using data link resources obtained from the Service Provider.
   In an L2VPN service, the Service Provider does not require
   information about a customer's network topology, policies, routing
   information, point-to-point links.

Internet-Draft             L2VPN Service Model              October 2015


   The Service Provider only requires Provider Edge (PE) routers with
   the following capabilities:

   o  Encapsulation of L2 protocol data units (PDU) into layer 3 packets

   o  Inter-connection of any-to-any L2 transports.

   o  Emulation of L2 quality-of-service (QoS) over a packet switch
      network.

   o  Ease of configuration of the L2 service.

   o  Support for different types of tunneling mechanisms (MPLS, L2TPv3,
      IPSec, GRE, and others)

   o  L2VPN process databases include all information related to
      circuits and their connections.

   This document provides an example of service model for Layer 2 VPN
   service.  It can be used by a management system as an input then
   choice suited configurations models to configure the different
   network elements to deliver the service.

    <type> is the name of the type for leafs and leaf-lists

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS.  Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance.

2.1.  Terminologies

   VPLS  A VPLS is a provider service that emulates the full
      functionality of a traditional Local Area Network (LAN).  A VPLS
      makes it possible to interconnect several LAN segments over a
      packet switched network (PSN) and makes the remote LAN segments
      behave as one single LAN.


   VPW  A Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS) is a point-to-point
      circuit (link) connecting two Customer Edge devices.  The link is
      established as a logical through a packet switched network.  The
      CE in the customer network is connected to a PE in the provider
      network via an Attachment Circuit; the Attachment Circuit is
      either a physical or a logical circuit.

3.  L2VPN and L3VPN comparison

   There are two fundamentally different kinds of Layer 2 VPN service
   that a service provider could offer to a customer: Virtual Private
   Wire Service (VPWS) and Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS).  There is
   also the possibility of an IP-only LAN-like Service (IPLS)[RFC4664].
   The VPN service must match the type of service required by the VPN
   user.  Different VPN solutions offer either layer 2 or layer 3
   connectivity between VPN sites.

   Below is a table for comparison analysis between L2VPN and L3VPN
   service.

4.  Layer 2 VPN service model design

4.1.  Reuse the groupings defined in L3SM service model

   [RFC3809] provides requirements that are generic to both Layer 2
   Virtual Private Networks (L2VPN) and Layer 3 Virtual Private Networks
   (L3VPN).These requirements are independent of any particular type of
   PPVPN technology and include service, provider and engineering
   requirements.  In this document, we reuse some common groupings
   corresponding to these requirements which are defined in the [L3VPN-
   svc].

   The following table summarizes the common grouping which are used in
   this document:

Internet-Draft             L2VPN Service Model              October 2015


   grouping name:

   vpn-svc-cfg
   operational-requirements
   customer-location-info
   site-diversity
   site-availability
   site-management
   site-vpn-policy
   site-security-authentication
   site-security-encryption
   site-security-acl
   site-service-protection
   site-service-mpls
   site-service-multicast

4.2.  Customer lan connection

   In this document, we analyzed the different of L2VPN and L3VPN in
   section 2.  The major different is traffic type and connectivity
   type, e.g., Layer 2 services is usually based on frame relay and
   asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) while Layer 3 service is based on
   IPv4 and IPv6.

   In Layer 2 VPN, The VC labels are used by the PE routers for
   demultiplexing traffic arriving from different L2VPN services over
   the same set of tunnel/PW.  And the MAC address also be used in the
   layer 2 customer lan connection:

         |  +--rw customer-specific-information
         |  |  ......
         |  |  +--rw customer-lan-connection* [address]
         |  |  |  +--rw address         union
         |  |  |  +--rw lan-protocol?   identityref
         |  |  |  +--rw vc-label?       string
         |  |  |  +--rw mac-address?    yang:mac-address

4.3.  Attachment

   In layer 2 VPN, the physical parameters of the attachment may be a
   Frame Relay DLCI, an ATM VPI/VCI, an Ethernet port, a VLAN, a PPP
   connection on a physical interface, etc.  To make it easy to be
   extended, in this document we define a bearer identity and several
   other identities which are base on the bearer identity:

      identity bearer{
       description
           "base identity of bearer.";
      }

      identity ems{
       base bearer;
           description
           "identity of vpls ethernet mulitpoint service.";
      }

      identity emrs{
       base bearer;
       description

      }

      identity fr{
       base bearer;
           description
           "identity of Frame Relay";
      }

      identity ethernet{
       base bearer;
           description
           "identity of ethernet.";
      }

      identity atm{
       base bearer;
           description
           "identity of ATM.";
      }

      identity ppp-or-hdlc{
       base bearer;
           description
           "identity of PPP/HDLC.";
      }

4.4.  QoS

   For QoS service, the match-flow of L2VPN are quite different from
   L3VPN's.  The source/destination MAC address, local/remote label,
   vlan id may be used:

8.  Conclusion

   This document intends to trigger a discussion at IETF 94 meeting in
   Yokohama on other VPN service modeling.  It uses L2VPN service model
   as an example to explore how L3VPN service model can be used as basis
   to define other type of VPN service models such as Cloud VPN service
   model, OTT VPN service model, Hybrid VPN service model.  Right now
   L3VPN service model defined in L3SM WG follows modularity approach
   and has been defined in more extensible way, therefore other VPN
   service model can reuse building blocks defined in L3SM service model
   without need of reinventing a new wheel.  However L3VPN service model
   can not be directly extended to other VPN service model since it
   include L3VPN specific aspect, e.g., IP connection, QoS filter and
   Routing filter that are applied to IP network.  Therefore we can not
   use L3VPN service model structure as a common structure for other VPN
   service models.
