1.  Introduction

   JMAP ([RFC8620] - JSON Meta Application Protocol) is a generic
   protocol for synchronising data, such as mail, calendars or contacts,
   between a client and a server.  It is optimised for mobile and web
   environments, and provides a consistent interface to different data
   types.

   JMAP for Mail ([RFC8621] - The JSON Meta Application Protocol (JMAP)
   for Mail) specifies a data model for synchronising email data with a
   server using JMAP.  Clients can use this to efficiently search,
   access, organise, and send messages.

   Message Disposition Notifications (MDNs) are defined in [RFC8098] and
   are used as "read receipts", "acknowledgements", or "receipt
   notifications".

   A client can come across MDNs in different ways:

   1.  When receiving an email message, an MDN can be sent to the
       sender.  This specification defines an MDN/send method to cover
       this case.

   2.  When sending an email message, an MDN can be requested.  This
       must be done with the help of a header field, and is already
       specified by [RFC8098] and can already be handled by [RFC8621]
       this way.

   3.  When receiving an MDN, the MDN could be related to an existing
       sent message.  This is already covered by [RFC8621] in the
       EmailSubmission object.  A client might want to display detailed
       information about a received MDN.  This specification defines an
       MDN/parse method to cover this case.

1.1.  Notational conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Type signatures, examples and property descriptions in this document
   follow the conventions established in section 1.1 of [RFC8620].  Data
   types defined in the core specification are also used in this
   document.

   Servers MUST support all properties specified for the new data types
   defined in this document.

1.2.  Terminology

   The same terminology is used in this document as in the core JMAP
   specification.

   Because keywords are case-insensitive in IMAP but case-sensitive in
   JMAP, the "$mdnsent" keyword MUST always be used in lowercase.

1.3.  Addition to the capabilities object

   Capabilities are announced as part of the standard JMAP Session
   resource; see [RFC8620], section 2.  This defines a new capability,
   "urn:ietf:params:jmap:mdn".

   The capability "urn:ietf:params:jmap:mdn" being present in the
   "accountCapabilities" property of an account represents support for
   the "MDN" data type, parsing MDNs via the "MDN/parse" method, and
   creating and sending MDN messages via the "MDN/send" method.  Servers
   that include the capability in one or more "accountCapabilities"
   properties MUST also include the property in the "capabilities"
   property.

   The value of this "urn:ietf:params:jmap:mdn" property is an empty
   object both in the account's "accountCapabilities" property and in
   the "capabilities" property.

2.  MDN

   An *MDN* object has the following properties:

   o  forEmailId: "Id|null" Email id of the received message this MDN is
      relative to.  This property MUST NOT be null for "MDN/send", but
      MAY be null in the response from the "MDN/parse" method.

   o  subject: "String|null" Subject used as "Subject" header field for
      this MDN.

   o  textBody: "String|null" Human readable part of the MDN, as plain
      text.

   o  includeOriginalMessage: "Boolean" (default: false).  If "true",
      the content of the original message will appear in the third
      component of the multipart/report generated for the MDN.  See
      [RFC8098] for details and security considerations.

   o  reportingUA: "String|null" Name of the MUA creating this MDN.  It
      is used to build the MDN Report part of the MDN.  Note that a
      "null" value may have better privacy properties.

   o  disposition: "Disposition" Object containing the diverse MDN
      disposition options.

   o  mdnGateway: "String|null" (server-set) Name of the gateway or MTA
      that translated a foreign (non-Internet) message disposition
      notification into this MDN.

   o  originalRecipient: "String|null" (server-set) Original recipient
      address as specified by the sender of the message for which the
      MDN is being issued.

   o  finalRecipient: "String|null" Recipient for which the MDN is being
      issued.  If set, it overrides the value that would be calculated
      by the server from the Identity defined in the "MDN/Send" method,
      unless explicitly set by the client.

   o  originalMessageId: "String|null" (server-set) Message-ID (the
      [RFC5322] header field, not the JMAP id) of the message for which
      the MDN is being issued.

   o  error: "String[]|null" (server-set) Additional information in the
      form of text messages when the "error" disposition modifier
      appears.

Internet-Draft              JMAP MDN handling               January 2021


   o  extensionFields: "String[String]|null" Object where keys are
      extension-field names and values are extension-field values (see
      [RFC8098] Section 3.3).

   A *Disposition* object has the following properties:

   o  actionMode: "String" This MUST be one of the following strings:
      "manual-action" / "automatic-action"

   o  sendingMode: "String" This MUST be one of the following strings:
      "mdn-sent-manually" / "mdn-sent-automatically"

   o  type: "String" This MUST be one of the following strings:
      "deleted" / "dispatched" / "displayed" / "processed"

   See [RFC8098] for the exact meaning of these different fields.  These
   fields are defined case insensitive in [RFC8098] but are case
   sensitive in this RFC and MUST be converted to lowercase by "MDN/
   parse".

2.1.  MDN/send

   The MDN/send method sends an [RFC5322] message from an MDN object.
   When calling this method the "using" property of the Request object
   MUST contain the capabilities "urn:ietf:params:jmap:mdn" and
   "urn:ietf:params:jmap:mail"; the latter because of the implicit call
   to Email/set and the use of Identities, described below.  The method
   takes the following arguments:

   o  accountId: "Id" The id of the account to use.

   o  identityId: "Id" The id of the Identity to associate with these
      MDNs.  The server will use this identity to define the sender of
      the MDNs and to set the finalRecipient field.

   o  send: "Id[MDN]" A map of creation id (client specified) to MDN
      objects.

   o  onSuccessUpdateEmail: "Id[PatchObject]|null" A map of id to an
      object containing properties to update on the Email object
      referenced by the "MDN/send" if the sending succeeds.  This will
      always be a backward reference to the creation id (see example
      below in Section 3.1).

   The response has the following arguments:

   o  accountId: "Id" The id of the account used for the call.

Internet-Draft              JMAP MDN handling               January 2021


   o  sent: "Id[MDN]|null" A map of creation id to MDN containing any
      properties that were not set by the client.  This includes any
      properties that were omitted by the client and thus set to a
      default by the server.  This argument is null if no MDN objects
      were successfully sent.

   o  notSent: "Id[SetError]|null" A map of the creation id to a
      SetError object for each record that failed to be sent, or null if
      all successful.

   In this context, the existing SetError types defined in [RFC8620] and
   [RFC8621] are interpreted as follows:

   o  notFound: The reference Email id cannot be found, or has no valid
      "Disposition-Notification-To" header field.

   o  forbidden: MDN/send would violate an ACL or other permissions
      policy.

   o  forbiddenFrom: The user is not allowed to use the given
      finalRecipient property.

   o  overQuota: MDN/send would exceed a server-defined limit on the
      number or total size of sent MDNs.  It could include limitations
      on sent messages.

   o  tooLarge: MDN/send would result in an MDN that exceeds a server-
      defined limit for the maximum size of an MDN, or more generally on
      email message.

   o  rateLimit: Too many MDNs or email messages have been created
      recently, and a server-defined rate limit has been reached.  It
      may work if tried again later.

   o  invalidProperties: The record given is invalid in some way.

   The following is a new SetError:

   o  mdnAlreadySent: The message has the "$mdnsent" keyword already
      set.

   If the accountId or identityId given cannot be found, the method call
   is rejected with an "invalidArguments" error.

   The client MUST NOT issue an MDN/send request if the message has the
   "$mdnsent" keyword set.

   When sending the MDN, the server is in charge of generating the
   "originalRecipient" and "originalMessageId" fields according to the
   [RFC8098] specification. "finalRecipient" will also generally be
   generated by the server based on the provided identity, but if
   specified by the client and allowed (see Section 5) the server will
   use the client provided value.

   The client is expected to explicitly update each "Email" for which an
   "MDN/send" has been invoked in order to set the "$mdnsent" keyword on
   these messages.  To ensure that, the server MUST reject an "MDN/send"
   which does not result in setting the keyword "$mdnsent".  Thus the
   server MUST check that the "onSuccessUpdateEmail" property of the
   method is correctly set to update this keyword.

2.2.  MDN/parse

   This method allows a client to parse blobs as [RFC5322] messages to
   get MDN objects.  This can be used to parse and get detailed
   information about blobs referenced in the "mdnBlobIds" of the
   EmailSubmission object, or any email message the client could expect
   to be an MDN.

   The "forEmailId" property can be null or missing if the
   "originalMessageId" property is missing or does not refer to an
   existing message, or if the server cannot efficiently calculate the
   related message (for example, if several messages get the same
   "Message-Id" header field).

   The MDN/parse method takes the following arguments:

   o  accountId: "Id" The id of the account to use.

   o  blobIds: "Id[]" The ids of the blobs to parse.

   The response has the following arguments:

   o  accountId: "Id" The id of the account used for the call.

   o  parsed: "Id[MDN]|null" A map of blob id to parsed MDN
      representation for each successfully parsed blob, or null if none.

   o  notParsable: "Id[]|null" A list of ids given that corresponded to
      blobs that could not be parsed as MDNs, or null if none.

   o  notFound: "Id[]|null" A list of blob ids given that could not be
      found, or null if none.

Internet-Draft              JMAP MDN handling               January 2021


   The following additional errors may be returned instead of the MDN/
   parse response:

   o  requestTooLarge: The number of ids requested by the client exceeds
      the maximum number the server is willing to process in a single
      method call.

   o  invalidArguments: If the accountId given cannot be found, the MDN
      parsing is rejected with an "invalidArguments" error.

3.  Samples

3.1.  Sending an MDN for a received email message

   A client can use the following request to send an MDN back to the
   sender:

       [[ "MDN/send", {
         "accountId": "ue150411c",
         "identityId": "I64588216",
         "send": {
           "k1546": {
             "forEmailId": "Md45b47b4877521042cec0938",
             "subject": "Read receipt for: World domination",
             "textBody": "This receipt shows that the email has been
                 displayed on your recipient's computer. There is no
                 guaranty it has been read or understood.",
             "reportingUA": "joes-pc.cs.example.com; Foomail 97.1",
             "disposition": {
               "actionMode": "manual-action",
               "sendingMode": "mdn-sent-manually",
               "type": "displayed"
             },
             "extension": {
               "EXTENSION-EXAMPLE": "example.com"
             }
           }
         },
         "onSuccessUpdateEmail": {
           "#k1546": {
             "keywords/$mdnsent": true
           }
         }
       }, "0" ]]

   If the email id matches an existing email message without the
   "$mdnsent" keyword, the server can answer:

           "Md45b47b4877521042cec0938": {}
         }
       }, "0" ]]

   If the "$mdnsent" keyword has already been set, the server can answer
   an error:

        [[ "MDN/send", {
          "accountId": "ue150411c",
          "notSent": {
            "k1546": {
              "type": "mdnAlreadySent",
              "description" : "$mdnsent keyword is already present"
            }
          }
        }, "0" ]]

3.2.  Asking for MDN when sending an email message

   This is done with the [RFC8621] "Email/set" "create" method.

         "subject": "World domination",
         ...
       }
     }
   }, "0" ]]

   Note the specified "Disposition-Notification-To" header field
   indicating where to send MDN back (usually the sender of the
   message).

3.3.  Parsing a received MDN

   The client issues a parse request:

          [[ "MDN/parse", {
            "accountId": "ue150411c",
            "blobIds": [ "0f9f65ab-dc7b-4146-850f-6e4881093965" ]
          }, "0" ]]

   The server responds:

       }, "0" ]]

   In case of a not found blobId, the server would respond:

         [[ "MDN/parse", {
           "accountId": "ue150411c",
           "notFound": [ "0f9f65ab-dc7b-4146-850f-6e4881093965" ]
         }, "0" ]]

   If the blobId has been found but is not parsable, the server would
   respond:

        [[ "MDN/parse", {
          "accountId": "ue150411c",
          "notParsable": [ "0f9f65ab-dc7b-4146-850f-6e4881093965" ]
        }, "0" ]]

Internet-Draft              JMAP MDN handling               January 2021


   Change Controller: IETF

   Security and privacy considerations: this document, section 5.

4.2.  JMAP Error Codes Registry

   This section registers one new error code in the "JMAP Error Codes"
   registry, as defined in [RFC8620].

   JMAP Error Code: mdnAlreadySent

   Intended use: common

   Change controller: IETF

   Reference: This document, Section 2.1

   Description: The message has the "$mdnsent" keyword already set.  The
   client MUST NOT try again to send an MDN for this message.

5.  Security considerations

   The same considerations regarding MDN (see [RFC8098] and [RFC3503])
   apply to this document.

   In order to reinforce trust regarding the relation between the user
   sending an email message and the identity of this user, the server
   SHOULD validate in conformance to the provided Identity that the user
   is permitted to use the finalRecipient value and return a
   forbiddenFrom error if not.
