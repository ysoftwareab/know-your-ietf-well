1.  Introduction

   The Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) [RFC3977] has been using
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] (along with its precursor,
   Secure Sockets Layer or SSL) since at least year 2000.  The use of
   TLS in NNTP was formalized in [RFC4642], providing at the same time
   implementation recommendations.  In order to address the evolving
   threat model on the Internet today, this document provides stronger
   recommendations regarding that use.

Internet-Draft             Use of TLS in NNTP              February 2017


   In particular, this document updates [RFC4642] by specifying that
   NNTP implementations and deployments MUST follow the best current
   practices documented in the "Recommendations for Secure Use of TLS
   and DTLS" [RFC7525].  This includes stronger recommendations
   regarding SSL/TLS protocol versions, fallback to lower versions, TLS
   negotiation, TLS-level compression, TLS session resumption, cipher
   suites, public key lengths, forward secrecy, hostname validation,
   certificate verification, and other aspects of using TLS with NNTP.

   [[Q1: For RFC Editor: Throughout the document, should [RFC7525] be
   referenced as [BCP195] or [RFC7525]?  Same question for other BCP
   documents.]]

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   Any term not defined in this document has the same meaning as it does
   in [RFC4642] or the NNTP core specification [RFC3977].

   When this document uses the terms "implicit TLS", it refers to TLS
   negotiation immediately upon connection on a separate port.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

1.2.  Author's Note

   Please write the first letter of "Elie" with an acute accent wherever
   possible -- it is U+00C9 ("&#201;" in XML).  The third letter of
   "Stephane" and the penultimate letter of "allee" similarly have an
   acute accent (U+00E9, "&#233;" in XML).  Also, the letters "ae" in
   "Baeuerle" should be written as an a-umlaut (U+00E4, "&#228;" in
   XML).

2.  Updates/Changes to RFC 4642

   This document updates [RFC4642] in the following aspects:

   o  NNTP implementations and deployments SHOULD disable TLS-level
      compression (Section 3.3 of [RFC7525]), thus no longer using TLS
      as a means to provide data compression (contrary to Abstract and
      Section 2.2.2 of [RFC4642]).

   o  NNTP implementations and deployments SHOULD prefer implicit TLS
      and therefore use strict TLS configuration (Section 3.2 of
      [RFC7525]), that is to say they SHOULD use a port dedicated to
      NNTP over TLS, and begin the TLS negotiation immediately upon

      connection (contrary to a dynamic upgrade from unencrypted to TLS-
      protected traffic via the use of the STARTTLS command, as
      Section 1 of [RFC4642] was encouraging).  Implicit TLS is the
      preferred way of using TLS with NNTP for the same reasons,
      transposed to NNTP, as those given in Appendix A of [MUA-STS].
      (Note that [MUA-STS] and [RFC4642] have one author in common.)

   o  NNTP implementations and deployments MUST NOT negotiate RC4 cipher
      suites ([RFC7465]) contrary to Section 5 of [RFC4642] that
      required them to implement the TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5 cipher
      suite so as to ensure that any two NNTP compliant implementations
      can be configured to interoperate.  This document removes that
      requirement, so that NNTP client and server implementations follow
      the recommendations given in Sections 4.2 and 4.2.1 of [RFC7525]
      instead.  The mandatory-to-implement cipher(s) suite(s) depend on
      the TLS protocol version.  For instance, when TLS 1.2 is used, the
      TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA cipher suite MUST be implemented
      (Section 9 of [RFC5246]).

   o  All NNTP clients and any NNTP server that is known by multiple
      names MUST support the Server Name Indication (SNI) extension
      defined in Section 3 of [RFC6066], in conformance with Section 3.6
      of [RFC7525].  It was only a "SHOULD" in Section 2.2.2 of
      [RFC4642].

   o  NNTP implementations and deployments MUST follow the rules and
      guidelines defined in [RFC6125] and [RFC5280] for hostname
      validation and certificate verification.  Part of Section 5 of
      [RFC4642] is therefore rationalized in favour of following those
      two documents.

   Appendix A of this document gives detailed changes with regards to
   the wording of [RFC4642].

3.  Recommendations

   The best current practices documented in the "Recommendations for
   Secure Use of TLS and DTLS" [RFC7525] are included here by reference.
   Therefore, NNTP implementations and deployments compliant with this
   document are REQUIRED to also comply with [RFC7525].

   Instead of repeating those recommendations here, this document mostly
   provides supplementary information regarding secure implementation
   and deployment of NNTP technologies.

Internet-Draft             Use of TLS in NNTP              February 2017


3.1.  Compression

   NNTP supports the use of the COMPRESS command, defined in Section 2.2
   of [RFC8054], to compress data between an NNTP client and server.
   Although this NNTP extension might have slightly stronger security
   properties than TLS-level compression [RFC3749] (since NNTP
   compression can be activated after authentication has completed, thus
   reducing the chances that authentication credentials can be leaked
   via for instance a Compression Ratio Info-leak Made Easy (CRIME)
   attack, as described in Section 2.6 of [CRIME]), this document
   neither encourages nor discourages the use of the NNTP COMPRESS
   extension.

3.2.  Protocol Versions and Security Preferences

   NNTP implementations of news servers are encouraged to support
   options to configure the minimal TLS protocol version to accept, and
   which cipher suites, signature algorithms or groups (like elliptic
   curves) to use for incoming connections.  Additional options can
   naturally also be supported.  The goal is to enable administrators of
   news servers to easily and quickly strengthen security, if need be
   (for instance by rejecting cipher suites considered unsafe with
   regards to local policy).

   News clients may also support similar options, either configurable by
   the user or enforced by the news reader.

3.3.  Server Name Indication

   The TLS extension for Server Name Indication (SNI) defined in
   Section 3 of [RFC6066] MUST be implemented by all news clients.  It
   also MUST be implemented by any news server that is known by multiple
   names.  (Otherwise, it is not possible for a server with several
   hostnames to present the correct certificate to the client.)

3.4.  Prevention of SSL Stripping

   In order to help prevent SSL Stripping attacks (Section 2.1 of
   [RFC7457]), NNTP implementations and deployments MUST follow the
   recommendations provided in Section 3.2 of [RFC7525].  Notably, in
   case implicit TLS is not used, news clients SHOULD attempt to
   negotiate TLS even if the server does not advertise the STARTTLS
   capability label in response to the CAPABILITIES command (Section 2.1
   of [RFC4642]).

Internet-Draft             Use of TLS in NNTP              February 2017


3.5.  Authenticated Connections

   [RFC4642] already provides recommendations and requirements for
   certificate validation in the context of checking the client or the
   server's identity.  Those requirements are strengthened by
   Appendix A.5 of this document.

   Wherever possible, it is best to prefer certificate-based
   authentication (along with SASL [RFC4422]), and ensure that:

   o  Clients authenticate servers.

   o  Servers authenticate clients.

   o  Servers authenticate other peer servers.

   This document does not mandate certificate-based authentication,
   although such authentication is strongly preferred.  As mentioned in
   Section 2.2.2 of [RFC4642], the AUTHINFO SASL command (Section 2.4 of
   [RFC4643]) with the EXTERNAL mechanism (Appendix A of [RFC4422]) MAY
   be used to authenticate a client once its TLS credentials have been
   successfully exchanged.

   Given the pervasiveness of eavesdropping [RFC7258], even an encrypted
   but unauthenticated connection might be better than an unencrypted
   connection (this is similar to the "better-than-nothing security"
   approach for IPsec [RFC5386], and in accordance with opportunistic
   security principles [RFC7435]).  Encrypted but unauthenticated
   connections include connections negotiated using anonymous
   Diffie-Hellman mechanisms or using self-signed certificates, among
   others.

   Note: when an NNTP server receives a Netnews article, it MAY add a
   <diag-match> (Section 3.1.5 of [RFC5536]), which appears as "!!" in
   the Path header field of that article, to indicate that it verified
   the identity of the client or peer server.  This document encourages
   the construction of such Path header fields, as described in
   Section 3.2.1 of [RFC5537].

3.6.  Human Factors

   NNTP clients SHOULD provide ways for end users (and NNTP servers
   SHOULD provide ways for administrators) to complete at least the
   following tasks:

   o  Determine if a given incoming or outgoing connection is encrypted
      using a security layer (either using TLS or an SASL mechanism that
      negotiates a security layer).



Elie                     Expires August 11, 2017                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft             Use of TLS in NNTP              February 2017


   o  Be warned if the version of TLS used for encryption of a given
      stream is not secure enough.

   o  If authenticated encryption is used, determine how the connection
      was authenticated or verified.

   o  Be warned if the certificate offered by an NNTP server cannot be
      verified.

   o  Be warned if the cipher suite used to encrypt a connection is not
      secure enough.

   o  Be warned if the certificate changes for a given server.

   o  When a security layer is not already in place, be warned if a
      given server stops advertising the STARTTLS capability label in
      response to the CAPABILITIES command (Section 2.1 of [RFC4642])
      whereas it advertised the STARTTLS capability label during any
      previous connection within a (possibly configurable) time frame.
      (Otherwise, a human might not see the warning the first time, and
      the warning would disappear immediately after that.)

   o  Be warned if a failure response to the STARTTLS command is
      received from the server whereas the STARTTLS capability label was
      advertised.

   Note that the last two tasks cannot occur when implicit TLS is used,
   and that the penultimate task helps prevent an attack known as SSL
   Stripping (Section 2.1 of [RFC7457]).

4.  Security Considerations

   Beyond the security considerations already described in [RFC4642],
   [RFC6125] and [RFC7525], the following caveat is worth mentioning
   when not using implicit TLS: NNTP servers need to ensure that they
   are not vulnerable to the STARTTLS command injection vulnerability
   (Section 2.2 of [RFC7457]).  Though this command MUST NOT be
   pipelined, an attacker could pipeline it.  Therefore, NNTP servers
   MUST discard any NNTP command received between the use of STARTTLS
   and the end of TLS negotiation.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not change the formal definition of the STARTTLS
   extension (Section 6 of [RFC4642]).  Nonetheless, as implementations
   of the STARTTLS extension should follow this document, IANA will add
   its reference to the existing STARTTLS label in the NNTP capability

Appendix A.  Detailed Changes to RFC 4642

   This section lists detailed changes this document applies to
   [RFC4642].

A.1.  Related to TLS-level Compression

   The second sentence in the Abstract of [RFC4642] is replaced with the
   following text:

      The primary goal is to provide encryption for single-link
      confidentiality purposes, but data integrity, and (optional)
      certificate-based peer entity authentication are also possible.

   The second sentence of the first paragraph in Section 2.2.2 of
   [RFC4642] is replaced with the following text:

      The STARTTLS command is usually used to initiate session security,
      although it can also be used for client and/or server certificate
      authentication.

A.2.  Related to Implicit TLS

   The third and fourth paragraphs in Section 1 of [RFC4642] are
   replaced with the following text:

      TCP port 563 is dedicated to NNTP over TLS, and registered in the
      IANA Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry for
      that usage.  NNTP implementations using TCP port 563 begin the TLS
      negotiation immediately upon connection and then continue with the
      initial steps of an NNTP session.  This immediate TLS negotiation
      on a separate port (referred to in this document as "implicit
      TLS") is the preferred way of using TLS with NNTP.

      If a host wishes to offer separate servers for transit and reading
      clients (Section 3.4.1 of [NNTP]), TCP port 563 SHOULD be used for
      implicit TLS with the reading server, and an unused port of its
      choice different than TCP port 433 SHOULD be used for implicit TLS
      with the transit server.  The ports used for implicit TLS should
      be clearly communicated to the clients, and specifically that no
      plain-text communication occurs before the TLS session is
      negotiated.

      As some existing implementations negotiate TLS via a dynamic
      upgrade from unencrypted to TLS-protected traffic during an NNTP
      session on well-known TCP ports 119 or 433, this specification
      formalizes the STARTTLS command in use for that purpose.  However,

      as already mentioned above, implementations SHOULD use implicit
      TLS on a separate port.

      Note: a common alternative to protect NNTP exchanges with transit
      servers that do not implement TLS is the use of IPsec with
      encryption [RFC4301].

   An additional informative reference to [RFC4301] is therefore added
   to Section 7.2 of [RFC4642].

A.3.  Related to RC4 Cipher Suites

   The third paragraph in Section 5 of [RFC4642] is removed.
   Consequently, NNTP no longer requires to implement any cipher suites,
   other than those prescribed by TLS (Section 9 of [RFC5246]) and
   Sections 4.2 and 4.2.1 of [RFC7525].

A.4.  Related to Server Name Indication

   The last two sentences of the seventh paragraph in Section 2.2.2 of
   [RFC4642] are removed.  Section 3.6 of [RFC7525] apply.

A.5.  Related to Certificate Verification

   The text between "During the TLS negotiation" and "identity
   bindings)." in Section 5 of [RFC4642] is replaced with the following
   text:

      During TLS negotiation, the client MUST verify the server's
      identity in order to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.  The
      client MUST follow the rules and guidelines defined in [RFC6125],
      where the reference identifier MUST be the server hostname that
      the client used to open the connection, and that is also specified
      in the TLS "server_name" extension [RFC6066].  The following NNTP-
      specific consideration applies: DNS domain names in server
      certificates MAY contain the wildcard character "*" as the
      complete left-most label within the identifier.

      If the match fails, the client MUST follow the recommendations in
      Section 6.6 of [RFC6125] regarding certificate pinning and
      fallback.

      Beyond server identity checking, clients also MUST apply the
      procedures specified in [RFC5280] for general certificate
      validation (e.g., certificate integrity, signing, and path
      validation).

   Additional normative references to [RFC5280] (replacing [PKI-CERT] it
   obsoletes), [RFC6066], and [RFC6125] are therefore added to
   Section 7.1 of [RFC4642].

A.6.  Related to Other Obsolete Wording

   The first two sentences of the seventh paragraph in Section 2.2.2 of
   [RFC4642] are removed.  There is no special requirement for NNTP with
   regards to TLS Client Hello messages.  Section 7.4.1.2 and Appendix E
   of [RFC5246] apply.

Appendix B.  Acknowledgments

   This document draws heavily on ideas in [RFC7590] by Peter
   Saint-Andre and Thijs Alkemade; a large portion of this text was
   borrowed from that specification.

   The author would like to thank the following individuals for
   contributing their ideas and support for writing this specification:
   Stephane Bortzmeyer, Ben Campbell, Viktor Dukhovni, Stephen Farrell,
   Sabahattin Gucukoglu, Richard Kettlewell, Jouni Korhonen, Mirja
   Kuehlewind, David Eric Mandelberg, Matija Nalis, Chris Newman, and
   Peter Saint-Andre.

   Special thanks to Michael Baeuerle, for shepherding this document,
   and to the Responsible Area Director, Alexey Melnikov, for sponsoring
   it.  They both significantly helped to increase its quality.

Appendix C.  Document History (to be removed by RFC Editor before
             publication)

C.1.  Changes since -04

   o  Take into account the remarks received during IESG telechat.

   o  Mention the Document Shepherd, Michael Baeuerle.

   o  Update the reference [NNTP-COMPRESS] to [RFC8054], now it has been
      released.

   o  Add a reference to [RFC7435].

   o  Move [RFC4422], [RFC4643], [RFC5536], and [RFC5537] from
      informative to normative references.

   o  A few wording improvements.

Internet-Draft             Use of TLS in NNTP              February 2017


C.2.  Changes since -03

   o  Improve wording to make clear that the server hostname that the
      client used to open the connection is the same as the one
      specified in the TLS "server_name" extension.

   o  Move [RFC5280], [RFC6125] and [RFC7525] to normative references.

   o  In detailed changes of [RFC4642], use [NNTP] instead of [RFC3977]
      as this RFC is referenced as [NNTP] in [RFC4642].  Also mention
      obsolete [PKI-CERT].

C.3.  Changes since -02

   o  Use (and define) the "implicit TLS" terminology instead of "strict
      TLS".  The language in [RFC7525] is unfortunate since "strict TLS"
      is not clearly defined in that document, and the name suggests
      that it is an alternative to "opportunistic TLS", rather than an
      alternative to STARTTLS.  While STARTTLS is often used
      opportunistically, that is not always the case.

   o  Mention SSL Stripping in Section 3.6 with a reference to
      Section 2.1 of [RFC7457] because the intent of the related task
      may not have been clear enough.  Reported by Matija Nalis.

   o  Add Section 3.4 about how to prevent SSL stripping, notably by an
      attempt to negotiate TLS even if STARTTLS is not advertised, when
      implicit TLS is not used.

   o  Strengthen the requirements on hostname validation and certificate
      verification, by referencing [RFC6125] and [RFC5280].

   o  Ask IANA to add this document to the NNTP capabilily labels
      registry.

   o  Reference the security considerations of [RFC6125].

   o  Mention informative and normative references to add to [RFC4642].

C.4.  Changes since -01

   o  Take into account all the remarks sent during IETF Last Call.

   o  Move the part about [RFC4642] from Introduction to a new dedicated
      Section named "Updates/Changes to RFC 4642" so as to make the
      document a bit more structured.

Internet-Draft             Use of TLS in NNTP              February 2017


   o  The warning about lack of STARTTLS is expanded in scope to say
      "during any previous connection within a (possibly configurable)
      time frame" instead of "during the previous connection".

   o  Remove Appendix about export restrictions on crypto.  It is
      useless since RFC 2804.

   o  Add wording about the use of strict TLS for transit.  Mention the
      use of a port other than 433 for strict TLS between two peers, and
      add a note about a possible use of IPsec [RFC4301] for transit.
      Do not only speak about port 563.

   o  Explicitly mention the mandatory-to-implement cipher suite for TLS
      1.2.

   o  Do not keep the paragraph about TLS Client Hello messages and
      Server Name Indication (SNI) in [RFC4642].  Support for SNI
      [RFC6066] is now a MUST, and not a SHOULD.

   o  Reference [RFC7457] for the STARTTLS command injection
      vulnerability.

   o  Add notes to RFC Editor to ask that [MUA-STS] and [NNTP-COMPRESS]
      references be changed to their [RFCxxxx] form, once published, and
      whether [BCP195] should be used instead of [RFC7525].

   o  Move [RFC5246] (TLS) to a normative reference.

   o  Minor other wording improvements.

C.5.  Changes since -00

   o  Clarify in the introduction of Section 3 that NNTP implementations
      compliant with this document are REQUIRED to also comply with
      [RFC7525].

   o  Improve the wording of Section 3.2 to mention that configuration
      is primarily intended for news servers.  Also, be more consistent
      in the options to accept, and include signature algorithms and
      named groups.
