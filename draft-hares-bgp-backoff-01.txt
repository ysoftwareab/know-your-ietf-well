Abstract  
        
      This document describes mechanisms for methods for damping the  
      oscillations of BGP-4 [1] peers by increasing the time between  
      automatic start functions of the BGP peers.  The increase of time  
      between automatic start functions will be denoted as a backoff of  
      the automatic start functions by this draft.  
        
      This draft is an informational RFC that provides a description of  
      mechanisms for back-off of the automatic start function in bgp-4  
      peer reconnections. This Informational RFC includes descriptions  
      about the back-off mechanisms and how this information is recorded  
      in the BGP-4 MIB version 2 [1].  
        
      The exponential back-off mechanism contained in this draft was 
      first recorded in a draft of the bgp-4 specification.  The author

1. Overview  
    
      If a BGP speaker detects an error, it shuts down the connection 
      and changes its connection state to Idle. Getting out of the Idle 
      state requires generation of the Start event.  If such an event is 
      generated automatically, then persistent BGP errors may result in 
      persistent flapping of the speaker.  To avoid such a condition it 
      is recommended that automatic start events should not be generated 
      immediately for a peer that was previously transitioned to Idle 
      due to an error. 
    
      For a peer that was previously transitioned to Idle due to an 
      error, the time between consecutive generation of start events, if 
      such events are generated automatically, shall increase.  This 
      increase of time between automatic start events will be called in 
      backoff of automatic BGP peer start events. 
    
    
      The automatic start events listed in the BGP-4 specification are: 
    
         - Event3: Automatic start  
         - Event5: AutomaticStart_with_PassiveTcpEstablishment

         - Event6: AutomaticStart_with_DampPeerOscillations 
          
         - Event 7: AutomaticStart_with_DampPeerOscillations_and_ 
                                    PassiveTcpEstablishment 
    
      Automatic stop followed by automatic start (events 3, event 5, 
      event 6) can cause the peers to up and down.  Events 5 and 6 
      indicate the optional session attribute DampPeerOscillations is 
      set to true.  
     
      BGP-4 implementations today have a variety of back-off   
      mechanisms.  This document is intended to provide information on   
      these back-off mechanisms and how to record this information in a   
      MIB.  Two mechanisms are recorded in this Internet Draft:   
     
          1) Exponential back-off (section 2) and  
          2) Step-wise back-off (section 3).   
    
      The author welcomes input on additional back-off mechanisms.    
      Please send input to the author or the idr list (idr@ietf.org).  
       
      A BGP peer oscillation backoff mechanism requires additional 
      Processing in the bgp-4[1] Finite State Machine (FSM). 
      The BGP-4 draft contains an indication of where the FSM would 
      process the peer oscillation damping.  The implementation of  
      backoff mechanisms in a BGP-4 is  optional, but wide spread 
      in implementations. The exact mechanisms vary between 
      implementations.    
 
      Section 6.0 contains information on how the BGP-4 MIB encodes the   
      time between establishing BGP-4 peer sessions.  Section 7.0   
      contains the additional mechanisms needed in a BGP-4 FSM for   
      back-off implementations.   
    
    
2. Conventions used in this document  
    
      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL   
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and   
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in   
      RFC-2119 [2].  
     
      As an informational draft there are no mandatory functions.  This   
      draft hopes to recommend prudent mechanisms for back-off   
      mechanisms in BGP peers.  As in all recommendations for healthy   
      life styles the user of BGP-4 is not required to do anything,   
      except expire the BGP-4 connection according to the letter of the   
      BGP-4 standard.

3. Types of Back-off   
          
          
      The author knows of three types of back-off at this time:  
        
           - Exponential back-off, and  
           - Step-wise back-off,   
           - no back-off.  
        
      The author welcomes any comments on additional back-offs and will 
      hasten to include this information in the next revision of this 
      draft.  
          
4. Exponential back-off   
           
           
       The original description occurred in RFC 1654 and was included in 
       a version of bgp-4 [1] draft.  
        
         
       If a BGP speaker detects an error, it shuts down the connection   
       and changes its state to Idle. Getting out of the Idle state   
       requires generation of the Start event.  If such an event is   
       generated automatically, then persistent BGP errors may result in   
       persistent flapping of the speaker.  To avoid such a condition it   
       is recommended that automatic Start events should not be   
       generated immediately for a peer that was previously transitioned   
       to Idle due to an error.   
           
       For a peer that was previously transitioned to Idle due to an   
       error, the time between consecutive generation of Start events,   
       if such events are generated automatically, shall exponentially   
       increase.   The IdleHoldTimer will be the timer is utilized for   
       the count down of this feature.    The value of the initial timer   
       shall be 60 seconds. The time shall be doubled for each   
       consecutive retry.    The equation for the setting of the Idle   
       time is as follows:  
         
            Idle Hold timer = 2**(ConnectRetryCnt)*60  
         
       If the Idle Hold timer exceeds a local maximum value, the   
       connection shall be held down until a manual start event occurs.  
        
       The Idle Hold timer is initialized to zero. 
     
5. Step-wise Back-off

      The Step-wise back-off uses the following back-off function. The 
      step-wise back-off functions provide a step function based on the 
      number of retries. 
         
      An example of the Step-wise code, is as follows:   
        
        - For 1-8 retries, the amount of time between retries is 8  
          seconds.  
        
        - For 9-24 retries, the amount of time between retries, the   
          amount time between retries is 64 seconds,  
        
        - For larger than 25 retries, the amount of time between  
          retries is 128 seconds,  
        
        - Maximum number of retries is 35.  
    
    
6. Recording the Back-off information in the BGP-4 MIB [3] 
    
      The BGP-4 MIB version 2[3] will have two variables for the hold    
      time Maximums:  
        
        BGP-4 Maximum retry count value  
        BGP-4 Maximum hold time value  
         
       
      The BGP-4 MIB version 2 will have scalar flag indicating that the 
      a backoff implementation is present in a BGP peer implementation 
     
      The BGP-4 MIB version 2 will have the following table for BGP-4   
      Restart Peer Back-off:  
        
        
      BGP-4 Peer Restart Back-off table  
        
      retry cnt  hold time value (seconds)  
      --------   ---------------

      3             Value-3  
      4             Value-4  
      5             Value-5  
      6             Value-6

      For our example of the step-wise back-off, the table would be   
      filled in as  
        
      Retry cnt    hold time value  
      ---------    ---------------

7.3 Existing MIB objects used  
        
      The back-off functions are implemented as a processing within the  
      Idle state in the BGP-4 FSM. The FSM processing for the BGP-4 also  
      uses the following variables (found in BGP-4 MIB version 2).  
        
        
      1)   bgpPeerState

                       Table entry is used for the value of   
                       ConnectRetryCnt.

7.4 IdleHold substate in Idle FSM description  
        
        
      The Idle Hold has the following four substates:  
        
      IdleHoldWait  
      IdleHoldDown  
      IdleHoldTicking  
      IdleHoldNull 
        
      The definitions of these sub-states are:  
     
      sub-state1:    IdleHold-Wait   
        
        Definition: Idle Hold Down timer has expired. Local system is   
                    waiting for auto-start request on bgp peer session.  
    
        Sub-state  
        Status   
        flags:      Idle Hold Down timer is zero.  
                    Keep Idle flag is clear.  
    
       
      Substate2:    IdleHold-Down:  
                      
        Definition: Keep Idle flag is set, and Automatic start is   
                    disabled for peer session.    
        
        Sub-state  
        status  
        flags:      Keep Idle flag is set. 
    
    
      Substate3:    IdleHold-TimerTicking:  
        
        Definition: Idle Hold Timer is ticking (running)  
                    and local system will not automatically  
                    restart the BGP session.  
        
        Variable:   Idle Hold Timer is non-zero.  
        
        
      Substate4:    IdleHold-Null 
    
        Definition: No Idle Hold functions are being performed.

       Sub-state  
        status  
         flags:   KeepIdleflag is clear, 
                  IdleHoldTimer is zero 
                  IdleHold is off    
    
        
      How these sub-states are represented internally is an 
      implementation matter.  The important part is that these sub-
      states be available to the BGP MIB.  
        
    
7.5 Action upon entering the Idle state 
    
        
      Processing upon entering the Idle state:  
        
      If bgp_stop_flap flag on, the Idle Hold sub state is entered:  
        
      1)Idle Hold time = connect-retry-table[connect-retry-count]  
        
      2)Idle Hold Timer = Idle Hold time  
        
      If (Idle hold time > Idle Hold time maximum), then:  
             
           1) bgp peer sets the keep-idle-flag  
           2) set substate to Idle Hold down  
           3) clear Idle Hold timer  
              
      else  
           1) increment ConnectRetryCnt,  
           2) start Idle Hold timer with value set above  
           3) set Idle-hold substate to "Idle Timer ticking"  
        
      If bgp_stop_flag is off, this sub-state action should not occur.   
        
7.6 Substate processing   
        
        
      The events are defined from the BGP-4 draft in section 8 on  
      BGP-4 FSM [2]. This processing occurs within the IDLE state if the  
      Bgp peer oscillation back-off mechanism are used.  
    
      The form of the table is state/sub-state/action.

Security Considerations 
    
      Security concerns for BGP-4 are addressed in the BGP-4  
      specification, and accompanying specifications on TCP MD5 [4] and  
      IP Security[5].  No additional considerations need to be made for  
      the BGP-4 state machine description.
