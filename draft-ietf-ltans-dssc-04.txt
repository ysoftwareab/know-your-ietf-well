Abstract

   In many application areas it must be possible to prove the existence
   and integrity of digital signed data.  This proof depends on the
   security suitability of the cryptographic algorithms used to generate
   or verify the digital signature.  Because algorithms can become weak
   over the years, it is necessary to periodically evaluate these
   security suitabilities.  When signing or verifying data, these
   evaluations must be considered.  This document specifies a data
   structure that enables automated analysis of the security
   suitabilities of cryptographic algorithms.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation

   Digital signatures can provide data integrity and authentication.
   They are based on cryptographic algorithms, that are required to have
   certain security properties.  For example, hash algorithms must be
   resistant to collisions and in case of public key algorithms
   computation of the private key that corresponds to a given public key
   must be infeasible.  If algorithms lack the required properties,
   signatures could be forged.

   Very few algorithms satisfy the security requirements and are
   suitable for usage in signatures.  Besides, because of the increasing
   performance of computers and progresses in cryptography, algorithms
   or their parameters become insecure over the years.  The hash
   algorithm MD5, for example, is unsuitable today for many purposes.  A
   digital signature using a "weak" algorithm has no probative value.
   Many kinds of digital signed data, including signed documents, time
   stamps, certificates, and revocation lists, are affected, in
   particular in the case of long-term archiving.  Over long periods of
   time, it is assumed that the algorithms used in signatures become
   insecure.

   For this reason, it is important to periodically evaluate an
   algorithm's fitness and to consider the results of these evaluations
   when creating, verifying or renewing signatures.  One result is a
   projected validity period for the algorithm, i.e., a prediction of
   the period of time during which the algorithm is fit for use.  This
   prediction can help to detect whether an insecure algorithm is used
   in a signature or whether a signature has been properly preserved.
   Algorithm evaluations are made by expert committees.  In Germany the
   Federal Network Agency annually publishes evaluations of
   cryptographic algorithms [BNetzAg.2008].  Examples of other European
   and international evaluations are [NIST.800-57-Part1.2006] and
   [ETSI-TS102176-1-2005].

   These evaluations are published in documents intended to be read by
   humans.  Therefore it is necessary to define a data structure that
   expresses the content of the evaluations to enable automated
   processing.  This standardized data structure can be used for
   publication and can be interpreted by signature generation and
   verification tools.  Algorithm evaluations are pooled in a security
   suitability policy.  In this document a data structure for a security
   suitability policy is specified.  This document does not attempt to
   catalog the security properties of cryptographic algorithms.

1.2.  Terminology

   Algorithm:  A cryptographic algorithm, i.e. a public key or hash
      algorithm.  For public key algorithms, this is the algorithm with
      its parameters, if any.

   Operator:  Instance which uses and interprets a policy, e.g. a
      signature verification component.

   Policy:  An abbreviation for security suitability policy.

   Publisher:  Instance that publishes the policy containing the
      evaluation of algorithms.

   Security suitability policy:  The evaluation of cryptographic
      algorithms with regard to their security in a specific application
      area, e.g. signing or verifying data.  The evaluation is published
      in an electronic format.

   Suitable algorithm:  An algorithm which is evaluated against a policy
      and determined to be valid for a particular time.

1.3.  Use Cases

   In the following some use cases for a security suitability policy are
   presented.

   Long-term archiving:  The most important use case is long-term
      archiving of signed data.  Algorithms or their parameters become
      insecure over long time periods.  Therefore signatures of archived
      data and timestamps have to be periodically renewed.  A policy
      provides information about suitable and threatened algorithms.
      Additionally the policy assists in verifying archived as well as
      re-signed documents.

   Services:  Services may provide information about cryptographic
      algorithms.  On the basis of a policy a service is able to provide
      the date when an algorithm became insecure or presumably will
      become insecure or to provide all algorithms which are presently
      valid.  Verification tools or long-term archiving systems can
      request such services and therefore do not need to deal with the
      algorithm security by themselves.
      Long-term Archive Services (LTA) as defined in [RFC4810] may use
      the policy for signature renewal.

Internet-Draft                    DSSC                      October 2008


   Signing and verifying:  When signing documents, certificates or
      attestations, e.g. within an LTAP transaction
      [I-D.ietf-ltans-ltap], it must be assured that the algorithms used
      for signing or verifying are suitable.  Accordingly, when
      verifying CMS [RFC3852] or XML signatures [RFC3275]
      [ETSI-TS101903], not only the validity of the certificates may be
      checked but also the validity of the algorithms.

   Re-encryption:  A security suitability policy can also be used to
      decide if encrypted documents must be re-encrypted because the
      encryption algorithm is no longer secure.

2.  Requirements and Assumptions

   Section 2.1 describes general requirements for a data structure
   containing the security suitabilities of algorithms.  In Section 2.2
   assumptions are specified concerning both the design and the usage of
   the data structure.

   A policy contains a list of algorithms that have been evaluated by a
   publisher.  An algorithm evaluation is described by its identifier,
   security constraints and validity period.  By these constraints the
   requirements for algorithm properties must be defined, e.g. a public
   key algorithm is evaluated on the basis of its parameters.

2.1.  Requirements

   Automatic interpretation:  The data structure of the policy must
      allow automated evaluation of the security suitabilities of an
      algorithm.

   Flexibility:  The data structure must be flexible enough to support
      new algorithms.  Future policy publications may include
      evaluations of algorithms that are currently unknown.  It must be
      possible to add new algorithms with the corresponding security
      constraints in the data structure.  Additionally, the data
      structure must be independent of the intended use, e.g.,
      encryption, signing, verifying, and signature renewing.

   Source authentication:  Policies may be published by different
      institutions, e.g. on national or EU level, whereas one policy
      needs not to be in agreement with the other one.  Furthermore
      organizations may undertake their own evaluations for internal
      purposes.  For this reason a policy must be attributable to its
      publisher.

   Integrity and authenticity:  The integrity and authenticity of a
      published security suitability policy must be assured.

2.2.  Assumptions

   It is assumed that a policy contains the evaluations of all currently
   known algorithms, including the expired ones.

   An algorithm is valid if it is contained in the current policy and
   the time of interest is within the validity period.  Additionally, if
   the algorithm has any parameters, these parameters must meet the
   requirements defined in the security constraints.

   If an algorithm appears in a policy for the first time, it may be

   assumed that the algorithm has already been suitable in the past.
   Generally, algorithms are used in practice prior to evaluation.

   To avoid inconsistencies, multiple instances of the same algorithm
   are prohibited.  The publisher must take care about preventing
   conflicts within a policy.

   Assertions made in the policy are suitable at least until the next
   policy is published.

   Publishers may extend the lifetime of an algorithm prior to reaching
   the end of the algorithm's validity period by publishing a revised
   policy.  Publishers should not resurrect algorithms that are expired
   at the time a revised policy is published.

3.  Data Structures

   This section describes the syntax of a security suitability policy
   defined as an XML schema.  ASN.1 modules are defined in Appendix C
   and Appendix D.  The schema uses the following namespace:

      http://www.sit.fraunhofer.de/dssc

   Within this document, the prefix "dssc" is used for this namespace.
   The schema starts with the following schema definition:


   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"

              schemaLocation="xmldsig-core-schema.xsd"/>


3.1.  SecuritySuitabilityPolicy

   The SecuritySuitabilityPolicy element is the root element of a
   policy.  It has an optional id attribute which must be used as a
   reference when signing the policy (Section 3.14).  The element is
   defined by the following schema:


   <xs:element name="SecuritySuitabilityPolicy"
               type="dssc:SecuritySuitabilityPolicyType"/>
   <xs:complexType name="SecuritySuitabilityPolicyType">

3.2.  PolicyName

   The PolicyName element consists of an arbitrary name of the policy
   and an optional Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).


   <xs:element name="PolicyName" type="dssc:PolicyNameType"/>
   <xs:complexType name="PolicyNameType">
     <xs:sequence>

   The Publisher element contains information about the publisher of the
   policy.  It is composed of the name, e.g. name of institution, an
   optional address, and an optional URI.


   <xs:element name="Publisher" type="dssc:PublisherType"/>
   <xs:complexType name="PublisherType">

   </xs:sequence>
 </xs:complexType>


3.5.  PolicyIssueDate

   The PolicyIssueDate element indicates the point of time when the
   policy was issued.

3.6.  NextUpdate

   The optional NextUpdate element may be used to indicate when the next
   policy will be issued.

3.7.  Usage

   The optional Usage element determines the intended use of the policy
   (e.g. certificate validation, signing and verifying documents).

3.8.  Algorithm

   A security suitability policy must contain at least one Algorithm
   element.  An algorithm is identified by an AlgorithmIdentifier
   element.  Additionally the Algorithm element contains all evaluations
   of the specific cryptographic algorithm.  More than one evaluation
   may be necessary if the evaluation depends on the parameter
   constraints.  The Algorithm element is defined by the following
   schema:


   <xs:element name="Algorithm" type="dssc:AlgorithmType"/>
   <xs:complexType name="AlgorithmType">
     <xs:sequence>
       <xs:element ref="dssc:AlgorithmIdentifier"/>

3.9.  AlgorithmIdentifier

   The AlgorithmIdentifier element is used to identify a cryptographic
   algorithm.  It consists of the algorithm name, at least one object
   identifer, and optional URIs.  The element is defined as follows:


   <xs:element name="AlgorithmIdentifier"
               type="dssc:AlgorithmIdentifierType"/>
   <xs:complexType name="AlgorithmIdentifierType">
     <xs:sequence>
       <xs:element ref="dssc:Name"/>
       <xs:element name="ObjectIdentifier" type="xs:string"
                   maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
       <xs:element ref="dssc:URI" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
     </xs:sequence>
   </xs:complexType>


3.10.  Evaluation

   The evaluation element contains the evaluation of one cryptographic
   algorithm in dependence of its parameter contraints.  E.g. the
   suitability of the RSA algorithm depends on the modulus length (RSA
   with a modulus length of 1024 may have another suitability period as
   RSA with a modulus length of 2048).  Current hash algorithms like
   SHA-1 or RIPEMD-160 do not have any parameters.  Therefore the
   Parameter element is optional.  The suitability of the algorithm is
   expressed by a validity period which is defined by the Validity
   element.

3.11.  Parameter

   The Parameter element is used to express constraints on algorithm
   specific parameters like the "moduluslength" parameter in case of
   RSA.

   The Parameter element has a name attribute which holds the name of
   the parameter (e.g. "moduluslength" for RSA [RFC3447]).  Besides a
   better readability of the policy, the attribute may be used by
   implementations for output messages.  In Section 4 the parameter
   names of currently known signature algorithms are defined.  For the
   actual parameter, an exact value or a range of values may be defined.
   These constraints are expressed by the following elements:

   Exact:  The Exact element specifies the exact value of the parameter.

   Min:  The Min element defines the minimum value of the parameter.
      That means, also all other values greater than the given one meet
      the requirements.

   Max:  The Max element defines the maximum value the parameter may
      take.

   Range:  The Range element is used to define a range of values,
      consisting of a minimum and a maximum value.  The parameter may
      have any value within the defined range, including the minimum and
      maximum values.

   For one algorithm it is recommended not to mix these elements in
   order to avoid inconsistencies.

   These constraints are sufficient for all current algorithms.  If
   future algorithms will need constraints which cannot be expressed by
   the elements above, an arbitrary XML structure may be inserted which
   meets the new constraints.  For this reason, the Parameter element
   contains an "any" element.  The schema for the Parameter element is
   as follows:

3.12.  Validity

   The Validity element is used to define the period of the (predicted)
   suitability of the algorithm.  It is composed of an optional start
   date and an optional end date.  Defining no end date means the
   algorithm has an open-end validity.  Of course this may be restricted
   by a future policy which sets an end date for the algorithm.  If the
   end of the validity period is in the past, the algorithm is not
   suitable.  The element is defined by the following schema:


   <xs:element name="Validity" type="dssc:ValidityType"/>
   <xs:complexType name="ValidityType">
     <xs:sequence>
       <xs:element name="Start" type="xs:date" minOccurs="0"/>

     </xs:sequence>
   </xs:complexType>


3.13.  Information

   The Information element may be used to give additional textual
   information about the algorithm or the evaluation, e.g. references on
   algorithm specifications.  The element is defined as follows:

       </xs:element>
     </xs:sequence>
   </xs:complexType>


3.14.  Signature

   The optional Signature element may be used to guarantee the integrity
   and authenticity of the policy.  It is an XML signature specified in
   [RFC3275].  The signature must relate to the
   SecuritySuitabilityPolicy element.  If the Signature element is set,
   the SecuritySuitabilityPolicy element must have the optional id
   attribute.  This attribute must be used to reference the
   SecuritySuitabilityPolicy element within the Signature element.
   Since it is an enveloped signature, the signature must use the
   transformation algorithm identified by the following URI:

      http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#enveloped-signature

4.  Definition of Parameters

   This section defines the parameter names for the currently known
   public key algorithms.  The signature algorithms RSA [RFC3447] and
   DSA [FIPS.186-1.1998] are always used in conjunction with a one-way
   hash algorithm.  RSA with RIPEMD-160 is such a combined algorithm
   with its own object identifier.  RSA and DSA may be combined with the
   suitable hash algorithms SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512,
   and RIPEMD-160.  The following parameters refer to the appropriate
   combined algorithms as well.

      The parameter of RSA should be named "moduluslength".

      The parameters for DSA should be "plength" and "qlength".

   Publishers of policies must use the same parameter names, so that the
   correct interpretation is guaranteed.

5.  Processing

   Evaluation of the security suitabilities of an algorithm is described
   in three parts: verification of the policy, determination of
   algorithm validity at time of interest, and evaluation of algorithm
   parameters, if any.

   In the following, a process is described that can be used to
   determine if an algorithm was valid at a particular point of time.

5.1.  Inputs

   To determine the security suitability of an algorithm, the following
   information is required:

   o  Policy

   o  Current time

   o  Algorithm identifier and parameter constraints (if associated)

   o  Time of interest

5.2.  Verify policy

   The signature on the policy should be verified and a certification
   path from the policy signer's certificate to a current trust anchor
   should be constructed and validated [RFC5280].  The algorithms used
   to verify the digital signature and validate the certification path
   MUST be valid per the contents of the policy being verified.  If
   signature verification fails, certification path validation fails or
   an unsuitable algorithm is required to perform these checks, then the
   policy MUST be rejected.

   The nextUpdate time in the policy MUST be greater than the current
   time or absent.  If the nextUpdate time is less than the current
   time, the policy MUST be rejected.

5.3.  Algorithm evaluation

   To determine if an algorithm is valid relative to the time of
   interest, locate the Algorithm element in the policy that corresponds
   to the algorithm identifier provided as input.  The Algorithm element
   is located by comparing the object identifier in the element to the
   object identifier included in the algorithm identifier provided as
   input.

   If no matching Algorithm element is found, then the algorithm is not

Internet-Draft                    DSSC                      October 2008


   valid according the policy.

   If an Algorithm element is found, the validity of each Evaluation
   element must be checked.  For each Evaluation element,

   o  Confirm the Start time is less than the time of interest or
      absent.  Discard the entry if the Start time is present and
      greater than the time of interest.

   o  Confirm the End time is greater than the time of interest or
      absent.  Discard the entry if the End time is present and less
      than the time of interest.

   If all Evaluation elements were rejected, the algorithm is not valid
   according the policy.

   Any entries not rejected will be used for the evaluation of the
   parameters, if any.

5.4.  Evaluation of parameters

   After confirming an algorithm is valid relative to the time of
   interest, any necessary parameters must be evaluated within the
   context of the type and usage of the algorithm.  Details of parameter
   evaluation are defined on a per algorithm basis.

   To evaluate the parameters, the Parameter elements of each Evaluation
   element that has not been rejected in the process described in
   Section 5.3 must be checked.  For each Parameter element,

   o  Confirm that the parameter was provided as input.  Discard the
      Evaluation element if the parameter does not match to any of the
      parameters provided as input.

   o  If the Parameter element has an Exact element, confirm that the
      parameter value exactly complies with the according parameter
      provided as input.  Discard the Evaluation element if the
      parameter value does not comply.

   o  If the Parameter element has a Min element, confirm that the
      parameter value is less than or equal to the according parameter
      provided as input.  Discard the Evaluation element if the
      parameter value does not meet the constraint.

   o  If the Parameter element has a Max element, confirm that the
      parameter value is greater than or equal to the according
      parameter provided as input.  Discard the Evaluation element if
      the parameter value does not meet the constraint.

Internet-Draft                    DSSC                      October 2008


   o  If the Parameter element has a Range element, confirm that the
      value of the according parameter provided as input is within the
      range.  Discard the Evaluation element if the parameter value does
      not meet the constraint.

   o  If the Parameter has another constraint, confirm that the value of
      the according parameter provided as input meets this constraint.
      If it does not or if the constraint is unrecognized, discard the
      Evaluation element.

   If all Evaluation elements were rejected, the algorithm is not valid
   according the policy.

   Any entries not rejected will be provided as output.

5.5.  Output

   If the algorithm is not valid, return an error.

   If the algorithm is valid, return the Evaluation elements that were
   not discarded.

6.  Security Considerations

   The policy for security suitabilities has great impact on the quality
   of the results of signature generation and verification operations.
   If an algorithm is incorrectly evaluated against a policy, signatures
   with a low probative force could be created or verification results
   could be incorrect.  The following security considerations have been
   identified:

   1.  Publishers must ensure unauthorized manipulation of security
       suitabilities is not possible prior to a policy is signed and
       published.  There is no mechanism provided to revoke a policy
       after publication.  Since the algorithm evaluations change
       infrequently, the lifespan of a policy should be carefully
       considered prior to publication.

   2.  Operators should only accept policies issued by a trusted
       publisher.  It must not be possible to alter or replace security
       suitabilities once accepted by the client.

   3.  Operators should periodically check to see if a new policy has
       been published to avoid using obsolete policy information.  For
       publishers it is suggested not to omit the NextUpdate element in
       order to give operators a hint, when the next policy will be
       published.

   4.  When signing a policy, algorithms should be used which are
       suitable according this policy.

Appendix A.  DSSC and ERS

A.1.  Verification of Evidence Records using DSSC

   This section describes the verification of an Evidence Record
   according to the Evidence Record Syntax (ERS, [RFC4998]) by using the
   presented data structure.

   An Evidence Record contains a sequence of archiveTimeStampChains
   which consist of ArchiveTimeStamps.  For each archiveTimeStamp the
   hash algorithm used for the hash tree (digestAlgorithm) and the
   public key algorithm and hash algorithm in the timestamp signature
   have to be examined.  The relevant date is the time information in
   the timestamp (date of issue).  Starting with the first
   ArchiveTimestamp it has to be assured that

   1.  The timestamp uses public key and hash algorithms which have been
       suitable at the date of issue.

   2.  The hashtree was build with an hash algorithm that has been
       suitable at the date of issue as well.

   3.  Algorithms for timestamp and hashtree in the preceding
       ArchiveTimestamp must have been suitable at the issuing date of
       considered ArchiveTimestamp.

   4.  Algorithms in the last ArchiveTimstamp have to be suitable now.

   If the check of one of these items fails, this will lead to a failure
   of the verification.

A.2.  Storing DSSC Policies in Evidence Records

   ERS provides the field cryptoInfos for the storage of additional
   verification data.  For the integration of a security suitability
   policy in an Evidence Record the following content types are defined
   for both ASN.1 and XML representation:


   DSSC_ASN1 {iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6)
           internet(1) security(5) mechanisms(5)
           ltans(11) id-ct(1) id-ct-dssc-asn1(2) }


   DSSC_XML {iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6)
           internet(1) security(5) mechanisms(5)
           ltans(11) id-ct(1) id-ct-dssc-xml(3) }

Appendix E.  Example

   In the following an example of a policy is presented.  It is
   generated on the basis of the last evaluation of the German Federal
   Network Agency ([BNetzAg.2008]).  The policy consists on hash
   algorithms as well as public key algorithms.  RSA with modulus length
   of 768 is an example for an expired algorithm.

   Combined algorithms should also be part of the policy since some
   programs know the object identifiers of combined algorithms instead
   of the general public key algorithm.  The following excerpt describes
   a combined algorithm.  The validity end date is given by the end
   dates of RSA and RIPEMD-160, in particular it is the former one.
   Combined algorithms could replace the public key algorithms in the
   policy example.  They could also be listed together with public key
   algorithms.

       <Name>RIPEMD-160 with RSA 2048</Name>
