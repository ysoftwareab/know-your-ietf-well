2  Introduction 
   
  This document describes a model for managing pseudo wire services 
  for transmission over a packet Switched Network (PSN). This MIB 
  module is generic and common to all types of PSN and PW services. 
  This document is closely related to [FRMWK], describing the 
  transport and encapsulation of L1 and L2 services over any type of 
  PSN and MPLS respectively, creating a Pseudo Wire (PW) service. 
  This document describes the MIB objects that define the generic 
  pseudo wire association to the PSN and pseudo wire configurations 
  that are not specific to the carried service. A PW type field will 
  be used to point to the relevant service MIB tables, described in 
  other documents, and a similar PSN type field will point to PSN 
  specific module, for example [PWMPLSMIB].

3  Terminology 
   
  This document uses terminology from the document describing the PW 
  framework [FRMWK]. 
   
4  The SNMP Management Framework  
    
  The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major 
  components: 
   
  o An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571]. 
   
  o Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the 
  purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of 
  Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 
  16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 1215 
  [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 
  58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 
  2580 [RFC2580]. 
   
  o Message protocols for transferring management information.  The 
  first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and 
  described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of the 
  SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track 
  protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901] and 
  RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the message protocol is 
  called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906], RFC 2572 
  [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574]. 
   
  o Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The 
  first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is 
  described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of protocol 
  operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 
  [RFC1905]. 
  o A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [RFC2573] 
  and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 
  [RFC2575]. 
   
  A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management 
  Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570]. 
  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, 
  termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB 
  are defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI. 
  This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A 
  MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate 
  translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically 
  equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no 
  translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable 
  information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in 
  SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of

                            Information Base 


  machine readable information is not considered to change the 
  semantics of the MIB. 
   
4.1  Object Definitions  
   
  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, 
  termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB 
  are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One 
  (ASN.1) defined in the SMI. In particular, an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an 
  administratively assigned name, names each object type. The object 
  type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a 
  specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we 
  often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to also refer to 
  the object type.  
   
5  Feature Checklist 
   
  The PW MIB (PW-MIB) is designed to satisfy the following 
  requirements and constraints: 
   
   - The MIB is designed to be extensible to all types of PSNs. PSNs  
     specific MIBs will be defined in additional documents. 
   
   - The MIB enables the use of any emulated service. Emulated 
     service specific MIBs will be defined in additional documents.  

   - The MIB supports manually configured VCs. 
   
   - The MIB supports the VC ID and Group ID. 
   
   - The MIB supports point-to-point PW connections. Point-to- 
     multipoint connections are for future study.  
   
   - The MIB enables both strict and loose incoming VC lookup. In  
     strict mode, only VC carried inside known in advance tunnels are  
     accepted in path oriented PSNs. In not-path oriented PSNs, the  
     source address of the received packet must be checked in strict  
     mode. 
   
6  PW-MIB usage 
   
  The MIB structure for defining a PW service is composed from three 
  types of modules. 
   
  The first type is the PW-MIB module, which configures general 
  parameters of the VC that are common to all types of emulated 
  services and PSNs. 
   
  The second type of module is per PSN module. There is a different 
  module for each type of PSN. These modules associate the VC with 
  one or more "tunnels" that carry the service over the PSN. These

                            Information Base 


  modules are defined in other documents; see for example 
  [PWMPLSMIB]. 
   
  The third type of module is service-specific module, which is 
  emulated signal type dependent. These modules are defined in other 
  documents; see for example [CEPMIB]. 
   
  [PWTC] defines some of the object types used in these modules. 
   
6.1  PW-MIB usage 
   
    - The VC table (pwVcTable) is used for all VC types (ATM, FR, 
    Ethernet, SONET, etc.). This table contains high level generic 
    parameters related to the VC creation. A row is created by the 
    operator for each PW service. 
     
    - Based on the PSN type defined for the VC, rows are created in 
    PSN specific module (for example [PWMPLSMIB]) and associated to 
    the VC table by the common VC index. 
     
    - Based on the VC type defined for the VC, rows are created in 
    service-specific module (for example [CEPMIB]) and associated to 
    the VC table by the common VC index. 
     
    - The MIB includes performance parameters collection common to all 
    types of PW. 
     
    - Reverse mapping tables allow an EMS to quickly order VCs based 
    on their type and VC ID or based on the peer nodes addresses. 
     
6.2  Relations to the ifTable 
   
  The PW VC itself is in general not an ifIndex as it's own, however 
  in many cases the VC is associated via the MIB tables to an ifIndex 
  the VC is emulating. This ifIndex may represent a physical entity - 
  for example a PW emulating a SONET path as in CEP: The VC itself is 
  not an ifIndex, however the MIB associate the VC to the ifIndex of 
  the path to be emulated. In some cases, the VC will be associated 
  to an ifIndex representing a virtual interface.  An example is VPLS 
  service where the PW emulates a logical interface of a (logical) 
  bridge. The physical ports association to the VPLS service instance 
  is defined in non-PW MIBs in this case. 
   
  Exception to the above may exist in some services, where it is 
  convenient to use the VC as an ifIndex in the ifTable. These cases 
  are discussed in the service specific MIBs. 
   
  Note that the ifIndex that carry the VC toward the PSN is in 
  general not explicitly configured via PW MIB modules except in rare 
  cases. In most cases the VC is carried inside a PSN tunnel, and the

  interfaces carrying the tunnel are specified in the related MIBs 
  that control the PSN tunnels. 
     
6.3  Example of MIB usage 
   
  In this section we provide an example of using the MIB objects 
  described in section 8 to set up a CEP VC over MPLS PSN. While this 
  example is not meant to illustrate every permutation of the MIB, it 
  is intended as an aid to understanding some of the key concepts. It 
  is meant to be read after going through the MIB itself. 
  In this example a PW service for CEP is configured over an MPLS PSN 
  (MPLS-TE tunnel). It uses LDP as in [TRANS] for service set-up.

  In pwVcTable:

  The agent now creates a row in pwVcMplsTable [PWMPLS] based on the 
  VcIndex, that is configured with MPLS specific values: 
   
  In pwVcMplsTable: 
  { 
        pwVcMplsMplsType        mplsTe, 
        pwVcMplsExpBitsMode     outerTunnel, 
        pwVcMplsExpBits         0, -- Not applicable 
        pwVcMplsTtl             2, 
        ... 
  } 
   
  The operator now associates the VC with an outgoing TE tunnel: 
  In pwVcMplsOutboundTable: 
   
  { 
        pwVcMplsOutboundIndex                    0, -- The first row 
                                                 -- for this VcIndex 
        pwVcMplsOutBoundLsrXcIndex               0, -- MPLS-TE  
        pwVcMplsOutboundTunnelIndex              500, 
        pwVcMplsOutboundTunnelInstance           0, 
        pwVcMplsOutboundTunnelLclLSR             1.2.3.4, -- Always  
                                  -- the LSR ID of the current node. 
        pwVcMplsOutboundTunnelPeerLSR            1.4.3.2 
        pwVcMplsOutboundIfIndex                  0, -- MPLS-TE 
   
        .. 
  } 
   
  pwVcMplsInboundTable is not used because loose LDP set-up is used. 
   
  A row in pwVcIdMappingTable and in pwVcPeerMappingTable will be 
  created by the agent and will enable easy lookup for the VcIndex 
  from knowledge of the VC type/VC ID or peer IP address 
  respectively. 
   
  A row in pwVcMplsTeMappingTable will be created by the agent and 
  will enable easy lookup for the VcIndex from knowledge of the outer 
  tunnel.

     DESCRIPTION 
         "This MIB contains managed object definitions for Pseudo 
          Wire operation as in: Pate, P., et al, <draft-ietf-pwe3- 
          framework>, Xiao, X., et al, <draft-ietf-pwe3- 
          requirements>, Martini, L., et al, <draft-martini- 
          l2circuit-trans-mpls>, and Martini, L., et al, 
          <draft-martini-l2circuit-encap-mpls>. 
   
          The indexes for this MIB are also used to index the PSN- 
          specific tables and the VC-specific tables. The VC Type 
          dictates which VC-specific MIB to use. For example, a  
          'cep' VC Type requires the use the configuration and status  
          tables within the CEP-MIB. 
   
          This MIB enable the use of any underlying packet switched  
          network (PSN). Specific tables for the MPLS PSN is 
          currently defined in a separate PW-MPLS-MIB. Tables to 
          support other PSNs (IP, L2TP for example) will be added to 
          this MIB in future revisions. 
           
          At the time of publication of this version, there are no  
          PWE3 WG documents for all features and objects in this MIB, 
          and the MIB is therefore subject to change based on the WG  
          progress."

8  Security Considerations 
   
  There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that 
  have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such 
  objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
  environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
  environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
  network operations. 
   
  SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network 
  itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is 
  no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and 
  GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB. 
   
  It is recommended that the implementers consider the security 
  features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the 
  use of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the 
  View-based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended. 
   
  It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP 
  entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly 
  configured to give access to the objects only to those principals 
  (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET 
  (change/create/delete) them.
