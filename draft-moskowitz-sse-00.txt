Abstract

   This memo specifies the details of the Session Security Envelope
   (SSE).  SSE is a session protocol aiming to guarantee
   confidentiality, integrity and authentication completely
   independently by the underlying context, namely network and transport
   layers.  A single session using the SEE protocol can include a single
   transport session or multiple transport sessions.  This mean that SSE
   can survive the break-down in network and transport layers or to
   attacks carried against them.  SSE is also applicable in networks
   lacking in classic inter-networking and transport protocols SSE
   relies on modern AEAD block cipher modes of operations, a class of
   block cipher modes which allows, at the same time, to authenticate
   the message while encrypting a part of it.

1.  Introduction

   This memo specifies the details of the Session Security Envelope
   (SSE).  SSE is a session protocol aiming to guarantee
   confidentiality, integrity and authentication completely
   independently by the underlying context, namely network and transport
   layers.  A single SSE session can span a single transport session or

   multiple transport sessions.  These transport sessions can use the
   same transport layer protocol (E.g.  TCP) or use different transport
   protocols.  SSE can survive the break-down in network and transport
   layers or to attacks carried against them.  Moreover SSE will relies
   on modern AEAD block cipher modes of operations, a class of block
   cipher modes which allows, at the same time, to authenticate the
   message while encrypting a part of it.

3.  SSL Security Boundary

   The security boundary comes at layer above the IP transport layers
   (TCP, STCP, DTLS).  This security allows the data to be secure prior
   to entering into a specific transport layer.  A single SSE session
   can span 1 or N transport protocol connections.  The multiple
   transport connections running under an SSE session may all use one
   protocol (e.g.  TCP) or multiple protocols (e.g.  TCP, STCP, DTLS).
   The higher layer security boundary provides a common security layer.

4.  API

   The initial API is part of a shim with socket call over a TCP socket.

   s = int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol)

   where:

      domain: AF_INET and AF_INET6 supported

      type: SOCK_SECURE

5.  Packet format

   An SSE PDU is a Session Layer PDU (SPDU).  In order to accommodate
   various use cases three formats are available for the PDU.  The only
   difference between those formats is the size of length and sequence
   number fields.  Following these fields is the encrypted payload and
   Integrity Check Value (ICV).  Encrypted payload and ICV has a
   substructure depending on the choice of encryption algorithm and
   mode.

5.1.  SSE compact format

   SSE compact format aims to provide a Session Security Layer to
   applications leveraging on constrained network media with packet size
   limitations or high cost per bit transport.

   In the SSE compact format:

   SPI is 32 bits.

   Length is 12 bits

   Sequence Number is 20 bits

   12 bits of Length allows (2^12) 4096 bytes in the Encrypted Payload
   (does not include the ICV). 20 bits in the Sequence Number allows to
   send (2^20) 1048576 packets before renegotiating the key.  (The ICV
   length is set by the KMP parameters, so the length is known and
   therefore is not included in the length calculation)

   32 bits of Length allows (2^32)or ~4Gbytes in the Encrypted Payload
   (does not include the ICV). 32 bits in the Sequence Number allows to

5.4.  Header Fields

   SPI is the Security Parameter Index, a 32 bit number received from
   the external KMP.  It is the index into the Security Association and
   is typically unidirectional.  That is each direction in has its own
   SPI.  A KMP for a unicast communication would provide the two SPIs.
   Multicast is different.  Depending on the requirements, there can be
   one SPI for all transmitters or one per transmitter.

   Length is the length in bytes of the encrypted payload.  This does
   not include the ICV.  The length of the ICV depends on the block
   cipher settings.

   Sequence Number is a, strictly increasing by 1, counter.  When the
   field cannot be increased without wrapping a key renegotiation MUST
   be performed.  Please note that this Sequence Number has not the same
   meaning and implications of a Transport Layer sequence number, hence
   increasing by 1 is a good idea.

   Note: It is common practice to rekey some time BEFORE the number
   space is exhausted.

5.5.  AEAD integration

   SSE MUST use AEAD block cipher modes.  AEAD block cypher modes will
   ensure confidentiality on the payload and integrity of both the
   payload and the headers (SPI, length and sequence number).

6.  Packet processing and State Machine

   SSE will spawn across several ports and protocols, hence each
   listened port and protocol can be a different SSE instance.  See
   Architecture Draft.

6.1.  Establishing a session

   An application can establish a session via the SSE API, which in turn
   will interact with a KMP daemon.  SSE instance will get all
   parameters related to the session from the KMP daemon.

   Editorial note: Is this a local vulnerability?

6.2.  Processing Outgoing Application Data

   After having established an SSE session, an application can send
   application- level data using the normal socket calls.  The SSE layer
   will encapsulate the packet, and send it on the appropriate transport
   session.  The application doesn't need to know SPI, sequence number
   or key.  The local SSE knows these facts, and keeps it within the SSE
   data associated with a set of transport connections.

6.3.  Processing Incoming Application Data

   After having established an SSE session, the packets will be sent to
   the transport layer for de-encapsulation.  After header removal, the
   socket processing will hand it to the SEE processing for security
   check.  If the packet is deemed secure, the socket will remove the
   SSE envelope.  The application see the byte stream as data from a
   transport connection.

   The application doesn't need to know SPI, sequence number or key,
   relying on a fake connection. (but its local SSE instance knows it,
   hence the application own memory where those are stored)

7.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.

8.  Security Considerations

   As SSE uses an AEAD block cipher, it is vulnerable to attack if a
   sequence number is reused for a given key.  Thus implementations of
   SSE MUST provide for rekeying prior to Sequence Number rollover.  An
   implementation should never assume that for a given context, the
   sequence number space will never be exhausted.  Key Management
   Protocols like IKEv2 [RFC 4306] or HIP [RFC 7401] could be used to

Internet-Draft          Session Security Envelope             March 2015


   provide for rekeying management.  The KMP SHOULD not create a network
   layer fate-sharing limitation.

   As any security protocol can be used for a resource exhaustion
   attack, implementations should consider methods to mitigate flooding
   attacks of messages with valid SPIs but invalid content.  Even with
   the ICV check, resources are still consumed to validate the ICV.

   SSE makes no attempt to recommend the ICV length.  For constrained
   network implementations, other sources should guide the
   implementation as to ICV length selection.  The ICV length selection
   SHOULD be the the responsibility of the KMP.

   As with any layered security protocol, SSE makes no claims of
   protecting lower or higher processes in the communication stack.
   Each layer's risks and liabilities need be addressed at that level.
