  Introduction  
    
   This document provides a survey of BGP-4 v1 MIB implementations.  
   After a brief summary, each response is listed.  The authors make no 
   claim as to the accuracy of the information provided. 
    
   The following organizations reported having BGP-4 MIB 
   implementations:  Cisco Systems, Redback Networks, and NextHop 
   Technologies.

  Survey Summary 
 
   This survey asked for information about the implementations of the 
   BGP-4 [BGP4] that support the BGP-4 v1 MIB [BGP4-V1-MIB]. 
    
   Two or more of the implementations of BGP-4 v1 MIB [BGP-V1-MIB] each 
   implement all the objects. None of the implementation that responded 
   to the survey implemented the read-write variables (section 2.2).  
   The two TRAPs as specified are not implemented by two implementations 
   (section 2.3).  The counters initialized state is zeroed in all 
   implementation, but a reset peer is only reset by the Redback 
   implementation (section 2.4).

                   BGP-4 MIB Implementation Survey       October 2004 
       
 
   There are 3 agent implementations for the 3 surveyed (section 2.5). 
   The SNMP managers used to test the implementations are: netsnmp 
   (www.netsnmp.org), mrtg (www.mrtg.org), and internal Cisco manager. 
    
    
   No inter-operability issues related to the Manager specification were 
   found.

    MIB Agent BGP Peer Reset state 
    
      Two questions were asked about the the bgpPeerInUpdates, 
      bgpPeerOutUpdates, bgpPeerInTotalMessages and 
      bgpPeerOutTotalMessages.   
       
      The first was "do you initialize these counters zero", and the 
      second was "Do you reset these counters to zero when a configured 
      peer enters established state". 
      
       Cisco  NextHop  Redback 
        Y      Y        Y        initialize to zero 
        N      N        Y        reset to zero when configured peer

   Agent Implementation Checklist 
    
       This section should be completed by individuals or companies who 
       have implemented RFC 1657 support in an SNMP agent. 
    
       Is your BGP4 MIB agent an independent implementation?  Or is it 
       based on public domain or commercial code?  If it is not 
       independent, what code base was used? 
        
       - Cisco's BGP4 MIB agent is implemented on commercial Cisco IOS. 
    
       Have you done any interoperability testing with managers that 
       implement the BGP4 MIB?  If so, which manager implementations 
       have been used with your agent? 
    
       - (this portion was not returned by Cisco)  
    
       For each manager with which you have interoperated, which of the 
       following features were tested? Duplicate this section for each 
       manager, and indicate yes or no (Y/N) for each feature: 
    
       - (this portion was not returned by Cisco) 
    
       Manager Implementation Used: <Name> 
       Original Manager Code Base (if known):  <Name> 
       (Y/N) Manager implemented independently from your agent? 
       (Y/N) Read access to BGP4 MIB variables. 
       (Y/N) Write access to BGP4 MIB variables. 
       (Y/N) Sending and receiving BGP4 MIB notifications. 
       (Y/N) Tested using SNMPv1/v2c. 
       (Y/N) Tested using SNMPv3. 
    
    
       Are there any unresolved interoperability issues between your 
       BGP4 MIB agent and any BGP4 MIB manager that may indicate  
       problems in the specification?  If so, please provide technical 
       details.

   Agent Implementation Checklist 
    
       This section should be completed by individuals or companies who 
       have implemented RFC 1657 support in an SNMP agent. 
    
       Is your BGP4 MIB agent an independent implementation?  Or is it 
       based on public domain or commercial code?  If it is not 
       independent, what code base was used?

       - Independent implementation. 
    
       Have you done any interoperability testing with managers that 
       implement the BGP4 MIB?  If so, which manager implementations 
       have been used with your agent? 
    
       - Yes. 
    
       For each manager with which you have interoperated, which of the 
       following features were tested? Duplicate this section for each 
       manager, and indicate yes or no (Y/N) for each feature:

       problems in the specification?  If so, please provide technical 
       details. 
    
       (Y/N)        Does your agent support SNMPv3?
