                     Multiple Language Content Type
                  draft-ietf-slim-multilangcontent-14

Abstract

   This document defines the multipart/multilingual content type, which
   is an addition to the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)
   standard to make it possible to send one message that contains
   multiple language versions of the same information.  The translations
   would be identified by a language tag and selected by the email
   client based on a user's language settings.

1.  Introduction

   Since the invention of email and the rapid spread of the Internet,
   more and more people have been able to communicate in more and more
   countries and in more and more languages.  But during this time of
   technological evolution, email has remained a single-language
   communication tool, whether it is English to English, Spanish to
   Spanish or Japanese to Japanese.

   Also during this time, many corporations have established their
   offices in multi-cultural cities and formed departments and teams
   that span continents, cultures and languages, so the need to
   communicate efficiently with little margin for miscommunication has
   grown significantly.

Internet-Draft       Multiple Language Content Type          August 2017


   This document defines the multipart/multilingual content type, which
   is an addition to the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)
   standard, to make it possible to send a single message to a group of
   people in such a way that all of the recipients can read the email in
   their preferred language.  The methods of translation of the message
   content are beyond the scope of this document, but the structure of
   the email itself is defined herein.

   Whilst this document depends on identification of language in message
   parts for non-real-time communication, there is a companion document
   that is concerned with a similar problem for real-time communication:
   [I-D.ietf-slim-negotiating-human-language]

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  The Content-Type Header Field

   The "multipart/multilingual" MIME subtype allows the sending of a
   message in a number of different languages with the translations
   embedded in the same message.  This MIME subtype helps the receiving
   email client make sense of the message structure.

   The multipart subtype "multipart/multilingual" has similar semantics
   to "multipart/alternative" (as discussed in RFC 2046 [RFC2046]) in
   that each of the message parts is an alternative version of the same
   information.  The primary difference between "multipart/multilingual"
   and "multipart/alternative" is that when using "multipart/
   multilingual", the message part to select for rendering is chosen
   based on the values of the Content-Language field and optionally the
   Content-Translation-Type field instead of the ordering of the parts
   and the Content-Types.

   The syntax for this multipart subtype conforms to the common syntax
   for subtypes of multipart given in section 5.1.1. of RFC 2046
   [RFC2046].  An example "multipart/multilingual" Content-Type header
   field would look like this:

   Content-Type: multipart/multilingual; boundary=01189998819991197253

3.  The Message Parts

   A multipart/multilingual message will have a number of message parts:
   exactly one multilingual preface, one or more language message parts




Tomkinson & Borenstein  Expires February 19, 2018               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft       Multiple Language Content Type          August 2017


   and zero or one language independent message part.  The details of
   these are described below.

3.1.  The Multilingual Preface

   In order for the message to be received and displayed in non-
   conforming email clients, the message SHOULD contain an explanatory
   message part which MUST NOT be marked with a Content-Language field
   and MUST be the first of the message parts.  For maximum support in
   the most basic of non-conforming email clients, it SHOULD have a
   Content-Type of text/plain.  Because non-conforming email clients are
   expected to treat a message with an unknown multipart type as
   multipart/mixed (in accordance with sections 5.1.3 and 5.1.7 of RFC
   2046 [RFC2046]) they may show all of the message parts sequentially
   or as attachments.  Including and showing this explanatory part will
   help the message recipient understand the message structure.

   This initial message part SHOULD explain briefly to the recipient
   that the message contains multiple languages and the parts may be
   rendered sequentially or as attachments.  This SHOULD be presented in
   the same languages that are provided in the subsequent language
   message parts.

   As this explanatory section is likely to contain languages using
   scripts that require non-US-ASCII characters, it is RECOMMENDED that
   UTF-8 charset is used for this message part.  See RFC 3629 [RFC3629]
   for details of UTF-8.

   Whilst this section of the message is useful for backward
   compatibility, it will normally only be shown when rendered by a non-
   conforming email client, because conforming email clients SHOULD only
   show the single language message part identified by the user's
   preferred language and the language message part's Content-Language.

   For the correct display of the multilingual preface in a non-
   conforming email client, the sender MAY use the Content-Disposition
   field with a value of 'inline' in conformance with RFC 2183 [RFC2183]
   (which defines the Content-Disposition field).  If provided, this
   SHOULD be placed at the multipart/multilingual level and in the
   multilingual preface.  This makes it clear to a non-conforming email
   client that the multilingual preface should be displayed immediately
   to the recipient, followed by any subsequent parts marked as
   'inline'.

   For an example of a multilingual preface, see the examples in
   Section 8.

Internet-Draft       Multiple Language Content Type          August 2017


3.2.  The Language Message Parts

   The language message parts are typically translations of the same
   message content.  These message parts SHOULD be ordered so that the
   first part after the multilingual preface is in the language believed
   to be the most likely to be recognised by the recipient as this will
   constitute the default part when language negotiation fails and there
   is no Language Independent part.  All of the language message parts
   MUST have a Content-Language field and a Content-Type field and MAY
   have a Content-Translation-Type field.

   The Content-Type for each individual language message part SHOULD be
   message/rfc822 to provide good support with non-conforming email
   clients.  However, an implementation MAY use message/global as
   support for message/global becomes more commonplace.  See RFC 6532
   [RFC6532] for details of message/global.  Each language message part
   should have a Subject field in the appropriate language for that
   language part.  If there is a From field present, its value MUST
   include the same email address as the top-level From header although
   the display name MAY be a localised version.  If there is a mismatch
   of sender email address, the top-level From header value SHOULD be
   used to show to the recipient.

3.3.  The Language Independent Message Part

   If there is language independent content for the recipient to see if
   they have a preferred language other than one of those specified in
   the language message parts and the default language message part is
   unlikely to be understood, another part MAY be provided.  This part
   could typically include one or more language independent graphics.
   When this part is present, it MUST be the last part and MUST have a
   Content-Language field with a value of "zxx" (as described in BCP 47/
   RFC 5646 [RFC5646]).  The part SHOULD have a Content-Type of message/
   rfc822 or message/global (to match the language message parts).

4.  Message Part Selection

   The logic for selecting the message part to render and present to the
   recipient is summarised in the next few paragraphs.

   Firstly, if the email client does not understand multipart/
   multilingual then it will treat the message as if it was multipart/
   mixed and render message parts accordingly (in accordance with
   sections 5.1.3 and 5.1.7 of RFC 2046 [RFC2046]).

   If the email client does understand multipart/multilingual then it
   SHOULD ignore the multilingual preface and select the best match for
   the user's preferred language from the language message parts



Tomkinson & Borenstein  Expires February 19, 2018               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft       Multiple Language Content Type          August 2017


   available.  Also, the user may prefer to see the original message
   content in their second language over a machine translation in their
   first language.  The Content-Translation-Type field value can be used
   for further selection based on this preference.  The selection of
   language part may be implemented in a variety of ways, although the
   matching schemes detailed in RFC 4647 [RFC4647] are RECOMMENDED as a
   starting point for an implementation.  The goal is to render the most
   appropriate translation for the user.

   If there is no match for the user's preferred language (or there is
   no preferred language information available) the email client SHOULD
   select the language independent part (if one exists) or the first
   language part (directly after the multilingual preface) if a language
   independent part does not exist.

   If there is no translation type preference information available, the
   values of the Content-Translation-Type field may be ignored.

   Additionally, interactive implementations MAY offer the user a choice
   from among the available languages or the option to see them all.

5.  The Content-Language Field

   The Content-Language field in the individual language message parts
   is used to identify the language in which the message part is
   written.  Based on the value of this field, a conforming email client
   can determine which message part to display (given the user's
   language settings).

   The Content-Language MUST comply with RFC 3282 [RFC3282] (which
   defines the Content-Language field) and BCP 47/RFC 5646 [RFC5646]
   (which defines the structure and semantics for the language tag
   values).

   Examples of this field could look like the following:

   Content-Language: en-GB

   Content-Language: de

   Content-Language: es-MX, fr

   Content-Language: sr-Cyrl

Internet-Draft       Multiple Language Content Type          August 2017


6.  The Content-Translation-Type Field

   The Content-Translation-Type field can be used in the individual
   language message parts to identify the type of translation.  Based on
   the value of this parameter and the user's preferences, a conforming
   email client can determine which message part to display.

   This field can have one of three possible values: 'original', 'human'
   or 'automated' although other values may be added in the future.  A
   value of 'original' is given in the language message part that is in
   the original language.  A value of 'human' is used when a language
   message part is translated by a human translator or a human has
   checked and corrected an automated translation.  A value of
   'automated' is used when a language message part has been translated
   by an electronic agent without proofreading or subsequent correction.
   New values of the Content-Translation-Type header field
   ("translTypeExt" in the ABNF) are added according to procedure
   specified in Section 10.3.

   Examples of this field include:

   Content-Translation-Type: original

   Content-Translation-Type: human

   The syntax of the Content-Translation-Type field in ABNF RFC 5234
   [RFC5234] is:


   Content-Translation-Type = [FWS] translationtype

   FWS                      = <Defined in RFC 5322>
   translationtype          = "original" / "human" / "automated" /
                              translTypeExt
   translTypeExt            = 1*atext
   atext                    = <Defined in RFC 5322>

   This references RFC 5322 [RFC5322] for the pre-defined rules FWS and
   atext.

7.  The Subject Field in the Language Message parts

   On receipt of the message, conforming email clients will need to
   render the subject in the correct language for the recipient.  To
   enable this the Subject field SHOULD be provided in each language
   message part.  The value for this field should be a translation of
   the email subject.

Internet-Draft       Multiple Language Content Type          August 2017


   US-ASCII and 'encoded-word' examples of this field include:

   Subject: A really simple email subject

   Subject: =?UTF-8?Q?Un_asunto_de_correo_electr=C3=b3nico_
           realmente_sencillo?=

   See RFC 2047 [RFC2047] for the specification of 'encoded-word'.

   The subject to be presented to the recipient SHOULD be selected from
   the message part identified during the message part selection stage.
   If no Subject field is found the top-level Subject header field value
   should be used.

10.  IANA Considerations

10.1.  The multipart/multilingual MIME type

   The multipart/multilingual MIME type will be registered with IANA
   including a reference to this document.  This is the registration
   template:




















Tomkinson & Borenstein  Expires February 19, 2018              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft       Multiple Language Content Type          August 2017


   Media Type name: multipart

   Media subtype name: multilingual

   Required parameters: boundary (defined in RFC2046)

   Optional parameters: N/A

   Encoding considerations: There are no encoding considerations for
       this multipart other than that of the embedded body parts.
       The embedded body parts (typically one text/plain plus one or
       more message/*) may contain 7-bit, 8-bit or binary encodings.

   Security considerations: See the Security Considerations section
                            in RFC XXXX

   Interoperability considerations:
       Existing systems that do not treat unknown multipart subtypes
       as multipart/mixed may not correctly render a
       multipart/multilingual type. These systems would also be non-
       compliant with MIME.

   Author/Change controller: IETF

   Published specification: RFC XXXX

   Applications that use this media type:
       Mail Transfer Agents, Mail User Agents, spam detection,
       virus detection modules and message authentication modules.

   Additional information:
       Deprecated alias names for this type: N/A
       Magic number(s): N/A
       File extension(s): N/A
       Macintosh file type code(s): N/A

10.2.  The Content-Translation-Type Field

   The Content-Translation-Type field will be added to the IANA
   "Permanent Message Header Field Names" registry.  That entry will
   reference this document.  This is the registration template:

   Header field name: Content-Translation-Type

   Applicable protocol: mime

   Status: Standard

   Author/Change controller: IETF

   Specification document(s): RFC XXXX

   Related information: none

10.3.  The Content-Translation-Type Field Values

   IANA is requested to create a new registry for Content-Translation-
   Type Header Field values.  New values must be registered using
   "Specification Required" IANA registration procedure.  Registrations
   must include translation type value, short description and a URI of
   the specification.

   This document also registers 3 initial values specified below.


   Value: original
   Description:
       Content in the original language
   Reference: RFC XXXX

   Value: human
   Description:
       Content that has been translated by a human translator
       or a human has checked and corrected an automated translation
   Reference: RFC XXXX

   Value: automated
   Description:
       Content that has been translated by an electronic agent
       without proofreading or subsequent correction
   Reference: RFC XXXX

11.  Security Considerations

   Whilst it is intended that each language message part is a direct
   translation of the original message, this may not always be the case
   and these parts could contain undesirable content.  Therefore there
   is a possible risk that undesirable text or images could be shown to
   the recipient if the message is passed through a spam filter that
   does not check all of the message parts.  The risk should be minimal
   due to the fact that an unknown multipart subtype should be treated
   as multipart/mixed and so each message part should be subsequently
   scanned.

   If the email contains undesirable content in a language that the
   recipient cannot understand and this unknown content is assumed to be
   a direct translation of the content that the recipient can
   understand, the recipient may unintentionally forward undesirable
   content to a recipient that can understand it.  To mitigate this
   risk, an interactive implementation may allow the recipient to see
   all of the translations for comparison.

   Because the language message parts have a Content-Type of message/
   rfc822 or message/global, they might contain From fields which could
   have different values to that of the top-level From field and may not
   reflect the actual sender.  The inconsistent From field values might
   get shown to the recipient in a non-conforming email client and may
   mislead the recipient into thinking that the email came from someone
   other than the real sender.

12.10.  Changes from draft-ietf-slim-multilangcontent-05 to draft-ietf-
        slim-multilangcontent-06

   o  Changed parameter Translation-Type back to a new field to reduce
      the risk of breaking existing implementations that don't expect
      any parameters on Content-Language.

        slim-multilangcontent-09

   o  Removed the phrase "and SHOULD NOT have a Subject field and SHOULD
      NOT have a From field" in section 3.3 because the language
      independent part would be message/rfc822 or message/global so it
      is likely to have From and Subject fields.

   o  For the same reason as above, the phrase "(for example if the
      language independent part is selected)" was removed from section
      7.

   o  Phrase in part 3.3 was reworded from "This could typically be a
      language independent graphic" to "This could typically include a
      language independent graphic".
