               Abstract 
                   
                  This draft provides requirements for the support of generalized 
                  multi-protocol label switching (GMPLS) inter-domain traffic 
                  engineering (TE). Its main objective is to present the differences 
                  between MPLS inter-domain TE and GMPLS inter-domain TE.  This draft 
                  covers not only GMPLS Inter-domain architecture but also functional 
                  requirements in terms of GMPLS signaling and routing in order to 
                  specify these in a GMPLS Inter-domain environment.

               1. Introduction 
                   
                  Initial efforts of MPLS/GMPLS traffic engineering mechanism were 
                  focused on solving the problem within an Autonomous System (AS). 
                  Service Providers (SPs) have come up with requirements for extending 
                  TE mechanisms across the domains (ASes as well as areas) [Inter-
                  domain]. It discusses requirements for inter-domain Traffic 
                  Engineering mechanism with focus on packet MPLS networks and GMPLS 
                  packet switch capable (hereinafter MPLS). This document complements 
                  [Inter-domain] by providing some consideration for non-packet switch 
                  capable GMPLS networks (hereinafter GMPLS) scalability and 
                  operational efficiency in such a networking environment. 
                   
                  TE information exchanged over domains for signaling and routing GMPLS 
                  Label Switched Paths (LSPs) is more stringent than that of MPLS LSPs 
                  [MPLS-AS] from the point of an effective operation. This is because 
                  in order to dynamically or statically establish GMPLS LSPs, the 
                  additional TE information, e.g., interface switching capability, link 
                  encoding, protection, and so forth must be considered. Operators may 
                  use different switching capable nodes and TE links with different 
                  encoding type and bandwidth, decided by their business strategy and 
                  such TE information exchange is expected to improve operational 
                  efficiency in GMPLS-controlled networks. 
                   
                  In terms of signaling, GMPLS signaling must operate over multiple 
                  domains using routing information, exchanged TE information or a 
                  statistically configured domain-to-domain route. This signaling 
                  request should take into account bi-directionality, switching 
                  capability, encoding type, SRLG, and protection attributes of the TE 
                  links spanned by the path, as well as LSP encoding type and switching 
                  type for the end points. Furthermore, GMPLS LSP nesting may be 
                  applicable at the GMPLS domain borders and should be considered 
                  accordingly. 
                   
                  This document provides the requirements for the support of GMPLS 
                  inter-domain TE, investigates the necessity of dynamic or static TE 
                  information exchange between GMPLS-controlled domains and describes 
                  the TE link parameters for this routing operation.  This document 
                  also outlines GMPLS inter-domain architecture, and provides 
                  functional requirements in terms of GMPLS signaling, routing and 
                  management in order to specify these in a GMPLS inter-domain 
                  environment.

                  domains, assumed in this document. D1, D2, D3 and D4 have multiple 
                  GMPLS inter-domain connections, and D5 has only one GMPLS inter-
                  domain connection. These domains follow the definition in [inter-
                  domain].

                                Figure 1: GMPLS Inter-domain network model 
                   
                  Each domain is configured using various switching and link 
                  technologies defined in [Arch] and an end-to-end route needs to 
                  respect TE link attributes like multiplexing type, encoding type, 
                  etc., making the problem a bit different from the case of classical 
                  (packet) MPLS. In order to route from one GMPLS domain to another 
                  GMPLS domain appropriately, each domain needs to advertise additional 
                  TE information, while concealing its internal topology information. 
                  In addition, a signaling mechanism is required to specify a route 
                  consisting of multiple domains, while respecting the end-point∆s 
                  encoding, switching and payload type. Section 4 describes the TE link 
                  attributes that need to be exchanged across the domain boundary in 
                  detail. 
                   
                   
                  3.2 Comparison between a GMPLS inter-domain and a MPLS inter-domain  
                   
                  (1) GMPLS network model 
                   
                  To investigate the difference between a GMPLS inter-domain and an 
                  MPLS inter-domain network, we assume the network model shown in Fig. 
                  2. Without loss of generality, this network model consists of two 
                  GMPLS domains. The GMPLS domain border nodes (A3, A4, B1, B2) are 
                  connected via traffic engineering (TE) links (A3-B1 and A4-B2). These 
                  inter-domain TE links are assumed to have a certain amount of 
                  bandwidth (bw), e.g., 2.5Gbit/s, 10Gbit/s, etc. Moreover, each nodes 
                  in both domain 1 and domain 2 can support x and y switching 
                  capabilities (e.g., x or y means TDM, Lambda or fiber). The edge node 
                  of the network (possibly A1, A2, B3, and B4) may also have the 
                  switching capability of packet (PSC1-4). Moreover, each TE link has a 
                  z or w encoding type (z or w means SONET/SDH, Lambda, Ethernet, etc.).

                              Figure 2: GMPLS Inter-domain network model (1) 
                   
                   
                  Between GMPLS domain border nodes, the routing information is 
                  statically or dynamically exchanged. Link management protocol (LMP) 
                  [LMP] may be applied to maintain and manage TE links between GMPLS 
                  domain border nodes. 
                   
                  In general, the switching capability at each end of two TE-Links (A3-
                  B1 and A4-B2) between domain border nodes shall not be always same. 
                  Therefore, GMPLS nodes shall need to identify the attributes of these 
                  TE-Links in order to create LSP over multiple domains. At present, 
                  GMPLS/ MPLS technology does not provide the functionality to 
                  discriminate such attributes through a flooding mechanism. 
                  Furthermore, these GMPLS specific requirements for inter-domain 
                  traffic engineering are not described in [Inter-domain]. 
                   
                  (2) MPLS network model 
                   
                  In the packet MPLS network, we can assume the MPLS inter-domain 
                  network model as shown in Figure 3. There are no routing constraints 
                  such as switching capability and encoding type, compared to the GMPLS 
                  inter-domain network model. All nodes have the same switching 
                  capability of packet, therefore there is no need to distribute 
                  switching capability information between the domains.

                                Figure 3: MPLS Inter-domain network model 
                   
                   
                  In the following section, we consider an MPLS or GMPLS path setup 
                  from an edge node in domain 1 to an edge node in domain 2. 
                   
                   
               4. Requirement of exchanging TE information across domain boundaries 
                
                  In this section, we describe the TE attributes that needs to be 
                  exchanged across the domain boundaries for computation of GMPLS Paths. 
                   
                  4.1 Interface Switching Capability 
                   
                  A constraint of bandwidth in a GMPLS controlled network is different 
                  from that in an IP/MPLS network. In Figure 3, two TE links with 
                  different values of bandwidth such as 2.5Gbit/s and 10Gbit/s are 
                  assumed. If an MPLS LSP with 2.5Gbit/s bandwidth is established from 
                  A2 to B4 in Figure 3, two sets of TE links (that is two possible 
                  paths) can be selected (A2-A4-B2-B4 and A2-A1-A3-B1-B3-B4). 
                   
                  In the case of inter-domain GMPLS, the ingress node needs to know the 
                  switching capabilities supported in each domain, while computing a 
                  route for a GMPLS-LSP across multiple domains. If the switching 
                  capabilities are exchanged across the domain boundaries, the ingress 
                  node can determine the appropriate next-hop domain that is capable of 
                  supporting the requesting switching capability. 
                   
                  In the example of Figure 4, we assume a switching capability as 
                  lambda and an encoding type as lambda. The bandwidth of each TE link 
                  is, for example, corresponding to the transponder∆s bit rate of each 
                  DWDM channel. In this case, both inter-domain links may be acceptable 
                  from A2 to B4 if only TE information within each domain is considered.  
                  However, a GMPLS LSP with 2.5Gbit/s bandwidth can not be established 
                  over a set of TE links (A2-A4-B2-B4) because all nodes support only 
                  LSC which can not deal with sub-rate switching, and the 10Gbit/s TE 
                  link can only support a GMPLS LSP with 10Gbit/s. The set of TE links 
                  (A2-A1-A3-B1-B3-B4) must be used instead so as to route it over the 
                  inter-domain link of A3-B1. 
                   
                  If multiple GMPLS routes exist for a given destination via different 
                  domains, a path should be selected satisfying these routing 
                  constraints, in addition to the conventional attributes which the 
                  intra-domain routing protocols.  LMP protocol may assist to know 
                  attributes of the neighbor node, but it does not assure such 
                  attributes learned from LMP are consistent within the domain.  
                  Although an operator may want to specify a domain border node 
                  explicitly for such a destination, this TE information exchange will 
                  improve operational efficiency in GMPLS-controlled networks. 
                  Therefore, not only intra-domain routing protocols [GMPLS-Routing] 
                  but also inter-domain routing protocol needs to advertise some TE 
                  parameters.

                  4.2 Bandwidth Policy 
                   
                  The advertisement of the bandwidth for traversing non-local domains 
                  is strongly dependent on the operational policy in each GMPLS domain.  
                  The resource available for different domains may be advertised over 
                  GMPLS inter-domain boundaries, although the actual local bandwidth is 
                  more than that for different domains. The GMPLS domain border nodes 
                  have the functionality to control the advertised resource bandwidth 
                  to reach a destination. For example, even if 4 times OC-48 bandwidth 
                  exists to a destination in one GMPLS domain, the domain may advertise 
                  only twice OC-48 bandwidth to another GMPLS domain, following the 
                  mutual policy between these two domains.  Thus, inter-domain 
                  reachability information may need to be enhanced to include bandwidth 
                  information, however, such flooding information may degrade the 
                  network scalability, and policy features at the border node may be 
                  useful not so as to maintain the same scalability of a single domain.  
                   
                   
                  4.3 Encoding type 
                   
                  In addition of the link switching type, an end-to-end GMPLS LSP needs 
                  to have the same encoding type at all intermediate hops. In this 
                  section, we discuss the need for exchanging link encoding types 
                  across the domain boundaries. 
                   
                  The example depicted in Figure 5 is considered where TE links with a 
                  different encoding type in a GMPLS Inter-domain network are assumed. 
                  In this case, differing from the case of a packet MPLS inter-domain 
                  network, a GMPLS LSP with a specific encoding type must be 
                  established to satisfy this constraint. Since physical layer 
                  technologies used to form TE links limit the signal encoding type to 
                  be transported, the ingress node should consider this by obtaining TE 
                  parameters exchanged between GMPLS-controlled inter-domains. In this 
                  case, both inter-domain links may be acceptable for routing from A2 
                  to B4 if only TE information within each domain is considered. The 
                  set of TE links (A2-A1-A3-B1-B3-B4) must be used instead so as to

                  route over the inter domain-link of A3-B1, satisfying the constraint 
                  of the encoding type. Therefore, inter-domain reachability 
                  information needs to be enhanced to include encoding type information.

                  In Figure 6, we consider a mixed case of 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, and assume 
                  two domains: Domain 1 consisting of GMPLS nodes with TDM-SC and TE 
                  links with SONET/SDH encoding type, and domain 2 consisting of GMPLS 
                  nodes with LSC and TE links with lambda encoding type. GMPLS nodes in 
                  domain 2 support sub-rate switching, for example, of 2.5Gbit/s.

                  If a GMPLS LSP with 2.5Gbit/s is established from A2 to B4, the 
                  ingress node should know not only the reachability of B4 in domain 2, 
                  but also the switching capability of nodes in domain 2.  In this case, 
                  both inter-domain links may be acceptable for routing from A2 to B4 
                  if only TE information within each domain is considered. However, 
                  since the switching capability supported in each domain is different, 
                  the set of TE links (A2-A1-A3-B1-B3-B4) must be used so as to route

                  over the inter domain-link of A3-B1. Therefore, an end-point 
                  (reachability) list such as node IDs, interface addresses, interface 
                  IDs per switching capability is very useful and may be advertised 
                  over GMPLS domains. 
                   
                   
                  4.5 SRLG 
                   
                  To configure a secondary LSP in addition to a primary LSP over 
                  multiple GMPLS domains, the parameter of Shared Risk Link Group 
                  (SRLG) is very significant. By introducing this parameter, the source 
                  node can route these LSPs so as to across the different domain border 
                  node as well as satisfy a SRLG constraint. Although this SRLG is 
                  supported and defined within domains, the mechanism to maintain 
                  consistency of SRLG must be considered in a GMPLS inter-domain TE 
                  environment. 
                   
                  There are cases where two different SPs may be sharing the same fate 
                  (facility) for TE links within domains administrated by them. However, 
                  presently there is no mechanism to allow SRLG to have global 
                  significance; SRLG administration is completely up to interconnected 
                  SPs. 
                   
                  In this document we identify that, in order to guarantee the SRLG 
                  diversity requirement, the SRLGs in an inter-domain TE environment 
                  are required to be globally unique. 
                   
                   
                  4.6 Protection Type 
                   
                  To guarantee the GMPLS LSP's resiliency over multiple GMPLS domains, 
                  the protection type in each domain should be carefully selected so as 
                  to satisfy resilient requirement of the LSP as an end-to-end manner. 
                  This enables us to establish a LSP with a protection mechanism per 
                  domain-basis, such as link or node protection. Each GMPLS domain will 
                  provide a type of the protection to a destination within itself. 
                  Otherwise, an end-to-end recovery may be provided by calculating at 
                  the source node with the consideration of SRLG. As the same with the 
                  SRLG case, protection type administration is also up to the 
                  interconnected SPs. Therefore, inter-domain reachability information 
                  needs to be enhanced to include protection type information.

                  5.1 Requirement for GMPLS inter-domain signaling for the support of 
                  TE 
                   
                  GMPLS inter-domain signaling must establish GMPLS LSPs over GMPLS 
                  multiple domains relying on a dynamic calculation of the domain-to-
                  domain route and GMPLS domain border nodes by path computation 
                  functions spread through the domains. It also must support to

                  explicitly specify domain-to-domain routes, domain border nodes or 
                  GMPLS nodes. Moreover, specifying loose GMPLS nodes including GMPLS 
                  domain border nodes must be supported in GMPLS signaling. The domain 
                  border node received GMPLS signaling message from a source node in a 
                  different domain should support recalculation mechanisms to specify 
                  the route within its domain, such as RSVP route expansion technique, 
                  followed by GMPLS inter-domain path computation.   
                   
                   
                  5.1.1 GMPLS per-domain basis path calculation support 
                   
                  Firstly, GMPLS per-domain basis path calculation is described. In 
                  this path calculation model, a GMPLS LSP head-end specifies GMPLS 
                  domain border nodes as loose hops to tail-end statically or 
                  dynamically [Path-comp]. The route information may be learned from 
                  the GMPLS EGP. The source node also calculates the intermediate nodes 
                  to reach the selected egress domain border node. 
                   
                  Once the GMPLS path message has traversed to the connecting domain 
                  border node in the adjacent domain, another path calculation is 
                  conducted, for example, to expand the ERO carried in the RSVP-TE Path 
                  message to reach its destination, otherwise to reach an egress border 
                  node transiting to another domain. This path calculation will not 
                  necessarily guarantee the domain-to-domain path optimality. 
                   
                   
                  5.1.2 GMPLS end-to-end basis path calculation support 
                   
                  GMPLS end-to-end basis path calculation is indicated next. In this 
                  path calculation, the GMPLS LSP head-end specifies an domain-to-
                  domain route (for example, domain1-domain2-domain4-domain5 in Figure 
                  1) as well as the intermediate nodes to the egress domain border node 
                  in its belonging domain. The domain border node in an adjacent domain 
                  will determine intermediate nodes followed by the specified domain 
                  path route. This path calculation will guarantee the domain path 
                  optimality, however, not necessarily guarantee end-to-end path 
                  optimality. 
                   
                   
                  5.1.3 Fast Recovery support 
                   
                  Fast recovery operation based on the end-to-end [e2e] and segment 
                  [SEG-RECOVERY] based approach should be supported over multiple GMPLS 
                  domains, considering inter-domain link, SRLG and node diversity. 
                  These types of operation should interoperate with GMPLS intra-domain 
                  TE fast recovery mechanism. The domain border node may respond 
                  indicating a path setup error if it does not support the 
                  protection/restoration mechanism which is requested by the signaling 
                  messages generated from the source node in the different domain. 
                   
                  Depending on the recovery mode, re-optimization or revertive 
                  operations should be supported.

                  5.1.4 Policy Control 
                   
                  Depending on the policy between domains, the domain border GMPLS 
                  nodes may reject GMPLS inter-domain signaling messages if the 
                  unapproved objects are included. 
                   
                   
                  5.2 Requirement for GMPLS Inter-domain routing for the support of TE 
                   
                  In IP/MPLS networks, inter-AS routing such as the EGP is well-defined 
                  and widely deployed. However, the need for such inter-domain routing 
                  extension for MPLS TE does not exist at present. Nonetheless, inter-
                  domain routing extensions are required to support multiple GMPLS 
                  domains as well as for layer 1 VPN [L1VPN]. GMPLS extension for 
                  multi-domain TE is required for guaranteeing inter-domain GMPLS 
                  constraints, when attempts are made to establish GMPLS LSPs over 
                  multiple domains as discussed in section 4. 
                   
                   
                  5.2.1 Reachability information exchange 
                   
                  GMPLS inter-domain routing mechanism must support the exchange of 
                  reachability information over each domain.  Reachability information 
                  includes: 
                        
                       (1) Node ID 
                       (2) Interface address 
                       (3) Interface ID 
                   
                  The reachability information must be advertised in accordance with 
                  their belonging domain information in order to calculate the GMPLS 
                  LSP over multiple domains.  The reachability information may be 
                  aggregated depending on the domain∆s policy. 
                   
                   
                  The scalability of inter-domain routing should be considered in 
                  designing GMPLS extensions to allow exchange of TE information in 
                  addition to the above reachability information. Furthermore, the 
                  GMPLS inter-domain routing should be designed to achieve such 
                  operation that defects in one domain do not affect the scalability of 
                  an intra-domain routing of IGPs in other domains, although the GMPLS 
                  inter-domain routing should promptly advertise the failure within the 
                  domain, ensuring the GMPLS inter-domain connection establishment. 
                   
                  GMPLS inter-domain routing must basically follow the GMPLS 
                  architecture [Arch], including the support of its exchange over out 
                  of band control channel. 
                   
                  5.2.2 TE parameters exchange 
                   
                  Coinciding with MPLS Inter-domain work, the TE parameters for GMPLS 
                  Inter-domain routing are considered to be added.

                  A GMPLS domain border node may be required to announce the following 
                  parameters in association with reachability information of node IDs, 
                  interface addresses and interface IDs. 
                   
                  (1) Interface switching capability 
                       (1-1)Bandwidth 
                               A. Total link bandwidth

                               D. minimum LSP Bandwidth 
                               C. Unreserved bandwidth 
                       (1-2)Switching capability:  PSC1-4, L2SC, TDM, lambda, LSC, FSC 
                  (2) Bandwidth Encoding type: As defined in [RFC3471], e.g., Ethernet, 
                  SONET/SDH, Lambda. 
                  (3) SRLG (Global view) 
                  (4) Protection type 
                   
                  As mentioned in section 4.4, an end-point (reachability) list 
                  consisting of node IDs, interface addresses, interface IDs per 
                  switching capability is formed in order to be advertised over GMPLS 
                  domains. 
                   
                  For stitched, nested and contiguous GMPLS LSPs over multiple domains, 
                  a GMPLS LSP created within a domain will be announced as a (transit) 
                  link resource (FA-LSP) exposed to different domains with appropriate 
                  TE parameters, while abstracting intermediate nodes or interface 
                  addresses. We may virtually provision logical TE links (virtual TE 
                  link) instead of such FA-LSPs for this purpose. Virtual TE link is a 
                  new concept and will be clarified in a later version of this draft. 
                  The GMPLS inter-domain routing should support this functionality and 
                  locally configure this on the domain border nodes. 
                   
                  To ensure future interworking operation between GMPLS and MPLS, the 
                  GMPLS inter-domain routing should be also applicable to MPLS inter-
                  domain TE information exchange. 
                   
                   
                  5.2.3 Reachability information redistribution requirement 
                   
                  GMPLS inter-domain routing must provide redistribution mechanisms 
                  within the domain in a scalable manner. These information 
                  redistribution mechanisms must be designed to achieve such operation 
                  that a defect in a domain does not affect the scalability of intra-
                  domain routing in a different domain, although the GMPLS inter-domain 
                  routing must promptly advertise the failure within the domain, 
                  ensuring the GMPLS inter-domain connection establishment. 
                   
                  Mechanisms for redistributing GMPLS TE information within the GMPLS 
                  domain can be, for example, a path computation element (PCE), I-BGP 
                  session, or re-injection to IGP. Especially, it is useful to adopt 
                  GMPLS end-to-end basis path calculation. PCE based requirement may be 
                  incorporated with the PCE Architecture document [PCE].

                  GMPLS inter-domain routing must have the functionality to consider 
                  any policies for controlling TE routing information to be flooded, 
                  which will be defined between domains on a business or operational 
                  strategy basis. GMPLS inter-domain routing policy should be able to 
                  be changed and configured on a per domain basis. This policy control 
                  especially in terms of switching capability may be applicable to the 
                  extensions of hierarchical routing. Each domain should control the 
                  advertisement of the switching capability or re-advertisement of 
                  received switching capability. 
                   
                   
                  5.2.4 VPN-associated information exchange 
                   
                  In addition to reachability and TE information exchange, VPN-
                  associated information may be exchanged as a part of routing 
                  information to support L1-VPN functionality, or by other means. VPN-
                  associated information may include: 
                   
                       (1) VPN identifier (such as VPN IP as specified in RFC2685, or 
                        route target) 
                       (2) Scope of reachability information exchanged 
                       (3) VPN membership information 
                       (4) CP-CP arbitrary control plane communication 
                       (5) VPN performance related information 
                   
                  This is exchanged across domains, but may not be injected into other 
                  domains. 
                   
                   
                  5.3 GMPLS inter-domain TE Management 
                   
                  5.3.1 GMPLS inter-domain TE Fault Management 
                   
                  To maintain the control channel session as well as to provide fault 
                  isolation mechanism, link management mechanisms such as [LMP] should 
                  be applied to TE links between GMPLS domain border nodes. To validate 
                  LSPs created over multiple domains, a generic tunnel tracing protocol 
                  (GTTP) may be applied [GTTP]. 
                   
                  5.3.2 GMPLS inter-domain TE MIB Requirements 
                   
                  GMPLS inter-domain TE Management Information Bases must be supported 
                  to manage and configure GMPLS inter-domain TE in terms of GMPLS LSPs, 
                  routing, TE links and so forth.  These MIBs should extend the 
                  existing series of MIBs [GMPLS-TEMIB] to accommodate following 
                  functionalities; 
                   
                  - To manage GMPLS LSP characteristics at the tunnel head-end as well 
                    as any other points of the TE tunnel. 
                  - To include both IPv4/v6 and domain identifier, or only domain 
                    identifier in the subobjects of GMPLS RSVP ERO. A label may be 
                    included in it.  The example of the object is as follows; 
                     
                    EXPLICIT_ROUTE class object:

                  - Inclusion of recording subobjects such as interface IPv4/v6 
                    addresses, domain identifier, a label, a node-id and so on in 
                    the RRO of the RESV message, considering the established policies 
                    between GMPLS domains. 
                   
                   
               6. Security consideration 
                   
                  GMPLS inter-domain TE should be implemented under a certain security 
                  consideration such as authentication of signaling and routing on the 
                  control plane as well as a data plane itself.  Indeed, this will not 
                  change the underlying security issues.

               8. Intellectual property considerations 
                   
                  The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any 
                  Intellectual Property Rights or other rights that might be claimed to 
                  pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in 
                  this document or the extent to which any license under such rights 
                  might or might not be available; nor does it represent that it has 
                  made any independent effort to identify any such rights.  Information 
                  on the procedures with respect to rights in RFC documents can be 
                  found in BCP 78 and BCP 79. 
                   
                  Copies of IPR disclosures made to the IETF Secretariat and any 
                  assurances of licenses to be made available, or the result of an 
                  attempt made to obtain a general license or permission for the use of 
                  such proprietary rights by implementers or users of this 
                  specification can be obtained from the IETF on-line IPR repository at
