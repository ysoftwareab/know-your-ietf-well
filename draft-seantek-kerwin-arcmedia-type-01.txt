1.  Introduction

   The purpose of this memo is to update [RFC2045] and [RFC6838] to
   include a new top-level media type to be known as "archive".
   [RFC6838] describes mechanisms for specifying and describing the
   format of Internet Message Bodies via media type/subtype pairs.
   "archive" defines a fundamental type of media with unique
   presentational, hardware, and processing aspects.  Various subtypes
   of this top-level type are immediately anticipated, and will be
   covered under separate documents.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Definition of an archive

   The archive top-level media type identifies a container of one or
   more data objects and metadata about them.  Archives are used to
   collect multiple data objects together into a single object for
   easier portability and storage.  Archive formats can provide many
   optional services, including:

   1.  compression

   2.  encryption

   3.  authentication

   4.  backup and restoration

   5.  filesystem imaging

   6.  software packaging and distribution

   7.  volume-splitting (archive split into multiple objects)

   8.  block storage

   Formats and techniques that support one or more of these services
   already exist under separate registrations.  For example, the
   Content-Encoding header can be used to signal compressed Internet
   message content.  The distinguishing feature of the archive top-level
   type is that these services are integrated into the format itself,
   along with the inclusion of object-specific metadata.

   Formats contemplated under this top-level type are designed to
   concatenate multiple objects into a single data stream, along with
   names and other metadata.  When an Internet-facing application
   handles content labeled with this type, it SHOULD treat the archive
   as a discrete data item.  For example, an Internet mail user agent
   might display an archive-labeled type with an archive icon, possibly
   with a preview of the objects contained therein, as opposed to
   automatically extracting its contents.

3.  Encoding and Transport

   Unrecognized subtypes of archive SHOULD be treated as "archive/file".
   Like "application/octet-stream", the purpose of the "archive/file"
   type is to provide default handling; it does not represent a
   particular archive format.  Implementations SHOULD defer handling of
   unrecognized subtypes of archive to a robust general-purpose archive
   processing application, if such an application is available.

   If default archive handling is not supported, the archive MAY be
   treated as if it were "application/octet-stream".

   Unless noted in the subtype registration, subtypes of archive MUST be
   assumed to contain binary data, implying the use of base64 content
   encoding for email and binary transfer for ftp and http.

4.  Registration Template

   The formal syntax for the subtypes of the archive top-level type
   SHOULD look like this:

      Required parameters:
            none

      Optional parameters:
            TBD

      Encoding considerations:
            base64 encoding is recommended when transmitting archive/*
            documents through MIME electronic mail.

            TBD

      Fragment identifier considerations:
            The considerations of this document, plus any extra syntaxes
            not inconsistent with this document.

      Additional information:

            Deprecated alias names for this type:  (Include non-archive
                     alias names, such as those in application.)

            Magic number(s): TBD

            File extension(s): TBD

            TBD (COMMON will be the most common)

      Restrictions on usage:
            TBD

            TBD

      Provisional registration? (standards tree only):
            (Yes/No)

      (Any other information that the author deems interesting may be
      added below this line.)

   The optional parameters consist of starting conditions and variable
   values used as part of the subtypes.

5.  Common Required and Optional Parameters

   Archive formats usually include parameteric meta-data within the
   format.  Consequently, subtypes of archive SHOULD NOT specify the
   same information as parameters to the type.

   Some archive formats are very old, or are designed to be backwards-
   compatible with older formats, and as such might not have been
   designed with transport across the Internet in mind.  For example,
   modern versions of the ZIP file format [ZIP] include support for the
   Universal Character Set [ISO10646], however the default encoding of
   filenames within a ZIP archive has always been Code Page 437 [CP437].
   Due to the historical nature of archives, and to support
   interoperability with older implementations, sometimes it is
   preferable to communicate the archive as-is, rather than updating it
   to a more modern or universal format.

   Implementations that are archive-type aware MUST support the
   following parameters for maximum compatibility.  At the same time,
   new archive types SHOULD NOT rely on these parameters for
   disambiguation; new archive types SHOULD be designed in such a way
   that "universal" interoperability is achieved using information
   contained within the archive format itself.

   [[TODO: write this list]]

   o  Code Page - like charset but only applies to certain strings in
      the archive, when the archive format is ambiguous.  Do not attempt
      to apply this parameter as one would apply charset to text/*

   o  Endianness?

   o  Time/Y2K representation issues?

   o  Anything else?

6.  Split Archives

   Several archive formats (notably RAR and ZIP) support split archives.
   A "split archive" can be stored in multiple files, or more generally,
   across multiple storage media.

   For example, the ZIP format supports two types of splits: "split
   archive" and "spanned archive".  A "split archive" is a standard ZIP
   archive split over multiple files using file extensions .z01, .z02,
   etc.; the final file in the sequence uses the .zip file extension.
   The "spanned archive" was designed for use on floppy disks with
   restrictive space limitations; all archive files have the same
   filename, and volume labels (presumably on floppy disks) are used to
   store sequence information.  Neither sub-format is merely a naive
   division of the octet stream: each ZIP file is parseable in its own
   right, and contains its own offset values.

   The TAR format (or family of formats, including cpio and ustar) was
   originally designed for streaming to and from tape devices, so
   splitting is accomplished differently.

   [[TODO: Consider how to label this content. archive/zip^01? archive/
   zip; split=01?  Something else?  How shall 01 be associated with 02,
   03, etc., when the Content-Disposition: ; filename="" parameter is
   "presentation-information" and may be separated from the Content-Type
   header information?]]

7.  Fragment Identifier Syntax

   As archives usually store objects in hierarchical structures similar
   to filesystems, archives can serve as virtual filesystems.
   Respondents have noted that the objects stored in an archive can be
   addressed by a fragment syntax that resembles a filesystem path.  At
   the same time, archives can store objects in different ways (along
   with different types of metadata), suggesting that a common baseline
   with flexible extension points is more appropriate than a fixed
   universal syntax.  [[TODO: This will be explored in future drafts.
   Note the similarities with this and the file: URI...]]

Internet-Draft                  arcmedia                        May 2015


   [[TODO: consider how to provide a fragment for content in the
   archive.  NB: most archives do NOT provide Content-Type/media type
   information!  So /foo.html being an HTML file is just an
   _assumption_, and possibly a very wrong one at that.  There is no
   IETF registry for file extensions.]]

8.  Piped-Composite Type Suffix Syntax

   [[TODO: discuss tar piped through bzip2, gzip, etc. as a distinct
   file format, rather than an application of the Content-Encoding:
   header.  Suggest common suffix like archive/tar|bzip2, where | is
   some useful character but not + since + is for structured syntaxes.]]

9.  Security Considerations

   Archives can store files, file metadata, and even entire filesystems;
   thus, security issues loom large because archives can contain just
   about anything.  These concerns are magnified by the arbitrary
   transport of such data across the Internet.  [[TODO: complete.]]
