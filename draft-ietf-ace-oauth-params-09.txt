      Additional OAuth Parameters for Authorization in Constrained
                           Environments (ACE)
                     draft-ietf-ace-oauth-params-09

Abstract

   This specification defines new parameters for the OAuth 2.0 token and
   introspection endpoints when used with the framework for
   authentication and authorization for constrained environments (ACE).
   These are used to express the proof-of-possession key the client
   wishes to use, the proof-of-possession key that the Authorization
   Server has selected, and the key the Resource Server should use to
   authenticate to the client.

1.  Introduction

   The Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments
   (ACE) specification [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz] requires some new
   parameters for interactions with the OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] token and
   introspection endpoints, as well as some new claims to be used in
   access tokens.  These parameters and claims can also be used in other
   contexts and have therefore been put into a dedicated document, to
   facilitate their use in a manner independent of
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].

   Note that although all examples are shown in CBOR [RFC7049], JSON
   [RFC8259] MAY be used as an alternative for HTTP-based
   communications, as specified in [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Readers are assumed to be familiar with the terminology from
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz], especially the terminology for entities
   in the architecture such as client (C), resource server (RS) and
   authorization server (AS).

   Terminology from [RFC8152] is used in the examples, especially
   COSE_Key defined in section 7 of [RFC8152].

   Note that the term "endpoint" is used here following its OAuth 2.0
   [RFC6749] definition, which is to denote resources such as token and
   introspection at the AS and authz-info at the RS.  The CoAP [RFC7252]
   definition, which is "An entity participating in the CoAP protocol"
   is not used in this specification.

3.  Parameters for the Token Endpoint

   This section defines additional parameters for the interations with
   the token endpoint in the ACE framework [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].

3.1.  Client-to-AS Request

   This section defines the "req_cnf" parameter allowing clients to
   request a specific proof-of-possession key in an access token from a
   token endpoint in the ACE framework [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]:

   req_cnf
      OPTIONAL.  This field contains information about the key the
      client would like to bind to the access token for proof-of-
      possession.  It is RECOMMENDED that an AS reject a request
      containing a symmetric key value in the 'req_cnf' field
      (kty=Symmetric), since the AS is expected to be able to generate
      better symmetric keys than a constrained client.  The AS MUST
      verify that the client really is in possession of the
      corresponding key.  Values of this parameter follow the syntax of
      the "cnf" claim from section 3.1 of
      [I-D.ietf-ace-cwt-proof-of-possession].

   Figure 1 shows a request for an access token using the "req_cnf"
   parameter to request a specific public key as proof-of-possession

3.2.  AS-to-Client Response

   This section defines the following additional parameters for an AS
   response to a request to the token endpoint:

   cnf
      REQUIRED if the token type is "pop" and a symmetric key is used.
      MAY be present for asymmetric proof-of-possession keys.  This
      field contains the proof-of-possession key that the AS selected
      for the token.  Values of this parameter follow the syntax of the
      "cnf" claim from section 3.1 of
      [I-D.ietf-ace-cwt-proof-of-possession].  See Section 5 for
      additional discussion of the usage of this parameter.


   rs_cnf
      OPTIONAL if the token type is "pop" and asymmetric keys are used.
      MUST NOT be present otherwise.  This field contains information
      about the public key used by the RS to authenticate.  If this
      parameter is absent, either the RS does not use a public key or
      the AS knows that the RS can authenticate itself to the client
      without additional information.  Values of this parameter follow
      the syntax of the "cnf" claim from section 3.1 of

3.3.  The Resource Server Confirmation Claim

   If the AS needs to convey a hint to the RS about which key it should
   use to authenticate towards the client, this specification defines
   the "rs_cnf" claim, which MAY be used in the access token, with the
   same syntax and semantics as defined in for the "rs_cnf" parameter.

4.  Parameters for the Introspection Endpoint

   This section defines additional parameters for the interations with
   the introspection endpoint in the ACE framework
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].

4.1.  AS-to-RS Response

   This section defines the following additional parameters for an AS
   response to a request to the introspection endpoint:

   cnf
      OPTIONAL.  This field contains information about the proof-of-
      possession key that binds the client to the access token.  Values
      of this parameter follow the syntax of the "cnf" claim from
      section 3.1 of [I-D.ietf-ace-cwt-proof-of-possession].  See
      Section 5 for additional discussion of the usage of this
      parameter.

   rs_cnf
      OPTIONAL.  If the RS uses asymmetric keys to authenticate towards
      the client (e.g., with a DTLS Raw Public Key handshake [RFC7250]
      and it has several such keys (e.g., for different elliptic
      curves), the AS can give the RS a hint using this parameter, as to
      which key it should use.  Values of this parameter follow the
      syntax of the "cnf" claim from section 3.1 of
      [I-D.ietf-ace-cwt-proof-of-possession].  See Section 5 for
      additional discussion of the usage of this parameter.

   Figure 4 shows an AS response to an introspection request including
   the "cnf" parameter to indicate the proof-of-possession key bound to
   the token and the "rs_cnf" parameter to indicate the key the RS is
   supposed to use to authenticate to the client.

5.  Confirmation Method Parameters

   The confirmation method parameters are used as follows:

   o  "req_cnf" in the access token request C -> AS, OPTIONAL to
      indicate the client's raw public key, or the key-identifier of a
      previously established key between C and RS that the client wishes
      to use for proof-of-possession of the access token.

   o  "cnf" in the token response AS -> C, OPTIONAL if using an
      asymmetric key or a key that the client requested via a key
      identifier in the request.  REQUIRED if the client didn't specify
      a "req_cnf" and symmetric keys are used.  Used to indicate the
      symmetric key generated by the AS for proof-of-possession of the
      access token.

   o  "cnf" in the introspection response AS -> RS, REQUIRED if the
      access token that was subject to introspection is a proof-of-
      possession token, absent otherwise.  Indicates the proof-of-
      possession key bound to the access token.

   o  "rs_cnf" in the token response AS -> C, OPTIONAL to indicate the
      public key of the RS, if it uses one to authenticate itself to the
      client and the binding between key and RS identity is not
      established through other means.

   o  "rs_cnf" in the introspection response AS -> RS, OPTIONAL,
      contains the public key that the RS should use for authenticating
      itself to the client (e.g., if the RS has several different public
      keys, and there may be ambiguity as to which key to use).

   Note that the COSE_Key structure in a confirmation claim or parameter
   may contain an "alg" or "key_ops" parameter.  If such parameters are
   present, a client MUST NOT use a key that is incompatible with the
   profile or proof-of-possession algorithm according to those
   parameters.  An RS MUST reject a proof-of-possession using such a
   key.

   If an access token is issued for an audience that includes several
   RS, the "rs_cnf" parameter MUST NOT be used, since the client cannot
   determine for which RS the key applies.  This document recommends to
   specify a different endpoint that the client can use to acquire RS
   authentication keys in such cases.  The specification of such an
   endpoint is out of scope for this document.
