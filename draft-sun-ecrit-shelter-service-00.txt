Internet-Draft               Shelter Service                   July 2008


1.  Introduction

   It happens to announce shelter areas or locations before or after
   nature disasters occur.  A hill area could be declared as a shelter
   area for being safe from a flood threat.  LoST client can find out
   what instances of this service are closest to users.  Examples
   include earthquake shelter, flood shelter, air-raid shelter, wildfire
   etc.

   We introduce new services to find the safe areas near to a client's
   location.  And a LoST client can request for the particular service
   to know about the shelters near his location.  A user can go to any
   shelter and ask for help, normally the nearest is the best.  This is
   not like the police service, which has a clearly defined
   jurisdictional boundaries.  So it's always advised to search for a
   shelter near to a specified location.


2.  Terminology used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Sub-Services for the 'shelter' service

   This section defines the shelter service registration using the top-
   level service label 'shelter'.  This kind of service could be
   required in a wide range and in a short period.

           urn:service:shelter
           urn:service:shelter.airraid
           urn:service:shelter.earthquake
           urn:service:shelter.flood
           urn:service:shelter.heatwave
           urn:service:shelter.homeless
           urn:service:shelter.hurricane
           urn:service:shelter.wildfire

   Note: The corresponding description for each service will be added in
   the later version.


4.  Example for finding shelters

   In this example, we use the circular shape in queries and
   serviceLocation element in responses introduced by [LOST-EXT].  The

   <serviceLocation> element contains the geodetic coordinates of a
   point of service and must be contained in a <mapping> element.  In
   responses such as <findServiceResponse>, a list of service URIs, each
   with its own <serviceLocation> element, must be returned.

          </location>
          <service>urn:service:shelter.earthquake</service>
        </findService>

              Figure 1: A <findService> query


   The client is asking the LoST server to send a list of service URNs
   and earthquake shelter places within 2000.24 meters from its
   approximate position specified in <p2:pos>.

   It says that the given shelters specified by these service locations
   are safe area from earth quake.  In the same way he can request for
   other shelter services.
