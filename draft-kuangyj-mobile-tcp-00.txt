Abstract

   This document defines two types of IP addresses to support mobile TCP
   -  one  for  routing  and location  management,  the  other  for host
   identification.   Therefore,   the  dependency   of   TCP/UDP  socket
   identification upon the network layer is eliminated, and transmission
   sessions will  be no  longer dependent  of network  layer IP address,
   that is, location changes of a mobile host result only new network IP
   address, which has no  impact on transmission communications  and its
   continuity.

   And two new options  are designed for M-TCP  to hold IPv4, IPv6   and
   NAI  addresses; and  a new  protocol, M-UDP  is designed  to  support
   Transmission Control Layer host mobility.

1. Introduction and Motivation

   As known [1], IP version 4 (IPv4) even IPv6 assumes that a node's  IP
   address uniquely  identifies the  node's point  of attachment  to the
   Internet. Therefore, a node must be located on the network  indicated
   by  its IP  address in  order to  receive datagrams  destined to  it;
   otherwise, datagrams  destined to  the node  would be  undeliverable.
   When a node  needs to change  its point of  attachment without losing
   its  ability to  communicate, it  must typically:
   

   1) change   its  IP  address  whenever  it  changes  its   point  of
      attachment, or
   
   2) recur  to  host-specific   routing   scheme  -   in   which  route
      information     must      be   propagated       throughout    much
      of  the  Internet   routing   fabric    to  successfully   deliver
      packets   to   the     mobile     node.      Both     of     these
      alternatives   are  often unacceptable.  
   
   The first  makes it impossible for a node  to maintain transport  and
   higher-layer connections  when the node changes location. The  second
   has  obvious  and  severe   scaling  problems,   especially  relevant
   considering  the  explosive  growth  in  sales of  notebook (mobile)
   computers.

   Therefore,  new, scalable,  mechanism is  required for  accommodating
   node  mobility  within  the  Internet.  Currently,  there  are   many
   approaches to solve this  problem, such as Mobile  IP[1], HMMP[2][3],
   Mobile-TCP[4], ROAMIP[5], Cellular IP[6], etc. This draft describes a
   new  framework  to  support  host  mobility  in  TCP/IP  networks, by
   introducing  some modifications  in Transmission  layer to  make the
   TCP/IP stack more delaminated at the borderland between IP layer  and
   Transmission layer.

   In the section, we first briefly summarize the current works for host
   mobility  management  [1-6]  in  subsection  1.1.  In  the  following
   subsections 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6, we present assumptions upon  which
   the protocol  is based,  its applicability,  and terms  used in  this
   document. Then, a general description is given in subsection 1.7.

1.1. Related Works

   Thanks to  the vast  development of  microelectronics technology, our
   PDAs and/or mobile phones  become much more intelligent  and powerful
   as  they  become much  smaller  and easier  to  use, which  makes  us
   nowadays much more dependent upon the information network: Internet.

   To  access  into  Internet  at  whatever  time  and  anywhere,   many
   challenges must be faced, because IP architecture is not designed for

   moving freely.

1.1.1. Mobile IP [1]

   Mobile  IP  (MIP)  is  the most  famous  solution  to  introduce host
   mobility into Internet framework. RFC2002 introduces enhancements  to
   Internet Protocol that allow  transparent routing of IP  datagrams to
   mobile nodes in the Internet.  Mobile nodes are always identified  by
   their home addresses, regardless  of their access point  or locations
   where they  are attached  to the  Internet. When  they are  away from
   home, they must obtain temporary care-of-addresses - which are  valid
   with regard  to their  visited network  - and  register them to their
   home  agents.  In MIP  architecture,  the home  agents  intercept and
   capture datagrams destined for the  mobile node and then forward  the

   datagrams through tunnels (usually  IP-in-IP tunnels) to the  care-of
   address. At the end of the tunnel, each datagram is then delivered to
   the mobile nodes.

1.1.2. Mobility Support for TCP with SIP (HMMP) [2][3]

   Host mobility management protocol (HMMP) is a protocol for supporting
   real-time  and  non-real-time   multimedia  applications  on   mobile
   terminals  of  3G-IP  networks, which  utilizes  as  well as  extends
   session initiation protocol (SIP) to provide means of domain hand-off
   (i.e., roaming), and subnet  hand-off (i.e., macro mobility)  so that
   users can access the network from any location using their own mobile
   terminal. This protocol relies on An advantage of HMMP is that it can
   spoof  constant endpoints  for mobile  TCP connections  and  supports
   mobile TCP applications in a  SIP environment without any changes  to
   the TCP.

1.1.3. Mobile TCP [4]

   Mobile TCP  introduces an  asymmetric transport  protocol design  for
   mobile systems, where a  transport layer connection between  a mobile
   and  a   corresponding  stationary   host  is   partition  into   two
   connections, the connection between the mobile host and a local fixed
   host referred to  as Mobil e  Gateway and the  connection between the
   local fixed host and the corresponding host. In the first connection,
   TCP connection is an emulated  version by means of L2  link operation
   or  else  to reduce  computation  or other  processing  cost to  save
   battery power of a mobile terminal.

1.1.4. ROAMIP [5]

   ROAMIP is an architecture  that uses application layer  solutions for
   global  reachability  and  reuses  transparent  Mobile  IP  tunneling
   mechanisms  or  SIP  message formats  to  ensure  session continuity.

draft-kuangyj-mobile-tcp-00                                August 2004 


   ROAMIP eliminates long triangular  routes, yet it is  compatible with
   mobility unaware correspondent hosts. It is argued that it applicable
   to IPv6 as well as IPv4 networks.

1.1.5. Cellular IP [6]

   Cellular  IP defines  local and  wide area  mobility to  improve the
   performance of existing  mobile host protocols  (e.g. Mobile IP).  In
   Cellular IP, networks  are divided into  service domains where  local
   mobility  is  invisible  to  home  agents  -  Cellular  IP  maintains
   distributed cache for location management and routing purposes - thus
   reduces  frequent registration  messages or  binding updates  between
   home agents and the mobile host. In local visited domain, distributed
   paging cache coarsely maintains  the position of "idle"  mobile hosts
   in a service area, which are used to quickly and efficiently pinpoint
   "idle" mobile hosts that  wish to engage in  "active" communications.
   This approach is beneficial because it can accommodate a large number
   of users  attached to  the network  without overloading  the location
   management system.


1.2. Specification Language

   The keywords  "MUST", "MUST  NOT", "REQUIRED",  "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in  this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [8]

1.3. Assumptions

   Like  MIP,  this document  places  no additional  constraints  on the
   assignment of IP addresses. That is, a mobile node can be assigned an
   IP address by the organization that owns the machine.

   No  additional constraints  or modifications  are placed  on routers
   along the datagram path  during the communication between  the Mobile
   Host and Correspondent Host.

   The protocols  defined in  this document  focus interests  on unicast
   service only and support of  multicast services is for further  study
   (See Section 3).

   Moreover, the protocols described in this document are not assumed to
   implemented only in IPv4,  though examples or illustrations  for IPv4
   are given. IPv6 support is under further study.

   The protocols defined in this  document assume that each mobile  host
   may be  equipped with  more than  one network  interface, but each of
   them can own only one permanent IP address, though the protocols  are
   applicable for multiple permanent IP addresses.

draft-kuangyj-mobile-tcp-00                                August 2004 


   This  document  strictly assumes  that  the routers  are  reliable or
   credible, while the mechanism to  ensure reliability is out of  scope
   of this document.

1.4. Applicability and Goals

   The protocols aim at mobility  management for mobile hosts that  roam
   frequently resulting  frequent hand-offs  as well  as fixed  Internet
   nodes that occasionally change their attach point to Internet.

   The  protocols  defined here  are  suited for  both  "macro" mobility
   management and "micro" mobility management.

   In  the proposed  framework IP  network layer  is treated  as purely
   routing layer to  deliver datagrams to  where they are  destined. And
   the sessions created by  transmission control layer are  in principle
   independent of  the IP  layer below,  though IP  address is  still an
   indispensable element to ensure the  uniqueness of a socket, i.e.,  a
   session  between  processes  on  peer  hosts.  More  details  will be
   presented in "Protocol Overview" (Section 1.7) and Section 2.
   
   The proposal here aims to make transmission layer more independent of
   network layer, thus sessions will  not be broken when Internet  nodes
   changes  their  IP  addresses,  which  is  applicable  not  only   to

   intelligent mobile terminals, PDAs  etc, but also to  primarily fixed
   Internet nodes such as ponderous apparatus requiring Internet  access
   service all the time.

1.5. New Architectural Entities

   Actually,  no  new  architectural  entities  are  introduced  in this
   document.

   However, to  make it  easy to  state and  for comparison  purpose, we
   redefine some architectural entities in Mobile IP [1].

   Mobile Node (MN), or Mobile Host (MH)

      Mobile  Node  is  a  host or  router  that  changes  its point  of
      attachment from one  network  or  subnetwork to  another.  In  our
      architecture, a  mobile node  MUST has  two different  type of  IP
      addresses  (See   Section 1.7,   "Protocol   Overview"),  it   may
      change  the  temporary address  because of location change  or for
      other reasons even if it is  still on home  network, while  it may
      continue  to   communicate  with  other  Internet   nodes   at any
      location  using its  (constant)  IP address, assuming   link-layer
      connectivity  to  a  point   of  attachment   is available.  An MN
      CAN  deliver redirection messages by  ICMP datagrams or else.

draft-kuangyj-mobile-tcp-00                                August 2004 


   Native Router (NR)

      acts almost alike Home Agent (HA) in Mobile IP.

      A Home   Router is   a router   on a   mobile node's  home network
      which functions  like HA  in Mobile  IP, but  rather than  tunnels
      datagrams  in IP-in-IP  encapsulation it  just forwards  them  for
      delivery  to  the  mobile node  when it  is away  from home,  and
      maintains current location information for the mobile node.

   Foreign Router (FR)

      Foreign   Router  is  a   router  on   a   mobile   node's visited
      network (foreign  network) that provides  routing services to  the
      mobile node. An  FR  here  is  not the same   as Foreign Agent  in
      Mobile IP because it  MAY have   no capacity  to  handle  IP-in-IP
      packets.  Moreover,    an  FR    MUST   have  functionalities   to
      handle  ICMP messages  generated  by  MH   in  order  to  delivery
      subsequent datagrams  destined  to  MH  correctly.  For  datagrams
      sent  by a mobile node, the foreign agent may serve as  a  default
      router  for registered mobile nodes.

1.6. Terminology

   This document frequently uses the following terms:

   Permanent Address, PA


      An  identification of the Mobile Host.  The prefix of PA  MUST  be
      the  same as  that  of  its home   network. In  the document,  its
      alias,  Home Address may be used frequently.

   Unique Network Identifier, UNI, or Network Access Identifier, NAI

      A globally  unique identifier  used to  locate an  Internet node's
      home network or user's service agent, usually in USER@DOMAIN  form
      [9][10].

   Dynamic Address (DA), or Temporary Address (TA).

      Each   node  in   our  architecture   MUST  obtain   manually  or
      automatically by  some auto-configuration  protocol an  IP address
      valid to  its attached  network even  at home  network. TA plays a
      similar  role  of  Care-of-Address  in  Mobile  IP,  but  in quite
      different manner.

   Redirect ICMP Message (RMSG),

      An existing  ICMP message  or some  extended versions  of existing

draft-kuangyj-mobile-tcp-00                                August 2004 


      ICMP  message  used to  tell  the router  (HR  or FR)  to  deliver
      messages  to a new location, i.e., a new TA.

   Agent Advertisement

      An  advertisement  message  constructed  by  attaching  a  special
      Extension to a router advertisement [11] message.

   Correspondent Node (CH) or Correspondent Host (CH)

      A peer with which a mobile node is communicating. A  correspondent
      node may be either mobile or stationary.

   Foreign Network (FN)

      Any network  other than  the mobile  node's Home  Network. In this
      document, its alias Visited Network may be frequently used.

   Native Network (NN) or Home Network (HN)

      A network, possibly virtual, having a network prefix matching that
      of a  mobile node's  home address.  Note that  standard IP routing
      mechanisms  will deliver  datagrams destined  to a  mobile node's
      Native Address to the mobile node's Native Network.

   Link

      A facility or medium over which nodes can communicate at the  link
      layer. A link underlies the network layer.


   Link-Layer Address

      The address  used to  identify an  endpoint of  some communication
      over  a physical  link. Typically,  the Link-Layer  address is  an
      interface's Media Access Control (MAC) address.

   Node is a host or a router.

   Nonce 
   
      is  a  randomly  chosen value,  different  from  previous choices,
      inserted in a message to protect against replays.

   Security Parameter Index (SPI)

      An index identifying  a security context  between a pair  of nodes
      among  the  contexts   available  during  the   Mobility  Security
      Association between the MH and its NR.

draft-kuangyj-mobile-tcp-00                                August 2004 


   Redirection Nodes Table (RNT)

      A  database  or  table  on  the   NR  with   mobility   management
      information, for example,  about which TA  is associated with  its
      MH.

   Visitor List

      A database on  one of the  foreign routers on  the visited network
      for management purpose, which contains  at least a list of  mobile
      nodes visiting a foreign agent.

   Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

      refers to both TCP and UDP in this document except for cases where
      clearly declared to mean pure TCP.

   Mobile-TCP (MTCP)

      is extended transmission layer protocol defined in this  document,
      which  supports transmission  layer mobility  over traditional  IP
      layer.  In  this   document,  M-TCP  is   used  to  refer   mobile
      transmission  control  protocol  only and  M-UDP  for  mobile user
      datagram protocol only.

   MTCP message

      refers to transmission  layer message or  payload of IP  datagrams
      compatible with MTCP.

   Mobile-TCP compatible Node (MTN)

      is  a node  that implements  necessary protocols  defined by  this
      document.


   Scheme A

      refers implementation  of M-TCP  by extending  traditional TCP  to
      include PA information (see Section 2.1.1).

   Scheme B

      refers implementation  of M-TCP  by adding  a new  TCP protocol to
      TCP/IP stack (see Section 2.1.2).

   Non-Triangle Mode

      refers to an operation mode when the CH knows where the MH locates

      and  sends data  directly to  its current  TA, which  involves no
      triangular route.

1.7. Protocol Overview

1.7.1. References Network Model

   In the proposed architecture, we introduces some modifications to the
   existing  TCP/IP  stack  to  make  Transmission  Control  Layer  more
   independent  from  Internet  Protocol  Layer,  thus  an  MTN  MUST be
   configured with two IP addresses.

   One is Permanent Address (PA), or called Home Address. The PA resides
   on the transmission layer, which can be passed down to network  layer
   for particular purpose.  The permanent address  may be configured  as
   home  network  compatible  IP  address  or  even  a  unique   network
   identifier - it is up to  transmission layer to interpret the PA  and
   associate  to  sockets  for communication  session.  Only  IP address
   format is considered  in this document,  and the PA  is carried along
   with the TCP payload as an option.

   The  other is  Dynamic Address  (DA), or  Temporary Address  (TA). A
   node's TA can be obtained from a DHCP server (which is usually on the
   attached network) or manually configured. TA functions quite like the
   traditional IP  address used  to route  datagrams and  to locate  the
   Mobile Node, but is no longer a tag associated to a session, which is
   represented by a socket.  However, it may have  the same value of  PA
   when PA is an IP address and the MH is on the home network.

   Figure  1  illustrates  the   new  network  model  of   the  proposed
   architecture.

1.7.2. Protocol Overview

   Based on above reference model we defined:

   1) Two schemes for M-TCP

      a) Two new TCP options to upgrade TCP to M-TCP, and

      b) A new TCP protocol: M-TCP, and

   2) A new UDP protocol: M-UDP.

   In M-TCP and M-UDP, three kinds of permanent address can be used  for
   transmission control layer session identification, IPv4, IPv6 and NAI
   addresses that are  independent of network  layer address, which  are
   dynamic even when the MH is on home network. By contrast, the network
   address is  used only  for location  management and  datagram routing
   function by router to deliver datagrams correctly.

   In the proposed architecture, changes of network addresses result  no
   impaction on its upper layer function.

   Therefore, the transmission control layer is mobile in nature,  which
   means that  no IP-in-IP  tunneling needed,  routers remain  unchanged
   except that they are mobile as mobile nodes. Moreover, IPv4 and  IPv6
   nodes are essentially compatible on the TCP layer. By introducing NAI
   in identification of TCP layer sessions, some high-level services can
   be supported by transmission layer such as per-bill tolling.

1.7.3. Sockets and Addressing

1.7.3.1. Definition of Sockets

   In TCP/IP  stack, a  socket is  a unique  identifier for  a TCP layer
   conversation. There are five distinct elements that make a TCP  layer
   connection unique:

      IP address of the server

      IP address of the client

      Port number of the server

      Port number of the client

      Protocol (UDP, TCP/IP, etc...)


   In our proposed  MTCP, a socket  is also a  combination of the  above



Kuang, Long, Chen, Li    Expires: February 2005                [Page 11]

draft-kuangyj-mobile-tcp-00                                August 2004 


   five elements, i.e.,

      <socket>  :=  <protocol,  local  address,  local  process, foreign
                     address, foreign process>.

   For half  associations, a  socket address  is the  triple: {protocol,
   local-address, local-process}, often  referring to service  interface
   on a server, i.e.,

      <half-socket> := <protocol, local address, local process>.

   The address in above mentioned socket identifier should be  permanent
   address that is  the only notation  for identity of  the host or  the
   node.

1.7.3.2. Addressing

   Both PA and  TA can be  configured manually or  by auto-configuration
   mechanism such as DHCP. However, they reside on different layers with
   different function.

   In  our  architecture, PA  and  TA may  belong  to different  address
   family.  And  for  auto-configuration  progress,  the   configuration
   servers may or may not reside on the same host/node.

   Particularly  for  NAI  address,  the  process  to  map  NAI  to  its
   associated permanent and/or temporary address may be complicated, but
   it  should be  kept intact  in the  TCP/UDP header  for reasons  not
   mentioned in  this text,  or it  should use  its associated permanent
   address unless the account information is configured not to so.

   When a CH needs to communicate  with a MH, it destined its  datagrams
   to the MH's home address. The  home agent or native router of  the MH
   intercepts the  datagrams destined  to MH,  and redirects  to MH's TA
   where MH is. And the proposal makes it possible for MH to tell CH its
   present TA by replacing the source address field with its current TA,
   which  may be  useful to  eliminate triangle  routes -  but this  is
   prohibited when the TA  is changed at the  same time, because it  may
   confuse the receiver and announce an error and abort this connection.

   When a MH needs to communicate with a CH, it can decide to use either
   PA or  TA as  source address.  Actually, when  TA is  used as  source
   address, the triangle routing issue will not occur.

   Security issues involved in the above addressing mechanism are  under
   further consideration. However, some authentication means are already
   available.

2. Mobile Transmission Control Protocol (MTCP)

2.1. Mobile TCP

2.1.1. Scheme A

   In scheme A, M-TCP  is implemented as an  extended version of TCP  by
   introducing new options  to TCP header  format. However, because  UDP
   header  is  not extendable,  so  a new  UDP  header is  designed  and
   assigned a new value for the protocol field of the IP header.

   Basically, the TCP  header format remains  unchanged (see Figure  2),
   and the protocol value in IP header remains as 06 (HEX).

   But two new  options must be  introduced to carry  source address and
   destination  address in  the TCP  header. Moreover,  in the  new TCP
   header, the calculation of checksum MUST not be based upon the pseudo
   header,  because  the  source  address  and  destination  address are
   already included in the M-TCP header.

   Although, the  TCP header  seems overstaffed,  at most  16 bytes  are
   introduced  for  IPv4  -  which   is  less  than  that  by   IP-in-IP
   encapsulation in Mobile IP [1].

2.1.1.1. Options for Mobile TCP

   The new options MUST be compatible for three cases:
   
   1) PA is in  IPv4 address format; 
   
   2) PA is in  IPv6 address format; 

   
   3) PA is  in  NAI format. Therefore,  we have  designed two  types of
      options in  type -length-value (TLV) format.

   The first one  is used for  source permanent address;  the second  is
   used for destination permanent address. The format is show in  Figure
   3 and Figure 4. Either one goes first is of no importance.

   The option length is variable, and its value depends on the type   of
   address chosen.

   The address type  can be one  of the following  three values;  others
   are reserved for further study:

      <Address-Type>   := 1; for IPv4 address.

                       := 2; for IPv6 address.

                       := 3; for NAI address.

   The address length can be  determined according to the address   type
   in octets, but for  NAI addresses, it stands  for the length of   the
   NAI ASCII string, and may be variable:

      <Address-Length> := 4; for IPv4 address.

                       := 16; for IPv6 address.

                       := Variable; for NAI address.

   The length of the padding bits  used to make the header size   32-bit
   aligned is calculated as:

      <Padding-Length> := Ceil(Option-Length/4) * 4 - Option-Length

   "Ceil  (value)"  rounds  <value>  to  the  nearest  integers  towards
   infinity.

   By convention, the Most Significant Bit of the permanent address   is
   sent first, i.e., in MSB first sequences.

draft-kuangyj-mobile-tcp-00                                August 2004 


   The address length for IPv4 and IPv6 address can be zero to tell  the
   receiver  to infer  it from   network layer,  but this  mode  is  not
   support yet for NAI address.

   When  M-TCP is  assumed, at   least one  of defined  option  must  be
   included. However, for  both options, the  permanent address may   be
   not present by setting address length to zeros - When this is   true,
   the transmission control layer should use the corresponding   network
   layer address, in which case NAI addresses will not be supported.

   Like that in TCP, when either  of both addresses can be absent,   but
   the address length  must be present  and set to  zero. When this   is
   true,  the receiver  should  obtain  the corresponding  address  from
   network  layer. But  for the  checksum calculation,  the pseudo   TCP
   header is not used for  the addresses are already included  in M-TCP
   header.

   Moreover,  when  NAI  address  (for  either  source  or   destination
   address) is used, proper length  of padding octets must be  added  to
   make address body with 32-bit length, though the padding octets  will
   not be included in the address length calculation.

   Note that  the most  significant bit  of the  address is sent  first,
   i.e., in MSB first sequences.

2.2. Mobile UDP

   Since  UDP header  cannot be   extended to  hold source  address  and
   destination address, a  new UDP format  must be designed  with a  new
   protocol value (to be specified by IANA) in IP header.

   Figure  6 illustrates  the new   UDP header  format. The  source  and
   destination permanent address type and length are piggybacked to  the
   original  UDP  header,  and  then  follow  the  source  address   and
   destination address.

   the address length  must be present  and set to  zero. When this   is
   true,  the receiver  should  obtain  the corresponding  address  from
   network layer.

   Moreover,  when  NAI  address  (for  either  source  or   destination
   address) is used, proper length  of padding octets must be  added  to
   make address body with 32-bit length, though the padding octets will
   not be included in the address length calculation.

2.3. Redirect ICMP Message (RMSG)

   When an MH is attached to a  network - whether it is home network  or
   foreign network -  the MH may  change its temporary  address (TA). If
   so, it is  MH that is  responsible to inform  the router that  it has
   changed its (TA).  We call it  a Redirection Operation.  The redirect
   message in RFC792 is  not suitable for our  case, for it is  designed
   for gateway use  only, a non-router  node is not  assumed to generate
   that message.

   Here, we design  a new ICMPv4  redirection - that  for IPv6 is  under
   further discussion - for this purpose. See Figure 7.

      attached; others reserved.

   Checksum.

      The   checksum  is   the 16-bit   1's  complement   of the   one's
      complement sum of the ICMP  message starting with the ICMP   Type.
      For  computing the   checksum ,   the checksum   field should   be
      zero.  This checksum may be replaced in the future.

   Old TA and New TA.

      When MH moves to a new  location associated with  a new TA  or  it
      changes its  TA by any  method, the old  TA and new  TA should  be
      included here.

   Authentication Options.

      The authentication option may be used for ICMP integrity  checking
      and authentication  purpose   against  cheating  or   faking.  The
      actual  operation  is out  of  scope of  this  document and  under
      further study.

   Internet Header + 64 bits of Data Datagram

      is the  Internet header  plus the  first 64  bits of  the original
      datagram's data, which is used by the host to match the message to
      the  appropriate process.  If a  higher-level protocol  uses port

      numbers, they are assumed to be  in the first 64 data bits  of the
      original datagram's data.

   Description.

      When the MH's TA is changed,  it should use this message to  alert
      the router on  the previous network  the old TA  belongs informing
      that all  following datagrams  destined to  the old  TA should  be
      diverted  to the  new TA.  If the  message is  proved valid,  the
      destined router unconditionally accepts the redirection command to
      following  datagrams for  MH. At  the same  time, the  MH sends  a
      similar redirection  command to  its home  router, but  the old TA
      will be replaced by its  home PA. This functions like  a rebinding
      operation. Additionally, when in non-triangular mode, the MH sends
      the ICMP redirection command to the CH too.

   For safety, multiple redirections  should be sent against  failure of
   packet  losses.  The  routers   or  CH  shall  drop   the  subsequent
   redirection quietly, when a  successful redirection is received.  The
   interval between successive redirection is implementation  dependent,
   but should be adaptable to the traffic status.

2.4. Requirements for Mobile Hosts

   A MH may fall into two types of mobile nodes:

   1) MN to be addressed by  CHs according to its known address  and its
      Home address is permanent  in form of IPv4,  IPv6 or NAI  address.
      In this case the MH MAY work  as  a server known to some CHs.   We
      call it is a PASSIVE host.

   2) MH never to be addressed by others and always acts as a client  to
      initiate  conversions.  Its  home  address   may  or  may  not  be
      permanent; it may be  configured by dynamic IP  assignment schemes
      or manually. We call it an ACTIVE host.

   At the same time, a MH may be in two statuses when it is changing its
   TA whether at home or abroad:

   1) It maintains at least one communication session active with one or
      more CHs. We call it is talking.

   2) No active communication session or connection involved. We call it
      is quiet.

   The term "communication" here means an active connection or a running
   TCP/UDP process bound  to a port  number, whether or  not data stream
   transferring through it.

   For an active host, when it is quiet, it changes TA quietly,  without
   informing the foreign router or native router; when it is talking, it
   should inform  the previously  attached router  and the corresponding
   host to update its new TA.


   For a passive host,  when it is quiet,  it should inform the  foreign
   router and its home router about  new TA; when it is talking,  it may
   also inform the CH if non-triangular mode is set.

   When MH is powered on and configured with permanent home address,  it
   should obtain its TA by DHCP  or manually, and report it to  its home
   router regardless of whether it is at home or abroad by send redirect
   message to its home router.

   For  more  reliable  binding of  TA  with  PA, an  MH  may  send RMSG
   periodically or  it can  use Mobile  IP registration  messages if the
   router supports Mobile IP. However, interoperation of M-TCP with  MIP
   needs further study.

2.5. Requirements for Correspondent Hosts

   If CH is mobile TCP compatible, it should work as MH described above.

   If not, that is CH  cannot understand Mobile TCP headers  or options,
   it  should report  error to  the MH  when it  decides to  reject the
   connection requests.

   When an MH  decides to make  its location known  to one of  its CH it
   should send more than one redirection command messages to the CH, and
   the CH should drop redundant redirections quietly.

   And  if  it   cannot  handle  the   redirection  messages  from   its
   corresponding MH it should drop it quietly.

2.6. Requirements for Routers

   Routers on the  native network should  be able to  handle redirection
   messages and maintain a redirection nodes table (RNT). The RNT may be
   a part of routing table or a routing cache.

   When an NR received a valid RMSG from a MH wherever it is, it  should
   update the corresponding entry.

   When an NR receives  a datagram destined to  a node belonging to  its
   domain, it simply searches  the NR. If there  is a matched entry,  it
   forwards it to the TA of that entry.

   If there is more than one native router on the same domain, it is the
   native routers' responsibility to share the NR information; therefore
   home agent discovery in MIP is not necessary in this architecture.

2.7. Route Optimization Consideration

   In the proposed  architecture, any route  optimization scheme may  be
   used, because the network layer remains hardly touched.

   Moreover,  the  MH takes  the  responsibility to  share  its location
   information with its CHs. When it is necessary to use  non-triangular

   mode for route optimization  purpose, it may send  RMSG to CH, or  it
   may  replace  the source  PA  in TCP/UDP  header  to tell  the  CH to
   directly send datagrams to that TA.

3. Multicast Support

   Multicast support in foreign domains  is left for further study,  but
   current multicast  solicitation and  association schemes  can be used
   without or with little changes.

4. Security Consideration

   The proposed architecture  may have security  problems as Mobile  IP
   - whose  solution may  or may  not be  the same  - and other security
   issues under further study. Any  problem or solution found will  make
   part of the following updates.

5. Conclusion

   This  document  proposes  a  framework  to  implement  mobile  TCP by
   introducing two  type of  IP address  - one  for routing and location
   management,  the  other for  host  identification, thus  transmission
   sessions will no  longer dependent of  network layer IP  address, and
   location changes of a mobile host result only new network IP address,
   which  has   no  impact   on  transmission   communications  and  its
   continuity. The new architecture involves no IP-in-IP tunneling,  and
   no  changes  on  intermediate routers;  it  is  almost an  End-to-End
   solution to  implement host  mobility management,  and applicable for
   both "macro-" and "micro-" mobility.

   Then two new options  are designed for M-TCP  to hold IPv4, IPv6  and
   NAI  addresses; and  a new  protocol, M-UDP  is designed  to support
   Transmission Control Layer host mobility. Both the designed M-TCP and
   M-UDP are IPv4 and IPv6 compatible and extensible.

   For future high-level host  or personal mobility management,  NAI may
   also be used  to support M-TCP,  which benefits much  easier mobility
   management and per-bill services and so on.
