Abstract 
         
   The purpose of the Incident Object Description and Exchange Format is
   to define a common data format for describing and exchanging incident
   information between collaborating Computer Security Incident Response
   Teams (CSIRTs). The specific goals and requirements of the IODEF are
   described in [2]. One of the design principles in the IODEF is
   compatibility with the Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format
   (IDMEF) [3] developed for intrusion detection systems. For this
   reason, IODEF is heavily based on the IDMEF and provides upward
   compatibility with it.

1. Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST," "MUST NOT," "REQUIRED," "SHALL," "SHALL NOT,"
   "SHOULD," "SHOULD NOT," "RECOMMENDED," "MAY," and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2].

   Network and Computer Security related terminology used in this
   documents is of common use, however it contains some specific
   conventions described in [2] and [4].


2. Introduction

   The Incident Object Description and Exchange Format (IODEF) is
   a format for Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) to
   exchange operational and statistical incident information among
   themselves, their constituency, and their collaborators.  It can
   also provide the basis for the development of interoperable tools
   and procedures for incident reporting.

   By using the IODEF in their workflow and incident handling system, an
   organization can benefit from:

   +  a single data schema that can represent information from a
      variety of subordinate teams or CSIRTs;

   +  a common incident data format that facilities collaboration among
      affected members of the security community  (e.g. users, vendors,
      response teams, law enforcement);



Meijer, et al.            Expires March 2003                    [page 4]

Internet Draft         draft-ietf-inch-iodef-00.txt             Apr 2002




   +  the simplification in building an incident correlation and
      statistics system that process incident reports from different
      CSIRTs.

   The computer security related terminology used in this document is
   described in [1] and [4]. Specific terminology, notation, and
   conventions of the data model and XML DTD are presented in
   Sections 3 and 4.  The data model is described in Section 5 with
   examples of its use in Section 8.  Recognizing the potentially
   diverse user-base implementing the IODEF, Section 6 discusses the
   ability to extend the model.



   2.1 IODEF Data Model Design principles

      The IODEF data model is an object-oriented representation of
      information reported and maintained by a CSIRT about a computer
      security incident.


      2.1.1 Problems Addressed by the Data Model

         The data model addresses several problems in representing
         incident data:

         +  Incident data is inherently heterogeneous. It may encompass
            many functional purposes such as a description of intruder
            behavior or an analysis process correlating related
            incidents.  However, even in a single type of incident,
            seemingly disparate information from many sources may need
            to be represented.

            This representation of the data is further complicated by
            the fact that incidents may consist of varying levels of
            detail depending on their stage in the lifecycle.  For
            example, newly reported incidents may only contain a short
            description of the involved parties.  On the other hand,
            closed incidents can contain a full description complete
            with the associated evidence and annotation of actions taken
            by the CSIRT. The data model that represents this
            information must be flexible to accommodate different needs.

            An object-oriented model provides extensible via aggregation
            and sub-classing while preserving the consistency of the
            model.  If the data model required modification, it is
            extended with new classes.  In implementations that do not
            recognize these extensions, the basic subset of the data



Meijer, et al.            Expires March 2003                    [page 5]

Internet Draft         draft-ietf-inch-iodef-00.txt             Apr 2002



            model will still be understood.

            In order to address the various types of incidents, the
            IODEF data model creates top-level classes for each of the
            different incident profiles. Just as another other
            extensions to the data model, creating new profiles is
            possible through sub-classing or aggregation based on the
            core and supportive classes.

         +  From the purview of a CSIRT, incident information can
            originate from a number of sources.

            The data model defines support classes that accommodate the
            differences between incident reporters. This support
            includes various meta information to represent the
            reporter's identity as well as prescribe a confidence level
            to the submitted information.

         +  Incidents may contain sensitive information. Such
            information should not be exposed to unauthorized parties
            during collaboration.

            The data model allows for a highly granular level of tagging
            in the individual classes to indication restrictions on the
            usage of the data.  However, it is the role of the incident
            handling system implementing the data model to honor these
            labels.


      2.1.2 Data Model Design Goals

         In addition to satisfying the explicit requirements found in
         RFCXXX [2], the IODEF data model is designed with the following
         goals:

         +  The data model is content-driven. This design dictates
            that new representations are introduced only to accommodate
            new types of data, not semantic differences between
            incidents.

         +  Since organizations may define an incident in different
            ways, the data model avoids implicitly relying on a single
            definition of an incident. Rather, it is designed to be
            flexible enough to accomodate a range of understandings in
            what constitutes incident activity.

         +  Where security-related, XML work already exist (e.g., IDMEF
            [3]), the data model will provide support for them.

   2.2 Using XML for the IODEF

      The IODEF implementation is based on the Extensible Markup
      Language (XML). XML-based applications define their own XML DTD or
      Schema and register a specific XML namespace [6]. The IODEF
      conforms to the IETF-defined procedure for registering an
      application-specific XML namespace [9].

      NOTE: For clarity in this document, we will use the terms "XML"
            and "XML documents" when speaking in the general case about
            the Extensible Markup Language (XML).  The terms "IODEF
            description", "IODEF markup" and "IODEF  document" will be
            used to refer to specific elements (tags) and attributes of
            the IODEF DTD.  Furthermore, the terms "class" and
            "subclass" are synonymous to an element in the XML DTD.

      The implementation of the IODEF in XML has many benefits:

      +  XML provides all the necessary features to define a specific
         markup language for describing security incidents. It also
         defines a standard way to extend this language, either for
         later revisions ("standard" extensions), or for vendor-specific
         use ("non-standard" extensions).

      +  Software tools for processing XML documents are widely
         available in commercial and open source forms.

      +  XML can provide support for full internationalization and
         localization since it is required (and therefore IODEF
         documents are required) to support both the UTF-8 and UTF-16
         encodings of ISO/IEC 10646 (Universal Multiple-Octet Coded
         Character Set, "UCS") and Unicode.

         XML also provides support for specifying, on a per-element
         basis, the language in which the element's content is written,
         making the IODEF easy to adapt to the local languages in which
         a CSIRTs operates.

      +  XML coupled with XSL, a style language, allows IODEF documents
         to be aggregated, filtered, discarded, and rearranged.

      +  XML is free (no license, license fees or royalties).


   2.3 Relationship between the IODEF and the IDMEF

      The IODEF and the IDMEF [3] are complementary formats.  The latter
      represents data generated by an intrusion detection system.  Such



Meijer, et al.            Expires March 2003                    [page 7]

Internet Draft         draft-ietf-inch-iodef-00.txt             Apr 2002



      event data is commonly used by a CSIRT as the basis for an
      incident report or investigation which is represented by the
      IODEF.

      The IODEF data model makes use of certain classes defined in the
      IDMEF, although the semantics of some of these classes has
      changed.  Due to their related nature, the data in an IDMEF
      message can be easily represented in an IODEF document.  Through
      various extension mechanisms, it is possible to include IDMEF
      messages outright in an IODEF document.  Alternatively, the
      similarity in structure of the data model makes it possible to
      decompose the key IDMEF data and include it in the corresponding
      IODEF classes.  However, this transformation may not preserve the
      original semantics of the data.



3. Notational Conventions and Formatting Issues

   This document uses three notations: the Unified Modeling Language
   (UML) to describe the data model, an Extensible Markup Language
   (XML) Document Type Definition (DTD) to define the IODEF syntax, and
   IODEF XML markup conforming to the specified DTD to represent the
   incident data.

   This section briefly introduces these notations, and explains
   particular issues related to using them to describe the IODEF data
   model and syntax.  For readers unfamiliar with these notations,
   [3] and [10] will provide a comprehensive reference.


   3.1 Unified Modeling Language conventions used for IODEF Data Model
       description

      The IODEF data model is described using the Unified Modeling
      Language (UML) [10]. UML provides a simple framework to represent
      entities and their relationships. UML defines entities as classes.
      In this document, we have identified several classes and their
      associated attributes.  The symbols used in this document to
      represent classes and attributes are shown in Figure 3.1.


      +-------------+
      | Class Name  |     <----- Name of class
      +-------------+
      | Attribute 1 |     <----- Name of first attribute
      | ...         |
      | Attribute N |     <----- Name of nth attribute
      +-------------+

      Figure 3.1 - Symbols representing classes and attributes

      Note that the associated attributes for a class may not appear in
      all diagrams in which the class is used.


      3.1.1 Relationships

         The IODEF model uses only two of the UML relationship types:
         inheritance and aggregation.

         Inheritance denotes a superclass/subclass type of relationship
         where the subclass inherits all the attributes, operations, and
         relationships of the superclass.  Subclasses may have
         additional attributes or operations that apply only to the
         subclass, and not to the superclass.

         In this document, inheritance is denoted by the /_\ symbol. In
         Figure 3.2, we are showing that Book and Magazine are two types
         of Publication.  Book inherits all the attributes of
         Publication, plus all of its own attributes (thus, it has four
         attributes in total); as does Magazine (giving it three
         attributes in total).

                | Publication |
                +-------------+

      3.1.2 Occurrence Indicators

         Occurrence indicators show the number of objects within a class
         that are linked to one another by an aggregation relationship.
         They are placed at the end of the association line closest to
         the part they refer to.  Occurrence indicators, as used in this
         document, are:

            n   exactly "n" (left blank if n=1)
         0..*   (in XML, *) zero or more
         1..*   (in XML, +) one or more
         0..1   (in XML, ?) zero or one
         n..m   between "n" and "m" inclusive

   3.2 XML Document Type Definitions

      XML Document Type Definitions (DTDs) are used to declare the
      syntax or markup for the IODEF.

      The different pieces of information the XML document will
      contain are elements, the characteristics of that information
      are the attributes, and the relationship between the information
      is the content model.

      Section 8 of this document contains the complete IODEF DTD.


   3.3 XML Documents

      This section describes a number of XML document formatting rules;
      these rules apply to IODEF documents as well.


      3.3.1 The Document Prolog

         The "prolog" of an XML document, that part that precedes
         anything else, consists of the XML declaration and the document
         type declaration.


         3.3.1.1 XML Declaration

            Every XML document (and therefore every IODEF document)
            starts with an XML declaration.  The XML declaration
            specifies the version of XML being used; it may also specify
            the character encoding being used.

            The XML declaration looks like:

            <?xml version="1.0" ?>

            If a character encoding is specified, the declaration looks
            like:

            <?xml version="1.0" encoding="charset" ?>

            where "charset" is the name of the character encoding in use
            (see Section 3.3.2).  If no encoding is specified, UTF-8 is
            assumed.  IODEF documents being exchanged between



Meijer, et al.            Expires March 2003                   [page 11]

Internet Draft         draft-ietf-inch-iodef-00.txt             Apr 2002



            IODEF-compliant applications MUST begin with an XML
            declaration, and MUST specify the XML version in use.
            Specification of the encoding in use is RECOMMENDED.

            IODEF-compliant applications MAY choose to omit the XML
            declaration internally to conserve space, adding it only
            when the message is sent to another destination (e.g., a web
            browser).  This practice is NOT RECOMMENDED unless it can be
            accomplished without loss of each message's version and
            encoding information.


         3.3.1.2 IODEF DTD Formal Public Identifier

            The formal public identifier (FPI) for the IODEF Document
            Type Definition described in this document is:

            "-//IETF//DTD RFCxxxx IODEF v0.0//EN"

            NOTE: The "RFCxxxx" text in the FPI value will be replaced
            with the actual RFC number, if this document is published as
            an RFC.

            This FPI MUST be used in the document type declaration
            within an XML document referencing the IODEF DTD defined by
            this document, as shown in the following section.


         3.3.1.3 IODEF DTD Document Type Declaration

            The document type declaration for an XML document
            referencing the IODEF DTD will usually be specified in the
            following ways:

            <!DOCTYPE IODEF-Description PUBLIC
               "-//IETF//DTD RFCxxxx IODEF v0.0//EN">

            The last component of the document type declaration is the
            FPI specified in the previous section.

            <!DOCTYPE IODEF-Description SYSTEM
               "/some/path/to/the/IODEF-Description.dtd">

            The last component of the document type declaration is a URI
            that points to a copy of the Document Type Definition.

            In order to be valid (see Section 7.1), an XML document must
            contain a document type declaration.  However, this
            requirement imposes a significant overhead on an

Internet Draft         draft-ietf-inch-iodef-00.txt             Apr 2002



            IODEF-compliant application in bandwidth consumption and
            computation for the DTD may need to be downloaded and parsed
            before use by the XML parser.

            Implementers MAY decide to have entities who regularly
            exchange IODEF message agree out-of-band on the particular
            document type definition they will be using to exchange
            messages (the standard one as defined here, or one with
            extensions), and then omit it from IODEF documents.
            However, the method for negotiating this agreement is
            outside the scope of this document.

            NOTE: Care must be taken in negotiating any such agreements,
                  as each entities will have to keep state on this
                  agreed upon document type definition.  The management
                  complexity of these negotiations grows more complex as
                  entities make such arrangements with many
                  collaborators.


      3.3.2 Character Data Processing in XML and IODEF

         A document's XML declaration specifies
         the character encoding to be used in the document, as follows:

         <?xml version="1.0" encoding="charset" ?>

         where "charset" is the name of the character encoding, as
         registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA),
         see [11].

         The XML standard requires that XML processors support the UTF-8
         and UTF-16 encodings of ISO/IEC 10646 (UCS) and Unicode, making
         all XML applications (and therefore, all IODEF-compliant
         applications) compatible with these common character encodings.

         While XML supports other character encodings (e.g., UTF-7,
         UTF-32), for portability reasons, IODEF documents SHOULD NOT be
         encoded in character encodings other than UTF-8 and UTF-16.

         Consistent with the XML standard, if no encoding is specified
         for an IODEF document, UTF-8 is assumed.  Likewise, IODEF
         documents encoded in UTF-16 MUST begin with the Byte Order Mark
         described by ISO/IEC 10646 Annex E and Unicode Appendix B (the
         "ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE" character, #xFEFF).


         3.3.2.1 Character Entity References




Meijer, et al.            Expires March 2003                   [page 13]

Internet Draft         draft-ietf-inch-iodef-00.txt             Apr 2002



            Within XML documents, certain characters have special
            meanings in some contexts.  To include the actual character
            itself in one of these contexts, a special escape sequence,
            called an entity reference, must be used.

            The characters that sometimes need to be escaped, and their
            entity references, are:

            Character        Entity Reference
            ---------------------------------
            &                 &amp;
            <                 &lt;
            >                 &gt;
            "                 &quot;
            '                 &apos;

            It is RECOMMENDED that IODEF-compliant applications use the
            entity reference form whenever writing these characters in
            data, to avoid any possibility of misinterpretation.


         3.3.2.2 Character Code References

            Any character defined by the ISO/IEC 10646 and Unicode
            standards may be included in an XML document by the use of a
            character reference. A character reference is started with
            the characters '&' and '#', and ended with the character
            ';'.  Between these characters, the character code for the
            character inserted.

            If the character code is preceded by an 'x' it is
            interpreted in hexadecimal (base 16), otherwise, it is
            interpreted in decimal (base 10).  For instance, the
            ampersand (&) is encoded as &#38; or &#x0026; and the
            less-than sign (<) is encoded as &#60; or &#x003C;.

            Any one-, two-, or four-byte character specified in the
            ISO/IEC 10646 and Unicode standards can be included in a
            document using this technique.


         3.3.2.3 White Space Processing

            All IODEF elements support the "xml:space" attribute.

            If "xml:space" is set to "preserve," the IODEF application
            MUST treat all white space in the element's content as
            significant.  If "xml:space" is "default," the application
            is free to do whatever it normally would with white space



Meijer, et al.            Expires March 2003                   [page 14]

Internet Draft         draft-ietf-inch-iodef-00.txt             Apr 2002



            in the element's content.


      3.3.3 Languages in XML and IODEF

         All IODEF tags support the "xml:lang" attribute whereby
         allowing each element to identify the language in which its
         content is.  The valid language code for the "xml:lang"
         attribute are described in RFC 3066 [12].

         IODEF documents SHOULD specify the language in which
         their contents are encoded. In general, the language can
         be specified with the "xml:lang" attribute in the top-level
         element and letting all other elements "inherit" that
         definition.

         If no language is specified in an IODEF document, English
         SHALL be assumed.



      3.3.4 Inheritance and Aggregation

         XML DTDs do not support inheritance as used by the IODEF data
         model. This limitation does not present a major problem in
         practice because aggregation relationships can be used instead
         with little loss of functionality.

         As a note of interest, XML Schemas, recently approved by the
         W3C, will provide support for inheritance, stronger data typing
         and other useful features [7]. Future versions of the IODEF
         will probably use XML Schemas instead of DTDs. It was
         recognized that in the initial stage of the design of a new
         application, an XML DTD was useful since it provides a better
         human readable format for document and element descriptions.
         However, with further the development of applications and
         integration into IH systems a more detailed definition of data
         types and elements relations as provided by XML Schemas may be
         required.


   3.4 IODEF Data Types

            XML DTDs do not support data types such as integer, real,
            string, and so on (more on this later). However, they do
            require some indication of the type(s) of content that an
            element will contain.  There are several types available,
            but only two are used in the IODEF:

Internet Draft         draft-ietf-inch-iodef-00.txt             Apr 2002



            PCDATA
            An XML processor will find only text (parsed character data)
            in this element, no tags or entity references (see Section
            3.2.4). This is the content type for all but one of the
            elements at the bottom of the IODEF document tree.

            ANY
            The element may contain anything -- text, other tags, entity
            references, etc.  This is the content type for the
            AdditionalData element (see Section 4.2.4.5).

            In the case where declaring the data is essential, future
            implementations of the IODEF should use an XML Schema
            definition instead of currently used XML DTD.


            There are a variety of attribute content types defined, but
            only two are used in the IODEF:

            CDATA

            An attribute of this type contains character data (text).
            Tags and entity references (see Section 4.2.4) are not
            processed.

            [values]
            An attribute may also be declared with a list of acceptable
            values; this functions somewhat like an enumerated type.
            For example:

            <!ATTLIST Person
               gender     "unknown | male | female"   "unknown"
            >

            The gender attribute may have one of three values; if a
            Person tag appears without a gender attribute, the XML
            processor will behave as though it did have one, with value
            "unknown."



      Within an XML IODEF description, all data will be expressed as
      "text" (as opposed to "binary"), since XML is a text formatting
      language. We provide typing information for the attributes of the
      classes in the data model however, to convey to the reader the
      type of data the model expects for each attribute.

      Each data type in the model has specific formatting requirements
      in an XML IODEF description. These requirements are set forth in

      this section.


      3.4.1 Integers

         Integer attributes are represented by the INTEGER data type.
         Integer data MUST be encoded in Base 10 or Base 16.

         Base 10 integer encoding uses the digits '0' through '9' and an
         optional sign ('+' or '-').  For example, "123", "-456".

         Base 16 integer encoding uses the digits '0' through '9' and
         'a' through 'f' (or their upper case equivalents), and is
         preceded by the characters "0x".  For example, "0x1a2b".


      3.4.2 Real Numbers

         Real (floating-point) attributes are represented by the REAL
         data type.  Real data MUST be encoded in Base 10.

         Real encoding is that of the POSIX "strtod" library function:
         an optional sign ('+' or '-') followed by a non-empty string
         of decimal digits, optionally containing a radix character,
         then an optional exponent part.  An exponent part consists of
         an 'e' or 'E', followed by an optional sign, followed by one
         or more decimal digits.  For example, "123.45e02",
         "-567,89e-03".

         IODEF-compliant applications MUST support both the '.' and ','
         radix characters.


      3.4.3 Characters and Strings

         Single-character attributes are represented by the CHARACTER
         data type.  Multi-character attributes of known length are
         represented by the STRING data type.

         Character and string data have no special formatting
         requirements, other than the need to occasionally use character
         references (see Sections 4.3.2.1 and 4.3.2.2) to represent
         special characters.

      3.4.4 Bytes

         Binary data is represented by the BYTE (and BYTE[]) data type.

         Binary data MUST be encoded in its entirety using character

         code references (see Section 4.3.2.2).


      3.4.5 Enumerated Types

         Enumerated types are represented by the ENUM data type, and
         consist of an ordered list of acceptable values.  Each value
         has a rank (number) and a representing keyword.

         Within an IODEF document, the enumerated type keywords are used
         as attribute values, and the ranks are ignored.  However, those
         IODEF-compliant applications that choose to represent these
         values internally in a numeric format MUST use the rank values
         identified in this memo.


      3.4.6 Date-Time Strings

         Date-time strings are represented by the DATETIME data type.
         Each date-time string identifies a particular instant in time;
         ranges are not supported.

         Date-time strings are formatted according to a subset of ISO
         8601:2000 [13], as show below.

         1. Dates MUST be formatted as follows:

            YYYY-MM-DD

         where YYYY is the four- digit year, MM is the two-digit month
         (01-12), and DD is the two- digit day (01-31).  (Section
         5.2.1.1, "Complete representation -- Extended format" of [13])

         2. Times MUST be formatted as follows:

            hh:mm:ss

         where hh is the two-digit hour (00-24), mm is the two-digit
         minute (00-59), and ss is the two-digit second (00-60).
         (Section 5.3.1.1, "Complete representation -- Extended
         format." of [13])

         Note that midnight has two representations, 00:00:00 and
         24:00:00.  Both representations MUST be supported by
         IODEF-compliant applications, however, the 00:00:00
         representation SHOULD be used whenever possible.

         Note also that this format accounts for leap seconds.  Positive
         leap seconds are inserted between 23:59:59Z and 24:00:00Z and

         are represented as 23:59:60Z.  Negative leap seconds are
         achieved by the omission of 23:59:59Z.  IODEF-compliant
         applications MUST support leap seconds.

         3. Times MAY be formatted to include a decimal fraction of
            seconds, as follows:

            hh:mm:ss.ss     or
            hh:mm:ss,ss

         As many digits as necessary may follow the decimal sign (at
         least one digit must follow the decimal sign).  Decimal
         fractions of hours and minutes are not supported.  (Section
         5.3.1.3, "Representation of decimal fractions." of [13])

         IODEF-compliant applications MUST support the use of both
         decimal signs ('.'  and ',').

         Note that the number of digits in the fraction part does not
         imply anything about accuracy -- i.e., "00.100000", "00,1000"
         and "00.1" are all equivalent.

         4. Times MUST be formatted to include (a) an indication that
            the time is in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), or (b) an
            indication of the difference between the specified time and
            Coordinated Universal Time.

         a. Times in UTC MUST be formatted by appending the letter 'Z'
            to the time string as follows:

            hh:mm:ssZ
            hh:mm:ss.ssZ
            hh:mm:ss,ssZ

            (Section 5.3.3, "Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) -- Extended
             format" of [13])

         b. If the time is ahead of or equal to UTC, a '+' sign is
            appended to the time string; if the time is behind UTC, a
            '-' sign is appended.  Following the sign, the number of
            hours and minutes representing the different from UTC is
            appended, as follows:

            hh:mm:ss+hh:mm
            hh:mm:ss-hh:mm
            hh:mm:ss.ss+hh:mm
            hh:mm:ss.ss-hh:mm
            hh:mm:ss,ss+hh:mm
            hh:mm:ss,ss-hh:mm

Internet Draft         draft-ietf-inch-iodef-00.txt             Apr 2002




         The difference from UTC MUST be specified in both hours and
         minutes, even if the minutes component is 0.  A "difference" of
         "+00:00" is equivalent to UTC.  (Section 5.3.4.2, "Local time
         and the difference with Coordinated Universal Time -- Extended
         Format" of [13])

         5. Date-time strings are created by joining the date and time
            strings with the letter 'T', as shown below:

            YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ
            YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.ssZ
            YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss,ssZ
            YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+hh:mm
            YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss-hh:mm
            YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.ss+hh:mm
            YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.ss-hh:mm
            YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss,ss+hh:mm
            YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss,ss-hh:mm

         (Section 5.4.1, "Complete representation -- Extended format" of
         [13])

         In summary, IODEF date-time strings MUST adhere to one of the
         nine templates identified in Paragraph 5, above.


      3.4.7 NTP Timestamps

         NTP timestamps are represented by the NTPSTAMP data type, and
         are described in detail in [14] and [15].  An NTP timestamp is
         a 64-bit unsigned fixed-point number.  The integer part is in
         the first 32 bits, and the fraction part is in the last 32
         bits.

         Within IODEF descriptions, NTP timestamps MUST be encoded as
         two 32-bit hexadecimal values, separated by a period ('.').
         For example, "0x12345678.0x87654321".


      3.4.8 Port Lists

         A list of network ports are represented by the PORTLIST data
         type, and consist of a comma-separated list of numbers
         (individual integers) and ranges (N-M means ports N through M,
         inclusive). Any combination of numbers and ranges may be used
         in a single list. For example,
         "5-25,37,42,43,53,69-119,123-514".

      3.4.9 Unique Identifiers

         There are several types of unique identifiers used in this
         specification. All types are represented by the STRING data
         type.

         These identifiers are implemented as attributes in the relevant
         XML elements, and must have unique values as follows:

         1. If specified, the attribute of the Authority class (Section
         5.2.6.8) OrganizationID MUST have a value that is globally
         unique. It may be a combination of the Registry name and unique
         CSIRT ID in this Registry. FIRST or industry associations
         normally maintain registries.

         The default value is "unknown", which indicates that the
         authority or CISRT does not have unique identifiers.

         2. The Incident, Attacker, Evidence, Victim, Source, Target,
         Node, User, Process, Service, Address, and UserID classes (see
         correspondent sections) are provided with "ident" attribute,
         which if specified, MUST have a value that is unique across all
         IODEF Descriptions created by the particular CSIRT or
         Authority.

         The "ident" attribute value MUST be unique for each particular
         combination of data identifying an object, not for each object.
         Objects may have more than one ident value associated with
         them. For example, an identification of a host by name would
         have one value, while an identification of that host by address
         would have another value, and an identification of that host by
         both name and address would have still another value.
         Furthermore, different analyzers may produce different values
         for the same information.

         The "ident" attribute by itself provides a unique identifier
         only among all the "ident" values created/stored by a
         particular CSIRT or IHS. But when combined with the unique
         "OrganizationID" value for the CSIRT, there is no requirement
         for global uniqueness.  The default value is "0", which
         indicates that the CSIRT/IHS cannot generate unique
         identifiers.

         The specification of methods for creating the unique values
         contained in these attributes is outside the scope of this
         document.

      3.4.10 Personal names

Internet Draft         draft-ietf-inch-iodef-00.txt             Apr 2002




         The format for personal names is the same as in LDAP.
         Personal names will likely be obtained from the different
         directories used by a CSIRT.

         The suggested personal name formats are as follows:

         Name Surname

         Or

         Surname, Name

         It is also possible to use a personal handle from a registry
         database (e.g., RIPE NCC, InterNIC). In this case, the
         element's attribute will indicate the type of personal name
         used and indirectly point to the referenced registry.

      3.4.11 Organization names

         Organization name can be in the form of a full name, short
         name or identification code retrieved from official Registries.

         It is possible to use an organization handle (or organization
         role from a registry (e.g., RIPE NCC, InterNIC).  In this
         case, the element's attribute will indicate the type of
         organization name.

      3.4.12 Postal addresses

         The format of postal address data is the same as in LDAP
         Postal addresses will likely be obtained directly from an
         incident report or from the different directories used by
         the CSIRT.

         Building, Street, Zip-code, City, Country

         Or

         Post Office Box, Zip-code, City, Country

      3.4.13 Telephone and Fax numbers

         Telephone and fax numbers are expressed in the format
         recommended by ITU guidelines.

         + (international code) (local code) (tel. Number)

4. The IODEF Data Model and XML DTD

   In this section, the individual components of the IODEF data model
   are explained in details.  UML diagrams of the model are provided to
   illustrate the relationship between components.  Likewise, relevant
   sections of the XML DTD are presented to describe how the model is
   translated into XML.


   4.1 Data Model Overview

      The relationship between the principal components of the data
      model is shown in Figure 5.1 (cardinality and attributes are
      omitted).

      IODEF-Description is the top-level container class for all IODEF
      documents. Recognizing that incidents might require different
      types of data, sub-classes of this root class called incident
      descriptions are defined.  There are presently two types of
      descriptions defined: the Incident class to describe an incident
      and the IncidentAlert class to allow seamless support for IODEF
      alerts.

      It is important to note that the data model does not define the
      events that constitute an incident. The notion of an incident is
      very site-specific.  For example, a port scan may be identified by
      one CSIRT as a single incident with multiple victims.  Another
      CSIRT might separate this activity as multiple incidents each from
      a single source to a single victim. Regardless, once the creator
      of the report has determined a logical grouping of events that
      constitute an incident, the data model dictates how that
      description should be formatted.

      Figure 4.1  Data model overview

      The individual classes are described in the following sections.


   4.2 The IODEF-Description Class

      IODEF-Description is the root container class of the IODEF data
      model.  There are currently two main types (subclasses) of IODEF-
      Description: Incident and IncidentAlert. A third Experimental
      class is also included temporarily for testing.

      Since DTDs do not support subclassing (see Section 4.3.4), the
      inheritance relationship between the IODEF-Description and the
      Incident and IncidentAlert subclasses shown in Figure 5.1 has been
      replaced with an aggregate relationship.

      NOTE: The use of aggregation to implement an inheritance
      relationship is done throughout the data model.


      The IODEF-Description class is declared in the IODEF DTD as
      follows:

      <!ENTITY % attlist.IODEF                  "
         version               CDATA                 #FIXED    '0.0'
      ">
      <!ELEMENT IODEF-Description                   (
         (Incident | IncidentAlert)*
      )>
      <!ATTLIST IODEF-Description
         %attlist.IODEF;
      >

      The IODEF-Description class has a single attribute:

        version

      The version of the IODEF-Description specification (this
      document) to which the document conforms. Applications
      specifying a value for this attribute MUST use the value "0.0".


   4.3 The Incident Class

      For a given incident, the CSIRT will create an instance of the
      Incident class. The information used to populate this class will
      come from the reporting infrastructure that the CSIRT already has
      in place. Thus, direct reports from their constituency, IDS alert
      messages, or collaboration with other CSIRTS could serve as

      potential input.

      An Incident description is composed of several aggregate classes,
      as shown in Figure 4.2. The aggregate classes themselves are
      described in Sections 4.2.4.1 - 4.2.4.10.

   4.4 The CorrelationIncident Class

      The CorrelationIncident class represents information related to
      the correlation of current incident. It is intended as a way by
      which to logically group previously reported incidents as related.

      The CorrelationIncident class is composed of three aggregate
      classes, as shown in Figure 4.3.

      +---------------------+        +----------------+

      Figure 4.3 - The CorrelationIncident Class


      The aggregate classes that constitute CorrelationIncident are:

      IncidentID
         Zero or one. STRING.  Identifier of current Incident. If not
         included into CorrelationIncident class, this value may be
         derived from the top class Incident attribute.

      EvidenceDataID
         Zero or more.  Evidence data that are linked to current
         Incident.

      EventList
         One or more.  Lists all events which are investigated together,
         or have another common denominator.

      This is represented in the XML DTD as follows:

      <!ELEMENT CorrelationIncident (
         IncidentID?, EventList*, EvidenceDataID*
      )>

      <!ATTLIST CorrelationIncident

         element.

         
      4.4.1  The EventList Class

         The EventList class contains information about events which are
         treated as correlated with respect to current incident.

         Figure 4.6  The Attack Class


         The aggregate classes that constitute Attack are:

         Source
            Zero or more.  The source(s) of the event(s) causing the
            incident.

         Target
            Zero or more.  The target(s) of the event(s) in the
            incident.

         Description
            Zero or more.  A free-form textual description by the CSIRT
            or report of the incident events.

         DetectTime

Internet Draft         draft-ietf-inch-iodef-00.txt             Apr 2002



            Zero or one.  The time when the incident activity was first
            detected by the reporter. In the case of more than one
            event, the time the first event was detected. In some
            circumstances, this time may not be the same as the
            RegistrationTime used in the History class.

         StartTime
            Zero or one.  The start time of the incident activity.

         EndTime
            Zero or one.  The end time of the incident activity.


         This is represented in the XML DTD as follows:

         <!ELEMENT Attack   (
            Source*, Target*, Description*,
            DetectTime?, StartTime?, EndTime?)>

         >

         The Attack class has two attributes:

         ident
            Optional. A unique identifier for this Attack class (see
            Section 3.4.9).

         restriction
            Optional. Sets a restriction on the usage of the data in
            element.


      4.6.1 The Source Class

         The Source class contains information about the possible
         source(s) of the incident event(s). An event may have more than
         one source (e.g., in a distributed denial of service attack).
         For the purpose of compatibility, the Source class has been
         reused from the IDMEF. Hence, the Source class from an IDMEF
         message can be included unmodified into the IODEF-Description
         class with the same semantics.  Likewise, the data in an
         IDMEF-originating Source class could be decomposed between the
         IODEF Source and Attack classes.

         The definition of the Source class in the IODEF data model is a

         superset of the IDMEF definition.  Two new classes have been
         added: os and program.

         The Source class is composed of four aggregate classes, as
         shown in Figure 4.7.

            The Address class is composed of two aggregate classes, as
            shown in Figure 4.17.


            +------------------+
            |     Address      |

            Figure 4.17  The Address Class

            The aggregate classes that constitute Address are:

            address
               Exactly one.  STRING.  The address whose format is
               governed by the category attribute.

            netmask
               Zero or one.  STRING.  The network mask for the address,
               if appropriate.

            This is represented in the XML DTD as follows:

            <!ENTITY % attvals.addrcat                "
               ( unknown | atm | e-mail | lotus-notes | mac | sna | vm |
                 ipv4-addr | ipv4-addr-hex | ipv4-net | ipv4-net-mask |
                 ipv6-addr | ipv6-addr-hex | ipv6-net | ipv6-net-mask )
            ">
            <!ELEMENT Address                         (
               address, netmask?
            )>
            <!ATTLIST Address
               ident                 CDATA               '0'
               category              %attvals.addrcat;   'unknown'
               vlan-name             CDATA               #IMPLIED
               vlan-num              CDATA               #IMPLIED
            >

            The Address class has four attributes:

            ident
               Optional.  A unique identifier for the address (see
               Section 3.4.9).

      4.6.3 The User Class

         The User class describes a user account on a system.  It is
         primarily used as a "container" class for the UserId aggregate
         class, as shown in Figure 4.18.

         More than one UserId can be used within the User class to
         indicate attempts to transition from one user to another, or to
         provide complete information about a user's (or process')
         privileges.

         +---------------+

         Figure 4.18  The User Class

         The aggregate class contained in User is:

         UserId
            One or more.  The user.

         This is represented in the XML DTD as follows:

         <!ENTITY % attvals.usercat                "
            ( unknown | application | os-device )

         >

         The User class has two attributes:

         ident
            Optional.  A unique identifier for the user (see Section
            3.4.9).

         4.6.3.1 The UserId Class

            The UserId class describes a specific user account on a
            system.

            The UserId class is composed of two aggregate classes, as
            shown in Figure 4.19.

            +--------------+
            |    UserId    |

            +--------------+

            Figure 4.19  The UserId Class


            The aggregate classes that constitute UserId are:

            name
               Zero or one.  STRING.  A user or group name.

            number
               Zero or one.  INTEGER.  A user or group number.

            This is represented in the XML DTD as follows:

                                  this would be the "real" user id.
              1    original-user  The actual identity of the user or

                                  systems that (a) do some type of
                                  auditing and (b) support extracting a
                                  user id from the "audit id" token,
                                  that value should be used.  On those
                                  systems that do not support this, and

                                  attempting to become.  For example,
                                  on Unix systems when the
                                  user attempts to use "su," "rlogin,"
                                  "telnet," etc.

                                  systems, this would be the "effective"
                                  user id.  Multiple UserId elements of
                                  this type may be used to specify a

                                  on the file.  On Unix systems, this
                                  would be the "world" permissions.



      4.6.4 The Process Class

         The Process class describes a process being executed on a system.

         The Process class is composed of five aggregate classes, as
         shown in Figure 4.20.

         +--------------+
         |    Process   |
         +--------------+            +------+
         | STRING ident |<>----------| name |
         |              |            +------+

         Figure 4.20  The Process Class

         The aggregate classes that constitute Process are:

         name
            Exactly one.  STRING.  The filename of the program being
            executed.  This is a short name; path and argument
            information are provided elsewhere.

         pid

Internet Draft         draft-ietf-inch-iodef-00.txt             Apr 2002



            Zero or one.  INTEGER.  The process identifier of the
            process.

         path
            Zero or one.  STRING.  The full path of the program being
            executed.

         arg
            Zero or more.  STRING.  A command-line argument to the
            program.  Multiple arguments may be specified (they are
            assumed to have occurred in the same order they are
            provided) with multiple uses of arg.

         env
            Zero or more.  STRING.  An environment string associated
            with the process; generally of the format "VARIABLE=value".
            Multiple environment strings may be specified with multiple
            uses of env.

         This is represented in the XML DTD as follows:

         <!ELEMENT Process                         (
            name, pid?, path?, arg*, env*
         )>
         <!ATTLIST Process
            ident                 CDATA                   '0'
         >

         The Process class has one attribute:

         ident
            Optional.  A unique identifier for the process (see Section
            3.4.9).


      4.6.5 The Service Class

         The Service class describes a network service. It can identify
         services by name, port, and protocol.

         When Service occurs as an aggregate class of Source, it is
         understood that the service is one from which activity of
         interest is originating; and that the service is "attached" to
         the Node, Process, and User information also contained in
         Source.  Likewise, when Service occurs as an aggregate class of
         Target, it is understood that the service is one to which
         activity of interest is being directed; and that the service is
         "attached" to the Node, Process, and User information also
         contained in Target.

Internet Draft         draft-ietf-inch-iodef-00.txt             Apr 2002




         The Service class is composed of four aggregate classes, as
         shown in Figure 4.21.

         +--------------+
         |   Service    |
         +--------------+       0..1 +----------+

             | SNMPService |--+--| WebService  |
             +-------------+     +-------------+

         Figure 4.21 - The Service Class

         The aggregate classes that constitute Service are:

         name
            Zero or one.  STRING.  The name of the service.  Whenever
            possible, the name from the IANA list of well-known ports
            SHOULD be used.

         port
            Zero or one.  INTEGER.  The port number being used.

         portlist

            Zero or one.  PORTLIST.  A list of port numbers being used;
            see Section 3.4.8 for formatting rules.

         protocol
            Zero or one.  STRING.  The protocol being used.

         A Service MUST be specified as either (a) a name, (b) a port,
         (c) a name and a port, or (d) a portlist.  The protocol is

         optional in all cases, but no other combinations are permitted.

         Because DTDs do not support subclassing (see Section 4.3.4),
         the inheritance relationship between Service and the
         SNMPService and WebService subclasses shown in Figure 5.17 has
         been replaced with an aggregate relationship. Service is
         represented in the XML DTD as follows:

         <!ELEMENT Service                         (
            ((name | port | (name, port)) | portlist), protocol?,
              SNMPService?, WebService?
         )>
         <!ATTLIST Service
            ident                 CDATA                   '0'
         >

         The Service class has one attribute:

         ident
            Optional.  A unique identifier for the service, see Section
            3.4.9.


         4.6.5.1 The WebService Class

            The WebService class augments the Service class with
            additional information related to web traffic.

            The WebService class is composed of four aggregate classes,
            as shown in Figure 4.22.

            +-------------+
            |   Service   |

            Figure 4.22  The WebService Class

            The aggregate classes that constitute WebService are:

            url
               Exactly one.  STRING.  The URL in the request.

            cgi
               Zero or one.  STRING.  The CGI script in the request,
               without arguments.

            http-method
               Zero or one.  STRING.  The HTTP method (PUT, GET) used in
               the request.

            arg
               Zero or more.  STRING.  The arguments to the CGI script.

            This is represented in the XML DTD as follows:

            <!ELEMENT WebService                      (
               url, cgi?, http-method?, arg*
            )>


         4.6.5.2 The SNMPService Class

            The SNMPService class augments the Service class with
            additional information related to SNMP traffic.

            The SNMPService class is composed of three aggregate
            classes, as shown in Figure 4.23.

            +-------------+

            +-------------+

            Figure 4.23  The SNMPService Class

            The aggregate classes that constitute SNMPService are:

            oid
               Zero or one.  STRING.  The object identifier in the
               request.

            community
               Zero or one.  STRING.  The object's community string.

            command
               Zero or one.  STRING.  The command sent to the SNMP
               server (GET, SET.  etc.).

            This is represented in the XML DTD as follows:

            <!ELEMENT SNMPService                     (
               oid?, community?, command?
            )>



      4.6.6 The Target Class

         The Target class contains information about the possible
         target(s) of the incident event(s).  An event may have more
         than one target (e.g., in the case of a port sweep).

         For the purpose of compatibility, the Target class has been
         reused from the IDMEF. Hence, the Target class from an IDMEF
         message can be included unmodified into the IODEF-Description
         class with the same semantics.  Likewise, the data in an
         IDMEF-originating Source class could be decomposed between the
         IODEF Target and Attack classes.

         The definition of the Target class in the IODEF data model is a
         superset of the IDMEF definition.  Two new classes have been
         added: os and program.

         The Target class is composed of four aggregate classes, as
         shown in Figure 4.8.

         program
            Zero or one.  The program running as the Process, which was
            targeted in the Attack.


         This is represented in the XML DTD as follows:

         <!ENTITY % attvals.yesno   "

         The FileList class describes files and other file-like objects
         on targets.  It is primarily used as a "container" class for
         the File aggregate class, as shown in Figure 5.33. For the
         purpose of compatibility the FileList Class is reused from the
         IDMEF.


         +--------------+
         |   FileList   |
         +--------------+       1..* +------+
         |              |<>----------| File |

         +--------------+

         Figure 4.33  The FileList Class

         The aggregate class contained in FileList is:

         File
            One or more.  Information about an individual file, as
            indicated by its "category" and "fstype" attributes (see
            Section 4.8.13.1).

         This is represented in the XML DTD as follows:

         <!ELEMENT FileList                        (
            File+
         )>


         4.6.7.1 The File Class

            The File class provides specific information about a file or
            other file-like object that has been created, deleted, or
            modified on the target.  More than one File can be used
            within the FileList class to provide information about more
            than one file.  The description can provide either the file
            settings prior to the event or the file settings at the time
            of the event, as specified using the "category" attribute.

            The File class is composed of ten aggregate classes, as
            shown in Figure 4.34.

            Figure 4.34  The File Class

            The aggregate classes that make up File are:

            name
               Exactly one.  STRING.  The name of the file to which the
               alert applies, not including the path to the file.

            path

               Exactly one.  STRING.  The full path to the file,
               including the name.  The path name should be represented
               in as "universal" a manner as possible, to facilitate
               processing of the alert.

               For Windows systems, the path should be specified using
               the Universal Naming Convention (UNC) for remote files,
               and using a drive letter for local files (e.g.,
               "C:\boot.ini").  For Unix systems, paths on network file
               systems should use the name of the mounted resource



Meijer, et al.            Expires March 2003                   [page 55]

               instead of the local mount point (e.g.,
               "fileserver:/usr/local/bin/foo").  The mount point can be
               provided using the <Linkage> element.

            create-time
               Zero or one.  DATETIME.  Time the file was created.  Note
               that this is *not* the Unix "st_ctime" file attribute
               (which is not file creation time).  The Unix "st_ctime"
               attribute is contained in the "Inode" class.

            modify-time
               Zero or one.  DATETIME.  Time the file was last modified.

            access-time
               Zero or one.  DATETIME.  Time the file was last accessed.

            data-size
               Zero or one.  INTEGER.  The size of the data, in bytes.
               Typically what is meant when referring to file size.  On
               Unix UFS file systems, this value corresponds to
               stat.st_size.  On Windows NTFS, this value corres- ponds
               to VDL.

            disk-size
               Zero or one.  INTEGER.  The physical space on disk
               consumed by the file, in bytes.  On Unix UFS file
               systems, this value corresponds to 512 * stat.st_blocks.
               On Windows NTFS, this value corresponds to EOF.

            FileAccess
               Zero or more.  Access permissions on the file.

            Linkage
               Zero or more.  File system objects to which this file is
               linked (other references for the file).

            Inode
               Zero or one.  Inode information for this file (relevant
               to Unix).

            This is represented in the XML DTD as follows:

            <!ENTITY % attvals.filecat           "

            The File class has three attributes:

            ident
               Optional.  A unique identifier for this file, see Section
               3.4.9.

            category
               Required.  The context for the information being
               provided.  The permitted values are shown below.  There
               is no default value.

                                  the reported change

            fstype Required.  The type of file system the file resides
            on.  The name should be specified using a standard
            abbreviation, e.g., "ufs", "nfs", "afs", "ntfs", "fat16",
            "fat32", "pcfs", "joliet", "cdfs", etc.  This attribute
            governs how path names and other attributes are interpreted.


         4.6.7.2 The FileAccess Class

            The FileAccess class represents the access permissions on a
            file. The representation is intended to be usefule across
            operating systems.

            The FileAccess class is composed of two aggregate classes,
            as shown in Figure 4.35.

            +--------------+
            |  FileAccess  |
            +--------------+            +------------+
            |              |<>----------|   UserId   |

            |              |<>----------| permission |
            |              |            +------------+

            +--------------+

            Figure 4.35  The FileAccess Class

            The aggregate classes that make up FileAccess are:

            UserId
               Exactly one.  The user (or group) to which these
               permissions apply.  The value of the "type" attribute
               must be "user-privs", "group-privs", or "other-privs" as
               appropriate.  Other values for "type" MUST NOT be used in
               this context.

            permission
               One or more.  STRING.  Level of access allowed.
               Recommended values are "noAccess", "read", "write",
               "execute", "delete", "executeAs", "changePermissions",
               and "takeOwnership".  The "changePermissions" and
               "takeOwnership" strings represent those concepts in
               Windows.  On Unix, the owner of the file always has
               "changePermissions" access, even if no other access is
               allowed for that user.  "Full Control" in Windows is
               represented by enumerating the permissions it contains.
               The "executeAs" string represents the set-user-id and
               set-group-id features in Unix.

            This is represented in the XML DTD as follows:

            <!ELEMENT FileAccess                      (
               UserId, permission+
            )>


         4.6.7.3 The Linkage Class

            The Linkage class represents file system connections between
            the file described in the <File> element and other objects
            in the file system.  For example, if the <File> element is a
            symbolic link or shortcut, then the <Linkage> element should
            contain the name of the object the link points to.  Further
            information can be provided about the object in the
            <Linkage> element with another <File> element, if
            appropriate.

            The Linkage class is composed of three aggregate classes, as
            shown in Figure 4.36.

            +--------------+
            |   Linkage    |

            +--------------+

            Figure 4.36  The Linkage Class

            The aggregate classes that make up Linkage are:

            name
               Exactly one.  STRING.  The name of the file system object
               not including the path.

            path
               Exactly one.  STRING.  The full path to the file system
               object, including the name.  The path name should be
               represented in as "universal" a manner as possible, to
               facilitate processing of the alert.

            File
               Exactly one.  A <File> element may be used in place of
               the <name> and <path> elements if additional information
               about the file is to be included.

            The is represented in the XML DTD as follows:

            <!ENTITY % attvals.linkcat               "
               ( hard-link | mount-point | reparse-point | shortcut |
                 stream | symbolic-link )
            ">

               category             %attvals.linkcat;       #REQUIRED
            >

            The Linkage class has one attribute:

            category
               The type of object that the link describes.  The
               permitted values are shown below.  There is no default
               value.

      4.6.8 The Description Class

         The Description class is a general-purpose class for any
         natural language free-form text.

         Using the XML language attribute, it is reasonable to include
         text in a number of different languages in different instances
         of the Description class. For details on declaring language
         attribute see section 3.3.3.

         <!ELEMENT Description xml:lang="langcode">

      4.6.9 The DetectTime Class

         The time when the incident activity was first detected by the
         reporter.

         <!ELEMENT DetectTime            (#PCDATA) >
         <!ATTLIST DetectTime
            ntpstamp              CDATA                   #REQUIRED
         >

         The DATETIME format of the <DetectTime> element content is
         described in Section 3.4.6.

         The DetectTime class has one attribute:

         ntpstamp

            Required.  The NTP timestamp representing the same date and
            time as the element content.  The NTPSTAMP format of this
            attribute's value is described in Section 3.4.7.

            If the date and time represented by the element content and
            the NTP timestamp differ (should "never" happen), the value
            in the NTP timestamp MUST be used.


      4.6.10 The StartTime Class

         The start time of the incident activity.

         It is represented in the XML DTD as follows:

         <!ELEMENT StartTime            (#PCDATA) >

         The DATETIME format of the <StartTime> element content is

      4.6.11 The EndTime Class

         The end time of the incident activity.

         It is represented in the XML DTD as follows:

         <!ELEMENT EndTime            (#PCDATA) >

         The DATETIME format of the <StartTime> element content is
         described in Section 3.4.6.



   4.7 The Method Class

      The Method class provides information about the method used by the
      Attacker in the incident. This class can reference well-known
      vulnerability or exploit databases, as well as allow for a
      free-form description of the activity.

      The Method class is composed of two aggregate classes, as shown in
      Figure 4.9.

      +------------------+
      | Method           |

      4.10 The Record Class

         The Record class contains supportive data that provides a
         record of incident activity. The source of this activity record
         will be typically data exported from a monitoring tool or the
         results of a computer forensics investigation.  The record data
         can consist of both data and textual information

         Figure 4.26  The RecordDesc Class

         The aggregate classes that constitute RecordDesc are:

         DetectTime
            Zero or one. Timestamp of the supportive data.  This data
            MUST be present if it is not already represented in the
            EvidenceItem class.

         Analyzer
            Zero or one.  The facility used to gather the supportive
            data.  The analyzer SHOULD define the name of the format,
            facility, tool, or device used to generate the supportive
            data if it is not self-describing (e.g. xml).  Likewise, the
            analyzer SHOULD define the Node which detected the
            supportive data or from which it was extracted if this
            information is not represented elsewhere.

         Description
            Zero or one. Free-form text to make comments on or annotate
            the supportive data.


         This is represented in the XML DTD as follows:

         The Analyzer class identifies the facility used to gather the
         evidence or tool generated Incident Alert. In case when Initial
         Incident registration is produced from the IDMEF message the
         Analyzer description may be taken from the IDMEF message where
         the Analyzer Class is mandatory and only one.

         The analyzer SHOULD define the name of the format, facility,
         tool, or device used to generate the evidence if it is not
         self-describing (e.g. xml). Likewise, the analyzer SHOULD
         define the Node which detected the evidence or from which it
         was extracted if this information is not represented elsewhere.

         For the purpose of compatibility the Analyzer Class is reused
         from the IDMEF.

         The Analyzer class is composed of two aggregate classes, as
         shown in Figure 4.38.


         +---------------------+
         |      Analyzer       |

         Figure 4.38  The Analyzer Class

         The aggregate classes that make up Analyzer are:

         Node
            Zero or one.  Information about the host or device on which
            the analyzer resides (network address, network name, etc.).

         Process
            Zero or one.  Information about the process in which the
            analyzer is executing.

         This is represented in the XML DTD as follows:

            and/or hardware.

         version
            Optional.  The version number of the analyzer software
            and/or hardware.

         class
            Optional.  The class of analyzer software and/or hardware.

         ostype
            Optional.  Operating system name.  On POSIX systems, this is
            the value returned in utsname.sysname by the uname() system
            call, or the output of the "uname -s" command.

         osversion
            Optional.  Operating system version.  On POSIX systems, this
            is the value returned in utsname.release by the uname()
            system call, or the output of the "uname -r" command.

         The "manufacturer", "model", "version", and "class" attributes'
         contents are vendor-specific, but may be used together to
         identify different types of analyzers.

      used to provide atomic data (integers, strings, etc.) in cases
      where only small amounts of additional information needed to be
      represented.  However, the class can also be used to extend the
      data model and the DTD to support proprietary IODEF extensions or
      for encapsulating external XML document such as IDMEF messages.
      Detailed instructions for extending the data model and the DTD are
      provided in Section 5.

      The AdditionalData element is declared in the XML DTD as follows:

      <!ENTITY % attvals.adtype   "
         ( boolean | byte | character | date-time | integer |
           ntpstamp | portlist | real | string | xml )

   4.12 The History Class


      The History class contains a log of the significant events that
      occurred or actions performed by the involved parties (e.g.,
      initial reporter, investigating CSIRT, or involved system
      administrators) during the course of handling the incident.

      The level of detail maintained in this log is left up to the
      discretion of those handling the incident.

      Figure 4.13 - The Assessment Class

      The aggregate classes that make up Assessment are:

      Impact
         Zero or one.  The CSIRT's assessment of the impact of the event
         on the target(s).

      Action
        Zero or more.  The action(s) taken by the CSIRT in response to
        the event.

      Confidence
         A measurement of the confidence the CSIRT has in its evaluation
         of the event.

      This is represented in the XML DTD as follows:

      <!ELEMENT Assessment                     (
         Impact?, Action*, Confidence?

         description of the action, if the description of the taken
         actions needs to be expressed in free language.


      4.13.3 The Confidence Class

         The Confidence class is used to represent the CSIRT's best
         estimate of the validity of its Incident Assessment.  It is
         represented in the XML DTD as follows:

         <!ENTITY % attvals.rating                "
            ( low | medium | high | numeric )
         ">

         >

         The Confidence class has one attribute:

         rating
            The CSIRT's rating of its assessment validity.  The
            permitted values are shown below.  The default value is
            "numeric."

            Rank   Keyword            Description

                                      its validity

         This element should be used only when the CSIRT/triage can
         produce meaningful information.  Systems that can output only a
         rough heuristic should use "low", "medium", or "high" as the
         rating value.  In this case, the element content should be
         omitted.

         Systems capable of producing reasonable probability estimates
         should use "numeric" as the rating value and include a numeric
         confidence value in the element content. This numeric value
         should reflect a posterior probability (the probability that an
         attack has occurred given the data seen by the detection system
         and the model used by the system). It is a floating point
         number between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive. The number of digits
         should be limited to those representable by a single precision
         floating point value, and may be represented as described in
         Section 3.4.2.

         NOTE:

         It should be noted that different types of Incident handling
         Systems may compute confidence values in different ways and
         that in many cases, confidence values from different CSIRTs
         should not be compared (for example, if the CSIRTs use
         different methods of computing or representing confidence, or
         are of different types or configurations).  Care should be
         taken when implementing systems that process confidence values
         (such as event correlators) not to make comparisons or
         assumptions that cannot be supported by the system's knowledge
         of the environment in which it is working.


   4.14 The Authority Class

      The Authority class names and provides contact information for the
      CSIRT who created and is handling the incident.

5. Extending the IODEF

   In order to support the changing activity of CSIRTS, the IODEF data
   model and DTD will need to evolve along with them. To allow new
   features to be added, both the data model and the DTD can be extended
   as described in this section.  As these extensions mature, they can
   then be incorporated into future versions of the specification.


   5.1 Extending the Data Model

      There are two mechanisms for extending the IODEF data model:
      inheritance and aggregation (see Section 3.1.1).

      +  By using inheritance, new subclasses may be derived and given
         additional attributes or operations not found in the
         superclass.

      +  Aggregation allows for entirely new, self-contained classes to
         be created and associated with a parent class.

      Of the two extension mechanisms, inheritance is preferred, because
      it preserves the existing data model and the operations (methods)
      executed on the classes of the model. There are explicit
      guidelines for extending the XML DTD (see Section 5.2) which set
      limits on where extensions to the data model may be made.


   5.2 Extending the XML DTD

      There are two ways to extend the IODEF XML DTD:

      1. The AdditionalData class (see Section 4.2.4.5) allows
         implementers to include arbitrary "atomic" data items
         (integers, strings, etc.) in an Incident or IncidentAlert
         class.  This approach SHOULD be used whenever possible.



Meijer, et al.            Expires March 2003                   [page 88]

Internet Draft         draft-ietf-inch-iodef-00.txt             Apr 2002




      2. The AdditionalData class allows implementers to extend the
         IODEF XML DTD with additional DTD "modules" that describe
         arbitrarily complex data types and relationships.

      To extend the IODEF DTD with a new DTD "module," these guidelines
      MUST be followed:

      1. The IODEF description MUST include a document type declaration
         (see Section 3.3.1.3).

      2. The document type declaration MUST define a parameter entity
         (see Section 3.2.4) that contains the location of the extension
         DTD, and then reference that entity:

         <!DOCTYPE IODEF-Description SYSTEM
            "/path/to/IODEF-Description.dtd"
         [
            <!ENTITY % x-extension SYSTEM "/path/to/extension.dtd">
            %x-extension;
         ]>

         In this example, the "x-extension" parameter entity is defined
         and then referenced, causing the DTD for the extension to be
         read by the XML parser.

         The name of the parameter entity defined for this purpose MUST
         be a string beginning with "x-"; there are no other
         restrictions on the name (other than those imposed on all
         entity names by XML).

         Multiple extensions may be included by defining multiple
         entities and referencing them.  For example:

         <!DOCTYPE IODEF-Description SYSTEM
            "/path/to/IODEF-Description.dtd"
         [
            <!ENTITY % x-extension SYSTEM "/path/to/extension.dtd">
            <!ENTITY % x-another SYSTEM "/path/to/another.dtd">
            %x-extension;
            %x-another;
         ]>

      3. Extension DTDs MUST declare all of their elements and
         attributes in a separate XML namespace.  Extension DTDs MUST
         NOT declare any elements or attributes in the "IODEF" or
         default namespaces.

         For example, the "test" extension might be declared as follows:



Meijer, et al.            Expires March 2003                   [page 89]

Internet Draft         draft-ietf-inch-iodef-00.txt             Apr 2002




        <!ELEMENT test:test (
           test:a, test:b, test:c
        )>
        <!ATTLIST test:test
           xmlns      CDATA   #IMPLIED
           xmlns:test CDATA   #IMPLIED
        >
        <!ELEMENT test:a (#PCDATA)>
        <!ATTLIST test:a
           test:attr   CDATA   #IMPLIED
        >

        <!ELEMENT test:b (#PCDATA)>
        <!ELEMENT test:c (#PCDATA)>

     4. Extensions MUST only be included in the AdditionalData class of
        the Incident class whose "type" attribute is "xml".  For
        example:

        <IODEF-Description version="0.0">
           <Incident ident="...">
              ...
              <AdditionalData type="xml">
                 <test:test
                    xmlns:test="http://www.ietf.org/iodef/test.html"
                    xmlns="http://www.ietf.org/iodef/test.html">
                    <test:a test:attr="...">...</test:a>
                    <test:b>...</test:b>
                    <test:c>...</test:c>
                 </test:test>
              </AdditionalData>
           </Incident>
        </IODEF-Description>



6.  Special Considerations

   This section discusses some of the special considerations that must
   be taken into account by implementers of the IODEF.


   6.1 XML Validity and Well-Formedness

      It is expected that IODEF-compliant applications will normally not
      include the IODEF DTD in their communications.  Instead, the DTD
      will be referenced in the document type declaration of the IODEF
      document rsee Section 3.3.1). Such IODEF documents will be



Meijer, et al.            Expires March 2003                   [page 90]

Internet Draft         draft-ietf-inch-iodef-00.txt             Apr 2002



      well-formed and valid as defined in [5].

      Other IODEF documents will be specified that do not include the
      document prolog (e.g., entries in an IODEF-format database). Such
      IODEF documents will be well-formed but not valid.

      Generally, well-formedness implies that a document has a single
      element that contains everything else (e.g., "<Book>"), and that
      all the other elements nest nicely within each other without any
      overlapping (e.g., a "chapter" does not start in the middle of
      another "chapter").

      Validity further implies that not only is the document
      well-formed, but it also follows specific rules (contained in the
      Document Type Definition) about which elements are "legal" in the
      document, how those elements nest within other elements, and so on
      (e.g., a "chapter" does not begin in the middle of a "title").  A
      document cannot be valid unless it references a DTD.

      XML processors are required to parse any well-formed document,
      valid or not.  The purpose of validation is to make the processing
      of the document (what's done with the data after it's parsed)
      easier.  Without validation, a document may contain elements in
      nonsense order, elements "invented" by the author that the
      processing application doesn't understand, and so on.

     IODEF documents MUST be well-formed.  IODEF documents SHOULD be
     valid whenever both possible and practical.


   6.2 Unrecognized XML Tags

      On occasion, an IODEF-compliant application may receive a well-
      formed, or even well-formed and valid, IODEF document containing
      tags that it does not understand.  The tags may be either:

      +  Recognized as "legitimate" (a valid document), but the
         application does not know the semantic meaning of the element's
         content; or

      +  Not recognized at all.

      IODEF-compliant applications MUST continue to process IODEF
      documents that contain unknown tags, provided that these documents
      are well- formed (see Section 6.1).  It is up to the individual
      application to decide how to process (or ignore) any content from
      the unknown tag(s).

      Special issue is related to inheritance relation between



Meijer, et al.            Expires March 2003                   [page 91]

Internet Draft         draft-ietf-inch-iodef-00.txt             Apr 2002



      Incident/Attacker related classes IDMEF and IODEF, e.g. IODEF
      message may be simply wrap up into IDMEF container for the
      IncidentAlert class.

      In particular case of relations between IODEF and IDMEF, the IODEF
      may be treated as IDMEF extension applying inheritance to
      incorporate Alert/IDMEF data structure into Attack Class of IODEF.

      When Incident description is produced of IDMEF message, IODEF may
      use directly related data classes from IDMEF. In this context it
      is recommended that IHS understands both format - IODEF and IDMEF.
      This may be achieved by mapping part of IDMEF classes (XML tags)
      related to Attack description into IODEF classes. This is to be
      not difficult task because of initial approach to match IODEF and
      IDMEF XML namespaces. Otherwise IODEF parser will still be able to
      parser well- formed IDMEF document and recognize important XML
      tags, which meaning in IODEF is inherited from IDMEF.


   6.3 Digital Signatures

      The joint IETF/W3C XML Signature Working Group is currently
      working to specify XML digital signature processing rules and
      syntax [16].  XML Signatures provide integrity, message
      authentication, and/or signer authentication services for data of
      any type, whether located within the XML that includes the
      signature or elsewhere.

      The IODEF requirements [2] recommend that the IODEF should support
      content confidentiality, integrity, authentication and non-
      repudiation. These requirements can be achieved by the inclusion
      of digital signatures within an IODEF document. Additional
      security considerations may be applied to the communications
      methods and protocols used for IODEF documents exchange.

      Specifications for the use of digital signatures within IODEF
      documents are outside the scope of this document.  If such
      functionality is needed, the use of the XML Signature standard is
      RECOMMENDED.



7. Experimental implementation and examples

   There is an ongoing effort among a few European CSIRTs to implement
   IODEF in their daily incident handling work [17]. The results this
   project should be available in late 2001.

   This section provides examples of IODEF encoded Incident data.  The

   examples are provided for illustrative purposes only and do not
   necessarily represent the only (or even the "best") way to encode
   these particular incidents.
