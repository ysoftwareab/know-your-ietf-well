1.  Introduction

   This document introduces an abstract (base) YANG [RFC7950] data model
   [RFC3444] to represent networks and topologies.  The data model is
   divided into two parts.  The first part of the data model defines a
   network data model that enables the definition of network hierarchies
   (i.e. network stacks of networks that are layered on top of each
   other) and to maintain an inventory of nodes contained in a network.
   The second part of the data model augments the basic network data
   model with information to describe topology information.
   Specifically, it adds the concepts of links and termination points to
   describe how nodes in a network are connected to each other.
   Moreover the data model introduces vertical layering relationships
   between networks that can be augmented to cover both network
   inventories and network/service topologies.

   While it would be possible to combine both parts into a single data
   model, the separation facilitates integration of network topology and
   network inventory data models, because it allows to augment network
   inventory information separately and without concern for topology
   into the network data model.

   The data model can be augmented to describe the specifics of
   particular types of networks and topologies.  For example, an
   augmenting data model can provide network node information with
   attributes that are specific to a particular network type.  Examples
   of augmenting models include data models for Layer 2 network
   topologies, Layer 3 network topologies, such as Unicast IGP, IS-IS
   [RFC1195] and OSPF [RFC2328], traffic engineering (TE) data
   [RFC3209], or any of the variety of transport and service topologies.
   Information specific to particular network types will be captured in
   separate, technology-specific data models.

   The basic data models introduced in this document are generic in
   nature and can be applied to many network and service topologies and
   inventories.  The data models allow applications to operate on an
   inventory or topology of any network at a generic level, where the
   specifics of particular inventory/topology types are not required.
   At the same time, where data specific to a network type does comes

   into play and the data model is augmented, the instantiated data
   still adheres to the same structure and is represented in a
   consistent fashion.  This also facilitates the representation of
   network hierarchies and dependencies between different network
   components and network types.

   The abstract (base) network YANG module introduced in this document,
   entitled "ietf-network.yang", contains a list of abstract network
   nodes and defines the concept of network hierarchy (network stack).
   The abstract network node can be augmented in inventory and topology
   data models with inventory and topology specific attributes.  Network
   hierarchy (stack) allows any given network to have one or more
   "supporting networks".  The relationship of the base network data
   model, the inventory data models and the topology data models is
   shown in the following figure (dotted lines in the figure denote
   possible augmentations to models defined in this document).

                Figure 1: The network data model structure

   The network-topology YANG module introduced in this document,
   entitled "ietf-network-topology.yang", defines a generic topology
   data model at its most general level of abstraction.  The module
   defines a topology graph and components from which it is composed:
   nodes, edges and termination points.  Nodes (from the ietf-

   network.yang module) represent graph vertices and links represent
   graph edges.  Nodes also contain termination points that anchor the
   links.  A network can contain multiple topologies, for example
   topologies at different layers and overlay topologies.  The data
   model therefore allows to capture relationships between topologies,
   as well as dependencies between nodes and termination points across
   topologies.  An example of a topology stack is shown in the following
   figure.

               Figure 2: Topology hierarchy (stack) example

   The figure shows three topology levels.  At top, the "Service"
   topology shows relationships between service entities, such as
   service functions in a service chain.  The "L3" topology shows
   network elements at Layer 3 (IP) and the "Optical" topology shows
   network elements at Layer 1.  Service functions in the "Service"
   topology are mapped onto network elements in the "L3" topology, which
   in turn are mapped onto network elements in the "Optical" topology.
   The figure shows two Service Functions (X1 and X3) mapping onto a
   single L3 network element (Y2); this could happen, for example, if
   two service functions reside in the same VM (or server) and share the

   same set of network interfaces.  The figure shows a single "L3"
   network element (Y2) mapped onto multiple "Optical" network elements
   (Z and Z1).  This could happen, for example, if a single IP router
   attaches to multiple Reconfigurable Optical Add/Drop Multiplexers
   (ROADMs) in the optical domain.

   Another example of a service topology stack is shown in the following

                                  L3 Topology

               Figure 3: Topology hierarchy (stack) example

   The figure shows two VPN service topologies (VPN1 and VPN2)
   instantiated over a common L3 topology.  Each VPN service topology is
   mapped onto a subset of nodes from the common L3 topology.

   There are multiple applications for such a data model.  For example,
   within the context of I2RS, nodes within the network can use the data
   model to capture their understanding of the overall network topology
   and expose it to a network controller.  A network controller can then
   use the instantiated topology data to compare and reconcile its own
   view of the network topology with that of the network elements that
   it controls.  Alternatively, nodes within the network could propagate
   this understanding to compare and reconcile this understanding either
   among themselves or with help of a controller.  Beyond the network
   element and the immediate context of I2RS itself, a network

   controller might even use the data model to represent its view of the
   topology that it controls and expose it to applications north of
   itself.  Further use cases that the data model can be applied to are
   described in [I-D.draft-ietf-i2rs-usecase-reqs-summary].

   In this data model, a network is categorized as either system
   controlled or not.  If a network is system controlled, then it is
   automatically populated by the server and represents dynamically
   learned information that can be read from the operational state
   datastore.  The data model can also be used to create or modify
   network topologies that might be associated with an inventory model
   or with an overlay network.  Such a network is not system controlled
   but configured by a client.

   The data model allows a network to refer to a supporting-network,
   supporting-nodes, supporting-links, etc.  The data model also allows
   to layer a network that is configured on top of one that is system
   controlled.  This permits the configuration of overlay networks on
   top of networks that are discovered.  Specifically, this data model
   is structured to support being implemented as part of the ephemeral
   datastore [I-D.draft-ietf-netmod-revised-datastores], defined as
   requirement Ephemeral-REQ-03 in [RFC8242].  This allows network
   topology data that is written, i.e. configured by a client and not
   system controlled, to refer to a dynamically learned data that is
   controlled by the system, not configured by a client.  A simple use
   case might involve creating an overlay network that is supported by
   the dynamically discovered IP routed network topology.  When an
   implementation places written data for this data model in the
   ephemeral data store, then such a network MAY refer to another
   network that is system controlled.

4.  Model Structure Details

4.1.  Base Network Model

   The abstract (base) network data model is defined in the ietf-
   network.yang module.  Its structure is shown in the following figure.
   The notation syntax follows
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netmod-yang-tree-diagrams].


      module: ietf-network
      +--rw networks
         +--rw network* [network-id]
            +--rw network-id            network-id
            +--rw network-types
            +--rw supporting-network* [network-ref]
            |  +--rw network-ref    -> /networks/network/network-id
            +--rw node* [node-id]
               +--rw node-id            node-id
               +--rw supporting-node* [network-ref node-ref]
                  +--rw network-ref    -> ../../../supporting-network/ +
                  |                    network-ref

     Figure 4: The structure of the abstract (base) network data model

   The data model contains a container with a list of networks.  Each
   network is captured in its own list entry, distinguished via a
   network-id.

   A network has a certain type, such as L2, L3, OSPF or IS-IS.  A
   network can even have multiple types simultaneously.  The type, or
   types, are captured underneath the container "network-types".  In
   this module it serves merely as an augmentation target; network-
   specific modules will later introduce new data nodes to represent new

Internet-Draft  draft-ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo-20.txt   December 2017


   network types below this target, i.e. insert them below "network-
   types" by ways of YANG augmentation.

   When a network is of a certain type, it will contain a corresponding
   data node.  Network types SHOULD always be represented using presence
   containers, not leafs of empty type.  This allows the representation
   of hierarchies of network subtypes within the instance information.
   For example, an instance of an OSPF network (which, at the same time,
   is a layer 3 unicast IGP network) would contain underneath "network-
   types" another presence container "l3-unicast-igp-network", which in
   turn would contain a presence container "ospf-network".  Actual
   examples of this pattern can be found in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-i2rs-yang-l3-topology].

   A network can in turn be part of a hierarchy of networks, building on
   top of other networks.  Any such networks are captured in the list
   "supporting-network".  A supporting network is in effect an underlay
   network.

   Furthermore, a network contains an inventory of nodes that are part
   of the network.  The nodes of a network are captured in their own
   list.  Each node is identified relative to its containing network by
   a node-id.

   It should be noted that a node does not exist independently of a
   network; instead it is a part of the network that it is contained in.
   In cases where the same device or entity takes part in multiple
   networks, or at multiple layers of a networking stack, the same
   device or entity will be represented by multiple nodes, one for each
   network.  In other words, the node represents an abstraction of the
   device for the particular network that it a is part of.  To represent
   that the same entity or same device is part of multiple topologies or
   networks, it is possible to create one "physical" network with a list
   of nodes for each of the devices or entities.  This (physical)
   network, respectively the (entities) nodes in that network, can then
   be referred to as underlay network and nodes from the other (logical)
   networks and nodes, respectively.  Note that the data model allows
   for the definition of more than one underlay network (and node),
   allowing for simultaneous representation of layered network and
   service topologies and their physical instantiation.

   Similar to a network, a node can be supported by other nodes, and map
   onto one or more other nodes in an underlay network.  This is
   captured in the list "supporting-node".  The resulting hierarchy of
   nodes allows also for the representation of device stacks, where a
   node at one level is supported by a set of nodes at an underlying
   level.  For example, a "router" node might be supported by a node
   representing a route processor and separate nodes for various line



Clemm, et al.             Expires June 21, 2018                 [Page 9]

   cards and service modules, a virtual router might be supported or
   hosted on a physical device represented by a separate node, and so
   on.

   Network data of a network at a particular layer can come into being
   in one of two ways.  In one way, network data is configured by client
   applications, for example in case of overlay networks that are
   configured by an SDN Controller application.  In another way, it is
   automatically controlled by the system, in case of networks that can
   be discovered.  It is possible for a configured (overlay) network to
   refer to a (discovered) underlay network.

   The revised datastore architecture
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netmod-revised-datastores] is used to account for
   those possibilities.  Specifically, for each network, the origin of
   its data is indicated per the "origin" metadata annotation -
   "intended" for data that was configured by a client application,
   "learned" for data that is discovered.  Network data that is
   discovered is automatically populated as part of the operational
   state datastore.  Network data that is configured is part of the
   configuration and intended datastores, respectively.  Configured
   network data that is actually in effect is in addition reflected in
   the operational state datastore.  Data in the operational state
   datastore will always have complete referential integrity.  Should a
   configured data item (such as a node) have a dangling reference that
   refers to a non-existing data item (such as a supporting node), the
   configured data item will automatically be removed from the
   operational state datastore and thus only appear in the intended
   datastore.  It will be up to the client application (such as an SDN
   controller) to resolve the situation and ensure that the reference to
   the supporting resources is configured properly.

4.2.  Base Network Topology Data Model

   The abstract (base) network topology data model is defined in the
   "ietf-network-topology.yang" module.  It builds on the network data
   model defined in the "ietf-network.yang" module, augmenting it with
   links (defining how nodes are connected) and termination-points
   (which anchor the links and are contained in nodes).  The structure
   of the network topology module is shown in the following figure.  The
   notation syntax follows [I-D.draft-ietf-netmod-yang-tree-diagrams].

   Figure 5: The structure of the abstract (base) network topology data
                                   model

   A node has a list of termination points that are used to terminate
   links.  An example of a termination point might be a physical or
   logical port or, more generally, an interface.

   Like a node, a termination point can in turn be supported by an
   underlying termination point, contained in the supporting node of the
   underlay network.

   A link is identified by a link-id that uniquely identifies the link
   within a given topology.  Links are point-to-point and
   unidirectional.  Accordingly, a link contains a source and a
   destination.  Both source and destination reference a corresponding
   node, as well as a termination point on that node.  Similar to a
   node, a link can map onto one or more links in an underlay topology
   (which are terminated by the corresponding underlay termination
   points).  This is captured in the list "supporting-link".

4.3.  Extending the data model

   In order to derive a data model for a specific type of network, the
   base data model can be extended.  This can be done roughly as
   follows: for the new network type, a new YANG module is introduced.
   In this module, a number of augmentations are defined against the
   network and network-topology YANG modules.

   We start with augmentations against the ietf-network.yang module.
   First, a new network type needs to be defined.  For this, a presence
   container that represents the new network type is defined.  It is
   inserted by means of augmentation below the network-types container.
   Subsequently, data nodes for any network-type specific node
   parameters are defined and augmented into the node list.  The new
   data nodes can be defined as conditional ("when") on the presence of
   the corresponding network type in the containing network.  In cases
   where there are any requirements or restrictions in terms of network
   hierarchies, such as when a network of a new network-type requires a
   specific type of underlay network, it is possible to define
   corresponding constraints as well and augment the supporting-network
   list accordingly.  However, care should be taken to avoid excessive
   definitions of constraints.

   Subsequently, augmentations are defined against ietf-network-
   topology.yang.  Data nodes are defined both for link parameters, as
   well as termination point parameters, that are specific to the new
   network type.  Those data nodes are inserted by way of augmentation
   into the link and termination-point lists, respectively.  Again, data
   nodes can be defined as conditional on the presence of the
   corresponding network-type in the containing network, by adding a
   corresponding "when"-statement.

   It is possible, but not required, to group data nodes for a given
   network-type under a dedicated container.  Doing so introduces
   further structure, but lengthens data node path names.

   In cases where a hierarchy of network types is defined, augmentations
   can in turn be applied against augmenting modules, with the module of
   a more specific network type augmenting the module of a network of a
   more general type.

4.4.  Discussion and selected design decisions

4.4.1.  Container structure

   Rather than maintaining lists in separate containers, the data model
   is kept relatively flat in terms of its containment structure.  Lists
   of nodes, links, termination-points, and supporting-nodes,



Clemm, et al.             Expires June 21, 2018                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft  draft-ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo-20.txt   December 2017


   supporting-links, and supporting-termination-points are not kept in
   separate containers.  Therefore, path identifiers are used to refer
   to specific nodes, be it in management operations or in
   specifications of constraints, can remain relatively compact.  Of
   course, this means there is no separate structure in instance
   information that separates elements of different lists from one
   another.  Such structure is semantically not required, although it
   might enhance human readability in some cases.

4.4.2.  Underlay hierarchies and mappings

   To minimize assumptions of what a particular entity might actually
   represent, mappings between networks, nodes, links, and termination
   points are kept strictly generic.  For example, no assumptions are
   made whether a termination point actually refers to an interface, or
   whether a node refers to a specific "system" or device; the data
   model at this generic level makes no provisions for that.

   Where additional specifics about mappings between upper and lower
   layers are required, those can be captured in augmenting modules.
   For example, to express that a termination point in a particular
   network type maps to an interface, an augmenting module can introduce
   an augmentation to the termination point which introduces a leaf of
   type ifref that references the corresponding interface [RFC7223].
   Similarly, if a node maps to a particular device or network element,
   an augmenting module can augment the node data with a leaf that
   references the network element.

   It is possible for links at one level of a hierarchy to map to
   multiple links at another level of the hierarchy.  For example, a VPN
   topology might model VPN tunnels as links.  Where a VPN tunnel maps
   to a path that is composed of a chain of several links, the link will
   contain a list of those supporting links.  Likewise, it is possible
   for a link at one level of a hierarchy to aggregate a bundle of links
   at another level of the hierarchy.

4.4.3.  Dealing with changes in underlay networks

   It is possible for a network to undergo churn even as other networks
   are layered on top of it.  When a supporting node, link, or
   termination point is deleted, the supporting leafrefs in the overlay
   will be left dangling.  To allow for this possibility, the data model
   makes use of the "require-instance" construct of YANG 1.1 [RFC7950].

   A dangling leafref of a configured object leaves the corresponding
   instance in a state in which it lacks referential integrity,
   rendering it in effect inoperational.  Any corresponding object
   instance is therefore removed from the operational state datastore



Clemm, et al.             Expires June 21, 2018                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft  draft-ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo-20.txt   December 2017


   until the situation has been resolved, i.e. until either the
   supporting object is added to the operational state datastore, or
   until the instance is reconfigured to refer to another object that is
   actually reflected in the operational state datastore.  It does
   remain part of the intended datastore.

   It is the responsibility of the application maintaining the overlay
   to deal with the possibility of churn in the underlay network.  When
   a server receives a request to configure an overlay network, it
   SHOULD validate whether supporting nodes/links/tps refer to nodes in
   the underlay are actually in existence, i.e. nodes which are
   reflected in the operational state datastore.  Configuration requests
   in which supporting nodes/links/tps refer to objects currently not in
   existence SHOULD be rejected.  It is the responsibility of the
   application to update the overlay when a supporting node/link/tp is
   deleted at a later point in time.  For this purpose, an application
   might subscribe to updates when changes to the underlay occur, for
   example using mechanisms defined in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-yang-push].

4.4.4.  Use of groupings

   The data model makes use of groupings, instead of simply defining
   data nodes "in-line".  This makes it easier to include the
   corresponding data nodes in notifications, which then do not need to
   respecify each data node that is to be included.  The tradeoff for
   this is that it makes the specification of constraints more complex,
   because constraints involving data nodes outside the grouping need to
   be specified in conjunction with a "uses" statement where the
   grouping is applied.  This also means that constraints and XPath-
   statements need to be specified in such a way that they navigate
   "down" first and select entire sets of nodes, as opposed to being
   able to simply specify them against individual data nodes.

4.4.5.  Cardinality and directionality of links

   The topology data model includes links that are point-to-point and
   unidirectional.  It does not directly support multipoint and
   bidirectional links.  While this may appear as a limitation, it does
   keep the data model simple, generic, and allows it to very easily be
   subjected to applications that make use of graph algorithms.  Bi-
   directional connections can be represented through pairs of
   unidirectional links.  Multipoint networks can be represented through
   pseudo-nodes (similar to IS-IS, for example).  By introducing
   hierarchies of nodes, with nodes at one level mapping onto a set of
   other nodes at another level, and introducing new links for nodes at
   that level, topologies with connections representing non-point-to-
   point communication patterns can be represented.

Internet-Draft  draft-ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo-20.txt   December 2017


4.4.6.  Multihoming and link aggregation

   Links are terminated by a single termination point, not sets of
   termination points.  Connections involving multihoming or link
   aggregation schemes need to be represented using multiple point-to-
   point links, then defining a link at a higher layer that is supported
   by those individual links.

4.4.7.  Mapping redundancy

   In a hierarchy of networks, there are nodes mapping to nodes, links
   mapping to links, and termination points mapping to termination
   points.  Some of this information is redundant.  Specifically, if the
   link-to-links mapping is known, and the termination points of each
   link are known, termination point mapping information can be derived
   via transitive closure and does not have to be explicitly configured.
   Nonetheless, in order to not constrain applications regarding which
   mappings they want to configure and which should be derived, the data
   model does provide for the option to configure this information
   explicitly.  The data model includes integrity constraints to allow
   for validating for consistency.

4.4.8.  Typing

   A network's network types are represented using a container which
   contains a data node for each of its network types.  A network can
   encompass several types of network simultaneously, hence a container
   is used instead of a case construct, with each network type in turn
   represented by a dedicated presence container itself.  The reason for
   not simply using an empty leaf, or even simpler, do away even with
   the network container and just use a leaf-list of network-type
   instead, is to be able to represent "class hierarchies" of network
   types, with one network type refining the other.  Network-type
   specific containers are to be defined in the network-specific
   modules, augmenting the network-types container.

4.4.9.  Representing the same device in multiple networks

   One common requirement concerns the ability to represent that the
   same device can be part of multiple networks and topologies.
   However, the data model defines a node as relative to the network
   that it is contained in.  The same node cannot be part of multiple
   topologies.  In many cases, a node will be the abstraction of a
   particular device in a network.  To reflect that the same device is
   part of multiple topologies, the following approach might be chosen:
   A new type of network to represent a "physical" (or "device") network
   is introduced, with nodes representing devices.  This network forms

   an underlay network for logical networks above it, with nodes of the
   logical network mapping onto nodes in the physical network.

   This scenario is depicted in the following figure.  It depicts three
   networks with two nodes each.  A physical network P consists of an
   inventory of two nodes, D1 and D2, each representing a device.  A
   second network, X, has a third network, Y, as its underlay.  Both X
   and Y also have the physical network P as underlay.  X1 has both Y1
   and D1 as underlay nodes, while Y1 has D1 as underlay node.
   Likewise, X2 has both Y2 and D2 as underlay nodes, while Y2 has D2 as
   underlay node.  The fact that X1 and Y1 are both instantiated on the
   same physical node D1 can be easily derived.

         Figure 6: Topology hierarchy example - multiple underlays

   In the case of a physical network, nodes represent physical devices
   and termination points physical ports.  It should be noted that it is
   also possible to augment the data model for a physical network-type,
   defining augmentations that have nodes reference system information
   and termination points reference physical interfaces, in order to
   provide a bridge between network and device models.

4.4.10.  Supporting client-configured and system-controlled network
         topology

   YANG requires data nodes to be designated as either configuration
   ("config true") or operational data ("config false"), but not both,
   yet it is important to have all network information, including
   vertical cross-network dependencies, captured in one coherent data
   model.  In most cases, network topology information is discovered
   about a network; the topology is considered a property of the network
   that is reflected in the data model.  That said, certain types of




Clemm, et al.             Expires June 21, 2018                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft  draft-ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo-20.txt   December 2017


   topology need to also be configurable by an application, such as in
   the case of overlay topologies.

   The YANG data model for network topology designates all data as
   "config true".  The distinction between data that is actually
   configured and data that is in effect, including data that is
   discovered about the network, is provided through the datastores
   introduced as part of the Network Management Datastore Architecture,
   NMDA [I-D.draft-ietf-netmod-revised-datastores].  Network topology
   data that is discovered is automatically populated as part of the
   operational state datastore, <operational>.  It is "system
   controlled".  Network topology that is configured is instantiated as
   part of a configuration datastore, e.g. <intended>.  Only when it has
   actually taken effect, it is also instantiated as part of the
   operational state datastore, i.e. <operational>.

   Configured network topology will in general refer to an underlay
   topology and include layering information, such as the supporting
   node(s) underlying a node, supporting link(s) underlying a link, and
   supporting termination point(s) underlying a termination point.  The
   supporting objects must be instantiated in the operational state
   datastore in order for the dependent overlay object to be reflected
   in the operational state datastore.  Should a configured data item
   (such as a node) have a dangling reference that refers to a non-
   existing data item (such as a supporting node), the configured data
   item will automatically be removed from <operational> and show up
   only in <intended>.  It will be up to the client application to
   resolve the situation and ensure that the reference to the supporting
   resources is configured properly.

   For each network, the origin of its data is indicated per the
   "origin" metadata [RFC7952] annotation defined in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netmod-revised-datastores].  In general, the origin
   of discovered network data is "learned"; the origin of configured
   network data is "intended".

4.4.11.  Identifiers of string or URI type

   The current data model defines identifiers of nodes, networks, links,
   and termination points as URIs.  An alternative would define them as
   strings.

   The case for strings is that they will be easier to implement.  The
   reason for choosing URIs is that the topology/node/tp exists in a
   larger context, hence it is useful to be able to correlate
   identifiers across systems.  While strings, being the universal data
   type, are easier for human beings, they also muddle things.  What
   typically happens is that strings have some structure which is



Clemm, et al.             Expires June 21, 2018                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft  draft-ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo-20.txt   December 2017


   magically assigned and the knowledge of this structure has to be
   communicated to each system working with the data.  A URI makes the
   structure explicit and also attaches additional semantics: the URI,
   unlike a free-form string, can be fed into a URI resolver, which can
   point to additional resources associated with the URI.  This property
   is important when the topology data is integrated into a larger, more
   complex system.

5.  Interactions with Other YANG Modules

   The data model makes use of data types that have been defined in
   [RFC6991].

   This is a protocol independent YANG data model with topology
   information.  It is separate from and not linked with data models
   that are used to configure routing protocols or routing information.
   This includes e.g. data model "ietf-routing" [RFC8022].

   The data model obeys the requirements for the ephemeral state found
   in the document [RFC8242].  For ephemeral topology data that is
   system controlled, the process tasked with maintaining topology
   information will load information from the routing process (such as
   OSPF) into the operational state datastore without relying on a
   configuration datastore.

8.  Security Considerations

   The YANG modules defined in this document are designed to be accessed
   via network management protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or
   RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport
   layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure
   Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the
   mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS [RFC5246].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC6536] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   The network topology and inventory created by this module reveals
   information about the structure of networks that could be very
   helpful to an attacker.  As a privacy consideration, while there is
   no personally identifiable information defined in this module, it is

   possible that some node identifiers may be associated with devices
   that are in turn associated with specific users.

   The YANG modules define information that can be configurable in
   certain instances, for example in the case of overlay topologies that
   can be created by client applications.  In such cases, a malicious
   client could introduce topologies that are undesired.  Specifically,
   a malicious client could attempt to remove or add a node, a link, a
   termination point, by creating or deleting corresponding elements in
   the node, link, and termination point lists, respectively.  In the
   case of a topology that is learned, the server will automatically
   prohibit such misconfiguration attempts.  In the case of a topology
   that is configured, i.e. whose origin is "intended", the undesired
   configuration could become effective and be reflected in the
   operational state datastore, leading to disruption of services
   provided via this topology might be disrupted.  For example, the
   topology could be "cut" or be configured in a suboptimal way, leading
   to increased consumption of resources in the underlay network due to
   resulting routing and bandwidth utilization inefficiencies.
   Likewise, it could lead to degradation of service levels as well as
   possibly disruption of service.  For those reasons, it is important
   that the NETCONF access control model is vigorously applied to
   prevent topology misconfiguration by unauthorized clients.

   Specifically, there are a number of data nodes defined in these YANG
   module that are writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true,
   which is the default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive
   or vulnerable in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g.,
   edit-config) to these data nodes without proper protection can have a
   negative effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and
   data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability in the ietf-network
   module:

   o  network: A malicious client could attempt to remove or add a
      network in an attempt to remove an overlay topology, or create an
      unauthorized overlay.

   o  supporting-network: A malicious client could attempt to disrupt
      the logical structure of the model, resulting in lack of overall
      data integrity and making it more difficult to, for example,
      troubleshoot problems rooted in the layering of network
      topologies.

   o  node: A malicious client could attempt to remove or add a node
      from network, for example in order to sabotage the topology of a
      network overlay.

   o  supporting-node: A malicious client could attempt to change the
      supporting-node in order to sabotage the layering of an overlay.

   These are the subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/
   vulnerability in the ietf-network-topology module:

   o  link: A malicious client could attempt to remove a link from a
      topology, or add a new link, or manipulate the way the link is
      layered over supporting links, or modify the source or destination
      of the link.  Either way, the structure of the topology would be
      sabotaged, which could, for example, result in an overlay topology
      that is less than optimal.

   o  termination-point: A malicious client could attempt to remove
      termination points from a node, or add "phantom" termination
      points to a node, or change the layering dependencies of
      termination points, again in an attempt to sabotage the integrity
      of a topology and potentially disrupt orderly operations of an
      overlay.

Appendix A.  Model Use Cases

A.1.  Fetching Topology from a Network Element

   In its simplest form, topology is learned by a network element (e.g.,
   a router) through its participation in peering protocols (IS-IS, BGP,
   etc.).  This learned topology can then be exported (e.g., to a
   Network Management System) for external utilization.  Typically, any
   network element in a domain can be queried for its topology and
   expected to return the same result.

   In a slightly more complex form, the network element may be a
   controller, either by nature of it having satellite or subtended
   devices hanging off of it, or in the more classical sense, such as
   special device designated to orchestrate the activities of a number
   of other devices (e.g., an optical controller).  In this case, the
   controller device is logically a singleton and must be queried
   distinctly.

   It is worth noting that controllers can be built on top of
   controllers to establish a topology incorporating of all the domains
   within an entire network.

   In all of the cases above, the topology learned by the network
   element is considered to be operational state data.  That is, the
   data is accumulated purely by the network element's interactions with
   other systems and is subject to change dynamically without input or
   consent.

A.2.  Modifying TE Topology Imported from an Optical Controller

   Consider a scenario where an Optical Transport Controller presents
   its topology in abstract TE Terms to a Client Packet Controller.
   This Customized Topology (that gets merged into the Client's native
   topology) contains sufficient information for the path computing
   client to select paths across the optical domain according to its
   policies.  If the Client determines (at any given point in time) that
   this imported topology does not exactly cater to its requirements, it
   may decide to request modifications to the topology.  Such
   customization requests may include addition or deletion of
   topological elements or modification of attributes associated with
   existing topological elements.  From the perspective of the Optical
   Controller, these requests translate into configuration changes to
   the exported abstract topology.

Internet-Draft  draft-ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo-20.txt   December 2017


A.3.  Annotating Topology for Local Computation

   In certain scenarios, the topology learned by a controller needs to
   be augmented with additional attributes before running a computation
   algorithm on it.  Consider the case where a path-computation
   application on the controller needs to take the geographic
   coordinates of the nodes into account while computing paths on the
   learned topology.  If the learned topology does not contain these
   coordinates, then these additional attributes must be configured on
   the corresponding topological elements.

A.4.  SDN Controller-Based Configuration of Overlays on Top of Underlays

   In this scenario, an SDN controller (for example, Open Daylight)
   maintains a view of the topology of the network that it controls
   based on information that it discovers from the network.  In
   addition, it provides an application in which it configures and
   maintains an overlay topology.

   The SDN Controller thus maintains two roles:

   o  It is a client to the network.

   o  It is a server to its own northbound applications and clients,
      e.g. an OSS.

   In other words, one system's client (or controller, in this case) may
   be another system's server (or managed system).

   In this scenario, the SDN controller maintains a consolidated data
   model of multiple layers of topology.  This includes the lower layers
   of the network topology, built from information that is discovered
   from the network.  It also includes upper layers of topology overlay,
   configurable by the controller's client, i.e. the OSS.  To the OSS,
   the lower topology layers constitute "read-only" information.  The
   upper topology layers need to be read-writable.

Appendix B.  Companion YANG models for non-NMDA compliant
             implementations

   The YANG modules defined in this document are designed to be used in
   conjunction with implementations that support the Network Management
   Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netmod-revised-datastores].  In order to allow
   implementations to use the data model even in cases when NMDA is not
   supported, in the following two companion modules are defined that
   represent the operational state of networks and network topologies.
   The modules, ietf-network-state and ietf-network-topology-state,

Internet-Draft  draft-ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo-20.txt   December 2017


   mirror modules ietf-network and ietf-network-topology defined earlier
   in this document.  However, all data nodes are non-configurable.
   They represent state that comes into being by either learning
   topology information from the network, or by applying configuration
   from the mirrored modules.

   The companion modules, ietf-network-state and ietf-network-topology-
   state, are redundant and SHOULD NOT be supported by implementations
   that support NMDA.  It is for this reason that the definitions are
   defined in an appendix.

   As the structure of both modules mirrors that of their underlying
   modules, the YANG tree is not depicted separately.

    "This module defines a common base data model for a collection
     of nodes in a network. Node definitions are further used
     in network topologies and inventories.  It represents
     information that is either learned and automatically populated,
     or information that results from applying configured netwok
     information configured per the ietf-network data model,
     mirroring the corresponding data nodes in this data model.

     The data model mirrors ietf-network, but contains only
     read-only state data.  The data model is not needed when the
     underlying implementation infrastructure supports the Network
     Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA).

Appendix C.  An Example

   This section contains an example of an instance data tree in JSON
   encoding [RFC7951].  The example instantiates ietf-network-topology
   (and ietf-network, which ietf-network-topology augments) for the
   topology that is depicted in the following diagram.  There are three
   nodes, D1, D2, and D3.  D1 has three termination points, 1-0-1,
   1-2-1, and 1-3-1.  D2 has three termination points as well, 2-1-1,
   2-0-1, and 2-3-1.  D3 has two termination points, 3-1-1 and 3-2-1.
   In addition there are six links, two between each pair of nodes with
   one going in each direction.
