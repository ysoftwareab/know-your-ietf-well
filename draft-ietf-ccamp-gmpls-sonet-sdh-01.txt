Abstract 
    
   This document is a companion to the Generalized MPLS signaling 
   documents, [GMPLS-SIG], [GMPLS-RSVP] and [GMPLS-LDP].  It defines 
   the SONET/SDH technology specific information needed when using 
   GMPLS signaling. 
    
    
1. Introduction 
    
   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) extends MPLS from supporting packet 
   (Packet Switching Capable - PSC) interfaces and switching to 
   include support of three new classes of interfaces and switching: 
   Time-Division Multiplex (TDM), Lambda Switch (LSC) and Fiber-
   Switch (FSC). A functional description of the extensions to MPLS 
   signaling needed to support the new classes of interfaces and 
   switching is provided in [GMPLS-SIG]. [GMPLS-RSVP] describes RSVP-
   TE specific formats and mechanisms needed to support all four 
   classes of interfaces, and CR-LDP extensions can be found in 
   [GMPLS-LDP]. This document presents details that are specific to 
   SONET/SDH. Per [GMPLS-SIG], SONET/SDH specific parameters are 
   carried in the signaling protocol in traffic parameter specific 
   objects. 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" 
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 
    
    
2. SDH and SONET Traffic Parameters 
    
   This section defines the GMPLS traffic parameters for SONET/SDH. 
   The protocol specific formats, for the SDH/SONET-specific RSVP-TE 
   objects and CR-LDP TLVs are described in sections 2.2 and 2.3 
   respectively. 
    
   These traffic parameters specify indeed a base set of capabilities 
   for SONET (ANSI T1.105) and SDH (ITU-T G.707) such as 
   concatenation and transparency. Other documents could enhance this 
   set of capabilities in the future. For instance, signaling for SDH 
   over PDH (ITU-T G.832), or sub-STM-0 (ITU-T G.708) interfaces 
   could be defined. 
    
   The traffic parameters defined hereafter MUST be used when 
   SONET/SDH is specified in the LSP Encoding Type field of a 
   Generalized Label Request [GMPLS-SIG].

2.1. SONET/SDH Traffic Parameters 
    
      The traffic parameters for SONET/SDH is organized as follows:

   Signal Type (ST): 8 bits 
    
     This field indicates the type of Elementary Signal that 
     comprises the requested LSP. Several transforms can be applied 
     successively on the Elementary Signal to build the Final Signal 
     being actually requested for the LSP. 
      
     Each transform is optional and must be ignored if zero, except 
     MT that cannot be zero and is ignored if equal to one. 
      
     Transforms must be applied strictly in the following order: 
    
      - First, contiguous concatenation (by using the RCC and NCC 
        fields) can be optionally applied on the Elementary Signal, 
        resulting in a contiguously concatenated signal. 
      - Second, virtual concatenation (by using the NVC field) can 
        be optionally applied either directly on the Elementary 
        Signal, or on the contiguously concatenated signal obtained 
        from the previous phase (see Appendix 4). 
      - Third, some transparency can be optionally specified when 
        requesting a frame as signal rather than an SPE or VC based 
        signal (by using the Transparency field). 
      - Fourth, a multiplication (by using the Multiplier field) can be 
        optionally applied either directly on the Elementary Signal, or 
        on the contiguously concatenated signal obtained from the first 
        phase, or on the virtually concatenated signal obtained from 
        the second phase, or on these signals combined with some 
        transparency.

   Permitted Signal Type values for SONET/SDH are: 
    
       Value      Type 
       -----  ----------------- 
        1    VT1.5  SPE / VC-11 
        2    VT2    SPE / VC-12 
        3    VT3    SPE 
        4    VT6    SPE / VC-2 
        5    STS-1  SPE / VC-3 
        6    STS-3c SPE / VC-4 
        7    STS-1      / STM-0   (only when requesting transparency) 
        8    STS-3      / STM-1   (only when requesting transparency) 
        9    STS-12     / STM-4   (only when requesting transparency) 
        10   STS-48     / STM-16  (only when requesting transparency) 
        11   STS-192    / STM-64  (only when requesting transparency) 
        12   STS-768    / STM-256 (only when requesting transparency) 
      
     A dedicated signal type is assigned to a SONET STS-3c SPE instead 
     of coding it as a contiguous concatenation of three STS-1 SPEs. 
     This was done in order to provide easy interworking between SONET 
     and SDH signaling. 
      
     Refer to Appendix 1 and Appendix 2 for an extended set of signal 
     type values beyond the signal types as defined in T1.105/G.707. 
    
   Requested Contiguous Concatenation (RCC): 8 bits 
    
     This field is used to request and negotiate the optional 
     SONET/SDH contiguous concatenation of the Elementary Signal. 
      
     This field is a vector of flags. Each flag indicates the 
     support of a particular type of contiguous concatenation. 
     Several flags can be set at the same time to indicate a choice.  
      
     These flags allow an upstream node to indicate to a downstream 
     node the different types of contiguous concatenation that it 
     supports. However, the downstream node decides which one to use 
     according to its own rules. 
      
     A downstream node receiving such flags chooses, as it likes, a 
     particular type of contiguous concatenation, if any supported. 
     A downstream node that doesnÆt support any of the concatenation 
     types indicated by the field must refuse the LSP request. In 
     particular, it must refuse the LSP request if it doesnÆt 
     support contiguous concatenation at all. 
      
     The upstream node can know which type of contiguous 
     concatenation the downstream node chosen by looking at the 
     position indicated by the first label and the number of 
     label(s) as returned by the downstream node.

     The entire field is set to zero to indicate that no contiguous 
     concatenation is requested at all (default value). A non-zero 
     field indicates that some contiguous concatenation is being 
     requested. 
      
     The following flag is defined: 
      
         Flag 1 (bit 1): Standard contiguous concatenation. 
      
     Flag 1 indicates that only the standard SONET/SDH contiguous 
     concatenation as defined in T1.105/G.707 is supported. Note 
     that bit 1 is the low order bit. Other flags are reserved for 
     extensions, if not used they should be set to zero when sent, 
     and should be ignored when received. 
      
     See note 1 hereafter in the section on the NCC about the SONET 
     contiguous concatenation of STS-1 SPEs when the number of 
     components is a multiple of three. 
      
     Refer to Appendix 3 for an extended set of contiguous 
     concatenation types beyond the contiguous concatenation types as 
     defined in T1.105/G.707. 
 
   Number of Contiguous Components (NCC): 16 bits 
    
     This field indicates the number of identical SONET/SDH SPEs/VCs 
     that are requested to be concatenated, as specified in the RCC 
     field. 
      
     Note 1: when requesting a SONET STS-Nc SPE with N=3*X, the 
     elementary signal to use must always be an STS-3c SPE signal 
     type and the value of NCC must always be equal to X. This 
     allows also facilitating the interworking between SONET and 
     SDH. In particular, it means that the contiguous concatenation 
     of three STS-1 SPEs cannot not be requested because according 
     to this specification, this type of signal must be coded using 
     the STS-3c SPE signal type. 
      
     Note 2: when requesting a transparent STM-N/STS-N signal 
     limited to a single contiguously concatenated VC-4-Nc/STS-Nc-
     SPE, the signal type must be STM-N/STS-N, RCC with flag 1 and 
     NCC set to 1. 
      
     This field is irrelevant if no contiguous concatenation is 
     requested (RCC = 0), in that case it must be set to zero when 
     send, and should be ignored when received. A RCC value 
     different from 0 must imply a number of components greater than 
     1.

   Number of Virtual Components (NVC): 16 bits 
      
     This field indicates the number of signals that are requested 
     to be virtually concatenated. These signals are all of the same 
     type by definition. They are Elementary Signal SPEs/VCs for 
     which signal types are defined. 
      
     This field is set to 0 (default value) to indicate that no 
     virtual concatenation is requested. 
      
     Refer to Appendix 4 for an extended set of signals that can be 
     virtually concatenated beyond the virtual concatenation as defined 
     in T1.105/G.707. 
      
   Multiplier (MT): 16 bits 
      
     This field indicates the number of identical signals that are 
     requested for the LSP, i.e. that form the Final Signal. These 
     signals can be either identical Elementary Signals, or 
     identical contiguously concatenated signals, or identical 
     virtually concatenated signals. Note that all these signals 
     belongs thus to the same LSP. 
      
     The distinction between the components of multiple virtually 
     concatenated signals is done via the order of the labels that 
     are specified in the signaling. The first set of labels must 
     describe the first component (set of individual signals 
     belonging to the first virtual concatenated signal), the second 
     set must describe the second component (set of individual 
     signals belonging to the second virtual concatenated signal) 
     and so on. 
      
     This field is set to one (default value) to indicate that 
     exactly one instance of a signal is being requested. Zero is an 
     invalid value. 
      
   Transparency (T): 32 bits 
    
     This field is a vector of flags that indicates the type of 
     transparency being requested. Several flags can be combined to 
     provide different types of transparency. Not all combinations 
     are necessarily valid. The default value for this field is 
     zero, i.e. no transparency requested. 
      
     Transparency as defined from the point of view of this 
     signaling specification is only applicable to the fields in the 
     SONET/SDH frame overheads. In the SONET case, these are the 
     fields in the Section Overhead (SOH), and the Line Overhead 
     (LOH). In the SDH case, these are the fields in the Regenerator 
     Section Overhead (RSOH), the Multiplex Section overhead (MSOH), 
     and the pointer fields between the two. With SONET, the pointer 
     fields are part of the LOH.

               draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-sonet-sdh-01.txt     June, 2001 

     Note as well that transparency is only applicable when using 
     the following Signal Types: STM-0, STM-1, STM-4, STM-16, STM-
     64, STM-256, STS-1, STS-3, STS-12, STS-48, STS-192, and STS-
     768. At least one transparency type must be specified when 
     requesting such a signal type. 
      
     Transparency indicates precisely which fields in these 
     overheads must be delivered unmodified at the other end of the 
     LSP. An ingress LSR requesting transparency will pass these 
     overhead fields that must be delivered to the egress LSR 
     without any change. From the ingress and egress LSRs point of 
     views, these fields must be seen as unmodified. 
      
     Transparency is not applied at the interfaces with the 
     initiating and terminating LSRs, but is only applied between 
     intermediate LSRs.  
      
     The transparency field is used to request an LSP that supports 
     the requested transparency type; it may also be used to setup 
     the transparency process to be applied in each intermediate 
     LSR. 
      
     The different transparency flags are the following: 
      
        Flag 1 (bit 1): Section/Regenerator Section layer. 
        Flag 2 (bit 2): Line/Multiplex Section layer. 
      
     Where bit 1 is the low order bit. Others flags are reserved, 
     they should be set to zero when sent, and should be ignored 
     when received. A flag is set to one to indicate that the 
     corresponding transparency is requested. 
      
     Section/Regenerator Section layer transparency means that the 
     entire frames must be delivered unmodified. This implies that 
     pointers cannot be adjusted. When using Section/Regenerator 
     Section layer transparency all other flags must be ignored. 
      
     Line/Multiplex Section layer transparency means that the 
     LOH/MSOH must be delivered unmodified. This implies that 
     pointers cannot be adjusted.  
      
     Refer to Appendix 5 for an extended set of transparency types 
     beyond the transparency types as defined in T1.105/G.707. 
      
2.2. RSVP-TE Details 
    
   For RSVP-TE, the SONET/SDH traffic parameters are carried in the 
   SONET/SDH SENDER_TSPEC and FLOWSPEC objects.  The same format is 
   used both for SENDER_TSPEC object and FLOWSPEC objects. The 
   contents of the objects is defined above in Section 2.1. The 
   objects have the following class and type:

               draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-sonet-sdh-01.txt     June, 2001 

     For SONET ANSI T1.105 and SDH ITU-T G.707: 
    
       SONET/SDH SENDER_TSPEC object: Class = 12, C-Type = 4 (TBA) 
       SONET/SDH FLOWSPEC object: Class = 9, C-Type = 4 (TBA) 
    
   There is no Adspec associated with the SONET/SDH SENDER_TSPEC. 
   Either the Adspec is omitted or an int-serv Adspec with the 
   Default General Characterization Parameters and Guaranteed Service 
   fragment is used, see [RFC2210]. 
    
   For a particular sender in a session the contents of the FLOWSPEC 
   object received in a Resv message SHOULD be identical to the 
   contents of the SENDER_TSPEC object received in the corresponding 
   Path message. If the objects do not match, a ResvErr message with 
   a "Traffic Control Error/Bad Flowspec value" error SHOULD be

   For CR-LDP, the SONET/SDH traffic parameters are carried in the 
   SONET/SDH Traffic Parameters TLV.  The contents of the TLV is 
   defined above in Section 2.1. The header of the TLV has the 
   following format: 
    
    0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |U|F|          Type             |      Length                   | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
     The type field indicates either SONET or SDH: 
    
       For SONET ANSI T1.105 : 0xTBA. 
       For SDH ITU-T G.707   : 0xTBA. 
    
 
3. SDH and SONET Labels 
    
   SDH and SONET each define a multiplexing structure, with the SONET 
   multiplex structure being a subset of the SDH multiplex structure. 
   These two structures are trees whose roots are respectively an 
   STM-N or an STS-N; and whose leaves are the signals that can be 
   transported via the time-slots and switched between time-slots, 
   i.e. a VC-x or a VT-x. An SDH/SONET label will identify the exact 
   position of a particular signal in a multiplexing structure. SDH 
   and SONET labels are carried in the Generalized Label per [GMPLS-
   RSVP] and [GMPLS-LDP]. 
    
   These multiplexing structures will be used as naming trees to 
   create unique multiplex entry names or labels. Since the SONET 
   multiplexing structure may be seen as a subset of the SDH 
   multiplexing structure, the same format of label is used for SDH 
   and SONET. As explained in [GMPLS-SIG], a label does not identify

   the "class" to which the label belongs. This is implicitly 
   determined by the link on which the label is used. However, in 
   some cases the encoding specified hereafter can make the direct 
   distinction between SDH and SONET. 
    
   In case of signal concatenation or multiplication, a list of 
   labels can appear in the Label field of a Generalized Label. 
    
   In case of any type of contiguous concatenation, only one label 
   appears in the Label field. That label is the lowest signal of the 
   contiguously concatenated signal. By lowest signal we mean the one 
   having the lowest label when compared as integer values, i.e. the 
   first component signal of the concatenated signal encountered when 
   descending the tree. 
    
   In case of virtual concatenation, the explicit ordered list of all 
   labels in the concatenation is given. Each label indicates a 
   component of the virtually concatenated signal. The order of the 
   labels must reflect the order of the payloads to concatenate (not 
   the physical order of time-slots). The above representation limits 
   virtual concatenation to remain within a single (component) link; 
   it imposes as such a restriction compared to the specification in 
   G.707/T1.105. 
    
   In case of multiplication (i.e. using the multiplier transform), 
   the explicit ordered list of all labels that take part in the 
   Final Signal is given. In case of multiplication of virtually 
   concatenated signals, the first set of labels indicates the first 
   virtually concatenated signal, the second set of labels indicates 
   the second virtually concatenated signal, and so on. The above 
   representation limits multiplication to remain within a single 
   (component) link. 
    
   The format of the label for SDH and/or SONET TDM-LSR link is: 
 
    0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |               S               |   U   |   K   |   L   |   M   | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   For SDH, this is an extension of the numbering scheme defined in 
   G.707 section 7.3, i.e. the (K, L, M) numbering. For SONET, the U 
   and K fields are not significant and must be set to zero. Only the 
   S, L and M fields are significant for SONET and have a similar 
   meaning as for SDH. 
 
   Each letter indicates a possible branch number starting at the 
   parent node in the multiplex structure. Branches are considered as 
   numbered in increasing order, starting from the top of the 
   multiplexing structure. The numbering starts at 1, zero is used to 
   indicate a non-significant field.

   When a field is not significant in a particular context it MUST be 
   set to zero when transmitted, and MUST be ignored when received. 
    
   When hierarchical SDH/SONET LSPs are used, an LSP with a given 
   bandwidth can be used to tunnel lower order LSPs.  The higher 
   order SDH/SONET LSP behaves as a virtual link with a given 
   bandwidth (e.g. VC-3), it may also be used as a Forwarding 
   Adjacency. A lower order SDH/SONET LSP can be established through 
   that higher order LSP. Since a label is local to a (virtual) link, 
   the highest part of that label is non-significant and is set to 
   zero. 
    
   For instance, a VC-3 LSP can be advertised as a forwarding 
   adjacency. In that case all labels allocated between the two ends 
   of that LSP will have S, U and K set to zero, i.e., non-
   significant, while L and M will be used to indicate the signal 
   allocated in that VC-3. 
    
     1. S is the index of a particular AUG-1/STS-1. S=1->N indicates 
     a specific AUG-1/STS-1 inside an STM-N/STS-N multiplex. For 
     example, S=1 indicates the first AUG-1/STS-1, and S=N indicates 
     the last AUG-1/STS-1 of this multiplex. 
    
     2. U is only significant for SDH and must be ignored for SONET. 
     It indicates a specific VC inside a given AUG-1. U=1 indicates a 
     single VC-4, while U=2->4 indicates a specific VC-3 inside the 
     given AUG-1. 
    
     3. K is only significant for SDH VC-4 and must be ignored for 
     SONET and SDH HOVC-3. It indicates a specific branch of a VC-4. 
     K=1 indicates that the VC-4 is not further subdivided and 
     contains a C-4. K=2->4 indicates a specific TUG-3 inside the VC-
     4. K is not significant when the AUG-1 is divided into AU-3s 
     (easy to read and test). 
    
     4. L indicates a specific branch of a TUG-3, VC-3 or STS-1 SPE. 
     It is not significant for an unstructured VC-4 or STS-1 SPE. L=1 
     indicates that the TUG-3/VC-3/STS-1 SPE is not further 
     subdivided and contains a VC-3/C-3 in SDH or the equivalent in 
     SONET. L=2->8 indicates a specific TUG-2/VT Group inside the 
     corresponding higher order signal. 
    
     5. M indicates a specific branch of a TUG-2/VT Group. It is not 
     significant for an unstructured VC-4, TUG-3, VC-3 or STS-1 SPE. 
     M=1 indicates that the TUG-2/VT Group is not further subdivided 
     and contains a VC-2/VT-6 SPE. M=2->3 indicates a specific VT-3 
     inside the corresponding VT Group, these values MUST NOT be used 
     for SDH since there is no equivalent of VT-3 with SDH. M=4->6 
     indicates a specific VC-12/VT-2 SPE inside the corresponding 
     TUG-2/VT Group. M=7->10 indicates a specific VC-11/VT-1.5 SPE 
     inside the corresponding TUG-2/VT Group. Note that M=0 denotes 
     an unstructured VC-4, VC-3 or STS-1 SPE (easy for debugging).

      The M encoding is summarized in the following table: 
    
          M    SDH                          SONET 
         ---------------------------------------------------------- 
          0    unstructured VC-4/VC-3  unstructured STS-1 SPE 
          1    VC-2                    VT-6 
          2    -                       1st VT-3 
          3    -                       2nd VT-3 
          4    1st VC-12               1st VT-2 
          5    2nd VC-12               2nd VT-2 
          6    3rd VC-12               3rd VT-2 
          7    1st VC-11               1st VT-1.5 
          8    2nd VC-11               2nd VT-1.5 
          9    3rd VC-11               3rd VT-1.5 
          10   4th VC-11               4th VT-1.5 
 
   In case of contiguous concatenation, the label that is used is the 
   lowest label of the contiguously concatenated signal as explained 
   before. The higher part of the label indicates where the signal 
   starts and the lowest part is not significant. For instance, when 
   requesting an STS-48c the label is S>0, U=0, K=0, L=0, M=0. 
    
   Examples of labels: 
    
   Example 1: S>0, U=1, K=1, L=0, M=0 
   Denotes the unstructured VC-4 of the Sth AUG-1. 
    
   Example 2: S>0, U=1, K>1, L=1, M=0 
   Denotes the unstructured VC-3 of the Kth-1 TUG-3 of the Sth AUG-1. 
    
   Example 3: S>0, U=0, K=0, L=0, M=0 
   Denotes the unstructured SPE of the Sth STS-1. 
    
   Example 4: S>0, U=0, K=0, L>1, M=1 
   Denotes the VT-6 in the Lth-1 VT Group in the Sth STS-1. 
    
   Example 5: S>0, U=0, K=0, L>1, M=9 
   Denotes the 3rd VT-1.5 in the Lth-1 VT Group in the Sth STS-1.

Appendix 1 - Signal Type Values Extension For Group Signals 
    
   This appendix defines the following optional additional Signal 
   Type values for the Signal Type field of section 2.1: 
    
       Value         Type 
       -----  --------------------- 
        13     VTG      / TUG-2 
        14                TUG-3 
        15     STSG-3   / AUG-1 
        16     STSG-12  / AUG-4 
        17     STSG-48  / AUG-16 
        18     STSG-192 / AUG-64 
        19     STSG-768 / AUG-256 
    
  Administrative Unit Group-Ns (AUG-Ns) and STS Groups-3*Ns (STSG-Ms), 
  are logical objects that are a collection of AU-3s/STS-1 SPEs, AU-
  4s/STS-3c SPEs and/or AU-4-Xcs/STS-3*Xc SPEs (X = 4,16,64,256). 
   
  When used as a signal type this means that all the VC-3s/STS-1_SPEs, 
  VC-4s/STS-3c_SPEs or VC-4-Xcs/STS-3*Xc SPEs in the AU-3s/STS-1 SPEs, 
  AU-4s/STS-3c SPEs or AU-4-Xcs/STS-3*Xc SPEs that comprise the AUG-
  N/STSG-3*N are switched together as one unique signal. 
   
  In addition the structure of the VC-3s/STS-1_SPEs, VC-4s/STS-3c_SPEs 
  or VC-4-Xcs/STS-3*Xc_SPEs in the AUG-N/STSG-3*N are preserved and are 
  allowed to change over the life of an AUG-N/STSG-3*N. 
   
  It is this flexibility in the relationships between the component VCs 
  or SPEs that differentiates this signal from a set of VC-3s/STS-
  1_SPEs, VC-4s/STS-3c_SPEs or VC-4-Xcs/STS-3*Xc_SPEs. Whether the AUG-
  N/STSG-3*N is structured with AU-3s/STS-1 SPEs, AU-4s/STS-3c SPEs 
  and/or AU-4-Xcs/STS-3*Xc SPEs does not need to be specified and is 
  allowed to change over time. The same reasoning applies to TUG-2/VTG 
  and TUG-3 signal types. 
    
  For example an STSG-48 could at one time consist of four STS-12c 
  signals and at another point in time of three STS-12c signals and 
  four STS-3c signals.  
   
  Note that the use of TUG-X, AUG-N and STSG-M as circuit types is not 
  described in ANSI and ITU-T standards. The use of these signal types 
  in the signaling plane is conceptual. 
   
   These signal types are conceptual objects that intend to designate 
   a group of physical objects in the standardized data plane.

Appendix 2 - Signal Type Values Extension For VC-3 
    
   This appendix defines the following optional additional Signal 
   Type value for the Signal Type field of section 2.1: 
    
       Value         Type 
       -----  --------------------- 
        20     "VC-3 via AU-3 at the end" 
    
   According to the G.707 standard a VC-3 in the TU-3/TUG-3/VC-4/AU-4 
   branch of the SDH multiplex cannot be structured in TUG-2s, 
   however a VC-3 in the AU-3 branch can be. In addition, a VC-3 
   could be switched between the two branches if required. 
 
   A VC-3 circuit could be terminated on an ingress interface of an 
   LSR (e.g. forming a VC-3 forwarding adjacency). This LSR could 
   then want to demultiplex this VC-3 and switch internal low order 
   LSPs. For implementation reasons, this could be only possible if 
   the LSR receives the VC-3 in the AU-3 branch. E.g. for an LSR not 
   able to switch internally from a TU-3 branch to an AU-3 branch on 
   its incoming interface before demultiplexing and then switching 
   the content with its switch fabric. 
    
   In that case it is useful to indicate that the VC-3 LSP must be 
   terminated at the end in the AU-3 path instead of the TU-3 path.   
    
   This is achieved by using the "VC-3 via AU-3 at the end" signal 
   type. This information can be used, for instance, by the 
   penultimate LSR to switch an incoming VC-3 received in any branch 
   to the TU-3 branch on the outgoing interface to the destination 
   LSR. 
    
   The "VC-3 via AU-3 at the end" signal type does not imply that the 
   VC-3 must be switched via the AU-3 branch at some other places. 
   The VC-3 signal type indicates that a VC-3 in any branch is 
   suitable.

Appendix 3 - Contiguous Concatenation Extension 
    
   This appendix defines the following optional extension flag for 
   the Requested Contiguous Concatenation (RCC) field of section 2.1: 
    
      Flag 2 (bit 2): Arbitrary contiguous concatenation. 
    
   This flag allows an upstream node to signal to a downstream node 
   that it supports arbitrary contiguous concatenation. This type of 
   concatenation is not defined by ANSI or ITU-T. 
    
   Arbitrary contiguous concatenation allows for any value of X (X 
   less or equal N) in VC-4-Xc/STS-Xc. In addition, it allows the 
   arbitrary contiguous concatenated signal to start at any location 
   (AU-4/STS-1 timeslot) in the STM-N/STS-N signal. 
    
   This flag can be setup together with Flag 1 (Standard Contiguous 
   Concatenation) to give a choice to the downstream node. The 
   resulting type of contiguous concatenation can be different at 
   each hop according to the result of the negotiation.

Appendix 4 - Virtual Concatenation Extension 
    
   This appendix defines the following optional extension for the 
   signals that can be virtually concatenated. 
    
   In addition to the elementary signal types, which can be virtual 
   concatenated as indicated in section 2.1, identical contiguously 
   concatenated signals may be virtual concatenated. In this last 
   case, it allows to request the virtual concatenation of, for 
   instance, several VC-4-4c/STS-12c SPEs, or any VC-4-Xc/STS-Xc SPEs 
   to obtain a VC-4-Xc-Yv/STS-Xc-Yv SPE. 
    
   Note that the standard definition for virtual concatenation allows 
   each virtual concatenation components to travel over diverse 
   paths. Within GMPLS, virtual concatenation components must travel 
   over the same (component) link if they are part of the same LSP. 
   This is due to the way that labels are bound to a (component) 
   link. Note however, that the routing of components on different 
   paths is indeed equivalent to establishing different LSPs, each 
   one having its own route. Several LSPs can be initiated and 
   terminated between the same nodes and their corresponding 
   components can then be associated together. 
 
   In case of virtual concatenation of a contiguously concatenated 
   signal, the same rule as described in section 3 for virtual 
   concatenation applies, except that a component of the virtually 
   concatenated signal is now itself represented by a list of labels 
   because it is concatenated. The first set of labels indicates the 
   first contiguously concatenated signal; the second set of labels 
   indicates the second contiguously concatenated signal, and so on.

Appendix 5 - Transparency Extension 
    
   This appendix defines the following optional extension for the 
   Transparency field of section 2.1. 
    
  Transparency can be requested for a particular SOH/RSOH or 
  MSOH/LOH field in the STM-N/STS-N signal. 
   
  Transparency is not applied at the interfaces of the initiating 
  and terminating LSRs, but is only applied between intermediate 
  LSRs. Moreover, the transparency extensions can be implemented 
  effectively in very different ways, e.g. by forwarding the 
  corresponding overhead bytes untouched, or by tunneling the bytes.  
   
  This specification specifies neither how transparency is achieved; 
  nor the behavior of the signal at the egress of the transparent 
  network during fault conditions at the ingress of the transparent 
  network or within the transparent network; nor network deployment 
  scenarios. The signaling is independent of these considerations. 
   
  When the signaling is used between intermediate nodes it is up to 
  a data plane profile or specification to indicate how transparency 
  is effectively achieved in the data plane. When the signaling is 
  used at the interfaces with the initiating and terminating LSRs it 
  is up to the data plane specification to guarantee compliant 
  behavior to G.707/T1.105 under fault free and fault conditions. 
   
  Note that B1 in the SOH/RSOH is computed over the complete 
  previous frame, if one bit changes, B1 must be re-computed. Note 
  that B2 in the LOH/MSOH is also computed over the complete 
  previous frame, except the SOH/RSOH. 
   
  The different transparency extension flags are the following: 
        
       Flag 3  (bit 3) : J0. 
       Flag 4  (bit 4) : SOH/RSOH DCC (D1-D3). 
       Flag 5  (bit 5) : LOH/MSOH DCC (D4-D12). 
       Flag 6  (bit 6) : LOH/MSOH Extended DCC (D13-D156). 
       Flag 7  (bit 7) : K1/K2. 
       Flag 8  (bit 8) : E1. 
       Flag 9  (bit 9) : F1. 
       Flag 10 (bit 10): E2. 
       Flag 11 (bit 11): B1. 
       Flag 12 (bit 12): B2. 
   
  Line/Multiplex Section layer transparency (refer to section 2.1) 
  can be combined only with any of the following transparency types: 
  J0, SOH/RSOH DCC (D1-D3), E1, F1; and all other transparency flags 
  must be ignored. 
   
  Note that the extended LOH/MSOH DCC (D13-D156) is only applicable 
  to (defined for) STS-768/STM-256.

               draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-sonet-sdh-01.txt     June, 2001 

   If B1 transparency is requested, this means transparency for the bit 
   error supervision functionality provided by the B1. The B1 contains 
   the BIP8 calculated over the previous RS/Section frame of the STM-
   N/STS-N signal at the RS/Section termination source. At the 
   RS/Section termination sink the B1 BIP is compared with the local 
   BIP also calculated over the previous RS/Section frame of the STM-
   N/STS-N. Any difference between the two BIP values is an indication 
   for a bit error that occurred between the termination source and 
   sink. In case of B1 transparency this functionality shall be 
   preserved. This means that a B1 bit error detection as described 
   above performed after the transparent transport (at a RS/Section 
   termination sink) indicates exactly the bit errors that occur 
   between the B1 insertion point (RS/Section termination source) and 
   this point. Any intended changes to the previous RS/Section frame 
   content due to the implementation of the transparency feature (e.g. 
   modifications of the RS/Section overhead, modifications of the 
   payload due to pointer justifications) have to be reflected in the 
   B1 BIP value, it has to be adjusted accordingly. 
    
   If B2 transparency is requested, this means transparency for the bit 
   error supervision functionality provided by the B2. The B2 contains 
   the BIP24*N/BIP8*N calculated over the previous MS/Line frame of the 
   STM-N/STS-N signal at the MS/Line termination source. At the MS/Line 
   termination sink the B2 BIP is compared with the local BIP also 
   calculated over the previous MS/Line frame of the STM-N/STS-N. Any 
   difference between the two BIP values is an indication for a bit 
   error that occurred between the termination source and sink. In case 
   of B2 transparency this functionality shall be preserved. This means 
   that a B2 bit error detection as described above performed after the 
   transparent transport (at a MS/Line termination sink) indicates 
   exactly the bit errors that occur between the B2 insertion point 
   (MS/Line termination source) and this point. Any intended changes to 
   the previous MS/Line frame content due to the implementation of the 
   transparency feature (e.g. modifications of the MS/Line overhead, 
   modifications of the payload due to pointer justifications) have to 
   be reflected in the B2 BIP value, it has to be adjusted accordingly.
