1  Abstract 
   
  This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management 
  Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in 
  the Internet community.  In particular, it describes the textual 
  conventions to be used in the various Pseudo Wire (PW) MIB modules.

2  Introduction 
  This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base 
  (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet 
  community. In particular, it defines Textual Conventions used in 
  IETF PW and PW-related MIBs.

  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, 
  termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are 
  generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol 
  (SNMP). Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined 
  in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo 
  specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is 
  described in STD 58,RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] 
  and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

6  Security Considerations 
   
  This module does not define any management objects. Instead, it 
  defines a set of textual conventions which may be used by other 
  MPLS MIB modules to define management objects. 
   
  Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB 
  modules that define management objects. Therefore, this document 
  has no impact on the security of the Internet. 
   
7  IANA considerations 
   
  IANA is requested to make a MIB OID assignment under the 
  transmission branch, that is, assign the pwStdMIB under

  { transmission TBD }. 
   
  In the future, PWE3 related standards track PW modules should be 
  rooted under the pwStdMIB subtree.  The IANA is requested to manage 
  that namespace.  New assignments can only be made via a Standards 
  Action as specified in [RFC2434]. 
   
  This document also requests IANA to assign { pwStdMIB 1 } to the PW 
  MIB specified in this document.
