1. Introduction 
 
In this document the term "timing" will be used to refer to recovery of 
frequency and/or time (wall-clock). 
 
There is an emerging need to distribute highly accurate time and 
frequency information over IP and over MPLS packet switched networks 
(PSNs).  A variety of applications require time and/or frequency 
information to a precision which existing protocols cannot supply. 
 
Several other groups are working on related issues. For example, the NTP 
Working Group in IETF is working on an upgrade of the long-standing 
Network Time Protocol [RFC1305]. The IEEE has recently revised its 
Precision Time Protocol [IEEE1588]. The ITU-T has defined Synchronous 
Ethernet, a physical layer technology for transfer of frequency across 
native Ethernet [G.8261, G.8262]. 
 
However, none of these efforts are sufficient by themselves to create a 
complete and robust time and frequency transfer ecosystem in the IP and 
MPLS network environment.  The TICTOC (Timing over IP Connections and 
Transmission of Clock) Working Group was created to develop solutions 
that meet the needs of the various applications for timing over packet 
networks. 
 
This draft attempts to define an architecture for a TICTOC system, 
identifying the various functional components, and considering the 
support required from the network in order to assist the timing 
recovery. 
 
   1.1. TICTOC Layers 
    
   The most general TICTOC system can be logically decomposed into two 
   layers, corresponding to the distribution of frequency and time, 
   respectively, carried over the network by a timing protocol as shown 
   in Figure 1.  Examples of such timing protocols include Network Time 
   Protocol (NTP) [RFC1305] and Precision Time Protocol (PTP) 
   [IEEE1588]. 
    
   Specific TICTOC systems may consist of either or both layers.  For 
   example, if time is not required for the application, then only the 
   frequency layer may be present. 
    
   In some cases there may be additional support from the network to 
   assist the timing distribution.  For example, it may be possible to 
   use a physical layer technology such as Synchronous Ethernet to 
   distribute an accurate frequency.  In this case, the timing protocol 
   is only required to distribute time.  Other examples of network 
   support may include specific QoS settings for the timing protocol 
   flow, and routing constraints to ensure an optimum path.

   (PSN), such as IP or MPLS.  This distribution is accomplished by use 
   of a frequency distribution protocol.  The frequency distributed may 
   be derived from an international standard, or may be an arbitrary 
   frequency needed at some remote location.  If the value of the 
   frequency itself is needed, then the output of this module is input 
   to the frequency presentation module that formats the frequency 
   according to application needs.  Note that this format may be numeric 
   prepared for display, or may take analog form and be used for locking 
   or disciplining other analog frequencies.  When time is needed, the 
   frequency information is sent to the time acquisition module. 
    
   Even if the frequency itself is not needed, time acquisition almost 
   always requires a stable frequency reference.  This reference may be 
   acquired from the frequency acquisition layer, or may be obtained via 
   some other means, such as an accurate local frequency reference, or 
   from a non-PSN mechanism for frequency distribution (e.g., GPS, 
   SONET/SDH). 
    
   From the acquired or otherwise available frequency, we may derive 
   arbitrary time (also known as "phase") by mathematical means.  If the 
   frequency reference is traceable to an international standard, then 
   arbitrary time means a sequence of time values that are synchronous 
   with true (wall-clock, UTC) time, but with an arbitrary offset.  The 
   purpose of the time acquisition module is to enable multiple TICTOC 
   clients to share a single offset, and thus to agree as to marking of 
   phase values.  Such marked phases values are all that is required for 
   certain applications, such as where multiple time-aware agents need 
   to interact (e.g., systems employing Time Division Multiple Access 
   systems). 
    
   When the time markings distributed by the time distribution protocol 
   are traceable to an international standard, the TICTOC clients are 
   said to have acquired wall-clock time.  These wall-clock values are 
   formatted for use by the intended application by the time 
   presentation module. 
    
   1.3. TICTOC Functional Modules 
    
   The remainder of this document further subdivides these modules and 
   identifies the sub-modules needed for timing distribution.  Sub-
   modules may require one or more protocols, a set of processing 
   algorithms, and implementations.   
   The frequency acquisition module may be subdivided into the following 
   sub-modules.  Not all need to be present in all implementations. 
      o  local oscillator 
      o  frequency generator (typically a digital synthesizer) 
      o  timestamp generator  
         (not required if packets are sent at constant rate) 
      o  frequency distribution protocol 
      o  frequency acquisition algorithms

         (may include packet selection algorithms, oscillator 
          disciplining and frequency adjustment techniques) 
    
   The time acquisition module may be subdivided into the following 
   additional sub-modules.  Not all need to be present in all 
   implementations. 
      o  time distribution protocol 
      o  ranging algorithms 
      o  clock adjustment techniques 
      o  timestamp generation (already mentioned) 
    
   In addition, various generic modules may be needed, for either 
   frequency distribution, time distribution, or both.  
      o  security 
      o  autodiscovery and master clock selection 
      o  redundancy and fail-over mechanisms 
      o  OAM, synchronization status messaging, and performance 
         monitoring 
      o  network management 
      o  application profiles 
    
   Any timing protocols should operate over the general internet without 
   requiring specific support from the network.  However, when operated 
   over a specific, managed network where support is available, the 
   accuracy of the time and frequency distribution will be enhanced.  
   Examples of network support include: 
      o  path selection and/or self-organization 
      o  network and traffic engineering for optimum transport of timing
         protocols 
      o  service level specifications and QoS settings 
      o  routing considerations 
      o  on-path support, e.g. PTP boundary or transparent clocks

2. Frequency Layer 
 
There are applications that require an accurate frequency reference, but 
do not require knowledge of absolute time.  In addition, it is often 
wise to acquire frequency for applications that require absolute time 
but do not directly use frequency. 
 
TICTOC is concerned with the network frequency transfer using packet 
technology.  Frequency may be transferred across a network using the 
physical layer, such as through the use of a synchronous network 
interface (for example synchronous Ethernet [G.8262]).  The use of the 
physical layer may produce a higher quality frequency reference than 
achievable using packet based network frequency transfer, but is outside 
the scope of this document. 
 
   2.1. Local Oscillator and Frequency Synthesizers 
    
   TICTOC masters and clients both need local sources of frequency.  For 
   masters, this may be provided by high quality Cesium clock with 
   extremely good long term accuracy, or by an atomic clock with 
   somewhat lower accuracy, but which is disciplined by comparison with 
   a better clock (e.g., by GPS). 
    
   Note that a pure frequency master that does not need to know time can 
   be standalone. 
    
   For clients, the local oscillator is usually a quartz crystal 
   oscillators.  Such oscillators may be stable, special cut crystals 
   with double oven and temperature compensation, or lowly inexpensive 
   crystals.  In either case the frequency derived from these 
   oscillators needs to be adjusted by the TICTOC frequency acquisition 
   module.  This adjustment can be electronic (e.g. changing the control 
   voltage of a voltage controlled oscillator). 
    
   However, it is common practice not to directly adjust the physical 
   oscillator, or even to directly use the oscillator's frequency. 
   Instead, a digital synthesizer fed by the oscillator provides the 
   required output frequency.  Changing parameters of the digital 
   synthesizer changes the output frequency in the required way.  It is 
   important for the digital synthesizer not to introduce too much 
   jitter, and for the changing of parameters to be done in such fashion 
   as to minimize transients. 
    
   Disciplining of the local oscillator, or setting the parameters of 
   the digital synthesizer, is based on the arrival times of received 
   frequency distribution protocol packets, and the information 
   contained in them.  When, for whatever reason, frequency distribution 
   packets are not received, the frequency layer is said to be in 
   "holdover mode".  In holdover mode the local oscillator or 
   synthesizer is still used as usual, but it is no longer disciplined

   based on new information from the distribution protocol (although it 
   may still be adapted, if the acquisition module has models that have 
   been trained during periods that the frequency distribution packets 
   were received). 
    
   2.2. Frequency Distribution Protocols 
    
   The protocol used to distribute frequency across the packet network 
   may be the same protocol used for time distribution, or may be an 
   independent protocol.  The important design consideration is that the 
   protocol used is optimized for that purpose, and not compromised by 
   the need to fulfill a dual role. 
    
   Frequency distribution protocols are "one way", i.e. only require 
   information transfer from the master (where the frequency is known) 
   to the client.  In particular, frequency distribution protocols can 
   be broadcast or multicast to many clients, without the master needing 
   to know the client identities.  Frequency distribution protocols may 
   even operate when there is no return path available.  Exceptions to 
   this rule are control messages sent by the client requesting 
   commencing or termination of the frequency distribution service, or 
   changing its parameters (e.g., update rate). 
    
   Frequency distribution protocols can be broadcast, multicast or 
   unicast.  Multicast transmission conserves network bandwidth, while 
   unicast transmission is often more desirable. 
    
   The TICTOC architecture is modular, and not bound to the frequency 
   distribution protocol.  It is possible to use different frequency 
   distribution methods for different applications and environments, 
   e.g. the use of physical layer frequency distribution protocols such 
   as Synchronous Ethernet.  
    
   2.3. Frequency Acquisition Algorithms 
    
   A TICTOC client needs to be able to recover the original timebase (or 
   frequency reference) of the master or server.  In general it achieves 
   this by comparing the arrival rate of packets with the original 
   sending rate. From this it can determine the relationship between the 
   local timebase and the master timebase. 
    
   Observed arrival times of frequency distribution protocol packets are 
   influenced by two phenomena:  
      o  frequency drift of the local oscillator relative to the master
         oscillator (typically caused by temperature and voltage

   The former behavior needs to be tracked and compensated, while the 
   latter needs to be filtered out.  In order to eliminate the effects 
   of PDV, frequency acquisition algorithms perform some sort of 
   averaging and/or filtering, in an attempt to recover the frequency at 
   which packets were sent.  Typically this involves two steps: 
      o  packet selection and discard algorithms 
      o  filtering and control servos to "lock onto" the sending 
         frequency 
    
      2.3.1. Packet Selection and Discard Algorithms 
       
      In the simplest networks all frequency distribution packets 
      received are used by the frequency acquisition algorithms to 
      derive corrections to the local oscillator.  A major problem with 
      frequency acquisition in complex networks is the elimination of 
      frequency distribution packets that, if used by the acquisition 
      algorithms, would degrade the quality of the recovered frequency.  
      Such packets are variously called outliers, falsetickers, etc. 
       
      There are several reasons for such unreliable packets.  First, 
      malfeasants may deliberately inject false packets in order to 
      impair the TICTOC client's frequency recovery.  We will discuss 
      security mechanisms below.  Second, PDV distributions for complex 
      networks can be long tailed, leading to extremely misleading 
      results.  Third, various network degradations, e.g., congestion 
      and reroute events, can lead to bizarre information being 
      received. 
       
      Furthermore, even typical packets may have experienced significant 
      delay variation, making them less suitable for exploitation than 
      the small fraction of packets that may have experienced almost no 
      delay (and thus minimal delay variation).  When there is a 
      significant fraction of packets that experience essentially no 
      delay, it is reasonable to discard all others (assuming that after 
      this decimation the sampling rate is still sufficiently high). 
       
      2.3.2. Filtering and Control Servos 
       
      Since simple averaging would take too long to sufficiently 
      eliminate the stochastic components, by which time the frequency 
      difference between local oscillator and master oscillator would 
      have changed, more efficient "control loops" are employed.  
      Control loops are nonlinear mechanisms, and are thus able to "lock 
      onto" frequencies, rather than simply removing stochastic noise. 
      Conventional control loops include the Phase Locked Loop (PLLs), 
      the Frequency Locked Loops (FLL), and combinations of the two. 
       
      Delay variation effects can be quite complex and traffic 
      dependent. There are obvious effects such as queuing indeterminacy 
      leading to stochastic PDV, and congestion leading to packet loss.

      There are also more subtle effects, for example multiple 
      plesiochronous flows (e.g.  TDM pseudowires) traversing forwarding 
      elements can cause slow "beating" effects, generating low 
      frequency wander that is difficult to eliminate.  Another example 
      is the batch processing effect introduced by some forwarders in 
      which the first of a series of packets experiences greater latency 
      that later packets. 
       
      Modern algorithms attempt to model the time behavior of local 
      oscillator as compared to the master oscillator, and/or the 
      network behavior.  More complex algorithms may attempt blind 
      separation of the contribution of the two effects. 
       
      2.3.3. Server Contribution 
       
      Traditionally the focus on frequency acquisition algorithm design 
      has been on the client.  However it is possible to mitigate some 
      of the aforementioned effects by modulating the packet generation 
      rate of the master.  Thus TICTOC algorithm modules may describe 
      the client and the server components, and may require matching of 
      these algorithms to achieve optimal performance. 
       
      2.3.4. Reference Algorithm 
       
      Current technologies differ in how much of the algorithm is 
      defined.  NTP defines the clock recovery algorithm completely, 
      while PTP only defines the on-the-wire protocol, leaving the clock 
      recovery algorithms undefined.  Ultimately, multiple algorithms 
      may be required to suit different network environments and 
      application requirements. 
       
      Next-generation frequency acquisition algorithms need to be 
      optimized such that network bandwidth consumed by the frequency 
      distribution protocol is minimized.  Furthermore, these algorithms 
      are required to be robust to network degradations such as packet 
      delay, packet loss, packet delay variation (PDV) and infrequent 
      stepwise changes in network traversal latencies (e.g., due to 
      reroute events or network loading changes). 
       
      It may be necessary to specify a reference algorithm for 
      comparison and validation purposes, but the TICTOC architecture 
      will enable vendors to employ proprietary algorithms.  It will 
      also be possible to upgrade the reference algorithm in the future. 
       
   2.4. Frequency Presentation 
    
   In general, the output of the frequency acquisition module needs to 
   be reformatted before use.  In some cases the reference frequency 
   distributed across the network is different from the frequency needed 
   by the local application; in such cases a digital synthesizer can be 
 
 
Frost/O'Donoghue/Dowd    Expires 14 January 2009               [Page 10]

Internet Draft        draft-stein-tictoc-modules-02            July 2008 
 
   employed to convert the acquired frequency to the desired one.  
   Sometimes it is not frequency itself that is required, but a sequence 
   of equally separated times; in such cases the sequence of time 
   "ticks" is generated from the acquired frequency (once again, digital 
   synthesizer is ideal for this). 
    
    
3. Time Layer 
 
In general the time layer is fed accurate frequency from the frequency 
layer.  There are applications that require accurate time, but do not 
need to acquire frequency over the PSN.  For example: 
   o  if the update rate is high and the time resolution required 
      is low 
   o  if highly accurate frequency is available locally 
   o  if frequency is distributed by means external to the PSN 
      (e.g. GPS, LORAN, WWV) 
   o  if frequency is available by means of the network physical 
      layer (e.g.  PoS, SyncE). 
 
In such cases the frequency input in Figure 2 is provided by the 
alternative frequency source, rather than the frequency layer.  The 
TICTOC two layer decomposition is a conceptual one, and may not be 
easily identifiable in all implementations.  For example, when using a 
pure PLL frequency acquisition module, true "frequency" is never 
derived, only relative phase.  Similarly, tracking mechanisms may 
simultaneously model frequency and time, reducing convergence time by 
adjusting both simultaneously, rather than first acquiring frequency, 
and afterwards time.  However, even in these cases the decomposition is 
a useful one. 
 
   3.1. Time Distribution Protocols 
    
   The purpose of the time distribution protocol is to calibrate a 
   sequence of phase events generated by the local oscillator or digital 
   synthesizer, thus converting arbitrary offset phase values into wall-
   clock values.  This is done by sending packets containing timestamps 
   from the master (where the time is known) to the TICTOC client.  In 
   order for the timestamp to accurately indicate the time that the 
   packet was actually injected into the network (rather than some 
   earlier time when the packet was formed, separated by a stochastic 
   time delay from the injection time), the timestamp should be 
   generated by the networking hardware.  When this is not possible, the 
   stochastic delay should be minimized.  The IEEE1588 protocol has a 
   follow-up message, to indicate the actual injection time of the 
   previous packet. 
    
   The timestamp in the time distribution protocol packet indicates the 
   time that the master injected this packet into the network.  On the 
   other hand, the client receives this same packet after the 
 
 
Frost/O'Donoghue/Dowd    Expires 14 January 2009               [Page 11]

Internet Draft        draft-stein-tictoc-modules-02            July 2008 
 
   propagation delay, i.e. the time taken to traverse the packet 
   network.  Were this time to be accurately known, the timestamp could 
   be corrected, and the precise time known.  Estimation of the 
   traversal time is called ranging, and will be discussed below.  The 
   IEEE1588 protocol has an optional mechanism (transparent clocks) 
   whereby forwarding delays, and even individual link delays are 
   measured and compensated, thus leading to precise knowledge of the 
   traversal delay.  However, this mechanism requires upgrading of all 
   intermediate network elements. 
    
   Due to the requirement of traversal delay measurement, time 
   distribution protocols are generally bidirectional, that is, they 
   require a bidirectional channel, require both master and client to 
   send and receive messages, and usually assume symmetric (or known 
   asymmetry) propagation times.  Unlike frequency distribution, time 
   distribution can not be entirely multicast, due to the ranging 
   requirement. 
    
   There are two well-known protocols capable of running over a general-
   purpose packet network, NTP [RFC1305], and IEEE1588 [IEEE1588].  NTP 
   is the product of the IETF, and is currently undergoing revision to 
   version 4.  IEEE1588 is a product of the IEEE Test and Measurement 
   community, and has recently been revised to better accommodate 
   telecommunication applications.  The new version has a profiling 
   mechanism enabling organizations to specify required and prohibited 
   options, ranges and defaults of attribute values, and optional 
   features, while maintaining interoperability. 
    
   The protocol used to transfer the reference frequency across the 
   network may be the same protocol that is used to transfer time.  The 
   overriding design consideration is that frequency and time 
   distribution protocols be optimised for their purpose, and not 
   compromised by the need to fulfill a dual role. 
    
   The TICTOC architecture itself is not bound to a specific time 
   distribution protocol.  It is possible to upgrade, or replace this 
   protocol, for example to improved the quality of the transfer, or to 
   optimize the transfer for a different network environment, without 
   redesigning the entire TICTOC architecture. 
    
   3.2. Ranging 
    
   To transfer time it is necessary to know the time of flight of time 
   of packets from the time server to the client.  The accuracy of time 
   at the client can be no better than the accuracy provide by the 
   ranging mechanism.  Some ranging mechanisms require or can exploit 
   special hardware assistance by intermediate network elements, such as 
   IEEE1588 transparent clocks [IEEE1588].

   A typical ranging mechanism functions by exchanging timestamps 
   between master and client.  For example, the master sends an initial 
   timestamped packet.  When this packet arrives at the client its 
   arrival time (in terms of the local clock) is recorded.  After some 
   amount of time the client sends a response packet back to the master, 
   containing the initial timestamp (in terms of the master clock), and 
   the packet arrival and retransmission times (in terms of the client 
   clock).  When this packet is received by the master a fourth 
   timestamp is generated (in terms of the master clock).  Since the 
   second and third timestamps are both in terms of the client clock, 
   their difference - representing the amount of time the client 
   hesitated between receipt of the initial packet and sending the 
   response packet - is readily computed.  This difference can be 
   subtracted from the difference between the fourth and first 
   timestamps, to yield the sum of propagation times.  Under the 
   assumption of symmetry, the one-way time is half this sum.  Note that 
   since the difference between third and fourth timestamps is short, 
   possible frequency inaccuracy of the client has little deleterious 
   effect. 
    
   Various variations on this basic four-timestamp method are possible.  
   In the three timestamp method the client sends the time difference 
   (e.g., generated by resetting a timer upon packet arrival) rather 
   than the two timestamps.  When symmetry is not a valid assumption, 
   additional information (e.g., ratio or difference between expected 
   propagation delays) can be used to extract the one-way delay. 
    
   Ranging accuracy is reduced by deviation from expected asymmetry in 
   the network.  Mechanisms to avoid asymmetry at the network layer (for 
   example using MPLS RSVP-TE paths, or the use of the peer-to-peer 
   mechanism described in IEEE1588v2 are useful, as is the ability to 
   correct asymmetry in the physical connection through the use of 
   external calibration. 
    
    
   3.3. Time Presentation 
    
   In general, the output of the time acquisition module needs to be 
   reformatted before use.  Formatting includes translation between 
   different representations (e.g., from seconds after a given date to 
   date and time), changing time zones, etc.  When the time needs to be 
   displayed, e.g., on a computer or mobile device, further processing 
   is often required, such as identification of day of week, translation 
   to other calendars (e.g., Hebrew, Islamic, Chinese), conversion 
   between TAI and UTC, and flagging of holidays and special dates.

4. Generic Modules 
 
   4.1. Security Mechanisms 
    
   Time and frequency services are a significant element of network 
   infrastructure, and are critical for certain emerging applications. 
   Hence time and frequency transfer services MUST be protected from 
   being compromised.  The most significant threats are false timing 
   servers distributing purposely misleading timing packets, and man in 
   the middle tampering with valid timing packets.  Both threats would 
   enable a malfeasant to mislead TICTOC clients, and to bring down 
   critical services. 
    
   Based on the aforementioned threats, one can conclude that 
   confidentiality and replay protection are usually not needed (and in 
   many cases not possible), but source authentication and integrity 
   protection are vital.  In general, it is the master that needs to be 
   authenticated to the server, although in certain cases it may be 
   needed to authenticate the client to the master.   
    
   Applying IPsec Authentication Header (AH) mechanisms to all timing 
   packets is not feasible, due to the computational resources consumed 
   by public key cryptography algorithms.  Adoption of IPsec would 
   impact time acquisition accuracy, and would lead to new methods for 
   malfeasants to disrupt the timing distribution protocols by 
   exhausting resources and denial of service from TICTOC clients.  
   Furthermore, certificates used to authenticate packets have lifetimes 
   that must be enforced for secure use.  Certification of time packets 
   themselves can thus lead to circular dependence and to attacks that 
   invalidate valid time packets and substitute invalid ones.  NTP 
   implementations provided an authentication protocol called Autokey.  
   Autokey utilizes public key algorithms to encrypt cookies, symmetric 
   key message digests for integrity, and digital signatures for source 
   authentication. 
    
   Any security mechanism must be designed in such a way that it does 
   not degrade the quality of the time transfer.  Such a mechanism 
   SHOULD also be relatively lightweight, as client restrictions often 
   dictate a low processing and memory footprint, and because the server 
   may have extensive fan-out.  The mechanism also SHOULD not require 
   excessive storage of client state in the master, nor significantly 
   increase bandwidth consumption. 
    
   4.2. Autodiscovery and Master Clock Selection 
    
   The topology of presently deployed synchronization networks is 
   universally manually configured.  This requires manual or management-
   plane configuration of master-client relationships, as well as 
   preconfigured fallback behaviors.  This strategy is workable for SDH 
   networks, where there are a relatively small number of network 
 
 
Frost/O'Donoghue/Dowd    Expires 14 January 2009               [Page 14]

Internet Draft        draft-stein-tictoc-modules-02            July 2008 
 
   elements that require such configuration, and all elements are 
   controlled by a single entity.  In packet switched network scenarios 
   there may be a very large number of independent network elements 
   requiring timing, making automatic mechanisms important.  Such 
   autodiscovery, automatic master selection algorithms, and perhaps 
   control plane protocols to support these features, are important 
   features of the TICTOC architecture. 
    
   There are application scenarios where it is desirable for clocks to 
   advertise their service, and for clients to automatically select a 
   clock with the required accuracy and path characteristics.  The 
   optimum advertising method may depend on the environment and the 
   application.  For example a host may be best served by finding a 
   suitable clock (or set of clocks) through a DHCP parameter, whist a 
   provider edge may find it more convenient to discover the available 
   clock through BGP. 
    
   Once a TICTOC client has discovered potential TICTOC masters, it must 
   choose how to derive its clock from one or more of them.  This choice 
   can be aided using two types of information: 
      o  claims made by the potential masters as to the accuracy of its 
         local clock (see OAM and SSM below) 
      o  analysis of the stability of frequency recovered from the 
         potential masters. 
    
   One tactic that a TICTOC client may employ is to individually choose 
   which master to use based on this information.  Even if statically 
   configured to use a particular master, a client may be allowed to 
   make independent decisions when the master becomes unavailable or 
   sends synchronization status messages indicating a fault condition. 
    
   A second tactic is not to make a hard decision at all, but rather to 
   perform weighted ensemble averaging of frequencies recovered from all 
   available masters.  The weightings, once again, may be based on 
   claims made by the masters or by monitoring of frequency stability. 
    
   Using either tactic, it is important to ensure that "timing loops" 
   are not formed.  A timing loop is an erroneous topology that 
   causeslocking onto frequencies not traceable to a high quality 
   source. Loops are avoided by ensuring that the frequency distribution 
   paths form a tree. 
    
   Yet another method is not to decide on a timing distribution tree at 
   all, but rather to enable self-organization of independently acting 
   intelligent agents.  In such cases the meaning of master and client 
   becomes blurred, as all agents exchange timing information with a 
   subset neighbors that have been discovered.  This method may be 
   driven by timing acquisition algorithms that guarantee global 
   convergence of the timing agents, meaning that over time the average 

 
 
Frost/O'Donoghue/Dowd    Expires 14 January 2009               [Page 15]

Internet Draft        draft-stein-tictoc-modules-02            July 2008 
 
   timing error decreases, although a given agent's error may sometimes 
   increase. 
    
   4.3. Redundancy and Fail-Over Mechanisms 
    
   Since synchronization is a critical function in many network 
   applications, operators conventionally protect it from single points 
   of failure.  Redundant sources of synchronization are normally 
   provisioned, connected via diverse paths to prevent loss of 
   synchronization at the end station. 
    
   This is also required in packet synchronization.  It may be necessary 
   to provision alternative paths, or techniques such as fast re-route 
   to ensure that connection between a time server and client devices is 
   not lost for too long. 
    
   4.4. OAM, SSM, and Performance Monitoring 
    
   In order to ensure continuity and connectivity of the path from the 
   master to the client, and the reverse path when needed, an 
   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance protocol may be needed. 
   When the master sends timing distribution packets at a constant rate, 
   faults are detected by the client after a few interpacket times; when 
   the rate is variable, the problem is detected after a few times the 
   maximum interpacket interval.  However, in either case the master may 
   be unaware of the problem. 
    
   Synchronization Status Messages (SSMs) were traditionally used in TDM 
   networks to indicate the accuracy of the source upon which an 
   incoming TDM link based its timing, and to notify the remote site of 
   clock failures.  Timing distribution protocols generally have similar 
   functions. 
    
   Performance monitoring is important to ensure the proper operation of 
   timing systems, and may be integrated into OAM mechanisms. 
    
   4.5. Network Management 
    
   As for all network infrastructure mechanisms, timing distribution 
   systems SHOULD be managed.  This implies provision of management 
   agents in TICTOC masters and clients, and definition of the 
   appropriate MIBs. 
    
   4.6. Application profiles 
    
   PTP defines the concept of "profiles", defining the attributes and 
   options of the protocol required to support a given application.  The 
   concept is extensible to other timing protocols, to ensure 
   interoperable components of a timing system.

Internet Draft        draft-stein-tictoc-modules-02            July 2008 
 
   Profiles are developed by standards organizations or other industry 
   bodies.  For example, a "Telecom Profile" is currently under 
   definition by the ITU-T.  The TICTOC working group will need to 
   specify the profile for the particular applications under its remit. 
    
    
5. Network Support 
 
   5.1. Path Selection 
    
   In infrastructure applications it may be possible for TICTOC devices 
   to seek co-operation from routing elements to optimize the path 
   through the network in order to obtain a better quality of time and 
   frequency transfer that is possible when the timing distribution 
   protocol operates independent of the network layer. 
    
   At the simplest level this is use of paths that can support the 
   required quality of service, and have the lowest congestion impact. 
   However it is also possible for the network layer to be a proactive 
   partner in the transfer process.  For example paths may be selected 
   that are explicitly chosen to be symmetric, or paths may be selected 
   such that all are capable of supporting physical frequency transfer 
   (for example synchronous Ethernet), or nodes may be selected such 
   that they are all capable of supporting transparent clock. 
    
   In addition to having to deal with degradation of service due to 
   congestion, TICTOC must not add to the problem.  Thus, TICTOC timing 
   distribution protocols MUST be able to act in a TCP friendly way, 
   even at the expense of minor degradation of performance.  In such 
   cases, it may be required for the master to inform the client of the 
   change in operating conditions. 
    
   5.2. Network and Traffic Engineering 
    
   Every network element (e.g. router or switch) in a packet network 
   adds varying amounts of delay to the packet.  This variation is 
   typically correlated to the load on that network element at the time, 
   and especially to the shared load on the output port. 
    
   Therefore, there is some maximum limit on both the traffic load and 
   the number of network elements that a packet timing flow can traverse 
   before being degraded beyond the point at which the recovered time or 
   frequency is outside of the specification for the given application. 
    
   This maximum limit will change depending on: 
      o  stringency of the application requirements 
      o  stability and environment of the local oscillator at the 
         time/frequency client device 
      o  traffic load in the network 
      o  topology of the network

Internet Draft        draft-stein-tictoc-modules-02            July 2008 
 
      o  physical layer aspects of the network. 
    
   When planning a time/frequency distribution service over a managed 
   network, the network planner must take these considerations into 
   account.  These will influence the appropriate locations for the 
   time/frequency servers and any on-path support elements that may be 
   deployed. 
    
   Traffic engineering may be used to control the traffic load in the 
   network on the routes used by the timing flows.  This may help to 
   control the delay variation in the timing flow, and hence improve the 
   performance of the clock recovered by the client. 
    
   5.3. Service Level Specifications and QoS settings 
    
   The traditional approach to specifying network performance has been 
   to define a series of metrics such as packet loss and packet delay 
   variation.  However, these metrics are not good predictors of how a 
   packet timing scheme is going to perform.  For instance, the packet 
   delay variation metric is too abstract, since it doesn't take into 
   account the distribution of delays, or the correlation of delays over 
   a longer interval. 
    
   Recent research has examined the application to PDV of new metrics 
   borrowed from synchronization standards such as TDEV and a modified 
   version called minTDEV [minTDEV].  The goal is to define a metric 
   that is both measurable and capable of continuous monitoring.  This 
   can then form the basis of a service level specification for a 
   network capable of running time/frequency distribution to a given 
   performance level. 
    
   Further, the network operator needs to know how to tune the network 
   to stay within the specified limit, since no operator is going to 
   sign up to a service level specification that he has no control over.  
   Appropriate QoS settings and techniques must be deployed to ensure 
   the timing packets are forwarded through the routers in the optimum 
   way. 
    
   5.4. Routing considerations 
    
   The basic method for calculating a time offset of a remote slave 
   connected over a packet network makes an assumption that the network 
   delays in each direction are the same.  Any asymmetry between the 
   forward and reverse directions yields an error in the time offset 
   estimation. 
    
   While there may be various inferences that an algorithm can make 
   concerning the size of that asymmetry, there are no currently known 
   techniques for directly calculating its magnitude.  Therefore it is 
   important that the routing is constrained to make the packet flow

   take the same path in each direction.  This in itself will not 
   guarantee that the time delay is the same in each direction, but it 
   should minimize any difference. 
    
   5.5. On-path Support 
    
   The TICTOC architecture will be commensurate with the public 
   Internet, and the timing distribution protocol chosen will be able to 
   function over general packet switched networks. 
    
   In some cases on-path support (for example IEEE1588 transparent 
   clocks) may be needed in order to obtain the required frequency or 
   time accuracy.  Such on-path support cannot be expected to be 
   universally available over the public Internet, and it is not a goal 
   of the TICTOC working group to propose augmentation of basic 
   forwarding elements.  However, such on-path support may be provided 
   on service provider or enterprise networks, and in such cases TICTOC 
   protocols should be able to exploit it. 
    
   In networks with on-path support, it may be that the optimum path for 
   time transfer is not congruent with the optimum path for data 
   transfer.  By using special-purpose IP addresses, and making routing 
   aware of the required path characteristics and address attributes, it 
   is possible to construct paths within the network that maintain the 
   required time transfer characteristics. 
    
   The TICTOC Working Group will specify the required path 
   characteristics and work with the ISIS and OSPF Working Groups to 
   specify the necessary routing extensions to support these 
   requirements. 
    
   TICTOC traffic may need to traverse NATs and firewalls.
