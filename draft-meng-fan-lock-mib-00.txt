1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects used for monitoring locks
   on a device acquired or released by NETCONF and COPS-PR entities.

   The Network Configuration Protocol defined in RFC 4741 [RFC4741]
   provides mechanisms to install, manipulate, and delete the
   configuration of network devices.  It provides global lock mechanism
   via lock and unlock operations for allowing only one session at a
   time to make a change to configuration datastore.  However,
   [draft-ietf-netconf-partial-lock] defines partial lock mechanism as a
   capability to extending base NETCONF for allowing multiple sessions
   to be able to modify the configuration of a managed device in
   parallel.

   The primary purpose of this MIB module is to allow operators to
   monitor NETCONF locks and understand how they might be impacting the
   operation of the device and the network.  A customer might be using
   applications that manage a particular type of functionality.  For
   example, those applications might use SNMP to configure firewalls,
   but an operator applying a Netconf lock to the firewall might prevent
   SNMP from configuring the firewall.  We want to make it possible for
   the operator to determine why the firewall is not getting configured
   on a timely basis.

   COPS usage for Policy Provisioning (COPS-PR) defined in RFC 3084
   [RFC3084] provides mechanisms and conventions used to communicate
   provisioned information (QoS, Security policy,etc.) between PEPs and
   PDPs.

   Between PEP and PDP, there is a single connection per Client-Type for
   a given area of policy (e.g., QoS)so at a given time there must be
   only one server updates a particular policy configuration.  Such a
   policy configuration is effectively locked.

   COPS-PR can be used for many types of provisioning policies, such as
   QoS policy in a Differentiated Services (DiffServ) environment,
   security policy in a firewall filtering policy provisioning
   environment, etc.

   COPS-PR uses locks and may co-exist with other NM interfaces, such as
   Netconf, SNMP and proprietary CLIs, and they might affect each other,
   so it should be included in this MIB module.

   Now this MIB module only contains common managed objects for generic
   lock and specific managed objects for NETCONF and COPS-PR locks.  If

   a device wants to support any other locks, this module SHALL be
   extended to contain more appropriate objects.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   The primary purpose of this mib module is to allow operators to
   monitor locks and understand how they might be impacting the
   operation of the device and the network.  With such a MIB module,
   SNMP could be used to monitor locks set by NETCONF, COPS-PR (or by
   other protocols).If an entity's certain area of data is locked by a
   protocol,there must be a corresponding operation to add the
   information of this lock into this MIB module ,this memo leaves such
   as implementation specific.

   It will be useful for a SNMP operator that retrieving particular
   information of active locks before sending SET request.  If there is
   any lock that intersects the requested objects, the operator could
   know how the SET request would be impacted by locks, e.g., the SET
   request would be delayed or denied by locks.

   When a (partial) system is locked, SNMP entity should not be
   permitted a SET request on the locked objects.  If the device
   determines that all or a portion of requested objects is locked, it
   should probably response an error to the operator letting him know
   that the SET request could not be completed because certain network
   management entity has locked the relevant resources.  This error
   should be "resource unavailable (13)" defined in [RFC3416].

Internet-Draft    Definitions of MOs for lock via NMps     February 2009


4.1.  Main lock Table

   There is common information for all locks via any network management
   protocol.  Lock Table, which contains entries for all locks, includes
   common information of locks such as the protocol by which a lock is
   acquired, the principal who own a lock, and duration the lock last,
   etc.  This table exists on devices that can be managed and configured
   via SNMP, NETCONF or others protocols.

   This mib module also defines an object named
   lockNMInterfacesSupported to represent which NM interface locks are
   tracked.  For example, without this indication, if there are no
   cops-pr locks in the main table, it may due to cops-pr is not
   supported on the device, cops-pr locks are not monitored or just that
   there are no active locks.  By providing an object that says which
   interfaces are monitored for locks, an operator can better assess the
   lock status of the device.

4.1.1.  Specific NM interface lock Table

   Now there is only two specific NM interface locks to be tracked.
   There might be some other lock tables for specific NM interfaces in
   the future.

   This lockNetconftable provides information on each lock instance set
   by Netconf NM interface in main table.

   The lockCopsPrTable provides specific information on each lock
   instance set by COPS-PR NM interface in main table.

4.1.1.1.  Netconf lock table

   The netconf table represents the specific information of locks via
   NETCONF, including the sessions who own a lock, the lock ID, the
   datastore affected (running/candidate/startup/etc.), and the scope of
   the lock, etc.

   There is an object named lockNetconfModified for indicating the
   candidate datastore is changed or not.  It is useful to have a flag
   for modified/unmodified status of the locked objects.  Once locked,
   it remains unmodified until somebody changes the data.  Once
   committed, it is clean again.  This could be useful information for
   somebody considering forcing an unlock operation.

   It could also be useful for an operator to understand that a device
   is in the process of active maintenance (its config is likely to
   change soon).  For example, if the lock owner is authorized to make
   such changes, the operator can probably ignore SNMP interface up/down

   traps if there is an active lock on the interface configurations.
   Also a security manager might take interest when security
   configuration information is being modified.

4.1.1.2.  COPS-PR lock table

   The COPS-PR lock table represents the specific information of locks
   via COPS-PR, including the area of the policy provisioning identified
   by the client-type, policies being installed, policies being removed
   and policies being updated, etc.

   There is an object named lockCopsPrModified for indicating the policy
   is modified or not.  It is a useful flag as described in the
   lockNetconfModified object.

4.1.2.  Statistics

   This mib module defines some statistic objects to keep track of the
   number of current active locks, failed locks.

   SNMP applications often retrieve the values of counters periodically
   in order to detect unusual conditions occurring.  These statistic
   objects can help to warn about anomalous behavior.

   If the number of locks grows suddenly or locks keep getting set for
   long periods of time, this could be a security problem, e.g. somebody
   could be trying to cause a denial of service.  Keeping track of the
   number of active locks can help to uncover this.

   If the number of lock failures is unusual, an attacker might be
   trying to lock things they are not authorized to lock.  Or to lock as
   much as they can get away with, and they need to keep trying
   different expressions to see what works.  The counter for
   lockFailures could help uncover this behavior.

4.2.  MIB References

   The following MIB module has IMPORTS from [RFC2578], [RFC2579],
   [RFC2580], [RFC3411].  In REFERENCE clauses, it also refers to
   [RFC2748],[RFC4741] and [draft-ietf-netconf-partial-lock].

4.4.  Security Considerations

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   The readable objects in this MIB module are not sensitive.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),



Meng & Fan               Expires August 31, 2009               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft    Definitions of MOs for lock via NMps     February 2009


   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

4.5.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:


                 Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
                 ----------        -----------------------
                  lockMIB              { mib-2 XXX }

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.

4.6.  Acknowledgments

   Many thanks to David Harrington for his guidance and feedback on this
   MIB module.
