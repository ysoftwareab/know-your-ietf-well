     1. Introduction 

        This memo is a product of the DHCP Working Group and defines a 
        portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network 
        management protocols in the Internet community.  In particular, it 
        describes a set of extensions that DHCPv4 and Bootstrap Protocol 
        (BOOTP) servers implement.  Many implementations support both DHCPv4 
        and BOOTP within a single server and hence this memo describes the 
        MIB for both DHCPv4 and BOOTP servers. 

        This memo does not cover DHCPv4/BOOTP client nor relay agent MIB 
        extensions:  these are possibly the subjects of future investigation 
        [see discussion in section 3.1.]  Also excluded from this MIB 
        extension in the interest of simplicity are DHCP Dynamic DNS 
        Updating, Failover, Authentication, and Load Balancing:  these 
        functions and features could be subjects of future MIB extensions.

        Provision is also made for Standards-Track additions to the DHCP 
        Message Type (option 61.) 

        This memo is based on the Internet-standard Network Management 
        Framework as defined by documents [RFC2578, RFC2579, RFC2580]. 

        Objects defined in this MIB allow access to and control of DHCP 
        Server Software.  Servers MAY also provide additional management 
        capabilities using the Applications MIB [RFC2287]. 

        The key words "MUST," "MUST NOT," "REQUIRED," "SHALL," "SHALL NOT," 
        "SHOULD," "SHOULD NOT," "RECOMMENDED,"  "MAY," and "OPTIONAL" in this 
        document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 


     2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework 

        For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current 
        Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of 
        RFC 3410 [RFC3410].Managed objects are accessed via a virtual 
        information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  
        MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network 
        Management Protocol (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using the 
        mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).  
        This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, 
        which is described in STD 58, [RFC2578], STD 58, [RFC2579] and STD 
        58, [RFC2580]. 


     3. Overview 

        In the tradition of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), 
        the minimum number of objects possible is defined in this MIB, while 
        still providing as rich a set of management information as possible.  
        An object is left out of this MIB when it can be derived from other 
        objects that are provided.  Further to the tradition of the SNMP, 
        computationally intense operations are left to the domain of the 
        management station.  Thus, this MIB provides a set of objects from 
        which other management information may be derived. 

        Provision for future extensions to cover DHCPv4 clients and relay 
        agents, and DHCPv6 extensions are implied by the top-level structure 
        illustrated in section 3.1.1. 

        The examples provided in sections 3.3 through 3.5 are not meant to be 
        comprehensive but are illustrative of the potential uses of the 
        objects defined by this MIB.

     3.1. Relationship to Other MIBs 


     3.1.1. DHCP MIB Extensions 

        The DHCP MIB extensions will be the "dhcp" branch of the standard 
        MIB-2 tree, as illustrated by the following diagram: 

          +-------+ 
          | MIB-2 | 
          +---+---+ 
              | 
              | 
          +---+---+ 
          |  dhcp | 
          +---+---+ 
              | 
              | 
              +--------------+---------------+----------------+ 
              |              |               |                | 
        +-----+-----+  +-----+----+  +-------+-------+  +-----+-----+ 
        |  dhcp-v4  |  |  dhcp-v4 |  |    dhcp-v4    |  |dhcp-v6 MIB| 
        |Server MIB |  |Client MIB|  |Relay Agent MIB|  |Extensions | 
        |(this memo)|  | (future) |  | (future work) |  | (future)  | 
        +-----------+  +----------+  +---------------+  +-----------+ 
         

        The DHCP MIBs will share a common branching point but will be 
        independently defined by individual memos. 


     3.1.2. Host System MIB Extensions 

        The Host System MIB [RFC1123] provides for information, command, and 
        control of the host computer system on which a DHCP server resides.  
        The DHCP Server MIB specifically does not include any objects that 
        may be accessible using the Host System MIB. 


     3.1.3. DHCP Client MIB Extensions 

        Development of this set of MIB extensions is a natural path given the 
        increasing interest in desktop and client system management.  It will 
        share a common branch point in the MIB tree with the other DHCP MIB 
        Extensions, and may use many of the same textual conventions.

     Internet Draft             DHCP Server MIB                March 2003 
      
     3.1.4. DHCP Relay Agent MIB Extensions 

        If this set of MIB extensions is ever developed, it will share a 
        common branch point in the MIB tree with the other DHCP MIB 
        Extensions, and will use many of the same textual conventions. 


     3.1.5. DHCPv6 MIB Extensions 

        If this set of MIB extensions is ever developed, it will share a 
        common branch point in the MIB tree with the other DHCP MIB 
        Extensions, and will likely use very different textual conventions as 
        the protocol differs significantly from DHCPv4. 


     3.2. Textual Conventions Introduced in this MIB 

        Several conceptual data types have been introduced as textual 
        conventions in this DHCP MIB document.  These additions will 
        facilitate the common understanding of information used by the DHCP 
        server.  No changes to the SMI or the SNMP are necessary to support 
        these conventions. 


     3.2.1. DhcpTimeInterval 

        This data type measures time intervals since the beginning of some 
        epoch, measured in milliseconds.  DhcpTimeInterval is intended 
        exclusively for use in various statistics, such as in the subtrees 
        "bootpOptionalStatistics" and "dhcpv4OptionalStatistics." 


     3.2.2. DhcpPhysicalAddress 

        This data type contains the type of hardware address represented by 
        MacAddress, as defined for ARP messages. 

        The length in octets of MacAddress is contained in this type. 

        The actual layer 1 hardware address is contained in this data type. 


     3.3. BOOTP and DHCP Counter Groups 

        This section describes some of the management information that may be 
        derived from the objects provided in the counter groups. 

        The total number of valid DHCP packets received by the server is 
        computed as the sum of the "dhcpv4CountDiscovers," 
        "dhcpv4CountRequests," "dhcpv4CountReleases," "dhcpv4CountDeclines," 
      
     Hibbs & Waters       Expires: Mar 2003 + 6 months            [Page 5] 











     Internet Draft             DHCP Server MIB                March 2003 
      
        "dhcpv4CountInforms," and "dhcpv4CountLeaseQueries objects."  The 
        total number of valid packets (BOOTP and DHCP) received is computed 
        as the total number of valid DHCP packets plus the value of the 
        "bootpCountRequests" object.  The total number of packets received is 
        computed as the total number of valid packets plus the sum of 
        "bootpCountInvalids" and "dhcpv4CountInvalids." 

        Similar to the received computations, the total number of DHCP 
        packets sent by the server is computed as the sum of the 
        "dhcpv4CountOffers," "dhcpv4CountAcks," "dhcpv4CountNacks," 
        "dhcpv4CountForcedRenews," "dhcpv4CountKnowns," 
        "dhcpv4CountUnknowns," "dhcpv4CountActives," and 
        "dhcpv4CountUnimplemented" objects.  The number of packets (BOOTP and 
        DHCP) sent by the server is computed as the total number of DHCP 
        packets sent plus the value of the "bootpCountReplies" object. 


     3.4. BOOTP and DHCP Optional Statistics Group 

        This section describes some of the management information that may be 
        derived from the objects provided in the optional statistics group. 

        Given time 1 (t1) and time 2 (t2) greater than t1, the mean inter-
        arrival time of valid DHCP messages for the interval t1 to t2 can be 
        computed as (dhcpv4StatLastArrivalTime at t2 minus 
        dhcpv4StatLastArrivalTime at t1) divided by (valid DHCP received 
        packet count at t2 minus valid DHCP received packet count at t1). 

        Under the simplifying assumption that the capture of packet counts 
        and times is discontinuous (that is, for the measurement interval the 
        captured data represents the complete set for the server) the 
        variance of the mean may be computed as 
        (dhcpv4StatSumSquaresArrivalTime at t2 less 
        dhcpv4StatSumSquaresArrivalTime at t1) divided by (valid DHCP 
        received packet count at t2 less valid DHCP received packet count at 
        t1).  Standard deviation of the mean is the square root of the 
        variance. 

        Calculation of statistics for message response time is entirely 
        similar to the calculations for inter-arrival time, except that the 
        response time objects are used for the calculations. 

        Calculation of statistics for BOOTP is similar to the calculations 
        for DHCP, except that the similar objects from the 
        bootpOptionalStatistics group are used instead of the objects from 
        dhcpv4OptionalStatistics group, server Configuration Group 

        The server configuration group contains objects that describe the 
        configuration information that is contained in the server.  Some of 
        the configuration information is static (e.g., a statically 
      
     Hibbs & Waters       Expires: Mar 2003 + 6 months            [Page 6] 











     Internet Draft             DHCP Server MIB                March 2003 
      
        configured IP address) and some of the configuration is dynamic 
        (e.g., an assigned DHCP lease).  The intent of the server 
        configuration group is to be able to read the server's configuration.  
        Mechanisms outside of the SNMP are currently in use (e.g., vendor 
        defined solutions) and are being standardized (e.g., the Directory 
        Enabled Networks [DEN] initiative) to update a server's 
        configuration. 

        The configuration information defines a minimal set of information 
        that most servers should be able to provide.  Each row of the 
        dhcpv4ServerSubnetTable lists the subnet, the subnet mask, and the 
        subnet that is equivalent to this subnet.  Equivalence is defined as 
        more than one subnet being present on the same network segment as 
        some other subnet. 

        The dhcpv4ServerRangeTable lists the start and end IP addresses of 
        the ranges and the subnet of which the range is a member.  The 
        dhcpv4ServerRangeInUse object indicates the amount of the range that 
        is currently in use, either through dynamic allocation or being 
        reserved.  The range size can be computed by taking the difference of 
        the "dhcpv4ServerRangeStartAddress" and "dhcpv4ServerRangeEndAddress" 
        objects. 

        The dhcpv4ServerAddressTable provides information about the static 
        and dynamic addresses that the server contains in its configuration.  
        Addresses may be: 

          o Static, in which case they are predefined though the server's 
            configuration.  Static addresses may or may not have been 
            previously served by the server; 

          o Dynamic, in which case the server has served the addresses and 
            it is currently in active use by a host; 

          o Expired, in which case the server had previously assigned for 
            which the lease time has expired, but is retained by the server 
            for possible future use by the same client; 

          o Configuration-reserved, in which case the address is not 
            available for the server to allocate to a client.  A 
            configuration-reserved address is one that has been reserved by 
            the administrator.  An example of a configuration-reserved 
            address is an address that is assigned to a client, not through 
            DHCP (e.g., statically assigned), and the address is within a 
            DHCP range; and 

          o Server-reserved, in which case the server has taken the address 
            out of use.  Examples of server-reserved addresses are those 
            that have been declined (i.e., through a DHCPDECLINE) by a

            client or those that have responded to an ICMP echo before they 
            were assigned. 

        The protocol used to allocate the address may be determined from the 
        "dhcpv4ServerAddressServedProtocol" object.  This object indicates 
        whether the address has never been served, or whether BOOTP or DHCP 
        was used to allocate the address. 


     3.5. Response Times and ICMP Echo 

        According to [RFC2131], servers SHOULD try to determine if an address 
        is in use before assigning it.  Some servers choose not to perform 
        this check, letting the client determine for itself if the address is 
        in use.  Other servers perform an ICMP echo (Ping) just prior to 
        assigning an address.  Servers that perform a Ping before responding 
        to a DHCPDISCOVER should not include in the response time the time 
        from when the Ping was transmitted until the time that either a 
        response was received or that the server timed out waiting for a 
        response.

     6. Notes 

        This section will be removed when this memo goes to Working Group 
        Last Call. 


     6.1. Issues 

        Not all of these issues have been resolved, even in the latest (-08) 
        draft.  Some may become items for future study, while some will 
        probably be dropped. 

       o Ryan Troll proposed four or five traps that Nathan Lane 
          enthusiastically supported, but it has been difficult to achieve 
          any consensus (or, for that matter, much interest) in them. 

       o What is the best way to reset counters and statistics?  Is it 
          necessary to reset them at all?  The -08 draft does not declare any 
          counters as read-write or read-create, primarily to avoid these 
          questions, as well as to provide fundamental security over objects. 

       o -- Do we need to reset them individually, as groups, or as a whole? 

       o -- Do we need a timestamp of when they were reset?

     Internet Draft             DHCP Server MIB                March 2003 
      
       o Should all invalid packets received be collapsed into a single 
          counter for each protocol type (BOOTP and DHCPv4), or broken out by 
          type of error? 

       o If counted by error type, what is the set of errors that we should 
          use? 

       o Perhaps we should develop a common vocabulary (and glossary) for 
          terms such as "abandoned" so that the objects defined and 
          implementers don't misinterpret their descriptions. 

       o Do we need to be concerned about the potential size of some of the 
          configuration data tables?  Wouldn't it be better to maintain 
          counters for things like number of leases assigned than to expect 
          the management station to calculate the values by reading very 
          large tables to count the number of leases in that state? 

       o The dhcpv4ServerSystemObjects, dhcpv4OptionalStatistics, 
          dhcpv4ServerClientObjects, dhcpv4ServerNotifyObjects, and 
          dhcpv4ServerNotifications groups may be sufficiently generic that 
          they could be renamed, re-specified, and moved from the 
          dhcpv4Server subtree to the dhcp subtree.  This warrants some 
          discussion, especially if there is interest in client and relay 
          agent MIBs, or in adding extensions to support DHCPv6. 


     6.2. Changes from Prior Drafts 

        The "-01" revision removed the Server Identity section from the 
        proposed MIB, relying on the Application MIB to accomplish the same 
        result. 

        The "-02" revision changed the min/max (inter-arrival and response 
        times) to Unsigned32 so that they could be reset.  Sums of inter-
        arrival and response times were deleted since the management station 
        can easily calculate them.  The last arrival time objects were added. 

        The "-03" version incorporated the proposed configuration tables 
        suggested by Ryan Troll of CMU.  The "01" revision of this version 
        added three elements to the server subnet table, number of 
        outstanding offers, number of addresses in use, and number of free 
        addresses, as well as changing subnet address to subnet mask in the 
        server address, server range, and client address tables.  The client 
        MAC address element of the client address table was separated into a 
        1-octet hardware type and a 16-octet client hardware address, causing 
        a renumbering of the elements in this table.  Clarifying text was 
        added to several element descriptions, and limitations on values, and 
        the reported value when the server did not support the data element 
        were also specified.  This version also incorporated an address

     Internet Draft             DHCP Server MIB                March 2003 
      
        change for one of the authors, revisions to standard text required by 
        the IETF, and some editorial clarifications. 

        The "-04" version changed the maximum size of the object 
        dhcpv4ServerAddressHostName from 64 to 255 octets, and added 
        clarifying text to both that object and to 
        dhcpv4ServerAddressDomainName regarding the practical values for the 
        length of both objects. 

        The "-05" version added a number of traps suggested by Kim Kinnear, 
        made a number of small renaming and renumbering changes (annotated in 
        the MIB itself) and added the Shared Network concept to describe 
        shared network segments: several subnetworks that coexist on one 
        medium.  This was done partly because the Address Range concept did 
        not adequately describe the "scoping" of address pools as is common 
        with many current server implementations.  Also updated the author's 
        address and contact information, and incorporated a number of 
        corrections and amplifications suggested by various readers of the "-
        04" draft, including a missing OID for dhcpv4ServerNotifyObjects and 
        a syntax error for DhcpPhysicalAddress. 

        The "-06" version corrects a number of flaws reported by Rick Geesen 
        and Jin Tao, mostly caused by typographical errors in the "-05" 
        version as well as some unintentionally omitted text for 
        dhcpv4ServerNotifyObjects.  The "-06" version also changes BOOTP and 
        DHCP statistics from mandatory to optional, renaming object 
        identifiers as required to match.  All objects, tables, and groups in 
        previous drafts for Dynamic DNS updating and Failover have been 
        removed.  All tables were carefully examined to be certain that they 
        really could be simply implemented.  Many items were renamed or 
        renumbered.  Placeholder definitions of message types (both requests 
        and responses) were added to support DHCPFORCERENEW, DHCPQUERY, 
        DHCPKNOWN, and DHCPUNKNOWN.  A few [more] typographical errors were 
        found and fixed.  Finally, some of the boilerplate text was brought 
        in line with standard requirements for Internet-Drafts. 

        The "-07" version includes a number of small fixes, but is mostly to 
        correct a version numbering error. 

        The "-08" version fixes a few typographical errors (wrong 
        capitalization of object identifiers and table entry values, spacing 
        of comments, and misspelled words) in preparation for Working Group 
        Last Call.  Many thanks to Rich Woundy for his detailed and extremely 
        helpful suggestions on the prior draft.  The standard boilerplate 
        ("The SNMP Management Framework") for all new MIBs was added as 
        section 2 and the standard references not previously included in 
        section 9 were added.  DisplayString objects were recast as 
        SnmpAdminString types to be consistent with current practice.  The 
        DhcpLabel textual convention was dropped entirely.  InetAddressIPv4, 
        and InetAddressPrefixLength replaced the IpAddress type as

     Internet Draft             DHCP Server MIB                March 2003 
      
        appropriate for Internetaddresses and subnet masks throughout the 
        MIB.  Numbering of OIDs was made consistent, and dhcpv4Counters was 
        subdivided into dhcpv4RecvdPacketCounters, dhcpv4SentPacketCounters, 
        and dhcpv4ErrorPacketCounters to eliminate the need for placeholders 
        for anticipated new DHCP message type codes, eliminating gaps in the 
        OID numbering scheme.  Two notification types, 
        dhcpv4ServerNotifyServerStart and dhcpv4ServerNotifyServerStop, were 
        added.  Compliance and object groups were extensively reworked to 
        match other changes to the MIB.  The proposed MIB itself was verified 
        by using smilint as required before submittal.  Object names were 
        revised to uniformly begin with "dhcpv4" or "bootp" to provide a 
        clear visual indication of their purpose.  A few objects were renamed 
        slightly to reflect their use, for example, serverServerStart and 
        serverServerStop were renamed dhcpv4ServerStartTime and 
        dhcpv4ServerStopTime.  All object groups were reorganized to better 
        reflect the structure of the MIB.  A few very long names were 
        shortened for improved readability. 


     7. Acknowledgements 

        This document is the result of work undertaken the by DHCP working 
        group.  The editors would like to particularly acknowledge the 
        development team from Carnegie-Mellon University whose work creating 
        a private MIB for their DHCP server inspired the development of this 
        proposal.  In particular, many thanks to Ryan Troll who provided a 
        great deal of useful feedback during the initial development of this 
        MIB. 

        Thanks to Nathan Lane, Kim Kinnear, Yannick Koehler, Rick Geesen, Jin 
        Tao, James Brister, Alan Hackert, Patrick Cosmo, Taeko Saito, and 
        Devrapratap Baul for their review, comments, and contributions.  
        Special thanks to Rich Woundy for his excellent suggestions that 
        contributed to the --08 draft:  any lingering errors are to be blamed 
        solely on the editors. 


     8. IANA Considerations 

        Several specific values for MIB objects require completion before 
        this memo can advance to RFC status.  These are: 

       o  OID value for "dhcp"  see MODULE-IDENTITY 

       o  Value of DHCPLEASEQUERY for "dhcpv4CountLeaseQueries" and 
          "dhcpv4ServerClientLastRequestType" objects 

       o  Value of DHCPLEASEKNOWN for "dhcpv4CountKnowns" and 
          "dhcpv4ServerClientLastResponseType" objects

     Internet Draft             DHCP Server MIB                March 2003 
      
       o  Value of DHCPLEASEUNKNOWN for "dhcpv4CountUnknowns" and 
          "dhcpv4ServerClientLastResponseType" objects 

       o  Value of DHCPLEASEACTIVE for "dhcpv4CountActives" and 
          "dhcpv4ServerClientLastResponseType" objects 

       o  Value of DHCPUNIMPLEMENTED for "dhcpv4CountUnimplementeds" and 
          "dhcpv4ServerClientLastResponseType" objects 


     9. Security Considerations 

        There are no management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX-
        ACCESS clause of read-write or read-create.  Such objects may be 
        considered sensitive or vulnerable in some environments.  The support 
        for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper 
        protection can have a negative effect on network operations.  
        Therefore, if this MIB is implemented correctly, there is no risk 
        that an intruder can alter or create any management objects of this 
        MIB via direct SNMP SET operations. 

        Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a 
        MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or 
        vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to 
        control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly 
        to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over 
        the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their 
        sensitivity/vulnerability: 

        o dhcpv4ServerRangeTable 

        o dhcpv4ServerAddressTable 

        These two objects, in conjunction, provide an observer with a current 
        view of the available and assigned addresses allocated by this 
        server.  Such knowledge can be used to manually configure a host 
        computer with a valid IP address for the network managed by the DHCP 
        server.  This could be part of either a Theft of Service scheme or a 
        Denial of Service attack wherein rogue (pseudo-)hosts simply claim 
        and defend IP addresses either to subvert accounting for their use or 
        to disrupt the network for legitimate hosts. 

        It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and 
        possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending 
        them over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide 
        features for such a secure environment. 

        SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.  
        Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), 
        even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is

     Internet Draft             DHCP Server MIB                March 2003 
      
        allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects 
        in this MIB. 

        It is recommended that the implementers consider the security 
        features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 
        8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms 
        (for authentication and privacy). 

        Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
        RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
        enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
        responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
        instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to 
        the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate 
        rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them. 

        Denial of Service attacks on a DHCP server are conceivable by 
        flooding the SNMP (sub-)agent with requests, tying up host system and 
        server resources processing SNMP messages.  The authors know of no 
        way to wholly prevent such attacks, but have attempted to construct 
        relatively simple tables to minimize the work required to respond to 
        messages.
