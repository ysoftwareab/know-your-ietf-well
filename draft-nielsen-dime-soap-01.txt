Abstract 


     This document defines an abstract model for SOAP attachments and 
     based on this model defines a mechanism for encapsulating a SOAP 
     message and zero or more attachments in a DIME message. SOAP 
     attachments are described using the notion of a compound document 
     structure consisting of a primary SOAP message and zero or more 
     related documents known as attachments.

1  Introduction 


     SOAP provides a flexible and extensible envelope for describing 
     structured information intended for exchange between SOAP nodes. 
     While SOAP 1.1 is described in terms of XML [12], SOAP 1.2 [17] 
     [18] is described in terms of XML Infoset [14]. In both cases, 
     however, XML is expected to be a widely used representation. 


     Assuming an XML-based representation, there are certain inherent 
     limitations in dealing with three particular issues: 


     1.   Encapsulation of binary data in the form of image files etc. 
          cannot be done without additional encoding/decoding of the 
          data. The overhead of encoding binary data in a form 
          acceptable to XML (for example using base64 [2]) is often 
          significant both in terms of bytes added because of the 
          encoding as well as processor overhead performing the 
          encoding/decoding. 


     2.   Encapsulation of other XML documents as well as XML fragments 
          is cumbersome within a SOAP message--especially if the XML 
          parts do not use the same character encoding. 

 
Nielsen, et al.                                               [Page 2] 
INTERNET-DRAFT                     WS-Attachments           June, 2002 
 
     3.   Although SOAP messages inherently are self-delimiting, the 
          message delimiter can only be detected by parsing the complete 
          message. This can imply a significant overhead in generic 
          message processing as well as parsing and memory allocation. 


     The W3C Note "SOAP with Attachments" [16] addresses point 1 and 2 
     above. However, MIME multipart itself adds extra parsing overhead 
     in order to determine the various parts of the MIME message. In 
     addition, while MIME is a successful general message description 
     format, the problem of encapsulating and delimiting messages is a 
     much more focused problem that does not require the full 
     expressiveness of MIME. 


     DIME [10] is a simple, lightweight message format that has been 
     explicitly limited to provide a few core services needed for 
     encapsulating messages. The purpose of this document is to describe 
     how to use existing facilities provided by SOAP, DIME, and URIs to 
     encapsulate SOAP messages and related documents (often known as 
     attachments). 


1.1  Notational Conventions 


     The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
     "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
     this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [5]. 


2  Compound SOAP Structures 


     The encapsulation of SOAP messages in DIME is based on an abstract 
     concept of a multi-component entity called a "compound SOAP 
     structure". This section defines the properties of a compound SOAP 
     structure and the requirements to a concrete representation of such 
     a structure. Section 3 defines a concrete representation based on 
     DIME, and section 4 defines the interactions between the DIME 
     representation and underlying protocols. 


2.1  Terminology 


     Compound SOAP structure 


          A compound SOAP structure consists of a primary SOAP message 
          part and zero or more related secondary parts. 



 
Nielsen, et al.                                               [Page 3]

     Primary SOAP message part 


          A SOAP message that provides the processing context for the 
          compound SOAP structure as a whole including the secondary 
          parts. 


     Secondary Part 


          A document or entity related to the primary SOAP message part 
          in some manner. A secondary part is a resource in the sense 
          that it has identity and is identified by a URI. The 
          representation of the resource can be of any type and size. 


2.2  Compound SOAP Structure Model 


     A compound SOAP structure consists of a primary SOAP message part 
     and zero or more related secondary parts that are distinct from the 
     primary SOAP message but related to it in some manner. 


     Secondary parts can be used to contain data that naturally 
     represents a resource in its own right or which is cumbersome to 
     represent within the primary SOAP message part. The latter can be 
     due to the size, type, or format of the data--a secondary part may 
     be an audio clip, an image, or a very large view of a database, for 
     example. 


     Secondary parts are often informally referred to as "attachments". 
     While the attachment relationship is expected to be commonly used, 
     the model makes no assumption about the nature of the relationship 
     between the primary SOAP message part and secondary parts, or 
     between secondary parts. 


     It is important to note that the compound SOAP structure model does 
     not modify or supersede the message concept defined by SOAP. Nor 
     does it define a processing model for any of the parts of a 
     compound SOAP structure including the primary SOAP message part. 
     The processing model for the primary SOAP message part is defined 
     by SOAP. The application-defined semantics of the SOAP message 
     provides the processing context for the secondary part(s). 


     Each part is identified by a URI that can be used to reference it 
     from other parts. The URI identifying a part can be of any URI 
     scheme. It is RECOMMENDED that only IANA registered URI schemes [9] 
     be used. 

 
Nielsen, et al.                                               [Page 4]

     The compound SOAP structure model does not require that a SOAP 
     receiver process, dereference, or otherwise verify any secondary 
     parts of a compound SOAP structure. It is up to the SOAP receiver 
     to determine, based on the processing context provided by the 
     primary SOAP message part, which operations must be performed (if 
     any) on the secondary part(s). 


2.3  Representing Compound SOAP Structures 


     The compound SOAP structure model is abstract in the sense that it 
     does not define an actual representation of a compound SOAP 
     structure. This section describes the requirements to a 
     specification defining a representation of a compound SOAP 
     structure. 


     Section 3 and 4 define a representation of a compound SOAP 
     structure using DIME as the encapsulation mechanism. This does not 
     preclude the definition of other representations; the definition of 
     such additional representations is outside the scope of this 
     specification. 


     A representation of a compound SOAP structure MUST describe the 
     following three parts: 


     o    An encapsulation mechanism for the primary SOAP message part 
          and for each secondary part. The encapsulation mechanism MAY 
          but NEED NOT be the same for all parts. 


     o    A mechanism by which all parts can be identified using a URI 
          reference. While the reference MUST be in the form of a URI, 
          the mechanism by which the URI is represented MAY but NEED NOT 
          be the same for all parts. 


     o    The interactions between the unit of encapsulation and the 
          underlying protocols supporting that unit of encapsulation. 
          The compound SOAP structure model is independent of the 
          underlying protocol used for exchanging the primary SOAP 
          message part and any of the secondary parts. That is, there is 
          no requirement that all parts of a compound SOAP structure 
          representation be exchanged within the same unit of the 
          underlying protocol. Note that in some cases, the 
          encapsulation mechanism may also provide the functionality of 
          the underlying protocol but this is not a requirement. 


     A representation of a compound SOAP structure SHOULD NOT presume 
     any particular message exchange pattern, message correlation or any 
 
Nielsen, et al.                                               [Page 5] 
INTERNET-DRAFT                     WS-Attachments           June, 2002 
 
     other feature that may be required in order to exchange SOAP 
     messages. 


     As examples of possible representations, a compound SOAP structure 
     consisting of a primary SOAP message part containing an insurance 
     claim for a damaged car and a secondary part containing a JPEG 
     image of the car, can be represented in several ways including but 
     not limited to the following: 


     1.   The primary SOAP message part and the JPEG image may be 
          encapsulated in a single DIME message and exchanged using an 
          underlying protocol like TCP or HTTP [8] (see section 3 and 
          4). 


     2.   The primary SOAP message part may be exchanged using the HTTP 
          protocol binding without any further encapsulation and the 
          JPEG image exchanged using a separate HTTP GET request. This 
          representation is not formally defined by this specification 
          but only provided as an example. 


     A representation MUST unambiguously indicate either explicitly or 
     implicitly which part is the primary SOAP message part. A SOAP 
     receiver implementing a particular representation of a compound 
     SOAP structure MUST process the primary SOAP message part according 
     to the rules for processing SOAP messages [15] [17]. 


     Representations of compound SOAP structures MAY be nested by having 
     a secondary part of one representation contain a representation of 
     another compound SOAP structure. In this case, the primary SOAP 
     message part is the primary SOAP message part of the outermost 
     representation and as for any other secondary part, the semantics 
     of the primary SOAP message part provides the processing context 
     for the nested representation(s). 


     While representations MAY provide mechanisms for verifying the 
     integrity and enumerating the parts of a compound SOAP structure, 
     this is not a requirement of the compound SOAP structure model. 


     In the remaining part of this specification, we define a 
     representation of a compound SOAP structure using DIME as the 
     encapsulation mechanism.

3  Representing a Compound SOAP Structure in DIME 


     This specification defines the mechanisms needed in order to 
     represent a compound SOAP structure using DIME. The representation 
     contains three parts: 


     1.   The encapsulation of the primary SOAP message part and of 
          secondary parts associated with that primary SOAP part as 
          individual payloads in a DIME message (see section 3.1). 


     2.   Rules for handling URI references between the primary SOAP 
          message part and its secondary parts (see section 3.2). 


     3.   A description of how the DIME encapsulation affects existing 
          SOAP underlying protocol bindings (see section 4). 


     While a DIME message provides an encapsulation mechanism for a SOAP 
     message, it does not provide protocol support for exchanging SOAP 
     messages between SOAP nodes. As such, the mechanisms defined for 
     encapsulating SOAP in DIME constitutes a "binding property" and not 
     a SOAP protocol binding according to the SOAP 1.2 Protocol Binding 
     Framework (see [18]). The name by which one can refer to the 
     binding property defined by this specification is the following 
     URI: 


          http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2002/06/dime/soap 


     DIME MAY be used in, but does not require, a MIME or MIME-like 
     environment. The DIME representation defined in this section can be 
     used in combination with underlying protocols regardless of whether 
     they provide a MIME environment or not. 


     The DIME representation of a compound SOAP structure does not 
     presume a particular message exchange pattern, or the presence of 
     other features that may be required in order to exchange SOAP 
     messages. 


3.1  Encapsulating a Compound SOAP Structure 


     The primary SOAP message part MUST be the first payload of the DIME 
     message. The format of the payload MUST be an XML serialization of 
     the primary SOAP message part. By convention, the first payload in 
     a DIME message provides the processing context for the whole DIME 
     message (see [10]). 
 
Nielsen, et al.                                               [Page 7] 
INTERNET-DRAFT                     WS-Attachments           June, 2002 
 
     The properties of the first DIME record are as follows: 


     o    The DIME payload type indicates that this is a SOAP envelope. 
          Depending on the SOAP version, this is done in one of two 
          ways: for SOAP 1.2, the value of the DIME TYPE field MUST be 
          the MIME media type "application/soap+xml" [11]; for SOAP 1.1, 
          as no dedicated media type is defined, the value MUST be the 
          absolute URI "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/". 


     o    The DIME payload identifier MAY be used to identify the 
          primary SOAP message so that it is possible to refer to it 
          from secondary parts. The identifier is a URI as described in 
          section 3.2.  


     While this representation identifies the primary SOAP message part 
     by requiring it to be the first payload in a DIME message, it does 
     not provide a means for identifying a primary SOAP message part 
     within the SOAP message itself, for example as part of a manifest 
     carried within the SOAP envelope. A separate specification might 
     describe such a mechanism. 


     Any subsequent payloads in a DIME message MUST be secondary parts 
     related to the primary SOAP message part. Each secondary part is 
     encapsulated as a separate payload carried in DIME records with the 
     following properties: 


     o    The DIME payload type is the type of the secondary part. For 
          example, if the secondary part is a JPEG image, the DIME 
          payload type is "image/jpeg". 


     o    The DIME payload identifier SHOULD be used to identify the 
          secondary part so that it is possible to refer to it from the 
          primary SOAP message part and other secondary parts. The 
          identifier is a URI as described in section 3.2.  


     In all cases, the DIME record length is, as defined by DIME, the 
     length of the data carried in the DIME record. Note that a part MAY 
     be chunked. 


     Example 1 illustrates the sample compound SOAP message structure 
     described in section 2.3 represented using DIME. The first payload 
     is the primary SOAP 1.2 message part, and the remaining payloads 
     are accompanying attachments. In this example, there is one 
     attachment. If there are no attachments then the SOAP message is 
     the only payload in the DIME message.

          DIME Record 1: Primary SOAP message part 
          TNF:           1 
          Type:          application/soap+xml 
          Id:               


          DIME Record 2: Secondary part 
          TNF:           1 
          Type:          image/jpeg 
          Id:            uuid:09233523-345b-4351-b623-5dsf35sgs5d6 


        Example 1: DIME representation of sample compound SOAP 
        structure containing a primary SOAP message part and an 
        image as a secondary part. 


     There is no requirement that all secondary parts of a compound SOAP 
     structure be encoded within the same DIME message. Depending on the 
     semantics of the primary SOAP message part, it may be appropriate 
     to include only a subset of the secondary parts in the same DIME 
     message as the primary SOAP message part. 


     The DIME representation does not provide any mechanism for 
     verifying the integrity or enumerating the parts of a compound SOAP 
     structure. While many applications may require such mechanisms, it 
     is an explicitly choice not to include them in this specification. 


3.2  Usage of URI References 


     The primary SOAP message part may need to refer to any secondary 
     part and secondary parts themselves may need to refer to each 
     other. This section defines the rules for using URI references in 
     order to reference other parts in a DIME encoded compound SOAP 
     construct.  


     While the DIME representation defines a mechanism for indicating 
     the URI of a secondary part, it does not in general prescribe a 
     mechanism for indicating a URI reference to a secondary part or to 
     the primary SOAP message part. However, if a reference to a part is 
     provided within the context of the SOAP 1.1 data encoding [16], the 
     URI reference MUST be indicated using the "href" attribute as 
     defined by the SOAP 1.1 data encoding. 


     The mechanism defined in this section is independent of any 
     particular mechanism used for indicating URI references. The usage 
     of URI references involves the following two steps: 


 
Nielsen, et al.                                               [Page 9] 
INTERNET-DRAFT                     WS-Attachments           June, 2002 
 
     1.   Convert all relative URI references to absolute URI references 
          (see section 3.2.1). 


     2.   Match the absolute URI references used in compound SOAP 
          structure parts with the DIME record identifier of each part 
          in order to detect cross-references (see section 3.2.2). 


     While the steps above apply to all URI references regardless of URI 
     scheme, it is RECOMMENDED that when possible, globally unique 
     identifiers such as "uuid:" URIs be used to identify compound SOAP 
     structure parts encoded in a DIME message. 


     DIME imposes certain length limitations on URIs used as DIME record 
     identifiers. Please refer to the DIME specification for details on 
     these limitations. 


3.2.1 Determining a Base URI 


     For each relative URI reference encoded in a DIME record or used as 
     a DIME record payload identifier, a base URI can be determined 
     using the framework provided by RFC 2396 [6]. Given a base URI, a 
     relative URI reference can be made absolute following the rules 
     defined by RFC 2396, section 5.2. Note, that these rules only apply 
     to base URIs that are hierarchical in nature and hence enable 
     relative URIs in the first place. 


     The mechanism for determining a base URI for relative URI 
     references used in compound SOAP structure parts is identical 
     regardless of whether the reference is found in the primary SOAP 
     message part or in a secondary part. The mechanism also applies to 
     relative URI references used as DIME record identifiers. 


     The mechanism, which consists of four rules applied in order of 
     precedence, is as follows: 


     1.   Base URI embedded in the parts' content: For example, the base 
          URI for a relative URI reference may be defined using XML Base 
          [13]. 


     2.   Base URI of the encapsulating entity: If there is a DIME 
          record identifier with an absolute URI as value then that URI 
          is the base URI of the part. In the case of nested DIME 
          messages, this step may be repeated in the order from 
          innermost to outermost in order to determine the most specific 
          base URI. 
 
Nielsen, et al.                                              [Page 10] 
INTERNET-DRAFT                     WS-Attachments           June, 2002 
 
     3.   The URI used to retrieve the entity: If the underlying 
          protocol provides a URI used for retrieving the entity then 
          that URI is the base URI. 


     4.   Default Base URI: If the URI reference is not a same-document 
          reference as defined by RFC 2396, section 4.2, the default 
          base URI is "thismessage:/" as defined by RFC 2557 [7]. The 
          use of this special URI scheme enables relative URI references 
          used in different parts encoded within the same DIME message 
          to share a common (fictitious) base URI. 


     Note that while these rules are applicable to same-document URI 
     references such as an empty URI reference or a URI reference 
     containing only a fragment identifier, such references may not need 
     to be made absolute in order to be dereferenced (see RFC 2396, 
     section 4.2 and XInclude [19]). 


3.2.2 Matching URI References 


     Once absolute URI references are determined as described in section 
     3.2.1, it is possible to match the URI references found in the 
     compound SOAP structure parts encoded in a DIME message with the 
     URI references used to identify the parts. 


     As mentioned in section 2.3 it is not a requirement that URI 
     references be dereferenced or otherwise verified by the SOAP 
     receiver. Such operations are determined by the processing 
     semantics of the context in which the reference is found. 


     Example 2 provides a sample primary SOAP message part illustrating 
     a reference to a secondary part using a "uuid:" URI.

       </s:Body> 
     </s:Envelope> 


        Example 2: Given the DIME encoded compound SOAP structure 
        illustrated in Example 1, the primary SOAP message part 
        can refer to the secondary part using the URI 
        "uuid:09233523-345b-4351-b623-5dsf35sgs5d6". 


     This specification does not provide any equivalence rules for URIs 
     as these are defined by the individual URI schemes and by RFC 2396 
     [6]. Because of inconsistencies with respect to some URI 
     equivalence rules in many current URI parsers, it is STRONGLY 
     RECOMMENDED that URI matching only rely on the most rudimentary 
     equivalence rules defined by RFC 2396. 


4  DIME and SOAP Underlying Protocol Bindings 


     Depending on the underlying protocol binding, using DIME for 
     encoding compound SOAP structures may affect the parameters of the 
     underlying protocol binding. This specification describes the 
     interactions between the DIME representation and the HTTP binding 
     for SOAP 1.2 and SOAP 1.1 respectively. The DIME representation MAY 
     be used in combination with other protocol bindings. In this case, 
     the specification for such bindings SHOULD describe any 
     interactions with the DIME representation.  


4.1  SOAP 1.2 HTTP Binding Interactions 


     A DIME encoded compound SOAP structure is in all regards identical 
     to the SOAP 1.2 HTTP protocol binding but for the following two 
     exceptions: 


     1.   The HTTP Content-Type header field MUST have a value of 
          "application/dime" rather than "application/soap+xml" as 
          defined by SOAP 1.2 [11]. 

 
Nielsen, et al.                                              [Page 12] 
INTERNET-DRAFT                     WS-Attachments           June, 2002 
 
     2.   The DIME message constitutes the HTTP entity body and must 
          appear as described in section 3.1. 


4.2  SOAP 1.1 HTTP Binding Interactions 


     The rules for forming an HTTP message containing a DIME encoded 
     compound SOAP structure follows the SOAP 1.1 HTTP protocol binding 
     in all regards but for the following two exceptions: 


     1.   The HTTP Content-Type header field MUST have a value of 
          "application/dime" rather than "text/xml" as defined by SOAP 
          1.1. 


     2.   The DIME message constitutes the HTTP entity body and must 
          appear as described in section 3.1. 


     The SOAPAction HTTP header field is unaffected by the DIME 
     encapsulation. 


5  Internationalization Considerations 


     This specification does not introduce internationalization 
     considerations beyond what is introduced by SOAP, DIME, and URIs. 
     This specification refers to the considerations described by those 
     specifications.  


6  Security Considerations  


     Implementers should pay special attention to the security 
     implications of any payload types that can cause the remote 
     execution of any actions in the recipient's environment. Before 
     accepting payloads of any type, an application should be aware of 
     the particular security implications associated with that type. 
     This applies not only to compound SOAP structure parts encapsulated 
     in DIME but to any part regardless of the encapsulation. 


     Security considerations for media types in general are discussed in 
     RFC 2048 [4] and in the context of the "application/postscript" and 
     the "message/external-body" media type in RFC 2046 [3]. 


     To address concerns about integrity and confidentiality, 
     attachments can be digitally signed and encrypted. A compound SOAP 
     structure that includes signed or encrypted attachments would 
 
Nielsen, et al.                                              [Page 13] 
INTERNET-DRAFT                     WS-Attachments           June, 2002 
 
     include security information about the attachments in the security 
     header of the primary SOAP message part. The WS-Security 
     specification [20] provides a means to protect a message by 
     encrypting and/or digitally signing a body, a header, an 
     attachment, or any combination of them (or parts of them). 


          Note: This specification does not presently define any 
          mechanisms for binding a SOAP payload to a DIME header to 
          prevent certain classes of security attacks. Future versions 
          of this specification will address this open issue. 


7  IANA Considerations 


     This specification does not describe any components that require 
     registration by IANA. 


8  Intellectual Property
