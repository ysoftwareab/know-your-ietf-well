1.  Introduction

   YANG [RFC6020] [RFC6087] is a data definition language that was
   introduced to model the configuration and running state of a device
   managed using NETCONF [RFC6241].  YANG is now also being used as a
   component of wider management interfaces, such as CLIs.

   This document defines a draft YANG data model that can be used to
   configure and manage Protocol-Independent Multicast (PIM) devices.
   Currently this model is incomplete, but it will support the core PIM
   protocol, as well as many other features mentioned in separate PIM
   RFCs.  Non-core features are defined as optional in the provided data
   model.

Internet-Draft                  PIM YANG                       July 2015


1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
   [RFC6020].

   This draft employs YANG tree diagrams, which are explained in
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc6087bis].

2.  Design of Data Model

2.1.  Scope of model

   The model covers PIM Sparse Mode [RFC4601], including the Source-
   Specfic subset [RFC3569], Dense Mode [RFC3973], and Bi-directional
   PIM [RFC5015].

   The PIM extensions represented in the model include BSR [RFC5059] and
   Anycast RP [RFC4610].

   The representation of some of these features is not completely
   specified in this draft of the data model.  This model is being
   circulated in its current form for early oversight and review of the
   basic hierarchy.

   This model does not cover other multicast protocols such as IGMP/MLD,
   MSDP, mVPN, or m-LDP in-band signalling.  It does not cover any
   configuration required to generate the MRIB.  These will be covered
   by future Internet Drafts.

2.2.  Optional capabilities

   This model is designed to represent the capabilities of PIM devices
   with various specifications, including some with basic subsets of the
   PIM protocol.  Since a design goal of this draft is to define a data
   model that is capable of representing all of these implementations,
   these modules declare a number of features representing capabilities
   that not all deployed devices support.

   The extensive use of feature declarations should substantially
   simplify the capability negotiation process for a vendor's PIM
   implementation.

Internet-Draft                  PIM YANG                       July 2015


   For the same reason, wide constant ranges (for example, timer maxima
   and minima) will be used in the model.  It is expected that vendors
   will augment the model with any specific restrictions that might be
   required.  Vendors may also extend the features list with proprietary
   extensions.

2.3.  Top-level structure

   This model defines several separate modules for modelling PIM
   configuration, defined below.  Again, this separation will make it
   easier to express the specific capabilities of a PIM device.

   The hierarchy of PIM configuration is designed so that objects that
   are only relevant for one situation or feature are collected in a
   container for that feature.  For example, the configuration for PIM-
   SM that is not relevant for an SSM-only implementation is collected
   in an ASM container.

   Where fields are not genuinely essential to protocol operation, they
   are marked as optional.  Some fields will be essential but have a
   default specified, so they need not be explicitly configured.

3.  Unresolved Issues

3.1.  Current status of work in progress

   The model so far details how the PIM modules interact and covers the
   higher levels of their hierarchy.  Some details of interface
   configuration, RP configuration, and PIM-ASM-specific parameters are
   also complete.

   For a list of the most substantial areas still to cover, please see
   the "TODO list" section below.

3.2.  Position of address family in hierarchy

   The current draft (1) has an address-family container at a high level
   in the hierarchy of the model, with an interface list as a child
   object.  This is a similar structure to the draft OSPF YANG model.
   There is ongoing discussion about this decision in the design team,
   so this may be considered unresolved.

   An alternative structure (2) would be for the address family to be a
   sub- list of the interface object.  We would then provide interface
   configuration objects at both an address family-specific and a non-
   AF-specific level, exposing both options as mutually-exclusive
   features.  This would be a similar structure to the IS-IS YANG draft.




Liu, et al.              Expires January 4, 2016                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                  PIM YANG                       July 2015


   Another option (3) would be to expose both sets of objects, address-
   family specific and all-address-family, both exposed as features.
   Vendors could then advertise support for one or other of the
   features.  This is the approach taken in this draft for entity-scoped
   parameters like graceful restart configuration.

   The advantages of (1) over (2) are that interface objects effectively
   represent {interface, address-family} pairs, which is in line with
   several existing implementations.  Expressing interface-scoped
   configuration that is also address family dependent is made much
   easier using this model.

   It also may be useful to be able to configure router-wide options on
   an address-family basis, which would be more inconvenient if address
   family were a child object of the interface list.  At least one
   deployed implementation allows configuration of basic router-scoped
   concepts on an address family basis.

   The main disadvantage of (1) compared to (2) is for implementations
   that configure interfaces on an address-family-independent basis with
   one set of configuration.  This is true of some existing vendors'
   implementations, as PIM has a single specification for IPv4 and IPv6
   address families, and for these implementations the structure (2) is
   more natural.  For some interface parameters there is no clear use-
   case for address-family-specific configuration.

   For these implementations, the restriction that interface
   configuration must be address-family independent must be expressed
   somehow.  This can be done in various ways; perhaps the easiest is a
   constraint of a form similar to:

   must ". = ../../address-family[address-family='ipv4']/
   interface[interface=current()/sibling:interface]/dr-priority" {
   error-app-tag dr-priority-mismatch; error-message "Error: IPv6 DR
   priority must match IPv4 DR priority "; }

   Conversely, if (2) were adopted, an implementation that allowed
   address- family-specific configuration would have to make
   augmentations to the base model in order to express that flexibility.
   Those augmentations would not be particularly difficult to make,
   however.

   The advantage of (3) over (1) or (2) is that no such vendor
   augmentations or constraints would be required.  It is likely that
   vendors' requirements under models (1) or (2) would be similar enough
   that option (3) would cover all needs in this area.

   The advantage of (1) or (2) over (3) is just that the model is
   simpler and leaner, and that feature negotiation is simpler and
   easier to understand.

3.3.  RP configuration tree

   This draft of the model provides a module (currently called pim-rp)
   which is used for group range mapping configuration.  Though some of
   this configuration is only relevant for some PIM modes, the pim-rp
   structure itself is independent of the PIM mode structures.

   The main advantage of this structure is that it substantially
   simplifies the representation of the mapping algorithm from a
   specific group address to its PIM mode and configuration.  Validation
   is also easier, as only the pim-rp module itself needs to be checked
   if there is another entry with a conflicting or inconsistent group
   prefix.

   There are also some advantages to this approach in non-duplication of
   configuration parameters that are specific to multiple PIM modes,
   such as BSR.

   The current name of this module is pim-rp, as it is roughly analogous
   to the pimStaticRPTable in the PIM MIB, and it is currently indexed
   by RP.

   However, as it is used for some group-range-scoped configuration not
   directly related to RPs, and because a single RP address might need
   two rows in the table (for SM and BI-DIR), it might be better to call
   this something like pim-group-mapping and index it on group range.
   This is still under discussion.

3.4.  Passive mode

   This draft contains an interface leaf 'passive', indicating that no
   PIM protocol messages are to be sent on the interface.

   For some implementations, there is a closely related concept,
   configurable on a PIM-mode basis, that an interface is not used to
   run the PIM protocol and also not used for multicast forwarding.
   This may be used to restrict dense-mode flooding, for example.  This
   will likely be included as a feature in a future draft, but the
   details are under discussion.

4.  Module Structure

4.1.  PIM base module

   The PIM base module defines the router-wide configuration options not
   specific to any PIM mode, and is included by the other modules.
   There are a couple of things worth mentioning here regarding where
   the PIM model fits in the overall routing hierarchy:

   1.  Our current direction is to agree to a routing-instance-centric
       (VRF) model as opposed to protocol-centric mainly because it fits
       well into the routing-instance model, and it is easier to map
       from the VRF-centric to the protocol-centric than the other way
       around due to forward references.

   2.  The PIM base model will augment "/rt:routing/rt:routing-instance/
       rt:routing-protocols:" as opposed to augmenting "/rt:routing/
       rt:routing-instance/rt:routing-protocols:/rt:routing-protocol" as
       the latter would allow multiple protocol instances per VRF, which
       does not make sense for PIM.

4.2.  PIM RP module

   The PIM RP module contains configuration information scoped to ranges
   of group addresses.  This does not belong in the hierarchy under any
   PIM mode, as it is how group ranges are assigned to PIM modes.

   Some of the content of the module, however, is only relevant to some
   modes (for example, BSR is only relevant to ASM and BIDIR).  This is
   clarified in the module itself using "if-feature" and "when"
   statements.

6.  TODO list

   In this draft, several aspects of the model are incomplete.  The PIM-
   DM and BI-DIR modules are just placeholders for now to demonstrate
   the hierarchy of the model.  Other things the draft will include when
   complete but does not yet include:

   o  State reporting

   o  Notifications

   o  Neighbor configuration

   o  Interaction with BFD protocol

   o  Constraints (constant ranges, validation)

   o  State-limiting and policy

   o  Statistics.

   For these subjects, we will employ the same design principles of
   expressing a highly general model; vendors may use features and add
   augmentations in order to express which subsets of this general model
   are valid in their implementations.

7.  Security Considerations

   The data model defined does not introduce any security implications.

   This draft does not change any underlying security issues inherent in
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-routing-cfg].

8.  IANA Considerations

   TBD

9.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to thank Steve Baillargeon, Guo Feng, Hu
   Fangwei, Robert Kebler, Tanmoy Kundu, Liu Yisong, Mahesh Sivakumar,
   and Stig Venaas for their valuable contributions.
