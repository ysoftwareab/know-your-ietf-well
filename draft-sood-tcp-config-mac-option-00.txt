Abstract 
    
   This RFC proposes a generic and configurable message authentication 
   code (MAC) option for TCP.  This work extends the practice defined in 
   TCP MD5 Signature Option for BGP sessions [RFC-2385].  This RFC 
   describes a new TCP option that allows any TCP-based application to 
   enhance security in TCP connections.  This option is configurable 
   because it allows implementers to choose the digest mechanism of 
   choice for each TCP connection.  This digest mechanism constructs a 
   MAC for each TCP segment, using a (preferably) connection specific 
   shared secret key and components from TCP header and data.

1. Introduction 
    
   TCP is a transport protocol [RFC-0793], widely deployed and used in 
   current networks.  MD5 is a digest algorithm used in message 
   authentication mechanisms [RFC-1321].  Additional digest algorithms 
   have since been developed, and are good candidates for complementing 
   MD5. 
    
   The primary motivation for adding this option is to provide a 
   stronger mechanism into the TCP protocol, which allows for both ends 
   of a TCP connection to verify the authenticity of the TCP segments 
   from itsÆ peer.  RFC 2385 discusses a current practice used for 
   securing BGP against spoofed TCP segments, especially the TCP resets.  
   Spoofing TCP segments requires an attacker to guess the sequence 
   number and the shared secret key for that connection.  This shared 
   secret key is used in computing the MD5 digest for each TCP segment. 
    
   The proposal in this document is an attempt to formalize this 
   mechanism, and enable it to be used by all TCP applications, if they 
   choose to.  Various weaknesses in MD5 [Dobb-96] have now been 
   identified.  RFC 2385 is not only limiting the application to MD5 
   algorithm, but also prescribing a digest mechanism that is less 
   cryptographically secure than, say SHA1 [FIPS-180-1] and HMAC [RFC-
   2104].

                     TCP Configurable MAC Option        February 2004 
 
 
   This document describes how to add an option to the TCP header, 
   called the Configurable Message Authentication Code (MAC) option, 
   which allows a configurable digest to be applied to all segments of 
   TCP connections. 
    
   This document maintains the same set of steps that are described in 
   RFC-2385 for the creation of the digest. 
 
2. TCP Configurable MAC Option Specification 
 
   Every TCP segment, which has to be protected against spoofing, will 
   contain a digest in this option.  This digest is created using the 
   digest mechanism defined in this document.  This option also defines 
   a field for the length (in number of Bytes) of the digest, which is 
   included in this option.  The digest can be truncated for insertion 
   into this TCP option. 
    
   Unlike other TCP options (like Window Scale Option) [RFC-1323], this 
   option is not negotiable between the peers.  The sender should be 
   independent of receiverÆs capability to verify and apply digest MACs, 
   when using this option.  In other words, this option should be used 
   by a sending application, as per itÆs requirement for having segments 
   authenticated by the receiving peer. 
    
2.1 Processing 
    
   Every TCP segment sent on the TCP connection, which has to be 
   protected against spoofing, will contain the Configurable MAC Option, 
   and the receiver must verify the MAC.  This option includes the 
   computation of the digest MAC value by the sender, using the senderÆs 
   shared secret key for that connection.  The steps required for 
   creation of this digest MAC are described in Section 2.2. 
    
   The receiver of every TCP segment must re-compute the MAC for every 
   segment received.  Receiver follows the same steps as the sender in 
   MAC creation, but uses its shared secret key for this connection.  
   The receiver then validates the received MAC digest contained in the 
   option, with the computed MAC digest.   
    
   TCP segments are accepted for additional processing after the MAC 
   values have been compared to be the same.  Any TCP connection 
   initiated with a SYN segment with MAC option applied to it, dictates 
   that all following segments in the connection (including SYN/ACK, 
   Data), must also have the MAC computed for each segment.  Receiver 
   discards TCP segments for which the MAC values do not match.  The 
   receiver also discards follow-up segments for this connection, which 
   do not have the MAC option. No further processing is done for 
   discarded segments.

2.2 MAC Creation  
    
   The sender first selects a digest algorithm to be used in this 
   option.  This can be configuration option for each TCP connection, or 
   based on a global policy established at the senderÆs end.  A shared 
   secret key, preferably connection specific, must also be established 
   through an out-of-band mechanism.  Definition of this mechanism is 
   outside the scope of this document. 
    
   The following items are applied to the selected digest algorithm, in 
   the order specified below.  Note that this is the same order 
   specified in RFC-2385, to minimize changes to current applications, 
   including BGP, that use RFC-2385 proposals. 
      1. TCP pseudo header in the order: 
           a. Source IP address 
           b. Destination IP address 
           c. Zero-padded protocol number 
           d. Segment Length 
      2. TCP header, excluding options, and assuming a checksum of 
         zero. 
      3. TCP segment data, if any 
      4. An independently specified shared secret key or password, 
         known to both TCP peers and presumably connection specific. 
    
   The TCP header and pseudo-header are in network byte order.  The 
   sending TCP host is in complete control of inserting this option, and 
   independent of the receiving host understanding this option.  A 
   mutual implementation of this option will be necessary for the 
   creation of authenticated TCP connections between the peers. 
    
2.3 Option Syntax 
    
   This option would appear in every segment of a connection, including 
   the SYN, ACK/SYN, and data segments.  The proposed option has the 
   following format: 
    
                +---------+---------+---------+---------+ 
                | Kind=21 |Length=20|Dig Type |Dig Len  | 
                +---------+---------+-------------------+ 
                |  MAC Digest...(full/truncated/padded) |           
                +---------------------------------------+ 
                |                                       | 
                +---------------------------------------+ 
                |                                       | 
                +-------------------+-------------------+ 
                |                   | 
                +-------------------+ 
    
   The fields are defined below:

      Kind       1 Octet: The TCP option; value = 21 decimal 
      Length     1 Octet: Length of the option, as defined in RFC-0793; 
                  value = 20 decimal 
      Dig Type    1 Octet: Digest algorithm to be used.  Possible values 
                  are defined in section 2.4. 
      Dig Length  1 Octet: Length of MAC digest (in Bytes) included in 
                  this option.  This must be less than or equal to 16. 
      Digest     16 Octets: Computed MAC digest, either complete, 
                  Padded or truncated, to fit the 16 octets defined in 
                  this option.  The digest field must be filled 
                  starting first bytes of the computed digest value.  
                  Any pad bytes should be 0x00. 
                  Example: MD5 digest will be inserted completely, as 
                  it is 16 Bytes in length; HMAC-SHA1-96 will have 12 
                  Bytes of digest and rest padded with 0x00; SHA1 
                  digest, which is inherently 20 Bytes, will be 
                  truncated to first 16 Bytes. 
    
2.4 Digest Values 
    
   This section explains the digest values that can be used for filling 
   the ôDig Typeö field in the option header. 
    
         Dig Type     Meaning 
         --------     ------- 
          0x01         SHA-1 
          0x02         MD-5 
          0x03         HMAC-SHA1 
          0x04         HMAC-MD5 
          0x05         HMAC-SHA1-96 [RFC-2404] 
          0x06         HMAC-MD5-96 [RFC-2403] 
          0x07         DES-MAC 
          0x08         AES-CCM [RFC-3610] 
 
   All other values are reserved.  
    
3. TCP Implications 
 
3.1 TCP Header Size 
    
   Inclusion of TCP options increases the header size, and, therefore, 
   the size of this option must also be considered and impacts 
   understood.  The Configurable MAC Option defined in this document 
   specifies a total length of 20 Bytes. 
    
   Calculation of the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) should now 
   consider the additional 20 Bytes of header on every TCP segment.  The 

 
 
Sood                    Expires - August 2004                [Page 5] 
                     TCP Configurable MAC Option        February 2004 
 
 
   MTU of the interface should now subtract an additional 20 Bytes for 
   effective MTU calculation. 
    
   Larger TCP headers lead to a lower effective throughput.  This 
   decrease in effective throughput is dependent on the packet sizes of 
   the application.  Applications must appropriately determine the 
   impacts of these larger header sizes on their traffic patterns. 
    
   The maximum size of this option has been limited to 20 Bytes to 
   accommodate all other options that have to be carried in a typical 
   SYN packet.  Based on TCP specifications [RFC-0793], the maximum size 
   of TCP header is 60 Bytes.  A breakup of the sizes used by various 
   options, above the standard 20 Bytes TCP header, is defined below: 
    
              . 4 Bytes of MSS option 
              . 4 Bytes window scale option 
              . 12 Bytes for time-stamp [RFC-1323] 
              . 20 Bytes for Configurable MAC Option 
    
   This sums to 40 Bytes.  Along with the standard 20 Byte TCP header, 
   the total reaches the maximum allowed TCP header size of 60 Bytes. 
    
   Please note that, as per RFC-0793, the end-of-option-list padding is 
   not necessary.  This is because the total length of all options has 
   reached the end of the maximum TCP header size. 
 
3.2 TCP Connectionless Resets 
    
   As discussed in RFC-2385, the receiver of the reset will ignore 
   connectionless resets, since the sender of the spoofed reset does not 
   know the shared secret key between communicating TCP peers.  The 
   intruding peer sending these connectionless resets will either 
   generate incorrect MAC digests using a bad key, or send the reset 
   without this TCP option.  In either case, the resets will be ignored. 
    
   Therefore, it becomes the responsibility of the TCP peer application 
   (say, BGP) to recover from crashes of its connection peer.  
   Additional cases where the application has to perform recovery 
   include: TCP resets not generated in response to stale connections, 
   and for connection attempts to a peer without a listener on that TCP 
   port. 
 
3.3 Additional TCP Header Options 
    
   Use of the TCP configurable MAC option will use 20-bytes from the 
   total of 40-bytes available for specifying TCP header options.   
    
   One of the options that may be impacted is the use of TCP Selective 
   Acknowledgement (SACK) Option [RFC-2018], when the TCP configurable 
 
 
Sood                    Expires - August 2004                [Page 6] 
                     TCP Configurable MAC Option        February 2004 
 
 
   MAC option is used.  The SACK option requires, at the minimum, 10-
   bytes to specify at least one non-contiguous block of TCP data 
   received at the receiver.  Each additional SACK block requires 8 
   bytes of TCP header space.  Since, SACK options are not used in SYN 
   segments, TCP header space will not be an issue for SYN segments.  
   For TCP data segments that use configurable MAC option, the SACK 
   option cannot be used when TCP Window Scale option and TCP time-stamp 
   options are in use.   
    
   If window-scale and time-stamp options are excluded in TCP headers, 
   then TCP configurable MAC option and SACK/D-SACK options can co-exist 
   in the same TCP header.  The number of SACK/D-SACK blocks will, 
   however, be limited to available TCP header size. 
    
   Applications and TCP implementation at the sender, which originates 
   the SYN, will determine the trade-offs between using the configurable 
   MAC option, and other TCP options.  Of special concern will be the 
   desirability of establishing an authenticated TCP connection, and the 
   advantages of having SACK/D-SACK [RFC-2883], Timestamp, and window-
   scale options.  The choices will depend on network characteristics. 
 
4. Performance 
    
   Local computation of the MAC digest and comparing it with the MAC 
   digest value in the TCP option header will be a pre-requisite to any 
   further TCP processing.  These two additional steps will show their 
   impact on the normal processing rate of TCP implementations.  MD5 
   digest generation is generally faster than the corresponding SHA1-1 
   digest generation.  The HMAC-based algorithms are slower, albeit more 
   secure, than their corresponding base algorithms. 
    
   A sample of performance numbers (Mbps) as seen on a 730 MHz Pentium-
   III processor with 256K Cache is as follows: 
    
      Algorithm\TCP Segment Size (Bytes)      16B    1024B 
      ---------------------------------------------------- 
              MD5                             88      600 Mbps 
              SHA-1                           75      342 Mbps   
              HMAC-MD5                        50      442 Mbps 
              AES-128                        119      118 Mbps 
    
   On this platform, a delay of 2.56 usecs (.00256 msec) is noticed for 
   generation of signature for an ACK, using HMAC-MD5.  Generation of a 
   signature for a TCP segment with 1024 Bytes of data took 18.53 usecs 
   (0.01853 msecs), using HMAC-MD5.  Similar delays will be experienced 
   both at the receiver and at the sender, depending on the processing 
   speed of their respective platforms.  The receiver will also bear the 
   additional cost of performing the 16-Byte compare operation.

   There is also a potential TCP performance and network traffic impact 
   in not using the TCP time-stamp, window-scale, and SACK/D-SACK 
   options, when the TCP configurable MAC option is in use.  SACK/D-SACK 
   and configurable MAC options can co-exist, but will limit the number 
   of SACK blocks that are sent in the TCP header. 
    
5. Security Considerations 
 
   This document defines a MAC digest based message authentication 
   security mechanism for TCP peers, computed using a pre-shared common 
   secret between the peers.  The proposal is designed to use only one 
   of the digest algorithms, and as such, is as secure as the underlying 
   cryptographic security of those algorithms. 
    
   In addition, the shared secret value must be of sufficient length to 
   support each digest algorithmÆs strength.  Neither the length nor the 
   selection criteria of this shared secret should downgrade the 
   inherent strength of the algorithm in any manner.  The mechanism 
   through which the shared secret is generated and communicated between 
   the TCP connection peers is beyond the scope of this document. 
    
   This proposal also prescribes truncation of the calculated MAC digest 
   value (like, SHA-1: 20 Bytes) to accommodate into the available 
   options field space (16-Bytes).  Various algorithms allow different 
   characteristics when truncated.  Therefore, determination of the 
   truncation impact on the algorithm strength must be made prior to 
   using that digest algorithm for authentication.
