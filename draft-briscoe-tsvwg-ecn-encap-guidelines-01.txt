    Guidelines for Adding Congestion Notification to Protocols that
                             Encapsulate IP
              draft-briscoe-tsvwg-ecn-encap-guidelines-01

Abstract

   The purpose of this document is to guide the design of congestion
   notification in any lower layer or tunnelling protocol that
   encapsulates IP.  The aim is for explicit congestion signals to
   propagate consistently from lower layer protocols into IP.  Then the
   IP internetwork layer can act as a portability layer to carry
   congestion notification from non-IP-aware congested nodes up to the
   transport layer (L4).  Following these guidelines should assure
   interworking between new lower layer congestion notification
   mechanisms, whether specified by the IETF or other standards bodies.

Internet-Draft        ECN Encapsulation Guidelines          October 2012


1.  Introduction

   Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN [RFC3168]) is defined in the IP
   header (v4 & v6) to allow a resource to notify the onset of queue
   build-up without having to drop packets, by explicitly marking a
   proportion of packets with the congestion experienced (CE)
   codepoint.ECN removes nearly all congestion loss and it cuts delays
   for two main reasons: i) it avoids the delays recovering from
   congestion losses, which particularly benefits small flows, making
   their completion time predictably short [RFC2884]; and ii) as ECN is
   used more widely by end-systems, it will gradually remove the need to
   configure a degree of delay into buffers before they start to notify
   congestion (the cause of bufferbloat).  The latter delay is because
   drop involves a trade-off between sending a timely signal and trying
   to avoid impairment, whereas ECN is solely a signal so there is no
   harm triggering it earlier.

   Some lower layer technologies (e.g.  MPLS, Ethernet) are used to form
   large subnetworks with IP-aware nodes only at the edges.
   Particularly now that end-system protocols are finally being deployed
   without their earlier deficiencies, even the buffers of well-
   provisioned interior switches will often need to signal episodes of
   queuing.  However, the above benefits of ECN can only be fully
   realised if the relevant subnetwork technology supports it.
   Propagation of ECN is defined for MPLS [RFC5129], and is being
   defined for TRILL [trill-rbridge-options], but it remains to be
   defined for a number of other subnetwork technologies.

   Similarly, ECN propagation is yet to be defined for many tunnelling
   protocols.  [RFC6040] defines how ECN should be propagated for
   IP-in-IP [RFC2003] and IPsec [RFC4301] tunnels.  However, as Section
   9.3 of RFC3168 pointed out, ECN support will need to be defined for
   other tunnelling protocols, e.g.  L2TP [RFC2661], GRE [RFC1701,
   RFC2784], PPTP [RFC2637] and GTP [GTPv1, GTPv1-U, GTPv2-C].

   The purpose of this document is to guide the addition of congestion
   notification to any subnet technology or tunnelling protocol, so that
   lower layer equipment can signal congestion explicitly and it will
   propagate consistently into encapsulated (higher layer) headers,
   otherwise the signals will not reach their ultimate destination.

   Incremental deployment is the most tricky aspect when adding support
   for ECN.  The original ECN protocol in IP [RFC3168] was carefully
   designed so that a congested buffer would not mark a packet (rather
   than drop it) unless both source and destination hosts were ECN-
   capable.  Otherwise its congestion markings would never be detected
   and congestion would just deteriorate further.  However, to support
   congestion marking below the IP layer, it is not sufficient to only



Briscoe                  Expires April 25, 2013                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft        ECN Encapsulation Guidelines          October 2012


   check that the two end-points support ECN; correct operation also
   depends on the decapsulator propagating congestion notifications
   faithfully.  Otherwise, a legacy decapsulator might silently fail to
   propagate any ECN signals from the outer to the forwarded header.
   Then the lost signals would never be detected and again congestion
   would deteriorate further.  The guidelines given later require
   protocol designers to carefully consider incremental deployment, and
   suggest various safe approaches for different circumstances.

   Of course, the IETF does not have standards authority over every link
   layer protocol.  So this document gives guidelines for designing
   propagation of congestion notification across the interface between
   IP and protocols that may encapsulate IP (i.e. that can be layered
   beneath IP).  Each lower layer technology will exhibit different
   issues and compromises, so the IETF or the relevant standards body
   must be free to define the specifics of each lower layer congestion
   notification scheme.  Nonetheless, if the guidelines are followed,
   congestion notification should interwork between different
   technologies, using IP in its role as a 'portability layer'.

   It has not been possible to give common guidelines for all lower
   layer technologies, because they do not all fit a common pattern.
   Instead they have been divided into a few distinct modes of
   operation: Feed-Forward-and-Upward, Feed-Upward-and-Forward, Feed-
   Backward and Null.  These are described in Section 3, then in the
   following sections separate guidelines are given for each mode.

   This document updates the advice to subnetwork designers about ECN in
   Section 13 of [RFC3819].

1.1.  Scope

   This document only concerns wire protocol processing of explicit
   notification of congestion and makes no changes or recommendations
   concerning algorithms for congestion marking or congestion response.

   This document focuses on the congestion notification interface
   between IP (v4 or v6) and lower layer protocols that can encapsulate
   IP.  However, it is likely that the guidelines will also be useful
   when a lower layer protocol or tunnel encapsulates itself (e.g.
   Ethernet MAC in MAC [IEEE802.1Qah]) or when it encapsulates other
   protocols.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Further terminology used within this document:

   Protocol data unit (PDU):  Information that is delivered as a unit
      among peer entities of a layered network consisting of protocol
      control information (typically a header) and possibly user data
      (payload) of that layer.  The scope of this document includes
      layer 2 and layer 3 networks, where the PDU is respectively termed
      a frame or a packet (or a cell in ATM).  PDU is a general term for
      any of these.  This definition also includes a payload with a shim
      header lying somewhere between layer 2 & 3.

   Transport:  The end-to-end transmission control function,
      conventionally considered at layer-4 in the OSI reference model.
      Given the audience for this document will often use the word
      transport to mean low level bit carriage, whenever the term is
      used it will be qualified, e.g.  'L4 transport'.

   Encapsulator:  The link or tunnel endpoint function that adds an
      outer header to a PDU (also termed the 'link ingress', the 'subnet
      ingress', the 'ingress tunnel endpoint' or just the 'ingress'
      where the context is clear).

   Decapsulator:  The link or tunnel endpoint function that removes an
      outer header from a PDU (also termed the 'link egress', the
      'subnet egress', the 'egress tunnel endpoint' or just the 'egress'
      where the context is clear).

   Incoming header:  The header of an arriving PDU before encapsulation.

   Outer header:  The header added to encapsulate a PDU.

   Inner header:  The header encapsulated by the outer header.

   Outgoing header:  The header forwarded by the decapsulator.

   CE:  Congestion Experienced [RFC3168]

   ECT:  ECN-Capable Transport [RFC3168]

   Not-ECT:  Not ECN-Capable Transport [RFC3168]

   ECN-PDU:  A PDU that is part of a feedback loop within which the
      nodes necessary to propagate explicit congestion notifications
      back to the load regulator are ECN-capable.  This is intended to
      be a general term for a PDU at any layer, not just an IP PDU.  An
      IP packet with a non-zero ECN field would be an ECN-PDU, but the
      term is intended to also be used to describe PDUs of protocols
      that encapsulate IP packets, where it has been checked that the

Internet-Draft        ECN Encapsulation Guidelines          October 2012


      necessary egress nodes and endpoints in the feedback loop for that
      PDU will propagate congestion notification.

   Not-ECN-PDU:  A PDU that is part of a feedback-loop within which some
      nodes necessary to propagate explicit congestion notifications
      back to the load regulator are not ECN-capable.

   Load Regulator:  For each flow of PDUs, the transport function that
      is capable of controlling the data rate.  Typically located at the
      data source, but in-path nodes can regulate load in some
      congestion control arrangements (e.g. admission control or
      policing nodes).  Note the term "a function capable of controlling
      the load" deliberately includes a transport that doesn't actually
      control the load but ought to (e.g. an application without
      congestion control that uses UDP).

   Congestion Baseline:  The location of the function on the path that
      initialised the values of all congestion notification fields in a
      sequence of packets, before any are set to the congestion
      experienced (CE) codepoint if they experience congestion further
      downstream.  Typically the original data source at layer-4.

3.  Modes of Operation

   This section sets down the different modes by which information is
   passed between the lower layer and the higher one.  It acts as a
   reference framework for the following sections, which give normative
   guidelines for designers of explicit congestion notification
   protocols, taking each mode separately in turn:

   Feed-Forward-and-Up:  Nodes feed forward congestion notification
      towards the destination within the lower layer then up the layers
      (like IP does).  The following local optimisation is possible:

      Feed-Up-and-Forward:  A lower layer switch feeds-up congestion
         notification directly into the ECN field in the higher layer
         (IP) header, irrespective of whether it is at the egress of a
         subnet.

   Feed-Backward:  Nodes feed back congestion signals towards the
      ingress of the lower layer and (optionally) attempt to control
      congestion within their own layer.

   Null:  Nodes cannot experience congestion at the lower layer except
      at ingress nodes that are also IP-aware (or equivalently higher-
      layer-aware).

3.1.  Feed-Forward-and-Up Mode

   Many subnet technologies are based on self-contained protocol data
   units (PDUs) or frames sent unreliably.  They provide no feedback
   channel at the subnetwork layer, instead relying on higher layers
   (e.g.  TCP) to feed back loss signals.

   In these cases, ECN may best be supported by standardising explicit
   notification of congestion into the specific link layer protocol.  It
   will then also be necessary to define how the egress of the lower
   layer subnet propagates this explicit signal into the forwarded upper
   layer (IP) header.  It can then continue forwards until it finally
   reaches the destination transport (at L4).  Then typically the
   destination will feed this congestion notification back to the source
   transport using an end-to-end protocol (e.g.  TCP).

   This mode is illustrated in Figure 1.  Along the middle of the
   figure, layers 2, 3 & 4 of the protocol stack are shown, and one
   packet is shown along the bottom as it progresses across the network
   from source to destination, crossing two subnets connected by a
   router, and crossing two switches on the path across each subnet.
   Congestion at the output of the first switch (shown as *) leads to a
   congestion marking in the L2 header (shown as C in the illustration
   of the packet).  The chevrons show the progress of the resulting
   congestion indication.  It is propagated from link to link across the
   subnet in the L2 header, then when the router removes the marked L2
   header, it propagates the marking up into the L3 (IP) header.  The
   router forwards the marked L3 header into subnet 2, and when it adds
   a new L2 header it copies the L3 marking into the L2 header as well,
   as shown by the 'C's in both layers (assuming the technology of
   subnet 2 also supports explicit congestion marking).

   Note that there is no implication that each 'C' marking is encoded
   the same; a different encoding might be used for the 'C' marking in
   each protocol.

   Finally, for completeness, we show the L3 marking arriving at the
   destination, where the host transport protocol (e.g.  TCP) feeds it
   back to the source in the L4 acknowledgement (the 'C' at L4 in the
   packet at the top of the diagram).

   Of course, modern networks are rarely as simple as this text-book
   example, often involving multiple nested layers.  Nonetheless, the
   example illustrates the general idea of feeding congestion
   notification forward then upward whenever a header is removed at the
   egress of a subnet.

   Note that the FECN (forward ECN) bit in Frame Relay and the explicit
   forward congestion indication (EFCI [ITU-T.I.371]) bit in ATM user
   data cells follow a feed-forward pattern.  However, in ATM, this is
   only as part of a feed-forward-and-backward pattern at the lower
   layer, not feed-forward-and-up out of the lower layer--the intention
   was never to interface to IP ECN at the subnet egress.  To our
   knowledge, Frame Relay FECN is solely used to detect where more
   capacity should be provisioned [Buck00].

3.2.  Feed-Up-and-Forward Mode

   Ethernet is particularly difficult to extend incrementally to support
   explicit congestion notification.  One way to support ECN in such
   cases has been to use so called 'layer-3 switches'.  These are
   Ethernet switches that bury into the Ethernet payload to find an IP
   header and manipulate or act on certain IP fields (specifically
   Diffserv & ECN).  For instance, in Data Center TCP [DCTCP], layer-3
   switches are configured to mark the ECN field of the IP header within
   the Ethernet payload when their output buffer becomes congested.
   With respect to switching, a layer-3 switch acts solely on the
   addresses in the Ethernet header; it doesn't use IP addresses, and it
   doesn't decrement the TTL field in the IP header.

     header

                    Figure 2: Feed-Up-and-Forward Mode

   By comparing Figure 2 with Figure 1, it can be seen that subnet E
   (perhaps a subnet of layer-3 Ethernet switches) works in feed-up-and-
   forward mode by notifying congestion directly into L3 at the point of
   congestion, even though the congested switch does not otherwise act
   at L3.  In this example, the technology in subnet F (e.g.  MPLS) does
   support ECN natively, so when the router adds the layer-2 header it
   copies the ECN marking from L3 to L2 as well.

3.3.  Feed-Backward Mode

   In some layer 2 technologies, explicit congestion notification has
   been defined for use internally within the subnet with its own
   feedback and load regulation, but typically the interface with IP for
   ECN has not been defined.

   For instance, for the available bit-rate (ABR) service in ATM, the
   relative rate mechanism was one of the more popular mechanisms for
   managing traffic, tending to supersede earlier designs.  In this
   approach ATM switches send special resource management (RM) cells in
   both the forward and backward directions to control the ingress rate
   of user data into a virtual circuit.  If a switch buffer is
   approaching congestion or congested it sends an RM cell back towards
   the ingress with respectively the No Increase (NI) or Congestion
   Indication (CI) bit set in its message type field [ATM-TM-ABR].  The
   ingress then holds or decreases its sending bit-rate accordingly.

                       Figure 3: Feed-Backward Mode

   ATM's feed-backward approach doesn't fit well when layered beneath
   IP's feed-forward approach--unless the initial data source is the
   same node as the ATM ingress.  Figure 3 shows the feed-backward
   approach being used in subnet H. If the final switch on the path is
   congested (*), it doesn't feed-forward any congestion indications on
   packet (U).  Instead it sends a control cell (V) back to the router
   at the ATM ingress.

   However, the backward feedback doesn't reach the original data source
   directly because IP doesn't support backward feedback (and subnet G
   is independent of subnet H).  Instead, the router in the middle
   throttles down its sending rate but the original data source doesn't
   reduce its rate.  The resulting rate mismatch causes the middle
   router's buffer at layer 3 to back up until it becomes congested,
   which it signals forwards on later data packets at layer 3 (e.g.
   packet W).  Note that the forward signal from the middle router is
   not triggered directly by the backward signal.  Rather, it is
   triggered by congestion resulting from the middle router's mismatched
   rate response to the backward signal.

   In response to this later forward signalling, end-to-end feedback at
   layer-4 finally completes the tortuous path of congestion indications
   back to the origin data source, as before.

3.4.  Null Mode

   Often link and physical layer resources are 'non-blocking' by design.
   In these cases congestion notification may be implemented but it does
   not need to be deployed at the lower layer; ECN in IP would be
   sufficient.

   A degenerate example is a point-to-point Ethernet link.  Excess
   loading of the link merely causes the queue from the higher layer to
   back up, while the lower layer remains immune to congestion.  Even a
   whole meshed subnetwork can be made immune to interior congestion by
   limiting ingress capacity and careful sizing of links, particularly
   if multi-path routing is used to ensure even worst-case patterns of
   load cannot congest any link.

4.  Feed-Forward-and-Up Mode: Guidelines for Adding Congestion
    Notification

   These guidelines are consistent with the guidelines on the design of
   alternate schemes for IP tunnelling of the ECN field [RFC6040] and
   the more general best current practice for the design of alternate
   ECN schemes given in [RFC4774].

   The capitalised term 'SHOULD (NOT)' has often been used in preference
   to 'MUST (NOT)' because it is difficult to know the compromises that
   will be necessary in each protocol design.  If a particular protocol
   design chooses to contradict a 'SHOULD (NOT)' given in the advice
   below, it MUST include a sound justification.

4.1.  Wire Protocol Design: Indication of ECN Support

   A lower layer (or subnet) congestion notification protocol

   1.  SHOULD NOT apply explicit congestion notifications to PDUs that
       are destined for legacy layer-4 transport implementations that
       will not understand ECN, and

   2.  SHOULD NOT apply explicit congestion notifications to PDUs that
       are destined for a legacy subnet egress that will fail to
       propagate them onward into the higher layer.

       We use the term ECN-PDUs for a PDU on a feedback loop that will
       propagate congestion notification properly because it meets both
       these criteria.  And a Not-ECN-PDU is a PDU on a feedback loop



Briscoe                  Expires April 25, 2013                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft        ECN Encapsulation Guidelines          October 2012


       that does not meet both criteria, and will therefore not
       propagate congestion notification properly.  A corollary of the
       above is that a lower layer congestion notification protocol:

   3.  SHOULD be able to distinguish ECN-PDUs from Not-ECN-PDUs.

   In IP, if the ECN field in each PDU is cleared to the Not-ECT (not
   ECN-capable transport) codepoint, it indicates that the L4 transport
   will not understand congestion markings.  A congested buffer must not
   mark these Not-ECT PDUs, and therefore has to drop some.  The
   mechanism a lower layer uses to distinguish the ECN-capability of
   PDUs need not mimic that of IP, but it should achieve the same
   outcome.  For instance, ECN-capable feedback loops might use PDUs
   that are identified by a particular set of labels or tags.
   Alternatively, logical link protocols that use flow state might
   determine whether a PDU can be congestion marked by checking for ECN-
   support in the flow state.

   The per-domain checking of ECN support in MPLS [RFC5129] is a good
   example of a way to avoid sending congestion markings to transports
   that will not understand them--without using any header space in the
   subnet protocol.

   In MPLS, header space is extremely limited, therefore RFC5129 does
   not provide a field in the MPLS header to indicate whether the PDU is
   an ECN-PDU or a Not-ECN-PDU.  Instead, interior nodes in a domain are
   allowed to set explicit congestion indications without checking
   whether the PDU is destined for a transport that will understand
   them.  Nonetheless, this is made safe by requiring that the network
   operator upgrades all decapsulating edges of a whole domain at once,
   if any switch within the domain is configured to mark rather than
   drop during congestion.  Therefore, there will be an implementation
   of an ECN-capable decapsulator on any edge node that might
   decapsulate a packet, which will check whether the higher layer
   transport is ECN-capable.  When decapsulating a CE-marked packet, if
   the decapsulator discovers that the higher layer (inner header)
   indicates the transport is not ECN-capable, it drops the packet on
   behalf of the earlier congested node (see Decapsulation Guideline
   Paragraph 1 in Section 4.3).

   Note that it was only appropriate to define such an incremental
   deployment strategy because MPLS is targeted solely at professional
   operators, who can be expected to ensure that a whole subnetwork is
   consistently configured.  This strategy might not be appropriate for
   other link technologies targeted at zero-configuration deployment or
   deployment by the general public (e.g.  Ethernet).  For such 'plug-
   and-play' environments it will be necessary to invent a failsafe
   approach that ensures congestion markings will never fall into black

   holes, no matter how inconsistently a system is put together.
   Alternatively, congestion notification relying on correct system
   configuration could be confined to flavours of Ethernet intended only
   for professional network operators, such as IEEE 802.1ah Provider
   Backbone Bridges (PBB).

   Note that these guidelines do not require the subnet wire protocol to
   be changed at all to accommodate congestion notification.  Another
   way to add congestion notification without consuming header space in
   the subnet protocol might be to use a control plane protocol in
   parallel.

4.2.  Encapsulation Guidelines

   1.  Egress Capability Check: A subnet ingress needs to be sure that
       the corresponding egress of a subnet will propagate any
       congestion notification added to the outer header across the
       subnet.  This is necessary in addition to checking that an
       incoming PDU indicates an ECN-capable (L4) transport.  Examples
       of how this guarantee might be provided include:

       *  by configuration (e.g. if any label switches in a domain
          support ECN marking, [RFC5129] requires all egress nodes to
          have been configured to propagate ECN)

       *  by the ingress explicitly checking that the egress propagates
          ECN (e.g.  TRILL uses IS-IS to check path capabilities before
          using critical options [trill-rbridge-options])

       *  by inherent design of the protocol (e.g. by encoding ECN
          marking on the outer header in such a way that a legacy egress
          that does not understand ECN will consider the PDU corrupt and
          discard it, thus at least propagating a form of congestion
          signal).

       If the ingress cannot guarantee that the egress will propagate
       congestion notification, the ingress SHOULD disable ECN when it
       forwards the PDU at the lower layer.  An example of how the
       ingress might disable ECN at the lower layer would be by setting
       the outer header of the PDU to identify it as a Not-ECN-PDU.

   2.  Standard Congestion Monitoring Baseline: Once the ingress to a
       subnet has established that the egress will correctly propagate
       ECN, on encapsulation it SHOULD encode the same level of
       congestion in outer headers as is arriving in incoming headers.
       For example it could copy any incoming congestion notification
       into the outer header of the lower layer protocol.




Briscoe                  Expires April 25, 2013                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft        ECN Encapsulation Guidelines          October 2012


       This ensures that all outer headers reflect congestion
       accumulated along the whole upstream path, not just since the
       ingress of the subnet.  More precisely, congestion notifications
       in outer headers SHOULD reflect congestion experienced along the
       whole path since the node that regulates the load for that path
       (the Load Regulator, typically the data source) and no other node
       should re-initialise the amount of CE markings to zero along the
       way.

       This guideline is intended to ensure that any bulk congestion
       monitoring of outer headers (e.g. by a network management node
       monitoring ECN in passing frames) is most meaningful.  For
       instance, if an operator measures CE in 0.4% of passing packets,
       this information is only useful if the operator knows where the
       proportion of CE markings was last initialised to 0% (the
       Congestion Baseline).  Such monitoring information will not be
       useful if some subnet ingress nodes reset all outer CE markings
       while others copy incoming CE markings into the outer.

       Most information can be extracted if the Congestion Baseline is
       standardised at the node that is regulating the load (the Load
       Regulator--typically the data source).  Then the operator can
       measure both congestion since the Load Regulator, and congestion
       since the subnet ingress.  The latter can be measured by
       subtracting the level of CE markings on inner headers from that
       on outer headers.

4.3.  Decapsulation Guidelines

   A subnet egress SHOULD NOT simply copy congestion notification from
   outer headers to the forwarded header.  It SHOULD calculate the
   outgoing congestion notification field from the inner and outer
   headers, using the following rules.  If there is any conflict, rules
   earlier in the list take precedence over rules later in the list:

   1.  If the arriving inner header is a Not-ECN-PDU it implies the L4
       transport will not understand explicit congestion markings.
       Then:

       *  If the outer header carries an explicit congestion marking,
          the packet SHOULD be dropped--the only indication of
          congestion that the L4 transport will understand.

       *  If the outer is an ECN-PDU that carries no indication of
          congestion or a Not-ECN-PDU the PDU SHOULD be forwarded, but
          still as a Not-ECN-PDU.





Briscoe                  Expires April 25, 2013                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft        ECN Encapsulation Guidelines          October 2012


   2.  If the outer header does not support explicit congestion
       notification (a Not-ECN-PDU), but the inner header does (an ECN-
       PDU), the inner header SHOULD be forwarded unchanged.

   3.  In some lower layer protocols congestion may be signalled as a
       numerical level, such as in the control frames of quantised
       congestion notification [IEEE802.1Qau].  If such an encoding
       encapsulates an ECN-capable IP packet, a function will be needed
       to convert the quantised congestion level into the frequency of
       congestion markings in outgoing IP packets.

   4.  Congestion indications may be encoded by a severity level.  For
       instance increasing levels of congestion might be encoded by
       numerically increasing indications, e.g. pre-congestion
       notification (PCN) can be encoded in each PDU at three severity
       levels in IP or MPLS [RFC6660].

       If the arriving inner header is an ECN-PDU, where the inner and
       outer headers carry indications of congestion of different
       severity, the more severe indication SHOULD be forwarded in
       preference to the less severe.  Obviously, if the severities in
       both inner and outer are the same, the same severity should be
       forwarded.

   5.  The inner and outer headers might carry a combination of
       congestion notification fields that should not be possible given
       any currently used protocol transitions.  For instance, if
       Encapsulation Guideline Paragraph 2 in Section 4.2 had been
       followed, it should not be possible to have a less severe
       indication of congestion in the outer than in the inner.  It MAY
       be appropriate to log unexpected combinations of headers and
       possibly raise an alarm.  If a safe outgoing codepoint can be
       defined for such a PDU, the PDU SHOULD be forwarded rather than
       dropped.

       Some implementers discard PDUs with currently unused combinations
       of headers just in case they represent an attack.  However, an
       approach using alarms and policy-mediated drop is preferable to
       hard-coded drop, so that operators can keep track of possible
       attacks but currently unused combinations are not precluded from
       future use through new standards actions.

4.4.  Reframing and Congestion Markings

   Where framing boundaries are different between two layers, congestion
   indications SHOULD be propagated on the basis that a congestion
   indication on a PDU applies to all the octets in the PDU.  On
   average, an encapsulator or decapsulator SHOULD approximately



Briscoe                  Expires April 25, 2013                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft        ECN Encapsulation Guidelines          October 2012


   preserve the number of marked octets arriving and leaving (counting
   the size of inner headers, but not added encapsulating headers).

   The next departing frame SHOULD be immediately marked even if only
   enough incoming marked octets have arrived for part of the departing
   frame.  This ensures that any outstanding congestion marked octets
   are propagated immediately, rather than held back waiting for a frame
   no bigger than the outstanding marked octets--which might involve a
   long wait.

   For instance, an algorithm for marking departing frames could
   maintain a counter representing the balance of arriving marked octets
   minus departing marked octets.  It adds the size of every marked
   frame that arrives and if the counter is positive it marks the next
   frame to depart and subtracts its size from the counter.  This will
   often leave a negative remainder in the counter, which is deliberate.

5.  Feed-Up-and-Forward Mode: Guidelines for Adding Congestion
    Notification

   Marking the IP header while switching at layer-2 (by using a layer-3
   switch) seems to represent a layering violation.  However, it can be
   considered as a benign optimisation if the guidelines below are
   followed.  Feed-up-and-forward is certainly not a general alternative
   to implementing feed-forward congestion notification in the lower
   layer, because:

   o  IPv4 and IPv6 are not the only layer-3 protocols that might be
      encapsulated by lower layer protocols

   o  Link-layer encryption might be in use, making the layer-2 payload
      inaccessible

   o  Many Ethernet switches do not have 'layer-3 switch' capabilities
      so they cannot read and modify an IP payload

   o  It might be costly to find an IP header (v4 or v6) when it may be
      encapsulated by more than one Ethernet header (e.g. when using
      multiple encapsulations of MAC in MAC [IEEE802.1Qah]).

   Nonetheless, configuring a layer-3 switch to look for an ECN field in
   an encapsulated IP header is a useful optimisation.  If the
   implementation follows the guidelines below, this optimisation does
   not have to be confined to a controlled environment such as within a
   data centre; it could usefully be applied on any network--even if the
   operator is not sure whether the above issues will never apply:





Briscoe                  Expires April 25, 2013                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft        ECN Encapsulation Guidelines          October 2012


   1.  If a native lower-layer congestion notification mechanism exists
       for a subnet technology, it is safe to mix feed-up-and-forward
       with feed-forward-and-up on other switches in the same subnet.
       However, it will generally be more efficient to use the native
       mechanism.

   2.  The depth of search for an IP header SHOULD be limited.  If an IP
       header is not found soon enough, or an unrecognised or unreadable
       header is encountered, the switch SHOULD resort to an alternative
       means of signalling congestion (e.g. drop, or the native lower
       layer mechanism if available).

   3.  It is sufficient to use the first IP header found in the stack;
       the egress of the relevant tunnel can propagate congestion
       notification upwards to any more deeply encapsulated IP headers
       later.

6.  Feed-Backward Mode: Guidelines for Adding Congestion Notification

   It can be seen from Section 3.3 that congestion notification in a
   subnet using feed-backward mode has generally not been designed to
   directly coupled with IP layer congestion notification.  The subnet
   attempts to minimise congestion internally, and if the incoming load
   at the ingress exceeds capacity through the subnet, the layer 3
   buffer into the ingress backs up.  Thus, a feed-backward mode subnet
   is in some sense similar to a null mode subnet, in that there is no
   need for any direct interaction between the subnet and higher layer
   congestion notification.  Therefore no detailed protocol design
   guidelines are appropriate.  Nonetheless, a more general guideline is
   appropriate:

   1.  A subnetwork technology intended to eventually interface to IP
       SHOULD NOT be designed using only the feed-backward mode, which
       is certainly best for a stand-alone subnet, but would need to be
       modified to work efficiently as part of the wider Internet,
       because IP uses feed-forward-and-up mode.

   The feed-backward approach does at least work beneath IP, but it can
   result in very inefficient and sluggish congestion control--except if
   it is confined to the subnet directly connected to the original data
   source, when it is faster than feed-forward.  It would be possible to
   design a protocol that could work in feed-backward mode for paths
   that only cross one subnet, and in feed-forward-and-up mode for paths
   that cross subnets.

   In the early days of TCP/IP, a similar feed-backward approach was
   tried for explicit congestion signalling, using source-quench (SQ)
   ICMP control packets.  However, SQ fell out of favour and is now



Briscoe                  Expires April 25, 2013                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft        ECN Encapsulation Guidelines          October 2012


   formally deprecated [RFC6633].  The main problem was that it is hard
   for a data source to tell the difference between a spoofed SQ message
   and a quench request from a genuine buffer on the path.  It is also
   hard for a lower layer buffer to address an SQ message to the
   original source, which may be buried within many layers of headers,
   and possibly encrypted.

   Quantised congestion notification (QCN--also known as backward
   congestion notification or BCN) [IEEE802.1Qau] uses a feed-backward
   mode very similar to ATM.  However, QCN confines its applicability to
   scenarios where all endpoints are directly attached by the same
   Ethernet technology, and is used for example in server area networks
   (SANs).  If a QCN subnet were connected into a wider IP-based
   internetwork (e.g. when attempting to interconnect SANs within
   multiple data centres) it would suffer the same inefficiency as shown
   in Figure 3.

Appendix A.  Outstanding Document Issues

   1.  [GF] Concern that certain guidelines warrant a MUST (NOT) rather
       than a SHOULD (NOT).  Given the guidelines say that if any SHOULD
       (NOT)s are not followed, a strong justification will be needed,
       they have been left as SHOULD (NOT) pending further list
       discussion.  In particular:

       *  If inner is a Not-ECN-PDU and Outer is CE (or highest severity
          congestion level), MUST (not SHOULD) drop?

   2.  [GF] Impact of Diffserv on alternate marking schemes (referring
       to RFC3168, RFC4774 & RFC2983)

   3.  Security Considerations

Appendix B.  Changes in This Version (to be removed by RFC Editor)

   From briscoe-00 to 00:

      *  Intended status: BCP (was Informational) & updates 3819 added.

      *  Briefer Introduction: Introductory para justifying benefits of
         ECN.  Moved all but a brief enumeration of modes of operation
         to their own new section (from both Intro & Scope).  Introduced
         incr. deployment as most tricky part.

      *  Tightened & added to terminology section

      *  Structured with Modes of Operation, then Guidelines section for
         each mode.

      *  Tightened up guideline text to remove vagueness / passive voice
         / ambiguity and highlight main guidelines as numbered items.

      *  Added Outstanding Document Issues Appendix

      *  Updated references
