Abstract

   This memo defines the profile of the MIME Content-Type [MIME-DIR] for
   directory information for a white-pages person object, based on a
   vCard electronic business card. The profile definition is independent
   of any particular directory service or protocol. The profile is
   defined for representing and exchanging a variety of information
   about an individual (e.g., formatted and structured name and delivery
   addresses, email address, multiple telephone numbers, photograph,
   logo, audio clips, etc.). The directory information used by this
   profile is based on the attributes for the person object defined in
   the X.520 and X.521 directory services recommendations. The profile
   also provides the method for including a [VCARD] representation of a
   white-pages directory entry within the MIME Content-Type defined by
   the [MIME-DIR] document.

1.      Overview


   The [MIME-DIR] document defines a MIME Content-Type for holding
   different kinds of directory information. The directory information
   may be based on any of a number of directory schemas. This document
   defines a [MIME-DIR] usage profile for conveying directory
   information based on one such schema; that of the white-pages type of
   person object.

   The schema is based on the attributes for the person object defined
   in the X.520 and X.521 directory services recommendations. The schema
   has augmented the basic attributes defined in the X.500 series
   recommendation in order to provide for an electronic representation
   of the information commonly found on a paper business card. This

                      vCard MIME Directory Profile


   schema was first defined in the [VCARD] document. Hence, this [MIME-
   DIR] profile is referred to as the vCard MIME Directory Profile.

   A directory entry based on this usage profile can include traditional
   directory, white-pages information such as the distinguished name
   used to uniquely identify the entry, a formatted representation of
   the name used for user-interface or presentation purposes, both the
   structured and presentation form of the delivery address, various
   telephone numbers and organizational information associated with the
   entry. In addition, traditional paper business card information such
   as an image of an organizational logo or identify photograph can be
   included in this person object.

   The vCard MIME Directory Profile also provides support for
   representing other important information about the person associated
   with the directory entry. For instance, the date of birth of the
   person; an audio clip describing the pronunciation of the name
   associated with the directory entry, or some other application of the
   digital sound; longitude and latitude geo-positioning information
   related to the person associated with the directory entry; date and
   time that the directory information was last updated; annotations
   often written on a business card; Uniform Resource Locators (URL) for
   a website; public key information. The profile also provides support
   for non-standard extensions to the schema. This provides the
   flexibility for implementations to augment the current capabilities
   of the profile in a standardized way. More information about this
   electronic business card format can be found in [VCARD].

2.      The vCard Mime Directory Profile Registration


   This profile is identified by the following [MIME-DIR] registration
   template information. Subsequent sections define the profile
   definition.

                      vCard MIME Directory Profile


   New parameters: TYPE

   Profile special notes: The type-grouping feature of [MIME-DIR] is
   supported by this profile to group related vCard properties about a
   directory entry. For example, vCard properties describing WORK or
   HOME related characteristics MAY be grouped with a unique group
   label.

   The profile permits the use of non-standard types (i.e., those
   identified with the prefix string "X-") as a flexible method for
   implementations to extend the functionality currently defined within
   this profile.

3.      MIME Directory Features


   The vCard MIME Directory Profile makes use of many of the features
   defined by [MIME-DIR]. The following sections either clarify or
   extend the content-type definition of [MIME-DIR].

3.1     Predefined Type Usage


   The vCard MIME Directory Profile uses the following predefined types
   from [MIME-DIR].

3.1.1   BEGIN and END Type


   The content entity MUST begin with the BEGIN type with a value of
   VCARD. The content entity MUST end with the END type with a value of
   VCARD.

3.1.2   NAME Type


   If the NAME type appears within a MIME entity conforming to this
   profile, it's value is the displayable, presentation text associated
   with the source for the vCard, as specified in the SOURCE type.

3.1.3   PROFILE Type


   If the PROFILE type appears within a MIME entity conforming to this
   profile, it뭩 value must be "VCARD".

3.1.4   SOURCE Type


   If the SOURCE type appears within a MIME entity conforming to this
   profile, it's value provides information how to find the source for
   the vCard.

3.2     Predefined Type Parameter Usage


   The vCard MIME Directory Profile uses the following predefined types
   parameters as defined by [MIME-DIR].

                      vCard MIME Directory Profile


         LANGUAGE

         ENCODING

         VALUE

3.3     VALUE Type Parameter Extensions


   The predefined data type values specified in [MIME-DIR] have been
   extended by the vCard profile to include a number of value types that
   are specific to this profile.

3.3.1   BINARY


   The "binary" value type specifies that the type value is inline,
   encoded binary data. This value type may be specified in the PHOTO,
   LOGO, SOUND, and KEY types.

   If inline, encoded binary data is specified, the ENCODING type
   parameter must be used to specify the encoding format.

   The value type is defined by the following notation:

   binchar = <Any character valid in the base64 or quoted-printable
   encoding>
   binary       = *binchar              ;A base64 or quoted-printable
   encoding of the binary information

3.3.2   VCARD


   The "vcard" value type specifies that the type value is another
   vCard. This value type may be specified in the AGENT type. The value
   type is defined by this specification.

3.3.3   PHONE-NUMBER


   The "phone-number" value type specifies that the type value is a
   telephone number. This value type may be specified in the TEL type.
   The value type is a text value that has the semantics of a telephone
   number.

3.3.4   UTC-OFFSET


   The "utc-offset" value type specifies that the type value is a signed
   offset from UTC. This value type may be specified in the TZ type.

   The format of the offset from UTC is defined by [DATETIME]. The value
   type is an offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). It is
   specified as a positive or negative difference in units of hours and
   minutes (e.g., +hh:mm). The time is specified as a 24-hour clock.
   Hour values are from 00 to 23, and minute values are from 00 to 59.
   Hour and minutes are 2-digits with high order zeroes required to

                      vCard MIME Directory Profile


   maintain digit count. The extended format for ISO 8601 UTC offsets
   MUST be used. The extended format makes use of a colon character as a
   separator of the hour and minute text fields.

   The value is defined by the following notation:

        time-hour       = 2DIGIT        ;00-23
        time-minute     = 2DIGIT        ;00-59
        utc-offset      = ("+" / "-") time-hour ":" time-minute

3.4     Structured Type Values


   Compound type values are delimited by a field delimiter, specified by
   the SEMI-COLON character (ASCII decimal 59). A SEMI-COLON in a
   component of a compound property value must be escaped with a
   BACKSLASH character (ASCII decimal 92).

   Lists of values are delimited by a list delimiter, specified by the
   COMMA character (ASCII decimal 44). A COMMA character in a value must
   be escaped with a BACKSLASH character (ASCII decimal 92).

   This profile supports the type grouping mechanism defined in [MIME-
   DIR]. Grouping of related types is a useful technique to communicate
   common semantics concerning the properties of a vCard.

4.      vCard Profile Features


   The vCard MIME Directory Profile Type contains directory information,
   typically pertaining to a single directory entry. The information is
   described using an attribute schema that is tailored for capturing
   personal contact information. The vCard can include attributes that
   describe identification, delivery addressing, telecommunications
   addressing, geographical, organizational, general explanatory and
   security and access information about the particular object
   associated with the vCard.

4.1     Identification Types


   These types are used in the vCard profile to capture information
   associated with the identification and naming of the person or

4.4.2   GEO Type Definition


   To: ietf-mime-directory@imc.org

   Subject: Registration of application/directory MIME type GEO

   Type name: GEO

   Type purpose: To specify information related to the global
   positioning of the object the vCard represents.

   Type encoding: 8bit.

   Type value: Two float values separated by the SEMI-COLON character
   (ASCII decimal 59).

   Type special notes: This type specifies information related to the
   global position of the object associated with the vCard. The value
   specifies latitude and longitude, in that order (i.e., "LAT LON"
   ordering). The longitude represents the location east and west of the
   prime meridian as a positive or negative real number, respectively.
   The latitude represents the location north and south of the equator
   as a positive or negative real number, respectively. The longitude
   and latitude values must be specified as decimal degrees and should
   be specified to six decimal places. This will allow for granularity
   within a meter of the geographical position. The text components are
   separated by the SEMI-COLON character (ASCII decimal 59). The simple
   formula for converting degrees-minutes-seconds into decimal degrees
   is:

        decimal = degrees + minutes/60 + seconds/3600.

   parameter type may specify any IANA registered public key or
   authentication certificate format. The parameter type may also
   specify a non-standard format.

4.8     Extended Types


   The types defined by this document can be extended with private types
   using the non-standard, private values mechanism defined in [RFC-
   2045]. Non-standard, private types with a name starting with "X-" may
   be defined bilaterally between two cooperating agents without outside
   registration or standardization.

5.      Differences With vCard v2.1


   This specification has been reviewed by the IETF community. The
   review process introduced a number of differences with the [VCARD]
   version 2.1. These differences are minor, but require that vCard
   objects conforming to this specification have a different version
   number than a vCard conforming to [VCARD]. The differences include
   the following:

         VERSION value corresponding to this specification must be
          "2.2".

         The [MIME-DIR] predefined types of PROFILE, SOURCE, NAME are
          allowed.

         The [MIME-DIR] VALUE type parameter for value data typing is
          allowed.

         The [VCARD] CHARSET type parameter has been eliminated.
          Character set may only be specified on the CHARSET parameter
          on the Content-Type MIME header field.

         The [VCARD] support for non-signficant LWSP character been
          eliminated. All LWSP is significant in this specification.

         LOGO, PHOTO and SOUND multimedia formats need to be either
          IANA registered types or non-standard types.

         TEL values may be identified as personal communication
          services telephone numbers with the PCS type parameter value.

         The PRODID, CATEGORIES and CLASS types have been added.

6.      Formal Grammar


   The following formal grammar is provided to assist developers in
   building parsers for the vCard.

   This syntax is written according to the form described in RFC 822,
   but it references just this small subset of RFC 822 literals:
