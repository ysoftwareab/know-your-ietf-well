1. Introduction

1.1. Background and motivation - Status of (D)TLS terminology

   The definition of the TLS protocol [RFC5246] is slightly unusual in
   the area of protocol specifications, because more like a software
   description with a high-level data model, perhaps written after an
   implementation.  The RFC does not provide explicit definitions for
   the main terms, rather providing a glossary in Appendix B/[RFC5246].
   The Glossary itself provides descriptions of the main terms, but not
   any definitions.  At least not definitions at the detailed level as
   required for protocol specifications, which implies a precise
   linkage to objects as e.g. used within protocol and service data
   units and protocol control information elements.

   E.g., there are concerns and ongoing debates about the semantics of
   some "handshake" related protocol procedures (catchwords "re-
   establishment", "resumption", "renegotiation", "rekeying").
   Associated to these procedural aspects is the underlying question
   concerning the precise distinction between (D)TLS session and (D)TLS
   connection level.

   Without any doubt, TLS itself is a pretty successful, mature and
   well-proven technology.  The production of (D)TLS term definition
   implies hence reverse engineering of (D)TLS RFCs.

1.2. Purpose

   The purpose of this document is to provide a central place of key
   terms as used in TLS and DTLS RFCs.  The definitions should be
   concise, but detailed enough from perspective of a protocol model,
   and of course fully consistent and compatible with the existing
   RFCs.

1.3. Scope

   The focus is put on key terms which caused some controversy so far.

1.4. Relation with Internet Security Glossary

   The Internet Security Glossary [RFC4949] provides a comprehensive
   set of security related terms.  However, protocol specific terms



Guballa               Expires September 26, 2015               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft   Terminology related to TLS and DTLS         March 2015


   such as for DTLS and TLS are not part of the glossary.  Hence, there
   is actually not any overlapping between this document and [RFC4949].

1.5. Disclaimer

   Where there are discrepancies between this document and existing
   RFCs on TLS and DTLS, the usage and "semantics" of these (D)TLS RFCs
   take precedence over those described in this document.

2. Conventions used in this document

2.1. Prescriptive language: modal verbs

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

2.2. Notion of '(D)TLS'

   The prefix '(D)TLS' indicate terms common to both protocols.  The
   prefixes 'TLS' and 'DTLS' indicate protocol specific aspects.

3. Inventory of (D)TLS terms



3.1. Terminology related to endpoint entities

3.1.1. Term "(D)TLS endpoint"

   Definition:

     An instance of a (D)TLS protocol implementation with exactly one
     local IP (transport) address.  A (D)TLS endpoint is housing one or
     multiple (D)TLS connection endpoints, which are acting either as
     (D)TLS clients or as (D)TLS servers (i.e., "(D)TLS client
     connection endpoint" and "(D)TLS server connection endpoint") when
     executing the (D)TLS handshake protocol.

   Reference:

     None.

   Term relations:

     Definition based on terms "(D)TLS protocol implementation"
     (3.1.2.), "(D)TLS client connection endpoint" (3.3.3.), and
     "(D)TLS server connection endpoint" (3.3.4.).

3.1.2. Term "(D)TLS protocol implementation"

   Definition:

     A (software or hardware) based implementation of the TLS protocol
     as specified in [RFC5246] or of the DTLS protocol as specified in
     [RFC6347] (DTLS) and is always associated to a real system.

   Reference:

     [RFC5246] and [RFC6347].

Internet-Draft   Terminology related to TLS and DTLS         March 2015


   Term relations:

     Definition based on term "real system" [ITU-T X.200].



3.2. Terminology related to session/connection entities

3.2.1. Term "(D)TLS connection"

   Definition:

     A cooperative relationship among a pair of (D)TLS capable systems,
     represented by a (D)TLS client connection endpoint and a (D)TLS
     server connection endpoint (NOTE 1).  A (D)TLS connection allows
     the execution of an establishment procedure given by either a
     (D)TLS full handshake or a (D)TLS abbreviated handshake (on
     request of the (D)TLS served user instance at (D)TLS client side).
     Thus, the mode of communication of the (D)TLS connection could be
     considered as connection-oriented (i.e., a (D)TLS connection is
     stateful, e.g., at the top-level by the 2-state model {IDLE,
     ESTABLISHED}).

   Notes:

     Thus, formally the (D)TLS connection is a set of two 8-tuples,
     refer to "(D)TLS connection endpoint".

   Reference:

     The term "connection" is part of the glossary of [RFC5246].

   Term relations:

     Definition based on terms "(D)TLS protocol implementation"
     (3.1.2.), "(D)TLS client connection endpoint" (3.3.3.), and
     "(D)TLS server connection endpoint" (3.3.4.).

3.2.2. Term "Semi-permannt (D)TLS session"

   Definition:

     The pair of a semi-permanent (D)TLS client session endpoint state
     and a semi-permanent (D)TLS server session endpoint state, coupled
     by the (D)TLS full handshake procedure which was executed across
     the associated (D)TLS connection.

Internet-Draft   Terminology related to TLS and DTLS         March 2015


   Reference:

     None.

   Term relations:

     Definition based on terms "semi-permanent (D)TLS client session
     endpoint state" (3.4.8.), "semi-permanent (D)TLS server session
     endpoint state" (3.4.9.), "(D)TLS full handshake" (3.4.5.), and
     "(D)TLS connection" (3.2.1.).

3.2.3. Term "Transient (D)TLS session"

   Definition:

     The pair of a transient (D)TLS client session endpoint state and a
     transient (D)TLS server session endpoint state, coupled by the
     (D)TLS full handshake procedure which was executed across the
     associated (D)TLS connection.

     The transient (D)TLS client session endpoint state information and
     transient (D)TLS server session endpoint state information is
     immediately deleted after the successful (D)TLS full handshake
     procedure.

   Reference:

     None.

   Term relations:

     Definition based on terms "transient (D)TLS client session
     endpoint state" (3.4.10.), "transient (D)TLS server session
     endpoint state" (3.4.11.), "(D)TLS full handshake" (3.4.5.), and
     "(D)TLS connection" (3.2.1.).

3.2.4. Term "(D)TLS session"

   Definition:

     A semi-permanent (D)TLS session or transient (D)TLS session.

   Notes:

     Thus, a (D)TLS session is a transformed (D)TLS connection after
     the successful execution of a (D)TLS full handshake procedure,
     constituted by the pair of (D)TLS client session endpoint state


Guballa               Expires September 26, 2015               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft   Terminology related to TLS and DTLS         March 2015


     and a (D)TLS server session endpoint state.  A (D)TLS session is
     consequently an association between the two (D)TLS session
     endpoints.  The mode of communication of the (D)TLS session could
     be considered as connectionless (i.e., a (D)TLS session is either
     existing or not).

     The nature of a (D)TLS session (from (D)TLS endpoint perspective)
     is either volatile (i.e., the local (D)TLS session information
     would be immediately discarded after a (D)TLS handshake procedure)
     or semi-permanent (in case of resumable (D)TLS sessions).

     Notably, a (D)TLS session may still exist after one or even both
     (D)TLS connection endpoints, which did exchange the (D)TLS full
     handshake messages from which the related (D)TLS session states
     were derived from, are already destroyed.

     The (D)TLS role (client or server) is a (D)TLS session level
     characteristic. (to be confirmed)

   Reference:

     The term "session" is part of the glossary of [RFC5246].

   Term relations:

     Definition based on terms "(D)TLS semi-permanent session"
     (3.2.2.), and "(D)TLS transient (volatile) session" (3.2.3.).

3.2.5. Term "DTLS association"

   Definition:

     Synonym to "DTLS connection".

   Reference:

     Term introduced by [RFC4347] and still used in [RFC6347].

   Term relations:

     Definition equal to "(D)TLS connection" (3.2.1.).

3.3. Terminology related to session/connection endpoint entities

3.3.1. Term "(D)TLS connection endpoint"

   Definition:

     A part of an instance of a (D)TLS protocol implementation, which
     is able to send and receive (D)TLS messages, and which is
     associated to exactly one 8-tuple being composed of

     1)  a creation point in time tc,

     2)  a destruction point in time td,

     3)  a non-empty local IP address AL,

     4)  a non-empty local L4 port PL,

     5)  an empty or non-empty remote IP address AR,

     6)  an empty or non-empty remote L4 port PR,

     7)  a non-empty L4 transport protocol T, and

     8)  the protocol string "TLS" or "DTLS".

   Notes:

     If FQDNs are used as (D)TLS endpoint identifiers, then an
     additional requirement on the (D)TLS connection endpoint could be
     that AL is one of the IP addresses associated to the (D)TLS
     endpoint's FQDN.

     "TLS"/"DTLS"} from the (D)TLS connection endpoint.

   Notes:

3.4.17. Term "Resumed (D)TLS session"

   Definition:

     A resumable (D)TLS session after the successful execution of a
     (D)TLS abbreviated handshake procedure.

   Notes:

     1: The (D)TLS session identifier value (of the resumed (D)TLS
     session) is identical to the previous value of the resumable
     (D)TLS session.

     2: The (D)TLS connection, which is established with the (D)TLS
     abbreviated handshake based on the existing resumable (D)TLS
     session, may be created while the original (D)TLS connection,
     which was established via the (D)TLS full handshake from which the
     resumable (D)TLS client and server session endpoint states and
     hence the resumable (D)TLS session were derived, is still
     established, or only after this original (D)TLS connection is
     already terminated.

     3: Several new (D)TLS connections may be established using (D)TLS
     abbreviated handshakes based on the same resumable (D)TLS session.
     If the first (D)TLS connection is established using an (D)TLS
     abbreviated handshake based on a resumable (D)TLS session, then we
     may say that this (D)TLS session becomes a resumed (D)TLS session
     at this first (D)TLS abbreviated handshake's end time.

     A (D)TLS session level concept which leads, - by the execution of
     a (D)TLS handshake procedure (full or abbreviated) -, to the
     update of the (D)TLS protocol status "connection-level"
     information of an DATA TRANSFER READY (D)TLS connection, for the

   Notes:

     1: The initial (D)TLS full handshake or (D)TLS abbreviated
     handshake is not regarded as a (D)TLS session renegotiation as
     this handshake is executed on a (D)TLS connection which is in the
     state IDLE.  After this initial handshake is finished the (D)TLS
     connection state is changed to DATA TRANSFER READY, and thus all
     following (D)TLS full handshakes or (D)TLS abbreviated handshakes
     on that (D)TLS connection are regarded as (D)TLS session
     renegotiation.  The (D)TLS handshake related to a (D)TLS session
     renegotiation is always cryptographically protected by the current
     (D)TLS connection state.2: The (D)TLS connection state remains in
     DATA TRANSFER READY during and after the (D)TLS session
     renegotiation.

3.4.19. Term "(D)TLS session resumption"

     A (D)TLS session level concept which represents the execution of a
     (D)TLS abbreviated handshake procedure on an existing (D)TLS
     session, i.e., a semi-permanent (D)TLS session, for the purpose of
     either deriving a further DATA TRANSFER READY (D)TLS connection or

3.4.20. Term "(D)TLS session identifier"

   Definition:

   Notes:

     1: The definition is consistent and not redefining the explanatory
     description of a "session identifier" in the TLS glossary, as
     contained in Appendix B/[RFC5246].

     2: This definition may need to be extended by additional
     consideration of the session ticket based TLS session resumption
     mechanism as defined in [RFC5077].  There would be then two TLS
     protocol parameters (session_id and SessionTicket) as possible
     identifiers (both protocol parameters are mutually exclusive).
