           The Incident Object Description Exchange Format v2
                     draft-ietf-mile-rfc5070-bis-05

Abstract

   The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) defines a
   data representation that provides a framework for sharing information
   commonly exchanged by Computer Security Incident Response Teams
   (CSIRTs) about computer security incidents.  This document describes
   the information model for the IODEF and provides an associated data
   model specified with XML Schema.

1.  Introduction

   Organizations require help from other parties to mitigate malicious
   activity targeting their network and to gain insight into potential
   threats.  This coordination might entail working with an ISP to
   filter attack traffic, contacting a remote site to take down a bot-
   network, or sharing watch-lists of known malicious IP addresses in a
   consortium.

   The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) is a format
   for representing computer security information commonly exchanged
   between Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs).  It
   provides an XML representation for conveying:

   o  cyber intelligence to characterize threats;

   o  cyber incident reports to document particular cyber security
      events or relationships between events;

   o  cyber event mitigation to request proactive and reactive
      mitigation approaches to cyber intelligence or incidents; and

   o  cyber information sharing meta-data so that these various classes
      of information can be exchanged among parties.

Internet-Draft                    IODEF                     January 2014


   The data model encodes information about hosts, networks, and the
   services running on these systems; attack methodology and associated
   forensic evidence; impact of the activity; and limited approaches for
   documenting workflow.

   The overriding purpose of the IODEF is to enhance the operational
   capabilities of CSIRTs.  Community adoption of the IODEF provides an
   improved ability to resolve incidents and convey situational
   awareness by simplifying collaboration and data sharing.  This
   structured format provided by the IODEF allows for:

   o  increased automation in processing of incident data, since the
      resources of security analysts to parse free-form textual
      documents will be reduced;

   o  decreased effort in normalizing similar data (even when highly
      structured) from different sources; and

   o  a common format on which to build interoperable tools for incident
      handling and subsequent analysis, specifically when data comes
      from multiple constituencies.

   Coordinating with other CSIRTs is not strictly a technical problem.
   There are numerous procedural, trust, and legal considerations that
   might prevent an organization from sharing information.  The IODEF
   does not attempt to address them.  However, operational
   implementations of the IODEF will need to consider this broader
   context.

   Sections 3 and 8 specify the IODEF data model with text and an XML
   schema.  The types used by the data model are covered in Section 2.
   Processing considerations, the handling of extensions, and
   internationalization issues related to the data model are covered in
   Sections 4, 5, and 6, respectively.  Examples are listed in
   Section 7.  Section 1 provides the background for the IODEF, and
   Section 9 documents the security considerations.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST," "MUST NOT," "REQUIRED," "SHALL," "SHALL NOT,"
   "SHOULD," "SHOULD NOT," "RECOMMENDED," "MAY," and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Definitions for some of the common computer security-related
   terminology used in this document can be found in Section 2 of
   [refs.requirements].

1.3.  Notations

   The normative IODEF data model is specified with the text in
   Section 3 and the XML schema in Section 8.  To help in the
   understanding of the data elements, Section 3 also depicts the
   underlying information model using Unified Modeling Language (UML).
   This abstract presentation of the IODEF is not normative.

   For clarity in this document, the term "XML document" will be used
   when referring generically to any instance of an XML document.  The
   term "IODEF document" will be used to refer to specific elements and
   attributes of the IODEF schema.  The terms "class" and "element" will

   be used interchangeably to reference either the corresponding data
   element in the information or data models, respectively.

1.4.  About the IODEF Data Model

   The IODEF data model is a data representation that provides a
   framework for sharing information commonly exchanged by CSIRTs about
   computer security incidents.  A number of considerations were made in
   the design of the data model.

   o  The data model serves as a transport format.  Therefore, its
      specific representation is not the optimal representation for on-
      disk storage, long-term archiving, or in-memory processing.

   o  As there is no precise widely agreed upon definition for an
      incident, the data model does not attempt to dictate one through
      its implementation.  Rather, a broad understanding is assumed in
      the IODEF that is flexible enough to encompass most operators.

   o  Describing an incident for all definitions would require an
      extremely complex data model.  Therefore, the IODEF only intends
      to be a framework to convey commonly exchanged incident
      information.  It ensures that there are ample mechanisms for
      extensibility to support organization-specific information, and
      techniques to reference information kept outside of the explicit
      data model.

   o  The domain of security analysis is not fully standardized and must
      rely on free-form textual descriptions.  The IODEF attempts to
      strike a balance between supporting this free-form content, while
      still allowing automated processing of incident information.

   o  The IODEF is only one of several security relevant data
      representations being standardized.  Attempts were made to ensure
      they were complementary.  The data model of the Intrusion
      Detection Message Exchange Format [RFC4765] influenced the design
      of the IODEF.

   Further discussion of the desirable properties for the IODEF can be
   found in the Requirements for the Format for Incident Information
   Exchange (FINE) [refs.requirements].

1.5.  About the IODEF Implementation

   The IODEF implementation is specified as an Extensible Markup
   Language (XML) [W3C.XML] Schema [W3C.SCHEMA].

Internet-Draft                    IODEF                     January 2014


   Implementing the IODEF in XML provides numerous advantages.  Its
   extensibility makes it ideal for specifying a data encoding framework
   that supports various character encodings.  Likewise, the abundance
   of related technologies (e.g., XSL, XPath, XML-Signature) makes for
   simplified manipulation.  However, XML is fundamentally a text
   representation, which makes it inherently inefficient when binary
   data must be embedded or large volumes of data must be exchanged.

2.  IODEF Data Types

   The various data elements of the IODEF data model are typed.  This
   section discusses these data types.  When possible, native Schema
   data types were adopted, but for more complicated formats, regular
   expressions (see Appendix F of [W3C.SCHEMA.DTYPES]) or external
   standards were used.

2.1.  Integers

   An integer is represented by the INTEGER data type.  Integer data
   MUST be encoded in Base 10.

   The INTEGER data type is implemented as an "xs:integer" in
   [W3C.SCHEMA.DTYPES].

2.2.  Real Numbers

   Real (floating-point) attributes are represented by the REAL data
   type.  Real data MUST be encoded in Base 10.

   The REAL data type is implemented as an "xs:float" in
   [W3C.SCHEMA.DTYPES].

2.3.  Characters and Strings

   A single character is represented by the CHARACTER data type.  A
   character string is represented by the STRING data type.  Special
   characters must be encoded using entity references.  See Section 4.1.

   The CHARACTER and STRING data types are implement as an "xs:string"
   in [W3C.SCHEMA.DTYPES].

2.4.  Multilingual Strings

   STRING data that represents multi-character attributes in a language
   different than the default encoding of the document is of the
   ML_STRING data type.

   The ML_STRING data type is implemented as an "iodef:MLStringType" in
   the schema.

2.5.  Bytes

   A binary octet is represented by the BYTE data type.  A sequence of
   binary octets is represented by the BYTE[] data type.  These octets
   are encoded using base64.

   The BYTE data type is implemented as an "xs:base64Binary" in
   [W3C.SCHEMA.DTYPES].

2.6.  Hexadecimal Bytes

   A binary octet is represented by the HEXBIN (and HEXBIN[]) data type.
   This octet is encoded as a character tuple consisting of two
   hexadecimal digits.

   The HEXBIN data type is implemented as an "xs:hexBinary" in
   [W3C.SCHEMA.DTYPES].

2.7.  Enumerated Types

   Enumerated types are represented by the ENUM data type, and consist
   of an ordered list of acceptable values.  Each value has a
   representative keyword.  Within the IODEF schema, the enumerated type
   keywords are used as attribute values.

   The ENUM data type is implemented as a series of "xs:NMTOKEN" in the
   schema.

2.8.  Date-Time Strings

   Date-time strings are represented by the DATETIME data type.  Each
   date-time string identifies a particular instant in time; ranges are
   not supported.

   Date-time strings are formatted according to a subset of [ISO8601]
   documented in [RFC3339].

   The DATETIME data type is implemented as an "xs:dateTime" in the
   schema.

2.9.  Timezone String

   A timezone offset from UTC is represented by the TIMEZONE data type.
   It is formatted according to the following regular expression:
   "Z|[\+\-](0[0-9]|1[0-4]):[0-5][0-9]".

Internet-Draft                    IODEF                     January 2014


   The TIMEZONE data type is implemented as an "xs:string" with a
   regular expression constraint in [W3C.SCHEMA.DTYPES].  This regular
   expression is identical to the timezone representation implemented in
   an "xs:dateTime".

2.10.  Port Lists

   A list of network ports are represented by the PORTLIST data type.  A
   PORTLIST consists of a comma-separated list of numbers and ranges
   (N-M means ports N through M, inclusive).  It is formatted according
   to the following regular expression: "\d+(\-\d+)?(,\d+(\-\d+)?)*".
   For example, "2,5-15,30,32,40-50,55-60".

   The PORTLIST data type is implemented as an "xs:string" with a
   regular expression constraint in the schema.

2.11.  Postal Address

   A postal address is represented by the POSTAL data type.  This data
   type is an ML_STRING whose format is documented in Section 2.23 of
   [RFC4519].  It defines a postal address as a free-form multi-line
   string separated by the "$" character.

   The POSTAL data type is implemented as an "xs:string" in the schema.

2.12.  Person or Organization

   The name of an individual or organization is represented by the NAME
   data type.  This data type is an ML_STRING whose format is documented
   in Section 2.3 of [RFC4519].

   The NAME data type is implemented as an "xs:string" in the schema.

2.13.  Telephone and Fax Numbers

   A telephone or fax number is represented by the PHONE data type.  The
   format of the PHONE data type is documented in Section 2.35 of
   [RFC4519].

   The PHONE data type is implemented as an "xs:string" in the schema.

2.14.  Email String

   An email address is represented by the EMAIL data type.  The format
   of the EMAIL data type is documented in Section 3.4.1 [RFC5322].

   The EMAIL data type is implemented as an "xs:string" in the schema.

2.15.  Uniform Resource Locator strings

   A uniform resource locator (URL) is represented by the URL data type.
   The format of the URL data type is documented in [RFC3986].

   The URL data type is implemented as an "xs:anyURI" in the schema.

3.  The IODEF Data Model

   In this section, the individual components of the IODEF data model
   will be discussed in detail.  For each class, the semantics will be
   described and the relationship with other classes will be depicted
   with UML.  When necessary, specific comments will be made about
   corresponding definition in the schema in Section 8

3.1.  IODEF-Document Class

   The IODEF-Document class is the top level class in the IODEF data
   model.  All IODEF documents are an instance of this class.

   +-----------------+
   | IODEF-Document  |
   +-----------------+
   | STRING version  |<>--{1..*}--[ Incident       ]
   | ENUM lang       |<>--{0..*}--[ AdditionalData ]
   | STRING formatid |
   +-----------------+

                      Figure 1: IODEF-Document Class

   The aggregate class that constitute IODEF-Document is:

   Incident
      One or more.  The information related to a single incident.

   AdditionalData
      Zero or more.  Mechanism by which to extend the data model.  See
      Section 3.9

   The IODEF-Document class has three attributes:

   version
      Required.  STRING.  The IODEF specification version number to
      which this IODEF document conforms.  The value of this attribute
      MUST be "2.00"

      Required.  ENUM.  A valid language code per [RFC4646] constrained
      by the definition of "xs:language".  The interpretation of this
      code is described in Section 6.

   formatid
      Optional.  STRING.  A free-form string to convey processing
      instructions to the recipient of the document.  Its semantics must
      be negotiated out-of-band.

3.2.  Incident Class

   Every incident is represented by an instance of the Incident class.
   This class provides a standardized representation for commonly
   exchanged incident data.

   +-------------------------+
   | Incident                |
   +-------------------------+
   | ENUM purpose            |<>----------[ IncidentID      ]

   |                         |<>--{0..*}--[ AdditionalData  ]
   +-------------------------+

                       Figure 2: The Incident Class

   The aggregate classes that constitute Incident are:

   IncidentID
      One.  An incident tracking number assigned to this incident by the
      CSIRT that generated the IODEF document.

   AlternativeID

   The Incident class has five attributes:

   purpose
      Required.  ENUM.  The purpose attribute represents the reason why
      the IODEF document was created.  It is closely related to the
      Expectation class (Section 3.16).  This attribute is defined as an
      enumerated list:

      1.  traceback.  The document was sent for trace-back purposes.

      2.  mitigation.  The document was sent to request aid in
          mitigating the described activity.

      3.  reporting.  The document was sent to comply with reporting
          requirements.

      4.  watch.  The document was sent to convey indicators to watch
          for particular activity.

      5.  other.  The document was sent for purposes specified in the
          Expectation class.

      6.  ext-value.  An escape value used to extend this attribute.
          See Section 5.1.

   ext-purpose
      Optional.  STRING.  A means by which to extend the purpose
      attribute.  See Section 5.1.

   lang
      Optional.  ENUM.  A valid language code per [RFC4646] constrained
      by the definition of "xs:language".  The interpretation of this
      code is described in Section 6.

   restriction
      Optional.  ENUM.  See Section 3.3.1.

   indicator-uid
      Optional.  STRING.  See Section 3.3.2.

   indicator-set-id
      Optional.  STRING.  See Section 3.3.2.

3.3.  Common Attributes

   There are a number of recurring attributes used by the data model.
   They are documented in this section.

3.3.1.  restriction Attribute

   The restriction attribute indicates the disclosure guidelines to
   which the sender expects the recipient to adhere for the information
   represented in this class and its children.  This guideline provides
   no security since there are no specified technical means to ensure
   that the recipient of the document handles the information as the
   sender requested.

Internet-Draft                    IODEF                     January 2014


   The value of this attribute is logically inherited by the children of
   this class.  That is to say, the disclosure rules applied to this
   class, also apply to its children.

   It is possible to set a granular disclosure policy, since all of the
   high-level classes (i.e., children of the Incident class) have a
   restriction attribute.  Therefore, a child can override the
   guidelines of a parent class, be it to restrict or relax the
   disclosure rules (e.g., a child has a weaker policy than an ancestor;
   or an ancestor has a weak policy, and the children selectively apply
   more rigid controls).  The implicit value of the restriction
   attribute for a class that did not specify one can be found in the
   closest ancestor that did specify a value.

   This attribute is defined as an enumerated value with a default value
   of "private".  Note that the default value of the restriction
   attribute is only defined in the context of the Incident class.  In
   other classes where this attribute is used, no default is specified.

   1.  public.  The information can be freely distributed without
       restriction.

   2.  partner.  The information may be shared within a closed community
       of peers, partners, or affected parties, but cannot be openly
       published.

   3.  need-to-know.  The information may be shared only within the
       organization with individuals that have a need to know.

   4.  private.  The information may not be shared.

   5.  default.  The information can be shared according to an
       information disclosure policy pre-arranged by the communicating
       parties.

   6.  white.  Same as 'public'.

   7.  green.  Same as 'partner'.

   8.  amber.  Same as 'need-to-know'.

   9.  red.  Same as 'private'.

3.3.2.  Indicator Attributes

   For data elements that are commonly used as indicators, the data
   model uses four attributes to facilitate their ...

   indicator-uid
      STRING.  See Section 3.3.2.

   indicator-set-id
      STRING.  See Section 3.3.2.

3.4.  IncidentID Class

   The IncidentID class represents an incident tracking number that is
   unique in the context of the CSIRT and identifies the activity
   characterized in an IODEF Document.  This identifier would serve as
   an index into the CSIRT incident handling system.  The combination of
   the name attribute and the string in the element content MUST be a
   globally unique identifier describing the activity.  Documents
   generated by a given CSIRT MUST NOT reuse the same value unless they
   are referencing the same incident.

   +------------------+
   | IncidentID       |
   +------------------+
   | STRING           |
   |                  |
   | STRING name      |
   | STRING instance  |
   | ENUM restriction |
   +------------------+

                      Figure 3: The IncidentID Class

   The IncidentID class has three attributes:

   name
      Required.  STRING.  An identifier describing the CSIRT that
      created the document.  In order to have a globally unique CSIRT
      name, the fully qualified domain name associated with the CSIRT
      MUST be used.

   instance
      Optional.  STRING.  An identifier referencing a subset of the
      named incident.

   restriction
      Optional.  ENUM.  See Section 3.3.1.  The default value is
      "public".

3.5.  AlternativeID Class

   The AlternativeID class lists the incident tracking numbers used by
   CSIRTs, other than the one generating the document, to refer to the
   identical activity described in the IODEF document.  A tracking
   number listed as an AlternativeID references the same incident
   detected by another CSIRT.  The incident tracking numbers of the
   CSIRT that generated the IODEF document must never be considered an
   AlternativeID.

   +------------------+
   | AlternativeID    |
   +------------------+
   | ENUM restriction |<>--{1..*}--[ IncidentID ]
   |                  |
   +------------------+

                     Figure 4: The AlternativeID Class

   The aggregate class that constitutes AlternativeID is:

   IncidentID
      One or more.  The incident tracking number of another CSIRT.

   The AlternativeID class has one attribute:

   restriction
      Optional.  ENUM.  This attribute has been defined in Section 3.2.

3.6.  RelatedActivity Class

   The RelatedActivity class relates the information described in the
   rest of the IODEF document to previously observed incidents or
   activity; and allows attribution to a specific actor or campaign.

   +------------------+
   | RelatedActivity  |
   +------------------+
   | ENUM restriction |<>--{0..*}--[ IncidentID     ]
   |                  |<>--{0..*}--[ URL            ]

   restriction
      Optional.  ENUM.  See Section 3.3.1.

3.9.  AdditionalData Class

   The AdditionalData class serves as an extension mechanism for
   information not otherwise represented in the data model.  For
   relatively simple information, atomic data types (e.g., integers,
   strings) are provided with a mechanism to annotate their meaning.
   The class can also be used to extend the data model (and the
   associated Schema) to support proprietary extensions by encapsulating
   entire XML documents conforming to another Schema.  A detailed
   discussion for extending the data model and the schema can be found
   in Section 5.

   Unlike XML, which is self-describing, atomic data must be documented
   to convey its meaning.  This information is described in the
   'meaning' attribute.  Since these description are outside the scope
   of the specification, some additional coordination may be required to
   ensure that a recipient of a document using the AdditionalData
   classes can make sense of the custom extensions.

   +------------------+
   | AdditionalData   |
   +------------------+
   | ANY              |
   |                  |
   | ENUM dtype       |
   | STRING ext-dtype |
   | STRING meaning   |
   | STRING formatid  |
   | ENUM restriction |
   +------------------+

                    Figure 8: The AdditionalData Class

   The AdditionalData class has five attributes:

   dtype
      Required.  ENUM.  The data type of the element content.  The
      permitted values for this attribute are shown below.  The default
      value is "string".

      1.   boolean.  The element content is of type BOOLEAN.

      2.   byte.  The element content is of type BYTE.

3.10.  Contact Class

   The Contact class describes contact information for organizations and
   personnel involved in the incident.  This class allows for the naming
   of the involved party, specifying contact information for them, and
   identifying their role in the incident.

   People and organizations are treated interchangeably as contacts; one
   can be associated with the other using the recursive definition of
   the class (the Contact class is aggregated into the Contact class).
   The 'type' attribute disambiguates the type of contact information
   being provided.

   The inheriting definition of Contact provides a way to relate
   information without requiring the explicit use of identifiers in the
   classes or duplication of data.  A complete point of contact is
   derived by a particular traversal from the root Contact class to the
   leaf Contact class.  As such, multiple points of contact might be
   specified in a single instance of a Contact class.  Each child
   Contact class logically inherits contact information from its
   ancestors.

                        Figure 9: The Contact Class

   The aggregate classes that constitute the Contact class are:

   ContactName
      Zero or one.  ML_STRING.  The name of the contact.  The contact
      may either be an organization or a person.  The type attribute
      disambiguates the semantics.

      Zero or one.  ML_STRING.  The title for the individual named in
      the ContactName.

   Description
      Zero or many.  ML_STRING.  A free-form description of this
      contact.  In the case of a person, this is often the
      organizational title of the individual.

   RegistryHandle

   Timezone
      Zero or one.  TIMEZONE.  The timezone in which the contact resides
      formatted according to Section 2.9.

   Contact
      Zero or many.  A Contact instance contained within another Contact
      instance inherits the values of the parent(s).  This recursive
      definition can be used to group common data pertaining to multiple
      points of contact and is especially useful when listing multiple
      contacts at the same organization.

   AdditionalData
      Zero or many.  A mechanism by which to extend the data model.

   At least one of the aggregate classes MUST be present in an instance
   of the Contact class.  This is not enforced in the IODEF schema as
   there is no simple way to accomplish it.

   The Contact class has five attributes:

      Zero or One.  In a history log created by multiple parties, the
      IncidentID provides a mechanism to specify which CSIRT created a
      particular entry and references this organization's incident
      tracking number.  When a single organization is maintaining the
      log, this class can be ignored.

   Contact
      Zero or One.  Provides contact information for the person that
      performed the action documented in this class.

   Description
      Zero or many.  ML_STRING.  A free-form textual description of the
      action or event.

   DefinedCOA
      Zero or many.  ML_STRING.  A unique identifier meaningful to the
      sender and recipient of this document that references a course of
      action.  This class MUST be present if the action attribute is set
      to "defined-coa".

      documented in this history log entry.  As activity will likely
      have been instigated either through a previously conveyed
      expectation or internal investigation, this attribute is identical
      to the category attribute of the Expectation class.  The
      difference is only one of tense.  When an action is in this class,
      it has been completed.  See Section 3.16.

   Record
      Zero or one.  Supportive data (e.g., log files) that provides
      additional information about the event.

   EventData
      Zero or more.  EventData instances contained within another
      EventData instance inherit the values of the parent(s); this
      recursive definition can be used to group common data pertaining
      to multiple events.  When EventData elements are defined
      recursively, only the leaf instances (those EventData instances
      not containing other EventData instances) represent actual events.

   AdditionalData
      Zero or more.  An extension mechanism for data not explicitly
      represented in the data model.

   At least one of the aggregate classes MUST be present in an instance
   of the EventData class.  This is not enforced in the IODEF schema as
   there is no simple way to accomplish it.

3.15.1.  Relating the Incident and EventData Classes

   There is substantial overlap in the Incident and EventData classes.
   Nevertheless, the semantics of these classes are quite different.
   The Incident class provides summary information about the entire
   incident, while the EventData class provides information about the
   individual events comprising the incident.  In the most common case,
   the EventData class will provide more specific information for the
   general description provided in the Incident class.  However, it may
   also be possible that the overall summarized information about the
   incident conflicts with some individual information in an EventData
   class when there is a substantial composition of various events in
   the incident.  In such a case, the interpretation of the more
   specific EventData MUST supersede the more generic information
   provided in Incident.

3.15.2.  Cardinality of EventData

   The EventData class can be thought of as a container for the
   properties of an event in an incident.  These properties include: the
   hosts involved, impact of the incident activity on the hosts,
   forensic logs, etc.  With an instance of the EventData class, hosts
   (i.e., System class) are grouped around these common properties.

   The recursive definition (or instance property inheritance) of the
   EventData class (the EventData class is aggregated into the EventData
   class) provides a way to relate information without requiring the
   explicit use of unique attribute identifiers in the classes or
   duplicating information.  Instead, the relative depth (nesting) of a
   class is used to group (relate) information.

   For example, an EventData class might be used to describe two
   machines involved in an incident.  This description can be achieved
   using multiple instances of the Flow class.  It happens that there is
   a common technical contact (i.e., Contact class) for these two
   machines, but the impact (i.e., Assessment class) on them is
   different.  A depiction of the representation for this situation can
   be found in Figure 26.

   the actions the sender is requesting.  The scope of the requested
   action is limited to purview of the EventData class in which this
   class is aggregated.

   +-------------------------+
   | Expectation             |
   +-------------------------+
   | ENUM restriction        |<>--{0..*}--[ Description ]
   | ENUM severity           |<>--{0..*}--[ DefinedCOA  ]
   | ENUM action             |<>--{0..1}--[ StartTime   ]
   | STRING ext-action       |<>--{0..1}--[ EndTime     ]
   | STRING indicator-uid    |<>--{0..1}--[ Contact     ]
   | STRING indicator-set-id |
   +-------------------------+

                     Figure 27: The Expectation Class

   The aggregate classes that constitute Expectation are:

   Description
      Zero or many.  ML_STRING.  A free-form description of the desired
      action(s).

   DefinedCOA
      Zero or many.  ML_STRING.  A unique identifier meaningful to the
      sender and recipient of this document that references a course of
      action.  This class MUST be present if the action attribute is set
      to "defined-coa".

   StartTime

      Zero or one.  The time at which the sender would like the action
      performed.  A timestamp that is earlier than the ReportTime
      specified in the Incident class denotes that the sender would like
      the action performed as soon as possible.  The absence of this
      element indicates no expectations of when the recipient would like
      the action performed.

   EndTime
      Zero or one.  The time by which the sender expects the recipient
      to complete the action.  If the recipient cannot complete the
      action before EndTime, the recipient MUST NOT carry out the
      action.  Because of transit delays, clock drift, and so on, the
      sender MUST be prepared for the recipient to have carried out the
      action, even if it completes past EndTime.

   Contact
      Zero or one.  The expected actor for the action.

   The Expectations class has six attributes:

   restriction
      Optional.  ENUM.  This attribute is defined in Section 3.2.  The
      default value is "default".

   severity
      Optional.  ENUM.  Indicates the desired priority of the action.
      This attribute is an enumerated list with no default value, and
      the semantics of these relative measures are context dependent.

      1.  low.  Low priority

      2.  medium.  Medium priority

      3.  high.  High priority

   action
      Optional.  ENUM.  Classifies the type of action requested.  This
      attribute is an enumerated list with a default value of "other".

      1.   nothing.  No action is requested.  Do nothing with the
           information.

      2.   contact-source-site.  Contact the site(s) identified as the
           source of the activity.

      3.   contact-target-site.  Contact the site(s) identified as the
           target of the activity.

3.17.  Flow Class

   The Flow class groups related the source and target hosts.

   +------------------+
   | Flow             |
   +------------------+
   |                  |<>--{1..*}--[ System   ]
   +------------------+

                         Figure 28: The Flow Class

   The aggregate class that constitutes Flow is:

   System
      One or More.  A host or network involved in an event.

   The Flow class has no attributes.

3.18.  System Class

   The System class describes a system or network involved in an event.
   The systems or networks represented by this class are categorized
   according to the role they played in the incident through the
   category attribute.  The value of this category attribute dictates
   the semantics of the aggregated classes in the System class.  If the
   category attribute has a value of "source", then the aggregated
   classes denote the machine and service from which the activity is
   originating.  With a category attribute value of "target" or
   "intermediary", then the machine or service is the one targeted in
   the activity.  A value of "sensor" dictates that this System was part
   of an instrumentation to monitor the network.

3.21.  Service Class

   The Service class describes a network service of a host or network.
   The service is identified by specific port or list of ports, along
   with the application listening on that port.

   When Service occurs as an aggregate class of a System that is a
   source, then this service is the one from which activity of interest
   is originating.  Conversely, when Service occurs as an aggregate
   class of a System that is a target, then that service is the one to
   which activity of interest is directed.

   This class was derived from [RFC4765].

   Either a Port or Portlist class MUST be specified for a given
   instance of a Service class.

   When a given System classes with category="source" and another with
   category="target" are aggregated into a single Flow class, and each
   of these System classes has a Service and Portlist class, an implicit
   relationship between these Portlists exists.  If N ports are listed
   for a System@category="source", and M ports are listed for
   System@category="target", the number of ports in N must be equal to
   M.  Likewise, the ports MUST be listed in an identical sequence such
   that the n-th port in the source corresponds to the n-th port of the
   target.  If N is greater than 1, a given instance of a Flow class
   MUST only have a single instance of a System@category="source" and
   System@category="target".

4.  Processing Considerations

   This section defines additional requirements on creating and parsing
   IODEF documents.

4.1.  Encoding

   Every IODEF document MUST begin with an XML declaration, and MUST
   specify the XML version used.  If UTF-8 encoding is not used, the
   character encoding MUST also be explicitly specified.  The IODEF
   conforms to all XML data encoding conventions and constraints.



Danyliw & Stoecker        Expires July 5, 2014                 [Page 75]

Internet-Draft                    IODEF                     January 2014


   The XML declaration with no character encoding will read as follows:

   <?xml version="1.0" ?>

   When a character encoding is specified, the XML declaration will read
   like the following:

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="charset" ?>

   Where "charset" is the name of the character encoding as registered
   with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), see [RFC2978].

   The following characters have special meaning in XML and MUST be
   escaped with their entity reference equivalent: "&", "<", ">", "\""
   (double quotation mark), and "'" (apostrophe).  These entity
   references are "&amp;", "&lt;", "&gt;", "&quot;", and "&apos;"
   respectively.

4.2.  IODEF Namespace

   The IODEF schema declares a namespace of
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:iodef-2.0" and registers it per [W3C.XMLNS].
   Each IODEF document MUST include a valid reference to the IODEF
   schema using the "xsi:schemaLocation" attribute.  An example of such
   a declaration would look as follows:

   <IODEF-Document
      version="2.00" lang="en-US"
      xmlns:iodef="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:iodef-2.0"
      xsi:schemaLocation="urn:ietf:params:xmls:schema:iodef-2.0"

4.3.  Validation

   The IODEF documents MUST be well-formed XML.  It is RECOMMENDED that
   recipients validate the document against the schema described in
   Section 8.  However, mere conformance to the schema is not sufficient
   for a semantically valid IODEF document.  There is additional
   specification in the text of Section 3 that cannot be readily encoded
   in the schema and it must also be considered by an IODEF parser.  The
   following is a list of discrepancies in what is more strictly
   specified in the normative text (Section 3), but not enforced in the
   IODEF schema:

   o  The elements or attributes that are defined as POSTAL, NAME,
      PHONE, and EMAIL data-types are implemented as "xs:string", but
      more rigid formatting requirements are specified in the text.

Internet-Draft                    IODEF                     January 2014


   o  The IODEF-Document@lang and MLStringType@lang attributes are
      declared as an "xs:language" that constrains values with a regular
      expression.  However, the value of this attribute still needs to
      be validated against the list of possible enumerated values is
      defined in [RFC4646].

   o  The MonetaryImpact@currency attribute is declared as an
      "xs:string", but the list of valid values as defined in [ISO4217].

   o  All of the aggregated classes Contact and EventData are optional
      in the schema, but at least one of these aggregated classes MUST
      be present.

   o  There are multiple conventions that can be used to categorize a
      system using the NodeRole class or to specify software with the
      Application and OperatingSystem classes.  IODEF parsers MUST
      accept incident reports that do not use these fields in accordance
      with local conventions.

   o  The Confidence@rating attribute determines whether the element
      content of Confidence should be empty.

   o  The Address@type attribute determines the format of the element
      content.

   o  The attributes AdditionalData@dtype and RecordItem@dtype derived
      from iodef:ExtensionType determine the semantics and formatting of
      the element content.

   o  Symmetry in the enumerated ports of a Portlist class is required
      between sources and targets.  See Section 3.21.

5.  Extending the IODEF

   In order to support the changing activity of CSIRTS, the IODEF data
   model will need to evolve along with them.  This section discusses
   how new data elements that have no current representation in the data
   model can be incorporated into the IODEF.  These techniques are
   designed so that adding new data will not require a change to the
   IODEF schema.  With proven value, well documented extensions can be
   incorporated into future versions of the specification.  However,
   this approach also supports private extensions relevant only to a
   closed consortium.

Internet-Draft                    IODEF                     January 2014


5.1.  Extending the Enumerated Values of Attributes

   The data model supports a means by which to add new enumerated values
   to an attribute.  For each attribute that supports this extension
   technique, there is a corresponding attribute in the same element
   whose name is identical, less a prefix of "ext-".  This special
   attribute is referred to as the extension attribute, and the
   attribute being extended is referred to as an extensible attribute.
   For example, an extensible attribute named "foo" will have a
   corresponding extension attribute named "ext-foo".  An element may
   have many extensible, and therefore many extension, attributes.

   In addition to a corresponding extension attribute, each extensible
   attribute has "ext-value" as one its possible values.  This
   particular value serves as an escape sequence and has no valid
   meaning.

   In order to add a new enumerated value to an extensible attribute,
   the value of this attribute MUST be set to "ext-value", and the new
   desired value MUST be set in the corresponding extension attribute.
   For example, an extended instance of the type attribute of the Impact
   class would look as follows:

    <Impact type="ext-value" ext-type="new-attack-type">

   A given extension attribute MUST NOT be set unless the corresponding
   extensible attribute has been set to "ext-value".

5.2.  Extending Classes

   The classes of the data model can be extended only through the use of
   the AdditionalData and RecordItem classes.  These container classes,
   collectively referred to as the extensible classes, are implemented
   with the iodef:ExtensionType data type in the schema.  They provide
   the ability to have new atomic or XML-encoded data elements in all of
   the top-level classes of the Incident class and a few of the more
   complicated subordinate classes.  As there are multiple instances of
   the extensible classes in the data model, there is discretion on
   where to add a new data element.  It is RECOMMENDED that the
   extension be placed in the most closely related class to the new
   information.

   Extensions using the atomic data types (i.e., all values of the dtype
   attributes other than "xml") MUST:

   1.  Set the element content of extensible class to the desired value,
       and




Danyliw & Stoecker        Expires July 5, 2014                 [Page 78]

Internet-Draft                    IODEF                     January 2014


   2.  Set the dtype attribute to correspond to the data type of the
       element content.

   The following guidelines exist for extensions using XML:

   1.  The element content of the extensible class MUST be set to the
       desired value and the dtype attribute MUST be set to "xml".

   2.  The extension schema MUST declare a separate namespace.  It is
       RECOMMENDED that these extensions have the prefix "iodef-".  This
       recommendation makes readability of the document easier by
       allowing the reader to infer which namespaces relate to IODEF by
       inspection.

   3.  It is RECOMMENDED that extension schemas follow the naming
       convention of the IODEF data model.  This makes reading an
       extended IODEF document look like any other IODEF document.  The
       names of all elements are capitalized.  For elements with
       composed names, a capital letter is used for each word.
       Attribute names are lower case.  Attributes with composed names
       are separated by a hyphen.

   4.  Parsers that encounter an unrecognized element in a namespace
       that they do support MUST reject the document as a syntax error.

   5.  There are security and performance implications in requiring
       implementations to dynamically download schemas at run time.
       Thus, implementations SHOULD NOT download schemas at runtime,
       unless implementations take appropriate precautions and are
       prepared for potentially significant network, processing, and
       time-out demands.

   6.  Some users of the IODEF may have private schema definitions that
       might not be available on the Internet.  In this situation, if a
       IODEF document leaks out of the private use space, references to
       some of those document schemas may not be resolvable.  This has
       two implications.  First, references to private schemas may never
       resolve.  As such, in addition to the suggestion that
       implementations do not download schemas at runtime mentioned
       above, recipients MUST be prepared for a schema definition in an
       IODEF document never to resolve.

   The following schema and XML document excerpt provide a template for
   an extension schema and its use in the IODEF document.

   This example schema defines a namespace of "iodef-extension1" and a
   single element named "newdata".

6.  Internationalization Issues

   Internationalization and localization is of specific concern to the
   IODEF, since it is only through collaboration, often across language
   barriers, that certain incidents be resolved.  The IODEF supports
   this goal by depending on XML constructs, and through explicit design
   choices in the data model.

   Since IODEF is implemented as an XML Schema, it implicitly supports
   all the different character encodings, such as UTF-8 and UTF-16,
   possible with XML.  Additionally, each IODEF document MUST specify
   the language in which their contents are encoded.  The language can
   be specified with the attribute "xml:lang" (per Section 2.12 of
   [W3C.XML]) in the top-level element (i.e., IODEF-Document@lang) and
   letting all other elements inherit that definition.  All IODEF
   classes with a free-form text definition (i.e., all those defined of

   type iodef:MLStringType) can also specify a language different from
   the rest of the document.  The valid language codes for the
   "xml:lang" attribute are described in [RFC4646].

   The data model supports multiple translations of free-form text.  In
   the places where free-text is used for descriptive purposes, the
   given class always has a one-to-many cardinality to its parent (e.g.,
   Description class).  The intent is to allow the identical text to be
   encoded in different instances of the same class, but each being in a
   different language.  This approach allows an IODEF document author to
   send recipients speaking different languages an identical document.
   The IODEF parser SHOULD extract the appropriate language relevant to
   the recipient.

   While the intent of the data model is to provide internationalization
   and localization, the intent is not to do so at the detriment of
   interoperability.  While the IODEF does support different languages,
   the data model also relies heavily on standardized enumerated
   attributes that can crudely approximate the contents of the document.
   With this approach, a CSIRT should be able to make some sense of an
   IODEF document it receives even if the text based data elements are
   written in a language unfamiliar to the analyst.

   This section provides examples of an incident encoded in the IODEF.
   These examples do not necessarily represent the only way to encode a
   particular incident.

    CHANGE - new indicator values in the schema

    The purpose of the proposed changes is to include commonly shared
    indicators in the base IODEF schema.  This class will contain
    indicators from the list below that are not represented elsewhere
    in the schema.  IODEF extensions or embedded schemas via the SCI
    classes will be required to include additional data types.
    A table could be maintained through IANA to extend or change this
    class in between IODEF revisions.

   RFC5901 provides a method to include an entire email, the following
   included indicators are ones commonly used when you do not need the
   entire email
 The following are in the Service Class:

9.  Security Considerations

   The IODEF data model itself does not directly introduce security
   issues.  Rather, it simply defines a representation for incident
   information.  As the data encoded by the IODEF might be considered
   privacy sensitive by the parties exchanging the information or by
   those described by it, care needs to be taken in ensuring the
   appropriate disclosure during both document exchange and subsequent
   processing.  The former must be handled by a messaging format, but
   the latter risk must be addressed by the systems that process, store,
   and archive IODEF documents and information derived from them.

   Executable content could be embedded into the IODEF document directly
   or through an extension.  The IODEF parser should handle this content
   with care to prevent unintentional automated execution.

   The contents of an IODEF document may include a request for action or
   an IODEF parser may independently have logic to take certain actions
   based on information that it finds.  For this reason, care must be
   taken by the parser to properly authenticate the recipient of the

   document and ascribe an appropriate confidence to the data prior to
   action.

   The underlying messaging format and protocol used to exchange
   instances of the IODEF MUST provide appropriate guarantees of
   confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.  The use of a
   standardized security protocol is encouraged.  The Real-time Inter-
   network Defense (RID) protocol [RFC6545] and its associated transport
   binding IODEF/RID over HTTP/TLS [RFC6546] provide such security.

   In order to suggest data processing and handling guidelines of the
   encoded information, the IODEF allows a document sender to convey a
   privacy policy using the restriction attribute.  The various
   instances of this attribute allow different data elements of the
   document to be covered by dissimilar policies.  While flexible, it
   must be stressed that this approach only serves as a guideline from
   the sender, as the recipient is free to ignore it.  The issue of
   enforcement is not a technical problem.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document uses URNs to describe an XML namespace and schema
   conforming to a registry mechanism described in [RFC3688]

   Registration for the IODEF namespace:

   o  URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:iodef-2.0

   o  Registrant Contact: See the first author of the "Author's Address"
      section of this document.

   o  XML: None.  Namespace URIs do not represent an XML specification.

   Registration for the IODEF XML schema:

   o  URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:iodef-2.0

   o  Registrant Contact: See the first author of the "Author's Address"
      section of this document.

   o  XML: See the "IODEF Schema" in Section 8 of this document.
