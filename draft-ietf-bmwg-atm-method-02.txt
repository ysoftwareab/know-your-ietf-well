Abstract

   This document discusses and defines a number of tests that may  be  used
   to  describe  the  performance  characteristics  of  ATM based switching
   devices.  In addition to defining the tests this document also describes
   specific formats for reporting the results of the tests.

   Appendix  A  lists  the  tests  and conditions that we believe should be
   included for specific  cases  and  gives  additional  information  about
   testing practices.

INTERNET-DRAFT        Methodology for ATM Benchmarking            July 2000


   This  memo  is  a  product of the Benchmarking Methodology Working Group
   (BMWG) of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

1. Introduction.

   This document defines a specific set of tests that vendors  can  use  to
   measure  and  report  the  performance  characteristics  of  ATM network
   devices.  The results of these tests will provide  the  user  comparable
   data  from  different vendors with which to evaluate these devices.  The
   methods defined in  this  memo  are  based  on  RFC  2544  "Benchmarking
   Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices".

   The document "Terminology for ATM Benchmarking" (RFC 2761), defines many
   of the terms that are used in this document.  The  terminology  document
   should be consulted before attempting to make use of this document.

   The   BMWG   produces  two  major  classes  of  documents:  Benchmarking
   Terminology  documents  and  Benchmarking  Methodology  documents.   The
   Terminology  documents  present  the benchmarks and other related terms.
   The Methodology documents define the procedures required to collect  the
   benchmarks cited in the corresponding Terminology documents.

2. Background

2.1. Test Device Requirements

   This  document  is  based  on  the  requirement  that  a  test device is
   available.  The test device can either be off the shelf or can be easily
   built   with   current  technologies.   The  test  device  must  have  a
   transmitting and receiving port for the interface type under test.   The
   test  device  must  be  configured  to transmit test PDUs and to analyze
   received PDUs.  The test device should be able to transmit  and  analyze
   received data at the same time.

2.2. Systems Under Test (SUTs)

   There are a number of tests described in this document that do not apply
   to each SUT. Vendors should  perform  all  of  the  tests  that  can  be
   supported by a specific product type.  It will take some time to perform
   all of the recommended tests under all of  the  recommended  conditions.
   Appendix A lists some of the tests and conditions that we believe should
   be included for specific cases.

INTERNET-DRAFT        Methodology for ATM Benchmarking            July 2000


2.3. Test Result Evaluation

   Performing all of the tests in this document will result in a great deal
   of  data.  The  applicability  of  this  data  to  the  evaluation  of a
   particular SUT will depend on its expected use and the configuration  of
   the network in which it will be used.  For example, the time required by
   a switch to provide ILMI services will not be a pertinent measurement in
   a  network  that  does  not  use  the ILMI protocol, such as an ATM WAN.
   Evaluating data  relevant  to  a  particular  network  installation  may
   require  considerable  experience,  which  may not be readily available.
   Finally, test selection and evaluation of test results must be done with
   an  understanding  of  generally  accepted  testing  practices regarding
   repeatability, variance and the  statistical  significance  of  a  small
   numbers of trials.

2.4. Requirements

   In  this document, the words that are used to define the significance of
   each particular requirement are capitalized. These words are:

   * "MUST" This word, or the words "REQUIRED" and "SHALL"  mean  that  the
   item is an absolute requirement of the specification.

   * "SHOULD" This word or the adjective "RECOMMENDED" means that there may
   exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore this item, but
   the  full  implications  should  be  understood  and  the case carefully
   weighed before choosing a different course.

   * "MAY" This word or the adjective "OPTIONAL" means that  this  item  is
   truly  optional.   One  vendor  may choose to include the item because a
   particular marketplace requires it or because it enhances  the  product,
   for example; another vendor may omit the same item.

   An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one or more of
   the  MUST  requirements   for   the   protocols   it   implements.    An
   implementation   that   satisfies  all  the  MUST  and  all  the  SHOULD
   requirements  for  its  protocols  is  said   to   be   "unconditionally
   compliant"; one that satisfies all the MUST requirements but not all the
   SHOULD requirements for its  protocols  is  said  to  be  "conditionally
   compliant".

2.5. Test Configurations for SONET

   The   test  device  can  be  connected  to  the  SUT  in  a  variety  of
   configurations   depending   on   the   test   point.    The   following
   configurations will be used for the tests described in this document.

   1)  Uni-directional  connection: The test devices transmit port (labeled
   Tx) is connected to  the  SUT  receive  port  (labeled  Rx).   The  SUTs
   transmit  port  is connected to the test device receive port (see Figure
   1).  In  this  configuration,  the  test  device  can  verify  that  all
   transmitted   packets   are  acknowledged  correctly.   Note  that  this
   configuration does not verify internal system  functions,  but  verifies
   one port on the SUT.




      +-------------+               +-------------+
      |           Tx|-------------->|Rx           |
      |    Test   Rx|<--------------|Tx   SUT     |
      |   Device    |               |             |
      +-------------+               +-------------+

                      Figure 1


   2) Bi-directional connection: The test devices first transmit port is
   connected to the SUTs first receive port.  The SUTs first transmit port
   is connected to the test devices first receive port.  The test devices
   second transmit port is connected to the SUTs second receive port.  The
   SUTs second transmit port is connected to the test devices second
   receive port (see Figure 2). In this configuration, the test device can
   determine if all of the transmitted packets were received and forwarded
   correctly.  Note that this configuration does verify internal system
   functions, since it verifies two ports on the SUT.

      +-------------+               +-------------+
      |     Test  Tx|-------------->|Rx           |
      |    Device Rx|<--------------|Tx   SUT     |
      |    Tx   Rx  |               |   Tx   Rx   |
      +-------------+               +-------------+
            |   ^                        |    ^

   2) Uni-directional passthrough connection: The test devices first
   transmit port is connected to the SUT1 receive port.  The SUT1 transmit
   port is connected to the test devices first receive port. The test
   devices second transmit port is connected to the SUT2 receive port.  The
   SUT2 transmit port is connected to the test devices second receive port
   (see Figure 3). In this configuration, the test device can determine if
   all of the packets transmitted by SUT1 were correctly acknowledged by
   SUT2.  Note that this configuration does not verify internal system
   functions, but verifies one port on each SUT.

   +-------------+           +-------------+           +-------------+

                              Figure 3

2.5. SUT Configuration

   The  SUT  MUST  be  configured  as  described  in  the  SUT users guide.
   Specifically, it is expected that all of the supported protocols will be
   configured and enabled (See Appendix A).  It is expected that all of the
   tests will be run without changing the configuration or setup of the SUT
   in  any  way  other  than  that  required  to do the specific test.  For
   example, it is not acceptable to disable all but one transport  protocol
   when  testing the throughput of that protocol.  If PNNI or BISUP is used
   to initiate switched virtual connections (SVCs), the  SUT  configuration
   SHOULD  include  the  normally  recommended routing update intervals and
   keep alive frequency.  The specific version  of  the  software  and  the
   exact  SUT configuration, including what functions are disabled and used
   during the tests MUST be included as part of the report of the  results.

2.6. Frame formats

   The  formats of the test IP PDUs to use for TCP/IP over ATM are shown in
   Appendix C: Test  Frame  Formats.   Note  that  these  IP  PDUs  are  in



Dunn & Martin                                                      [Page 5]





INTERNET-DRAFT        Methodology for ATM Benchmarking            July 2000


   accordance  with RFC 2225.  These exact IP PDU formats SHOULD be used in
   the  tests  described  in  this   document   for   this   protocol/media
   combination.  These IP PDUs will be used as a template for testing other
   protocol/media combinations.  The specific  formats  that  are  used  to
   define the test IP PDUs for a particular test series MUST be included in
   the report of the results.

2.7. Frame sizes

   All of the described tests SHOULD be performed using a number of IP  PDU
   sizes.  Specifically,  the  sizes SHOULD include the maximum and minimum
   legitimate sizes for the protocol under test on the media under test and
   enough sizes in between to be able to get a full characterization of the
   SUT performance.  Except where noted, at least five IP PDU sizes  SHOULD
   be tested for each test condition.

   Theoretically  the minimum size UDP Echo request IP PDU would consist of
   an IP header (minimum length 20 octets), a UDP header (8  octets),  AAL5
   trailer  (8  octets)  and  an  LLC/SNAP  code  point  header(8  octets);
   therefore, the minimum size  PDU  will  fit  into  one  ATM  cell.   The
   theoretical  maximum IP PDU size is determined by the size of the length
   field in the IP header.  In almost all  cases  the  actual  maximum  and
   minimum  sizes  are  determined by the limitations of the media.  In the
   case of ATM, the maximum IP PDU size SHOULD be the ATM MTU  size,  which
   is 9180 octets.

   In theory it would be ideal to distribute the IP PDU sizes in a way that
   would  evenly  distribute  the  theoretical   IP   PDU   rates.    These
   recommendations  incorporate this theory but specify IP PDU sizes, which
   are easy to understand and remember.  In addition, many of the  same  IP
   PDU  sizes  are  specified  on each of the media types to allow for easy
   performance comparisons.

   Note: The inclusion of an unrealistically small IP PDU size on  some  of
   the  media  types  (i.e.  with  little  or no space for data) is to help
   characterize the per-IP PDU processing overhead of the SUT.

   The IP PDU sizes that will be used are:

   44, 64, 128, 256, 1024, 1518, 2048, 4472, 9180

   The minimum size IP PDU for UDP on ATM is 44 octets, the minimum size of



Dunn & Martin                                                      [Page 6]





INTERNET-DRAFT        Methodology for ATM Benchmarking            July 2000


   44  is recommended to allow direct comparison to token ring performance.
   The IP PDU size of 4472 is recommended instead of the  theoretical  FDDI
   maximum  size  of  4500  octets  in  order  to  permit  the same type of
   comparison. An IP (i.e. not UDP) IP PDU may be used  in  addition  if  a
   higher data rate is desired, in which case the minimum IP PDU size is 28
   octets.

2.8. Verifying received IP PDUs

   The test equipment SHOULD discard any IP PDUs received during a test run
   that are not actual forwarded test IP PDUs.  For example, keep-alive and
   routing update IP PDUs SHOULD NOT be included in the count  of  received
   IP  PDUs.   In  any case, the test equipment SHOULD verify the length of
   the received IP PDUs and check that they match the expected length.

   Preferably, the test equipment SHOULD include sequence  numbers  in  the
   transmitted IP PDUs and check for these numbers on the received IP PDUs.
   If this is done, the reported results SHOULD include. in addition to the
   number  of IP PDUs dropped, the number of IP PDUs that were received out
   of order, the number of duplicate IP PDUs received  and  the  number  of
   gaps  in  the received IP PDU numbering sequence.  This functionality is
   required for some of the described tests.

2.9. Modifiers

   It is useful to characterize the SUTs  performance  under  a  number  of
   conditions.  Some  of  these  conditions  are noted below.  The reported
   results SHOULD include as many of these conditions as the test equipment
   is able to generate.  The suite of tests SHOULD be run first without any
   modifying  conditions,  then  repeated  under  each  of  the   modifying
   conditions  separately.   To preserve the ability to compare the results
   of these tests, any IP PDUs that are required to generate the  modifying
   conditions  (excluding  management queries) will be included in the same
   data stream as that of the normal test IP PDUs and in place  of  one  of
   the  test  IP  PDUs.  They MUST not be supplied to the SUT on a separate
   network port.

2.9.1. Management IP PDUs

   Most ATM data networks now make use of ILMI, signaling and OAM. In  many
   environments,  there  can  be  a  number  of management stations sending
   queries to the same SUT at the same time.



Dunn & Martin                                                      [Page 7]





INTERNET-DRAFT        Methodology for ATM Benchmarking            July 2000


   Management queries MUST  be  made  in  accordance  with  the  applicable
   specification,  e.g.,  ILMI  sysUpTime  getNext requests will be made in
   accordance with ILMI 4.0. The response to the query MUST be verified  by
   the test equipment. Note that, for each management protocol in use, this
   requires that the test equipment implement the associated protocol state
   machine.   One  example of the specific query IP PDU that should be used
   is shown in Appendix B.

2.9.2. Routing update IP PDUs

   The processing of PNNI updates could have a significant  impact  on  the
   ability  of  a  switch  to forward cells and complete calls.  If PNNI is
   configured on the SUT, one routing update MUST be transmitted before the
   first  test  IP  PDU  is  transmitted during the trial.  The test SHOULD
   verify that the SUT has properly processed the routing update.

   PNNI routing update IP PDUs SHOULD be sent  at  the  rate  specified  in
   Appendix  B.  Appendix  C defines two routing update PDUs for the TCP/IP
   over ATM example.  The  routing  updates  are  designed  to  change  the
   routing  on a number of networks that are not involved in the forwarding
   of the test data.  The first IP PDU sets the routing table state to "A",
   the second one changes the state to "B".  The IP PDUs MUST be alternated
   during the trial. The test SHOULD  verify  that  the  SUT  has  properly
   processed the routing update.

2.10. Filters

   Filters  are  added to switches to selectively inhibit the forwarding of
   cells that would  normally  be  forwarded.   This  is  usually  done  to
   implement  security  controls  on  the data that is accepted between one
   area and another. Different  products  have  different  capabilities  to
   implement  filters.  Filters are applicable only if the SUT supports the
   filtering feature.

   The SUT SHOULD be first configured to add one filter condition  and  the
   tests  performed.   This filter SHOULD permit the forwarding of the test
   data stream. This filter SHOULD be of the form as described in  the  SUT
   Users Guide.

   The  SUT SHOULD be then reconfigured to implement a total of 25 filters.
   The first 24 of these filters SHOULD be based on 24  separate  ATM  NSAP
   Network Prefix addresses.



Dunn & Martin                                                      [Page 8]





INTERNET-DRAFT        Methodology for ATM Benchmarking            July 2000


   The  24  ATM  NSAP  Network  Prefix addresses SHOULD not be any that are
   represented in the test data stream.  The last filter SHOULD permit  the
   forwarding  of  the  test data stream.  By "first" and "last" we mean to
   ensure that in the second case, 25 conditions must be checked before the
   data  IP  over  ATM  PDUs  will  match  the  conditions  that permit the
   forwarding of the IP PDU. Of course, if the SUT reorders the filters  or
   does  not  use  a  linear  scan  of  the  filter rules the effect of the
   sequence in which the filters are input is properly lost.

   The exact filters configuration command lines used  SHOULD  be  included
   with the report of the results.

2.10.1. Filter Addresses

   Two  sets  of  filter  addresses are required, one for the single filter
   case and one for the 25 filter case.

   The single filter case should permit traffic from  ATM  address  [Switch
   Network  Prefix]  00  00  00  00 00 01 00 to ATM address [Switch Network
   Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 02 00 and deny all other traffic.  Note that  the
   13  octet  Switch Network Prefix MUST be configured before this test can
   be run.

   The 25 filter case should follow the following sequence.

        deny [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 01 00
             to [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 03 00
        deny [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 01 00
             to [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 04 00
        deny [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 01 00
             to [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 05 00
        ...
        deny [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 01 00
             to [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 0C 00
        deny [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 01 00
             to [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 0D 00
        allow [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 01 00
             to [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 02 00
        deny [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 01 00
             to [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 0E 00
        deny [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 01 00
             to [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 0F 00



Dunn & Martin                                                      [Page 9]





INTERNET-DRAFT        Methodology for ATM Benchmarking            July 2000


         ...
        deny [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 01 00
             to [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 18 00
        deny all else

   All previous filter conditions should be cleared from the switch  before
   this  sequence  is  entered.  The sequence is selected to test to see if
   the switch sorts the filter conditions or accepts them in the order that
   they  were  entered.   Both of these procedures will result in a greater
   impact on performance than will some form of hash coding.

2.11. Protocol addresses

   It is easier to implement these tests using a single logical  stream  of
   data,  with  one source ATM address and one destination ATM address, and
   for some conditions  like  the  filters  described  above,  a  practical
   requirement.   Networks  in  the  real  world  are not limited to single
   streams of data. The test suite SHOULD be first run with  a  single  ATM
   source  and destination address pair.  The tests SHOULD then be repeated
   with using a random destination address.  In the case of testing  single
   switches,  the addresses SHOULD be random and uniformly distributed over
   a range of 256 seven octet user parts.  In the case of testing  multiple
   interconnected  switches,  the  addresses SHOULD be random and uniformly
   distributed over the 256 network prefixes, each of which should  support
   256  seven octet user parts.  The specific address ranges to use for ATM
   are shown in Appendix B.  IP to ATM address mapping MUST be accomplished
   as described in RFC 2225.

2.12. Route Set Up

   It  is  not  reasonable that all of the routing information necessary to
   forward the test stream, especially in the multiple address  case,  will
   be  manually  set  up.  If PNNI and/or ILMI are running, at the start of
   each trial a routing update MUST be sent to the SUT. This routing update
   MUST  include  all  of  the  ATM addresses that will be required for the
   trial. This routing update will have to  be  repeated  at  the  interval
   required  by  PNNI  or  ILMI.   An  example of the format and repetition
   interval of the update IP PDUs is given in Appendix B.

2.13. Bidirectional traffic

   Bidirectional performance tests SHOULD be run with the  same  data  rate



Dunn & Martin                                                     [Page 10]





INTERNET-DRAFT        Methodology for ATM Benchmarking            July 2000


   being  offered from each direction. The sum of the data rates should not
   exceed the theoretical limit for the media.

2.14. Single stream path

   The full suite of tests SHOULD be run with the appropriate modifiers for
   a single receive and transmit port on the SUT. If the internal design of
   the SUT has multiple distinct pathways, for example, multiple  interface
   cards  each  with multiple network ports, then all possible permutations
   of pathways SHOULD be tested  separately.   If  multiple  interconnected
   switches  are tested, the test MUST specify routes, which allow only one
   path between source and destination ATM addresses.

2.15. Multi-port

   Many switch products provide several network ports on the same interface
   module.  Each  port  on  an  interface module SHOULD be stimulated in an
   identical manner.  Specifically, half of the ports on each module SHOULD
   be  receive  ports  and half SHOULD be transmit ports.  For example if a
   SUT has two interface module each of which has four ports, two ports  on
   each  interface  module be receive ports and two will be transmit ports.
   Each receive port MUST be offered the same data rate.  The addresses  in
   the  input data streams SHOULD be set so that an IP PDU will be directed
   to each of the transmit ports in sequence.  That is, all transmit  ports
   will  receive  an  identical  distribution  of IP PDUs from a particular
   receive port.


   Consider the following 6 port SUT:

             --------------
    ---------| Rx A   Tx X|--------
    ---------| Rx B   Tx Y|--------
    ---------| Rx C   Tx Z|--------
             --------------

   The addressing of the data streams for each of the inputs SHOULD be:

     stream sent to Rx A:
       IP PDU to Tx X, IP PDU to Tx Y, IP PDU to Tx Z
     stream sent to Rx B:
       IP PDU to Tx X, IP PDU to Tx Y, IP PDU to Tx Z



Dunn & Martin                                                     [Page 11]





INTERNET-DRAFT        Methodology for ATM Benchmarking            July 2000


     stream sent to Rx C
       IP PDU to Tx X, IP PDU to Tx Y, IP PDU to Tx Z

   Note:  Each  stream  contains  the  same  sequence  of  IP   destination
   addresses;  therefore,  each  transmit  port  will  receive  3  IP  PDUs
   simultaneously. This procedure ensures that the SUT will have to process
   multiple IP PDUs addressed to the same transmit port simultaneously.

   The  same  configuration  MAY be used to perform a bi-directional multi-
   stream test.  In this case all of the ports are considered both  receive
   and  transmit  ports.   Each  data  stream MUST consist of IP PDUs whose
   addresses correspond to the ATM addresses all of the other ports.

2.16. Multiple protocols

   This document does not address the issue of testing  the  effects  of  a
   mixed  protocol environment other than to suggest that if such tests are
   wanted  then  PDUs  SHOULD  be  distributed  between  all  of  the  test
   protocols.   The  distribution  MAY  approximate  the  conditions on the
   network in which the SUT would be used.

2.17. Multiple IP PDU sizes

   This document does not address the issue of testing  the  effects  of  a
   mixed  IP PDU size environment other than to suggest that, if such tests
   are required, then IP PDU size SHOULD be evenly distributed among all of
   the PDU sizes listed in this document.  The distribution MAY approximate
   the conditions on the network in which the SUT would be used.

2.18. Testing beyond a single SUT

   In the performance  testing  of  a  single  SUT,  the  paradigm  can  be
   described as applying some input to a SUT and monitoring the output. The
   results of which can be used to form a basis of characterization of that
   device under those test conditions.

   This  model  is  useful  when  the  test input and output are homogenous
   (e.g., 64-byte IP, AAL5 PDUs into the SUT; 64 byte IP, AAL5 PDUs out).

   By extending the single SUT test model, reasonable benchmarks  regarding
   multiple  SUTs  or  heterogeneous environments may be collected. In this
   extension, the single SUT is replaced  by  a  system  of  interconnected



Dunn & Martin                                                     [Page 12]





INTERNET-DRAFT        Methodology for ATM Benchmarking            July 2000


   network  SUTs. This test methodology would support the benchmarking of a
   variety of device/media/service/protocol combinations.  For  example,  a
   configuration for a LAN-to-WAN-to-LAN test might be:

       (1) ATM UNI -> SUT 1 -> BISUP -> SUT 2 -> ATM UNI

   Or an extended LAN configuration might be:

       (2) ATM UNI -> SUT 1 -> PNNI Network -> SUT 2 -> ATM UNI

   In  both examples 1 and 2, end-to-end benchmarks of each system could be
   empirically ascertained. Other behavior may be characterized through the
   use of intermediate devices. In example 2, the configuration may be used
   to give an indication of the effect of PNNI routing on IP throughput.

   Because multiple  SUTs  are  treated  as  a  single  system,  there  are
   limitations  to  this  methodology.  For  instance, this methodology may
   yield an aggregate benchmark for a tested system. That benchmark  alone,
   however, may not necessarily reflect asymmetries in behavior between the
   SUTs,  latencies  introduced  by  other  apparatus   (e.g.,   CSUs/DSUs,
   switches), etc.

   Further,  care  must  be  used  when  comparing  benchmarks of different
   systems by ensuring that the SUTs' features  and  configuration  of  the
   tested  systems  have  the  appropriate  common  denominators  to  allow
   comparison.

2.19. Maximum IP PDU rate

   The  maximum  IP  PDU  rates  that  should  be  used  when  testing  LAN
   connections SHOULD be the listed theoretical maximum rate for the IP PDU
   size on the media.

   The maximum IP PDU rate that should be used when testing WAN connections
   SHOULD  be  greater  than the listed theoretical maximum rate for the IP
   PDU size on that speed connection.  The higher rate for WAN tests is  to
   compensate for the fact that some vendors employ various forms of header
   compression.

   A list of maximum IP PDU  rates  for  LAN  connections  is  included  in
   Appendix B.

INTERNET-DRAFT        Methodology for ATM Benchmarking            July 2000


2.20. Bursty traffic

   It is convenient to measure the SUT performance under steady state load;
   however, this is an unrealistic way to gauge the functioning of  a  SUT.
   Actual network traffic normally consists of bursts of IP PDUs.

   Some of the tests described below SHOULD be performed with both constant
   bit rate, bursty Unspecified Bit Rate (UBR) Best Effort  [AF-TM4.1]  and
   Variable  Bit  Rate Non-real Time (VBR-nrt) Best Effort [AF-TM4.1].  The
   IP PDUs within a burst  are  transmitted  with  the  minimum  legitimate
   inter-IP PDU gap.

   The  objective  of the test is to determine the minimum interval between
   bursts that the SUT can process with no IP PDU loss.   Tests  SHOULD  be
   run with burst sizes of 10% of Maximum Burst Size (MBS), 20% of MBS, 50%
   of MBS and 100% MBS.  Note that the number of IP PDUs in each burst will
   depend  on  the  PDU size. For UBR, the MBS refers to the associated VBR
   traffic parameters.

2.21. Trial description

   A particular test consists of multiple trials.  Each trial  returns  one
   piece of information, for example the loss rate at a particular input IP
   PDU rate.  Each trial consists of five of phases:

   a) If the SUT is a switch supporting PNNI, send the  routing  update  to
   the  SUT  receive  port and wait two seconds to be sure that the routing
   has settled.

   b) Send an ATM ARP PDU to determine the ATM address corresponding to the
   destination  IP  address.  The formats of the ATM ARP PDU that should be
   used are shown in the  Test  Frame  Formats  document  and  MUST  be  in
   accordance with RFC 2225.

   c) Stimulate SUT with traffic load.

   d) Wait for two seconds for any residual IP PDUs to be received.

   e) Wait for at least five seconds for the SUT to restabilize.

2.22. Trial duration




Dunn & Martin                                                     [Page 14]





INTERNET-DRAFT        Methodology for ATM Benchmarking            July 2000


   The  objective  of  the  tests defined in this document is to accurately
   characterize the behavior of a particular  piece  of  network  equipment
   under  varying  traffic  loads.   The  choice of test duration must be a
   compromise between this  objective  and  keeping  the  duration  of  the
   benchmarking  test  suite  within  reasonable bounds.  The SUT SHOULD be
   stimulated for at least 60 seconds.  If this time period  results  in  a
   high  variance  in the test results, the SUT SHOULD be stimulated for at
   least 300 seconds.

2.23. Address resolution

   The SUT MUST be able to respond to address resolution requests  sent  by
   another  SUT, an ATM ARP server or the test equipment in accordance with
   RFC 2225.

2.24. Synchronized Payload Bit Pattern.

   Some measurements assume that both the transmitter and receiver  payload
   information   is  synchronized.  Synchronization  MUST  be  achieved  by
   supplying a known bit pattern to  both  the  transmitter  and  receiver.
   This bit pattern MUST be one of the following: PRBS-15, PRBS-23, 0xFF00,
   or 0xAA55.

2.25. Burst Traffic Descriptors.

   Some measurements require busty traffic patterns.  These  patterns  MUST
   conform to one of the following traffic descriptors:

   1) PCR=100% allotted line rate, SCR=50% allotted line rate, and MBS=8192

   2) PCR=100% allotted line rate, SCR=50% allotted line rate, and MBS=4096

   3) PCR=90% allotted line rate, SCR=50% allotted line rate, and MBS=8192

   4) PCR=90% allotted line rate, SCR=50% allotted line rate, and MBS=4096

   5) PCR=90% allotted line rate, SCR=45% allotted line rate, and MBS=8192

   6) PCR=90% allotted line rate, SCR=45% allotted line rate, and MBS=4096

   7) PCR=80% allotted line rate, SCR=40% allotted line rate, and MBS=65536

   8) PCR=80% allotted line rate, SCR=40% allotted line rate, and MBS=32768

   The  allotted  line rate refers to the total available line rate divided
   by the number of VCCs in use.

3.2.2.1. Test Setup

   The  cell  error ratio measurements assume that both the transmitter and
   receiver payload information is synchronized.  Synchronization  MUST  be
   achieved  by  supplying  a known bit pattern to both the transmitter and
   receiver.  If this bit pattern is  longer  than  the  packet  size,  the
   receiver  MUST synchronize with the transmitter before tests can be run.

supported  on the SUT in relation to the total cells sent as defined in RFC
2761 "Terminology for ATM Benchmarking".

Procedure:

   1)  Set  up  the  SUT  and  test   device   using   the   bi-directional
   configuration.

   2) Configure the SUT and test device with three VCC's.  Each VCC MUST be
   defined as a different Bearer class; one CBR, one UBR and one VBR.  Each
   VCC  SHOULD  contain  one  VPI/VCI.   The VPI/VCI MUST not be one of the
   reserved ATM signaling channels (e.g. [0,5], [0,16]).

   3) Send a specific number of IP packets containing one of the  specified
   bit  patterns  through the SUT via the defined test VCCs. Each generated
   VCC stream MUST match the corresponding VCC Bearer class.   All  of  the
   VPI/VCI  pairs  will  generate  traffic at the same traffic rate.  Since
   this test is not a throughput test, the rate should not be greater  than
   90% of line rate.  The IP PDUs MUST be encapsulated in AAL5.

   4)  Count  the  IP  packets  that  are  transmitted by the SUT to verify
   connectivity and load.  If the count on the test device is the  same  on
   the  SUT,  continue  the  test;  else lower the test device traffic rate
   until the counts are the same.

   5) Record the number of bit errors at  the  receiver  end  of  the  test
   device for all VCCs.

   The  cell  transfer  delay measurements assume that both the transmitter
   and receiver  timestamp  information  is  synchronized.  Synchronization
   SHOULD  be  achieved  by supplying a common clock signal (minimum of 100
   Mhz or 10 ns resolution) to both  the  transmitter  and  receiver.   The

   the case of counter rollover.   The  cell  transfer  delay  measurements
   SHOULD  utilize  the  O.191 cell (ITUT-O.191) encapsulated in a valid IP
   packet.  If the O.191 cell is not available, a test cell encapsulated in
   a  valid  IP  packet MAY be used.  The test cell MUST contain a transmit
   timestamp  which  can  be  correlated  with  a  receive   timestamp.   A
   description  of the test cell MUST be included in the test results.  The

   configuration.

   2) Configure the SUT and test device with three VCC's.  Each VCC MUST be
   defined as a different Bearer class: one CBR, one UBR and one VBR.  Each
   VCC SHOULD contain one VPI/VCI.  The VPI/VCI MUST  not  be  one  of  the
   reserved ATM signaling channels (e.g. [0,5], [0,16]).

   3)  Send  a  specific number of IP packets containing timestamps through
   the SUT via the defined test VCCs. Each generated VCC stream MUST  match
   the  corresponding  VCC  Bearer  class.   All  of the VPI/VCI pairs will
   generate traffic at the same traffic rate.  Since this  test  is  not  a
   throughput  test,  the rate should not be greater than 90% of line rate.
   The IP PDUs MUST be encapsulated in AAL5.

   4) Count the IP packets that  are  transmitted  by  the  SUT  to  verify
   connectivity  and  load.  If the count on the test device is the same on
   the SUT, continue the test; else lower  the  test  device  traffic  rate
   until the counts are the same.

Reporting Format:

   The  results  of the AAL5 PDU Loss due to AAL5 PDU errors test SHOULD be
   reported in a form of a table. The rows SHOULD be labeled single  error,
   one  error  per second, and four consecutive errors every 6 IP PDUs. The

   greater than 90% of line rate.  The IP  PDUs  MUST  be  encapsulated  in
   AAL5.  The AAL5 PDU size is 65535 octets or 1365 ATM cells.

   3)  Count  the  IP  packets  that  are  transmitted by the SUT to verify
   connectivity and load.  If the count on the test device is the  same  on
   the  SUT,  continue  the  test;  else lower the test device traffic rate
   until the counts are the same.

   The AAL5 CRC error ratio measurements assume that both  the  transmitter
   and  receiver  payload information is synchronized. Synchronization MUST
   be achieved by supplying a known bit pattern to both the transmitter and

3.3.2.5. AAL5-CRC-ER/Bursty VBR Load/One VCC

Objective: To determine the SUT ratio of AAL5 CRC PDU errors on one VCC  in
a  transmission  in relation to the total AAL5 PDU's sent as defined in RFC
2761 "Terminology for ATM Benchmarking".

Procedure:

   1)  Set  up  the  SUT  and  test   device   using   the   bi-directional
   configuration.

   2)  Configure  the  SUT  and  test  device with one VCC.  The VCC SHOULD
   contain one VPI/VCI. The VCC MUST be configured as either a CBR  or  VBR
   connection.   The  VPI/VCI MUST not be one of the reserved ATM signaling
   channels  (e.g.   [0,5],  [0,16]).   The  PCR,  SCR,  and  MBS  must  be
   configured using one of the specified traffic descriptors.

   3)  Send a specific number of IP packets containing one of the specified
   bit patterns at a specific VBR rate through the SUT via the defined test
   VCC.   Since  this test is not a throughput test, the rate should not be
   greater than 90% of line rate. The IP PDUs MUST be encapsulated in AAL5.

   4)  Count  the  IP  packets  that  are  transmitted by the SUT to verify
   connectivity and load.  If the count on the test device is the  same  on
   the  SUT,  continue  the  test;  else lower the test device traffic rate
   until the counts are the same.

   5) Record the number of AAL5 CRC errors at the receiver end of the  test
   device.

Reporting Format:

   The  results  of  the AAL5-CRC-ER/Bursty VBR Load/One VCC test SHOULD be
   reported in a form of text and graph.

   The text results SHOULD display the numerical values of the AAL5-CRC-ER.
   The  values given SHOULD include: time period of test in s, test VPI/VCI
   value, total number of AAL5 PDU's transmitted and received on the  given

   bit patterns at a specific VBR rate through the SUT via the defined test
   VCCs. All of the VPI/VCI pairs will generate traffic at the same traffic
   rate.  Since this test is not a throughput test, the rate should not  be

3.3.1.10. AAL5-CRC-ER/Mixed Load/Maximum VCCs

Objective:  To  determine  the  SUT  ratio  of AAL5 CRC PDU errors with the
maximum number VCCs supported on the SUT in a transmission in  relation  to
the  total  AAL5  PDU's  sent  as  defined in RFC 2761 "Terminology for ATM
Benchmarking".

Procedure:

   1)  Set  up  the  SUT  and  test   device   using   the   bi-directional

   configuration.

   2)  Configure  the  SUT  and  test  device  with  maximum number of VCCs
   supported on the SUT.  For  example,  if  the  maximum  number  of  VCCs
   supported on the SUT is 1024, define 256 VPIs with 4 VCIs per VPI.  Each
   VCC MUST be defined as one of the Bearer classes for  a  total  of  (max
   VCC/3)  CBR, (max VCC/3) UBR and (max VCC/3) VBR VCC's. The VPI/VCI MUST
   not be one of the reserved ATM signaling channels (e.g. [0,5],  [0,16]).

   3)  Send a specific number of IP packets containing one of the specified
   bit patterns through the SUT via the defined test VCCs.  Each  generated
   VCC  stream  MUST  match the corresponding VCC Bearer class.  All of the
   VPI/VCI pairs will generate traffic at the  same  traffic  rate.   Since
   this  test is not a throughput test, the rate should not be greater than
   90% of line rate.  The IP PDUs MUST be encapsulated in AAL5.

   4) Count the IP packets that are transmitted by the SUT on all  VCCs  to
   verify  connectivity  and  load.  If the count on the test device is the
   same on the SUT, continue the test; else lower the test  device  traffic
   rate until the counts are the same.

   5)  Record the number of AAL5 CRC errors at the receiver end of the test
   device for all VCCs.

Reporting Format:

   The results of  the  AAL5-CRC-ER/Bursty  Mixed  Load/Maximum  VCCs  test
   SHOULD be reported in a form of text and graph.

   The text results SHOULD display the numerical values of the AAL5-CRC-ER.
   The values given SHOULD include: time period of test in s, test  VPI/VCI
   value,  total number of AAL5 PDU's transmitted and received on the given
   VPI/VCI during the test in positive integers, and  the  AAL5-CRC-ER  for
   the entire test.

   The  graph results SHOULD display the AAL5 CRC error ratio values. There
   will be (Max number of VCCs/10) graphs, with 10 VCCs indicated  on  each
   graph.   The x-coordinate SHOULD be the test run time in either seconds,
   minutes or days depending on the  total  length  of  the  test.  The  x-
   coordinate  time SHOULD be configurable.  The y-coordinate SHOULD be the
   AAL5-CRC-ER for each VCC. There SHOULD be no more than 10 curves on each
   graph,  one  curve  indicated  and labeled for each VCC. The integration
