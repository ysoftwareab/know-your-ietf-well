     Abstract 

        This document will capture VoIP use case for SIP Peering.  This 
        document depicts many common VoIP peering use cases. These use cases 
        are categorized into two types: static and on-demand, and then 
        further subcategorized into direct and indirect. These use cases are 
        not an exhaustive set, but rather the most common use cases deployed 
        today. This document captures them to provide a reference.

        assist in identifying requirements and future works for VoIP Peering 
        using SIP. 
         
        Only use cases related to VoIP are considered in this document.  
        Other real-time SIP communications use cases, like Instant Messaging 
        (IM) and presence are out of scope for this document.  In describing 
        use cases, the intent is descriptive, not prescriptive.   
         
        There are existing documents [2][3][4][5][6] that have captured use 
        case scenarios.  This draft draws from those documents.  The document 
        categories use cases into the following groupings; static or on-
        demand, then they are further subdivided into direct and indirect.  
        Using this categorization, the use cases contained in this document 
        attempts to be as comprehensive as possible, but should not be 
        considered the exclusive set of use cases. 
         
     2. Terminology 

        In this document, we use ?O? to indicate ?Originating?, ?T? to 
        indicate ?Terminating?, and  ?I? to indicate ?Indirect?. For example, 
        O-SSP is the acronym of Originating SIP Service Provider.  
         
     3. Reference Architecture 

        The diagram below provides the reader with a context for the VoIP use 
        cases in this draft.

     4. Contexts of Use Cases 

        Use cases are sorted into two general groupings: Static and On-demand 
        Peering [15]. Each grouping can further sub-divided to Direct Peering 
        and Indirect Peering [15]. Though there may be some overlap among the 
        use cases in these categories, there are different requirements 
        between the scenarios.  Each use-case has to specify how a few core 
        operations which are to be performed by its members.

     Internet-Draft draft-ietf-speermint-voip-consolidated-usecases Aug 2008 
         

        These can include: 

        1) Peer Discovery via a Look-up function to determine the 
        administrative domain to direct the call to. 

        2) A location determination process that serves to create the Session 
        Establishment Data (SED). Examples: Public User-ENUM, public 
        Infrastructure ENUM, private ENUM tree, SIP Redirect, DUNDi. 

        3) Next Hop determination based on the SED. If a location function 
        query did not return an URI of the form sip:user@IP-address, then the 
        originating SSP has to translate the domain part of the URI to an IP-
        address (plus perhaps fall-backs) in order to contact the next hop. 
        Examples: RFC3263 in the public DNS. RFC3263 in a federation private 
        DNS. RFC3263 in the public DNS with split-DNS, P2P SIP, modified 
        RFC3263 in the public DNS (e.g. a federation-specific prefix to the 
        domain name). 

        4) Call setup ? SSPs that are interconnecting to one another may also 
        define specifics on what SIP features need to be used when contacting 
        the next hop in order to a) reach the next hop at all and b) to prove 
        that the sender is a legitimate peering partner. 

        Examples: hard-code transport (TCP/UDP/TLS), non-standard port 
        number, specific source IP address (e.g. in a private L3 network), 
        which TLS client certificate to use, other authentication scheme. 

        5) Call reception ? This step serves to ensure that the type of 
        relationship (static or on-demand, indirect or direct) is understood. 
        For instance, the receiving side border elements need to determine 
        whether the INVITE it just received really came from a member of the 
        federation. This is the flip side of step four. Example: verify TLS 
        cert, check incoming interface/VLAN,check source IP address against a 
        configured list of valid ones. 

     5. Use Cases 

        Please note there are intra-domain message flows within the use cases 
        to serve as supporting background information.  Only inter-domain 
        communications are germane to Speermint.  

     5.1. Static Peering Use Cases 

        Static Peering [15] describes two SSP form the peering relationship 
        with pre-association.  Pre-association is a prerequisite to static 
        peering.

     5.1.1. Static Direct Peering Use Case 

        This is the simplest form of a peering use case. Two SSP negotiate 
        and agree to establish a SIP peering relation. The peer connection is 
        statically configured and directly connected two SSP. The peers may 
        exchange peer information such as DSCP policies, subscriber SIP-URI 
        and proxy location prior to establishing the connection. They only 
        accept traffic originating directly from the trusted peer.

        Figure 2 Direct Peering 
         

        The following is a high-level depiction of the use case. 

          1. UAC initiates a call via SIP INVITE 

          2. O-Proxy queries for SED information from a routing database.  

          3. Routing database entity replies with SED to called party 

          4. Call sent to terminating domain proxy. 

          5. T-Proxy determines called party status and directs call to 
             called party. 

          6. RTP is established between UAC and UAS.

     5.1.1.1. Administrative characteristics 

        The static direct peering use case is typically implemented in a 
        scenario where exists a strong degree of trust between the two 
        administrative domains. Both administrative domains normally sign a 
        peer agreement which state clearly the peering policies and terms.  

     5.1.1.2. Options and Nuances 

        In Figure 2, O-Proxy and T-Proxy connect directly. An operator may 
        decide to deploy a SBE between its proxy and the peer network. 
        Normally, the operator will deploy the SBE in the edge of its 
        administrative domain. The signaling traffic will pass between two 
        networks through the SBE. The operator has many reasons to deploy a 
        SBE. For example, the proxy may use RFC1918 addresses that are not 
        routable in the peer operator network. The SBE can perform a NAT 
        function. Also, the SBE eases the operation cost for deploying or 
        removing L5 network elements. Consider the deployment architecture 
        where multiple proxies connect to a single SBE. An operator can add 
        or remove a proxy without coordinating with the peer operator. The 
        peer operator ?sees? only the SBE. As long as the SBE maintain 
        intact, the peer operator does not need to be notified.  

        When an operator deploys a SBE, the operator is required to advertise 
        the SBE to the peer LRF so that the peer operator can locate the SBE 
        and route the traffic to the SBE accordingly. 

        SBE deployment is a decision within an administrative domain. Either 
        administrative domain or both administrative domains can decide to 
        deploy SBE. To the peer network, most important is to identify the 
        next-hop address. Whether next-hop is a proxy or SBE, the peer 
        network will not see any difference. 

     5.1.2. Static Direct via Assisting Entity (Hub/Spoke) 

        The difference between Direct and Indirect Use Cases is the O-SSP 
        invokes an I-SSP to forward requests to T-SSP blindly, regardless of 
        LUF or LRF. This use case is also referring to a ?transit? model of 
        SIP peering. Similar to the On-demand Direct Use Case model, the I-
        SSP must publicly announce that it accepts request and is capable to 
        route the request to the T-SSP. 

        Another On-demand Indirect Use Case is the Hub-and-Spoke use case. An 
        Assisting entity where only the LRF resides, serves as the hub for 
        multiple SSPs. Each SSP is the spoke to the Assisting Entity which 
        does not need to have direct L5 connections among other SSPs. To 
        originate a call to a T-SSP, the O-SSP will query the Assisting

        Entity?s LRF. The response will facilitate indirect or direct 
        communications to the O-SSP. The Assisting entity can route the 
        Session to one of its served SSP.  The routing logic in the Assisted 
        Entity is hidden to the SSP. Figure 4 shows the high-level network 
        setup.

     5.1.2.1. Administrative Characteristics 

        The Hub-and-Spoke Use Case is commonly used in a Registry or 
        Directory call model, where both O-SSP and T-SSP do not have direct 
        Layer-5 connectivity. O-SSP and T-SSP choose an I-SSP and forms a 
        trusted relationship to I-SSP. As such, the I-SSP is the hub served 
        multiple spoke SSPs. Spoke SSP only have trusted relationship with I-
        SSP. Spoke SSPs do not have trusted relationship among themselves. 
        They use I-SSP to assist them to route the signaling traffic. That 
        said, if Spoke SSPs have direct Layer-3 connectivity, Spoke SSP can 
        choose not to use I-SSP assistance for media traffic. 

     5.1.2.2. Options and Nuances 

        T-SSP shares the same problems of which On-demand Indirect Use Case 
        suffers. T-SSP should apply filter rules for VoIP spam. O-SSP, T-SSP 
        and I-SSP can deploy SBE and DBE for NAT traversal, admission control 
        and codec Transcoding.

     5.1.3. Static Indirect Use Cases 

        Similar to the Static Direct Peering Use Case, O-SSP and T-SSP has 
        pre-arranged assignment for the peer relationship. The difference 
        between Static Direct Use Case and Static Indirect Use Case lies with 
        the Layer-5 relationship O-SSP and T-SSP maintain.  In the Indirect 
        use case, the O-SSP and T-SSP do not have direct Layer-5 
        connectivity. They require one or multiple Indirect Domains to assist 
        routing the SIP messages and possibly the associated media. 

     5.1.4. Static Indirect Peering ? SIP and Media via I-SSP 

        In the following use case, all signaling and media between the O-SSP 
        and T-SSP flows through another SSP (Indirect SSP).

             and LF for the O-SSP. In this setup, the query traverses the 
             administrative boundary between the originating and the Indirect 
             domains (as illustrated in Fig. 3).   

          3. The result of the query will be the I-SSP?s SBE (I-SBE) that is 
             interconnected to the T-SSP and the O-SBE.  

          4. O-Proxy signals the I-SBE via the O-SBE.   

          5. I-SBE routes call to T-SBE within T-SSP. 

          6. T-SBE signals T-Proxy. 

          7. T-Proxy signals the called party. (UAS) 

          8. RTP may be established between UAC and UAS via DBE path 
             typically coordinated by the I-SSP. 

         
     5.1.4.1. Administrative characteristics 

        The Static Indirect Use Case is normally implemented in cases where 
        no direct interconnection exists between originating and terminating 
        domains due to either business or physical constraints.   

        O-SSP .--. I-SSP = Relationship O-I 

        In the O-I relationship, typical policies, features or functions that 
        deem this relationship necessary are NP, Ubiquity of termination 
        options, and masquerading of originating VoIP network gear. 

        T-SSP .--. I-SSP = Relationship T-I 

        In the T-I relationship, typical policies, features or functions 
        observed consist of codec ?scrubbing?, anonimizing, and transcoding. 

        I-SSP must record-route and stay in the signalling path. T-SSP will 
        not accept message directly sent from O-SSP. 

     5.1.4.2. Options and Nuances 

        Similar to the Static Direct Peering Use Case, O-SSP and T-SSP may 
        deploy SBE and DBE for NAT traverse, security Transcoding, etc. I-SSP 
        can also deploy SBE and DBE for similar reasons. (as depicted in Fig. 
        3)

     5.1.5. Static Indirect ? Signaling via I-SSP 

        The static indirect use case with signaling only shares many 
        properties with the static indirect use case for signaling and media.  
        There must exist a pre-associate between the O-SSP and T-SSP, but the 
        situation only pertains to administrative relations.  The O and T 
        SSPs do not have direct Layer-5 connectivity; therefore require one 
        or multiple Indirect Domains to assist routing the SIP messages.

     5.2. On-demand Peering Use Cases 

        On-demand Peering [15] describes two SSPs form the peering 
        relationship without a pre-arranged agreement. 

     5.2.1. On-demand Direct Peering Use Case 

        The basis of this use case is built on the fact that there is NOT a 
        pre-established relationship between the O-SSP and the T-SSP. The O-
        SSP and T-SSP did not share any information prior to the dialog 
        initiation request. When the O-Proxy invokes the LUF and LRF on the 
        R-URI, the terminating user information must be publicly available. 
        Besides, when the O-Proxy routes the request to the T-Proxy, the T-
        Proxy must accept the request without any pre-association with O-SSP. 

        The call flow is identical to the Static Direct Peering Use Case 
        shown in Fig 2. 

     5.2.1.1. Administrative characteristics 

        The On-demand Direct Peering Use Case is typically implemented in a 
        scenario where the T-SSP allows any O-SSP to reach its serving 
        subscribers. T-SSP administrative domain does not require any pre-
        arranged agreement to accept the call. T-SSP makes its subscribers 
        information available in public. This model mimics the Internet email 
        model. Sender does not need an pre-arranged agreement to send email 
        to the receiver. 

     5.2.1.2. Options and Nuances 

        Similar to Static Direct Peering Use Case, O-SSP and T-SSP can decide 
        to deploy SBE. T-SSP is open to the public, T-SSP should prepare to 
        suffer from the spam problem existing in email system. VoIP spamming 
        is considered more annoying than email spamming to the subscribers. 
        T-SSP should apply rules to filter spammed calls.

     5.3. Federations 

        This section discusses the federation concept, explains which 
        technical parameters make up the foundation of a federation and 
        provides examples. 

        The concrete implementation details (e.g. "direct with one SBE" 
        versus "direct with two SBEs") can involve all the use cases thus far 
        described in the document. 

     5.3.1. Federation Considerations 

         
     5.3.2. Federation Examples 

          This section lists some examples of how federations can operate. 
           
     5.3.2.1. Trivial Federations 

          A private peering arrangement between two SSPs is a special case of 
          a federation. These two SSP have agreed to exchange calls amongst 
          themselves and they have set up whatever LUF/LS/SBE plus Layer 3 
          infrastructure they need to route and complete the calls.  This can 
          be in a direct or indirect manner, but usually follows the direct 
          call model. 
           
          It is thus not needed to treat bi-lateral peerings as conceptually 
          different to federation-based peering. 
           
          On the other extreme, the set of all SSPs implementing an open SIP 
          service according to RFCs 3261/3263/3761 also fulfills the 
          definition of a federation.  In that case, the technical rules are 
          contained in these three RFCs, the LS is the public DNS. Whether 
          some of these SSPs use SBCs as border elements is not relevant. 
           
          The administrative model of this federation is the "email model": 
          There is no "member list", any SIP server operating on the Internet 
          which implements call routing according to these RFCs is implicitly 
          a member of that federation. No business relationship is needed 
          between "members", thus no money is likely to change hands for 
          terminating calls. There is no contractual protection against 
          nuisance calls, SPIT, or denial of service attacks.

     5.3.2.2. Access List based 

          If running an open SIP proxy is not desired, then a group of SSPs 
          which want to allow calls from each other can collect the list of 
          IP addresses of all their border elements. 
           
          This list is redistributed to all members which use it to configure 
          firewalls in front of their ingress elements.  Thus calls from 
          other members of this federation are accepted while calls from 
          other hosts on the Internet are blocked. 
           
          Whether SSPs deploy SBEs as border elements is not relevant.  Call 
          routing can still be done via standard RFC rules. 
           
          Whenever a new member joins this club every other SSP needs to 
          adapt its filter rules. 
           
     5.3.2.3. TLS based Federations 

          Another option to restrict incoming calls to federation members is 
          to use Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates as access 
          control. This works best if the federation runs a certificate 
          authority (CA) which signs the TLS keys of each member SSP.  Thus 
          the ingress element of a SSP needs to check only whether the client 
          certificate presented by the calling SIP proxy contains a proper 
          signature from that CA. 
           
          Adding support for Certificate Revocation Lists solves the issue of 
          blocking calls from former members of that federation.  The main 
          benefit of this model is that no changes need to be made at the 
          ingress element of all old members whenever a SSP joins that 
          federation. 
           
     5.3.2.4. Central SIP Proxy 

          One way to simplify the management of these firewall rules is to 
          route all SIP messages via a central proxy. 
           
          In that case, all federation members just need to open up their 
          ingress elements to requests from that central server. A new SSP 
          just triggers a change in the configuration of this box and not at 
          all other SSPs. 
           
          While centralized solutions may entail typical hub-and-spoke 
          architecture considerations, the added overall federation 
          scalability with respect to the number of interconnects required,

          their associated policies and management make this approach quite 
          popular today. 
           
          This is an example of Indirect Peering. 
      

     6. Architecture, scalability and business scalability 

          The network architecture which in the case centralized model would 
          reflect a hub and spoke model - should be weighed against a 
          distributed model. While such a centralized model presents well-
          known network and server scalability challenges, a distributed 
          model requires higher interconnection complexity, reflected in 
          provisioning and the need for the maintenance of such 
          relationships.  
           
     7. Security Considerations 

          This document introduces no new security considerations.  However, 
          it is important to note that session interconnect, as described in 
          this document, has a wide variety of security issues that should be    
          considered in documents addressing both protocol and use case  
          analyzes. 
           
     8. IANA Considerations 

          This document creates no new requirements on IANA namespaces    
          [RFC2434].
