1.  Introduction

   The QUIC Transport Protocol [RFC9000] provides a secure, multiplexed
   connection for transmitting reliable streams of application data.

   This document defines an extension to the QUIC transport protocol
   which supports reporting multiple packet receive timestamps using a
   new ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMPS frame type.

2.  Motivation

   QUIC congestion control ([RFC9002]) supports sampling round-trip time
   (RTT) by measuring the time from when a packet was sent to when it is
   acknowledged.  However, more precise delay signals measured via
   packet receive timestamps have the potential to improve the accuracy
   of network bandwidth measurements and the effectiveness of congestion
   control, especially for latency-critical applications such as real-
   time video conferencing or game streaming.

   Numerous existing algorithms and techniques leverage receive receive
   timestamps to improve transport performance.  Examples include:

   *  The WebRTC congestion control algorithm described in
      [I-D.ietf-rmcat-gcc] uses the difference between packet inter-
      departure and packet inter-arrival times as the input to its
      delay-based controller.

   *  The pathChirp ([RRBNC]) technique estimates available bandwidth by
      measuring inter-arrival time of multiple packets.

   Notably, these techniques require receive timestamps for more than
   one packet per round-trip in order to best measure the network.

3.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

4.  Extension Negotiation

   The use of the ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMPS frame is negotiated using the
   following two transport parameters (Section 7.2 of [RFC9000]):

   max_receive_timestamps_per_ack (TBD):  A variable-length integer
      indicating that the sending endpoint would like to receive
      ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMPS frames from the peer containing no more
      than the given maximum number of receive timestamps.

      Upon receiving this parameter with a non-zero value, the peer
      SHOULD send ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMPS frames instead of ACK frames if
      new receive timestamp information is available.  The peer MAY
      still send regular ACK frames (e.g. if no timing information is
      available), in which case the endpoint MUST still support
      processing regular ACK frames as defined by Section 19.3 of
      [RFC9000].

      Each ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMPS frame sent MUST NOT contain more than
      the specified maximum number of receive timestamps, but MAY
      contain fewer or none.

   receive_timestamps_exponent (TBD):  A variable-length integer

      indicating the exponent to be used when encoding and decoding
      timestamp delta fields in ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMPS frames sent by
      the peer (see Section 5.1).  If this value is absent, a default
      value of 0 is assumed (indicating microsecond precision).  Values
      above 20 are invalid.

4.1.  Receive Timestamp Basis

   Endpoints which send ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMPS frames must determine a
   value, receive_timestamp_basis, relative to which all receive
   timestamps for the session will be reported (see Section 5.1).

   The value of receive_timestamp_basis MUST be less than the smallest
   receive timestamp reported, and MUST remain constant for the entire
   duration of the session.

   TODO: Discuss (here or below) why receive timestamps are reported
   relative to the basis, rather than in absolute time to avoid clock
   synchronization between endpoints.

5.  ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMPS Frame

   Receivers send ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMPS (type=TBD) frames in place of--
   and in the same manner as--regular ACK frames as described in
   Section 13.2 of [RFC9000].  However, ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMPS frames
   contain additional fields to report packet receive timestamps.

   ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMPS frames are formatted as shown in Figure 1.

   ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMPS Frame {
     Type (i) = TBD
     // Fields of the existing ACK (type=0x02) frame:
     Largest Acknowledged (i),
     ACK Delay (i),
     ACK Range Count (i),
     First ACK Range (i),
     ACK Range (..) ...,
     // Additional fields for ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMPS:
     Timestamp Range Count (i),
     Timestamp Ranges (..) ...,
   }

               Figure 1: ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMPS Frame Format

   The fields Largest Acknowledged, ACK Delay, ACK Range Count, First
   ACK Range, and ACK Range are the same as for ACK (type=0x02) frames
   specified in Section 19.3 of [RFC9000].

Internet-Draft           QUIC Receive Timestamps            October 2021


   ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMPS frames contain the following additional
   fields:

   Timestamp Range Count:  A variable-length integer specifying the
      number of Timestamp Range fields in the frame.

   Timestamp Ranges:  Ranges of receive timestamps for contiguous
      packets in descending packet number order; see Section 5.1.

5.1.  Timestamp Ranges

   Each Timestamp Range describes a series of contiguous packet receive
   timestamps in descending sequential packet number (and descending
   timestamp) order.  Timestamp Ranges consist of a Gap indicating the
   largest packet number in the range, followed by a list of Timestamp
   Deltas describing the relative receive timestamps for each contiguous
   packet in the Timestamp Range (descending).

   Note that reporting receive timestamps for packets received out of
   order is not supported.  Specifically: for any packet number P for
   which a receive timestamp T is reported, all reports for packet
   numbers less than P must have timestamps less than or equal to T; and
   all reports for packet numbers greater than P must have timestamps
   greater than or equal to T.

   Timestamp Ranges are structured as shown in Figure 2.

   Timestamp Range {
     Gap (i),
     Timestamp Delta Count (i),
     Timestamp Delta (i) ...,
   }

                      Figure 2: Timestamp Range Format

   The fields that form each Timestamp Range are:

   Gap:  A variable-length integer indicating the largest packet number
      in the Timestamp Range as follows:

      For the first Timestamp Range: Gap is the difference between (a)
      the Largest Acknowledged packet number in the frame and (b) the
      largest packet in the current (first) Timestamp Range.

      For subsequent Timestamp Ranges: Gap is the difference between (a)
      the packet number two lower than the smallest packet number in the
      previous Timestamp Range and (b) the largest packet in the current
      Timestamp Range.

Internet-Draft           QUIC Receive Timestamps            October 2021


   Timestamp Delta Count:  A variable-length integer indicating the
      number of Timestamp Deltas in the current Timestamp Range.

      The sum of Timestamp Delta Counts for all Timestamp Ranges in the
      frame MUST NOT exceed max_receive_timestamps_per_ack as specified
      in Section 4.

   Timestamp Deltas:  Variable-length integers encoding the receive
      timestamp for contiguous packets in the Timestamp Range in
      descending packet number order as follows:

      For the first Timestamp Delta of the first Timestamp Range in the
      frame: the value is the difference between (a) the receive
      timestamp of the largest packet in the Timestamp Range (indicated
      by Gap) and (b) the session receive_timestamp_basis (see
      Section 4.1), decoded as described below.

      For all other Timestamp Deltas: the value is the difference
      between (a) the receive timestamp specified by the previous
      Timestamp Delta and (b) the receive timestamp of the current
      packet in the Timestamp Range, decoded as described below.

      All Timestamp Delta values are decoded by mulitplying the value in
      the field by 2 to the power of the receive_timestamps_exponent
      transport parameter received by the sender of the
      ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMPS frame (see Section 4):

6.  Discussion

6.1.  Best-Effort Behavior

   Receive timestamps are sent on a best-effort basis and endpoints MUST
   gracefully handle scenarios where receive timestamp information for
   sent packets is not received.  Examples of such scenarios are:

   *  The packet containing the ACK_RECEIVE_TIMESTAMP frame is lost.

   *  The sender truncates the number of timestamps sent in order to (a)
      avoid sending more than max_receive_timestamps_per_ack
      (Section 4); or (b) fit the ACK frame into a packet.
