     Abstract 

        This document describes the motivation for benchmarking MPLS traffic 
        engineering (TE) convergence using RSVP, the Resource ReserVation 
        Protocol as an underlying signaling protocol. This document provides 
        an overview of the work item and a separate methodology and 
        terminology document will be generated if there is enough interest in 
        this area. This work complements MPLS protection benchmarking work, 
        which is already being pursued in the Benchmarking working group at 
        IETF.

     Internet-Draft       Motivation for Benchmarking              March-2007 
                              MPLS TE Convergence            
         

         
        1. Introduction 


        MPLS  traffic  engineering  enables  service  providers  to  achieve 
        efficient  utilization  of  available  network  resources  including 
        available  bandwidth  without  adding  additional  resources  in 
        proportion to the increased demand. In addition MPLS TE helps 
        improve QoS and resiliency against unplanned node or link failures 
        in the network. This in essence allows service providers to offer 
        strict service level agreements (SLAs) to consumers. These high-
        availability  and  faster  recovery  capabilities  of  MPLS  TE  have 
        motivated many service providers to consider migrating or have 
        already migrated all their services (i.e. voice, data, video, and 
        wireless) over IP/MPLS based networks. It is important, as network 
        size grows, that MPLS TE enabled label switched paths (or tunnels) 
        are able to scale to thousands of LSPs and converge the routes bound 
        to the tunnels while keeping memory and CPU resource utilization to 
        a minimal value.  

        As MPLS TE becomes more widely accepted as the primary protocol for 
        the  network  core,  the  need  for  common  benchmarking  of  its 
        performance  and  scalability  is  of  great  importance.  In  this 
        motivational  draft,  we  elaborate  on  the  key  performance  and 
        scalability metrics that one needs to consider for designing an MPLS 
        traffic engineering network. 

         

        2. Existing definitions  

      
        For the sake of clarity and continuity this RFC adopts the 
        template  or  definitions  set  out  in  Section  2  of  RFC  1242.  
        Definitions are indexed and grouped together in sections for ease of 
        reference. The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", 
        "SHALL  NOT",  "SHOULD",  "SHOULD  NOT",  "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY",  and 
        "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in 
        RFC 2119. The reader is encouraged to be familiar with the commonly 
        used BFD terms, some of which are defined in the appendix.

        3. Factors impacting MPLS TE Scalability and Performance 

         

         3.1. RSVP Refresh reduction 

              RSVP refresh reduction consists of reliable, summary and bundle      
              messages to reduce the number of messages exchanged between the  
              nodes. 
      

         3.2. RSVP Authentication 

              Authentication is used for security purpose and has impact on    
              the scalability and convergence performance of MPLS traffic  
              engineering. 
      

         3.3. RSVP Rate-limit parameter  

              Rate limiting is used by the vendors to pace the RSVP messages  
              on the output queue. Rate limiting is also a key factor in MPLS  
              TE scalability and performance. 
         

         3.4. CPU utilization at the time of signaling 

              CPU Utilization of the DUT at the time of signaling is a key  
              factor that one need to consider when designing the network. 
      

         3.5. CPU Utilization at stead state 

              CPU Utilization of the DUT at stead state is also a key factor  
              in designing the network. 
      

         3.6. Memory Usage 

              Memory usage of the DUT is important to identify in a scale  
              network.
