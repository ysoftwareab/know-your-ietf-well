   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current 
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 
   3410 [RFC3410]. 
    
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the 
   Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally accessed 
   through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).  Objects in the 
   MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of 
   Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB module that is 
   compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,RFC 2578 [RFC2578], 
   STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580[RFC2580]. 
    
4  Overview 
 
 
   The Infiniband Architecture [IBTAArch] is defined by the Infiniband Trade 
   Association.  Infiniband is designed to provide low latency high bandwidth 
   interconnect in a computing environment.  This document will define the 
   objects related to managing the Subnet Manager, which are responsible for 
   configuring and monitoring of Infiniband subnet.  

4.1 IB Subnet Manager Configuration Group  
     
   This group contains all Subnet Managers that are active on this device.  
   An IB device can be attached to one or more IB subnets.  If the IB device 
   is hosting a Subnet Manager, responsible for managing the attached IB 
   subnet, a row is present in ibSmConfigTable.  

4.2 IB Subnet Manager Node Information Group  
    
   This table contains the node information for the IB nodes that are managed 
   by the Subnet Managers active on this device.  

4.3 IB Subnet Manager Port Information Group  
     
   This table contains the port information for the IB ports that are managed 
   by the Subnet Managers active on this device.

4.4 IB Subnet Manager Switch Information Group  
          
   This table contains the switch information for the IB switches that are 
   managed by the Subnet Managers active on this device.  
    

4.5 IB Subnet Manager Partition Group  
     
   This table contains the partition groups that are managed by the Subnet 
   Managers active on this device.  
 

4.6 IB Subnet Manager Multicast Information Group  
     
   This groups contains the information for the IB multicast groups that are 
   managed by the Subnet Managers active on this device.  

4.7 IB Subnet Manager Path Group  
     
   This table contains the path information between two IB end-nodes that 
   are managed by the Subnet Managers active on this device.  
       

4.8 IB Subnet Manager Information Group  
       
   This group contains a table of information regarding other Subnet 
   Managers that are on the same IB subnet as the Subnet Managers active 
   on this device.  
    

4.9 IB Subnet Manager Link Information Group 
    
   This group contains a table of information regarding to the physical link 
   topology of the IB subnets. 

4.10 IB Subnet Manager Path Information Group 
    
   This group contains two tables for accessing IB Path records: 
   ibSmPathReqTable should be used to initiate query of Path records, and 
   then ibSmPathResultTable should be used to retrieve the query results. 

4.11 IB Subnet Manager MultiPath Information Group 
    
   This group contains two tables for accessing IB MultiPath records: 
   ibSmMultiPathReqTable should be used to initiate query of MultiPath 
   records, and then ibSmMultiPathResultTable should be used to retrieve

   the query results. 

4.12 IB Subnet Manager Trace Information Group 
    
   This group contains two tables for accessing IB Trace records:  
   ibSmTraceReqTable should be used to initiate query of Trace records, and 
   then ibSmTraceResultTable should be used to retrieve the query results. 

4.13 IB Subnet Manager Service Information Group 
    
   This group contains two tables:  ibSmServiceTable should be used to 
   retrieve Service records, and ibSmServiceAssociationTable should be used 
   to manage Service Key to Service Name mappings. 

4.14 IB Subnet Manager Switch SL to VL Map Group 
     
   This group contains a table of map between SL to VL for the switches that 
   are managed by the Subnet Managers active on this device.  

4.15 IB Subnet Manager Channel Adapter (CA) SL to VL Map Group  
     
   This group contains a table of the map between SL to VL for the channel 
   adapters and routers that are managed by the Subnet Managers active on 
   this device.  
  

4.16 IB Subnet Manager VL Arbitration Group  
     
   This group contains a table of VL arbitration for the ports that are 
   managed by the Subnet Managers active on this device.

   -- ibSmMultiPathReqSessionId is a positive pseudo-random 32-bit integer  
   -- generated by the client.  This number should be based on per request, 
   -- and should not be reused by the client.  Before the client creates  
   -- the row, it should try to do a GET operation to ensure the number is  
   -- not being used currently.  If it detects a conflict, the client should  
   -- re-generate another random value and try again.  When a row is  
   -- successfully created in ibSmMultiPathReqTable, that means a request 
   -- of the path has been issued. 
   -- 
   -- ibSmMultiPathResultTable is used to retrieve the query results.  The 
   -- client should use the same value of ibSmMultiPathReqSessionId as  
   -- ibSmMultiPathResultSessionId to retrieve the results. 
   -- 
   -- The management application should delete the row it created from  
   -- ibSmMultiPathReqTable after it finishes retrieving the results.   
   -- This will effectively remove the results from  
   -- ibSmMultiPathResultTable.  It is suggested that the MIB agent remove

   -- and should not be reused by the client.  Before the client creates  
   -- the row, it should try to do a GET operation to ensure the number is  
   -- not being used currently.  If it detects a conflict, the client should  
   -- re-generate another random value and try again.  When a row is  
   -- successfully created in ibSmTraceReqTable, that means a request 
   -- of the path has been issued. 
   -- 
   -- ibSmTraceResultTable is used to retrieve the query results.  The

   -- The management application should delete the row it created from

7  Revision History 
    
   This section should be removed when this document is published as an RFC. 
 

7.1 Changes from <draft-yang-ib-subnet-management-mib-00.txt> 
    
   Cheng Yang joined as a co-author of the draft. 
    
   Most tables have been revised. 
    
   ibSmPathInfo group has been remodeled. 
    
   ibSmMultiPathInfo group has been added. 
    
   ibSmTraceInfo group has been added. 
    
   ibSmServiceAssociationTable has been added. 
    
   ibsmLinkTable has been added. 
    
   Linear Forwarding, Random Forwarding and Multicast Forwarding tables 
   have been removed because of no interest. 
    
   Revision History section has been added to keep track of updates to the 
   MIB. 
    
   MIB has been updated to reflect changes in InfiniBand Architecture 
   Specification Volume 1,Release 1.1 [IBTAArch] 
    
    
8  Security Considerations 
    
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with 
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects may 
   be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The 
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper 
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.  These are 
   the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: 
    
   TBD: <list the tables and objects and state why they are sensitive> 
    
   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a 
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or 
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to control 
   even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even 
   encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network 
   via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their

   sensitivity/vulnerability: 
    
   TBD: <list the tables and objects and state why they are sensitive> 
    
   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.  Even 
   if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, 
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access 
   and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB module. 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as 
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including 
   full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication 
   and privacy). 
    
   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.  
   Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic 
   security.  It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that 
   the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly 
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) 
   that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) 
   them.
