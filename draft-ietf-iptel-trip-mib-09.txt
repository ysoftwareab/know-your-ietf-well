Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the MIB (Management Information Base)
   module for use with network management protocols in the Internet
   community. In particular, it describes a set of managed objects that
   are used to manage TRIP (Telephony Routing over IP) devices.

1.   The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB module objects are
   generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol
   (SNMP). Objects in this MIB module are defined using the mechanisms
   defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo
   specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is
   described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579]
   and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

2.   Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes a set of managed objects that are used
   to schedule management operations periodically or at specified dates
   and times.  Since TRIP [RFC3219] is modeled after the Border Gateway
   Protocol (BGP-4) [RFC1771], the managed objects for TRIP are also
   modeled after RFC1657 - Definitions of Managed Objects for the
   Fourth Version of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP-4) using SMIv2
   [RFC1657].

3.   Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP-0014
   [BCP0014].

4.   Overview

   This MIB module provides managed objects for TRIP devices defined in
   Telephony Routing over IP [RFC3219].  TRIP is an inter-domain
   application-layer control protocol that exchanges information
   between TRIP location servers (LS) to provide efficient IP telephony
   routing.

5.   Structure of TRIP MIB

   This MIB module utilizes the framework described in RFC 2788
   [RFC2788] for management of multiple instances of TRIP from a single
   entity.  The Network Services Monitoring MIB module applTable will
   be populated with entries corresponding to each TRIP Location Server
   in the system.  Each TRIP Location Server will then have an
   applIndex associated with it.  The value assigned to applIndex will
   represent the distinct instance of TRIP.

Internet Draft                                             October 2003


   The TRIP MIB module contains the following groups of objects with
   each group as part of the management of a singular TRIP entity. Each
   group covers a section of functionality of TRIP:
   o The tripConfigGroup contains the common configuration objects
     applicable to all TRIP applications referenced by the applIndex.
   o The tripPeerTableConfigGroup contains the configuration objects
     applicable to all TRIP peers of the Location Server referenced by
     the applIndex.
   o The tripRouteGroup contains the configuration objects related to
     the routes of all TRIBs of this Location Server.
   o The tripItadTopologyGroup contains information about the topology
     of the TRIP ITADs concerning this Location Server.
   o The tripPeerTableStatsGroup contains the statistical objects
     applicable to all TRIP peers of the Location Server referenced by
     the applIndex.
   o The tripNotificationGroup contains notifications that the TRIP
     application can generate.
   o The tripNotifObjectGroup contains the objects needed by one or
     more of the notifications.


5.1  Textual Conventions

   The data types TripItad and TripId are used as textual conventions
   in this document.  A TRIP ITAD (IP Telephony Administrative Domain)
   is described in [RFC3219].  A TRIP ID is used as a distinct
   identifier for a TRIP Location Server.  A TripAppProtocol is used to
   identify an application protocol.  A TripAddressFamily is used to
   define an address family.  TripCommunityId is used as a distinct
   identifier for a TRIP community.  TripProtocolVersion depicts the
   version number of the TRIP protocol.  TripSendReceiveMode describes
   the operational mode of the TRIP application.

7.   Security Considerations

   The managed objects in this MIB module contain sensitive information
   since, collectively, they allow tracing and influencing of
   connections in TRIP devices and provide information of their
   connection characteristics.  As such, improper manipulation of the

Zinman/Walker/Jiang                                                  41

Internet Draft                                             October 2003

   objects represented by this MIB module MAY result in denial of
   service to a large number of availiable routes.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.
   Such objects MAY be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
   network environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-
   secure environment without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These objects include:

        tripCfgItad:
        Improper setting of tripCfgItad value can make all peer
        connections drop and not be re-established.

        tripCfgAdminStatus:
        Improper setting of tripCfgAdminStatus from up to down will
        cause the TRIP Location Server stop processing TRIP messages.

        tripCfgPort:
        Improper setting of tripCfgPort can cause the failure of a peer
        establishing a connection.

        tripCfgMinItadOriginationInterval,
        tripCfgMinRouteAdvertisementInterval:
        Improper configuration of these values MAY adversely affect
        local and global convergence of the routes advertised by this
        TRIP Location Server.

        tripPeerAdminStatus:
        Improper setting of tripPeerAdminStatus from up to down can
        cause significant disruption of the connectivity to the
        destination via the applicable remote TRIP Location Server
        peer.

        tripPeerConnectRetryInterval,tripPeerMaxRetryInterval:
        Improper configuration of these values can cause connections to
        be disrupted for extremely long time periods when otherwise
        they would be restored in a relatively short period of time.

        tripPeerHoldTimeConfigured, tripPeerKeepAliveConfigured:
        Improper configuration of these value can make TRIP peer
        sessions more fragile and less resilient to denial of service
        attacks.

   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB module that
   contain sensitive information regarding the operation of a network.
   For example, a TRIP Location Server peer's local and remote
   addresses might be sensitive for ISPs who want to keep interface
   addresses on TRIP Location Server confidential so as to prevent TRIP
   Location Server addresses used for a denial of service attack or
   address spoofing.

   Therefore, it is thus important to control even GET access to these
   objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when
   sending them over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP
   provide features for such a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is
   no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section
   8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms
   (for authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
