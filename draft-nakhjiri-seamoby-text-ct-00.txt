 Abstract 
    This document presents a context transfer proposal, greatly in 
    line with the current fast handover framework within Mobile IP WG 
    [3]. Namely, this proposal allows flow of MNÆs real time traffic 
    through a tunnel, while completing context transfer outside 
    timing critical path for handover. The context transfer procedure 
    is initiated at an instance of MNÆs choice in regard to layer 2 
    and 3 handover and MNÆs traffic. To add flexibility, the context 
    data is transferred outside the tunnel. Although this document 
    concentrates on a protocol proposal, the framework on which this 
    proposal is based, provides great amount of flexibility in 
    detailed design of context transfer. A minimum reliability 
    mechanism for ensuring quality of transferred context is added. 
    Specifically, the context update mechanism suggested here can not 
    be achieved by any transport protocol. Since this proposal is 
    written at a time, when transport requirements for context 
    transfer procedure are not specified, the reliability mechanisms 
    included should be treated as preliminary.

 1.      Introduction 
     
    The amount of signaling required during handovers in IP networks 
    [1] together with scarcity of bandwidth in most radio networks to 
    support this signaling traffic have created one of the major 
    obstacles in integrating IP based solutions into the most of 
    todayÆs wireless environments. To be specific, the combination of 
    the two mentioned factors would potentially result in 
    prohibitively large disruption in the flow of traffic for real 
    time applications. Various methods have been proposed to reduce or 
    eliminate the length of such disruption. Most of the work within 
    Mobile IP WG has been focused on minimizing the delay associated 
    with registration and change of routing information by allowing

    layer 3 handover signaling continue in concurrence with other 
    handover related events [2]. 
     
    However, applications running at MN would also have to provide 
    continuous support for various features such as security, QoS, 
    etc, even after handovers. The instantiation of the context 
    information at the new AR without re-negotiation by the MN is 
    called context transfer [4]. Since the early stages of the context 
    transfer requirement specification [5], it was clear that in order 
    to reduce the amount of perceived latency in handovers, the 
    context transfer procedure should also be optimized from a latency 
    point of view. 
     
    Low bandwidth in 3G cellular environments generally imposes a 
    limit on the amount of signaling that can be done over the air 
    during critical path. Recently a solution for Mobile IP handover 
    has been proposed [3], which allows the MN to keep its real time 
    traffic without any disruption until the MN chooses to engage in 
    L3 handover (acquisition of new CoA from new AR). The MN's traffic 
    is simply tunneled by the anchor AR to the new AR, which in turn 
    forwards the traffic to MN. The registration is postponed to MN's 
    earliest convenience. This solution removes L3 handover signaling 
    out of timing critical path and thereby reducing service 
    disruption due to layer 3 registration process. 
     
    The context transfer solution proposed in this draft, adopts the 
    above handover solution [3] and seeks to eliminate the context 
    transfer signaling out of timing critical path of network layer 
    handover. This proposal simply suggests that after a link layer 
    handover, the context still resides at anchor AR, rather than at 
    the new AR, until MN starts engaging in layer 3 handover and 
    adopts the new AR as the AR in charge of forwarding MNÆs traffic. 
    During that time, the old AR (anchor AR) is in charge of 
    processing MNÆs feature. Context transfer can be started and 
    completed along with delivery of data traffic and independent of 
    exact timing of handover completion. Once the context transfer is 
    completed reliably, the new AR simply takes over processing of 
    MNÆs service features. This way, this proposal ensures not only 
    continuous traffic forwarding and feature support, but also 
    ensures context reliability by preventing context mis-
    synchronization. The context transfer needs not to happen through 
    the tunnel. However, the tunnel for the data traffic MUST stay in 
    place until completion of context transfer. Once the context 
    transfer is complete, the traffic tunnel can be torn down.

 3.      Terminology 
     
    The next subsections define various terms used throughout this 
    document. Most of the terminology in this draft is in accordance 
    with Mobile IP and Seamoby WG drafts ([1]-[5]). Hence, new terms 
    or slight additions to the existing explanations are given here to 
    help understanding the concepts of this draft. 
     
    aAR         anchor AR 
     
    The access router, which handles routing of mobile node's traffic 
    and ensures support of features associated to MN's applications 
    and holds MN's contexts. This is also the AR, from which MN has 
    acquired its current CoA. 
     
    NAR         new AR 
  
    The AR, with which, the MN establishes link connections (maybe via 
    an access point) after the handover. 
     
    CaAR         context anchor AR 
     
    The AR that holds MN's context. Anchor AR is in general also 
    context anchor AR, This term is added to ease the understanding of 
    the concept: context transfer does not happen until MN acquires a 
    newCoA and changes anchor AR. 
     
    aCoA         anchor CoA 
     
    The care of address, CoA, that MN has acquired from its anchor AR 
    and uses for its IP traffic. 
     
    nCoA                new CoA 
     
    The CoA, that MN acquires from its new AR. Note that nCoA is not 
    aCoA until the newAR receives MN's context and starts act as MN's 
    anchor AR. In other word, it is possible that for a short period 
    of time MN holds an aCoA and nCoA. 
     
    feature CTTL         feature context time to live

    The time interval during which a feature context is relevant. The 
    length of this time interval (time to live: TTL) can be different 
    for different features, and different applications, e.g. TTL for 
    header compression context for voice traffic can be as small as 
    voice packet inter-arrival time, while TTL for IPsec context can 
    be as long as the MN stays within the same AR domain and TTL for 
    QoS somewhere in between. 
  
    Feature context retransmissions 
     
    In case transmission a context packet has failed, depending on the 
    TTL of the included feature context data, the lost data needs to 
    be retransmitted or updated. The short-lived feature contexts need 
    updates, while the longer-lived feature contexts need re-
    transmissions. This also makes the bundling of feature context 
    data into one or several packets an important design 
    consideration: the relation of various feature contexts, path MTU 
    and link RTT are among important factors in context data 
    fragmentation. 
     
    Feature Context update transfer 
     
    In case a feature TTL expires prior to completion of context 
    transfer and redirection of traffic, an update of that feature 
    context is necessary.  
     
    Note: Unlike context retransmissions, feature context update 
    transfer cannot be accomplished through a transport layer 
    protocol. 
     
 4.      Protocol overview 
     
    The motivation for this proposal is to eliminate the context 
    transfer delay from the critical path of network layer handover. 
    It is developed based on the mobility framework, in which, the 
    MNÆs traffic is forwarded through a tunnel between old AR and new 
    AR during handover. In other words, after the MN has completed an 
    L2 handover to the new AR, the traffic for the MN is simply 
    tunneled from the old AR to its new AR, until the MN decides to 
    have the new AR to route MN's traffic (MN changes its CoA). During 
    that time, the new AR continues to forward the traffic between MN 
    and old AR without looking into the details of the features 
    associated with the MN. During this time, the old AR (anchor AR) 
    is in charge of processing MNÆs feature. Hence, old AR acts as an 
    anchor AR can also hold mobile nodeÆs context information. Hence 
    the MN's context information is not transferred from old AR to nAR 
    until MN acquires its nCoA and decides to use the nAR as new 
    forwarding agent. 
     
    Context transfer can be started and completed along with delivery 
    of data traffic and independent of exact timing of handover 
    completion. Once the context transfer is completed reliably, the 
    new AR simply takes over processing of MNÆs service features. This

 Internet Draft            Time Efficient CT              October 2001 



    way, this proposal ensures not only continuous traffic forwarding 
    and feature support, but also ensures context reliability by 
    preventing context mis-synchronization. The context transfer needs 
    not to happen through the tunnel. However, the tunnel for the data 
    traffic MUST stay in place until completion of context transfer. 
    Once the context transfer is complete, the traffic tunnel can be 
    torn down. 
     
    This provides the natural mechanism for application continuity as 
    well as synchronization of time sensitive context information such 
    as header compression states. 
     
    Note: Keeping the context at anchor AR until a change of CoA by MN 
    also provides sufficient protection against unnecessary context 
    transfers in ping-ponging or handover to the third AR scenarios.  
     
    The following steps describe the proposed context transfer 
    procedure: 
     
       -The bi-directional tunnel between old AR (anchor AR) and new 
       AR is used to the exchange traffic between MN and aAR via new 
       AR until the MN acquires its nCoA. 
        
       -During this period the MN's context resides at anchor AR. The 
       new AR continues to forward the traffic between MN and aAR, 
       without looking into the details of the features associated 
       with the new users. 
        
       -Once the MN has acquired its nCoA and is ready to changes its 
       anchor AR from oldAR to newAR, the two ARs can engage in 
       context transfer.  
        
       -The command to start context transfer is issued by MN through 
       an authenticated context transfer request message sent by MN to 
       aAR through nAR (not tunneled). MN sends this message after one 
       of the event triggers described in 5.1. As a trigger, we choose 
       registration request or binding update depending on Mobile IP 
       version. Also, note that it is possible to have the MN send the 
       context transfer request to the new AR, in case, it is desired 
       that the new AR starts context transfer signaling. 
        
       -After receiving the context transfer request with proper 
       authentication, the anchor AR starts the context transfer 
       procedure through context transfer data message. The context 
       information can be sent as next header information associated 
       with a data flow or in separate packets. We prefer the latter 
       approach, at this point. 
        
       -In case reliability in context delivery is required and a non-
       reliable transport protocol is chosen in the future, we have 
       proposed optional reliability mechanisms with details explained 
       in sections 5 and 7.

       -As soon as the context transfer is complete, either the bi-
       directional tunnel is torn down  (nAR or aAR sends a HRqst to 
       aAR with lifetime=0 ) or the aAR stops handling the MNÆs 
       feature processing (more in 5.4 and 5.5). 
        
       -Once the tunnel is torn down and MN is ready to use its nCoA, 
       the new AR will handle routing and feature support for MN's 
       traffic. 
     
 4.1.   Message flow 
     
    The following shows the message flow for the protocol. Note that 
    the reliability related messages in the protocol, are not included 
    in the protocol overview above and figure below. This is to retain 
    the flexibility of the protocol towards the currently uncertain 
    reliability requirements for context transfer. The detail formats 
    of these message are described in 4.5 and 5.

    reliability) 
     
 4.2.   Advantages 
     
    The benefits of this proposal can be listed as following: 
     
       1-The Context transfer is eliminated from timing critical path. 
       Since the tunnel stays in place, until nCoA for the MN is 
       operative, a great amount of flexibility in choosing the timing 
       for context transfer trigger is provided. Context transfer can 
       be done regardless of exact timing of handover messages. Also, 
       it provides great amount of flexibility in choice the network 
       element, starting context transfer signaling. A list of viable 
       triggers is provided in 5.1. 
        
       2-It reduces network traffic load due to context transfer, in 
       cases MN moves too quickly between several ARs, ping-pongs 
       between same pair of ARs. Only when MN is ready to acquire 
       nCoA, and the new AR is known, context transfer is done. In 
       case MN moves to a third AR before changing its CoA, the aAR 
       simply tears the wireless end of tunnel to oAR (AR2) down and 
       set it up at nAR. The traffic can be still tunneled from the 
       aAR and the context can still stay at aAR until the MN decides 
       to change its CoA.

       3-The MN determines based on its traffic load, when to change 
       context anchor AR. Also by allowing MN to request context 
       transfer initiation, and hence provides more design flexibility 
       to accommodate various access technologies. 
        
       4-Since context transfer is done after the handover target is 
       determined, the need for proactive multi-target context 
       transfers is eliminated. 
        
       5-Context is delivered just in time, the chances for context 
       mis-synchronization and stale contexts are greatly reduced, 
       since the tunnel is torn down after transfer of dynamic feature 
       context such as header compression states (details in 5.2 and 
       5.3). 
  
 5.      Context transfer protocol considerations 
     
 5.1.   context transfer start  
     
 5.1.1. Context transfer starting trigger 
     
    Once the MN has acquired a new CoA from newAR, the newAR needs to 
    install the MN's context, in order to be able to start handling 
    MN's traffic. Hence, context transfer from anchor AR to new AR 
    needs to be complete before the bi-directional tunnel between old 
    AR and new AR is torn down. Although, this imposes a hard deadline 
    for context transfer completion, this proposal provides a great 
    deal of flexibility in choosing the timing of context transfer 
    trigger.  
     
    We can safely say, the context transfer trigger can created at any 
    time between the following two events (as long as the tunnel life-
    time allows for complete transfer of context data, otherwise 
    tunnel life-time must be extended) 
     
       1) MN starts signaling for new CoA acquisition. 
       2) New AR is ready to handle routing of MN's traffic (tunnel 
          must be torn down) 
     
    Below is a list several that events can be chosen as CT triggers: 
     
       -L2 indication to new AR about L2 connection between MN and 
       nAR. 
       -MN initiates new CoA acquisition (address auto-configuration 
       or registration message to HA). 
       -MN informs its aAR about its new CoA through a BU (BU in 
       Mobile IP is seen as an indication for old AR to start 
       forwarding MN's packets to new CoA through new AR. 
       -MN informs new AR about its new CoA by sending a neighbor 
       advertisement (NA). 
        
    Despite the flexibility in choosing triggers and messages. CT 
    request messaging can be piggybacked along with any of these

    messages or sent as a stand alone packet (our choice is the 
    latter). We choose a source AR initiated approach based on MN's 
    request as described below: 
     
    Once the MN has acquired a new CoA, it will send a registration 
    request (v4) or a binding update, BU, to CN (v6). MN can use this 
    event, as a trigger for sending context transfer request message 
    to aAR.  
        
 5.1.2. Context transfer starting element 
        
    Any of following approaches can be chosen to start context 
    transfer 
       -A source initiated context transfer (source trigger to old AR, 
       such as BU) 
       -A target initiated context transfer (target trigger to new AR, 
       such as NA) 
       -Simply have the MN to request a context transfer from new AR 
       or old AR. 
     
    We see that this framework provides a great amount of flexibility 
    in choosing the starting event and element. As mentioned earlier, 
    we choose to have MN send a context transfer request to old AR. 
  
 5.2.   Robustness considerations 
     
    In order to provide a robust transfer of context, a number of 
    factors should be taken into account. 
     
       -In case the network is capable of handling different QoS 
       profiles, the context transfer packets should be treated as 
       better than best effort traffic to add robustness to context 
       transfer procedure. 
     
       -Fragmentation of context data into multiple packets might be 
       necessary. Reasons for fragmentation might be: 
     
          1-Large amount of context data in relation to path MTU and 
          maximum segment size (MSS). 
          2-Different feature context data may have significantly 
          different life-times and the aAR-nAR round trip times (RTT) 
          may be prohibitively long. In this case, these feature 
          contexts might have to be sent in different packets to avoid 
          inconsistency of protocol states at protocol peers. 
          3-In case multiphase context transfer is deemed necessary 
          for some reason.  
    Note that, our context proposal does not require multiphase 
    context transfer. In case fragmentation is required, consecutive 
    context data packets are marked with ascending context data 
    sequence numbers. 
                  
       -In case, context transfer is performed at the same time as 
       real time traffic, prevailing flow of real time traffic will

       render the already transmitted header compression states 
       invalid. Hence, once the header compression states are 
       transmitted, either the tunnel should be torn down, or the 
       anchor AR must stop transmitting compressed packets to the MN 
       through the tunnel, i.e. the remainder of the traffic should be 
       transmitted in uncompressed format. 
  
       -Tunnel tear down message: As mentioned above, if possible, 
       once the header compression states are transferred, the tunnel 
       should be torn down to avoid state inconsistency. However, as 
       mentioned above, we suggest that after completion of context 
       transfer, aAR simply send uncompressed packets to nAR.  
  
       -CT abort message: In case the MN moves to a third AR, while 
       the context transfer signaling is in progress, the context 
       transfer should be aborted immediately of two reasons: 
          1-the context would no longer be needed at the second AR. 
          2-To avoid the confusion on what AR is the MN's current 
          context anchor AR. 
       The. details of this message are explained in section 6. 
  
 5.3.   Reliability considerations 
     
    This proposal is written at a time, when transport requirements 
    for context transfer procedure are not specified [5], and hence 
    the reliability mechanisms suggested here needs to be viewed 
    bearing that fact in mind. In case, the context transfer mechanism 
    has a need for reliability mechanisms, it is possible that an 
    existing transport protocol with some reliability provisioning 
    mechanisms such as retransmissions and ACKs is chosen for this 
    purpose. Of this reason, we avoid adding extensive inbuilt 
    reliability mechanisms in our CT protocol design. However, 
    regardless of the choice of transport and reliability mechanism, 
    it is important to note the following: 
     
         NOTE: The reliability mechanisms provided by transport layer 
         can provide retransmission of data. In case of context 
         transfer, certain feature contexts, such as header 
         compression states are highly dynamic. In case the 
         transmission of such contexts fails, it might be possible 
         that retransmission of the same feature context would lead to 
         inconsistency. In such cases, an update rather than a 
         retransmission is necessary. The underlying transport 
         mechanisms would only be able to handle retransmissions and 
         not updates. 
     
    It is not clear at this point, whether reliability is a necessity 
    for context transfer protocol. Hence, in this section, we provide 
    the following context transfer message flow with optional minimum 
    reliability mechanism. For instance, we do not provide mechanisms 
    that inform the new AR of a lost context transfer data message 
    from old AR. We predict and expect, that this portion of the

    protocol will undergo a redesign, once reliability requirements 
    for context transfer are specified. 
     
    Caveat:  
         The minimum reliability mechanism proposed here assumes that 
         the receivers of context transfer related messages are able 
         to intercept context transfer messages as such (without 
         damaged headers) and only provide reliability for transferred 
         feature context. The checksum mechanisms only protect the 
         context transfer peer ARs from minor corruptions of CT header 
         and payload.

 5.3.1. UDP Checksum activation 
    Of the existing transport mechanisms, both TCP and SCTP provide 
    checksums. Only UDP provides an optional checksum. Hence, instead 
    of adding a context transfer header checksum, we propose that the 
    UDP checksum MUST be activated, in case context transfer messages 
    are carried over UDP. Note: This mechanism would not provide 
    protection against individual feature context corruptions. 
     
 5.3.2. CT Header sequence number (optional) 
    In case, context transfer data is transmitted in multiple packets 
    or phases, this sequence number can be used to aid new AR in 
    ordering the packets and detecting lost packets (through observing 
    a gap in sequence numbers). 
    Retransmissions or updates of context data should use the same 
    sequence number. 
    Note: in case, context transfer data consists of a single packet, 
    the new AR will not be able to detect the loss of that packet, 

  
 Nakhjiri          Internet Draft - Expires May 2002                11

    unless MN informs new AR of the imminent context transfer (at the 
    same time as requesting context transfer from aAR). So one should 
    bear in mind, that we are only providing minimum reliability 
    mechanisms due to lack of reliability requirements at this point. 
     
 5.3.3. Update flag (U-flag) (optional) 
    The decision of retransmission or update of context data is based 
    on the value of this flag. This flag is transmitted along with the 
    context data packet and context transfer NACK message. If the flag 
    is set, it means prior to consequent transmissions of this context 
    data, the protocol unit for this feature must be consulted to 
    acquire updated context data. If the flag is cleared, the anchor 
    AR can simply retransmit this feature context from its buffers. 
     
 5.3.4.  Context transfer NACKs (optional)  
    In case the new AR, i.e. the CT peer, receiving context data has 
    determined that it has received an invalid packet or failed to 
    receive an expected packet (based observed gaps in sequence number 
    gaps), it will send a context transfer NACK to the anchor AR, i.e 
    the transmitting end.  
    In case, the NACK is for an entire lost or corrupted packet, only 
    the CT header with type 5 (for CT NACK) is sent without any 
    payload, including the expected sequence number. When the aAR 
    receives this CT NACK message (header only), based on the sequence 
    number, it needs to reconstruct the entire context data it had 
    sent earlier. This means some feature contexts needs to updated 
    consulting the feature unit. 
    In case the new AR needs an update for a specific feature context, 
    a CT NACK payload is constructed as shown in figure 7 along with 
    CT header. The value of Update flag is simply copied from the 
    context data packet to indicate whether a retransmission or an 
    update is required. 
     
 5.3.5. NACK timers (optional) 
     Implementing a NACK timer at the anchor AR has the same effect as 
    implementing ACK messages sent by newAR to anchor AR, but a NACK 
    timer saves network bandwidth otherwise wasted on 
    acknowledgements. NACK timer is generic for entire context data, 
    not specific features. 
     
    The length of NACK timers will depend on RTT, ability of context 
    transfer peers in processing the information and possibly 
    capability of protocol units related to the feature context. 
    Although updates will be sent with different sequence numbers, the 
    ability of the underlying transport protocol to detect 
    duplications in case of retransmissions is also another important 
    factor in choosing the NACK timer value. Hence considerations in 
    choosing length of NACK timer are TBD at this time. 
  
 5.4.   Security considerations: 
     
    The security considerations for this protocol are covered in 
    detail in 10.

 6.      Protocol messaging 
     
    In a tunneling approach for handover, the compressed traffic is 
    carried through the aAR-nAR bi-directional tunnel, using GRE. The 
    details of this procedure are being worked out in Mobile IP WG 
    [3], and since our main objective is to transfer context data, we 
    avoid going into the details of that procedure. 
     
    It is possible to piggyback context transfer data and signaling 
    over other traffic related to the MN. That means the context 
    transfer messages would also be sent through the bi-directional 
    tunnel. However, for simplicity, at this point, we suggest using 
    "un-tunneled" standalone packets for context transfer purpose. 
     
    In case the network is capable of handling different QoS profiles, 
    the context transfer packets should be treated as better than best 
    effort traffic to add robustness to context transfer procedure. 
     
    Figure 3 shows the proposed the format for context transfer 
    messages. 
     
    These messages are sent using "regular IP" packet format. Since 
    the reliability and transport layer mechanism for context transfer 
    is not specified yet, we suffice adding a "transport header" in 
    the message format below. The IP header and transport header is 
    then followed by a context transfer header. The context transfer 
    header needs to have a next header type number to be identified by 
    the transport layer.

 6.2.    Context transfer header 
     
    The context transfer header consists of the common information for 
    all the messages in context transfer protocol, i.e. both data and 
    signaling transfer messages and is as follows (exact field sizes 
    are TBD)

          P: Payload present. Some messages, such as cT request 
          message might not require CT payload, and only a CT header 
          is sufficient, while CT data message will include payload. 
     
       Length:  
          length of CT message payload. 
     
       Sequence Number (optional) 
          In case, context transfer data is transmitted in multiple 
          packets or phases, this sequence number can be used to aid 
          new AR in ordering the packets and detecting lost packets 
          (through observing a gap in sequence numbers). 
          Retransmissions or updates of context data should use the 
          same sequence number. 
          Note: in case, context transfer data consists of a single 
          packet, the new AR will not be able to detect the loss of 
          that packet. 
     
       MN's L2 address: 
          This field identifies the MN to the context transfer peers, 
          i.e. aAR and nAR. Although, aAR is able to recognize the MN 
          based on MN's old CoA or home IP address, newAR might only 

  
 Nakhjiri          Internet Draft - Expires May 2002                14 
 Internet Draft            Time Efficient CT              October 2001 



          be able to recognize MN's L2 address. Hence, We choose MN's 
          L2 address as a mean to identify the MN. 
  
 6.3.   Context profile types 
  
    As proposed in [6], we also recognize the need for a simple 
    representation that provides a generic structure, while allowing 
    each feature to define its own context parameters. We define a 
    Feature context Profile Type (FPT) to uniquely identify the type 
    of a feature context, such as a QoS Profile Type (QPT) for 
    Diffserv, or a Compression Profile Type (CPT). 
  
 7.      Message formats 
  
 7.1.   CT Request message (MN to aAR) 
  
    When MN desires a change of anchor AR, MN sends a context transfer 
    request message to aAR using the link to nAR. This message is sent 
    after new CoA acquisition, i.e. when MN is ready to send 
    registration or binding update messages. 
  
    This message is sent in uncompressed IP packet format with MN's IP 
    address as source address and aAR IP address as the destination 
    address. The MN's IP address is MN's home address in v4 without 
    route optimization and MN's aCoA in v6). Since this source and 
    destination address combination is unique, the IP header in this 
    message cannot be compressed. Note, the context transfer request 
    message is not a sent through the tunnel. 
     
    The message is constructed using context transfer header with the 
    header type  0 for CT request. No CT payload is necessary for this 
    message. This message is authenticated based on the authentication 
    provided in the ESP header.  
     
 7.2.    CT data message (aAR to newAR) 
  
    This message contains actual context data. This message is 
    transmitted in an standalone packet, which is constructed using 
    context transfer header with the header type 3 for CT data 
    message, and the CT payload shown in the following figure.

    Fields: 
     
       FPT     Feature context profile type:  
          Describes the type of feature context, being transferred in 
          the context data option, such as Header compression profile 
          type. The type numbers are TBD. 
     
       N flag: 
          If set, there would be a next feature context data option 
          present, indicating more context data to follow. 
          If cleared, this is the last feature context data option. 
     
       U-flag: Retransmit or update flag (optional) 
          Depending on the reliability needs of the context transfer 
          procedure and the reliability needs of the specific feature 
          being transferred the context data option, a U flag is set, 
          or cleared, to show, whether consequent transmissions of 
          this feature context should be updates or retransmissions. 
          This U flag is set/cleared for each context profile type 
          based on the determination of the protocol unit. If the flag 
          is set, it means prior to consequent transmissions of this 
          context data, the protocol unit for this feature must be 
          consulted to acquire updated context data. If the flag is 
          cleared, the anchor AR can simply retransmit this feature 
          context from its buffers. 
          The update messages would be marked with the same feature 
          context sequence numbers. 
     
       feature data length: 
          The length of feature context data for the specified 
          feature. 
        
       Feature context data sequence number 
          In case one feature context data is transmitted over several 
          datagrams. This sequence number is initiated at zero between 
          AR and nAR at the start of context transfer procedure.

          Depending on the reliability mechanisms, this sequence 
          number can be used in NACKs and retransmissions. For 
          instance, in case the new AR needs an update for a specific 
          feature context, a CT NACK payload is constructed as shown 
          in figure 7 along with CT header. The value of Update flag 
          is simply copied from the context data packet to indicate 
          whether a retransmission or an update is required. 
        
        Microflow identifier: 
          The definition of micro-flow for context transfer framework 
          is borrowed from RFC 2475, as explained in the context 
          transfer problem statement [4]. Hence the micro-flow is 
          identified by source and destination address, source and 
          destination port and protocol id. 
        
       Context data: 
          The actual feature protocol states 
  
 7.3.   Context transfer NACK message (from nAR to aAR) (optional) 
  
    The reliability and underlying transport protocol requirement for 
    CT are not specified at this point [5]. Hence, the combination of 
    CT NACK messages and U flag is provided as a minimum reliability 
    mechanisms built into the context transfer protocol. As mentioned 
    earlier, the context updates can not be provided by transport 
    protocols, so in case reliability for the transport of a specific 
    feature is needed in forms of updates, the U-flag is set in the 
    context data option for that feature.  
    In case the new AR, i.e. the CT peer, receiving context data has 
    determined that it has received an invalid packet or failed to 
    receive an expected packet (based observed gaps in sequence number 
    gaps), it will send a context transfer NACK to the anchor AR, i.e 
    the transmitting end.  
    In case, the NACK is for an entire lost or corrupted packet, only 
    the CT header with type 5 (for CT NACK) is sent without any 
    payload, including the expected sequence number. When the aAR 
    receives this CT NACK message (header only), based on the sequence 
    number, it needs to reconstruct the entire context data it had 
    sent earlier. This means some feature contexts needs to updated 
    consulting the feature unit. 
    In case the new AR needs an update for a specific feature context, 
    a CT NACK payload is constructed as shown in figure 7 along with 
    CT header. The value of Update flag is simply copied from the 
    context data packet to indicate whether a retransmission or an 
    update is required. The value of micro-flow identifier is simply 
    copied from the context data packet. The message is constructed 
    using context transfer header with the header type 5 for CT NACK 
    message and a payload as shown below:

    Note, as mentioned earlier, in case CT data consists of a single 
    packet and that packet is lost, the new AR has no way of knowing 
    about the context transfer in process. This is a trade off based 
    on minimum signaling requirement and uncertain transport 
    mechanisms at the time of this writing. 
  
 7.4.   CT abort message (nAR to aAR) 
  
    In case the MN moves to a third AR, while the context transfer 
    signaling (or context data transfer) is in progress, the context 
    transfer should be aborted immediately of two reasons: 
     
       1-the context would no longer be needed at the second AR. 
       2-To avoid the confusion on what AR is the MN's current context 
       anchor AR. 
     
    Hence, the context would still stay at anchor AR without a need 
    for context transfer, until a newCoA and AR for MN's traffic is 
    identified. 
     
    CT abort message can be send from nAR to aAR based on the L2 
    indication on deteriorating MN-nAR link conditions. This is more 
    preferable than having MN send a CT abort message to aAR. The 
    message is constructed using context transfer header with the 
    header type 6 for CT abort and no payload. 
  
 8.      Compliance with requirements for context transfer 
     
    In this section we will verify the compliance of the context 
    transfer solution proposed in this document with the requirements 
    for context transfer in [5]. The sections in the requirement 
    document [5] to which, we are verifying compliances are mentioned 
    in parantheses. 
  
 8.1.   Compliance with general requirements (section 4 of [5]) 
     
    Trigger Requirements (4.1-4): The MN sends a Context transfer 
    request to aAR in form of a standalone IP message. This message 
    can be seen as an explicit form of layer 3 trigger for context 
    transfer procedure.

    Separation of context transfer signaling and data (4.5): According 
    to our proposal, aAR starts the transfer of context data to nAR, 
    after a separate request by MN. This is a natural separation of 
    context transfer signaling and context data transfer. 
     
    Optional support of one-to-many context transfer (4.6): We propose 
    starting context transfer after L2 handover completion. This 
    removes the inter-dependency of context transfer on next AR 
    discovery procedure. 
     
    Timing of context transfer relative to handover (4.7): Our 
    proposal removes the context transfer out of the timing critical 
    path for handover and at the same time provides great amount of 
    flexibility in timing of the context transfer operation. 
     
    Distributed context transfer approach (4.8): Our proposal is based 
    on AR-AR context transfer. 
     
    Mutual authentication (4.9): Mutual authentication between aAR and 
    nAR is accomplished using IPsec ESP. 
     
    IP micro-flow as a unit (4.10): using context data options, 
    feature profile types and micro flow identifiers plus the fact 
    that context transfer is started by anchor AR, provide the means 
    to selectively able and disable context transfer for a particle 
    micro-flow. 
     
    Context availability at ARs (4.12): Having the oldAR to act as 
    anchor AR and context holding AR for MN, complies with this 
    requirement. This is also re-enforced by MN sends the context 
    request to the aAR. 
     
    Reliability of context (4.13): The details of a minimal 
    reliability procedure are provided in 5.3. This includes a clear 
    distinction between retransmissions and updates, which would not 
    be covered by a transport layer protocol. 
     
    Inter-working with IETF mobility solutions (4.14): The proposal is 
    highly aligned with the work being done in Mobile IP working group 
    [4]. 
     
 8.2.   Compliance with protocol requirements (section 5 of [5]) 
     
    Support for all feature types (5.1.1-5): This proposal supports 
    the usage of feature context profile type (also suggested in [6]), 
    which facilitates the move of various kinds of context and 
    identifying the type of these context data. Having the tunnel open 
    for traffic during context transfer also reduces the chances of 
    incomplete context transfer, before all the context is 
    transferred. 
  
    Transport requirements (5.2): Checksum fields and NACK messages 
    are provided as optional procedures to provide flexibility in

    choice of transport layer protocol and reliability mechanism even 
    before the transport requirements for context transfer are 
    identified 
     
    Security requirements (5.3.1-3): The security considerations are 
    explained in details in 5.4. Removing the ESP from the context 
    transfer simply achieve the goal of disabling security. 
  
    Minimum protocol exchanges (5.4.1): The protocol proposed is very 
    lightweight; after a request by the MN at a convenient time to 
    aAR, which holds the context, context is transferred to nAR. After 
    this request, aAR starts transferring the context data. Without 
    reliability procedures, the protocol only involves two messages. 
     
    Minimum processing at ARs (5.4.2): By holding the context at aAR 
    until the MN changes the new AR, the processing can continue at 
    aAR, which minimizes the need for processing at new AR. It also 
    minimizes the effects of ping-ponging and fast moves to third ARs. 
     
    Timing constraints for feature types (5.4.3): Using the tunnel to 
    forward MNÆs traffic and giving the MN the flexibility in choosing 
    the timing of context transfer, as well as the update flag, and 
    sending dynamic context data (such as header compression) at the 
    end, provides means of meeting time constraints for various 
    feature types. 
     
    Context aggregation (5.4.4-5): Using context data options, feature 
    profile types and micro flow identifiers facilitate the 
    aggregation of multiple context data in a natural way. 
     
    Context synchronization (5.5): By provisioning means for sending 
    updates for specific contexts, as well as sending uncompressed 
    packets after completion of header compression context, the 
    synchronization requirements are met. 
     
    Inter-working with handover mechanisms (5.6): This proposal is 
    closely tied to the handover mechanisms currently being proposed 
    in Mobile IP WG [3], the context transfer request message is 
    chosen based on the handover events. A list of other possible 
    context transfer trigger (all based on Mobile IP handover 
    mechanisms) is provided in 5.1. 
     
 9.      IANA considerations 
     
    Since, CT header follows a known transport header, a next header 
    type for the context transfer header needs to be identified by 
    IANA. This number would be inserted in "next header" field of the 
    transport layer. 
  
 10.    Security Considerations 
  
    Our proposal assumes that prior to tunnel establishment between 
    the peer ARs (for traffic forwarding), these ARs are authenticated 

  
 Nakhjiri          Internet Draft - Expires May 2002                20 
 Internet Draft            Time Efficient CT              October 2001 



    to each other. It would be straight forward to say that the 
    context transfer protocol simply uses the same authentication 
    procedures and SAs in order to authenticate the context transfer 
    data message (and CT NACK and CT updates, if applied) between old 
    AR and new AR. This is aligned with [5] that the context transfer 
    peer ARs Must be mutually authenticated to each other, and share 
    appropriate security associations.  
     
    However, context transfer data might include keying material that 
    needs to be encrypted. For this reason, we suggest that IPsec ESP 
    should be used for protecting context transfer data message (as 
    shown in 4.3). ESP should be used in transport mode, since aAR and 
    nAR context transfer can be considered as an end to end 
    communications, even when aAR and nAR each are acting as security 
    gateways for their own networks (traffic destined to a SG can be 
    protected in transport mode [7]). ESP can also be used for 
    authentication of the CT data message. ESP related SA s must exist 
    between aAR and nAR prior to context transfer signaling. These SA 
    s can either exist permanently or can be established while the 
    tunnel between the peer ARs is being setup to not add extra 
    signaling delay). Our recommendation is that these SA s should be 
    of coarse type, i.e. on per host pair basis, rather than on 
    context transfer session, or MN basis and should exist permanently 
    between the two AR s. 
     
    In case encryption needs to be disabled, ESP can be used in NULL 
    encryption mode, while authentication is still on. If neither 
    authentication nor encryption is desired, the ESP header needs to 
    be removed completely (or alternatively, one can have a "bypass" 
    grade for the corresponding SA in security policy database, SPD). 
  
    The CT request message sent by MN to aAR, can be authenticated 
    using the already existing security association between MN and 
    aAR. 
     
    It is not our intention to discussion the procedure of 
    authentication of MN to nAR, since it is out of the scope of 
    context transfer security provisioning. We will rely on the 
    existing MN's L2 authentication mechanisms to new AP/ AR, until MN 
    is ready for L3 registration and authentication.
