Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB),
   the Mobile-IPv6 MIB , for use with network management protocols
   in the Internet community. In particular, the Mobile-IPv6 MIB will be
   used to monitor and control the mobile node, home agent and
   correspondent node functions of a Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) entity.

1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


2.  Overview

2.1 The Mobile IPv6 Protocol entities.

   Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) [RFC3775] specifies a protocol which allows nodes
   to remain reachable while moving around in the IPv6 Internet. An
   entity which implements the MIPv6 protocol is a MIPv6 entity. There
   are three types of entities envisaged by the MIPv6 protocol.

      mobile node (MN): A node that can change its point of attachment
      from one link to another, while still being reachable via its home
      address.

      correspondent node (CN): A peer node with which a mobile node is
      communicating. The correspondent node may be either mobile or
      stationary. [Note that a correspondent node does not necessarily
      require MIPv6 support.]

      home agent (HA): A router on a mobile node's home link with which
      the mobile node has registered its current care-of address. While
      the mobile node is away from home, the home agent intercepts
      packets on the home link destined to the mobile node's home
      address, encapsulates them, and routes them to the mobile node's
      registered care-of address.

   This document defines a set of managed objects (MOs) that can be used
   to monitor and control MIPv6 entities.

2.2 Terminology.
   The terminology used in this document is consistent with the
   definitions used in Mobile IPv6 protocol specification[RFC3775].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Mobile IPv6 Monitoring and Control Requirements

   For managing a MIPv6 entity it is necessary to monitor
   the following:
       o capabilities of MIPv6 entities
       o traffic due to MIPv6
       o binding related statistics (at home agent, correspondent
         node and mobile node)
       o binding details (at home agent and correspondent node)
       o history of Binding Updates (at home agent, correspondent
         node and mobile node)

   The MIPv6 protocol document stipulates that several MIPv6 related
   parameters should be manually configurable. The MIPv6 MIB should
   define managed objects that can be used to configure the related
   parameters e.g.:
       o the preference value the home agent will use in Router
         Advertisements;
       o the lifetime value the home agent will use in Router
         Advertisements;
       o whether a home agent will send ICMP Mobile Prefix
         Advertisements to mobile nodes;
       o whether a home agent will respond to ICMP Mobile Prefix
         Solicitation messages from mobile nodes; and
       o whether a home agent will process multicast group membership
         control messages from mobile nodes.

4.  MIB Design.

   The basic principle has been to keep the MIB as simple as possible
   and at the same time to make it effective enough so that the
   essential needs of monitoring and control are met. It is envisaged
   that wherever possible existing MIBS will be used (e.g. IPSec MIB,
   Neighbor Discovery MIB, Tunnel MIB.) for monitor and control of MIPv6
   entities.

   It is assumed that the Mobile IPv6 Management Information Base
   (MOBILEIPV6-MIB) will always be implemented in conjunction with the
   IPv6-capable version of the IP-MIB [RFC2011bis]. The MOBILEIPV6-MIB
   uses the textual conventions defined in the INET-ADDRESS-MIB
   [RFC3291bis].

   The Mobile-IPv6 MIB comprises of following groups of definitions:
       - mip6Core: a generic group containing objects that are
         common to all the Mobile IPv6 entities.
       - mip6Ha: this group models the home agent service. It
         comprises of objects specific to the services and associated
         advertisement parameters offered by the home agent on each
         of its links. It also contains objects pertaining to the
         maintenance of the home agent list on each of the links on
         which the service is offered.
       - mip6Mn: this group models the mobile node service. It
         comprises of objects specific to the Dynamic Home Agent
         discovery function and related parameters. It also contains
         objects that record the movement of the mobile node.
       - mip6Cn: models the correspondent node and is primarily
         scoped to its participation in the Return Routability
         procedure for achieving Route Optimization triggered by
         the mobile node.
       - mip6Notifications: defines the set of notifications that
         will be used to asynchronously monitor the Mobile IPv6
         entities.

   The tables contained in the above groups are as follows-
       mip6BindingCacheTable   : models the binding cache on the home
                                 agent and correspondent node. It
                                 contains details of the Binding Update
                                 requests that have been received and
                                 accepted.
       mip6BindingHistoryTable : tracks the history of the binding
                                 cache.
       mip6NodeTrafficTable    : the mobile node-wise traffic counters.
       mip6MnHomeAddressTable  : contains all the home addresses
                                 pertaining to the mobile node and
                                 the corresponding registration status.

       mip6MnBLTable           : models the Binding Update List on the
                                 mobile node. It contains information
                                 about the registration requests sent
                                 by the mobile node and the
                                 corresponding results.
       mip6CnCounterTable      : contains the mobile node-wise
                                 registration statistics.
       mip6HaConfTable         : contains the configurable
                                 advertisement parameters for all the
                                 interfaces on which the home agent
                                 service is advertised.
       mip6HaCounterTable      : contains registration statistics
                                 for all mobile nodes registered
                                 with the home agent.
       mip6HaListTable         : contains the list of all routers
                                 that are acting as home agents on
                                 each of the interfaces on which
                                 the home agent service is offered
                                 by this router.
       mip6HaGlAddrTable       : contains the global addresses of
                                 the home agents.

6.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.  These
   are the tables and objects and the corresponding
   sensitivity/vulnerability:
        mip6Status:  The value of this object is used to enable or
                     disable the MIPv6 functionality on a MIPv6 entity.
                     Access to this MO may be abused to disrupt the
                     MIPv6 communication.
        mip6HaAdvPreference: Access to this object may be abused to
                     force MNs into selecting the wrong HA.
        mip6HaAdvLifetime: Access to this object may be abused to set
                     the advertised lifetime to incorrect values. That
                     will have an adverse impact on the MIPv6
                     communication.
        mip6BindingAdminStatus: The value of this object is used to
                     control the status of a binding cache entry.
                     Access to this object may be abused to deny mobile
                     IPv6 connectivity to a legitimate user or, to
                     grant Mobile IPv6 connectivity to an illegal user.
        mip6HaPrefixAdv: The value of this object indicates whether
                     the home agent will send ICMP Mobile Prefix
                     Advertisements to the mobile node.
                     Access to this object may be abused to send
                     unwanted/wrong prefix information or to deny the
                     mobile node from receiving information about the
                     changes in the home prefixes.
                     This may result in disruption of the Mobile IPv6
                     connectivity.
        mip6HaPrefixSolicitation: The value of this object indicates
                     whether the home agent should respond to ICMP
                     Mobile Prefix Solicitation messages from a mobile
                     node. Access to this object may be abused to deny
                     the mobile node information about its home prefix.
                     This may result in disruption of the Mobile IPv6
                     connectivity.
        mip6HaMCastCtlMsgSupport: The value of this object decides
                     whether the home agent should process the
                     multicast group membership control messages it
                     receives from mobile nodes. Access to this object
                     maybe used to subvert administrate policy on
                     multicasting, or to disrupt the multicast
                     communication with the mobile node.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

    The address related objects in this MIB may be considered to be
    particularly sensitive and/or private.  The care-of address related
    objects reveal the location and movement of the mobile node. This
    information may be considered to be private and sensitive and must
    be carefully handled.
        mip6BindingHstCOAType
        mip6BindingHstCOA
        mip6MnBLCOAType
        mip6MnBLCOA

    The mobile node's home address and home agent related information
    may be considered to be sensitive too as these may provide clues to
    a malicious party on ways to disrupt the mobile nodes communication
    channels.
        mip6BindingHstHomeAddressType,
        mip6BindingHstHomeAddress,
        mip6MnHomeAddressType,
        mip6MnHomeAddress

    The correspondent node's addresses related MOs will reveal the nodes
    with whom the mobile node is corresponding. This information may be
    considered private and sensitive.
        mip6MnBLNodeAddressType,
        mip6MnBLNodeAddress


   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator

   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA should assign a base arc in the 'mib-2' (standards track) OID
   tree for the 'mip6MIB' MODULE-IDENTITY defined in the Mobile-IPv6
   MIB.

           ::= { mip6MnBLEntry 12 }

   i. Fixed SYNTAX of mip6MnBLMaxSeq           to Unsigned32 (0..65536)
   j. Added REFERENCE for
      mip6CnBUsAccepted             "RFC3775 : Section 9.5.1, 9.5.4"
   k. Added the counter discontinuity clause in the DESCRIPTION of
      mip6HaAdvsRecd:
                    Discontinuities in the value of this counter can
                    occur at re-initialization of the management system,
                    and at other times as indicated by the value of
                    mip6CounterDiscontinuityTime.
   l. Fixed REFERENCE of mip6HaAdvsRecd   "RFC3775 : Section 7"
   m. Added text in DESCRIPTION about the read-write objects in
      mip6HaConfTable
                   It is RECOMMENDED that the last written values
                   of the objects in the conceptual rows of this
                   table will remain unchanged across reboots of
                   the managed entity provided that, the interfaces
                   have not been renumbered after the reboot.
   n. Added text in DESCRIPTION about behaviour of
      mip6HaPrefixAdv
                    The state can be changed from enabled(1) to
                    disabled(2) and vice versa by operator
                    intervention.
                    Causing the state to change from enabled(1) to
                    disabled(2) will result in the home agent
                    disabling the Prefix advertisement function.
                    On the other hand, changing the status from
                    disabled(2) to enabled(1) will start the prefix
                    advertisement funtion.
   o. Added text in DESCRIPTION of
      mip6HaGlAddrEntry
                   There is no upper-bound on the maximum number of
                   global addresses on an interface but, for practical
                   purposes the upper-bound of the value
                   mip6HaGaAddrSeqNo is set to 1024.
   p. Changed the MO name from mip6MnMoved to mip6MnCOAChanged
   q. Added REFERENCE to the Notification Object
      mip6MnRegistered
      mip6MnCOAChanged
      mip6MnBindingExpiredAtHA

   r. Clarified the DESCRIPTION of the Notification
      mip6MnRegistered
      mip6MnCOAChanged
      mip6MnBindingExpiredAtHA
                   This notification is sent by a home agent when
                   a mobile node registers with the home agent

Internet Draft                                             March 7, 2005


                   for the first time.
   s. Fixed the DESCRIPTIONS of the compliances objects for the
      INDEX objects that cannot be represented in the form of
      OBJECT clauses in SMIv2,

   t. Editorial nits



   Changes since draft-ietf-mip6-mipv6-mib-04,txt
   a. Fixed the InetAddress/InetAddressType usage. Now there
      is provision for supporting protocols other than IPv6.
      - the statements constraining the InetAddressType ot
        ipv6(2) and ipv6z(4) have been removed from the
        DESCRIPTION clauses of the InetAddressType type MOs.
      - the statements constraining the InetAddress to a size
        of 16 and 20 octets have been removed from the
        DESCRIPTION clauses of the corresponding InetAddress
        type MOs.
      - the DESCRIPTION clauses of conceptual rows that have
        InetAddress type MOs as index have been revised to
        contain a note like-
          Implementors need to be aware that if the total
          number of octets in InetAddress type index MOs
          (e.g. mip6BindingHomeAddress) exceeds 113 then OIDs
          of column instances in this row will have more than
          128 sub-identifiers and cannot be accessed using
          SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, or SNMPv3.
      - fixed the DESCRIPTION of mip6BindingCOA.
          deleted the statement - A mobile node can have
          multiple care-of addresses. It is correct but not
          relevant in the context of the mip6BindingCacheEntry.
          There will be only one mip6BindingCOA for a
          mip6BindingHomeAddress.
      - editorial nits
   b. Nits fixed in References Section
      - included citation tag for IP-MIB [RFC2011bis]
      - included citation tag for INET-ADDRESS-MIB [RFC3291bis]
      - added RFC2119 to the references list
      - added RFC3291bis to the references list
      - changed citation tag from [MIPv6] to [RFC3775]
      - fixed the "Normative References" and "Informative References"
        section tags.

   c. Added OBJECT clause for mip6BindingAdminStatus that specifies
      a MIN-ACCESS of read-only for mip6HaReadOnlyCompliance3

   d. Fixed editorial nits

                  mip6MnBLNodeAddress
                }
   j. SIZE constraints for InetAddress objects used indices have
      been removed. Instead, appropriate constraints are specified
