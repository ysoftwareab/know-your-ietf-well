1.  Introduction

   The CONNECT-UDP [CONNECT-UDP] method allows proxying UDP packets over
   HTTP.  This document describes an extension to CONNECT-UDP that
   allows conveying ECN [ECN] information on proxied UDP packets.

   Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on the MASQUE IETF
   mailing list (masque@ietf.org (mailto:masque@ietf.org)) or on the
   GitHub repository which contains the draft:
   https://github.com/DavidSchinazi/draft-connect-udp-ecn.

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

Internet-Draft          CONNECT-UDP ECN Extension           January 2021


2.  ECN Header Definition

   "ECN" is a Item Structured Header [STRUCT-HDR].  Its value MUST be a
   Boolean.  Its ABNF is:

     ECN = sf-boolean

   The "ECN" header indicates whether the sender supports this
   extension.  A value of 1 indicates support whereas a value of 0 (or
   the absence of the header) indicates lack of support.

   Clients MUST NOT indicate support for this extension unless they know
   that the protocol running over UDP that is being proxied supports
   ECN, and will react appropriately to Congestion Experienced (CE)
   markings.

   Proxies MUST NOT indicate support for this extension unless they know
   they have the ability to read and write the IP ECN bits on its
   target-bound UDP sockets.

   This extension is said to have been negotiated when both client and
   proxy indicated support for it in their CONNECT-UDP request and
   response.

3.  Datagram Encoding of Proxied UDP Packets

   If a client supports this extension and HTTP/3 datagrams [H3DGRAM],
   it can attempt to use datagrams for ECN information.  This is done by
   allocating four datagram flow identifiers (as opposed to one in
   traditional CONNECT-UDP) and communicating them to the proxy using
   named elements on the "Datagram-Flow-Id" header.  These names are
   "ecn-ect0", "ecn-ect1", and "ecn-ce".  For example:

     Datagram-Flow-Id = 42, 44; ecn-ect0, 46; ecn-ect1, 48; ecn-ce

   If the proxy wishes to support datagram encoding of this extension,
   it echoes those named elements in its CONNECT-UDP response.  The
   unnamed element now represents Not-ECT, whereas the one in "ecn-ect0"
   represents ECT(0), "ecn-ect1" represents ECT(1) and "ecn-ce"
   represents CE; see Section 5 of [ECN] for the definition of these IP
   header fields.

   When the proxy receives a datagram from the given flow identifier, it
   sets the IP packet's ECN bits accordingly on the UDP packet it sends
   to the target.  Similarly, in the other direction the flow identifier
   represents which ECN bits were seen on the UDP packets received from
   the target.

4.  Stream Encoding of Proxied UDP Packets

   If HTTP/3 datagrams are not supported, the stream is used to convey
   UDP payloads, and the CONNECT-UDP Stream Chunk Type is used to
   indicate the values of the ECN bits, as defined below:

     +-------+-----------------+-----------+
     | Value |      Type       | ECN Field |
     +-------+-----------------+-----------+
     | 0x00  | UDP_PACKET      |  Not-ECT  |
     +-------+-----------------+-----------+
     | 0x31  | UDP_PACKET_ECT0 |  ECT(0)   |
     +-------+-----------------+-----------+
     | 0x32  | UDP_PACKET_ECT1 |  ECT(1)   |
     +-------+-----------------+-----------+
     | 0x33  | UDP_PACKET_CE   |  CE       |
     +-------+-----------------+-----------+

   The proxy then uses the the CONNECT-UDP Stream Chunk Type on received
   UDP payloads to set the ECN bits on the IP packets it sends to the
   target, and in the reverse direction to indicate which ECN bits
   received from the target.

5.  HTTP Intermediaries

   HTTP/3 DATAGRAM flow identifiers are specific to a given HTTP/3
   connection.  However, in some cases, an HTTP request may travel
   across multiple HTTP connections if there are HTTP intermediaries
   involved; see Section 2.3 of [RFC7230].

   Intermediaries that support this extension and HTTP/3 datagrams MUST
   negotiate all four flow identifiers separately on the client-facing
   and server-facing connections.  This is accomplished by having the
   intermediary parse the unnamed element and the "ecn-ect0", "ecn-
   ect1", and "ecn-ce" named elements in the "Datagram-Flow-Id" header
   on all CONNECT-UDP requests it receives, and sending the same four
   flow identifiers in the "Datagram-Flow-Id" header on the response.

   Intermediaries MUST NOT send the "ECN" header with a value of 1 to
   the client on its response unless it has received that same value in
   the response it received from the server.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not have additional security considerations beyond
   those defined in [CONNECT-UDP].

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  HTTP Header

   This document will request IANA to register the "ECN" header in the
   "Permanent Message Header Field Names" registry maintained at
   <https://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers>.

     +-------------------+----------+--------+---------------+
     | Header Field Name | Protocol | Status |   Reference   |
     +-------------------+----------+--------+---------------+
     |        ECN        |   http   |  std   | This document |
     +-------------------+----------+--------+---------------+

7.2.  Flow Identifier Parameters

   This document will request IANA to register the "ecn-ect0", "ecn-
   ect1", and "ecn-ce" flow identifier parameters in the "HTTP Datagram
   Flow Identifier Parameters" registry (see [H3DGRAM]):

     +----------+-------------------------+---------+---------------+
     |   Key    |       Description       | Is Name |   Reference   |
     +----------+-------------------------+---------+---------------+
     | ecn-ect0 | UDP payload with ECT(0) |   Yes   | This document |
     +----------+-------------------------+---------+---------------+
     | ecn-ect1 | UDP payload with ECT(1) |   Yes   | This document |
     +----------+-------------------------+---------+---------------+
     | ecn-ce   | UDP payload with CE     |   Yes   | This document |
     +----------+-------------------------+---------+---------------+

7.3.  Stream Chunk Type Registration

   This document will request IANA to register the following entry in
   the "CONNECT-UDP Stream Chunk Type" registry [CONNECT-UDP]:

   +-------+-----------------+-------------------------+---------------+
   | Value |      Type       |       Description       |   Reference   |
   +-------+-----------------+-------------------------+---------------+
   | 0x31  | UDP_PACKET_ECT0 | UDP payload with ECT(0) | This document |
   +-------+-----------------+-------------------------+---------------+
   | 0x32  | UDP_PACKET_ECT1 | UDP payload with ECT(1) | This document |
   +-------+-----------------+-------------------------+---------------+
   | 0x33  | UDP_PACKET_CE   | UDP payload with CE     | This document |
   +-------+-----------------+-------------------------+---------------+
