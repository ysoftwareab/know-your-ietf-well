1. Introduction 
 
   The Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES), the 
   requirements have been defined in RFC3654, and the framework in 
   RFC3746. The ForCES protocol, which standardizes the interface 
   between Control Element (CE) and Forwarding Element (FE), is being 
   defined in [ForCES-PL] by IETF.  
    
   Variant transport media (like IP, ATM, Ethernet, etc) may be applied 
   to ForCES protocol for the interconnection between CE and FE. To make 
   the ForCES protocol specification independent of these variant 
   transport means, a Transport Mapping Layer (TML) is induced in the 
   ForCES protocol. It is expected that different TML specifications be 
   individually defined in IETF. A set of service primitives is being 
   defined to provide standard interconnection between the ForCES 
   Protocol Layer(PL) and the TML [TML-SP]. 
    
   This document defines a TCP and UDP based ForCES Transport Mapping 
   Layer (TML) over IP networks. It applies TCP and UDP protocols as the 
   transport protocol for the ForCES protocol messages. Detailed 
   specifications are presented in this document for this TML to meet 
   the ForCES TML requirements. The specification also meets the 
   requirements of PL-TML service primitives defined in [TML-SP]

2. Definitions 
    
   Many definitions related to ForCES can be found in RFC3654, RFC3746 
   and the ForCES protocol [ForCES-PL], like: 
    
   ForCES Protocol Layer (ForCES PL) -- A layer in ForCES protocol 
   architecture that defines the ForCES protocol messages, the protocol 
   state transfer scheme, as well as the ForCES protocol architecture 
   itself (including requirements of ForCES TML (see below). 
   Specifications of ForCES PL are defined by [ForCES-PL]. 
    
   ForCES Protocol Transport Mapping Layer (ForCES TML) -- A layer in 
   ForCES protocol architecture that uses the capabilities of existing 
   transport protocols to specifically address protocol message 
   transportation issues, such as how the protocol messages are mapped 
   to different transport media (like TCP, IP, ATM, Ethernet, etc), and 
   how to achieve and implement reliability, multicast, ordering, etc. 
   The ForCES TML specifications are detailed in separate ForCES 
   documents, one for each TML. 
     
   This document defines the following notions: 
    
   ForCES TML over IP networks -- TML for ForCES protocol that are 
   applied to CE-FE interconnect networks, which run IP protocol at the 
   Network Layer. 
    
   IP TML -- Specifically means ForCES TML over IP networks in this 
   document, it uses TCP and UDP as the transport protocols.  
    
   Connection Manager Component (CMC) -- a component in IP TML that is 
   responsible for all IP TML level connection management. 
    
   Arbiter Component (AC) -- a component in IP TML that is responsible 
   for putting PL messages into IP TML level connections. 
    
3. ForCES TML Overview 
    
3.1. TML in ForCES Framework 
    
   The ForCES protocol[ForCES-PL] has defined the relationship between 
   ForCE PL and TML in the protocol framework, as shown in Figure 1. CE 
   and FE form a peer-to-peer structure in the framework, where CE PL 
   peers to FE PL and CE TML peers to FE TML. A TML always lies below a 
   PL in the same ForCES NE and provides services to the PL. Interface 
   between PL and TML is standardized by means of a set of service 
   primitives[TML-SP].

              Figure 1. The TML in the ForCES Protocol Framework 
     
   During ForCES pre-association phase, a CE/FE TML is usually managed 
   by CE Manager(CEM)/FE Manager(FEM), as shown in Figure 2, so as to be 
   pre-configured with some initialization parameters, like parameters 
   of TML connections.

   Note that although Figure 2 shows CEM/FEM being entities outside 
   CE/FE, it is also possible CEM/FEM are physically embedded in CE/FE. 
    
   During ForCES post-association phase, ForCES PL is activated. TML is 
   then associated to the local PL. From ForCES model point of view, to 
   associate a CE/FE TML to the CE/FE PL is actually to associate the 
   CE/FE TML to the CE/FE protocol entities in the CE/FE. In FE, the 
   protocol entity is the FE protocol LFB. Note that at the same time, 
   TMLs will have to still be associated to CEM/FEM. (This actually 
   infers that CEM/FEM will still be active during the post-association

              Figure 3. TML during ForCES post-association phase  
    
   Figure 3 also indicates that: 
    
   1. TML properties (attributes, capabilities, events, etc) appearing 
      at the PL level are actually part of the properties of CE/FE 
      Protocol entities. 
   2. PL-TML Service Primitives are used by cores of CE/FE Protocol 
      entities to access the TML properties as well as to send/receive 
      PL messages via TML. 
    
   From Figure 3, we also see that, TML receives configurations from 
   both PL layer and CEM/FEM during the post-association phase. It is 
   important to recognize the difference of the two types of management. 
   CEM/FEM management for TML at post-association phase is a consistent 
   management from pre-association phase, which is mainly for TML 
   connection management, while PL level management for TML is for the 
   management that is independent of actual TML medias and only based on 
   the uniformly defined service primitives. 
    
3.2. TML Requirements 
 
W. M. Wang               Expires Sept., 2006                 [Page 5] 
Internet Draft              ForCES TML over IP            Mar. 2006 
 
 
    
   The ForCES protocol[ForCES-PL] has defined the general requirements 
   to all types of  ForCES TMLs, as below: 
       
   1. Reliability 
   As defined by RFC 3654, section 6 #6. 
    
   2. Security 
   TML provides security services to the ForCES PL. TML layer should 
   support the following security services and describe how they are 
   achieved. 
    
          *  Endpoint authentication of FE and CE. 
    
          *  Message Authentication 
    
          *  Confidentiality service 
    
   3. Congestion Control 
   The congestion control scheme used needs to be defined. The 
   congestion control mechanism defined by the TML should prevent the FE 
   from being overloaded by the CE or the CE from being overwhelmed by 
   traffic from the FE.  Additionally, the circumstances under which 
   notification is sent to the PL to notify it of congestion must be 
   defined. 
    
   4.Uni/multi/broadcast addressing/delivery if any 
   If there is any mapping between PL and TML level Uni/Multi/Broadcast 
   addressing it needs to be defined. 
    
   5. HA decisions 
   It is expected that availability of transport links is the TML's 
   responsibility.  However, on config basis, the PL layer may wish to 
   participate in link failover schemes and therefore the TML must 
   support this capability. 
    
   6. Encapsulations used. 
   Different types of TMLs will encapsulate the PL messages on 
   different types of headers. The TML needs to specify the 
   encapsulation used. 
    
   7. Prioritization 
   It is expected that the TML will be able to handle up to 8 priority 
   levels needed by the PL layer and will provide preferential treatment. 
   TML needs to define how this is achieved. The requirement for 
   supporting up to 8 priority levels does not mean that the underlying 
   TML MUST be capable of handling up to 8 priority levels.  In such an 
   event the priority levels should be divided between the available TML 
   priority levels.  For example, if the TML only supports 2 priority

   levels, the 0-3 could go in one TML priority level, while 4-7 could 
   go in the other. 
    
   8. Protection against DoS attacks 
   As described in the Requirements RFC 3654, section 6 
    
3.3. PL-TML Service Primitives 
    
   PL-TML service primitives are standard interface between PL and TML 
   for the information exchanges. Six service primitives are defined, as: 
        TMLopen() 
        TMLclose() 
        TMLconfig() 
        TMLquery() 
        TMLsend() 
        TMLreceive() 
    
   The TML service primitives and the TML property definitions are 
   presented in [TML-SP]  
    
4. IP TML Framework 
    
   We define the architectural framework of a TCP and UDP based ForCES 
   TML over IP networks(IP TML) as in Figure 4. Note that this framework 
   applies to both CE TML and FE TML over IP networks.

                        Figure 4. Framework of IP TML 
    
   IP TML as showed in Figure 4 uses a ”TCP-UDP pair connection?for 
   interconnection between CE TMLs and FE TMLs. A TCP-UDP pair 
   connection contains a TCP connection and a UDP connection, which MUST 
   have the same source and destination IP addresses and port numbers.  
    
   We define that IP TML connections should always be established in 
   the form of TCP-UDP pair connection format, i.e., whenever a TCP 
   connection is established, a UDP connection with the same source and 
   destination addresses should also be available for the IP TML.  
    
   Note that, a UDP in a TCP-UDP pair is capable of multicast when it 
   gets support from IP multicast protocols.  
    
   The TCP-UDP pair connections are managed by a component 
   called ”Connection Manager Component (CMC)? The CMC is responsible 
   to all TML connections for the establishment and release, security of 
   the connections, HA management (at only the TML connection level).  
   Usually CMC fulfills these tasks by receiving configuration 
   information from CE/FE Managers as described in Figure 2 and Figure 3. 
   CMC also receives configuration information from local PL layer by 
   the PL running TMLConfigure service primitives.  
    
   Section 4.1 describes in details the CMC component.  
                                              
   This IP TML framework also defines that interfaces between PL and 
   TML should comply with the uniformly defined PL-TML service 
   primitives [TML-SP]. 
    
   When PL messages are generated by PL layer, they are sent to TML 
   layer by the TMLsend service primitives. IP TML receives the PL 
   messages and put the messages into two separate message queues 
   according to the types of the PL messages. PL messages with ’Redirect 
   Message?type are put in a redirect message queue, while all other

Internet Draft              ForCES TML over IP            Mar. 2006 
 
 
   messages that are called control messages are put in a control 
   message queue.  
    
   PL messages are then put into TML level connections via a component 
   called “Arbiter Component (AC)? The AC decides when and to which TML 
   connections a PL message in the two queues should be injected into. 
   Usually IP TML uses TCP/UDP socket interfaces to put the messages in 
   the IP TML connections.  
    
   The AC also receives PL messages from peer TML via the TML 
   connections, and makes them ready for local PL layer to fetch by the 
   PL using TMLReceive service primitives.  
    
   The AC may also generate TML events according to the TML connection 
   state and notifies local PL layer of the events. The TML events 
   should comply with the TML event specifications defined in the PL-TML 
   service primitives [TML-SP].  
    
   The AC has to receive configuration information from PL layer via 
   TMLconfigure service primitive.  
    
   The AC will also share information about TML connections with CMC. 
   The TML Connection Table in the CMC can also be accessed by AC. AC 
   will then use the table to arbitrate PL messages and to put them in 
   TML connections. 
    
   PL messages are encapsulated to TCP/UDP packets in AC before they 
   are put in IP TML connections. PL messages are decapsulated in AC 
   when received and before being output to PL.  
    
   Section 4.2 describes in details the AC component. 
    
4.1.Connection Manager Component (CMC) 
    
   The Connection Manager Component (CMC) receives configuration 
   information from CE manager (if it is a CE TML) or FE manager (if a 
   FE TML), as well as from local PL layer.  
    
   There is only one kind of TML connections defined in this IP TML: 
   TCP-UDP pair connection(s). A recommendation for the assignment of 
   the TCP-UDP pairs is as below: 
    
   1. A base TCP-UDP pair connection between every CE and every FE MUST 
      be applied. 
   2. Multiple TCP-UDP pair connections between one same CE and one 
      same FE MAY be applied for the sake of requirements like 
      prioritization. 
   3. PL control messages always use TCP in the TCP-UDP pair 
      connection(s) for transportaion.

Internet Draft              ForCES TML over IP            Mar. 2006 
 
 
   4. PL redirect messages always use UDP in the TCP-UDP pair 
      connection(s) for transportation. 
    
   The following steps are adopted to establish a TCP-UDP pair 
   connection between a CE and a FE: 
   1. CMC in a CE acts as a server  and waiting for a TCP connection 
      from FEs 
   2. CMC in a FE acts as a client, and it should have got information 
      from the FE manager for connecting to peer CE TML, which usually 
      include the IP address and the port number for the CE TML. 
   3. CMC in the FE makes a TCP connection to the CE TML.  
   4. A UDP connection with the same source and destination addresses 
      is then simultaneously and implicitly established. 
    
   CMC maintains a table called ”TML Connection Table? This table 
   contains information about all TCP-UDP pair connections that have 
   been established. For every TCP-UDP pair connection, the table 
   usually contains the following information:  
    
   . Connection destination CE/FE ID  
   . Connection destination IP address and port number 
     PL Message type(s) the connection applies for 
   . PL Message priority(s) the connection applies for 
    
   The TML connections establishment process usually happens when TML 
   receives TMLopen service primitives from local PL. When a new FE is 
   up and is going to associate itself to a CE, the FE PL usually needs 
   to open the TML first, then to send a FE Association Message to join.  
    
   All active TML connections will be closed and shutdown if a TMLclose 
   service primitive is received from local PL by a TML. When a FE is 
   going to leave an CE, it will have to tear itself down first by 
   sending a FE teardown message to CE, then for the PL to send a 
   TMLclose primitive to local TML to close all TML connections. 
    
   TML connections can be modified or released, some new connections 
   can be added even after TMLopen service primitive has been executed. 
   All newly modified connection information will immediately trigger 
   CMC to change the connection state.  
    
   CMC generates TML events and notify local PL of the events by 
   executing corresponding callback functions, which is logged during PL 
   subscription of these events. The TML events generated by CMC are: 
    
   .TML failure event. 
   This event will happen when the minimum required TML connections (as 
   described above) are unavailable.  
   (More TBD) 
    
4.2.Arbiter Component (AC)

Internet Draft              ForCES TML over IP            Mar. 2006 
 
 
    
   Arbiter Component (AC) should fulfill the following tasks: 
    
   1. To decide when and at what a pace to inject PL messages into TML 
   connections 
    
   By AC fulfilling this task, it is expected the IP TML will meet the 
   TML requirements for prioritization, congestion control, and 
   protection against DoS attacks from redirect data.  
    
   2. To decide which connection(s) a PL message to be injected into.  
    
   AC does this work by use of the ”TML Connection Table?generated by 
   CMC and shared by the AC as described above. AC will use 
   the ”Destination ID? ”Message type?and ”Message priority? which 
   are associated with every message received from PL, to match the 
   table to find out the corresponding IP TML connection(s). 
     
   3. To encapsulate PL messages to packets of TML connections or to 
   decapsulate PL messages from packets of TML connections. 
    
   4. To receive PL messages from TML connections and send them to PL 
   by use of TML service primitives 
    
   On receiving packets coming from peer TML, the IP TML just de-
   encapsulate them to get PL messages, then to put the messages in a 
   receive queue waiting for PL to use service primitive to fetch.  
    
   5. To generate TML events and to notify local PL of the events by 
   executing corresponding callback functions if the events have been 
   subscribed by the PL.  
    
   The TML events generated by AC are: 
    
   .TML message arrival event 
   .Redirect message congestion event. 
   .Control message congestion event 
   .DoS attack alert event.  
    
    
5. IP TML to meet TML Requirements 
    
   This section defines how ForCES IP TML is specified to meet ForCES 
   TML requirements. 
    
5.1.Reliability 
    
   This IP TML meets the reliability requirement by defining that PL 
   control messages must be transported by TCP, while PL redirect 
   messages must be transported by UDP. 
 
W. M. Wang               Expires Sept., 2006                 [Page 11] 
Internet Draft              ForCES TML over IP            Mar. 2006 
 
 
    
   TCP reliability features like no packet loss, no reordering, and no 
   corruption then maps to the reliability of PL control message 
   transportation, but note that TCP does not grantee a timely 
   transportation, therefore timeliness should be specifically addressed. 
    
   The reason to mandate UDP for PL redirect messages is that: 
    
   1. UDP provides relatively raw data transportation performance, 
      which fits well in the cases where the application level of which 
      may further be embedded with some Internet protocols like IP, UDP 
      and even congestion awareness protocols like TCP protocol.  
      Usually, redirect data may contain data that runs protocols like 
      TCP, UDP, and IP. 
   2. UDP provides multicast mechanism. Redirect data generated by CE 
      may often have to do multicast to many FEs, like some routing 
      protocols may have to do for their messages.  
    
5.2.Security 
   (TBD) 
    
5.3.Congestion Control and Protection against DoS Attacks 
    
   Although PL control messages and redirect messages are transmitted 
   separately over TCP and UDP, such separation itself does not provide 
   congestion control and protection against DoS attacks from redirect 
   data [GRMP-TEST]. Therefore, IP TML using the framework as Figure 4 
   may still face the danger of control messages being congested or even 
   DoS attacked.  
    
   This specification does not specify any detailed implementation on 
   how the IP TML meets the Congestion and DoS attack protection 
   requirement. This specification also does not require that an IP TML 
   implementation must provide a pure IP TML layer mechanism for 
   congestion control and protection against DoS attacks, although 
   individual implementations may apply such mechanism. Instead, this 
   specification just defines that an IP TML must provide the following 
   functions so that PL may use these functions to construct a PL level 
   congestion control and DoS attack protection. The TML functions 
   include: 
    
   1. DoS attack alert event. 
   2. Congestion report events, which include control message 
      congestion event report and redirect message congestion report. 
    
5.4.High Availability 
    
   ForCES protocol has provided Heartbeat Messages specifically for 
   CE/FE availability detection at PL layer, therefore TML layer does 
   not need to take more care of CE/FE level availability. 
 
W. M. Wang               Expires Sept., 2006                 [Page 12] 
Internet Draft              ForCES TML over IP            Mar. 2006 
 
 
    
   TML may take care of High Availability on TML connections. 
    
   In this IP TML, every TML connection is a TCP-UDP pair connection. A 
   TCP connection is connection-oriented and has provided connection 
   management. Although UDP does not provide such connection management, 
   the UDP is defined to have to associate to a TCP to form a TCP-UDP 
   pair. As a Result, IP TML connections that are TCP-UDP pairs usually 
   do not need to have extra means like heartbeat to detect its 
   connection availability. 
     
5.5.Multicast 
    
   PL level Multicast for ForCES messages must map to IP TML level 
   multicast by the following rules: 
    
   . Multicast control messages from a CE to FEs or from a FE to CEs 
   must map to multiple unicast TCPs at IP TML  
   . Multicast redirect messages from a CE to FEs or from a FE to CEs 
   must map to UDP multicast at IP TML  
    
   To fulfill UDP multicast at the IP TML level, a parameter to specify 
   the IP multicast address to the PL level multicast group must be 
   assigned. This is defined as a TML attribute, called UDP multicast 
   list. The purpose of the attribute is to assign an IP multicast 
   address to a ForCES level multicast group, so that UDP can use this 
   IP multicast address as its multicast IP address. The attribute 
   therefore has the following element: 
    
             {groupID, IPMcastAdd} 
    
   Where, groupID is the PL level multicast groupID, IPMcastAdd is a 
   multicast IP address. 
    
   The attribute can be defined in xml as below: 
    
   <dataTypeDef> 
      <name>UDPMcastList</name>  
      <synopsis> 
      A list mapping IP multicast address to PL level multicast group

             <name>IPMcastAdd</name>  
             <synopsis> IP multicast address </synopsis>

   </attribute> 
    
   IP TML multicast can further be divided into four cases, according 
   to the multicast message types and the transmission directions, as 
   below:  
    
   1. Multicast control messages from a CE to FEs 
   2. Multicast control messages from a FE to CEs 
   3. Multicast redirect messages from a CE to FEs 
   4. Multicast redirect messages from a FE to CEs 
    
   They are described in details as followed. 
    
   1. Multicast control messages from a CE to FEs 
    
   This is mapped to IP TML by with multiple unicast TCPs, and by the 
   following steps: 
    
   a. CE PL (or its application layer) forms a PL level multicast list. 
   TML Service Primitive has defined such multicast list as an attribute 
   of TML [TML-SP]. The attribute includes the following elements: 
    
             {FEgroupID, FEmemberID1, FEmemberID2, ...} 
              
   Where, FEgroupID is the multicast FE group ID, followed are the FE 
   members of the multicast. 
    
   b. CE PL sends the PL mulitcast list to the CE TML by TMLconfig 
   service primitives.   
    
   c. CE PL also send the PL multicast list to all FE members by use of 
   ForCES protocol configure messages. The FEs further send the PL 
   multicast list to the FE TMLs.  
    
   d. When a CE PL generates and sends to CE TML a control message 
   marked with the FEgroupID as its destinations, the CE TML distributes 
   the messages to individual TCP connections according to the FE member 
   IDs and the connection information in TML connection tables.

Internet Draft              ForCES TML over IP            Mar. 2006 
 
 
   e. At the FEs side, when a CE PL message marked with such FEgroupID 
   arrives at the FE TML, the FE TML just accepts the message and 
   delivers it to the FE PL, for the FE TML knows it is a member of the 
   multicast from the multicast list configured. 
     
   2. Multicast control messages from a FE to CEs 
    
   (TBD) 
    
   3. Multicast redirect messages from a CE to FEs 
    
   This multicast is mapped to IP TML with UDP multicast, and by the 
   following steps: 
    
   a. CE PL (or its application layer) forms a PL multicast list and a 
   UDP multicast list for the PL multicast. The UDP multicast list is 
   defined as before. 
    
   b. CE PL then sends the PL mulitcast list and the UDP multicast list 
   to the CE TML by TMLconfig service primitives.  
    
   c. When the CE TML receives the UDP multicast list, it triggers some 
   IP layer multicast protocol, like IGMP, to let the CE TML join in the 
   IP multicast group designated by the IP multicast address in the UDP 
   multicast list. 
    
   d. CE PL also send the PL multicast list and the UDP multicast list 
   to all FE members by use of ForCES protocol configure messages. The 
   FE members further send the lists to their TMLs.  
    
   e. When an FE TML has received the UDP multicast list, it triggers 
   some IP layer multicast protocol, like IGMP, to let the FE TML join 
   in the IP multicast group. 
    
   f. When a CE generates and sends to the CE TML a PL redirect message 
   marked with the multicast group ID as its destinations, the CE TML 
   transmits the message using UDP protocol and using the IP multicast 
   address designated by UDP multicast list.  
    
   g. At the FEs side, because the TMLs of all FE members have already 
   joined in the IP multicast group, any of the FE TMLs can receive the 
   packet transported by the IP multicast address. The PL redirect 
   message in the packet then be delivered to the FE PL.  
    
   4. Multicast redirect messages from a FE to CEs 
   (TBD) 
    
5.6.Prioritization

Internet Draft              ForCES TML over IP            Mar. 2006 
 
 
   This IP TML can meet the different prioritization from PL level by 
   use of several TCP-UDP pair connections between one same CE and one 
   same FE.  
    
5.7.Encapsulation 
 
   1. TCP Encapsulation 
    
   When ForCES PL messages are transported over TCP, a TCP port number 
   or port numbers (if multiple TCP connections are established) that 
   are specifically assigned for ForCES protocol should be adopted. 
    
   The encapsulation format is as below:  
    
     0                   1                   2                   3 
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

    ~    TCP header with the port number for the ForCES protocol    ~

   2. UDP Encapsulation 
    
   When ForCES PL messages are transported over UDP protocol, a UDP 
   port number that is specifically assigned to ForCES protocol should 
   be used.  
    
   The encapsulation format is as below:  
    
     0                   1                   2                   3

    ~    UDP header with the port number for the ForCES protocol    ~
