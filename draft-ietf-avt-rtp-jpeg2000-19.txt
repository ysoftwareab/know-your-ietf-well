Abstract

   This memo describes an RTP payload format for the ISO/IEC
   International Standard 15444-1 | ITU-T Rec. T.800, otherwise better
   known as: JPEG 2000.  JPEG 2000 features are considered in the design
   of this payload format.  JPEG 2000 is a truly scalable compression
   technology allowing applications to encode once and decode many
   different ways.  JPEG 2000 video stream is formed by extending from a
   single image to a series of JPEG 2000 images.

Internet-Draft                JPEG 2000 RTP                     Apr 2008


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies a payload format for JPEG 2000 video streams
   over the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP).  JPEG 2000 is an ISO/IEC
   International Standard and ITU-T Recommendation (ISO/IEC
   International Standard 15444-1 | ITU-T Rec. T.800) developed for next
   generation still image compression.  JPEG stands for the: Joint
   Photograhers Experts Group.  An international group made of academia
   and industry to develop image compression standards.  JPEG 2000 basic
   compression technology is described in detail in ISO JPEG 2000 Part
   1: Core Coding System[1] with motion covered in ISO JPEG 2000 Part 3:
   Motion JPEG 2000 [9].

   Part 3 of the JPEG 2000 standard defines Motion JPEG 2000 [9].
   However, Motion JPEG 2000 focuses on the file format and it does not
   specify the transmission format for the network.  This document
   specifies a transmission format for the network for a series of JPEG
   2000 images.

   JPEG 2000 supports many powerful features [1] [9]that are not
   supported in the current JPEG standard such as:

   o  Higher compression efficiency than JPEG with less visual
      distortion especially at extreme compression ratios.

   o  A single codestream that offers both lossy and lossless
      compression.

   o  Better error resiliency than JPEG.

   o  Progressive transmission by pixel accuracy (SNR scalability) and
      resolution (resolution scalability.)

   o  Random codestream access and processing.

   The JPEG 2000 algorithm is briefly explained.  Figure 1 shows a block
   diagram of the JPEG 2000 encoding method.

             Figure 1: Block diagram of the JPEG 2000 encoder

   The image is first transformed into wavelet coefficients.  The image
   is sampled into various levels vertically and horizontally from high
   frequencies (which contain sharp details) to low frequencies (which
   contain smooth areas.)  Quantization is performed on the coefficients
   within each sub-band.

   After quantization, code blocks are formed from within the precincts
   within the tiles.  (Precincts are a finer separation than tiles and
   code blocks are the smallest separation of the image data.)  EBCOT
   coding (Embedded Block Coding Optimized for Truncation) is performed
   within each code block and arithmetically encoded by bit plane.  Rate
   control is performed to achieve the highest quality image for a
   specified rate.

   As a result, for a given tile, data units called JPEG 2000 packets
   are generated, which contain data from a specific layer, a specific
   component, a specific resolution, or a specific precinct, depending
   on the data ordering.

   Finally, the JPEG 2000 packets are interleaved according to the
   progression along four axes: layer, resolution, component and
   precinct, and add a JPEG 2000 header to become a fully compliant JPEG
   2000 codestream.

   To decompress a JPEG 2000 codestream, one would follow the reverse
   order of the encoding order, without the quantization, and rate
   control.

   It is outside the scope of this document to further describe in
   detail this procedure.  Please refer to various JPEG 2000 texts for
   further details [1].

   Figure 2 shows a JPEG 2000 codestream in detail.  A JPEG 2000
   codestream is structured from the main header beginning with the SOC
   (Start Of Codestream) marker, one or more tiles, and the EOC (End Of
   Codestream) marker to indicate the end of the codestream.  Each tile
   consists of a tile-part header that starts with the SOT (Start of
   Tile) marker and ends with a SOD (Start of Data) marker, and
   bitstream (a series of JPEG 2000 packet.)

2.  JPEG 2000 Video Features

   JPEG 2000 video streams are formed as a continuous series of JPEG
   2000 still images.  Previously described features of JPEG 2000 may be
   used effectively in streaming applications for JPEG 2000 video.  A
   JPEG 2000 video stream has the following qualities:

   o  At low bit rates, the SNR is improved dramatically over JPEG and
      Motion JPEG.

   o  This is a full intra frame format - each frame is independently
      compressed - and therefore has a low encoding and decoding delay.

   o  JPEG 2000 has flexible and accurate rate control.

   o  This is suitable for traffic control and congestion control during
      network transmission.

   o  JPEG 2000 can provide its own codestream error resilience markers
      to aid in codestream recovery outside of this specification.

3.  Payload Design

   To design a payload format that maximizes JPEG 2000 features, the
   following are taken into consideration:

   o  Provisions for packet loss:

      On the Internet, 5% packet loss is common and this percentage may
      vary, upto 20% or more.  To split JPEG 2000 video streams into RTP
      packets, efficient packetization of the code stream is required to
      minimize problems in decoding due to missing packets.  If the main
      header is lost, the image cannot be decoded.

   o  JPEG 2000 Scalability

      JPEG 2000 has powerful scalability features and markers in the
      payload header indicate specific meaning of the payload.  Such as:

      *  Since this is primarily for video applications, special markers
         are used to indicate format (i.e. interlace odd/even fields).

      *  Special markers for the headers, fragment of headers, etc.

      *  Tile numbering for association of packets

      *  Priority importance of the packet using methods described in
         RFC XXXX [10].

      *  Main header recovery using methods described in RFC XXXX [10].

      Additional usage of the payload header is described in RFC XXXX
      [10].

4.  Payload Format

4.1.  RTP Fixed Header Usage

   For each RTP packet, the RTP fixed header is followed by the JPEG
   2000 RTP payload header, which is followed by the payload, a piece of
   a JPEG 2000 codestream, which is usually a JPEG 2000 packet.

   The RTP header fields that have a meaning specific to a JPEG 2000
   video stream are described as follows:

   Marker bit (M):  The marker bit of the RTP fixed header MUST be set
      to 1 for the last RTP packet of a video frame, otherwise, it MUST
      be 0.  When transmission is performed by multiple RTP sessions,
      this bit is 1 in the last packet of the frame in each session.

   Payload type (PT):  The payload type is dynamically assigned by means
      outside the scope of this document.  A payload type in the dynamic
      range shall be chosen by means of an out of band signaling
      protocol (i.e.  RTSP, SIP, etc.)

   Timestamp:  Tiemstamp indicates the presentation time of the frame
      contained in the RTP packet.  The same timestamp value MUST appear
      in each RTP packet carrying a fragment of a given frame.  When a
      JPEG 2000 image is in interlace format, the odd field and the
      corresponding even field MUST have the same timestamp value.  The
      initial value of the timestamp is to be random to counter known
      plaintext attacks on encryption.

      As for the clock rate, senders and receivers MUST support the
      90kHz RTP timestamp rate, and MAY support other rates.  RTP
      timestamp rates below 1000 Hz SHOULD NOT be used because they will
      result in insufficient resolution for RTCP measurements based on
      the RTP timestamp, such as the interarrival jitter.  The clock
      rate MUST be negotiated at the start of the session.  When using
      SDP, it MUST be expressed using the "rtpmap" attributes.  If non-
      90kHz clock rate is to be used, it is RECOMMENDED to present not
      only a preferable clock rate but also 90kHz clock rate with a
      different RTP payload type.

4.2.  RTP Payload Header Format

   The RTP payload header format for JPEG 2000 video stream is as
   follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   |tp |MHF|mh_id|T|     priority  |           tile number         |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |reserved       |             fragment offset                   |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+



             Figure 3: RTP payload header format for JPEG 2000

   tp (type) : 2 bits

      This field indicates how a JPEG 2000 image is scanned (progressive
      or interlace).

         0: The payload is progressively scanned.

         1: The payload is part of an odd field of an interlaced video
         frame.  The height specified in the JPEG 2000 main header is
         half of the height of the entire displayed image.  In a
         receiver, an odd field should be de-interlaced with the even
         field following it so that lines from each image are displayed
         alternately.

         2: The payload is part of an even field of an interlaced video
         signal.

   MHF (Main Header Flag) : 2 bits

      MHF indicates whether a main header or packet of a main header is
      in the RTP packet.

Internet-Draft                JPEG 2000 RTP                     Apr 2008


       If there is no header, MHF has a value of 0.  If there is just a
       part of a fragmented header, MHF has a value of 1.  If there is
      the last part of a fragmented header, MHF has value of 2.  If the
              whole header in the packet, MHF has a value of 3.

             +-----------+----------------------------------+
             | MHF Value | Description                      |
             +-----------+----------------------------------+
             |     0     | no main header in the payload    |
             |           |                                  |
             |     1     | piece of fragmented header       |
             |           |                                  |
             |     2     | last part of a fragmented header |
             |           |                                  |
             |     3     | a whole main header              |
             +-----------+----------------------------------+

                          Table 1: MHF Usage Values

   mh_id (Main Header Identification) : 3 bits

      Main header identification value.  This is used for JPEG 2000 main
      header recovery.

      For implementations following only this specification, the sender
      SHOULD set this value to 0 and the receiver SHOULD ignore this
      field on processing.

   T (Tile field invalidation flag) : 1 bit

      The T bit indicates whether the tile number field is valid or
      invalid.  A sender MUST set the T bit to 1 when invalid and 0 when
      valid.

      There are two cases where the tile number field is invalid:

      *  When an RTP packet holds only the main header.  A sender cannot
         set any number in the tile number field as no JPEG 2000 tile-
         part bitstream is included in the RTP packet.

      *  Multiple tile-parts are packed together in a single payload.
         If there are multiple tiles packed into a single payload, there
         is no meaning to assign a number to the tile number field.

   priority : 8 bits

      The priority field indicates the importance of the JPEG 2000
      packet included in the payload.  Typically, a higher priority is

      set in the packets containing JPEG 2000 packets containing the
      lower sub-bands.

      For implementations following only this specification, the sender
      SHOULD set this value to 255 and the receiver SHOULD ignore this
      field on processing.

   tile number : 16 bits

      This field shows the tile number of the payload.  This field is
      only valid when the T bit is 0.  If T bit is set to 1, the
      receiver MUST ignore this field.

   R (Reserved) : 8 bits

      This bit is reserved for future use.  Senders MUST set this to 0.
      Receivers MUST ignore this field.

   fragment offset : 24 bits

      This value MUST be set to the byte offset of the current payload
      in relation to the very beginning of each JPEG 2000 codestream
      (JPEG 2000 frame).

      Byte offsets are calculated from the start of each JPEG 2000
      codestream up to the current position where the current payload
      would fit into the complete JPEG 2000 codestream.

      To perform scalable video delivery by using multiple RTP sessions,
      the offset value from the first byte of the same frame is set for
      fragment offset.  It is then possible, to deliver layered video
      using multiple RTP sessions, the fragment offset may not start
      from 0 in some RTP sessions even if the packet is the first one
      received.

5.  RTP Packetization

   The sender must packetize the JPEG 2000 appropriately according to
   initial media type parameters and/or details from SDP offer/answer
   parameters.

   A "packetization unit" is defined as either a JPEG 2000 main header,
   a tile-part header, or a JPEG 2000 packet.

   First, a sender divides the JPEG 2000 codestream into packetization
   units by parsing the codestream or by getting information from the
   encoder, and packs the packetization units into RTP packets.  A
   sender can put an arbitrary number of packetization units into an RTP
   packet, but it MUST preserve the codestream order.  An example of
   this kind of RTP packet format is shown in Figure 4:

   +------+-------+---------------+---------------+
   |RTP   |payload| packetization | packetization |
   |header|header | unit          | unit          |
   +------+-------+---------------+---------------+


          Figure 4: An example with multiple packetization units

   If a packetization unit with headers (IP header, RTP header and
   payload header) is larger than the MTU size, it MAY be fragmented.
   To pack a fragmented packetization unit, the fragmented unit MUST NOT
   be packed with the succeeding packetization unit within the same RTP
   packet.  An example of this kind of RTP packet format is shown in
   Figure 5:

   +------+-------+-------------------------------------------------+
   |RTP   |payload| packetization unit fragment                     |
   |header|header |                                                 |

7.  SDP Parameters

7.1.  SDP Mapping

   The media type video/jpeg2000 string is mapped to fields in the
   Session Description Protocol (SDP) [7] as follows:

   o  The media name in the "m=" line of SDP MUST be video.

   o  The encoding name in the "a=rtpmap" line of SDP MUST be jpeg2000
      (the subtype).

   o  The clock rate in the "a=rtpmap" line is set according to the
      "rate" parameter.  Senders that wish to use a non-90kHz rate
      SHOULD also offer the same stream using a 90kHz timestamp rate
      with a different RTP payload type allowing graceful fallback to
      90kHz for compatibility.

   o  The REQUIRED parameter, "sampling", MUST be included in the
      "a=fmtp" line of SDP.

   o  The OPTIONAL parameters, if presented, MUST be included in the
      "a=fmtp" line of SDP.

   These parameters are expressed as a media type string, in the form of
   a semicolon separated list of parameter=value pairs.

   Therefore, an example of media representation in SDP using typical
   parameters is as follows:

      m=video 49170/2 RTP/AVP 98
      a=rtpmap:98 jpeg2000/90000
      a=fmtp:98 sampling=YCbCr-4:2:0;width=128;height=128

   An example for using non-90kHz timestamp is as follows:

      m=video 49170/2 RTP/AVP 98 99
      a=rtpmap:98 jpeg2000/27000000
      a=rtpmap:99 jpeg2000/90000
      a=fmtp:98 sampling=YCbCr-4:2:0;width=128;height=128
      a=fmtp:99 sampling=YCbCr-4:2:0;width=128;height=128

7.2.  Usage with the SDP Offer/Answer Model

   When offering JPEG 2000 over RTP using SDP in an Offer/Answer model
   [8], the following rules and limitations apply:





Futemma, et al.         Expires October 26, 2008               [Page 18]

Internet-Draft                JPEG 2000 RTP                     Apr 2008


   o  All parameters MUST have an acceptable value for the parameter.

   o  All parameters MUST correspond to the parameters of the payload.

   o  The parameter "sampling" with an acceptable answer MUST appear in
      the offer and in the answer if accepted by the receiver.  The
      receiver SHOULD do its best to handle received codestream in the
      color space offered.  If the receiver cannot handle the offered
      color space for whatever reason, it should reply with its
      preferred color space in the answer and gracefully end the
      session.  Senders do not need conform to the color space in the
      answer but should take note that the session ended due to color
      sampling issues.

   o  For optional parameter: "interlace", if this option is used, it
      MUST appear in the offer and if accepted it SHOULD appear in the
      answer.  Receivers should do their best to handle interlace or
      progressive codestreams but if for some reason, receivers cannot
      accomodate, receivers should reply with preferred settings in the
      answer then gracefully end the session.  Senders do not need to
      adjust settings upon this answer but should take note that the
      session ended due to interlace or progressive issues.

   o  For optional parameters "width" and "height" the following
      applies:

      *  if "width" appears in the offer or answer, "height" MUST be
         present.

      *  if "height" appears in the offer or answer, "width" MUST be
         present.

   o  Width and height should appear in the offer as the maximum
      dimensions the sender can offer.  In the answer, it SHOULD
      represent the maximum the receiver can accomodate.  If there is a
      difference between the offer and answer, the sender should re-
      offer a new width and height and appropriately scale down the
      codestream for the receiver.

   o  In a multicast environment, [14] receivers should do their best to
      conform to parameters in the offer from the sender.  Senders
      should use recommended settings in multicast environments and take
      note of answers.  For width and height, the sender should
      accomodate to the lowest values it receives from all answers.

   o  Any unknown options in the Offer should be ignored and deleted
      from the Answer.

   An example offer/answer exchanges, where an offerer wishes to use
   non-90kHz timestamp, are provided.

   space, interleace image, 720-pixel width and 480-pixel height.  She
   puts 27MHz clock rate attributes prior to 90kHz because she wants to
   use 27 MHz rather than 90kHz.

8.  IANA Consideration

   It is requested that one new media subtype (video/jpeg2000) is
   registered by IANA.  For details, see of this document.

9.  Security Consideration

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification [3], and in any applicable RTP profile.  The main
   security considerations for the RTP packet carrying the RTP payload
   format defined within this memo are confidentiality, integrity and
   source authenticity.  Confidentiality is achieved by encryption of
   the RTP payload.  Integrity of the RTP packets through the use of
   suitable cryptographic integrity protection mechanism.  Cryptographic
   system may also allow the authentication of the source of the
   payload.  A suitable security mechanism for this RTP payload format
   should provide confidentialty, integrity protection and at least a
   source authentication method capable of determining if an RTP packet
   is from a member of the RTP session or not.

   Note that the appropriate mechanism to provide security to RTP and
   payloads following this memo may vary.  It is dependent on the
   application, the transport, and the signalling protocol employed.
   Therefore a single mechanism is not sufficient, although if suitable
   the usage of SRTP [4] is recommended.  Other mechanism that may be
   used are IPsec [11] and TLS [12] (RTP over TCP), but also other
   alternatives may exist.

Internet-Draft                JPEG 2000 RTP                     Apr 2008


10.  Congestion Control

   If QoS enhanced service is used, RTP receivers SHOULD monitor packet
   loss to ensure that the service that was requested is actually being
   delivered.  If it is not, then they SHOULD assume that they are
   receiving best-effort service and behave accordingly.

   If best-effort service is being used, users of this payload format
   MUST monitor packet loss to ensure that the packet loss rate is
   within acceptable parameters.  Packet loss is considered acceptable
   if a TCP flow across the same network path, experiencing the same
   network conditions, would achieve an average throughput, measured on
   a reasonable timescale, that is not less than the RTP flow is
   achieving.  This condition can be satisfied by implementing
   congestion control mechanisms to adapt the transmission rate (or the
   number of layers subscribed for a layered multicast session), or by
   arranging for a receiver to leave the session if the loss rate is
   unacceptably high.

A.1.  Recommended Practices

   As the JPEG 2000 coding standard is highly flexible, many different
   but compliant data streams may be produced and be a compliant JPEG
   2000 codestream.

   The following is a set of recommendations set forth from our
   experience in developing JPEG 2000 and this payload specification.
   Implementations of this standard must handle all possibilities
   mentioned in this specification.  The following is a listing of items
   an implementation may optimize.

   Error Resilience Markers:  The use of error resilience markers in the
      JPEG 2000 data stream is highly recommended in all situations.
      Error recovery with these markers is helpful to the decoder and
      save external resources.  Markers such as: RESET, RESTART, and
      ERTERM.

   YCbCr Color space:  The YCbCr color space provides the greatest
      amount of compression in color with respect to the human visual
      system.  When used with JPEG 2000, the usage of this color space
      can provide excellent visual results at extreme bit rates.

   Progression Ordering:  JPEG 2000 offers many different ways to order
      the final code stream to optimize the transfer with the
      presentation.  We have found the most useful codestream ordering
      have been for layer progression and resolution progression
      ordering.

   Tiling and Packets:  JPEG 2000 packets are formed regardless of the
      encoding method.  The encoder has little control over the size of
      these JPEG 2000 packets as they maybe large or small.
      Tiling splits the image up into smaller areas and each are encoded
      separately.  With tiles, the JPEG 2000 packet sizes are also
      reduced.  When using tiling, almost all JPEG 2000 packet sizes are
      an acceptable size (i.e. smaller than the MTU size of most
      networks.)

   Sender Processing:  There are no limitations as to how the sender
      should pack the payload.  In general, the sender should pack
      headers separately from the rest of the codestream to make header
      recovery simple.  Payloads should generally begin with an SOP
      marker and end with EPH marker for easier decoder processing.
