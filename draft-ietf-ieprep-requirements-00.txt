Abstract  
    
   This document outlines requirements that need to be met in IP-based 
   networks to enable and support communications for National 
   Security/Emergency Preparedness (NS/EP) operations. It provides a 
   basis from which an emergency telecommunications service can be 
   negotiated and provides a set of requirements that should be met for 
   acceptable emergency telecommunication capabilities for disaster 
   recovery operations. The focus here is on network requirements, 
   rather than requirements for particular applications. The 
   requirements are general, functional, and are intended to provide 
   wide latitude in implementation options for service providers.

1. Introduction 
    
   Natural and man-made disasters can happen anywhere, anytime. These 
   include, for example, earthquakes, floods, airplane crashes, and 
   terrorist attacks. While some advance planning is possible for 
   expected disaster events, most disasters happen unexpectedly. 
    
   Readily available telecommunication capabilities are essential for 
   emergency recovery operations to quickly start saving lives and 
   restoring the community infrastructure. A number of 
   telecommunication facilities can be involved in disaster recovery 
   operations. These include local mobile radio, dedicated satellite 
   systems, transportable capabilities, and the public 
   telecommunications infrastructure. Some of these facilities need to 
   be deployed to the disaster site and very likely may not be 
   immediately available. The public telecommunication services, 
   however, are generally at hand except in the most remote areas. The

Internet-Draft          Emergency Requirements                 June 2002 
 
 
   publicly available capabilities include the traditional telephone 
   network and the Internet, which can both be accessed via wire line, 
   wireless, and various broadband facilities. Disaster recovery 
   operations can significantly benefit from a variety of modes for 
   interchange of critical information to organize and coordinate the 
   emergency activities. Emergency voice communications are supported 
   today by a preferential service through public telephone networks in 
   some countries. Now, however, an evolution is taking place in 
   traditional public telecommunication networks toward integrating 
   circuit-switched and packet-based technologies. This promises to 
   provide a rich menu of fully integrated capabilities for handling 
   voice, message, data, and video traffic to greatly enhance disaster 
   recovery operations. 
    
   Mostly voice traffic using either VoIP or conventional telephony is 
   used today for emergency communications over wireline and wireless 
   facilities. However, narrowband modes can also be effectively 
   applied, including instant messaging, email, and telemedicine 
   telemetry. In addition, wideband capabilities for video broadcast, 
   conferencing, and telemedicine will also greatly enhance emergency 
   recovery operations. 
    
   During serious disaster events, public networking facilities can 
   experience severe stress due to damaged infrastructure and heavy 
   traffic loads. As bandwidth gets severely constrained, it becomes 
   difficult to establish and maintain effective communication 
   sessions. It is essential that disaster recovery operations be able 
   to readily communicate to organize and coordinate essential 
   activities. Authorized emergency communication sessions need to have 
   immediate access to available network resources and be given a high 
   probability of successful completion of these critical 
   communications to help save lives and restore community 
   infrastructure. 
    
   Only people authorized by the appropriate authority are permitted to 
   establish emergency communication sessions through public networking 
   facilities for facilitating immediate disaster recovery operations. 
   Those typically authorized are local police, fire, and medical 
   personnel as well as designated government officials from local, 
   regional, and national levels who are responsible for various 
   aspects of disaster recovery operations. 
    
   All emergency communication sessions should be processed as normal 
   traffic along with all non-emergency traffic when sufficient network 
   bandwidth and resources are available. ONLY when networks reach 
   traffic saturation is there a need for giving emergency 
   communication sessions a higher probability of completion over non-
   emergency communications. While this occurrence may never happen in

Internet-Draft          Emergency Requirements                 June 2002 
 
 
   the typical Internet-based environment, capabilities for 
   preferential handling of emergency traffic need to be established in 
   preparation for a serious catastrophe. These provisions should be in 
   place before a potential doomsday disaster, even for highly over-
   provisioned networks. It is better to be prepared ahead of time and 
   not wait for the worst to happen first. 
    
   The telecommunication capabilities for handling authorized emergency 
   traffic should be accomplished using existing applications and 
   standards whenever possible. Establishment of new and different 
   standards would be both costly and unlikely to ever be implemented. 
   The desired approach is to adopt existing standards and where needed 
   adapt new standards with any necessary adjustments needed to support 
   preferential treatment of emergency traffic during severe periods of 
   congestion.  
    
   This document outlines requirements that need to be met in public 
   and private IP-based networks to enable communications for National 
   Security/Emergency Preparedness (NS/EP) operations.  Recovery 
   activities can involve person-to-person communications, group 
   coordination, disaster assessment application execution, remote 
   information retrieval, continuity of government, etc. 
    
   From a network perspective, processing communications can be 
   particularly difficult even if the network infrastructure has not 
   been the target of a terrorist or affected by a natural disaster.  
   This is because there can be a drastic surge in the network load in 
   response to a disaster.  In recent years the Public Switched 
   Telephone Network (PSTN) has experienced load levels three to five 
   times normal immediately after an event [1], and the same is 
   expected for the Internet, especially as IP telephony becomes more 
   prevalent. 
    
1.1 Current PSTN Capabilities 
    
   As a starting point, the model to consider for emergency 
   communication services is the existing service capability in the 
   United States PSTN, the Government Emergency Telecommunications 
   Service (GETS).  Some other countries have similar services. 
    
   The purpose of GETS is to increase the probability of completion of 
   a telephone call for authorized operations personnel in times of 
   emergencies.  It does not guarantee that service will be available, 
   but it does implement a set of functions that increase the 
   likelihood of finding an available circuit to complete a call in the 
   PSTN. 
    
   The key aspects of GETS are as follows: 

 
Folts & Beard             Expires - December 2002               [Page 4]  
 
Internet-Draft          Emergency Requirements                 June 2002 
 
 
    
      o Personnel gain access to GETS by calling a specified telephone 
        number and presenting a credit-card type of authentication. 
    
      o Having authenticated themselves, the call is completed on a 
        preferential high probability of completion basis.  If calls 
        are initially blocked, they can be queued and switched to 
        alternate carriers. 
    
      o If fundamental telephone services are compromised, services 
        contracted under GETS are restored first. This is under the 
        provisions of TSP (Telecommunication Service Priority [2]), 
        which is independent of GETS. 
    
   These features enhance the capability of NS/EP calls to be completed 
   with a high probability in congested networks.  GETS will not 
   preempt public telephone calls, nor are there multiple levels of 
   precedence within GETS. 
    
   The approach of GETS is based on a preferential, high probability of 
   completion, treatment model. This model may also be used by 
   providers of Internet-based network services. 
    
1.2 Purpose and Scope of this Document 
    
   The purpose of this document is to provide a basis from which 
   emergency service capabilities can be specified and negotiated 
   between network service providers and customers.  It provides a set 
   of requirements that would need to be met for a service to 
   acceptably support emergency communications.  The focus here is on 
   network requirements, rather than requirements for particular 
   applications. For particular requirements related to IP Telephony, 
   see [3]. 
    
   More importantly, however, the requirements given here are quite 
   general and it is intended that wide latitude be available to 
   service providers to implement emergency services as they consider 
   appropriate.  In [4], recommendations are provided as to how best to 
   implement these services, but in this document requirements are 
   stated so that service providers need not necessarily follow [4]. 
    
   Section 2 provides general requirements that give high-level service 
   capabilities that should be provided.  Section 3 then provides a 
   minimal set of specific technical requirements for meeting the 
   general requirements.  Section 4 gives special considerations that 
   may optionally be addressed in an agreement for emergency services. 
   And finally, Section 5 provides a list of policy decisions that need

Internet-Draft          Emergency Requirements                 June 2002 
 
 
   to be made and explained to customers by a service provider, but no 
   specific requirements are given for policy issues. 
    
2. General Requirements 
    
   This section outlines five requirements for services that aim to 
   provide emergency communications for the Internet-based 
   infrastructure (or any telecommunication medium for that manner).  
   They pertain to the ability to begin communications, complete 
   communications successfully, and conduct them in an authorized and 
   private manner. 
    
2.1 Availability 
    
   The most fundamental requirement for emergency telecommunication 
   services is that emergency-related users must have a high likelihood 
   of network resources being available to them when they need them.  
   Authorized users must have a high probability of being able to 
   initiate and complete a communication session. 
    
   Two interpretations of the concept of "high availability" could be 
   applied, either in a relative sense or an absolute sense.  Such 
   options on interpretation give latitude in implementation 
   possibilities for emergency services.  The first interprets "high 
   availability" in a preferential or relative sense.  Authorized users 
   would have preferred access to resources over normal users.  A 
   service provider would implement mechanisms to identify and treat 
   emergency traffic in special ways.  Such an approach would allow a 
   service provider to avoid having to meet specific availability 
   targets (e.g., 95% availability) through an assurance that is given 
   to emergency customers that their traffic is being treated 
   preferentially.  If the network is stressed, availability for 
   emergency users may decrease, but it would still be relatively 
   higher (even much higher) than for normal users. 
    
   In the second interpretation, high availability would mean absolute 
   availability levels that would be provided regardless of the network 
   operating conditions.  Service providers may choose to provide high 
   availability levels through overprovisioning even when the network 
   is stressed.  They could choose to avoid using any mechanisms to 
   identify or preferentially treat emergency traffic, because 
   emergency traffic requirements would be met by the default operation 
   of their network. 
    
2.2 Dependability 
    
   Authorized users must not only be able to initiate communication 
   sessions; they must also be able to successfully complete their 
 
Folts & Beard             Expires - December 2002               [Page 6]  
 
Internet-Draft          Emergency Requirements                 June 2002 
 
 
   intended activities.  While PSTN services basically provide such 
   dependability by default, communications through the Internet might 
   be affected by a variety of network operating conditions, such as 
   congestion or link failures. An emergency telecommunication service 
   needs to protect authorized communications from being affected by 
   those conditions, at least to the extent that an emergency 
   communication session can still be conducted acceptably.  
   Definitions of acceptable performance will vary depending on the 
   application. 
    
2.3 Authorized Access 
    
   Mechanisms must be implemented so that only authorized users have 
   access to emergency telecommunications services.  Such authorization 
   could be PIN-based or based on assignment of cryptographic keys [5]. 
   Authorization protects network resources from excessive use and 
   abuse.  The two purposes for this requirement are to restrict usage 
   of network resources only to those who are allowed to use them and 
   to enable proper billing.  Even when using an overprovisioning 
   approach where emergency users are not provided special services, 
   proper billing necessitates authorized access. 
    
   In today's public telephone networks a credit-card process is used. 
   This means entry of 32 digits of information to complete 
   establishment of a communication session. This is cumbersome and 
   time-consuming. With future technology in an Internet-based 
   infrastructure there is a need for a more time-responsive and 
   streamlined mechanism for rapid authentication.  
    
   Such authorization mechanisms should be flexible enough to provide 
   various levels of restriction and authorization depending on the 
   expectations of a particular service or customer.  For example, it 
   might be desirable to provide access to emergency telecommunication 
   services differently after a hurricane where the emergency was 
   caused by a natural disaster as compared to after a terrorist attack 
   that was caused by humans.  In the hurricane scenario, members of 
   the general public might be given access (e.g., at a lower 
   precedence level than emergency response organizations) where after 
   a terrorist attack security concerns might necessitate highly 
   restrictive access to emergency services. 
    
   Further requirements and recommended procedures are given in [5]. 
    
2.4 Security Protection 
    
   The overall problem of Internet security is being pursued by 
   appropriate and expert resources in the IETF and elsewhere. However, 
   specific problems of emergency traffic need to be considered. 

 
Folts & Beard             Expires - December 2002               [Page 7]  
 
Internet-Draft          Emergency Requirements                 June 2002 
 
 
   Emergency traffic needs to be protected against intrusion, spoofing, 
   and specifically, denial of service. If overall security measures 
   that are established do not satisfy these specific requirements, 
   additional consideration should be given to protection specifically 
   focused on emergency traffic. This is discussed further in [5]. 
    
2.5 Privacy 
    
   Some emergency communications will have a requirement that they not 
   be susceptible to viewing or modification by others, due to the 
   sensitive and urgent nature of emergency response activities. An 
   emergency telecommunications service should be able to protect the 
   integrity of all emergency user communications and have options to 
   encrypt certain user traffic. However, due to urgency and short-term 
   meaningfulness of the content at initial stages of disaster 
   response, encryption will have limited application. 
    
3. Technical Requirements 
    
   The following technical requirements represent the functions that 
   need to be fulfilled to enable the general requirements listed above 
   to be realized.  For several of the requirements below, it is 
   assumed that networks will experience temporary scarcity of 
   resources, especially because of damaged infrastructure and high 
   demand immediately following a disaster.  If a service provider 
   employs an over provisioning approach to provide emergency services 
   so that resources are never scarce, some of the following 
   requirements might not be necessary. 
    
3.1 Identification of Emergency Traffic 
    
   Emergency traffic should be recognized in the forwarding plane.  An 
   emergency telecommunication service should have procedures by which 
   emergency traffic is marked so that it can be identified throughout 
   the network.  The decisions about who does such marking (i.e., end 
   users or the network), where it occurs, who recognizes such marking, 
   whether re-marking might occur, and at what layer or layers marking 
   is implemented are left to the discretion of the policy makers and 
   specified in service level agreements. Standardized mechanisms, 
   however, should be utilized. 
    
3.2 Signaling for Resource Requests 
    
   Emergency traffic should be recognized in the control plane.  For 
   applications where sessions need to be established or network 
   resources reserved, signaling mechanisms can be used to support the 
   differentiation of emergency signaling messages.

Internet-Draft          Emergency Requirements                 June 2002 
 
 
3.3 Better Then Best Effort Service 
    
   The default best-effort forwarding behavior available in existing 
   routers as standardized in [6] does not provide performance 
   assurances.  This is especially true for emergency services where 
   severe congestion that accompanies disasters can cause the 
   performance of best-effort delivery to degrade well below acceptable 
   levels. 
    
   Quality of service for emergency telecommunication services does not 
   necessarily mean better quality of voice/video as compared to what 
   is available to normal users. The same QoS classes, which are 
   already defined for normal traffic, can be utilized for emergency 
   traffic as well. 
    
   The fundamental quality of service requirement for emergency traffic 
   is this - better than best effort service.  Service providers have 
   the freedom to implement special quality of service mechanisms to 
   meet this requirement, but other approaches may be effective as 
   well. 
    
   Better than best effort service is provided to emergency traffic so 
   that it will receive assured performance levels that are at or above 
   a minimum performance level.  Without such a requirement, the 
   dependability requirement outlined above could not be met. 
    
   Emergency traffic that suffers degraded QoS, however, should not be 
   terminated but should be allowed to continue. Disaster response 
   operations must be given the best chance to communicate, even if 
   with difficulty. 
    
4. Special Requirements 
    
   In addition to the general and technical requirements given above, 
   this section provides additional requirements that may optionally be 
   requested for particular service agreements.  They primarily involve 
   the specification of the particular approach that is being used by 
   service providers for particular networks, applications, and types 
   of traffic. 
    
4.1 Application-Specific Support 
    
   The requirements in this document are for network layer mechanisms 
   to support emergency services.  In general, these network layer 
   mechanisms will provide support to the rich array of applications 
   that could be used for emergency response operations.  Specific 
   applications, however, may have additional requirements to be 
   acceptable for emergency users. 

 
Folts & Beard             Expires - December 2002               [Page 9]  
 
Internet-Draft          Emergency Requirements                 June 2002 
 
 
    
   Such requirements might include additional signalling or mechanisms 
   to provide preferential performance or dependability to authorized 
   users. Examples of applications include the following. 
    
     o  Voice on IP, using such signaling architectures as H.323 or SIP 
        [7].  
    
     o  Shared real-time whiteboard. 
    
     o  Instant messaging and presence. 
    
     o  Databases such as the Japanese "I am Alive" [8] service, for 
        communication with persons not involved in the crisis. 
    
     o  Database services for managing the crisis, including 
        calendaring, contact management, order and trouble report 
        management, legal services, medical services, etc. 
    
     o  Electronic mail. 
    
     o  Telemedicine, victim observation video, and vital-sign  
        telemetry 
    
     o  Damage assessment applications. 
    
     o  File transfer. 
    
     o  World Wide Web.  
    
   This document does not address specific requirements for these 
   applications.  The focus of this document is to provide requirements 
   for network service providers.  Requirements for the applications 
   should be met by content providers and end users.  However, network 
   service providers may wish to provide network-based services that 
   could improve the performance of particular applications, for 
   example by providing web caching. 
    
   Of specific interest to current emergency management organizations 
   are IP Telephony and Voice on IP.  Further requirements and 
   recommended procedures for these applications, in particular, are 
   given in [3]. In the future, however, it is anticipated that voice 
   communications will be overshadowed by a number of other multimedia 
   modes of communication that will significantly benefit emergency 
   recovery operations.

Internet-Draft          Emergency Requirements                 June 2002 
 
 
4.2 Traffic Types 
    
   Consideration should be given to the different traffic types in 
   supporting the different multimedia applications for emergency 
   telecommunication services.  The three types of traffic that may be 
   treated in distinctive ways are as follows. 
    
     o  Inelastic traffic - As defined in [9], inelastic traffic is 
        traffic which has a firm delay bound.  If packets arrive after 
        a maximum acceptable delay, the packets are essentially 
        worthless to the receiver.  Real-time audio and video are 
        examples of inelastic traffic. 
    
     o  Interactive elastic traffic - Elastic applications are 
        generally those which wait for data to arrive and do not 
        discard it if it is late.  This does not mean that applications 
        are insensitive to delay, however, because such delays could 
        hurt application performance significantly.  In particular, 
        interactive elastic traffic requires reasonable delays because 
        of the user interaction that is involved.  Examples of 
        interactive elastic traffic include HTTP and instant messaging 
        traffic. 
    
     o  Bulk transfer elastic traffic - Some elastic applications, 
        however, do not involve direct user interaction.  In such 
        cases, delay is not so much a concern as average throughput.  
        Bulk transfers can have large variations in delay as long as an 
        expected average throughput is obtained.  For example, if a 
        file can be downloaded in 100 seconds, it does not matter if 
        for part of the transfer the throughput was virtually zero.  
        Examples of bulk transfer traffic are FTP and SMTP. 
    
   As an example, service providers may wish to provide service 
   assurances for inelastic traffic using Diffserv [10] but use 
   overprovisioning for both types of elastic traffic. 
    
5. Policy Decisions 
    
   The above general and technical requirements provide wide latitude 
   for creativity on the part of service providers to implement 
   emergency services.  In addition to meeting the requirements above, 
   a series of policy decisions should be made in the implementation of 
   emergency services.  No particular approach is prescribed regarding 
   these policies.  However, the policies used by a service provider to 
   address the following issues should be clearly defined and 
   communicated.

   The user needs to determine specific policies for the emergency 
   telecommunications service, and these should be specified and agreed 
   upon in the service level agreement. 
    
5.1 Emergency Service Activation 
    
   Providers of an emergency service should specify whether emergency 
   treatment is always available within the network or whether the 
   service is only activated upon declaration of emergency conditions 
   by an appropriate authority.  Service providers may also choose to 
   provide a minimal service that is available at all times, but which 
   could be expanded once an emergency declaration was made. 
    
5.2 Restoration Procedures 
    
   Service providers should describe the restoration procedures they 
   will use when substantial damage is experienced in their network. 
   They should provide plans and estimates in advance of how damaged 
   facilities will affect the availability of emergency services and, 
   if a critical relationship exists, how prioritized restoration of 
   those vital facilities will be accomplished.  Service providers may, 
   of course, choose to rely upon rerouting mechanisms that would make 
   the restoration procedures they use irrelevant to the continued 
   dependability of emergency services.  The only concern in that case 
   is when damage could be so extensive that rerouting mechanisms would 
   be ineffective. Also see [2]. 
    
5.3 Preemption 
    
   Service providers may wish to provide resources for emergency 
   communications by interrupting particular non-emergency traffic 
   flows.  If such an approach is used, this should be explicitly 
   stated and details should be given on how preemption is carried out. 
   Regulatory guidelines in some jurisdictions may prohibit the use of 
   preemption to support emergency traffic. 
    
5.4 Cooperation Between Service Providers 
    
   Emergency users will only be concerned with the quality of the end-
   to-end communications they are provided.  However, it is possible 
   that no one particular service provider will be able to support that 
   service end-to-end.  Emergency services could be carried over a 
   combination of service providers, some of which would provide 
   emergency capabilities and some of which may not. 
    
   Service providers that do provide emergency services may choose to 
   provide services that are only operative within their networks and 
   are independent of other service providers.  Alternatively, service

Internet-Draft          Emergency Requirements                 June 2002 
 
 
   providers may employ mechanisms to cooperate with other service 
   providers to provide emergency services.  This would result in a 
   considerable portion of the end-to-end path being administered in a 
   cooperative fashion.  If so, service providers should specify the 
   mechanisms they would use and the extent to which they would 
   cooperate with other service providers to support emergency 
   services. 
    
6. Example Emergency Scenarios 
 
   Some example instances for emergency communications are described  
   below. These show some different levels of emergency communication  
   requirements that need to be supported. 
    
6.1 Local recovery operations 
    
   While mobile radio is the primary mode of communication for police 
   and fire brigade operations, there is often a need to supplement 
   these capabilities with access to the public telecommunication 
   networks. This is particularly needed during the initial stages and 
   immediately following a disaster event. These emergency 
   communications can be accomplished through use of wireless access 
   (cellular phone or PDA) where priority service may be necessary due 
   to congestion. Some mobile radio systems interface with public 
   networks, but their use is often discouraged or avoided because of 
   limited bandwidth availability in the frequency allocation. 
   Communications outside the immediate local radio coverage area are 
   often required to request additional resources from other areas and 
   to notify and coordinate operations with regional (e.g. county and 
   state) and national authorities. Public telecommunications services 
   provide at-hand capability to immediately support these critical 
   emergency communications 
    
6.2 Medical operations 
    
   The process of saving lives and providing medical treatment to 
   victims is greatly enhanced through the use of data telemetry to 
   remotely provide victim vital signs to a central medical center. In 
   addition, treatment of victims at the disaster site can be 
   significantly accelerated through the use of video telemedicine 
   transmissions to remote medical staff. These vital life-saving 
   communications can be very effectively supported by an Internet-
   based infrastructure. 
    
6.3 Regional operations 
    
   The magnitude of the event may require recovery support from 
   resources outside of the immediate area of impact. Critical

Internet-Draft          Emergency Requirements                 June 2002 
 
 
   information is provided for authorities to proclaim a disaster 
   crisis and activate vital support resources.  
   Regional emergency operations centers would need immediate and 
   effective telecommunication capabilities to rapidly organize and 
   coordinate support from elsewhere regionally, nationally, or 
   internationally. Public telecommunication resources are essential to 
   support these emergency activities. 
    
6.4 National operations 
    
   The most serious disaster events can impact national security of a 
   country. Therefore, immediate action is required by government 
   officials to organize and coordinate the highest level of emergency 
   support resources. With a serious threat to national security, 
   actions to ensure continuity of government must be initiated. These 
   types of activities need to not only have priority treatment for 
   emergency communications in the public telecommunications domain, 
   but they also require protection against eavesdropping of 
   confidential/sensitive information. In addition, locations of source 
   and destination of some critical national security traffic needs 
   protection. While these communications can often be supported 
   directly by dedicated government networks, public telecommunication 
   facilities provide an essential alternate capability. 
    
7. Conclusions 
    
   There are many critical requirements for emergency 
   telecommunications that need to be addressed as outlined above. 
   These are important ingredients to the total solution required for 
   effective and comprehensive emergency telecommunication capabilities 
   in a public Internet-based telecommunication service infrastructure. 
   Technical solutions are neither proposed nor suggested, so that full 
   consideration and innovation will be used in seeking effective 
   solutions. There are many other procedural, operational, policy, 
   regulatory, and full systems considerations that also need to be 
   addressed to ensure that the technical capabilities of Internet-
   based infrastructures are established and sound. 
    
8. Security Considerations 
    
   Detailed requirements are given in [5]. Authorized access, security 
   protection, and privacy are presented here as general security 
   requirements for emergency services in Section 2.
