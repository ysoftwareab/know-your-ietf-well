Abstract 
    
   This document presents a context transfer protocol that enables 
   authorized context transfers.  Context transfers allows better 
   support for node based mobility so that the applications running on 
   mobile nodes can operate with minimal disruption.  Key objectives are 
   to reducing latency, packet losses and avoid re-initiation of 
   signaling to and from the mobile node.

1. Introduction 
    
   "Problem Description: Reasons For Performing Context Transfers 
   between Nodes in an IP Access Network" [3374] defines the following 
   main reasons why Context Transfer procedures may be useful in IP 
   networks.   
    
     1) The primary motivation, as mentioned in the introduction, is the 
     need to quickly re-establish context transfer-candidate services 
     without requiring the mobile host to explicitly perform all 
     protocol flows for those services from scratch. 
      
     2) An additional motivation is to provide an interoperable solution 
     that works for any Layer 2 radio access technology. 
    
   Access Routers typically establish state in order to effect certain 
   forwarding treatments to packet streams belonging to nodes sharing 
   the access router.  For instance, an access router may establish an 
   AAA session state and a QoS state for a node's packet streams.  When 
   the link connecting a mobile node and the access router is bandwidth-
   constrained, the access router may maintain header compression state 
   on behalf of the mobile node.  When such a node moves to a different 
   access router, this state or context relocation during handover 
   provides many important benefits, including: 
    
     . Seamless operation of application streams.  The handover node 
        (i.e., the Mobile Node) does not need to re-establish its 
        contexts at the new access router 
    
     . Performance benefits.  When contexts need to be reestablished, 
        performance of transport protocols would suffer until the 
        contexts are in place.  For instance, when the required QoS 
        state is not present, a stream's packets would not receive the 
        desired per-hop behavior treatment, subjecting them to higher 
        likelihood of unacceptable delays and packet losses. 
    
     . Bandwidth savings.  Re-establishing multiple contexts over an 
        expensive, low-speed link can be avoided by relocating contexts 
        over a potentially higher-speed wire. 
    
     . Reduced susceptibility to errors, since much more of the 
        protocol operates over reliable networks, replacing 
        renegotiations over a potentially error-prone link. 
    
   In [3374], a detailed description of motivation, the need and 
   benefits of context transfer are outlined.  In this document, we 
   describe a generic context transfer protocol, which provides:

     .  Representation for feature contexts. 
      
     .  Messages to initiate and authorize context transfer, and notify 
        a mobile node of the status of the transfer. 
      
     .  Messages for transferring contexts prior to, during and after 
        handovers. 
    
   The proposed protocol is designed to work in conjunction with other 
   protocols in order to provide seamless mobility.

   one or more data packets.  Data packets may be bundled together in 
   order ensure a more efficient transfer.  The total packet size,

2.3 Message Types 
    
   Context Transfer Start Request (CTSR) Message 
    
     Sent by MN or nAR to pAR request start of context transfer.  It is 
     for further to study to see if when the CTSR message is sent by the 
     MN to the nAR, it should also be relayed to pAR). Acknowledgement 
     is optional, since if the CTSR message is sent by the MN, the MN 
     may have already moved and may not receive the reply. This message 
     may include a list of FPT (feature profile types) that require 
     transfer. It may include flags to request secure and/or reliable 
     transfer.  
       
   Context Transfer Initiate Ack (CTIN-Ack) Message

     Sent by nAR to pAR, showing nAR's readiness to accept MN's context. 
     This message is used when reliability is required. In other words, 
     if the reliability flag is set, this message must be sent. 
    
   Context Transfer Data (CTD) Message 
    
     Sent by pAR to nAR, and includes feature data (CTP data). This 
     message should handle predictive as well as normal CT. A 
     reliability flag included in this message indicates whether a reply 
     is required by nAR.  
    
   Context Transfer Data Reply (CTDR) Message  
    
     This message is sent by nAR to pAR depending on the value of the 
     reliability flag in CTD. Indicates success or failure. 
    
   Context Transfer Cancel (CTA) Message 
    
     Sent by nAR to pAR to cancel an ongoing CT process, for example 
     mobile node has moved, or nAR has waited too long for 
     retransmissions.

3. Timing and Trigger Considerations 
    
   Basic Mobile IP handover signaling can introduce disruptions to the 
   services running on top of Mobile IP, which may introduce unwanted 
   latencies that practically prohibit its use for many types of 
   services. Mobile IP latency and packet loss is being optimized 
   through several alternative procedures, such as Fast Mobile IP 
   [FMIPv6] and Low Latency Mobile IP [LLMIP].  
    
   Feature re-establishment through context transfer should contribute 
   zero (optimally) or minimally to the disruption of services in 
   conjunction to handovers. This means that the timing of context 
   transfer SHOULD be carefully aligned with basic Mobile IP handover 
   events, and with optimized Mobile IP handover signaling mechanisms, 
   as those protocols become more stable.

   In addition whenever possible, the context transfer procedure MUST 
   take measures to minimize the service disruption (packet loss) caused 
   by the context transfer procedure itself. This will be elaborated 
   further in the future updates of this draft. 
    
3.1 Starting Event 
    
   CT can be either started by a request from the MN or at the 
   initiative of new AR or pAR.  
    
     . MN can send the CT start request to old or new AR. The former is 
        preferred since the MN is expected to have more satisfactory 
        trust relationship with pAR than with nAR. Also sending the 
        request to nAR would add extra latency since the new AR, itself, 
        after processing the MN's request will need to request context 
        transmission from pAR. 
    
     . Either new AR or old AR may request or start (respectively) 
        context transfer based on internal or network triggers. 
    
   Here we prefer the following approach:  
    
   The MN will send a context transfer request to the old AR (including 
   proper authentication material). After checking authentication and if 
   the pAR has a trust relationship with nAR, the old AR starts the 
   context transfer procedure. 
    
4. Transport Considerations 
    
   It is not the intention of this work to define a new general-purpose 
   transport protocol.  In this section we outline the issues of running 
   CTP over well-known protocols. 
    
   A general note, however, on congestion control. ICMP and UDP do not 
   provide congestion control, while TCP/SCTP do provide congestion 
   control.  Congestion control may delay the transfer of context, but 
   do protect the network.  This trade off needs to be further studied 
   in terms of applicability of context transfer.  Some issues affecting 
   this will be the type of signaling - for example, intra-domain vs. 
   inter-domain.   
    
   Of the existing transport mechanisms, both TCP and SCTP provide 
   checksums. UDP provides only an optional checksum. In order to make 
   efficient use of multiplexing functionality of context transfer 
   protocol, the UDP checksum MUST be de-activated. This will decrease 
   the likelihood that the entire context data packet is dropped due to 
   individual feature data corruptions.

4.1 Congestion Control 
    
   Context transfer is essentially an optimization to enable smooth 
   handovers and to prevent the need of re-initializing signaling to and 
   from a mobile node after handover.  Context transfer takes place 
   between access routers.   
    
   The goal of congestion control is to prevent congestion by noting 
   packet loss at the transport layer and reducing the congestion 
   control window when packet loss occurs, thus effectively restricting 
   the available in-flight window for packet sending.  Additionally, TCP 
   & SCTP deploy slow-start mechanisms at start-up, in order to prevent 
   congestion problems at the start of a new TCP/SCTP session. 
    
   As some context is time-critical, delays due to congestion control 
   may reduce the performance of mobile nodes; additionally, signaling 
   from the mobile node may be increased if the context transfer of time 
   critical data fails.   
    
   Therefore, some analysis is needed on the role of congestion control 
   and context transfer.  Important considerations should be network-
   provisioning, intra-domain vs. inter-domain signaling as well as 
   other considerations.  A quick analysis follows. 
    
   It is assumed that intra-domain time-critical context transfer should 
   take approximately one kilobyte, based on existing implementation of 
   some context transfer solutions.   Contexts that are significantly 
   larger are assumed not so time critical. For a larger number of 
   users, say one thousand users requesting a smooth handover all in the 
   same second, the total bandwidth needed is still a small fraction of 
   a typical Ethernet or frame relay or ATM link between access routers.  
   So even bursty traffic will be fine. Additionally, physically 
   adjacent access routers should be with in one or two IP hops of each 
   other, so the effects of context transfer should be localized If 
   transferring real-time contexts triggers congestive errors, the 
   access network may be seriously under-provisioned.  
    
4.2 ICMP 
    
   Pros  
     . No explicit connection setup needed.

        if TCP connections are re-used.

        here. 
    
5. Open Issues 
    
   This section lists some open issues that need further discussion. 
    
5.1 Reliability 
    
 
 
Loughney                 Expires - April 2003                 [Page 9] 
                      Context Transfer Protocol          October 2002 
 
 
   Should reliability be handled at the transport layer?  Should the 
   reliability needs of contexts be handled at the CTP data level or CTP 
   message level?  How to handle multiple contexts to be transferred 
   with differing reliability needs. 
    
5.2 Transport  
    
   Currently, the issue of which transport protocol should be supported 
   is open.  
    
5.3 Failure Handling 
    
   Failure of Context Transfer should at least cause no harm to the 
   network or to the user session.  Failure reporting to the mobile node 
   may be needed. It is for further study how to handle failures of 
   context transfer.  
    
5.4 Zone of Operation 
    
   Currently, the authors are restricting discussion of CTP to intra-
   domain signaling.  Discussion of inter-domain signaling left for 
   later discussions. 
    
   Inter-domain signaling is more complicated.  For example, the 
   physically adjacent routers may be more than several IP hops away.  
   Additionally, provisioning inter-domain signaling links may be much 
   more complicated.   
    
   Restricting CTP to intra-domain signaling simplifies security, 
   transport and provision concerns.  Additionally, a restriction to 
   intra-domain signaling may help to ensure CT completes in sufficient 
   time to meet time sensitive requirements. 
    
6. Examples and Signaling Flows 
    
   To be added. 
    
7. Security Considerations 
    
   The Context Transfer Protocol essentially transfers state between 
   access routers.  If the mobile nodes are not authenticated and 
   authorized before moving on the network, there is a potential for 
   DoS-style attacks by bad guys trying to shift state between ARs, 
   causing network disruptions. 
    
   In general, CTP MUST rely on IETF standardized security mechanisms

   reasonable mechanisms for securing the context transfer between 
   access routers.  
    
   In order to avoid the introduction of additional latency to context 
   transfer due to the need for establishment of secure channel between 
   the context transfer peers (ARs), the two ARs SHOULD establish such 
   secure channel in advance. If IPSec is used, for example, the two AR 
   need to engage in a key exchange mechanisms such as IKE [IKE], 
   establish IPSec SAs, defining the keys, algorithms and IPSec 
   protocols (such as ESP) in anticipation for any upcoming context 
   transfer. This will save time during handovers that require secure 
   transfer of mobile node's context(s). Such SAs can be maintained and 
   used for all upcoming context transfers between the two ARs.  
   Security should be negotiated prior to the sending of context. 
    
   Furthermore, either one or both of the pAR and nAR need to be able 
   authenticate the mobile and authorize mobile's credential before 
   authorizing the context transfer and release of context to the 
   mobile. In case the context transfer is request by the MN, a 
   mechanism MSUT be provided so that requests are authenticated 
   (regardless of the security of context transfer itself) to prevent 
   the possibility of rouge MNs launching DoS attacks by sending large 
   number of CT requests as well as cause large number of context 
   transfers between ARs. 
    
   Another important consideration is that the mobile node should claim 
   it's own context, and not some other masquerader. One method to 
   achieve this is to provide an authentication cookie to be included 
   with the context transfer message sent from the pAR to the nAR and 
   confirmed by the mobile node at the nAR. 
    
8. IANA Considerations 
    
   This section provides guidance to the Internet Assigned Numbers 
   Authority (IANA) regarding registration of values related to the 
   Diameter protocol, in accordance with BCP 26 [IANA].   
    
   This document authorized IANA to create a registry for Context 
   Profile Types, introduced in this document.  For future Context 
   Profile Types, it is recommended that allocations be done on the 
   basis of Designated Expert. 
    
   The Context Profile Type introduced in this document requires IANA 
   Type Numbers for each set of feature contexts that make use of 
   Profile Types. 
    
   For registration requests where a Designated Expert should be 
   consulted, the responsible IESG area director should appoint the 
   Designated Expert.
