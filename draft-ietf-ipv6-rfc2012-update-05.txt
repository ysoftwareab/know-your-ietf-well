1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a
   MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in
   STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58,
   RFC 2580 [RFC2580].


2.  Overview

   The current TCP-MIB defined in this memo consists of two tables and
   a group of scalars:

   - The tcp group of scalars reports parameters and statistics of a
     TCP protocol engine.

   - The tcpConnectionTable provides access to status information for
     all TCP connections handled by a TCP protocol engine. In addition
     the table also reports identification of the operating system
     level processes which handle the TCP connections.

   - The tcpListenerTable provides access to information about all TCP
     listening endpoints known by a TCP protocol engine. And similar
     to the case of the connection table, the tcpListenerTable also 
     reports the identification of the operating system level
     processes which handle this listening TCP endpoint.

3.1 Relationship to Other MIBs

   This section discusses the relationship of this TCP-MIB module to
   other MIB modules.







Raghunarayan, Editor                                           [Page 6]

INTERNET-DRAFT               Expires: May 2004            November 2003


3.1.1 Relationship to RFC1213-MIB

   TCP related MIB objects were originally defined as part of the
   RFC1213-MIB defined in RFC 1213 [RFC1213]. The TCP related objects
   of the RFC1213-MIB were later copied into a separate MIB module and
   published in RFC 2012 [RFC2012] in SMIv2 format.

   The previous versions of the TCP-MIB both defined the tcpConnTable,
   which has been deprecated for basically two reasons:

   (1) The tcpConnTable only supports IPv4.

      The current approach in the IETF is to write IP version neutral
      MIBs rather than having different definitions for various
      version of IP. This reduces the amount of overhead when new
      objects are introduced since there is only one place to add
      them. Hence, the approach taken in RFC 2452 of having separate
      tables is not continued.

   (2) The tcpConnTable mixes listening endpoints with connections.

      It turns out that connections tend to have a different behaviour
      and management access pattern compared to listening endpoints.
      Splitting the original tcpConnTable into two tables thus allows
      for the addition of specific status and statistics objects for
      listening endpoints and connections.

3.1.2 Relationship to IPV6-TCP-MIB

   The IPV6-TCP-MIB defined in RFC 2452 has been moved to Historic
   since the approach of having separate IP version specific tables is
   not followed anymore. Implementation of RFC 2452 is thus not
   suggested anymore.

3.1.3 Relationship to HOST-RESOURCES-MIB and SYSAPPL-MIB

   The tcpConnectionTable and the tcpListenerTable report the
   identification of the operating system level process which handles
   a connection or a listening endpoint. The value is reported as an
   Unsigned32 which is expected to be the same as the hrSWRunIndex of
   the HOST-RESOURCES-MIB [RFC2790] (if the value is smaller than
   2147483647) or the sysApplElmtRunIndex of the SYSAPPL-MIB [RFC2287].
   This allows managment applications to identify the TCP connections
   that belong to an operating system level process which has proven
   to be valuable in operational environments.

            1. An application that is willing to accept both IPv4 and

               tcpListenerLocalAddressType of unknown (0) and 
               tcpListenerLocalAddress of ''h (a zero-length

            2. An application which is willing to accept only IPv4 or

               tcpListenerLocalAddressType of the appropriate address
               type and tcpListenerLocalAddress of ''h (a zero-length

            3. An application which is a listening for data destined
               only to a specific IP address, but from any remote 
               system, is represented by a tcpListenerLocalAddressType 
               of an appropriate address type, with 
               tcpListenerLocalAddress the specific local address.

            NOTE: The address type in this table represents the 
            address type used for the communication, irrespective 
            of the higher-layer abstraction.  For example, an 
            application using IPv6 'sockets' to communicate via

7.  Security Considerations

There are management objects defined in this MIB that have a
MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects may be considered
sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The support
for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

o The tcpConnectionState and tcpConnState objects have a MAX-ACCESS
  clause of read-write, which allows termination of an arbitrary
  connection.  Unauthorized access could cause a denial of service.


Raghunarayan, Editor                                          [Page 24]

INTERNET-DRAFT               Expires: May 2004            November 2003


Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
sensitivity/vulnerability:

o The tcpConnectionTable and the tcpConnTable contain objects
  providing information on the active connections on the device,
  the status of these connections and the associated processes.
  This information may be used by an attacker to launch attacks
  against known/unknown weakness in certain protocols/applications.

o The tcpListenerTable and the tcpConnTable contain objects providing
  information on listeners on an entity.  For e.g. the
  tcpListenerLocalPort and tcpConnLocalPort objects can be used 
  to identify what ports are open on the machine and can thus what 
  attacks are likely to succeed, without the attacker having to run a 
  port scanner.

SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
in this MIB module.

It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
authentication and privacy).

Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
