                         draft-turner-ccmib-00

Abstract

   This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
   community.  In particular, it describes managed objects used to
   manage key management implementations including asymmetric keys,
   symmetric keys, trust anchors, and cryptographic-related firmware.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
   community.  In particular, it describes managed objects used to
   manage key management implementations including asymmetric keys,
   symmetric keys, trust anchors, and cryptographic-related firmware.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in
   [RFC2578], [RFC2579], and [RFC2580].

   As with all MIB modules, an attempt to SET or CREATE an object to
   value that is not supported by the implementation will result in a
   failure using a return code that indicates that the value is not
   supported.

            "A value that represents a type of Internet address.

            Implementations must ensure that IPAddressType objects
            and any dependent objects (e.g. IPv4Address and IPv6Address
            objects) are consistent. An inconsistentValue error must
            be generated if an attempt to change an IPv4Address or
            IPv6Address object would, for example, lead to an undefined
            value. IPAddressType/IPv4Address and

            "Denotes a generic Internet address that is either IPv4 or
            IPv6.

            Every usage of the IPAddress textual convention is required
            to specify the IPAddressType object which provides the
            context. It is suggested that the IPAddressType object is
            logically registered before the object(s) which use the
            IPAddress textual convention if they appear in the same
            logical row.

            The value of an IPAddress object must always be consistent
            with the value of the associated IPAddressType object.
            Attempts to set an IPAddress object to a value which is
            inconsistent with the associated IPAddressType must
            fail with an inconsistentValue error.

           and inherent tagging information, truncated to 19 octets.
           With public key certificates, for example, a hash of the

            "This object signals the local device to perform actions on
            the available cryptographic device materials (CDMs) from a
            CDM server. The following types of actions are supported:

            [downloadAndInstall] = Initiates a download of a CDM. After
            a successful download, the CDM will be installed for local
            consumption and an entry is to be configured in the
            appropriate MIB table based on cCDMType:

            cCDMType          |  MIB Table Destination
            -------------------------------------
            (1) notification  |  N/A
            (2) symmetricKey  |  cSymmetricKeyTable
            (3) asymmetricKey |  cAsymKeyTable
            (4) certificate   |  cAsymKeyTable
            (5) cklOrCrl      |  cCKLTable
            (6) firmware      |  cFirmwareInformationTable

            [downloadAndStore] = Initiates a download of the CDM. After
            a successful download, an entry is created in the
            cCDMStoreTable to store the CDM.

            [discard] = Stops the current CDM delivery request and
            discards the CDM if potentially downloaded; this reverts the
            current value of the cCDMDeliveryStatus to 'complete'. If
            entries are created in the aforementioned tables for the
            install and store operations, these newly configured entries
            will be removed.

            The enumeration value of 'downloadAndStore' does not apply
            when cCDMType is set to 'notification'. 'downloadAndInstall'
            is used for a cCDMType of 'notification'.

            If this column is configured to any value except 'discard'
            while the value of cCDMDeliveryStatus is any value except
            'complete', the SNMP set operation must result in an
            inconsistentValue exception. The same applies if 'discard'
            is configured while the value cCDMDeliveryStatus is
            'complete'."

            storage of key material.

            was configured to either 'downloadAndStore' or
            'downloadAndInstall'.

           cSecPolicyRuleFilterReference). The value of this column can
           take one of four enumeration values.

           [1] protect: The 'protect' enumeration value indicates that
           the data traffic flow should be protected by a Secure
           Connection with attributes defined  by the associated filter
           (cSecPolicyRuleFilterReference).

           [10] bypass: The 'bypass' enumeration value indicates that
           the data traffic flow should be bypassed with no
           cryptographic protection/services provided.

           [20] discard: The 'discard enumeration value indicates that
           the data traffic flow, agnostic of their direction, should
           be discarded.

           [21] discardInbound: The 'discardInbound' enumeration value
           indicates that an inbound data traffic flow should be
           discarded.

           [22] discardOutbound: The 'discardOutbound' enumeration
           value indicates that an outbound data traffic flow should be
           discarded.

           Implementations that do not support the 'discardInbound' and
           'discardOutbound' enumeration values should return a
           wrongValue exception during a SET to the cSecPolicyRuleAction
           object.

6.  IANA Considerations

7.  Security Considerations

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS {RFC6353}.

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
