Abstract

   Today's Internet is suffering from reflection-type DoS/DDoS attacks,
   such as TCP SYN flood, Smurf attack, DNS reflection, etc.  These
   attacks often rely on the IP source address spoofing.  Current source
   address spoofing prevention methods have a coarse granularity, and
   the attackers can still in some cases launch reflection-type DoS/DDos
   attacks or other attacks while being difficult to trace.  Aiming to
   solve this problem, this document proposes a fine-granularity source
   address spoofing prevention method, which can prevent the attackers
   from forging source addresses that belong to the same edge network to
   send packets to somewhere outside the IPv6 edge network.  The
   proposed method includes source address authentication using session
   key and hash digest algorithms and replay attack prevention by
   combining a sequence number method with a timestamp method.

2.  Problem Statement

   The source address spoofing prevention approaches based on filtering
   (e.g. ingress filtering) can validate the source address in real-
   time.  Current approaches based on filtering, however, only validate
   the IP source address according to the network prefix, so these
   approaches cannot prevent IP source address spoofing within edge
   network.  Thus, they leave some room to launch reflection-type DoS/
   DDoS attacks and make traceback uncertain.  For instance, if the
   Internet were to deploy ingress filtering on a large scale, an
   attacker would be prevented from forging an IP source address
   belonging to any other edge network, defeating most reflection-type
   DoS/DDoS attacks.  However, even with ingress filtering [RFC2827],
   the attacker can still forge an IP source address that belongs to the
   same edge network and attack the victim using the reflection-type
   DoS/DDoS.  This type attack scenario is shown in Fig.1:

   This type of security threat may be more serious in IPv6 networks,
   because the IPv6 edge network may be much larger than in IPv4.  In
   this situation, the ingress filtering may be insufficient and a fine
   granularity source address spoofing prevention method needs to be
   developed.  For this purpose, this document proposes a suite of

   mechanisms to prevent source address spoofing in the edge network.

   The edge network this document addresses is the network behind the
   first 3-layer device (router, 3-layer switch, etc.).  The edge
   network uses the border 3-layer device to communicate with other
   networks.  This document aims to prevent source address spoofing when
   the host in the edge network sends packets to somewhere outside this
   edge network.  In addition, replay attacks are handled.  If only
   forged IP source addresses can be identified, a replay packet can
   still be sent to somewhere outside the edge network since its source
   address is valid.  Therefore, identifying packets with forged source
   addresses anti-replay attack defense are two essential components of
   an integrated source address spoofing prevention method.

3.  Related Work

   Current work on security problems in edge networks is concentrated on
   access control, such as IEEE 802.1x [IEEE-802-1x], NAC [NAC], NAP
   [NAP] and TNC [TNC].

   IEEE 802.1x is a standard for port-based network access control,
   which provides authenticated network access to 802.11 wireless
   networks and to wired Ethernet networks.  The authentication of
   802.1x simply controls the enabling of a switch port and in some
   cases the allocation of a VLAN.  If the user with the legitimate
   account and password accesses the network, the corresponding switch
   port will be enabled for transit.  If the user does not have the
   legitimate account and password or there is no user to access the
   network, the corresponding switch port will stay closed. 802.1x uses
   EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) [RFC3748] to carry out its
   authentication process.  EAP is an authentication framework which
   supports multiple authentication methods.  EAP typically runs
   directly over data link layers such as IEEE 802, without requiring
   IP.

   NAC (Network Admission Control) is proposed by Cisco.  NAC ensures
   that the access hosts are compliant with the security policies.  Any
   noncompliant hosts cannot access the network, and they will be
   isolated until brought into compliance.

   NAP (Network Access Protection) is another security access mechanism
   proposed by Microsoft.  NAP platform provides a suite of integrity-
   checking methods to check the 'healthy' state of access hosts.  Hosts
   that do not conform policies defining end-host security stance cannot
   access the network, and will be placed in quarantine until they are
   compliant.

   TNC (Trusted Network Connection) is a framework of trusted network
   connection supported by about 60 members of TCG (Trusted Computing
   Group) [TCG].  TNC provides user identity authentication, host trust
   level validation and network accessibility control on the various
   trust levels of end systems.

   These techniques mentioned above are all used to control hosts'
   access to the network.  These techniques range from the simplest,
   802.1x, that simply controls access through a switch port to more
   complex offerings such as NAC, NAP and TNC, that offer more
   complicated network access controls such as security policy
   enforcement, etc.

   All of these techniques only have effect when hosts try to access the
   network.  Once the host accesses the network successfully, the

   subsequent packets sent from this host are typically unauthenticated,
   and source IP address spoofing becomes possible.  Therefore, in the
   field of edge network security, it is not sufficient simply to ensure
   that the access process is secure.  In order to defeat reflection-
   type DoS/DDoS attacks mentioned in the problem statement Section, it
   is necessary to validate every packet originating in the edge network
   and prevent the source IP address spoofing in the edge network.

4.  The Solution

4.1.  Overview

   This document proposes a fine-granularity source address spoofing
   prevention method, which can prevent the attackers from forging
   source address that belongs to the same edge network to send packets
   to somewhere outside the IPv6 edge network.  In this approach, if the
   attacker sends packets to somewhere outside the edge network by
   forging the IP address of another host or replays the victim's
   packets, these malicious packets will be filtered.  Moreover, the
   method can work with other effective but coarser-granularity methods
   such as ingress filtering or SPM[Bre05] to form a multi-fence defense
   architecture for the next generation Internet.

   The main idea is that: we deploy a security gateway to carry out the
   authentication algorithm as shown in Figure 1.  The authentication
   algorithm includes two main mechanisms: the source address validation
   mechanism which verifies the source address using a session key a
   hash digest algorithm (such as MD5, SHA-1, etc.), and the anti-replay
   mechanism which combines the sequence number method with the
   timestamp method.

                    Figure 2:  The deployment scenario

   Initially, each host in the edge network needs to be authenticated by
   the security gateway.  This action also binds the host's IP address
   and its session key which is shared by the host and the security
   gateway.  If the access authentication succeeds, each packet sent to
   somewhere outside the edge network will carry a signature.  Then, the
   packet passes through the source address validation and the anti-
   replay check of the security gateway.  If both these verifications
   succeed, the packet will be forwarded to the edge 3-layer device of
   the edge network; otherwise, the packet will be dropped.

   The approach mainly includes the following steps:

   1.  When a host wants to access the Internet, it should firstly carry
   out the access authentication.  This process can use the existing
   access authentication mechanism such as RADIUS [RFC2865]Kerberos
   [RFC1510], etc.

   2.  The host generates a session key and sends it to the security
   gateway via some key exchange mechanisms such as IKE [RFC2409], IKE2
   [RFC4306].  The security gateway binds the session key and the host's
   IP address.

   3.  When the host sends packets to somewhere outside the edge
   network, it needs to generate one signature for each packet using the
   hash digest algorithm.  The signature is carried in a new IPv6
   extension header, named 'source address validation header'.

   4.  The security gateway authenticates the signature carried in the
   packet to validate the source address.

   5.  The security gateway identifies the replay packets by checking
   whether the timestamp of the packet is expired and the sequence
   number of the packet is increasing.

   In above steps, network access authentication and the key exchange
   mechanisms can use the existing approaches.  Next, this document
   mainly discusses the source address validation algorithm and the
   anti-replay algorithm.

4.2.  The Source address validation algorithm

   This document chooses the algorithm which verifies the source address
   using the session key and hash digest algorithm (such as MD5, SHA-1,
   etc.) as the authentication method.  In this algorithm, the host
   certifies its ownership of a certain IP address via showing the
   security gateway its secret session key which is shared with the
   security gateway as shown inFigure 3.

    Figure 3:  The authentication process of source address validation

   The authentication process shown in Figure 3 is as follows:

   1.  Host A sends a packet M to the security gateway B. M carries a
   signature H[M||S] which is computed by the hash digest function using
   the session key S and the certain part of the packet M (source
   address, timestamp, sequence number, etc.) as the input.

   2.  When the security gateway B receives the packet M, B can re-
   compute the hash value HB according to the packet M, since B also
   knows the session key S. If HB is equal to the signature H [M||S]
   carried in the packet M, the security gateway B can confirm that the
   packet has a valid source address; Otherwise, B can conclude that the
   packet's source address is forged and then drops it.

4.3.  The Anti-replay Algorithm

   Our anti-replay algorithm combines the timestamp method and the
   sequence number method.  Both the timestamp method and the sequence
   number method are prevailing anti-replay algorithms.  The timestamp
   method works as follows: when the host A sends a packet M to the
   security gateway, the packet M is marked with a timestamp Ta, which
   represents the sending time of the packet M. Once the security
   gateway receives the packet M, it reads its local time Tb.  If |Tb-
   Ta|>T, where T is the admission time window, the security gateway can
   conclude that the packet M is a replay of a previoualy-sent packet
   and drops it.  However, it is hard to synchronize the clocks of the
   host and the gateway exactly.  Moreover, network latency is
   uncertain.  Therefore, the admission time window T is always larger

Internet-Draft     SAVA Solution for IPV6 Edge Network         June 2007


   than the real transmission time of the packet.  This feature could
   make the timestamp method insecure for anti-replay.  When |Tb-Ta| is
   less than T, the packet should be a non-replay one.  But afterwards,
   if the replay packet is received in the margin time (T-|Tb-Ta|), the
   security gateway will incorrectly regard it as a normal packet.

   The main idea behind the sequence number method is: when the host A
   sends packets to the security gateway, each packet carries an
   incremental sequence number.  If the latest packet's sequence number
   is greater than the previous one, the packet is normal; otherwise,
   the packet is a replay.  This method requires the packets coming in
   order.  If the packets come out of order, one can employ a sequence
   number window to deal with it, as with IPSec.  Out-of-sequence
   arrival of packets is mainly due to the load balancing policy or
   queuing in routers or other 3-layer devices.  This document deals
   with the situation behind the first 3-layer device, thus we can
   assume that the packets sending to security gateway from hosts in the
   edge network are always in order.  (Or at the very least, out-of-
   sequence arrival is so rare that the rate of packet discard due to
   sequence error is low compared to other causes of packet loss)
   However, even though the packets come in order, this method may not
   identify some replay packets when the sequence number is used in a
   cycle way.  For example, assuming the length of the sequence number
   is 16 bits, once the sequence number reaches the maximum 65535, it
   will return to 0 and increase as the previous cycle.  In this case,
   if the attacker keeps a packet of the nth cycle and replays it in the
   (n+1) th cycle, the security gateway will not identify the replay
   packet.

   In order to overcome the drawbacks of the timestamp and sequence
   method, we combine these two methods to prevent the replay attack.
   The timestamp method can use the sequence number mechanism to
   identify the replay packets in the admission time window T, and the
   sequence method can avoid the confusion between the normal and the
   replay packet by limiting the period of the sequence number cycle
   within the admission time window T.

5.  IPv6 Source Address Validation Header

   This approach utilizes a new IPv6 extension header to carry the
   signature, the sequence number and other useful information.  We call
   this new extension header 'source address validation header'.

   The format of the extension header is shown in Figure 4:

   o  Next Header: 8-bit.  Indicate either the type of the next
      extension header or the protocol type of the payload (TCP/UDP).

   o  Payload Len: 8-bit.  Length of the source address validation
      header in 8-octet units, not including the first 8 octets.

   o  Algorithm: 8-bit.  Point out the hash digest algorithm.  For
      example, MD5 is set to 1.

   o  Reserved: 8-bit.  Reserved for future use.  Zero on transmit.

   o  Timestamp: 32-bit.  It is used for anti-replay as described above.

   o  Sequence Number: 32-bit.  It is used for anti-replay as described
      above.

   o  Authentication Data: 128 bits if using MD5 as the hash digest
      algorithm.  The authentication data is computed by the hash digest

      algorithm.  The input of the hash digest algorithm includes: IPv6
      source address, timestamp, sequence number and session key.

   The usage of IPv6 source address validation header is as follows:

   1.  Each packet sent to somewhere outside the edge network needs to
   carry a source address validation header.  The header is inserted
   after the IPv6 header and before all the other extension headers.

   2.  The security gateway conducts the following verifications when
   receiving the packet:

   -Drop the packet directly if there is no source address validation
   header in the packet.

   -Check the authentication data in the source address validation
   header as described above.  Drop the packet if the check is failed.

   -Confirm that the timestamp is not expired and the sequence number is
   greater than the previous.  If that is not true, drop the packet.

   3.  If the whole process in the step 2 goes well, the security
   gateway needs to remove the source address validation header from the
   packet.  Considering the partial deployment, if we don't remove the
   source address validation header, the hosts in other edge network may
   drop the packet due to misunderstanding of the new extension header.
   This step is unnecessary if our approach has been globally deployed.

6.  Performance and Effectiveness Evaluation

   The performance is a primary requirement of any source address
   validation mechanism.  In our approach, this requirement reduces to
   the question of whether the performance of the hash digest algorithm
   is sufficient.  Experimental result show that the performance of MD5
   is about 1.63 Gbps (204.346MB/s * 8),which is evaluated in the
   platform of Intel P4 2.0G CPU and 512M memory.  This performance can
   meet the requirements of most edge networks.  We should note that
   this result is derived from the MD5 algorithm being implemented in
   the software.  If we implement the MD5 algorithm using hardware, we
   will get higher performance.  We conclude therefore, that the source
   address validation algorithm in our approach is completely feasible.

   In order to testify the effectiveness of our anti-replay algorithm
   which integrates timestamp and sequence number methods, we conducted
   several experiments to compare the effects of the timestamp, sequence
   number and our anti-replay algorithm.  The experiments show that the
   effectiveness of timestamp method seriously relies on the size of
   admission time window T. As the margin of the admission time window T
   is increased, the effectiveness of the timestamp method decreases.
   In the experiment to test effectiveness of the sequence number
   method, the accuracy of replay packets identification in the (n+1)th
   sequence number increasing cycle is linear with the packet number
   recorded in the nth sequence number increasing cycle.  The
   experimental result shows that almost all packets recorded can be
   replayed successfully under conditions of persistent replay.  We
   repeated the above two simulation experiments to test the
   effectiveness of our anti-replay algorithm which integrates the
   timestamp and the sequence number methods.  Even though the admission
   time window T has a large margin, with the help of sequence number
   method, all replay packets are identified successfully.  In the
   (n+1)th sequence number increasing cycle, when attacker replays the
   packets recorded in the nth sequence number increasing cycle, the
   security gateway can identify nearly 100% replay packets since the
   intervals between replay packets and normal packets exceed the
   admission time window T.

   Our experiments show that the source address validation algorithm
   this document proposed prevent the attackers from forging source
   address that belongs to the same edge network to send packets to
   somewhere outside the IPv6 edge network effectively.  The anti-replay
   algorithm this document proposed can overcome the shortcomings of
   both timestamp and sequence number methods, and form a more
   effective, fine-grain anti-replay mechanism.

7.  An Application Case

   Multihoming to upstream ISPs is increasingly common in the Internet.
   Multihoming refers to the phenomenon that one edge network accesses
   to the Internet through multiple upstream ISPs.  In the multihoming
   environment, a host in the edge network may have several ISP-assigned
   IP addresses and the edge network may have several outbound links to
   different ISPs, which makes the source address spoofing prevention
   complicated.  This document proposes a solution for the multihoming
   scenario as shown in Figure 5.

   In our solution, each edge router of the edge network is equipped
   with a security gateway.  Each security gateway is responsible for
   handling the addresses assigned from the ISP to which that security
   gateway is attached.  For example, in Figure 5, the security gateway
   A just handles the addresses assigned from ISP A. Other than this,
   the security gateway performs the same functions as the single-homed
   situation described above.

   Another problem is that the security gateway may be confused in the
   multihoming situation since outbound packets are routed by the
   destination address.  For example, in Figure 5, when host A sends
   packets using the addresses based on prefix A (PrefixA:PrefSite:
   hostA) as the source addresses, the packets could be sent to the edge
   router B connected to ISP B, and the security gateway B will be
   confused and take the wrong action.  In order to solve this problem,
   packets originating in the edge network are passed through a source
   routing domain (shown in Figure 5) to which all edge routers are
   connected.  These routers would choose a route based on the
   destination and source addresses of a packet, selecting the
   appropriate edge router for the given source address.  In this way,
   our source address spoofing prevention method can work well in the
   multihoming scenario.
