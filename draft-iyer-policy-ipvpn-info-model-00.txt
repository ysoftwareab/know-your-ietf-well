Abstract 
    
   This document represents the object oriented information model for 
   representing policy information associated with provisioning IP VPN 
   services such as firewall, address translation, quality of service, 
   encryption. This draft extends the core policy information model to 
   cover the policies that need to be enforced to configure IP VPN 
   services mentioned earlier. The information model defined in this 
   document is independent of any implementation specifics related to 
   the repository used to store the policy information.

   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [2].

1. Introduction 
    
   The term IP VPN is used to denote VPN services delivered over an 
   IP network. The goal of IP VPN provisioning is to align the network 
   elements to provide consistent treatment to selected pieces of IP 
   traffic. The network elements will require a combination of 
   capabilities depending largely on their location in the topology and 
   the technology being used. The classification and treatment of the 
   traffic should be technology independent. However the models 
   described in this document will lend themselves to easier 
   implementation over certain standardized technologies in each of the 
   traffic treatment areas. 
    
   The IP VPN policy information model is based on the Policy 
   Framework Core Information Model [PCIM]. The core model has been 
   extended to address the requirement that network elements deliver 
   the services required by the network user. The network elements 
   receive their configuration in the form of policies. The policies 
   are stored and distributed using the policy framework described in 
   [PFRAME]. 
    
   The IP VPN policy information model references classes from the 
   Policy Framework Core Information Model [PCIM], the QoS Policy 
   Information Model [QOSIM] and the IPSEC Configuration Policy 
   Model [IPSECIM]. The corresponding LDAP implementations could be 
   built based on the Policy Framework LDAP Core Schema [PCIM-LDAP] 
   and QoS Policy Schema[QOSIM-LDAP] implementations. 
    
   This document is organized as follows: 
    
   1. Section 2 provides a quick introduction to the Unified Modeling 
      Language(UML) graphical notation used in this document 
   2. Section 3 defines the inheritance hierarchy in the context of the 
      policy core information model 
   3. Section 4 defines the containment hierarchy in the context of the 
      policy core information model 
   4. Section 5 provides an overview of the IP VPN policy definition 
      and introduces the condition and action classes for IP VPN 
      policies 
   5. Section 6 revisits the Policy Rule class[PCIM]. 
   6. Section 7 provides details on the policy condition classes and 
      their attributes 
   7. Section 8 provides details on the policy action classes and their 
      attributes 
   8. Section 9 explains the policy selection process which extends the 
      selection model described in the policy core information model 
   9. Section 10 deals with extending the IP VPN policy schema

2. UML Notation 
 
   The information model is presented in this document using UML 
   notation since it a well accepted standard and provides a task 
   independent way to model systems. 
    
   1. Boxes represent classes 
   2. A "o" denotes an aggregation. An aggregation is essentially a 
      reference. 
   3. A "x" denotes containment. A contained object is owned entirely 
      by the container. 
   4. The association line may be annotated with "multiplicity" which 
      indicates the number of objects aggregated or contained. 
      - a range of the form "a..b" indicates the minimum and maximum 
        number of objects 
      - an asterisk "*" indicates any number of objects

5. Container Classes 
    
   5.1 PolicyRepository[PCIM] 
    
   This class represents the physical policy repository. It is defined 
   in [PCIM]. 
    
   5.2 PolicyGroup[PCIM] 
    
   This class is a base class for the IPVPN policy lists. The class is 
   defined in [PCIM]. 
    
   5.3 IPVPNPolicyDomain 
    
   The policy domain represents an integral policy database. Policy 
   objects within the domain do not have references to any objects 
   outside of the domain.

   5.4 IPVPNAdminstrationPolicyList 
    
   The list of policies that apply to the administration of the policy 
   domain. The administration policies are not defined in this 
   document, but need to be defined in a future draft. The Security 
   Policy Specification Language [SPSL] serves as a good data point 
   for defining the administration policy schema.

                        which need to be enforced on the traffic by

   5.7 IPVPN 
    
   The IPVPN represents the IPVPN policy set that is to be applied to 
   the traffic. This is a first pass classification that decides the 
   IPVPN membership for the traffic.  
   A possible future modification of the IPVPN class is that it can be 
   nested within a larger IPVPN. When nested, the IPVPN cannot contain 
   policylists.

                        MPLSSecurityAction 
    
   8.8.1 The property MPLSSecurityAction 
    
   The property is MPLSSecurityAction is a reference to an instance of 
   a SecurityAssociationAction object to be defined under the MPLS 
   policy specification. It is anticipated that a policy information 
   model for MPLS configuration will soon be available. The definition 
   of the SecurityAssociationAction includes the information required 
   to setup an LSP(Label Switched Path) to provide the traffic with the 
   required security and level of service. In a practical enforcement 
   scenario the policy conditions will result in a FEC(Forward 
   Equivalence Class) and the MPLSSecurityAction will result in the LSP 
   being setup. The action could include the signaling 
   protocol(RSVP/CR-LDP) to be used, constraint based routing 
   directives, traffic engineering parameters. There will be a 
   potential overlap with the QoS actions specified earlier. 
 
    
9    Policy Decision Process 
    
   The policy decision process consists of the following steps : 
    
   Step 1 
    
        Identify the User characteristics of the traffic if possible 
        Identify the Network characteristics of the traffic 
         
   Step 2 
    
        Match the PolicyTagConditions for User and Network 
        characteristics to determine the IPVPN 
         
   Step 3 
    
        Within the IPVPN match the SourceNetworkConditions, 
        DestNetworkConditions, UserConditions, ApplicationConditions, 
        TimePeriodConditions to determine the policy that matches 
    
   Step 4 
    
        Use the action list to decide on the actions that need to be 
        enforced on the traffic 
    
                          
    
10   Extending the IPVPN Policy Schema 
    
   The IPVPN policy schema can be extended to adapt to the changing 
   landscape of technologies and classification criteria. It is 
   anticipated that the following areas will be extended more often 
   than the others

   1. PolicyTag 
      The policy tag sub classes may be extended to include new schemes 
      of identifying a network as well as new applications.  
      The Application tag is an abstract class and needs to be extended 
      with protocol specific filters 
       
   2. PolicyAction 
      The policy action class may be extended to include new possible 
      actions that can be added to support new IP services or better 
      implementations of existing IP services.
