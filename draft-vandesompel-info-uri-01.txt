   1  Introduction  
           
      This document defines the "info" Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) 
      scheme for information assets that have identifiers in public 
      namespaces that are not part of the URI allocation. By information 
      asset this document intends any information construct û i.e. any 
      abstraction, manifestation or performance, whether digital or 
      physical - that has identity within a public namespace. 
    
      There exist many information assets with identifiers in public 
      namespaces that are not referenceable by URI schemes. Examples of 
      such namespaces include Dewey Decimal Classifications [DEWEY], 
      Library of Congress Control Numbers [LCCN], NISO Serial Item and 
      Contribution Identifiers [SICI], NASA Astrophysics Data System 
      Bibcodes [BIBCODE], and National Library of Medicine PubMed 
      identifiers [PMID]. Other candidate namespaces include Publisher Item 
      Identifiers [PII], Online Computer Library Center OCLC Numbers 
      [OCLCNUM], and NISO OpenURL Framework identifiers [OFI] amongst 
      others.  
       
      The "info" URI scheme facilitates the referencing of information 
      assets that have identifiers in such public namespaces by means of 
      URIs. When referencing an information asset by means of its "info" 
      URI, the asset SHALL be considered a "resource" as defined in RFC 
      2396 [RFC2396] and SHALL enjoy the same common syntactic, semantic 
      and shared language benefits that the URI presentation confers. As 
      such, the "info" URI scheme enables public namespaces that are not 
      part of the URI allocation to be represented within the allocation. 
      The "info" URI scheme thus provides a bridging mechanism to allow 
      public namespaces to become part of the URI allocation. 
       
      Namespaces declared under the "info" URI scheme are regulated by an 
      "info" Registry mechanism. The "info" Registry allows a public 
      namespace that is not part of the URI allocation to be declared in a 
      registration process by the organization that manages it (the 
      Namespace Authority). The "info" Registry supports the declaration of 
      public namespaces that are not part of the URI allocation in a manner 
      that facilitates the construction of URIs for information assets 
      without imposing the burdens of independent URI registration and 
      maintenance of resource representations on the Namespace Authority. 
      Information assets identified within a registered namespace SHALL be

      added or deleted according to the business processes of the Namespace 
      Authority, and yet MAY be referenced within network applications via 
      the "info" URI in an open, standardized way without additional action 
      on the part of the Namespace Authority. 
       
      The "info" URI scheme exists for identification purposes alone.  
      Implementations MUST NOT assume that an "info" URI can be 
      dereferenced to a representation of the resource identified by the 
      URI. Applications of the "info" URI scheme are limited to the 
      identification of information assets and the declaration of rules for 
      comparing identity of such information assets regardless of whether 
      any services relating to such information assets are accessible on 
      the Internet. 
       
   2  Terminology 
       
      In this document the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHALL", "SHALL 
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "MAY", and "MAY NOT" are to be 
      interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and indicate 
      requirement levels for compliant implementations.  
       
   3  Application of the "info" URI Scheme 
       
      Public namespaces that are used for the identification of information 
      assets, and that are not part of the URI allocation, MAY be 
      registered as namespaces within the "info" Registry. Namespace 
      Authorities MAY register these namespaces in the "info" Registry, 
      thereby making these namespaces available to applications that need 
      to reference information assets by means of a URI. Registrations of 
      public namespaces that are not part of the URI allocation by parties 
      other than the Namespace Authority SHALL NOT be permitted, thereby 
      insuring against hostile usurpation or inappropriate usage of 
      registered service marks or the public namespaces of others.  
       
      Registration under the "info" Registry of a public namespace that is 
      not part of the URI allocation implies no particular functionalities 
      of the identifiers from the registered namespace other than the 
      identification of information assets. No resolution mechanisms are 
      associated with the "info" URI scheme, though for any particular 
      namespace there MAY exist mechanisms for resolving identifiers to 
      network services. The definition of such services falls outside the 
      scope of the "info" URI scheme. Registration does not define 
      namespace-specific semantics for identifiers within a registered 
      namespace, though allowable character sets and normalization rules 
      are specified in sections 5 and 6 so as to ensure that the URIs 
      created using such identifiers are compliant with applications that 
      use URIs.

      The registration of a public namespace in the "info" Registry SHALL 
      NOT preclude further development of services associated with that 
      namespace which MAY qualify the namespace for additional publication 
      elsewhere within the URI allocation. 
    
   4  The "info" Registry 
       
      The "info" Registry provides a mechanism for the registration of 
      public namespaces that are used for the identification of 
      information assets, and that are not part of the URI allocation.  
       
      NISO [NISO], the National Information Standards Organization, will 
      act as the Maintenance Agency for the "info" Registry, and will 
      delegate the day-to-day operation of the "info" Registry to a 
      Registry Operator. As the Maintenance Agency, NISO will ensure that 
      the Registry Operator operates the "info" Registry in accordance with 
      a publicly articulated policy document established under NISO 
      governance and made available on the "info" website <http://info-
      uri.info/>. The "info" Registry policy defines a review process for 
      candidate namespaces and provides measures of quality control and 
      suitability for entry of namespaces.  
    
   4.1 Management Characteristics of the "info" Registry 
       
      The "info" Registry will be managed according to policies established 
      under the auspices of NISO. All such policies, as well as the 
      namespace declarations in the "info" Registry, will be public. 
       
   4.2 Functional Characteristics of the "info" Registry 
       
      The "info" Registry will be publicly accessible and will support 
      discovery (by both humans and machines) of: 
       
          . string literals identifying the namespaces  
          . names and contact information of Namespace Authorities 
          . syntax requirements for identifiers maintained in such 
             namespaces 
          . normalization methodology for identifiers maintained in such 
             namespaces 
          . ancillary documentation 
    
      where the Registry entries refer to the corresponding "namespace" and 
      "identifier" components which are defined in the ABNF given in 
      section 5.1 of this document. 
       
   4.3 Maintenance of the "info" Registry 
       
      The public namespaces that MAY be registered in the "info" Registry 
      will be those of interest to the communities served by NISO and

      therefore NISO is committed to act as Maintenance Authority for the 
      "info" Registry, and to assign a Registry Operator to operate it on a 
      day-to-day basis. 
       
      NISO, a non-profit association accredited by the American National 
      Standards Institute (ANSI), identifies, develops, maintains, and 
      publishes technical standards to manage information in the digital 
      environment. NISO standards apply technologies to the full range of 
      information-related needs, including retrieval, re-purposing, 
      storage, metadata, and preservation. 
       
      Founded in 1939, incorporated as a not-for-profit education 
      association in 1983, and assuming its current name the following 
      year, NISO draws its support from the communities it serves. The 
      leaders of over 70 organizations in the fields of publishing, 
      libraries, IT and media serve as its voting members. Hundreds of 
      experts and practitioners serve on NISO committees and as officers of 
      the association.  
       
      NISO has been designated by ANSI to represent US interests to the 
      International Organization for Standardization's (ISO) Technical 
      Committee 46 on Information and Documentation. 
       
      The NISO headquarters office is located at: 4733 Bethesda Ave., 
      Bethesda, MD 20814, USA. (For further information, see the NISO

   5  The "info" URI Scheme 
           
   5.1 Definition of "info" URI Syntax 
     
      Note: RFC 2396, "Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax" 
      [RFC2396] is being revised [2396BIS] at the time of this writing. The 
      syntax used in this document follows the revisions made to the 
      generic URI syntax defined in RFC 2396 [2396BIS]. 
           
      The "info" URI syntax presented in this document is generally 
      conformant with the generic URI syntax defined in RFC 2396 [RFC2396]. 
      The only point of departure is to make use of the new "segment" 
      production as generalized in the revision to RFC 2396 [2396BIS]. This 
      specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of 
      RFC 2234 [RFC2234] to define the URI. The following core ABNF 
      productions are used by this specification as defined by Section 6.1 
      of RFC 2234: ALPHA, DIGIT, HEXDIG. 
       
      The "info" URI syntax is presented in two parts. Part A contains 
      productions specific to the "info" URI scheme, while Part B contains 
      generic productions from the RFC 2396 revision [2396BIS] which are

      repeated here both for completeness and for reference. (Although the 
      work on revising RFC 2396 is currently ongoing we expect that the 
      productions presented here will coincide with the final outcome of 
      that work. Nevertheless this BNF is complete in itself.) The 
      following set of productions (Part A) are specific to the "info" URI 
      scheme: 
    
      ; Part A: 
      ; productions specific to the "info" URI scheme 
       
        info-URI        = info-scheme ":" info-identifier [ "#" fragment ] 
    
        info-scheme     = "info"  
       
        info-identifier = namespace "/" identifier   
    
        namespace       = scheme 
       
        identifier      = path-segments 
    
      Note that the "info-identifier" production is a restriction on the 
      "rel-path" branch of the "hier-part" production in the RFC 2396 
      revision [2396BIS]. Further note that relative URI forms for "info" 
      URIs SHOULD NOT be allowed. 
       
      This next set of productions (Part B) are generic productions 
      reproduced from the RFC 2396 revision [2396BIS]: 
       
      ; Part B: 
      ; generic productions from the RFC 2396 revision [2396BIS] 
       
        scheme          = ALPHA *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "-" / "." ) 
       
        path-segments   = segment *( "/" segment ) 
       
        segment         = *pchar 
       
        fragment        = *( pchar / "/" / "?" ) 
       
        pchar           = unreserved / escaped / ";" / 
                          ":" / "@" / "&" / "=" / "+" / "$" / "," 
       
        unreserved      = ALPHA / DIGIT / mark 
       
        escaped         = "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG 
       
        mark            = "-" / "_" / "." / "!" / "~" / "*" / "'" / 
                          "(" / ")"

                           The "info" URI Scheme           December 2003 
    
    
      An "info" URI has an "info-identifier" as its scheme-specific part 
      and MAY take an optional "fragment" component. An "info-identifier" 
      is constructed by appending an "identifier" component to a 
      "namespace" component separated by a slash "/" character. The "info" 
      URI scheme supports hierarchy as indicated by the presence of the 
      slash "/" character. The intent of any slash "/" character within the 
      "identifier" component SHALL be construed as representing a hierarchy 
      delimiter, regardless of the intent of that character in the original 
      namespace. 
        
      Values for the "namespace" component of the "info" URI are name 
      tokens composed of URI scheme characters only (cf. the "scheme" 
      production). They identify the public namespace in which the 
      (unescaped) value for the "identifier" component originates, and are 
      registered in the "info" Registry, which guarantees their uniqueness. 
      Although the "namespace" component is case-insensitive, the canonical 
      form is lowercase and documents that specify values for the 
      "namespace" component MUST do so using lowercase letters. An 
      implementation SHOULD accept uppercase letters as equivalent to 
      lowercase in "namespace" names, for the sake of robustness, but 
      SHOULD only generate lowercase "namespace" names, for consistency. 
       
      Values for the "identifier" component of the "info" URI are 
      hierarchical strings composed of path segments of path segment 
      characters (cf. the "pchar" production), the segments being separated 
      by slash "/" characters. In their originating public namespace, the 
      (unescaped) values for the "identifier" component identify 
      information assets. The values for the "identifier" component MUST be 
      %-escaped as required by this syntax. The "identifier" component MUST 
      be treated as case-sensitive, although the "info" Registry MAY record 
      the case-sensitivity of identifiers from within particular registered 
      public namespaces. The "info" Registry MAY also disclose additional 
      normalization rules regarding the treatment of punctuation characters 
      and the like. 
       
      Values for the "fragment" component of the "info" URI are strings 
      composed of path segment characters (cf. the "pchar" production) plus 
      the slash "/" character and the question-mark "?" character. No 
      semantic role is assigned to the the slash "/" character and the 
      question-mark "?" character within the "fragment" component. The 
      (unescaped) values for the "fragment" component identify secondary 
      information assets with respect to the primary information asset 
      which is referenced by the "info-identifier". The values for the 
      "fragment" component MUST be %-escaped as required by this syntax. 
      The "fragment" component MUST be treated as case-sensitive. 
       
   5.2 Allowed Characters Under the "info" URI Scheme

      The "info" URI syntax uses the same set of allowed US-ASCII 
      characters as specified in RFC 2396 [RFC2396] for a generic URI. An 
      "info" URI string SHOULD be represented as a UNICODE [UNICODE] string 
      and be encoded in UTF-8 [RFC2279] form. Reserved characters as well 
      as excluded US-ASCII characters and non-US-ASCII characters MUST be 
      %-escaped before forming the URI. Details of the %-escape encoding 
      can be found in RFC 2396, section 2.4. 
           
   5.3 Examples of "info" URIs 
           
      Some examples of syntactically valid "info" URIs are given below: 
         
        a) info:ddc/22/eng//004.678 
         
      where "ddc" is the "namespace" component for a Dewey Decimal 
      Classification [DEWEY] namespace and "22/eng//004.678" is the 
      "identifier" component for an identifier of an information asset 
      within that namespace. 
       
      The information asset identified by the identifier "22/eng//004.678" 
      in the namespace for (22nd Ed.) English-language Dewey Decimal 
      Classifications is the classification  
       
          "Internet" 
    
        b) info:lccn/2002022641 
         
      where "lccn" is the "namespace" component for a Library of Congress 
      Control Number [LCCN] namespace and "2002022641" is the "identifier" 
      component for an identifier of an information asset within that 
      namespace.  
       
      The information asset identified by the identifier "2002022641" in

        d) <rdf:Description about="info:bibcode/2003Icar..163..263Z"/> 
         
      where "bibcode" is the "namespace" component for a NASA ADS Bibcode 
      [BIBCODE] namespace and "2003Icar..163..263Z " is the "identifier" 
      component for an identifier of an information asset within that

      as the subject of an RDF statement. 
       
      The information asset identified by the identifier 
      "2003Icar..163..263Z" in the namespace for NASA ADS Bibcodes is the

   6  Normalization and Comparison of "info" URIs 
       
      In order to facilitate comparison of "info" URIs, a sequence of 
      normalization steps SHOULD be applied. 
       
      Since the "info" URI is case-sensitive, a canonical form MAY only be 
      arrived at by consulting the "info" Registry for possible information 
      on the case-sensitivity for identifiers from a registered public 
      namespace, and any case normalization step to apply. The "info" 
      Registry MAY also disclose additional normalization rules regarding 
      the treatment of punctuation characters and the like. 
       
      The following generic normalization steps SHOULD be applied:

                           The "info" URI Scheme           December 2003 
    
    
          a) Normalize the case of the "scheme" component to be      
             lowercase 
          b) Normalize the case of the "namespace" component to be      
             lowercase 
          c) Unescape all unreserved %-escaped characters in the 
             "namespace" and "identifier" components 
          d) Normalize the case of any %-escaped characters in the 
             "namespace" and "identifier" components to be 
             uppercase 
       
      The subsequent namespace-specific normalization steps MAY be applied: 
       
          e) Normalize the case of the "identifier" component as 
             per any rules that may be recorded in the Registry  
          f) Normalize any punctuation characters in the "identifier" 
             component as per any rules that may be recorded in the 
             Registry 
       
      Note that the "info" URI scheme provides a relative path only for its 
      hierarchical part, and as such any path normalization of dot segments 
      ("/./" and "/../") MUST NOT be applied. 
       
      The following unnormalized forms of an "info" URI 
       
          U1. INFO:PII/S0888-7543(02)96852-7 
          U2. info:PII/S0888754302968527 
          U3. info:pii/S0888%2D7543%2802%2996852%2D7 
          U4. info:pii/s0888-7543(02)96852-7 
    
      are normalized to the following respective forms  
       
          N1. info:pii/S0888-7543(02)96852-7 
          N2. info:pii/S0888754302968527 
          N3. info:pii/S0888-7543(02)96852-7 
          N4. info:pii/s0888-7543(02)96852-7 
    
      If the "info" Registry records the case-sensitivity for identifiers 
      from the "pii" registered public namespace as being case-insensitive 
      and normalized to an uppercase form, then the above URI forms can be 
      reduced to the following forms 
    
       N1,N3. info:pii/S0888-7543(02)96852-7 
          N2. info:pii/S0888754302968527 
       
      If the "info" Registry further records the treatment of punctuation 
      characters for identifiers from the "pii" registered public namespace 
      as being optional and normalized to a punctuation free form, then the 
      above URI forms can be reduced to the following unique canonical form

      If the "info" URI includes a "fragment" component, namespace-specific 
      normalization steps MUST NOT be applied to the "fragment". This would 
      result in being unable to reconcile the following two URI forms

   7  Rationale 
       
   7.1 Why Create a New URI Scheme for Identifiers from Public 
       Namespaces? 
       
      Under RFC 2718, "Guidelines for new URL Schemes" [RFC2718], it is 
      stated that a URI scheme SHOULD have a "demonstrated utility", and in 
      particular SHOULD be applied to "things that cannot be referred to in 
      any other way". The "info" URI scheme allows identifiers within 
      public namespaces, used for the identification of information assets, 
      to be referred to within the URI allocation. Once a namespace is 
      registered in the "info" Registry, the "info" URI scheme enables an 
      information asset with an identifier in that namespace to be 
      referenced by means of a URI.  As a result, the information asset 
      SHALL be considered a resource as defined in RFC 2396 [RFC2396] and 
      SHALL enjoy the same common syntactic, semantic and shared language 
      benefits that the URI presentation confers.  
    
   7.2 Why Not Use an existing URI Scheme for Identifiers from Public 
       Namespaces? 
       
      Existing URI schemes are not suitable for employment as the "info" 
      URI scheme expressly disallows dereference. While examples of 
      resource identifiers minted under other URI schemes may not always be 
      dereferenceable, nevertheless there is a common expectation that such 
      URIs can be dereferenced by various resolution mechanisms, whether 
      they be location-dependent or location-independent resource 
      identifiers. The "info" URI scheme applies to a class of resource 
      identifiers which share a set of common properties including the 
      property of non-dereference. 
       
   7.3 Why Not Create a New URN Namespace ID for Identifiers from Public  
       Namespaces? 
       
      RFC 2141 [RFC2141] states that "Uniform Resource Names (URNs) are 
      intended to serve as persistent, location-independent, resource 
      identifiers." The "info" URI scheme, on the other hand, asserts 
      neither the persistence of the identifiers created under this scheme 
      nor of the public namespaces grandfathered under this scheme. Rather 
    
    
   Van de Sompel            Expires - June 2004                [Page 11] 
                           The "info" URI Scheme           December 2003 
    
    
      it exists purely to disclose the identity of information assets and 
      to facilitate a lightweight registration mechanism for public 
      namespaces of identifiers managed according to the policies and 
      business models of the Namespace Authorities. The "info" URI scheme 
      is neutral with respect to identifier persistence. Moreover, for 
      "info" to operate as a URN NID would require that "info" be 
      constituted as a delegated naming authority. It is not clear that a 
      URN NID would be an appropriate choice for naming authority 
      delegation. 
       
      Further, the "info" URI scheme is not dereferenceable in contrast to 
      the specific recommendation given in RFC 1737, "Functional 
      Requirements for Uniform Resource Names" [RFC1737] that "It is 
      strongly recommended that there be a mapping between the names 
      generated by each naming authority and URLs.". It would therefore be 
      inappropriate to create a URN Namespace ID for the "info" namespaces. 
       
      An extra consideration is that the "urn" URI syntax excludes 
      hierarchy by reserving the slash "/" character. An "info" URI, on the 
      other hand, admits of general hierarchy by allowing the slash "/" 
      character (as well as more liberally allowing the ampersand "&" and 
      tilde "~" characters) and therefore represents a lower barrier to 
      entry in keeping with its intention of acting as a bridging mechanism 
      to allow public namespaces to become part of the URI allocation. That 
      is, an "info" URI is more widely supportive of "human 
      transcribability" as discussed in RFC 2396 [RFC2396] than is a "urn" 
      URI. 
       
      Additionally the "urn" URI syntax does not support "fragment" 
      components as does the "info" URI syntax for indirect identification 
      of secondary resources. 
    
   8  Security Considerations 
           
      The "info" URI scheme syntax is subject to the same security 
      considerations as the generic URI syntax described in RFC 2396 
      [RFC2396]. 
       
      An "info" URI is not dereferenceable and hence no resolution 
      mechanisms are available to a URI processor. Therefore security 
      considerations regarding the use of "info" URIs MUST be limited 
      solely to the nature of the identifier string itself.
