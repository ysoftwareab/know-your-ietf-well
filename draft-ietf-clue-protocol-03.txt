                      draft-ietf-clue-protocol-03

Abstract

   The CLUE protocol is an application protocol conceived for the
   description and negotiation of a CLUE telepresence session.  The
   design of the CLUE protocol takes into account the requirements and
   the framework defined, respectively, in [I-D.ietf-clue-framework] and
   [I-D.ietf-clue-telepresence-requirements].  The companion document
   [I-D.ietf-clue-signaling] delves into CLUE signaling details, as well
   as on the SIP/SDP session establishment phase.  CLUE messages flow
   across the CLUE data channel, based on reliable and ordered SCTP over
   DTLS transport, as described in [I-D.ietf-clue-datachannel].  Message
   details, together with the behavior of CLUE Participants acting as
   Media Providers and/or Media Consumers, are herein discussed.

1.  Introduction

   The CLUE protocol is an application protocol used by two CLUE
   Participants to enhance the experience of a multimedia telepresence
   session.  The main goals of the CLUE protocol are:

   1.  enabling a MP to properly announce its current telepresence
       capabilities to a MC in terms of available media captures, groups
       of encodings, simultaneity constraints and other information
       envisioned in [I-D.ietf-clue-framework];

   2.  enabling a MC to request the desired multimedia streams to the
       offering MP.

   CLUE-capable endpoints are connected by means of the CLUE data
   channel, an SCTP over DTLS channel which is opened and established as
   depicted in [I-D.ietf-clue-signaling] and
   [I-D.ietf-clue-datachannel].  CLUE protocol messages flowing across
   such a channel are detailed in this document, both syntactically and
   semantically.

   In Section 3 we provide a general overview of the CLUE protocol.
   CLUE protocol messages are detailed in Section 4.  The CLUE
   Participant state machine is introduced in Section 5.  Versioning and
   extensions are discussed in Section 7 and Section 8, respectively.
   The XML schema defining the CLUE messages is reported in Section 10.

2.  Terminology

   This document refers to the same terminology used in
   [I-D.ietf-clue-framework] and in
   [I-D.ietf-clue-telepresence-requirements].  We briefly recall herein
   some of the main terms used in the document.  The definition of "CLUE
   Participant" herein proposed is not imported from any of the above
   documents.

   CLUE Participant:  An entity able to use the CLUE protocol within a
      telepresence session.  It can be either an endpoint or an MCU able
      to use the CLUE protocol.

   Endpoint:  The logical point of final termination through receiving,
      decoding and rendering, and/or initiation through capturing,
      encoding, and sending of media streams.  An endpoint consists of
      one or more physical devices which source and sink media streams,
      and exactly one [RFC4353] Participant (which, in turn, includes
      exactly one SIP User Agent).  Endpoints can be anything from
      multiscreen/multicamera room controllers to handheld devices.

   MCU:  Multipoint Control Unit (MCU) - a device that connects two or
      more endpoints together into one single multimedia conference
      [RFC5117].  An MCU may include a Mixer [RFC4353].

   Media:  Any data that, after suitable encoding, can be conveyed over
      RTP, including audio, video or timed text.

   Media Capture:  A "Media Capture", or simply "Capture", is a source
      of Media.

   Capture Encoding:  A specific encoding of a Media Capture, to be sent
      via RTP [RFC3550].

   Media Stream:  The term "Media Stream", or simply "Stream", is used
      as a synonymous of Capture Encoding.

   Media Provider:  A CLUE Participant (i.e., an Endpoint or an MCU)
      able to send Media Streams.

   Media Consumer:  A CLUE Participant (i.e., an Endpoint or an MCU)
      able to receive Media Streams.

3.  Overview of the CLUE protocol

   The CLUE protocol is conceived to enable CLUE telepresence sessions.
   It is designed in order to address SDP limitations in terms of the
   description of some information about the multimedia streams that are
   involved in a real-time multimedia conference.  Indeed, by simply
   using SDP we are not able to convey information about the features of
   the flowing multimedia streams that are needed to enable a "being
   there" rendering experience.  Such information is designed in the
   CLUE framework document and formally defined and described in the
   CLUE data model document.  The CLUE protocol represents the mechanism
   for the exchange of CLUE information between CLUE Participants.  It
   mainly provides the messages to enable a Media Provider to advertise
   its telepresence capabilities and to enable a Media Consumer to
   select the desired telepresence options.

   The CLUE protocol, as defined in the following, is a stateful,
   client-server, XML-based application protocol.  CLUE protocol
   messages flow on a realiable and ordered SCTP over DTLS transport
   channel connecting two CLUE Participants.  Messages carry information
   taken from the XML-based CLUE data model
   ([I-D.ietf-clue-data-model-schema]).  Three main communication layers
   can be identified:

   1.  Establishment of the CLUE data channel: in this phase, the CLUE
       data channel setup takes place.  If it completes successfully,



Presta & Romano          Expires August 9, 2015                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft         draft-ietf-clue-protocol-03         February 2015


       the CPs are able to communicate and start the initiation phase.

   2.  Negotiation of the CLUE protocol version and options (initiation
       phase): the CPs connected via the CLUE data channel agree on the
       version and on the options to be used during the telepresence
       session.  Special CLUE messages are used for such a task.  At the
       end of this basic negotiation, each CP starts its activity as a
       CLUE MP and/or CLUE MC.

   3.  CLUE telepresence capabilities description and negotiation: in
       this phase, the MP-MC dialogues take place on the data channel by
       means of the CLUE protocol messages.

   As soon as the channel is ready, the CLUE Participants must agree on
   the protocol version and extensions to be used within the
   telepresence session.  CLUE protocol version numbers are
   characterized by a major version number and a minor version number,
   both unsigned integers, separated by a dot.  While minor version
   numbers denote backward compatible changes in the context of a given
   major version, different major version numbers generally indicate a
   lack of interoperability between the protocol implementations.  In
   order to correctly establish a CLUE dialogue, the involved CPs MUST
   have in common a major version number (see Section 7 for further
   details).  The subset of the protocol options and extensions that are
   allowed within the CLUE session is also determined in the initiation
   phase, such subset being the one including only the options that are
   supported by both parties.  A mechanism for the negotiation of the
   CLUE protocol version and extensions is envisioned in the initiation
   phase.  According to such a solution, the CP which is the CLUE
   Channel initiator (CI) issues a proper CLUE message (OPTIONS) to the
   CP which is the Channel Receiver (CR) specifying the supported
   version and extensions.  The CR then answers by selecting the subset
   of the CI extensions that it is able to support and determines the
   protocol version to be used.

   After that negotiation phase is completed, CLUE Participants describe
   and agree on the media flows to be exchanged.  Indeed, being CPs A
   and B both transmitting and receiving, it is possible to distinguish
   between two dialogues:

   1.  the one needed to describe and set up the media streams sent from
       A to B, i.e., the dialogue between A's Media Provider side and
       B's Media Consumer side

   2.  the one needed to describe and set up the media streams sent from
       B to A, i.e., the dialogue between B's Media Provider side and
       A's Media Consumer side

Internet-Draft         draft-ietf-clue-protocol-03         February 2015


   CLUE messages for the media session description and negotiation are
   designed by considering the MP side as the server side of the
   protocol, since it produces and provides media streams, and the MC
   side as the client side of the protocol, since it requests and
   receives media streams.  The messages that are exchanged to set up
   the telepresence media session are described by focusing on a single
   MP-MC dialogue.

   The MP first advertises its available media captures and encoding
   capabilities to the MC, as well as its simultaneity constraints,
   according to the information model defined in
   [I-D.ietf-clue-framework].  The CLUE message conveying the MP's
   multimedia offer is the ADVERTISEMENT message.  Such message
   leverages the XML data model definitions provided in
   [I-D.ietf-clue-data-model-schema].

   The MC selects the desired MP streams by using the CONFIGURE message,
   which makes reference to the information carried in the previously
   received ADVERTISEMENT.

   Besides ADVERTISEMENT and CONFIGURE, other messages have been
   conceived in order to provide all the needed mechanisms and
   operations.  Such messages will be detailed in the following
   sections.

4.  Protocol messages

   CLUE protocol messages are textual, XML-based messages that enable
   the configuration of the telepresence session.  The formal definition
   of such messages is provided in the XML Schema at the end of this
   document (Section 10).

   The XML definitions of the CLUE information provided in
   [I-D.ietf-clue-data-model-schema] are included within some CLUE
   protocol messages (namely the ADVERTISEMENT and the CONFIGURE
   messages), in order to use the concepts defined in
   [I-D.ietf-clue-framework].

   The CLUE protocol messages are the following:

   o  OPTIONS

   o  OPTIONS RESPONSE

   o  ADVERTISEMENT (ADV)

   o  ADVERTISEMENT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT (ACK)

Internet-Draft         draft-ietf-clue-protocol-03         February 2015


   o  CONFIGURE (CONF)

   o  CONFIGURE RESPONSE (CONF RESPONSE)

   While the OPTIONS and OPTIONS RESPONSE messages are exchanged in the
   initiation phase between the CPs, the other messages are involved in
   MP-MC dialogues.

   Each CLUE message inherits a basic structure depicted in the
   following excerpt:



<!-- CLUE MESSAGE TYPE -->
<xs:complexType name="clueMessageType" abstract="true">
<xs:sequence>
<xs:element name="clueId" type="xs:string"/>
<xs:element name="sequenceNr" type="xs:unsignedInt"/>
</xs:sequence>
<xs:attribute name="protocol" type="xs:string" fixed="CLUE" use="required"/>
<xs:attribute name="v" type="versionType" use="required"/>
</xs:complexType>

<!-- VERSION TYPE -->
<xs:simpleType name="versionType">
<xs:restriction base="xs:string">
<xs:pattern value="([0-9])+\.([0-9]+)"></xs:pattern>
</xs:restriction>
</xs:simpleType>


   The basic structure determines the mandatory information that is
   carried within each CLUE message.  This information is composed of:

   o  clueId: an XML element containing the identifier of the CP within
      the telepresence system;

   o  sequenceNr: an XML element containing the local message sequence
      number;

   o  protocol: a mandatory attribute set to "CLUE", identifying the
      procotol the messages refer to;

   o  v: a mandatory attribute carrying the version of the protocol.
      The content of the "v" attribute is composed of the major version
      number followed by a dot and then by the minor version number of
      the CLUE protocol in use.  Allowed values are of this kind: "1.3",
      "2.45", etc.

Internet-Draft         draft-ietf-clue-protocol-03         February 2015


   Each CP should manage up to three streams of sequence numbers: (i)
   one for the messages exchanged in the initiation phase, (ii) one for
   the messages exchanged as MP, and (iii) one for the messages
   exchanged as MC.

4.1.  OPTIONS

   The OPTIONS message is sent from the CP which is the CI to the CP
   which is the CR as soon as the CLUE data channel is ready.  Besides
   the information envisioned in the basic structure, it specifies:

   o  mediaProvider: a mandatory boolean field set to "true" if the CP
      is able to act as a MP

   o  mediaConsumer: a mandatory boolean field set to "true" if the CP
      is able to act as a MC

   o  supportedVersions: the list of the supported versions

   o  supportedOptions: the list of the supported options

   The XML Schema of such a message is reported below:

   <supportedVersions> contains the list of the versions that are
   supported by the CI, each represented in a child <version> element.
   The content of each <version> element is a string made by the major
   version number followed by a dot and then by the minor version number
   (e.g., 1.3 or 2.43).  Only one <version> element SHOULD be provided
   for each major version supported, containing the maximum minor
   version number of such a version, since all minor versions are
   backward compatible.  If no <supportedVersions> is carried whithin
   the OPTIONS message, the CI supports only the version declared in the
   "v" attribute and all the versions having the same major version
   number and lower minor version number.  For example, if the "v"
   attribute has a value of "3.4" and there is no <supportedVersions>
   tag in the OPTIONS message, it means the CI supports only major
   version 3 with all the minor versions comprised between 3.0 and 3.4,
   with version 3.4 included.  If a <supportedVersion> is provided, at
   least one <version> tag MUST be included.

   The <supportedOptions> element specifies the list of options
   supported by the CI.  If there is no <supportedOptions> in the
   OPTIONS message, the CI does not support anything other than what is
   envisioned in the versions it supports.  For each option, an <option>
   element is provided.  An option is characterized by a name, an XML
   schema of reference where the option is defined, and the version of
   the protocol which the option refers to.

4.2.  OPTIONS RESPONSE

   The OPTIONS RESPONSE is sent by a CR to a CI as a reply to the
   OPTIONS message.  As depicted in the figure below, the OPTIONS
   RESPONSE contains mandatorily a response code and a response string
   indicating the processing result of the OPTIONS message.  Following,
   the CR attaches two boolean tags, <mediaProvider> and
   <mediaConsumer>, expressing the supported roles in terms of
   respectively MP and MC, similarly to what the CI does in the OPTIONS
   message.  These two elements are optional in the OPTIONS RESPONSE
   since, in case of error response code, the CR might not want to add
   further information besides the response code and the reason string.
   In case of no errors, the CR MUST insert within the OPTIONS RESPONSE
   the <mediaProvider> and the <mediaConsumer> elements.  Finally, the
   highest commonly supported version number is expressed in the
   <version> field.  The content of the <version> element MUST be a
   string made of the major version number followed by a dot and then by
   the minor version number (e.g., 1.3 or 2.43).  Matching options
   (i.e., those in common between the CI and the CR) are copied in the
   the <commonOptions> field.

   After the reception of such a message, the version to be used is
   determined by each part of the conversation.  Indeed, it is the one
   provided in the <version> tag of the OPTIONS RESPONSE message.  The
   following CLUE messages MUST use such a version number in the "v"
   attribute.  The allowed options in the CLUE dialogue will be those
   indicated in the <commonOptions> of the OPTIONS RESPONSE message.

4.3.  ADVERTISEMENT

   The ADVERTISEMENT message (ADV) is used by the MP to advertise the
   available media captures and related information to the MC.  The MP
   sends to the MC an ADV as soon as it is ready after the successful
   completion of the initiation phase, i.e., as soon as the version and
   the options of the CLUE protocol are agreed between the CPs.  During
   the telepresence session, the ADV can be sent from the MP both
   periodically and on a per-event basis, i.e., each time there are
   changes in the MP's CLUE telepresence capabilities.

   The ADV structure is defined in the picture below.  The ADV contains
   elements compliant with the CLUE data model that characterize the
   MP's telepresence offer.  Namely, such elements are: the list of the
   media captures (<mediaCaptures>), of the encoding groups
   (<encodingGroups>), of the capture scenes (<captureScenes>) of the
   global views (<globalViews>), and of the represented participants
   (<people>).  Each of them is fully described in the CLUE framework
   document and formally defined in the CLUE data model document.

4.4.  ADVERTISEMENT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

   The ADVERTISEMENT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message (ACK) is sent by a MC to a
   MP to acknowledge an ADV message.  As it can be seen from the message
   schema provided in the following, the ACK contains a response code
   and a reason string describing the processing result of the ADV.  The
   <advSequenceNr> carries the sequence number of the ADV the ACK refers
   to.

4.5.  CONFIGURE

   The CONFIGURE message (CONF) is sent from a MC to a MP to list the
   advertised captures the MC wants to receive.  The MC can send a CONF
   after the reception of an ADV or each time it wants to request other
   captures that have been previously advertised by the MP.  The content
   of the CONF message is shown below.



    <!-- CLUE CONFIGURE MESSAGE TYPE -->
   <xs:complexType name="configureMessageType">

   </xs:sequence>
   <xs:anyAttribute namespace="##other" processContents="lax"/>
   </xs:extension>
   </xs:complexContent>
   </xs:complexType>


   The <advSequenceNr> element contains the sequence number of the ADV
   message the CONF refers to.

   The optional boolean <ack> element, set to "true", if present,
   indicates that the CONF message also acknowledges receipt of the
   referred advertisement, hence providing a piggybacking mechanism for
   the simultaneous acknowledgment and response to the ADV message.  The
   <ack> element SHOULD not be present if an ACK message has been
   already sent back to the MP.

   The most important content of the CONFIGURE message is the list of
   the capture encodings provided in the <captureEncodings> element.
   Such an element contains a sequence of capture encodings,
   representing the streams to be instantiated.

   The CONFIGURE RESPONSE message (CONF RESPONSE) is sent from the MP to
   the MC to communicate the processing result of requests carried in
   the previously received CONF message.  It contains a response code
   with a reason string indicating either the success or the failure
   (along with failure details) of a CONF request processing.
   Following, the <confSequenceNr> field contains the number of the CONF
   message the response refers to.

5.  Protocol state machines

   The CLUE protocol is an application protocol used between two CPs in
   order to properly configure a multimedia telepresence session.  CLUE
   protocol messages flow across the CLUE Data Channel, a DTLS/SCTP
   channel established as depicted in [I-D.ietf-clue-signaling].  Over
   such a channel there are typically two CLUE streams between the
   channel terminations flowing in opposite directions.  In other words,
   typically, both channel terminations act simultaneously as a MP and

   as a MC.  We herein discuss the state machines associated,
   respectively, with the CLUE Participant, with the MC process and with
   the MP process.

6.  CLUE Participant's state machine

   The main state machines focus on the behavior of the CLUE Participant
   (CP) acting as a CLUE channel initiator/receiver (CI/CR).

   The initial state is called IDLE.  When in the IDLE state, the CLUE
   data channel is not established and no CLUE-controlled media are
   exchanged between the two considered telepresence devices (if there
   is an ongoing exchange of media streams, such media streams are not
   currently CLUE-controlled).

   When the CLUE data channel set up starts ("start channel setup"), the
   CP moves from the IDLE state to the CHANNEL SETUP state.

   If the CLUE data channel is successfully set up ("channel
   established"), the CP moves from the CHANNEL SETUP state to the
   OPTIONS state.  Otherwise ("channel error"), it moves back to the
   IDLE state.  The same transition happens if the telepresence session
   ends ("session ends").

   When in the OPTIONS state, the CP addresses the initiation phase
   where both parts agree on the version and on the options to be used
   in the subsequent CLUE messages exchange phase.  If the CP is the
   Channel Initiator (CI), it sends an OPTIONS message and waits for the
   OPTIONS RESPONSE message.  If the CP is the Channel Receiver (CR), it
   waits for the OPTIONS message and, as soon as it arrives, replies
   with the OPTIONS RESPONSE message.  If the negotiation is
   successfully completed ("OPTIONS phase success"), the CP moves from
   the OPTIONS state to the ACTIVE state.  If the initiation phase fails
   ("OPTIONS phase failure"), the CP moves from the OPTIONS state to the
   IDLE state.  The initiation phase might fail because of one of the
   following reasons:

   1.  the CI receives an OPTIONS RESPONSE with an error response code

   2.  the CI does not receive any OPTIONS RESPONSE and a timeout error
       is raised

   3.  the CR does not receive any OPTIONS and a timeout error is raised

   When in the ACTIVE state, the CP starts the envisioned sub-state
   machines (i.e., the MP state machine and the MC state machine)
   according to the roles it plays in the telepresence sessions.  Such
   roles have been previously declared in the OPTIONS and OPTIONS

Internet-Draft         draft-ietf-clue-protocol-03         February 2015


   RESPONSE messages involved in the initiation phase (see OPTIONS
   sections Section 4.1 and Section 4.2 for the details).  When in the
   ACTIVE state, the CP delegates the sending and the processing of the
   CLUE messages to the appropriate MP/MC sub-state machines.  If the CP
   receives a further OPTIONS/OPTIONS RESPONSE message, it MUST ignore
   the message and stay in the ACTIVE state.

   The CP moves from the ACTIVE state to the IDLE one when the sub-state
   machines that have been activated are (both) in the relative
   TERMINATED state (see sections Section 6.1 and Section 6.2).

6.1.  Media Provider's state machine

   As soon as the sub-state machine of the MP is activated, it is in the
   ADV state.  In the ADV state, the MP is preparing the ADV message
   reflecting its actual telepresence capabilities.

   After the ADV has been sent, the MP moves from the ADV state to the
   WAIT FOR ACK state.  If an ACK message with a successful response
   code arrives ("ACK received"), the MP moves to the WAIT FOR CONF
   state.  If an ACK with an error response code arrives ("NACK
   received") and the number of NACKs for the issued ADV is under the
   retry threshold, the MP moves back to the ADV state for preparing a
   new ADV.  The same happens if the waiting time for the ACK is fired a
   number of times under the retry threshold ("timeout && retry not
   expired"): also in this case, the MP goes back to the ADV state to
   send a new copy of the ADV.  If the number of retries overcomes the
   threshold, the MP moves from the WAIT FOR ACK state to the MP-
   TERMINATED state.  When in the WAIT FOR ACK state, if a CONF+ACK
   message arrives ("CONF+ACK received"), the MP goes directly to the
   CONF RESPONSE state.  CONF+ACK messages referring to out-of-date ADVs
   MUST be ignored, i.e., they do not trigger any state transition.  If
   the telepresence settings of the MP change while in the WAIT FOR ACK
   state ("changed telepresence settings"), the MP MUST create a new
   advertisement, so it switches from the WAIT FOR ACK state to the ADV
   state.

   When in the WAIT FOR CONF state, the MP is listening to the channel
   for a CONF request coming from the MC.  If a CONF arrives ("CONF
   received"), the MP switches to the CONF RESPONSE state.  In case of a
   timeout, if the retry threshold has not been overcome ("timeout &&
   retry not expired"), the MP moves back to the ADV state.  When the
   retry expires ("retry expired") the MP moves to the MP TERMINATED
   state.  If the telepresence settings change in the meanwhile
   ("changed telepresence settings"), the MP moves from the WAIT FOR
   CONF back to the ADV state to create the new ADV to be sent to the
   MC.

   The MP in the CONF RESPONSE state is processing the received CONF in
   order to produce a CONF RESPONSE message.  If the MP is fine with the
   MC's configuration, then it sends a 200 OK CONF RESPONSE ("success
   CONF RESPONSE sent") and moves to the ESTABLISHED state.  If there
   are errors in the CONF processing, then the MP issues a CONF RESPONSE
   carrying an error response code ("error CONF RESPONSE sent") and, if
   under the retry threshold ("retry not expired"), it goes back to the
   WAIT FOR CONF state to wait for a new configuration request.  If the
   number of trials exceeds the retry threshold ("retry expired"), the
   state MP TERMINATED is reached.  Finally, if there are changes in the
   MP's telepresence settings, the MP switches to the ADV state.

   The MP in the ESTABLISHED state has successfully negotiated the media
   streams with the MC by means of the CLUE messages.  If there are
   changes in the MP's telepresence settings, the MP moves back to the
   ADV state.  In the ESTABLISHED state, the CLUE-controlled media
   streams of the session are those described in the last successfully
   processed CONF message.

6.2.  Media Consumer's state machine

   As soon as the sub-state machine of the MC is activated, it is in the
   WAIT FOR ADV state.  An MC in the WAIT FOR ADV state is waiting for
   an ADV coming from the MP.  If the ADV arrives ("ADV received"), the
   MC reaches the ADV PROCESSING state.  Otherwise, the MC is stuck in
   the WAIT FOR ADV state.

   In the ADV PROCESSING state, the ADV is parsed by the MC.  If the ADV
   is successfully processed, there are two possibilities.  According to
   the former option, the MC issues a successful ACK message to the MP
   ("ACK sent") and moves to the CONF state.  In the latter case, the MC
   sends a CONF message with the <ack> field set to "true" ("CONF+ACK
   sent") and goes directly to the WAIT FOR CONF RESPONSE state.

   If something goes wrong with the ADV parsing (bad syntax, missing XML
   elements, etc.), and the number of times this has happened is under
   the retry treshold, the MC sends a NACK message (an ACK with an error
   response code) to the MP describing the problem via a proper reason
   phrase.  In this way ("NACK sent && retry not expired"), the MC
   switches back to the WAIT FOR ADV state, waiting for a new ADV.  If
   the NACK retry expires ("retry expired"), the MC moves to the MC
   TERMINATED state.

   When in the CONF state, the MC is preparing the CONF request to be
   issued to the MP on the basis of the previously ACK-ed ADV.  When the
   CONF has been sent ("CONF sent"), the MC moves to the WAIT FOR CONF
   RESPONSE state.  If a new ADV arrives in the meanwhile, the MC goes
   back to the PROCESSING ADV state.

   In the WAIT FOR CONF RESPONSE state, the MC is waiting for the MP's
   response to the issued CONF or CONF+ACK.  If a 200 OK CONF RESPONSE
   message is received ("successful CONF RESPONSE received"), it means
   that the MP and the MC have successfully agreed on the media streams
   to be shared.  Then, the MC can move to the ESTABLISHED state.  On
   the other hand, if an error response is received and the associated
   retry counter does not overcome the threshold ("error CONF RESPONSE
   received && retry not expired"), the MC moves back to the CONF state
   to prepare a new CONF request.  In case of "retry expired", the MC
   moves to the MC TERMINATED state.  If no CONF RESPONSE arrives at
   all, and the number of timeouts is under the threshold, the MC moves
   to the WAIT FOR ADV state, waiting for a new ADV.  If a new ADV is
   received in the WAIT FOR CONF RESPONSE state, the MC switches to the
   ADV PROCESSING state.

   When the MC is in the ESTABLISHED state, the telepresence session
   configuration has been set up at the CLUE application level according
   to the MC's preferences.  Both the MP and the MC have agreed on (and

   are aware of) the CLUE-controlled media streams to be exchanged
   within the call.  While in the ESTABLISHED state, it might happen
   that the MC decides to change something in the call settings.  The MC
   then issues a new CONF ("CONF sent") and goes to wait for the new
   CONF RESPONSE in the WAIT FOR CONF RESPONSE state.  If a new ADV
   arrives from the MP ("ADV received"), it means that something has
   changed on the MP's side.  The MC then moves to the ADV PROCESSING
   state.

7.  Versioning

   CLUE protocol messages are XML messages compliant to the CLUE
   protocol XML schema.  The version of the protocol corresponds to the
   version of the schema.  Both client and server have to test the
   compliance of the received messages with the XML schema of the CLUE
   protocol.  If the compliance is not verified, the message cannot be
   processed further.

   Obviously, client and server cannot communicate if they do not share
   exactly the same XML schema.  Such a schema is the one included in
   this document, and associated with the CLUE URN
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:clue-message".  If all CLUE-enabled devices
   use that schema there will be no interoperability problems due to
   schema issues.

   The version of the XML schema contained in the standard document
   deriving from this draft will be 1.0.  The version usage is similar
   in philosophy to XMPP ([RFC6120]).  A version number has major and
   minor components, each a non-negative integer.  Major version changes
   denote non-interoperable changes.  Minor version changes denote
   schema changes that are backward compatible by ignoring unknown XML
   elements, or other backward compatible changes.

   The minor versions of the XML schema MUST be backward compatible, not
   only in terms of schema but also semantically and procedurally.  This
   means that they should define further features and functionality
   besides those defined in the previous versions, in an incremental
   way, without impacting the basic rules defined in the previous
   version of the schema.  In this way, if a MP is able to speak, e.g.,
   version 1.5 of the protocol while the MC only understands version
   1.4, the MP should have no problem in reverting the dialogue back to
   version 1.4 without exploiting 1.5 features and functionality.

   It is expected that, before the CLUE protocol XML schema reaches a
   steady state, prototypes developed by different organizations will
   conduct interoperability testing.  In that case, in order to
   interoperate, they have to be compliant to the current version of the
   XML schema, i.e., the one copied in the most up-to-date version of
   the draft defining the CLUE protocol.  The versions of the non-
   standard XML schema will be numbered as 0.01, 0.02, and so on.
   During the standard development phase, the versions of the XML schema
   will probably not be backward compatible so it is left to prototype
   implementers the responsibility of keeping their products up to date.

8.  Extensions and options

   Although the standard version of the CLUE protocol XML schema will be
   designed to thoroughly cope with the requirements emerging from the
   application domain, new needs might arise and extensions can be
   designed.  Extensions specify information and behaviors that are not
   described in a certain version of the protocol.  They can relate to:

   1.  new information, to be carried in the existing messages.  For
       example, we may want to add more fields within an existing
       message;

   2.  new messages.  This is the case if there is no proper message for
       a certain task, so a brand new CLUE message needs to be defined.

   As to the first type of extensions, it is possible to distinguish
   between protocol-specific and data model information.  Indeed, CLUE
   messages are envelopes carrying both:

   o  (i) XML elements defined within the CLUE protocol XML schema
      itself (protocol-specific information)

   o  (ii) other XML elements compliant to the CLUE data model schema
      (data model information)

   When new protocol-specific information is needed somewhere in the
   protocol messages, it can be added in place of the <any> elements and
   <anyAttribute> elements envisioned by the protocol schema.  The
   policy currently defined in the protocol schema for handling <any>
   and <anyAttribute> elements is:

   o  elementFormDefault="qualified"

   o  attributeFormDefault="unqualified"

   In that case, the new information must be qualified by namespaces
   other than "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:clue-message" (the protocol URN)
   and "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:clue-info" (the data model URN).
   Elements or attributes from unknown namespaces MUST be ignored.

   The other matter concerns data model information.  Data model
   information is defined by the XML schema associated with the URN
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:clue-info".  Also for the XML elements
   defined in such a schema there are extensibility issues.  Those
   issues are overcome by using <any> and <anyAttribute> placeholders.
   Similarly to what said before, new information within data model
   elements can be added in place of <any> and <anyAttribute> schema
   elements, as long as they are properly namespace qualified.

   On the other hand (second type of extensions), "extra" CLUE protocol
   messages, i.e., messages not envisioned in the latest standard
   version of the schema, can be needed.  In that case, the messages and
   the associated behavior should be defined in external documents that
   both communication parties must be aware of.

   Both types of extensions, i.e., new information and new messages, can
   be characterized by:

   o  a name;

   o  an external XML Schema defining the XML information and/or the XML
      messages representing the extension;

   o  the standard version of the protocol the extension refers to.

   For that reason, the extensions can be represented by means of the
   <option> element as defined below, which is carried within the
   OPTIONS and OPTIONS RESPONSE messages to represent the extensions
   supported by the CI and by the CR, respectively.



   <!-- OPTION TYPE -->

9.  Details on CLUE Protocol Enhancement

   The CLUE protocol may be extended in a number of ways:

   1.  New values for existing:

       *  Media Capture Attributes as defined in section 7.1.1/
          [I-D.ietf-clue-framework];

       *  MCC Attributes as defined in section 7.2.1/
          [I-D.ietf-clue-framework];

Internet-Draft         draft-ietf-clue-protocol-03         February 2015


       *  Capture Scene Attributes as in section 7.3.1/
          [I-D.ietf-clue-framework];

       *  Capture Scene View attributes as in section 7.3.2/
          [I-D.ietf-clue-framework].

   2.  New Media Capture, MCC, Capture Scene or Capture Scene View
       attributes

   3.  New Error Response Codes

   4.  New or modified elements related to the syntax of the CLUE
       protocol (enhancements not related to CLUE attributes or
       attribute values).

   The CLUE OPTION mechanism is used to indicate support for
   enhancements related to attributes (i.e., 1 and 2 above).
   Enhancements to CLUE protocol syntax as a result of 3 and 4 may
   require a new protocol version or may use the OPTION mechanism.
   However the procedure for specifying and registering a syntax related
   OPTION is different to an OPTION affecting attributes/attribute
   values.  An OPTIONs mechanism is used for syntax that is optional for
   an endpoint to receive.  A new CLUE protocol version is used where
   updated syntax MUST be supported by an endpoint.

9.1.  CLUE OPTION registration

   Registrations for CLUE OPTIONS are requested from the IANA.  This
   section outlines the procedures for documenting and registering a new
   CLUE OPTION.

9.1.1.  Attribute / Attribute Value related OPTIONs

   The process for registering an attribute/attribute value related CLUE
   OPTION is deemed to be "specification required" as per [RFC5226].
   Each OPTION may only contain a single new attribute or one or more
   value additions to an existing attribute.

   The specification MUST include the following information:

   o  Option Name: String [1-64 Characters].

   o  Option Description: A high level text indicating what the CLUE
      OPTION is for.

   o  Specification Reference: A URL to the publicly available document
      containing the OPTION.

Internet-Draft         draft-ietf-clue-protocol-03         February 2015


   o  XML Schema Reference: The XML schema reference

   o  Minimum CLUE Version: The minimum version of the CLUE protocol
      that the OPTION pertains to.

   o  Attribute Name: An existing attribute name is used when the OPTION
      introduces new value/s.  A new unique attribute name is used when
      introducing a new attribute.  OPTION requesters SHOULD check the
      IANA CLUE OPTION registry to ensure that new attributes have a
      unique name within the attribute type.

   o  Attribute Type (optional): When introducing a new attribute the
      type of attribute, "Media Capture", "MCC", "Capture Scene" or
      "Capture Scene View" MUST be indicated.  It is not possible to
      change the attribute type of an existing attribute.

   o  Attribute Description (optional): This description MUST be
      included for a new attribute.  It describes the functionality
      associated with the attribute.

   o  Value Description: The specification MUST include a description of
      the new values, including allowed values, values ranges, value
      type and a description of the values.  The introduction of new
      value/s MUST NOT change the value type (e.g. from string to
      integer) nor SHOULD it change the meaning of existing values.

   o  XML Schema (optional): The specification MUST contain an XML
      schema detailing the new attribute and its values.  If an OPTION
      describes a new value in an existing value range updates to the
      XML schema is not required.

   Developers of specifications of new CLUE OPTIONS are encouraged to
   send their specifications to the IETF CLUE working group for comment
   before requesting registration of a new CLUE OPTION with the IANA.

   Once the request for CLUE OPTION registration is received by IANA, it
   will be forwarded to the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG)
   appointed Expert for review.  During the review, the specification
   with the requested CLUE OPTION will be compared to the above criteria
   for completeness, as well as being compared against protocol syntax
   and procedures.  It will be compared against existing OPTIONS to see
   that it does not duplicate existing functionalities.  It will be
   reviewed to see that any potential security issues are addressed.
   The Expert reviewer will then work towards a resolution of any issues
   with the OPTIONS requester.  The IESG appointed Expert may complete
   the review in consultation with other CLUE experts (i.e., via email
   to IETF CLUE email list).  If the CLUE OPTION is deemed suitable, the
   IESG appointed Expert shall issue a statement indicating approval,

   copied to IANA.

   The IESG Expert reviewer will ensure the following is recorded with
   the IANA for each OPTION:

   1.  A unique string name is registered for each CLUE OPTION.  CLUE
       OPTION names are allocated on a first come-first served basis if
       all other conditions are met;

   2.  The attribute type and name of the affected attribute.  This is
       to facilitate cross checking of OPTIONs to ensure that namespaces
       and values within a namespace do not overlap;

   3.  A reference to a specification that describes the OPTION;

   4.  A contact name, an email and postal addresses for the CLUE
       OPTIONS requester shall be provided.  The contact information
       shall be updated by the defining organization, as necessary.

9.1.2.  Syntax / Response code related OPTIONs

   The process for registering a syntax or response code related CLUE
   OPTION is deemed to be "Standards Action" as per [RFC5226].

   The RFC MUST include the following information:

   o  Option Name: String [1-64 Characters].

   o  Option Description: A high level text indicating what the CLUE
      OPTION is for.

   o  XML Schema Reference: The XML schema reference.

   o  Minimum CLUE Version: The minimum version of the CLUE protocol
      that the OPTION pertains to.

   o  XML Schema Description: A description of the new XML elements and
      any possible relationship to the existing CLUE protocol elements.

   o  XML Schema: The specification MUST contain an XML schema detailing
      the new syntax.  It is not possible to modify or remove existing
      XML syntax via an OPTIONs specification.

   o  The responsible IETF WG SHALL ensure the following is recorded
      with the IANA for each syntax OPTION:

      1.  A unique string name is registered for each CLUE OPTION.  CLUE
          OPTION names are allocated on a first come-first served basis

          if all other conditions are met.

      2.  An indication that the OPTION is related to syntax.

      3.  A reference to the RFC that describes the OPTION.

10.  XML Schema

   In this section, the XML schema defining the CLUE messages is
   provided.

12.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a new XML namespace, a new XML schema and the
   MIME type for the schema.  This document also registers the "CLUE"
   Application Service tag and the "CLUE" Application Protocol tag and
   defines registries for the CLUE messages and response codes.

12.1.  URN Sub-Namespace Registration

   This section registers a new XML namespace,
   ""urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:clue-protocol"".

        <p>See <a href="[[RFC URL]]">
           RFCXXXX</a>.</p>
      </body>
    </html>
   END


12.2.  XML Schema registration

   This section registers an XML schema per the guidelines in [RFC3688].

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:clue-protocol

   Registrant Contact: CLUE working group (clue@ietf.org), Simon Pietro
   Romano (spromano@unina.it).

   Schema: The XML for this schema can be found as the entirety of
   Section 10 of this document.

12.3.  MIME Media Type Registration for 'application/clue+xml'

   This section registers the " "application/clue+xml"" MIME type.

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type application/clue+xml

Internet-Draft         draft-ietf-clue-protocol-03         February 2015


   MIME media type name: application

   MIME subtype name: clue+xml

   Required parameters: (none)

   Optional parameters: charset
   Same as the charset parameter of "application/xml" as specified in
   [RFC3023], Section 3.2.

   Encoding considerations: Same as the encoding considerations of
   "application/xml" as specified in [RFC3023], Section 3.2.

   Security considerations: This content type is designed to carry
   protocol data related to telepresence session control.  Some of the
   data could be considered private.  This media type does not provide
   any protection and thus other mechanisms such as those described in
   Section Security are required to protect the data.  This media type
   does not contain executable content.

   Interoperability considerations: None.

   Published specification: RFC XXXX [[NOTE TO IANA/RFC-EDITOR: Please
   replace XXXX with the RFC number for this specification.]]

   Applications that use this media type: CLUE participants.

   Additional Information: Magic Number(s): (none),
   File extension(s): .clue,
   Macintosh File Type Code(s): TEXT.

   Person & email address to contact for further information: Simon
   Pietro Romano (spromano@unina.it).

   Intended usage: LIMITED USE

   Author/Change controller: The IETF

   Other information: This media type is a specialization of
   application/xml [RFC3023], and many of the considerations described
   there also apply to application/clue+xml.

12.4.  DNS Registrations

   Section 12.4.1 defines an Application Service tag of "CLUE", which is
   used to identify the CLUE service.  The Application Protocol tag
   "CLUE", defined in Section 12.4.2, is used to identify a CLUE
   Participant that understands CLUE.

   Defining RFC: RFC XXXX [[NOTE TO IANA/RFC-EDITOR: Please replace XXXX
   with the RFC number for this specification.]]

   Registration/Assignment Procedures: Following the policies outlined
   in [RFC5226], the IANA policy for assigning new values for the CLUE
   message types for the CLUE protocol is Specification Required.

   Registrant Contact: IETF CLUE working group (clue@ietf.org), Simon
   Pietro Romano (spromano@unina.it).

   The initial Message table is populated using the CLUE messages
   described in Section 4 and defined in the XML schema in Section 10.

   Defining RFC: RFC XXXX [[NOTE TO IANA/RFC-EDITOR: Please replace XXXX
   with the RFC number for this specification.]]

   Registration/Assignment Procedures: Following the policies outlined
   in [RFC5226], the IANA policy for assigning new values for the
   Response codes for CLUE shall be Specification Required.

   Registrant Contact: IETF CLUE working group (clue@ietf.org), Simon
   Pietro Romano (spromano@unina.it).

   The initial Response-code table is populated using the Response codes
   defined in Section 4.7 as follows:

   ToDo: table: number, default response string, description, reference

13.  Diff with draft-ietf-clue-protocol-02

   o  CLUE Participant state machine: TERMINATED state replaced with
      IDLE.

   o  MP and MC state machines: SDP O/A state removed.

   o  Diff mechanism (and related example) removed.

   o  Schema updates: versionType used as the data type for all versions
      fields, xs:unsignedInt used as the data type for all sequence

      number fields, diff support removed from the ADV definition.

   o  Section "Details on CLUE protocol Enhancement" added.

14.  Diff with draft-ietf-clue-protocol-01

   o  The diff mechanism for the ADV message has been introduced.

   o  READV and READV RESPONSE message have been both removed.

   o  The state machines have been deeply reviewed and changed.

   o  References: references have been updated and splitted into
      Informative references and Normative references as in framework
      v17.

   o  Schema: <globalSceneEntries> changed in <globalViews>,
      <participants> in <people>

   o  Terminology: many definitions added.

   o  Response codes updated.

15.  Diff with draft-ietf-clue-protocol-00

   1.  The XML schema of the ADVERTISEMENT and of the READV have been
       aligned with the current definitions in
       [I-D.ietf-clue-data-model-schema] (example of updates:
       <participants> --> <people>, <globalCaptureEntries> -->
       <globalSceneEntries>)

   2.  Text has been added to clarify that, in the OPTIONS RESPONSE,
       when the response code is not an error response code, both
       <mediaProvider> and <mediaConsumer> are mandatory.

   3.  The content of the "v" attribute and of the <version> elements
       carried in the OPTIONS and OPTIONS RESPONSE messages has been
       described more precisely.

   4.  Advertisement examples have been added.

16.  Diff with draft-presta-clue-protocol-04

   1.  The response code type error in the OPTIONS response (and in
       other parts) has been corrected.

17.  Diff with draft-presta-clue-protocol-03

   1.  The XML Schema has been deeply revised and completed.

   2.  The descriptions of the CLUE messages have been added.

   3.  The distinction between major version numbers and minor version
       numbers has been cut and pasted from [I-D.ietf-clue-signaling].

   4.  Besides the two way one, a three way mechanism for the options
       negotiation has been proposed and provided to foster discussion.

18.  Diff with draft-presta-clue-protocol-02

   1.  "Terminology" section added.

   2.  Introduced the concept of "CLUE Participant" - an Endpoint or a
       MCU able to use the CLUE protocol within a telepresence session.
       A CLUE Participant can act as a Media Provider and/or as a Media
       Consumer.

   3.  Introduced the ACK/NACK mechanism for the ADVERTISEMENT.

   4.  MP and MC state machines have been updated.  The CP state machine
       has been added.
