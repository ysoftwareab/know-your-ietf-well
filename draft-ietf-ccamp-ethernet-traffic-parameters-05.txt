Conventions Used In This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

   Moreover, the reader is assumed to be familiar with the terminology
   [MEF10.1] as well as [RFC3471] and [RFC3473].

1. Introduction

   Per [RFC3471], GMPLS allows the inclusion of technology specific
   parameters in signaling. Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC and FLOWSPEC specific
   objects are introduced in this document that describe Metro Ethernet
   Forum (MEF) Ethernet traffic parameters as specified in [MEF10.1].

   These traffic parameters MUST be used when L2SC is specified in the
   LSP Switching Type field of a Generalized Label Request (see
   [RFC3471]) and the LSP encoding type is Ethernet.

   For Ethernet Private Line (EPL) services [MEF6], these traffic
   parameters are applicable non-discriminately to all EVCs crossing a
   given port.

   For Ethernet Virtual Private Line (EVPL) services [MEF6], these
   traffic parameters are applicable per Ethernet Virtual Connection
   (EVC) with single or multiple Class of Service (CoS), independent
   of its associated (set of) VLAN ID (VID).

   Association between EVC and VIDs is detailed in [MEF10.1]. The format
   and encoding of the (set of) VIDs is documented in a companion
   document [GMPLS-ESVCS].

2. Overview

   The Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC/FLOWSPEC object includes the Ethernet link
   type (switching granularity) of the requested LSP, and the MTU value
   for the LSP.

   The Bandwidth Profile defines the set of traffic parameters
   applicable to a sequence of Service Frames, referred to as bandwidth
   profile parameters:

   - Committed Rate: Indicates the rate at which traffic commits to
     be sent to the Ethernet LSP. The Committed Rate is described in
     terms of the CIR (Committed Information Rate) and CBS (Committed
     Burst Size) traffic parameters.

Ethernet Traffic Parameters                                    July 2008


     CIR is defined as the average rate (in bytes per unit of time)
     up to which the network is committed to transfer frames and
     meets its performance objectives.

     CBS defines a limit on the maximum number of information units
     (e.g., bytes) available for a burst of frames sent at the
     interface speed to remain CIR-conformant.

   - Excess Rate: Indicates the extent by which the traffic sent on an
     Ethernet LSP exceeds the committed rate. The Excess Rate is
     described in terms of the EIR (Excess Information Rate) and EBS
     (Excess Burst Size) traffic parameters.

     EIR is defined as the average rate (in bytes per unit of time),
     in excess of the CIR, up to which the network may transfer
     frames without any performance objectives.

     EBS defines a limit on the maximum number of information units
     (e.g., bytes) available for a burst of frames sent at the
     interface speed to remain EIR-conformant.

   - The color mode (CM) parameter indicates whether the "color-
     aware" or "color-blind" property is employed by the bandwidth
     profile.

   - The coupling flag (CF) parameter allows the choice between two
     modes of operations of the rate enforcement algorithm.

3. Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC Object

   The Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object (Class-Num = 12, Class-Type = TBA by
   IANA recommended value 6) has the following format:

    0                   1                   2                   3

            Values 1 through 239 are assigned by IANA via IETF Standards
            Track RFC Action.

            Values 240 through 254 are reserved for vendor specific
            usage.

         Length: 16 bits

            Indicates the length in bytes of the whole TLV including the 
            Type and Length fields. A value field whose length is not a 
            multiple of four MUST be zero-padded (with trailing zeros) 
            so that the TLV is four-octet aligned.

3.1 Ethernet Bandwidth Profile TLV

   The Type 2 TLV indicates the Ethernet Bandwidth Profile. It defines
   an upper bound on the volume of the expected service frames belonging
   to a particular Ethernet service instance. The Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC
   object MAY include more than one Ethernet Bandwidth Profile TLV.

   The Type 2 TLV has the following format:

Ethernet Traffic Parameters                                    July 2008


   Profile: 8 bits (this field is to be registered by IANA)

      This field is defined as a vector of binary flags. The following
      flags are defined:

         Flag 1 (bit 0): coupling flag (CF)
         Flag 2 (bit 1): color mode (CM)

      Where bit 0 is the low order bit. Other flags are reserved,
      they SHOULD be set to zero when sent, and SHOULD be ignored when
      received.

      A flag is set to one to indicate that the corresponding metering
      is requested.

      The Flag 1 allows the choice between two modes of operations of
      the rate enforcement algorithm.

      The Flag 2 indicates whether the color-aware or color-blind
      property is employed by the bandwidth profile. When Flag 2 is set
      to 0 (1), the bandwidth profile algorithm is said to be in
      color blind (color aware) mode.

   Index: 8 bits

      The index field is used to reference bandwidth allocated for a
      given traffic class in case a multiple-class LSP is being
      requested. The index field value MUST correspond to at least one
      of the index value included in the extended ClassType object ([DS-
      TE], [MCOS]).

      A given index value j can be associated to at most N Class-Type
      values CTi (i =< N) of the extended Class-Type object. This
      applies in case a set of one or more CTi maps a single BW profile
      (shared). An example of value setting consists then in assigning
      an arbitrary value (between 0x10 and 0x77) associated to set of
      CTi.

      As a particular case, a given index value j can be associated to a
      single CTi (1:1 correspondence). An example of index value setting
      consists then in allocating the CTi value to the index field
      itself (i.e. 0x00,...,0x07). This applies in case a single CTi
      maps a single BW profile or multiple BW profiles (dedicated). In
      the former case (single BW profile), the Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC
      object includes a single Ethernet Bandwidth Profile TLV. In the
      second case, the Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC includes a set of more than
      one Ethernet Bandwidth Profile TLVs (whose respective index value
      is associated to a single CTi value).

Ethernet Traffic Parameters                                    July 2008


      Note that the current specification allow for combining shared and
      dedicated BW profiles to the same LSP. That is, an Ethernet
      SENDER_TSPEC MAY include multiple Ethernet Bandwidth Profile TLVs
      whose respective index can be associated on a 1:1 basis to a
      single CTi or to a set of multiple CTi.

      For each subobject of the extended Class-Type object [MCOS]:
      - each CTi value SHOULD correspond 1:1 to MEF CE VLAN-CoS
      - the BW requested per CTi field MAY be used for bandwidth
        accounting purposes.

      By default, the value of the index field MUST be set to 0.

   Reserved: 16 bits

      These bits SHOULD be set to zero when sent and MUST be ignored
      when received.

   CIR (Committed Information Rate): 32 bits

      The value of the CIR is in units of bytes per second. The CIR is
      encoded as a 32-bit IEEE single-precision floating-point number
      (see [RFC4506]).

      The CIR value MUST be greater than or equal to 0.

   CBS (Committed Burst Size): 32 bits

      The value of the CBS is in units of bytes. The CBS is encoded
      as a 32-bit IEEE single-precision floating-point number (see
      [RFC4506]).

      When CIR is strictly greater than 0 (CIR > 0), the CBS MUST be
      greater than or equal to the maximum frame size.

   EIR (Excess Information Rate): 32 bits

      The value of the EIR is in units of bytes per second. The EIR
      is encoded as a 32-bit IEEE single-precision floating-point
      number (see [RFC4506]).

      The EIR value MUST be greater than or equal to 0.

   EBS (Excess Burst Size): 32 bits

      The value of the EBS is in units of bytes. The EBS is encoded
      as a 32-bit IEEE single-precision floating-point number (see
      [RFC4506]).

      When EIR is strictly greater than 0 (EIR > 0), the EBS MUST be
      greater than or equal to the maximum frame size.

4. Ethernet FLOWSPEC Format

   The Ethernet FLOWSPEC object (Class-Num = 12, Class-Type = TBA by
   IANA - recommended value 6) has the same format as the Ethernet
   SENDER_TSPEC object.

5. ADSPEC Considerations

   There is no ADSPEC associated with the Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object.

   Either the ADSPEC is omitted or an Int-serv ADSPEC with the Default
   General Characterization Parameters and Guaranteed Service fragment
   is used, see [RFC2210].

6. Processing

   The Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object carries the traffic specification
   generated by the RSVP session sender. The Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC
   object SHOULD be forwarded and delivered unchanged to both
   intermediate and egress nodes.

   The Ethernet FLOWSPEC object carries reservation request information
   generated by receivers. As with any FLOWSPEC object, Ethernet
   FLOWSPEC object flows upstream toward the ingress node.

   Intermediate and egress nodes MUST verify that the node itself and
   the interfaces on which the LSP will be established can support the
   requested Switching Granularity, MTU and values included in sub-
   object TLVs. If the requested value(s) can not be supported, the
   receiver node MUST generate a PathErr message with the error code
   "Traffic Control Error" and the error value "Service unsupported"
   (see [RFC2205]).

   In addition, if the MTU field is received with a value smaller than
   the minimum transfer unit size of the Ethernet frame (e.g. 46 bytes
   for Ethernet v2, 38 bytes for IEEE 802.3), the node MUST generate a
   PathErr message with the error code "Traffic Control Error" and the
   error value "Bad Tspec value" (see [RFC2205]).

   Error processing of the Extended Class-Type object follows rules
   defined in [MCOS]. Moreover, an LSR receiving a Path message with the
   Extended Class-Type object, which recognizes the object and the
   particular Class-Type but does detect a mismatch in the index values,
   MUST send a PathErr towards the sender with the error code "Extended
   Class-Type Error" and the error value "Class-Type mismatch" (see
   [RFC2205]).

7. Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security considerations to either
   [RFC3473].

   GMPLS security is described in section 11 of [RFC3471] and refers to
   [RFC3209] for RSVP-TE. Further details of MPLS-TE and GMPLS security
   can be found in [MPLS-SEC].

8. IANA Considerations

   IANA maintain registries and sub-registries for RSVP-TE as used by
   GMPLS. IANA is requested to make allocations from these registries as
   set out in the following scetions.

8.1. RSVP Objects Class Types

   This document introduces two new Class Types for existing RSVP
   objects. IANA is requested to make allocations from the "Resource
   ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) Parameters" registry using the "Class
   Names, Class Numbers, and Class Types" sub-registry.

8.2. Ethernet Switching Granularities

   IANA maintains a registry of GMPLS parameters called "Generalized
   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Parameters". IANA is
   requested to create a new sub-registry called "Ethernet Switching
   Granularities" to contain the values that may be carried in the
   Switching Granularity field of the Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object.

   Values may be assigned as follows:

   -----    --------------------------------   ---------
     0      Reserved                           [This.I-D]
     1      Reserved                           [This.I-D]
     2      Ethernet Bandwidth Profile         [This.I-D]
     3      Layer 2 Control Processing (L2CP)  [This.I-D]
   255      Reserved                           [This.I-D]

8.4. Ethernet Bandwidth Profiles

   IANA maintains a registry of GMPLS parameters called "Generalized
   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Parameters". IANA is
   requested to create a new sub-registry called "Ethernet Bandwidth
   Profiles" to contain bit flags carried in the Ethernet Bandwidth
   Profile TLV of the Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object.

   Bits are to be allocated by IETF Standards Track RFC action.
   Bits are numbered from bit 0 as the low order bit.

   Bit   Hex   Description                   Reference
   ---   ----  --------------------------    -------------
     0   0x01  Coupling flag (CF)            [This.I-D]
     1   0x02  Color mode (CM)               [This.I-D]
