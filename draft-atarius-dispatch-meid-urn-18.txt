A Uniform Resource Name Namespace for the Device Identity and the Mobile
                       Equipment Identity (MEID)
                   draft-atarius-dispatch-meid-urn-18

Abstract

   This document defines a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace for the
   Third Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) and a Namespace
   Specific String (NSS) for the Mobile Equipment Identity (MEID).  The
   structure of an MEID is 15 hexadecimal digits long and is defined in
   the Third Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) (see [S.R0048-A])
   to uniquely identify each individual mobile equipment (e.g., a
   handset or mobile phone).  The 3GPP2 has a requirement to be able to
   use an MEID as a URN.  This document fulfills that requirement.

1.  Introduction

   A single mode 3GPP mobile equipment which uses only 3GPP technology
   to transmit and receive voice or data, or a dual mode 3GPP/3GPP2
   mobile equipment which uses either 3GPP or 3GPP2 technology to
   transmit and receive voice or data has an International Mobile
   station Equipment Identity (IMEI) to identify the mobile equipment.
   A URN Namespace and an NSS for the IMEI are defined in [RFC7254].
   For cases where the mobile equipment uses IMEI as an identity for

   dual mode 3GPP/3GPP2 access the IMEI urn as defined in [RFC7254] can
   be used to identify the mobile equipment.

   However, single mode 3GPP2 mobile equipment which supports only 3GPP2
   access technology to transmit and receive voice or data has a
   hexadecimal MEID.  Since there are fundamental differences between
   MEID and IMEI, i.e. in encoding, format and the ownership, [RFC7254]
   cannot be employed to represent the hexadecimal MEID.

   This document specifies a URN namespace for 3GPP2 and an NSS for the
   MEID as per the namespace registration requirement in [RFC8141].  The
   structure of an MEID is 15 hexadecimal encoded digits long and is
   defined by 3GPP2 (see [S.R0048-A]) to uniquely identify each
   individual mobile equipment (e.g., a handset or mobile phone).  The
   3GPP2 has a requirement to be able to use an MEID as a URN.  This
   document fulfills that requirement.  The Namespace Identifier (NID)
   '3gpp2' is for identities used in 3GPP2 networks.  The MEID is
   managed by the 3GPP2, so this NID is managed by the 3GPP2.  This
   specification defines only NSSs constructed from MEIDs under the
   '3gpp2' NID.  These NSSs start with "meid:" in order to identify them
   as such.  Additional types of NSS under the '3gpp2' NID may be
   specified in the future by the 3GPP2 via additional specifications.

   The MEID is 15 hexadecimal digits long and includes a manufacturer
   code of 8 hexadecimal digits and the serial number of 6 hexadecimal
   digits plus a hexadecimal digit as a check digit.

   The manufacturer code identifies the mobile equipment manufacturer.
   A manufacturer can be assigned more than one manufacturer code.  The
   serial number uniquely identifies each mobile equipment within the
   manufacturer code.  The check digit is used as assurance of integrity
   in error-prone operations, e.g. when used with certain types of
   readers during inventory management operations.  The check digit is
   not transmitted.  Therefore the first 14 of the 15 dexadecimal digits
   are used for defining the MEID as a URN.

   The information here is meant to be a concise guide for those wishing
   to use the hexadecimal MEID as a URN.  Nothing in this document
   should be construed to override [S.R0048-A] that defines the MEID.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.5.  Purpose

   The '3gpp2' namespace is used to identify mobile equipment which uses
   technologies defined by the Third Generation Partnership Project 2
   ((3GPP2); initially such equipment is identified by a URN that embeds
   a Mobile Equipment Identity (MEID) that is 15 hexadecimal digits long
   and unique to each individual mobile equipment (e.g., a handset or
   mobile phone).

3.6.  Syntax

   The identifier is expressed in American Standard Code for Information
   Interchange (ASCII) characters and has a hierarchical expression
   using the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) defined in [RFC5234], as
   follows:

   pp2-urn              = "urn:" pp2-NID ":" pp2-NSS
   pp2-NID              = "3gpp2"
   pp2-NSS              = meid-specifier / future-pp2-specifier
   meid-specifier       = "meid:" meidval
   future-pp2-specifier = future-specifier *[ ":" 1*( pchar / "/" ]
   future-specifier     = 1*pp2-char
   pp2-char             = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / pct-encoded

   where 'pchar' and 'pct-encoded' are defined in [RFC3986].  An NSS for
   the MEID is defined under the '3gpp2' NID.

   The representation of the MEID is a specific number of hexadecimal
   digits, as described in [S.R0048-A].

   The formal definition of a URN with 'meid' NSS contains one meidval
   with the formal definition according to the following ABNF [RFC5234]:

   meidval           = Manufacturer-Code "-" Serial-Number
   Manufacturer-Code = 8HEX
   Serial-Number     = 6HEX
   HEX               = DIGIT / "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F"

3.7.  Assignment

   The Manufacturer Code and Serial Number portions of the MEID are
   permanently stored in the mobile equipment so they remain persistent
   as long as the mobile equipment exists.  The process for Manufacturer
   Code and Serial Number assignment is documented in [SC.R4002-0] and
   the Manufacturer Code and Serial Number values once assigned are not
   re-assigned to other mobile equipments.

   Identifiers in the '3gpp2' namespace are defined and assigned by the
   3GPP2 or an agency appointed by 3GPP2 after ensuring that the URNs to
   be assigned are unique.  Procedures are in place to ensure that each
   MEID is uniquely assigned by the mobile equipment manufacturer so
   that it is guaranteed to uniquely identify that particular mobile
   equipment.

3.8.  Security and Privacy

   See Section 8 of RFC XXXX.

3.9.  Interoperability

   Although both the 3GPP2 Mobile Equipment Identity (MEID) and the 3GPP
   International Mobile station Equipment Identity (IMEI) are used to
   identity mobile equipment, they are separate identifiers and are not
   to be confused.

Internet-Draft               MEID Based URN                    June 2018


   Internet implementations will not generally possess MEID identifiers.
   The identifiers generated by such implementations will typically be
   URNs within namespaces other than '3gpp2', and may, depending on
   context, even be non-URN URIs.  Implementations are advised to be
   ready to process URIs other than '3gpp2' namespaced URNs, so as to
   aid in interoperability.

3.10.  Resolution

   No resolution is envisioned.

3.11.  Documentation

   Documentation can be found in the following specifications:

   o  A Uniform Resource Name Namespace for the Device Identity and the
      Mobile Equipment Identity (MEID)" [RFC XXXX].

   o  3G Mobile Equipment Identifier [S.R0048-A].

   o  GHA (Global Hexadecimal Administrator) Assignment Guidelines and
      Procedures for Mobile Equipment Identifier (MEID) and Short Form
      Expanded UIM Identifier (SF_EUIMID) [SC.R4002-0].

3.12.  Additional Information:

   Because the syntax of a 3GPP2 Mobile Equipment Identity (MEID)
   differs from that of a 3GPP International Mobile station Equipment
   Identity (IMEI), reuse of the URN specified in RFC 7254 is not
   possible.

4.  Specification

4.1.  MEID Parameters

   Any future change to the format of the 'meid' NSS requires the use of
   the procedure for URN NSS changes (currently through the publication
   of a future Informational RFCs approved by IETF consensus).

   [draft-atarius-dispatch-meid-urn-as-instanceid] specifies how the
   MEID URN can be used as an instance ID as specified in [RFC5626].
   Any change to the instance ID, will require an update to
   [draft-atarius-dispatch-meid-urn-as-instanceid].  An example of 3GPP2
   MEID URN is:

   urn:3gpp2:meid:A04B0D56-02A7E3

4.2.  MEID Format

4.2.1.  Overview

   The MEID format is 15 hexadecimal digits encoded in 8 octets as
   defined in [S.R0048-A].  The first eight hexadecimal digits
   constitute the manufacturer code, the next six hexadecimal digits the
   serial number within the manufacturer code.  The last hexadecimal
   digit is a check digit.  For more details on the hexadecimal encoding
   c.f. 4.2.5.

4.2.2.  Manufacturer Code

   The manufacturer code is an 8 hexadecimal digit value.  The
   manufacturer code identifies the mobile equipment manufacturer.  The
   manufacturer code is chosen from a range of values allocated to the
   mobile equipment manufacturer in order to uniquely identify the
   mobile equipment.

4.2.3.  Serial Number

   The serial number is a 6 hexadecimal digit value.  The serial number
   identifies equipment within the manufacturer code.

4.2.4.  Check Digit

   This is a single hexadecimal digit (bits 1-4 of octet 8) and is used
   as assurance of integrity in error-prone operations, e.g. when used
   with certain types of readers during inventory management operations.
   The check digit is not transmitted by the mobile equipment and are
   not used in the MEID URN.

4.2.5.  Hexadecimal Encoding

   The MEID format is 15 hexadecimal digits encoded in 8 octets as
   defined in [S.R0048-A].  The following figure is an abstract
   representation of a hexadecimal encoded MEID stored in memory (the
   actual storage format in memory is implementation specific).  In this
   figure, the most significant digit of the Manufacturer Code is
   encoded in the bits 1-4 of octet 1.  Bits 5-8 of octet 8 are zero-
   padded, since the bits 1-4 are only needed to encode the Check Digit.
   The most significant digit of the Serial Number is encoded in the
   bits 1-4 of octet 5.  When MEID is included in a cellular signaling
   message, the Check Digit is omitted and the first 7 Octets in the
   following figure are only transmitted, [X.S0008-A].

5.  IANA Considerations

   In accordance with BCP 66 [RFC8141], IANA is asked to register the
   Formal URN namespace '3gpp2' in the "Uniform Resource Name (URN)
   Namespaces" registry, using the registration template presented in
   Section 3 of this document.

6.  Security and Privacy Considerations

   An MEID is usually printed outside of the box, a mobile device ships
   in.  The MEID may also be printed under the battery on a mobile
   device, however very few devices have removable batteries today.  One
   can retrieve the MEID via either settings or by dialing *#06#.
   Anyone with brief physical access to the mobile device or its box can
   therefore easily obtain the MEID.  Therefore MEIDs MUST NOT be used
   as security capabilities (identifiers whose mere possession grants
   access).  Unfortunately there are currently examples of some
   applications which are using the MEID for authorization.  Also some
   service providers' customer service departments have been known to
   use knowledge of the MEID as "proof" that the caller is the
   legitimate owner of the mobile device.  Both of these are
   inappropriate uses of the MEID.

   Since the MEID is permanently assigned to the mobile equipment and is
   not modified when the ownership of the mobile equipment changes,
   (even upon a complete software reload of the mobile equipment), the
   MEID URN MUST NOT be used as a user identifier or user address by an
   application.  Using the MEID to identify a user or as a user address
   could result in communications destined for a previous owner of a
   device being received by the new device owner or could allow the new
   device owner to access information or services owned by the previous
   device owner.

   Additionally, since the MEID identifies the mobile equipment, it
   potentially could be used to identify and track users for the
   purposes of surveillance and call data mining if sent in the clear.

Internet-Draft               MEID Based URN                    June 2018


   Since the MEID is personally identifiable information, uses of the
   MEID URN with IETF protocols require a specification and IETF expert
   review [RFC5226] in order to ensure that the privacy concerns are
   appropriately addressed.  Protocols carrying the MEID URN SHOULD at a
   minimum use strongly hop-by-hop encrypted channels and that it is
   RECOMMENDED that end-to-end encryption is used.
