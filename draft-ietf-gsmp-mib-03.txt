1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects for the General Switch
   Management Protocol (GSMP).

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  The SNMP Management Framework


   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   *     An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

   *     Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
         purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
         Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD
         16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 1215
         [RFC1215]. The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD
         58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and RFC 2580[RFC2580].

   *     Message protocols for transferring management information. The
         first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
         described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second version of the
         SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
         protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901]
         and RFC 1906 [RFC1906]. The third version of the message protocol
         is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906], RFC 2572
         [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

   *     Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
         first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
         described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second set of
         operations and associated PDU formats is described in 1905
         [RFC1905].

   *     A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [RFC2573]
         and the view-based access control mechanism described RFC 2575
         [RFC2575].

  A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
  can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
  the Management Information Base or MIB. Objects in the MIB are
  defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

  This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
  MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
  translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
  equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
  translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
  information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
  SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
  readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
  MIB.

3.  Structure of the MIB

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects for the General Switch
   Management Protocol (GSMP) as defined in [GSMPv3].

3.1  Scope

   The GSMP mib is a protocol mib. It contains object to configure,
   monitor and maintain the GSMP protocol agent. It does not provide any
   information learned via the protocol, such as "all ports config"
   information.

   The relationships between virtual entities, such as Virtual Switch
   Entities, and entities, such as Switch Entities, falls outside of the
   management of GSMP. This also applies for the management of switch
   partitions. So this is excluded from the GSMP mib.

   It is possible to configure which and how many Switch Controllers
   that are controlling one Switch since every potential session with
   the switch has to be represented with an Switch entity. It is however
   not possible to define that one Switch Controller shouldn't allow
   other Switch controllers to control the same switch or partition on
   the switch. It is assumed that there are mechanisms that synchronise
   controllers and the configuration of them. This is outside the scope
   of this mib.

3.2  Overview

   Each instance of a switch controller - switch partition adjacency is
   a session between a switch controller entity and a switch entity. The
   MIB provides objects to configure/setup these entities to form the
   GSMP sessions.

   Two tables are used to configure potential GSMP sessions depending if
   you are acting as a GSMP switch controller or a GSMP switch. Each row
   in these tables initiates a GSMP session. To create a Switch Entity,
   an entry in the gsmpSwitchTable is created. To create a Switch
   Controller Entity, an entry in the gsmpControllerTable is created.

   In order to define and configure what encapsulation the potential
   GSMP session shall use, the gsmpControllerEncapType or
   gsmpSwitchEncapType object in the respective tables is set to
   ethernet, atm or tcp/ip. If atm is used, a row in the
   gsmpAtmEncapTable has to be created with the same index as in the
   controller or switch table. If tcp/ip is used, a row in the

Internet Draft                   GSMP MIB                  November 2000

   gsmpTcpIpEncapTable has to be created with the same index as in the
   controller or switch table. No extra encapsulation info is needed if
   ethernet is used.

   Another table, the gsmpSessionTable, shows the actual sessions that
   are established or are in the process of being established.  Each row
   represents a specific session between an Entity and a peer. This
   table carries information about the peer, the session and parameters
   that was negotiated by the adjacency procedures.  The
   gsmpSessionTable also contains statistical information regarding the
   session.

3.3  MIB groups

3.3.1  GSMP Switch Controller group

   The controller group is used to configure a potential GSMP session on
   a Switch Controller. A row in the gsmpControllerTable is created for
   each such session. If ATM or TCP/IP encapsulation is used a
   corresponding row has to be created in these tables before the
   session adjacency protocol is initiated.

   The encapsulation used is specified in the gsmpControllerEncapType
   object. If ATM or TCP/IP is used, further encapsulation data is
   defined in the corresponding encapsulation tables. If ethernet is
   used the MAC address of the interface defined for the session is set
   by the Controller ID object.

   The adjacency parameters are defined; such as
   - Max supported GSMP version
   ¡ Time between the periodic adjacency messages
   ¡ Controller local port number and instance number.
   ¡ Whether partitions are being used and the partition ID for the
     specific partitions this controller is concerned with if
     partitions are used.
   ¡ The resynchronisation strategy for the session is specified.

   The notification mapping is set to specify for with events the
   corresponding SNMP notifications are sent.

3.3.2  GSMP Switch group

   The switch group is used to configure a potential GSMP session on a
   Switch. A row in the gsmpSwitchTable is created for each such
   session. If ATM or TCP/IP encapsulation is used a corresponding row
   has to be created in these tables before the session adjacency
   protocol is initiated.

Internet Draft                   GSMP MIB                  November 2000

   The encapsulation used is specified in the gsmpSwitchEncapType
   object. If ATM or TCP/IP is used, further encapsulation data is
   defined in the corresponding encapsulation tables. If ethernet is
   used the MAC address of the interface defined for the session is set
   by the Switch ID object.

   The adjacency parameters are defined; such as
   - Max supported GSMP version
   ¡ Time between the periodic adjacency messages
   ¡ Switch Name, local port number and instance number.
   ¡ Whether partitions are being used and the partition ID for this
     specific partition if partitions are used.
   - The switch type could be set.
   - The suggested maximum window size for unacknowledged request
     messages.

   Also, a notification mapping is set to specify for with events the
   corresponding SNMP notifications are sent.

3.3.3  GSMP Encapsulation groups

   The ATM Encapsulation Table and the TCP/IP Encapsulation Table
   provides a way to configure information that are encapsulation
   specific. The encapsulation data is further specified in [GSMPenc].

   If ATM encapsulation is used, the interface and the virtual channel
   are specified.

   If TCP/IP is used, the IP address (or DNS address) and the port
   number are specified.

   No special config data needed if Ethernet encapsulation is used.

3.3.4  GSMP General group

   The GSMP session table provides a way to monitor and maintain GSMP
   sessions.

   The session is defined by a Switch Controller Entity and Switch
   Entity pair.

3.3.5  The GSMP Notifications Group

   The GSMP Notification Group defines notifications for GSMP entities.
   These notifications provide a mechanism for a GSMP device to inform
   the management station of status changes. Also a notification is
   defined for each type of GSMP events. To disable or enable sending of
   each notification is done by setting the bitmap accordingly in the

  Notification mapping objects in the Controller Entity or Switch
  Entity tables.

  The group of notifications consists of the following notifications:

  - gsmpSessionDownTrap

  This notification is generated when a session is terminating and also
  reports the final accounting statistics of the session.

  - gsmpSessionUpTrap

  This notification is generated when a new session is established.

  - gsmpSendFailureIndTrap

  This notification is generated when a message with a failure
  indication was sent. This means that this notification identifies a
  change to the gsmpSessionStatFailureIndication object in a row of
  the gsmpSessionTable.

  - gsmpReceivedFailureIndTrap

  This notification is generated when a message with a failure
  indication received. This means that this notification identifies a
  change to the gsmpSessionStatReceivedFailure object in a row of the
  gsmpSessionTable.

  - gsmpPortUpEventTrap

  This notification is generated when a Port Up Event is either
  received or sent.

  - gsmpPortDownEventTrap

  This notification is generated when a Port Down Event is either
  received or sent.

  - gsmpInvalidLabelEventTrap

  This notification is generated when an Invalid Label Event is either
  received or sent.

  - gsmpNewPortEventTrap

  This notification is generated when New Port Event either is received
  or sent.

  - gsmpDeadPortEventTrap

Internet Draft                   GSMP MIB                  November 2000

   This notification is generated when a Dead Port Event is either
   received or sent.

   - gsmpAdjacencyUpdateEventTrap

   This notification is generated when an Adjacency Update Event is
   either received or sent.

3.4  Textual Conventions

   The datatypes GsmpNameType, GsmpPartitionType, GsmpPartitionIdType
   and GsmpEncapType are used as textual conventions in this document.
   These textual conventions have NO effect on neither the syntax nor
   the semantics of any managed object. Objects defined using these
   conventions are always encoded by means of the rules that define
   their primitive type. Hence, no changes to the SMI or the SNMP are
   necessary to accommodate these textual conventions which are adopted
   merely for the convenience of readers.

              generated whenever a session is taken down, regardless

              Its purpose is to allow a management application

              monitoring the session statistics to receive the final

              properly account for the amounts the counters were
              incremented since the last time the application polled
              them. The gsmpSessionStatUptime object provides the
              total amount of time that the session was active.

              This notification is not a substitute for polling the
              session statistic counts. In particular, the count
              values reported in this notification cannot be assumed
              to be the complete totals for the life of the session,
              since they may have wrapped while the
              session was up.

              The session to which the objects in this notification
              apply is identified by the session gsmpThisSideId,
              gsmpFarSideId objects.
              An instance of this notification will contain exactly
              one instance of each of its objects, and these objects
              will all belong to the same conceptual row of the

8.  Security Considerations

   Assuming that secure network management (such as SNMP v3) is
   implemented, the objects represented in this MIB do not pose a threat
   to the security of the network.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments. The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain
   sensitive information. These are contained in the gsmpSwitchTable and
   gsmpControllerTable. It is thus important to control even GET access to
   these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these object
   when sending them over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of
   SNMP provide features for such a secure environment.

   SNMPv2 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-
   based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
