                  YANG Data Model for Segment Routing
                      draft-ietf-spring-sr-yang-11

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG data model ([RFC6020], [RFC7950]) for
   segment routing ([RFC8402]) configuration and operation.  This YANG
   model is intended to be used on network elements to configure or
   operate segment routing.  This document defines also generic
   containers that SHOULD be reused by IGP protocol modules to support
   segment routing.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG data model for segment routing
   configuration and operation.  This document does not define the IGP
   extensions to support segment routing but defines generic groupings
   that SHOULD be reused by IGP extension modules.  The reason of this
   design choice is to not require implementations to support all IGP
   extensions.  For example, an implementation may support IS-IS
   extension but not OSPF.

   The YANG modules in this document conform to the Network Management
   Datastore Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342].

2.  Terminology and Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.1.  Tree diagram

   Tree diagrams used in this document follow the notation defined in
   [RFC8340].

2.2.  Prefixes in Data Node Names

   In this document, names of data nodes, actions, and other data model
   objects are often used without a prefix, as long as it is clear from
   the context in which YANG module each name is defined.  Otherwise,
   names are prefixed using the standard prefix associated with the
   corresponding YANG module, as shown in Table 1.

               +----------+--------------------+-----------+
               | Prefix   | YANG module        | Reference |
               +----------+--------------------+-----------+

               | rt       | ietf-routing       | [RFC8349] |
               | rt-types | ietf-routing-types | [RFC8294] |
               | yang     | ietf-yang-types    | [RFC6991] |

   As the module definition is just starting, it is expected that there
   will be changes as the module matures.

4.  Configuration

   This module augments the "/rt:routing:" with a segment-routing
   container.  This container defines all the configuration parameters
   related to segment-routing.

   The segment-routing configuration is split in global configuration
   and interface configuration.

   The global configuration includes :

   o  segment-routing transport type : The underlying transport type for
      segment routing.  The version of the model limits the transport



Litkowski, et al.        Expires August 19, 2019                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                 sr-yang-cfg                 February 2019


      type to an MPLS dataplane.  The transport-type is only defined
      once for a particular routing-instance and is agnostic to the
      control plane used.  Only a single transport-type is supported in
      this version of the model.

   o  bindings : Defines prefix to SID mappings.  The operator can
      control advertisement of Prefix-SID independently for IPv4 and
      IPv6.  Two types of mappings are available :

      *  Mapping-server : maps non local prefixes to a segment ID.
         Configuration of bindings does not automatically allow
         advertisement of those bindings.  Advertisement must be
         controlled by each routing-protocol instance (see Section 5).
         Multiple mapping policies may be defined.

      *  Connected prefixes : maps connected prefixes to a segment ID.
         Advertisement of the mapping will be done by IGP when enabled
         for segment routing (see Section 5).  The SID value can be
         expressed as an index (default), or an absolute value.  The
         "last-hop-behavior" configuration dictates the PHP behavior:
         "explicit-null", "php", or "non-php".

   o  SRGB (Segment Routing Global Block): Defines a list of label
      blocks represented by a pair of lower-bound/upper-bound labels.
      The SRGB is also agnostic to the control plane used.  So all
      routing-protocol instance will have to advertise the same SRGB.

   o  SRLB (Segment Routing Local Block): Defines a list of label blocks
      represented by a pair of lower-bound/upper-bound labels, reserved
      for lcoal SIDs.

5.  IGP Control plane configuration

   Support of segment-routing extensions for a particular IGP control
   plane is done by augmenting routing-protocol configuration with
   segment-routing extensions.  This augmentation SHOULD be part of
   separate YANG modules in order to not create any dependency for
   implementations to support all protocol extensions.

   This module defines groupings that SHOULD be used by IGP segment
   routing modules.

   The "controlplane-cfg" grouping defines the generic global
   configuration for the IGP.

   The "enabled" leaf enables segment-routing extensions for the
   routing-protocol instance.

   The "bindings" container controls the routing-protocol instance's
   advertisement of local bindings and the processing of received
   bindings.

5.1.  IGP interface configuration

   The interface configuration is part of the "igp-interface-cfg"
   grouping and includes Adjacency SID properties.

5.1.1.  Adjacency SID properties

5.1.1.1.  Bundling

   This section is a first proposal on how to use S-bit in Adj-SID to
   create bundles.  Authors would like to trigger discussion based on
   this first proposal.

   In case of parallel IP links between routers, an additional Adjacency
   SID may be advertised representing more than one adjacency (i.e., a
   bundle of adjacencies).  The "advertise-adj-group-sid" configuration
   controls whether or not an additional adjacency SID is advertised.

   The "advertise-adj-group-sid" would be a list of "group-id".  The
   "group-id" will permit to identify interfaces that must be bundled
   together.


           +-------+                 +------+
           |       | ------- L1 ---- |      |
           |   R1  | ------- L2 ---- |  R2  |
           |       | ------- L3 ---- |      |
           |       | ------- L4 ---- |      |
           +-------+                 +------+

   In the figure above, R1 and R2 are interconnected by four links.  A
   routing protocol adjacency is established on each link.  Operator
   would like to create segment-routing Adj-SID that represent some
   bundles of links.  We can imagine two different bundles : L1/L2 and
   L2/L3.  To achieve this behavior, the service provider will configure
   a "group-id" X for both interfaces L1 and L2 and a "group-id" Y for
   both interfaces L3 and L3.  This will result in R1 advertising an
   additional Adj-SID for each adjacency, for example a Adj-SID with S
   flag set and value of 400 will be added to L1 and L2.  A Adj-SID with
   S flag set and value of 500 will be added to L3 and L4.  As L1/L2 and
   L3/L4 does not share the same "group-id", a different SID value will
   be allocated.

5.1.1.2.  Protection

   The "advertise-protection" defines how protection for an interface is
   advertised.  It does not control the activation or deactivation of
   protection.  If the "single" option is used, a single Adj-SID will be
   advertised for the interface.  If the interface is protected, the
   B-Flag for the Adj-SID advertisement will be set.  If the "dual"
   option is used and if the interface is protected, two Adj-SIDs will
   be advertised for the interface adjacencies.  One Adj-SID will always
   have the B-Flag set and the other will have the B-Flag clear.  This
   option is intended to be used in the case of traffic engineering
   where a path must use either protected segments or non-protected
   segments.

6.  States

   The operational states contains information reflecting the usage of
   allocated SRGB labels.

   It also includes a list of all global SIDs, their associated
   bindings, and other information such as the source protocol and
   algorithm.

7.  Notifications

   The model defines the following notifications for segment-routing.

   o  segment-routing-global-srgb-collision: Rasied when a control plan
      advertised SRGB blocks have conflicts.

   o  segment-routing-global-sid-collision: Raised when a control plane
      advertised index is already associated with another target (in
      this version, the only defined targets are IPv4 and IPv6
      prefixes).

   o  segment-routing-index-out-of-range: Raised when a control plane
      advertised index fall outside the range of SRGBs configured for
      the network device.
