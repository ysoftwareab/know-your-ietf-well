1  Overview

                   Use of the AES Algorithm in CMS      November 2000


   This document presents the use of the two algorithms together, and we
   anticipate that they will be used together.  However,the two
   algorithms can be used independently.  For example, RSA-OAEP could be
   used to transport Triple-DES keys, and AES keys could be distributed
   out-of-band for use with mail lists.  The two algorithms are
   presented together simply because the initial usage of each will be
   as a matched pair.

1.1  AES

   The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is being developed to replace
   DES [DES].  The AES will be a new Federal Information Processing
   Standard (FIPS) Publication that will specify a cryptographic
   algorithm for use by U.S. Government organizations.  However, the AES
   will also be widely used by organizations, institutions, and
   individuals outside of the U.S. Government.

   NIST has posted the Draft FIPS for the AES (see
   http://csrc.nist.gov/encryption/aes).  The AES will become official
   after a 90-day public comment period, NIST makes appropriate changes
   to the Draft FIPS, and the Secretary of Commerce approves the FIPS.
   Current estimates place this sometime in the summer of 2001.  In
   other words, any day now.

   The two researchers who developed and submitted the Rijndael
   algorithm for the AES are both cryptographers from Belgium: Dr. Joan
   Daemen of Proton World International and Dr. Vincent Rijmen, a
   postdoctoral researcher in the Electrical Engineering Department of
   Katholieke Universiteit Leuven.

   NIST selected the Rijndael algorithm for AES because it offers a
   combination of security, performance, efficiency, ease of
   implementation, and flexibility.  Specifically, Rijndael appears to
   be consistently a very good performer in both hardware and software
   across a wide range of computing environments regardless of its use
   in feedback or non-feedback modes.  Its key setup time is excellent,
   and its key agility is good.  The very low memory requirements of the
   Rijndael algorithm make it very well suited for restricted-space
   environments, in which it also demonstrates excellent performance.
   The Rijndael algorith operations are among the easiest to defend
   against power and timing attacks.  Additionally, it appears that some
   defense can be provided against such attacks without significantly
   impacting the algorithm's performance.  Finally, the algorithm's
   internal round structure appears to have good potential to benefit
   from instruction-level parallelism.

   The AES specifies three key sizes: 128, 192 and 256 bits.

1.2  RSA-OAEP

   When the variant of the RSA key transport algorithm specified in PKCS
   #1 Version 1.5 [PKCS#1v1.5] is used for key management, it is
   vulnerable to adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks.  This attack is
   described in [RSALAB] and [CRYPTO98].  The use of PKCS #1 Version 1.5
 Schaad, Housley                2
                   Use of the AES Algorithm in CMS      November 2000


   key transport in interactive applications is especially vulnerable.
   Exploitation of this identified vulnerability, revealing the result
   of a particular RSA decryption, requires access to an oracle which
   will respond to hundreds of thousands of ciphertexts, which are
   constructed adaptively in response to previously-received replies
   providing information on the successes or failures of attempted
   decryption operations.

   The attack appears significantly less feasible in store-and-forward
   environments, such as S/MIME.  When PKCS #1 Version 1.5 key transport
   is applied as an intermediate encryption layer within an interactive
   request-response communications environment, exploitation could be
   more feasible.  However, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) [SSL] and
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) [TLS] protocol implementations could
   include countermeasures that detect and prevent Bleichenbacher's and
   other chosen-ciphertext attacks, without changing the way the RSA key
   transport algorithm is used.  These countermeasures are performed
   within the protocol level.  In the interest of long-term security
   assurance, it is prudent to adopt an improved cryptographic technique
   rather than embedding countermeasures within protocols.

   An updated version of PKCS #1 has been published, PKCS #1 Version 2.0
   [PKCS#1v2.0].  This new document supersedes RFC 2313 [PKCS#1v1.5].
   PKCS #1 Version 2.0 preserves support for the encryption padding
   format defined in PKCS #1 Version 1.5 [PKCS#1v1.5], and it also
   defines a new alternative.  To resolve the adaptive chosen ciphertext
   vulnerability, the PKCS #1 Version 2.0 specifies and recommends use
   of Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP) when RSA encryption
   is used to provide confidentiality, such as key transport.

   This document specifies the use of RSAES-OAEP key transport algorithm
   in the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [CMS].  CMS can be used in
   either a store-and-forward or an interactive request-response
   environment.

   CMS supports variety of architectures for certificate-based key
   management, particularly the one defined by the PKIX working group
   [PROFILE].  PKCS #1 Version 1.5 and PKCS #1 Version 2.0 require the
   same RSA public key information.  Thus, a certified RSA public key
   may be used with either RSA key transport technique.

   CMS values are generated using ASN.1 [X.208-88], using the Basic
   Encoding Rules (BER) [X.209-88] and the Distinguished Encoding Rules
   (DER) [X.509-88].

2  Enveloped-data Conventions

   The CMS enveloped-data content type consists of encrypted content and
   wrapped content-encryption keys for one or more recipients.  The
   RSAES-OAEP key transport algorithm is used to wrap the content-
   encryption key for one recipient.  The AES algorithm is used to
   encrypt the content.


 Schaad, Housley                3
                   Use of the AES Algorithm in CMS      November 2000


   Compliant software MUST meet the requirements for constructing an
   enveloped-data content type stated in [CMS] Section 6, "Enveloped-
   data Content Type".

   A content-encryption key MUST be randomly generated for each instance
   of an enveloped-data content type.  The content-encryption key is
   used to encipher the content.

   AES can be used with the enveloped-data content type using any of the
   following key management techniques defined in [CMS] Section 6.

   1) Key Transport: The AES CEK is uniquely wrapped for each recipient
   using the recipient's public RSA key and other values.  Section 2.2
   provides additional details.

   2) Key Agreement: The AES CEK is uniquely wrapped for each recipient
   using a pairwise symmetric key-encryption key (KEK) generated using
   DH-ES using the a randomly generated private key value for the
   originator, the recipient's public DH key and other values.  Section
   2.3 provides additional details.

   3) "Previously Distributed" Symmetric KEK:  The AES CEK is wrapped
   using a "previously distributed" symmetric KEK (such as a Mail List
   Key).  The methods by which the symmetric KEK is generated and
   distributed are beyond the scope of this document.  Section 2.4
   provides additional details.

   4) Password Encryption:  The AES CEK is wrapped using a KEK derived
   from a password or other shared-secret value.  Section 2.5 provides
   additional details.

2.1  EnvelopedData Fields

   The enveloped-data content type is ASN.1 encoded using the
   EnvelopedData syntax.  The fields of the EnvelopedData syntax must be
   populated as follows:

   The EnvelopedData version is determined based on a number of factors.
   See [CMS] section 6.1 for the algorithm to determine this value.

   The EnvelopedData originatorInfo field is not used for the RSAES-OAEP
   key transport algorithm.  However, this field MAY be present to
   support recipients using other key management algorithms.

   The EnvelopedData recipientInfos CHOICE is dependent on the key
   management technique used.  Section 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 provide
   additional information.

   The EnvelopedData encryptedContentInfo contentEncryptionAlgorithm
   field MUST specify a symmetric encryption algorithm.  Implementations
   MUST support the encryption of AES keys, but implementations MAY
   support other algorithms as well.

   The EnvelopedData unprotectedAttrs MAY be present.
 Schaad, Housley                4
                   Use of the AES Algorithm in CMS      November 2000



2.2  KeyTransRecipientInfo Fields

   The enveloped-data content type is ASN.1 encoded using the
   EnvelopedData syntax.  The fields of the EnvelopedData syntax MUST be
   populated as follows:

   The KeyTransRecipientInfo version MUST be either 0 or 2.  If the
   RecipientIdentifier is the CHOICE issuerAndSerialNumber, then the
   version MUST be 0.  If the RecipientIdentifier is
   subjectKeyIdentifier, then the version MUST be 2.

   The KeyTransRecipientInfo RecipientIdentifier provides two
   alternatives for specifying the recipient's certificate, and thereby
   the recipient's public key.  The recipient's certificate must contain
   a RSA public key.  The content-encryption key is encrypted with the
   recipient's RSA public key.  The issuerAndSerialNumber alternative
   identifies the recipient's certificate by the issuer's distinguished
   name and the certificate serial number; the subjectKeyIdentifier
   identifies the recipient's certificate by the X.509
   subjectKeyIdentifier extension value.

   The KeyTransRecipientInfo keyEncryptionAlgorithm field specifies the
   RSAES-OAEP algorithm, and the associated parameters used to encrypt
   the content-encryption key for the recipient.  The key-encryption
   process is described in [PKCS#1v2.0].  See section 4.1 of this
   document for the algorithm identifier and the parameter syntax.

   The KeyTransRecipientInfo encryptedKey is the result of encrypting
   the content-encryption key in the recipient's RSA public key using
   the RSAES-OAEP algorithm.

   Note: When using a Triple-DES content-encryption key, implementations
   MUST adjust the parity bits for each DES key comprising the Triple-
   DES key prior to RSAES-OAEP encryption.

2.3  KeyAgreeRecipientInfo Fields

   This section describes the conventions for using ES-DH and AES with
   the CMS enveloped-data content type to support key agreement.  When
   key agreement is used, then the RecipientInfo keyAgreeRecipientInfo
   CHOICE MUST be used.

   The KeyAgreeRecipient version MUST be 3.

   The EnvelopedData originatorInfo field must be the originatorKey
   alternative.  The originatoryKey algorithm fields MUST contain the
   dh-public-number object identifier with absent parameters.  The
   originatorKey publicKey MUST contain the senderÆs ephemeral public
   key.

   The EnvelopedData ukm MAY be absent.


 Schaad, Housley                5
                   Use of the AES Algorithm in CMS      November 2000


   The EnvelopedData keyEncrytionAlgorithm MUST be the id-alg-ESDH
   algorithm identifier.

2.3.1  ES-DH/AES Key Derivation

   Generation of the an AES key used in doing AES-KeyWrap is done using
   the method in [DH] with the following modifications:

   The Hash function H will be [SHA-256] rather than SHA-1.

2.3.1.1  Example 1

   ZZ is the 20 bytes 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09
                      0a 0b 0c 0d 0e 0f 10 11 12 13

   The key wrap algorithm is AES-128 wrap, so we need 128 bits (20
   bytes) of keying material.

   No partyAInfo is used.

   Consequently, the input to the first invocation of SHA-256 is:

   00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0a 0b 0c 0d 0e 0f 10 11 12 13 ; ZZ
   30 1d
      30 13
         06 0b TBS          ; AES-128 wrap OID
         04 04
            00 00 00 01                                        ; Counter
      a2 06
         04 04
         00 00 00 80                                        ; key length

   And the output is the 32 bytes:

   TBS

   Consenquently,

   K=TBS

2.3.1.2  Example 2

   ZZ is the 20 bytes 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09
                      0a 0b 0c 0d 0e 0f 10 11 12 13

   The key wrap algorithm is AES-256 key wrap, so we need 256 bits (32
   bytes) of keying material.

   The partyAInfo used is the 64 bytes

   01 23 45 67 89 ab cd ef fe dc ba 98 76 54 32 01
   01 23 45 67 89 ab cd ef fe dc ba 98 76 54 32 01
   01 23 45 67 89 ab cd ef fe dc ba 98 76 54 32 01
   01 23 45 67 89 ab cd ef fe dc ba 98 76 54 32 01
 Schaad, Housley                6
                   Use of the AES Algorithm in CMS      November 2000



   Consequently, the input to SHA-256 is:

   00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0a 0b 0c 0d 0e 0f 10 11 12 13 ; ZZ
   30 61
      30 13
         06 0b TBS           ; AES-256 wrap OID
         04 04
            00 00 00 01                                        ; Counter
      a0 42
         04 40
            01 23 45 67 89 ab cd ef fe dc ba 98 76 54 32 01 ; partyAInfo
            01 23 45 67 89 ab cd ef fe dc ba 98 76 54 32 01
            01 23 45 67 89 ab cd ef fe dc ba 98 76 54 32 01
            01 23 45 67 89 ab cd ef fe dc ba 98 76 54 32 01
      a2 06
         04 04
            00 00 01 00                                     ; key length

   And the output is the 32 bytes:

   TBS

   Consequently,

   K=TBS

2.3.2  AES CEK Wrap Process

   To be supplied.

2.4  KEKRecipientInfo Fields

   This section describes the conventions for using AES with the CMS
   enveloped-data content type to support previously distributed
   symmetric KEKs.  When a previously distributed symmetric KEK is used
   to wrap the AES CEK, then the RecipientInfo KEKRecipientInfo CHOICE
   MUST be used.  The methods used to generate and distribute the
   symmetric KEK are beyond the scope of this document.  One possible
   method of distributing keys is documented in [SYMKEYDIST].

   The KEKRecipientInfo fields MUST be populated as specified in [CMS]
   Section 6.2.3, KEKRecipientInfo Type.

   The KEKRecipientInfo keyEncryptionAlgorithm algorithm field MUST be
   the id-NIST-AES-KEY-WRAP OID indicating that the AES wrap function is
   used to wrap the AES CEK. The KEKRecipientInfo keyEncryptionAlgorithm
   parameters field MUST be absent.

   The KEKRecipientInfo encryptedKey field MUST include the AES CEK
   wrapped using the previously distributed symmetric KEK as input to
   the AES wrap function.

   To Be Decided û Do we have multiple sizes of key wrap algorithms.
 Schaad, Housley                7

2.5  PasswordRecipientInfo Fields

   To Be Provided

3  Encrypted-data Conventions

   The encrypted-data content type is ASN.1 encoded using the
   EncryptededData syntax.  The fields of the EncryptedData syntax MUST
   be populated as follows:

   The EncryptedData version is determined based on a number of factors.
   See [CMS] section 9.1 for the algorithm to determine this value.

   The EncryptedData encryptedContentInfo contentEncryptionAlgorithm
   field MUST specify a symmetric encryption algorithm.  Implementations
   MUST support the encryption of AES keys, but implementations MAY
   support other algorithms as well.

   The EncryptedData unprotectedAttrs MAY be present.



4  Algorithm Identifiers and Parameters
4.1  AES Algorithm Identifiers and Parameters

   The AES algorithm is defined in [AES].  RSA #1 v1.5 MUST NOT be used
   to transport AES keys.

   AES is added to the set of symmetric content encryption algorithms in
   CMS.  The AES content-encryption algorithm in Cipher Block Chaining
   (CBC) mode for the three different key sizes are identified by the
   OID:

       id-aes128-CBC OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { aes 2 }
       id-aes192-CBC OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { aes 22 }
       id-aes256-CBC OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { aes 42 }

   The AlgorithmIdentifier parameters field MUST be present, and the
   parameters field MUST contain a AES-IV associated with this OID
   contains the initialization vector IV:

       AES-IV ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE(16))

   Content encryption algorithm identifiers are located in the
   EnvelopedData EncryptedContentInfo contentEncryptionAlgorithm and the
   EncryptedData EncryptedContentInfo contentEncryptionAlgorithm fields.

   Content encryption algorithms are used to encipher the content
   located in the EnvelopedData EncryptedContentInfo encryptedContent
   and the EncryptedData EncryptedContentInfo encryptedContent fields.

4.2  RSAES-OAEP Algorithm Identifiers and Parameters

 Schaad, Housley                8
                   Use of the AES Algorithm in CMS      November 2000


   The RSAES-OAEP key transport algorithm is the RSA encryption scheme
   defined in RFC 2437 [PKCS#1v2.0], where the message to be encrypted
   is the content-encryption key.

   The RSA key is identified in a certificate using the OID
   rsaEncryption.

      pkcs-1  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=

        iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs-1(1) }

      rsaEncryption OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { pkcs-1 1 }

   Note: This is the same algorithm identifier used by RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5.
   This means that the existence of an RSA key in a certificate cannot
   be used to infer that a recipient can decrypt an RSAES-OAEP encrypted
   content-encryption key.

   The algorithm identifier for RSAES-OAEP is:

      id-RSAES-OAEP  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { pkcs-1 7 }


   The AlgorithmIdentifier parameters field MUST be present, and the
   parameters field MUST contain RSAES-OAEP-params.  RSAES-OAEP-params
   have the following syntax:

      RSAES-OAEP-params  ::=  SEQUENCE

         hashFunc [0] AlgorithmIdentifier DEFAULT sha1Identifier,
         maskGenFunc [1] AlgorithmIdentifier DEFAULT mgf1SHA1Identifier,
         pSourceFunc [2] AlgorithmIdentifier DEFAULT
   pSpecifiedEmptyIdentifier  }

      sha1Identifier  ::=  AlgorithmIdentifier

         id-sha1, NULL  }

      mgf1SHA1Identifier  ::=  AlgorithmIdentifier

         id-mgf1, sha1Identifier  }

      pSpecifiedEmptyIdentifier  ::=  AlgorithmIdentifier

         id-pSpecified, OCTET STRING SIZE (0)  }

      id-sha1  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=

         iso(1) identified-organization(3) oiw(14) secsig(3)
         algorithms(2) 26  }

      id-mgf1  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { pkcs-1 8 }

      id-pSpecified  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { pkcs-1 9 }

   The fields of type RSAES-OAEP-params have the following meanings:

   hashFunc identifies the one-way hash function.  Implementations MUST
   support SHA-1 [SHA1].  The SHA-1 algorithm identifier is comprised of
   the id-sha1 object identifier and a parameter of NULL.
 Schaad, Housley                9
                   Use of the AES Algorithm in CMS      November 2000


   Implementations that perform encryption MUST omit the hashFunc field
   when SHA-1 is used, indicating that the default algorithm was used.
   Implementations that perform decryption MUST recognize both the id-
   sha1 object identifier and an absent hashFunc field as an indication
   that SHA-1 was used.

   maskGenFunc identifies the mask generation function. Implementations
   MUST support MFG1 [PKCS#1v2.0].  MFG1 requires a one-way hash
   function, and it is identified in the parameter field of the MFG1
   algorithm identifier.  Implementations MUST support SHA-1 [SHA1].
   The MFG1 algorithm identifier is comprised of the id-mgf1 object
   identifier and a parameter that contains the algorithm identifier of
   the one-way hash function employed with MFG1.  The SHA-1 algorithm
   identifier is comprised of the id-sha1 object identifier and a
   parameter of NULL.  Implementations that perform encryption MUST omit
   the maskGenFunc field when MFG1 with SHA-1 is used, indicating that
   the default algorithm was used.  Implementations that perform
   decryption MUST recognize both the id-mgf1 and id-sha1 object
   identifiers as well as an absent maskGenFunc field as an indication
   that MFG1 with SHA-1 was used.

   pSourceFunc identifies the source (and possibly the value) of the
   encoding parameters, commonly called P.  Implementations MUST
   represent P by an algorithm identifier, id-pSpecified, indicating
   that P is explicitly provided as an OCTET STRING in the parameters.
   The default value for P is an empty string.  In this case, pHash in
   EME-OAEP contains the hash of a zero length string.  Implementations
   MUST support a zero length P value.  Implementations that perform
   encryption MUST omit the pSourceFunc field when a zero length P value
   is used, indicating that the default value was used.  Implementations
   that perform decryption MUST recognize both the id-pSpecified object
   identifier and an absent pSourceFunc field as an indication that a
   zero length P value was used.

5  SMIMECapabilities Attribute Conventions

   An S/MIME client SHOULD announce the set of cryptographic functions
   it supports by using the S/MIME capabilities attribute.  This
   attribute provides a partial list of object identifiers of
   cryptographic functions and MUST be signed by the client. The
   algorithm OIDs SHOULD be logically separated in functional categories
   and MUST be ordered with respect to their preference.

   RFC 2633 [MSG], Section 2.5.2 defines the SMIMECapabilities signed
   attribute (defined as a SEQUENCE of SMIMECapability SEQUENCEs) to be
   used to specify a partial list of algorithms that the software
   announcing the SMIMECapabilities can support.

5.1  RSAES-OEAP SMIMECapability Attribute

   When constructing a signedData object, compliant software MAY include
   the SMIMECapabilities signed attribute announcing that it supports
   the RSAES-OAEP algorithm.

 Schaad, Housley                10
                   Use of the AES Algorithm in CMS      November 2000


   The SMIMECapability SEQUENCE representing RSAES-OAEP MUST include the
   id-RSAES-OAEP object identifier in the capabilityID field and MUST
   include the RSAES-OAEP-Default-Identifier SEQUENCE in the parameters
   field.

      RSAES-OAEP-Default-Identifier  ::=  AlgorithmIdentifier

        id-RSAES-OAEP,

          sha1Identifier, mgf1SHA1Identifier, pSpecifiedEmptyIdentifier
   }  }

   When all of the default settings are selected, the SMIMECapability
   SEQUENCE representing RSAES-OAEP MUST be DER-encoded as:

         30 0D 06 09 2A 86 48 86 F7 0D 01 01 07 30 00

5.2  AES S/MIME Capability Attributes

   If an S/MIME client is required to support symmetric encryption with
   AES, the capabilities attribute MUST contain the AES object
   identifier specified above in the category of symmetric algorithms.
   The parameter associated with this object identifier MUST is
   AESSMimeCapability.

       AESSMimeCapabilty ::= NULL

   The encodings for the mandatory key sizes are:

         Key Size                   Capability
          128          30 0D 06 09 60 86 48 01 65 03 04 01 02 30 00
          196          30 0D 06 09 60 86 48 01 65 03 04 01 16 30 00
          256          30 0D 06 09 60 86 48 01 65 03 04 01 2A 30 00

   When a sending agent creates an encrypted message, it has to decide
   which type of encryption algorithm to use.  In general the decision
   process involves information obtained from the capabilities lists
   included in messages received from the recipient, as well as other
   information such as private agreements, user preferences, legal
   restrictions, and so on.  If users require AES for symmetric
   encryption, the S/MIME clients on both the sending and receiving side
   MUST support it, and it MUST be set in the user preferences.


6  Security Considerations

   If RSA-OAEP and RSA #1 v1.5 are both used to transport the same
   content encryption key, then an attacker can still use the
   Bleichenbacher attack against the RSA #1 v1.5 encrypted key.  It is
   generally unadvisable to mix both RSA-OAEP and RSA #1 v1.5 in the
   same set of recipients.

   Implementations must protect the RSA private key and the content-
   encryption key.  Compromise of the RSA private key may result in the
   disclosure of all messages protected with that key.  Compromise of

   the content-encryption key may result in disclosure of the associated
   encrypted content.

   Implementations must protect the key management private key and the
   message-authentication key.  Compromise of the key management private
   key permits masquerade of authenticated data.  Compromise of the
   message-authentication key may result in undetectable modification of
   the authenticated content.

   The generation of RSA public/private key pairs relies on a random
   numbers.  The use of inadequate pseudo-random number generators
   (PRNGs) to generate cryptographic keys can result in little or no
   security.  An attacker may find it much easier to reproduce the PRNG
   environment that produced the keys, searching the resulting small set
   of possibilities, rather than brute force searching the whole key
   space.  The generation of quality random numbers is difficult.  RFC
   1750 [RANDOM] offers important guidance in this area.

7  Open Issues

   - Key wrap algorithm is undetermined.
   - Mandatory key sizes for Key Wrap
   - Mandatory key sizes for AES algorithm
   - References to each algorithm that would be acceptable to the RFC
   editor.
   - Does the oid for key derivation need to be changed since we are
   using SHA-256 not SHA-1?
