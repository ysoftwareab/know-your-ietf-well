               Guidelines for Defining Packet Timestamps
                  draft-ietf-ntp-packet-timestamps-00

Abstract

   This document specifies guidelines for defining binary packet
   timestamp formats in networking protocols at various layers.  It also
   presents three recommended timestamp formats.  The target audience of
   this memo includes network protocol designers.  It is expected that a
   new network protocol that requires a packet timestamp will, in most
   cases, use one of the recommended timestamp formats.  If none of the
   recommended formats fits the protocol requirements, the new protocol
   specification should specify the format of the packet timestamp
   according to the guidelines in this document.

1.  Introduction

   Timestamps are widely used in network protocols for various purposes,
   including delay measurement, clock synchronization, and logging or
   reporting the time of an event.

   Timestamps are represented in the RFC series in one of two forms:
   text-based timestamps, and packet timestamps.  Text-based timestamps
   [RFC3339] are represented as user-friendly strings, and are widely
   used in the RFC series, for example in information objects and data
   models, e.g., [RFC5646], [RFC6991], and [RFC7493].  Packet
   timestamps, on the other hand, are represented by a compact binary
   field that has a fixed size, and are not intended to have a human-
   friendly format.  Packet timestamps are also very common in the RFC

   series, and are used for example for measuring delay and for
   synchronizing clocks, e.g., [RFC5905], [RFC4656], and [RFC1323].

   This memo presents guidelines for defining a packet timestamp format
   in network protocols.  Three recommended timestamp formats are
   presented.  It is expected that a new network protocol that requires
   a packet timestamp will, in most cases, use one of the recommended
   timestamp formats.  If none of the recommended formats fits the
   protocol requirements, the new protocol specification should specify
   the format of the packet timestamp according to the guidelines in
   this document.

2.  Terminology

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.2.  Abbreviations

   NTP         Network Time Protocol [RFC5905]

   PTP         Precision Time Protocol [IEEE1588]

3.  Packet Timestamp Format Specification

   This memo recommends to use the timestamp formats defined in
   Section 4.  In cases where these timestamp formats do not satisfy the
   protocol requirements, the timestamp specification should clearly
   state the reasons for defining a new format.  Moreover, it is
   recommended to derive the new timestamp format from an existing
   timestamp format, either a timestamp format from this memo, or any
   other previously defined timestamp format.

   This section defines a template for specifying packet timestamp
   formats.  A timestamp format specification MUST include the following
   aspects:

   Timestamp field format:

      The format of the timestamp field consists of:

      + Size: The number of bits (or octets) used to represent the
      packet timestamp field.

      + Units: The units used to represent the timestamp.



Mizrahi, et al.          Expires April 29, 2018                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft              Packet Timestamps               October 2017


      If the timestamp is comprised of more than one field, the format
      of each field is specified.

   Epoch:

      The origin of the timescale used for the timestamp; the moment in
      time used as a reference for the timestamp value.

   Resolution:

      The timestamp resolution; the resolution is equal to the timestamp
      field unit.  If the timestamp consists of two or more fields using
      different time units, then the resolution is the smallest time
      unit.

   Wraparound:

      The wraparound period of the timestamp; any further wraparound-
      related considerations should be described here.

4.  Recommended Timestamp Formats

   This memo recommends to use one of the timestamp formats specified
   below.

   Clearly, different network protocols may have different requirements
   and constraints, and consequently may use different timestamp
   formats.  The choice of the specific timestamp format for a given
   protocol may depend on a various factors.  A few examples of factors
   that may affect the choice of the timestamp format:

   o  Timestamp size: while some network protocols may allow a large
      timestamp fields, in other cases there may be constraints with
      respect to the timestamp size, affecting the choice of the
      timestamp format.

   o  Resolution: the time resolution is another factor that may
      directly affect the selected timestamp format.  Similarly, the
      wraparound periodicity of the timestamp may also affect the
      selected format.

   o  Wraparound period: the length of the time interval in which the
      timestamp is unique may also be an important factor in choosing
      the timestamp format.  Along with the timestamp resolution, these
      two factors determine the required number of bits in the
      timestamp.

Internet-Draft              Packet Timestamps               October 2017


   o  Common format for multiple protocols: if there are two or more
      network protocols that use timestamps and are often used together
      in typical systems, using a common timestamp format should be
      preferred if possible.  Specifically, if the network protocol that
      is being defined typically runs on a PC, then an NTP-based
      timestamp format may allow easier integration with an NTP-
      synchronized timer.  In contrast, a protocol that is typically
      deployed on a hardware-based platform, may make better use of a
      PTP-based timestamp, allowing more efficient integration with a
      PTP-synchronized timer.

4.1.  Using a Recommended Timestamp Format

   A specification that uses one of the recommended timestamp formats
   should specify explicitly that this is a recommended timestamp
   format, and point to the relevant section in the current memo.

   A specification that uses one of the recommended timestamp formats
   should also include a section on Synchronization Aspects.  Any
   assumptions or requirements related to synchronization should be
   specified in this section.  For example, the synchronization aspects
   may specify whether nodes populating the timestamps should be
   synchronized among themselves, and whether the timestamp is measured
   with respect to a central reference clock such as an NTP server.  If
   time is assumed to be synchronized to a time standard such as UTC or
   TAI, it should be specified in this section.  Further considerations
   may be discussed in this section, such as required accuracy, or leap
   second handling.

4.2.  NTP Timestamp Formats

4.2.1.  NTP 64-bit Timestamp Format

   The Network Time Protocol (NTP) 64-bit timestamp format is defined in
   [RFC5905].  This timestamp format is used in several network
   protocols, including [RFC6374], [RFC4656], and [RFC5357].  Since this
   timestamp format is used in NTP, this timestamp format should be
   preferred in network protocols that are typically deployed in concert
   with NTP.

   The format is presented in this section according to the template
   defined in Section 3.

4.2.2.  NTP 32-bit Timestamp Format

   The Network Time Protocol (NTP) 32-bit timestamp format is defined in
   [RFC5905].  This timestamp format is used in
   [I-D.morton-ippm-mbm-registry].  This timestamp format should be
   preferred in network protocols that are typically deployed in concert
   with NTP.  The 32-bit format can be used either when space

   constraints do not allow the use of the 64-bit format, or when the
   32-bit format satisfies the resolution and wraparound requirements.

4.3.  The PTP Truncated Timestamp Format

   The Precision Time Protocol (PTP) [IEEE1588] uses an 80-bit timestamp
   format.  The truncated timestamp format is a 64-bit field, which is
   the 64 least significant bits of the 80-bit PTP timestamp.  Since
   this timestamp format is similar to the one used in PTP, this
   timestamp format should be preferred in network protocols that are
   typically deployed in PTP-capable devices.

   The PTP truncated timestamp format is used in several protocols, such
   as [RFC6374], [RFC7456], [RFC8186] and [ITU-T-Y.1731].

5.  Timestamp Use Cases

   Packet timestamps are used in various network protocols.  Typical
   applications of packet timestamps include delay measurement, clock
   synchronization, and others.  The following table presents a (non-
   exhaustive) list of protocols that use packet timestamps, and the
   timestamp formats used in each of these protocols.

              Figure 4: Protocols that use Packet Timestamps

   The rest of this section presents two hypothetic examples of network
   protocol specifications that use one of the recommended timestamp
   formats.  The examples include the text that specifies the
   information related to the timestamp format.

5.1.  Example 1

   Timestamp:






Mizrahi, et al.          Expires April 29, 2018                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft              Packet Timestamps               October 2017


      The timestamp format used in this specification is the NTP
      [RFC5905] 64-bit format, as specified in Section 4.2.1 of
      [I-D.mizrahi-intarea-packet-timestamps].

   Synchronization aspects:

      It is assumed that nodes that run this protocol are synchronized
      to UTC using a synchronization mechanism that is outside the scope
      of this document.  In typical deployments this protocol will be
      run on a machine that uses NTP [RFC5905] for synchronization.
      Thus, the timestamp may be derived from the NTP-synchronized
      clock, allowing the timestamp to be measured with respect to the
      clock of an NTP server.

5.2.  Example 2

   Timestamp:

      The timestamp format used in this specification is the PTP
      [IEEE1588] Truncated format, as specified in Section 4.2.3 of
      [I-D.mizrahi-intarea-packet-timestamps].

   Synchronization aspects:

      It is assumed that nodes that run this protocol are synchronized
      among themselves.  Nodes may be synchronized to a global reference
      time.  Note that if PTP [IEEE1588] is used for synchronization,
      the timestamp may be derived from the PTP-synchronized clock,
      allowing the timestamp to be measured with respect to the clock of
      an PTP Grandmaster clock.

6.  Packet Timestamp Control Field

   In some cases it is desirable to have a control field that includes
   information about the timestamp format.  This section defines a
   recommended format of a timestamp-related control field that is
   intended for network protocols that require such timestamp-related
   control information.

   The recommended control field includes the following sub-fields:

   o  Timestamp format.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

8.  Security Considerations

   A network protocol that uses a packet timestamp MUST specify the
   security considerations that result from using the timestamp.  This
   section provides an overview of some of the common security
   considerations of using timestamps.

   Any metadata that is attached to control or data packets, and
   specifically packet timestamps, can facilitate network
   reconnaissance; by passively eavesdropping to timestamped packets an
   attacker can gather information about the network performance, and
   about the level of synchronization between nodes.

   Timestamps can be spoofed or modified by on-path attackers, thus
   attacking the application that uses the timestamps.  For example, if
   timestamps are used in a delay measurement protocol, an attacker can
   modify en route timestamps in a way that manipulates the measurement
   results.  Integrity protection mechanisms, such as Hashed Message
   Authentication Codes (HMAC), can mitigate such attacks.  The
   specification of an integrity protection mechanism is outside the
   scope of this document, as typically integrity protection will be
   defined on a per-network-protocol basis, and not specifically for the
   timestamp field.

   Another potential threat that can have a similar impact is delay
   attacks.  An attacker can maliciously delay some or all of the en
   route messages, with the same harmful implications as described in
   the previous paragraph.  Mitigating delay attacks is a significant
   challenge; in contrast to spoofing and modification attacks, the
   delay attack cannot be prevented by cryptographic integrity
   protection mechanisms.  In some cases delay attacks can be mitigated
   by sending the timestamped information through multiple paths,
   allowing to detect and to be resilient to an attacker that has access
   to one of the paths.

   In many cases timestamping relies on an underlying synchronization
   mechanism.  Thus, any attack that compromises the synchronization
   mechanism can also compromise protocols that use timestamping.
   Attacks on time protocols are discussed in detail in [RFC7384].
