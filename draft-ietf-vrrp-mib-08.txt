Abstract

   This specification defines an extension to the Management Information
   Base (MIB) for use with SNMP-based network management.  In
   particular, it defines objects for configuring, monitoring, and
   controlling routers that employ the Virtual Router Redundancy
   Protocol (VRRP) [17].

   This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant with
   both the SNMPv2 SMI [19], and semantically identical to the SNMPv1
   definitions [2].

INTERNET-DRAFT         VRRP MIB Management Objects         June 24, 1999


1.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

    o Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
      purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in RFC
      1155 [2], RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The second version,
      called SMIv2, is described in RFC 2578 [5], RFC 2579 [6] and RFC
      2580 [7].

    o Message protocols for transferring management information. The
      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
      described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message
      protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is
      called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
      The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and
      described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574 [12].

    o Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
      first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
      described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol operations and
      associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

    o A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and
      the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
      [15].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [16].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

2.  Overview

   This memo identifies the set of objects for configuring, monitoring,
   and controlling the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), as
   defined in RFC 2338 [17].

   VRRP specifies an election protocol that will allow one or more
   associated IP addresses to be assumed by another router in the event
   of a failure of the IP address(es) owner. Thus, IP traffic from a
   host using a failed router as a default gateway is transparently
   fowarded by the VRRP router that has assumed control.  VRRP provides
   redundancy in routed networks without requiring configuration of
   dynamic routing or router discovery protocols on every end-host.


2.1.  VRRP MIB Structure

   The VRRP MIB contains three conformance groups:

    - vrrpOperations Group: Objects related to VRRP router's
      configuration and control.

    - vrrpStatistics Group: Objects containing information useful in
      monitoring the operation of VRRP routers.

    - vrrpNotifications Group: Consists of objects and definitions for
      use in SNMP traps sent by VRRP routers.

   Tables in the MIB include the following:

    (1) The vrrpOperTable, which contains objects that define the
        operational characteristics of a VRRP router. Rows in this table
        correspond to instances of virtual routers.

    (2) The vrrpAssoIpAddrTable, which contains the addresses of the
        virtual router(s) that a given VRRP router is backing up.

    (3) The vrrpRouterStatsTable which contains the operating statistics
        for a VRRP router.

2.2.  Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol

   This MIB is based on the following characteristics of VRRP as defined
   in the VRRP specification [17].

    - A "VRRP router" is one that is configured to run the VRRP protocol
      in conjunction with one or more other VRRP routers attached to a
      LAN.



draft-ietf-vrrp-mib-08.txt                                      [Page 4]


INTERNET-DRAFT         VRRP MIB Management Objects         June 24, 1999


    - A VRRP router can be running one or more instances of a virtual
      router.

    - A "virtual router" is an abstraction which consists of two or more
      physical routers associated by a Virtual Router Identifier (VRID).

    - An instance of a virtual router (on a physical VRRP router), can
      be uniquely identified by a combination of the 'IF Index' [18] and
      "Virtual Router Identifier" (VRID).

    - For each VRID there is a set of one or more "associated IP
      addresses" that are backed-up by the virtual router.


2.3.  VRRP MIB Table Design

   The tables in the VRRP MIB are structured with the assumption that a
   VRRP network management application would likely be designed to
   display information or provide configuration about a VRRP router on a
   "per-virtual-router basis". Thus, the tables defined in the MIB
   consist of conceptual rows which are grouped in a manner to present a
   view of individual virtual routers with a minimal number of SNMP
   operations.


2.3.1.  Relation to Interface Group (RFC 2233) [23].

   Since a router can be participating in VRRP on one or more physical
   interfaces, "ifIndex" is used as an index into the tables defined in
   the VRRP MIB.


2.4.  VRRP Scenarios

   The following section provides examples of how some of the objects in
   this MIB are instantiated for two different VRRP scenarios.

   KEY:
   ----

   The labels in the following tables and diagrams correspond to the
   actual MIB objects as follows:

      if      = vrrpOperIfIndex
      VrId    = vrrpOperVrId
      State   = vrrpOperState
      Prior   = vrrpOperPriority
      AddrCnt = vrrpOperIpAddrCount

      RowStat = vrrpOperRowStatus


2.4.1.  VRRP Scenario #1

   The following figure shows a simple network with two VRRP routers
   configured with two virtual routers. This sample topology is taken
   from the VRRP specification [17]. Addresses in '()' indicate the IP
   address of the default gateway for a given host, H1 - H4. In the
   diagram, "Interface" is used in the context defined in MIB-II [4].

   NOTES:

    1)  "I1" and "I2" are used to designate IF indices on each
        respective router.

    2)  For "State": M = Master; B = Backup.

    3)  In the vrrpOperTable, a "priority" of 255 indicates that the
        respective router owns the IP address, e.g., this IP address is
        native to the router (i.e., "the IP Address Owner" [17]).


2.4.2.  VRRP Scenario #2

   The following figure shows a simple network with two virtual routers.
   Here, a single interface has been configured with two IP addresses.
   Again, addresses in () indicate the IP address of the default gateway
   for a given host, H1 - H2.

            be transitioned to `initialize'.

            The rowstatus column has six defined values:

              - `active' (read/set). When this value is read, it
                indicates that all the read-create objects (in the row)
                required for virtual router operation have been
                correctly initialized such that the respective virtual
                router can be made operational by setting the
                `vrrpOperAdminState' to `up'. When set to `active',
                no other objects in the conceptual row, with the
                exception of `vrrpOperAdminState', can be modified.

                When set, the agent will transition the value of
                rowstatus to `notReady' if the row is incomplete.

              - `notInService' (read/set), which when set, allows the
                objects in the row to be modified by a management station,
                thus changing the operational characteristics of the
                corresponding virtual router.

              - `notReady' (read). The agent sets the object to this
                state to indicate that the conceptual row exists,
                but is lacking initialization of one or more objects
                required for virtual router operation.

              - `createAndGo' (set), which is set by a management

                station wishing to create a new instance of a
                virtual router and to have its status automatically
                set to `active', making it available for use by a
                virtual  router. Upon receiving a request to set the
                rowstatus to this value, the agent transitions the
                rowstatus to `active' if the other settable objects
                in the row have been correctly initialized. If the
                row is incomplete, the agent transitions the state to
                `notReady'.

              - `createAndWait' (set), which is set by a management
                station wishing to create a new instance of a
                virtual router but not make it available for use.
                When this value is set, rowstatus transitions to
                `notInService' if the row has been correctly
                initialized; if the row is incomplete, rowstatus will
                become `notReady'.

              - `destroy' (set), which deletes the conceptual row,
                and hence, the corresponding instance of a virtual
                router."

INTERNET-DRAFT         VRRP MIB Management Objects         June 24, 1999


4.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write or read-create. Such objects
   may be considered sensitive or vulnerable to security attacks in some
   networking environments. The support for SET operations in a non-
   secure environment without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on VRRP router operations.

   A number of objects in the vrrpOperTable possess the read-create
   attribute. Manipulation of these objects is capable of affecting the
   operation of a virtual router.

   Specific examples of this include, but are not limited to:

    o The vrrpOperAdminState object which could be used to disable a
      virtual router.

    o The vrrpOperPrimaryIpAddr object which, if compromised, could
      allow assignment of an invalid IP address to a master router.

    o The authentication type/key related objects which could
      potentially render the VRRP security mechanisms ineffective.

   Of additional concern is the ability to disable the transmission of
   traps. This would nullify the capability of a virtual router to
   provide notification in the event of an authentication failure.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-
   based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.

   -- -------------------------------------------------------------------
   --                          Change Log
   -- -------------------------------------------------------------------
   This section tracks changes made during revisions of this document. It
   will be deleted when the document is published as an RFC.

   * June 1999: Changes in 8th revision (draft-ietf-vrrp-mib-08.txt):

     - Changed inport of "ifIndex" from RFC 1213 to IF-MIB.
     - Added new IANA assigned MIB OID (68).


   * June 1999: Changes in 7th revision (draft-ietf-vrrp-mib-07.txt):

     - Added MIB Boilerplate for "The SNMP Management Framework" section.
     - Added "Security Considerations" section
     - Removed references to "SNMPv2" in header and footers.


   * May, 1999: Changes in 6th revision (draft-ietf-vrrp-mib-06.txt):

     - Removed description of how "vrrpOperVirtualMacAddr" is specifed
       as per changes to the VRRP Spec (addition of Token Ring).
     - Added citiations for RFC 1903 and RFC 1904 in references.
     - Modifed reference to RFC 1573, which has been obsoleted by RFC
       2233.


   * March, 1999: Changes in 5th revision (draft-ietf-vrrp-mib-05.txt):

     - Objects under "vrrpRouterStatsEntry" were renumbered. OID's
       became out-of-sequence due to changes made in the last revision
       (04).
     - Format of section numbers was changed ('.' added) to be consistant
       with other RFC's.
     - Changed the type of "vrrpNodeVersion" from INTEGER to Integer32.
       Also made DEFVAL (for this object) a decimal number.
     - A few spelling and typographical corrections were made.
     - Revisions were made to the format of some of the references to
       make then more concise and consistant.
     - Reworded the Overview section to attempt to make the description
       of VRRP more in-line with the VRRP RFC.


   * January, 1999: Changes in 4th revision (draft-ietf-vrrp-mib-04.txt):

     - "vrrpNodeVersion" SYNTAX changed from OCTET STRING to INTEGER.
     - Removed the REFERENCE clause from "vrrpOperVirtualMacAddr", as it



draft-ietf-vrrp-mib-08.txt                                     [Page 35]


INTERNET-DRAFT         VRRP MIB Management Objects         June 24, 1999


       was deemed redundant.
     - The range of vrrpOperAddrCount was changed from (1..255) to
       (0..255). This reflects the fact that a row might be created
       in the vrrpOperTable *prior* to creating a row in the
       vrrpAssoIpAddrTable.
     - Removed DEFVAL clause from "vrrpOperAuthKey" as unnecessary.
     - Moved the following objects out of the "vrrpRouterStatsTable"
       to become "global" VRRP router objects: "vrrpStatsChecksunErrors",
       "vrrpStatsVersionErrors", "vrrpStatsVrIdErrors". Each of these
       was renamed "vrrpRouter*", accordingly (since they are no longer
       members of the vrrpRouterStatsTable. The reason for this change
       is that, when any of these events occur, attempting to map the
       packet, with possible corruption of the VRID (or other fields),
       into a row of the vrrpRouterStatsTable would be risky, at best.
     - Removed "vrrpOperVirtualMacAddr" from the "vrrpTrapNewMaster".
       Since the virtual MAC can be derived from the VR ID, this was
       extra payload in the trap.
     - removed "vrrpTrapConfigErrorType" and "vrrpTrapPacketSrc"
       from conformance groups, as these are not mandatory objects.
     - Added new object, "vrrpOperPrimaryIpAddr" to vrrpOperTable.
       This object allows for designation of the vrrp IP primary
       address on an interface with multiple IP addresses, should this
       virtual router transition from backup to master.
     - Changed vrrpRouterStatsEntry to AUGMENT the vrrpOperEntry, since
       there is a one-to-one correspondence between these two objects
       and they are indexed with identical parmeters.
     - Addded new object, vrrpStatsPacketLengthErrors, to the statistics
       table.
     - Changed the description for "vrrpStatsSecurityViolations" to apply
       to *all* types of authentication failures, as opposed to
       cleartext auth failures only, which it previously stated.
     - Renamed "vrrpTrapConfigErrorType" object to "vrrpTrapAuthErrorType"
       and added a new enumeration for "authentication failures".
     - Renamed "vrrpStatsAuthTypeErrors" to "vrrpStatsAuthTypeMismatch".
     - Renamed "vrrpStatsSecurityViolations" to " vrrpStats-
       AuthenticationFailures"


   * November, 1998: Changes in 3rd revision (draft-ietf-vrrp-mib-03.txt):

     - Changed name of "vrrpAssoIpAddrStatus" object to
       "vrrpAssoIpAddrRowStatus" for consistancy with similar object
       in vrrpOperTable.
     - Changed name of "vrrpOperControl" object to "vrrpOperAdminState"
       and enhanced description clause.
     - Renumbered the objects in both the vrrpOperTable and
       vrrpAssoIpAddrTable. The first objects in the tables started
       with an OID of '2', when they should have started with '1'.



draft-ietf-vrrp-mib-08.txt                                     [Page 36]


INTERNET-DRAFT         VRRP MIB Management Objects         June 24, 1999


     - Changed the name of "vrrpStatsUnknownAuthType" to
       "vrrpStatsInvalidAuthType" as per suggestion that it was
       more concise.
     - Rewrote the descriptions for the table Entry objects and the
       rowstatus objects to make the process of row creation and
       deletion more clear. Each enumeration of the rowstatus
       object in the "vrrpOperTable" is now clearly explained.
     - Changed MAX-ACCESS to "read-create" on the "vrrpOperAuthType"
       and "vrrpOperAuthKey" objects. This was done with the
       assumption the the VRRP RFC will change to make these
       attributes defined on a "per-virtual-router-basis" as
       was proposed at the August (1998) IETF Meeting.


   * July, 1998: Changes in 2nd revision (draft-ietf-vrrp-mib-02.txt):

     - A number of changes were made to the textual content of the
       draft as per feedback received at the last WG meeting. These
       changes were too numerous to document individually in this
       section.
     - The size of the "vrrpNodeVersion" object has been changed from
       2 octets to 1 octet.
     - References to obsoleted RFC's have been replaced by references
       to later documents. Notably, references to RFC's 1442, 1443 and
       1444 have been replaced by RFC 1902, RFC 1903 and RFC 1904,
       respectively.
     - The description for the "vrrpOperControl" was changed to
       reflect the fact that a virtual router does not necessarily
       transition directly from initialize state -> backup state.
       The description for the "vrrpStatsBecomeMaster" was also
       changed to more accurately convey this fact.
     - The SYNTAX of the "vrrpOperIpAddrCount" was changed to
       reflect the fact that a virtual router can support only up
       to 255 backup IP addresses.
     - Descriptions for vrrpOperAuthType and vrrpOperAuthKey expanded
       to indicate the per-interface assignment.
     - SYNTAX of vrrpOperPreemptMode object changed from INTEGER
       to 'truthValue'
     - The OIDs for the VRRP traps were fixed; incorrect ident-
       ifiers ('vrrpOperations') had been used in OID assignments.
     - The SYNTAX for the 'vrrpOperPriority' object was corrected
       to indicate that this can have a value of '0'.
     - The vrrpOperHMACMD5Key object was deleted. It was combined
       with the vrrpOperAuthKey object, whose SYNTAX was adjusted
       accordingly.
     - OID for 'vrrpTraps' changed to '{ vrrpNotifications 1 }'
     - The 'vrrpStatsPasswdSecurityViolations' and 'vrrpStatsHmac-
       SecurityViolations' objects have been combined into a



draft-ietf-vrrp-mib-08.txt                                     [Page 37]


INTERNET-DRAFT         VRRP MIB Management Objects         June 24, 1999


       single 'vrrpStatsSecurityViolations' object; this was
       suggested to avoid redundancy.
     - As per the last WG meeting, the 'vrrpAssoIpAddrIndex' object
       has been deleted from the 'vrrpAssoIpAddrTable'and replaced
       by 'vrrpAssoIpAddr'.
     - Removed references to 'vrrpAssoIpAddrIndex' in samples.
     - Added new object 'vrrpOperProtocol' to 'VrrpOperEntry'.
     - MAX-ACCESS for the 'vrrpOperVrId' object changed to
       'not-accessible', as per RFC1902 (auxilary objects).
     - SYNTAX for 'vrrpOperVirtualRouterUpTime' changed to
       'TimeStamp'.
     - Added importation of 'TruthValue'and 'TimeStamp' to accomodate
       changes listed above. Deleted importation of 'TimeTicks'.
     - Changed MAX-ACCESS to 'accessible-for-notify' for
       'vrrpTrapPacketSrc' and 'vrrpTrapConfigErrorType' objects.
     - In the sample tables, the "if" values were incorrect for
       the sample tables for "IP B" (they used to read "I1").
     - MAX-ACCESS for 'vrrpOperAuthType' and 'vrrpOperAuthKey'
       changed to 'read-only', since these objects are defined on
       a per-interface basis.
     - Overall review and editing of Section 5.0 (References) with
       deletion of references not used in this document. Also, added
       reference '9'.

     Concerns:
     ---------
     - Keep the 'vrrpTrapAuthFailure' trap?
     - Remove 'vrrpTrapPacketSrc' and 'vrrpTrapConfigErrorType' from
       compliances? Only used for 'vrrpTrapAuthFailure' trap.


   * 3/4/1998: Changes in 1st revision (draft-ietf-vrrp-mib-01.txt):

     - Overall review and editing of document text and object
       descriptions from feedback received at December 1997 IETF meeting.
       More specifically the changes made along these lines include
       the following:

       -- Cleaned up Section 5.0 ("References") and validated.
       -- Modifed diagram for VRRP Scenario #2 (Section 2.4.2).
       -- VRRP Overview (Section 2.0) rewritten to be more in-line with
          latest revision (05) of VRRP RFC Draft.
       -- Description of "VrId" Textual convention rewritten.

     - MAX-ACCESS of vrrpTrapCntl object changed to "read-write".
     - Changed SYNTAX of "vrrpOperVirtualMacAddr" object from
       "PhyAddress" to "MacAddress".
     - Changed the syntax of the "vrrpOperPriority" object so upper

INTERNET-DRAFT         VRRP MIB Management Objects         June 24, 1999


       value can be 255.
     - Change MAX-ACCESS for "vrrpOperAuthType" object from
       read-only to read-create.
     - Added three new objects to "vrrpRouterStatsTable":
       "vrrpStatsAddressListErrors", "vrrpStatsUnknownAuthType"
       and "vrrpStatsAuthTypeErrors".
     - Removed "vrrpStatsUnknownPacketType" object, as it was
       redundant (with "vrrpStatsInvalidPacketType").
     - Removed the "vrrpOperIfIndex" object to use "ifIndex" (which is
       actually equivalent) instead.


   * 11/19/97 (vft-ietf-vrrp-mib-00.txt) - Initial Draft
