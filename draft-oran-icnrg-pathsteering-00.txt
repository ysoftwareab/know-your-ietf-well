Abstract

   Path Steering is a mechanism to discover paths to the producers of
   ICN content objects and steer subsequent Interest messages along a
   previously discovered path.  It has various uses, including the
   operation of state-of-the-art multipath congestion control algorithms
   and for network measurement and management.  This specification
   derives directly from the design published in _Path Switching in
   Content Centric and Named Data Networks_ (4th ACM Conference on
   Information-Centric Networking - ICN'17) and therefore does not
   recapitulate the design motivations, implementation details, or
   evaluation of the scheme.  Some technical details are different
   however, and where there are differences, the design documented here
   is to be considered definitive.

1.  Introduction

   Path Steering is a mechanism to discover paths to the producers of
   ICN content objects and steer subsequent Interest messages along a
   previously discovered path.  It has various uses, including the
   operation of state-of-the-art multipath congestion control algorithms
   and for network measurement and management.  This specification
   derives directly from the design published in [Moiseenko2017] and
   therefore does not recapitulate the design motivations,
   implementation details, or evaluation of the scheme.  That
   publication should be considered a normative reference as it is not
   likely a reader will be able to understand all elements of this
   design without first having read the reference.  Some technical
   details are different however, and where there are differences, the
   design documented here is to be considered definitive.

Internet-Draft              ICN Path Steering               October 2019


   There are a number of important use cases to justify extending ICN
   architectures such as CCNx [RFC8569] or NDN [NDN] to provide these
   capabilities.  These are summarized as follows:

   o  Support the discovery, monitoring and troubleshooting of multi-
      path network connectivity based on names and name prefixes.
      Analogous functions have been shown to be a crucial operational
      capability in multicast and multi-path topologies for IP.  The
      canonical tools are the well-known _traceroute_ and _ping_. For
      point-to-multipoint MPLS the more recent tree trace [RFC8029]
      protocol is used.  Equivalent diagnostic functions have been
      defined for CCNx through the ICN Ping
      [I-D.mastorakis-icnrg-icnping] and ICN Traceroute
      [I-D.mastorakis-icnrg-icntraceroute] specifications, both of which
      are capable of exploiting path steering if available.

   o  Perform accurate online measurement of network performance, which
      generally requires multiple consecutive packets follow the same
      path under control of an application.

   o  Improve the performance and flexibility of multi-path congestion
      control algorithms.  Congestion control schemes such as
      [Mahdian2016] and [Song2018] depend on the ability of a consumer
      to explicitly steer packets onto individual paths in a multi-path
      and/or multi-destination topology.

   o  A consumer endpoint can mitigate content poisoning attacks by
      directing its Interests onto the network paths that bypass
      poisoned caches.

   Path discovery and subsequent path steering in ICN networks is
   facilitated by the symmetry of forward and reverse paths in the CCNx
   and NDN architectures.  Path discovery is achieved by a consumer
   endpoint transmitting an ordinary Interest message and receiving a
   Content (Data) message containing an end-to-end path label
   constructed on the reverse path by the forwarding plane.  Path
   steering is achieved by a consumer endpoint including a path label in
   the Interest message, which is forwarded to each nexthop through the
   corresponding egress interfaces in conjunction with longest name
   prefix match (LNPM) FIB lookup.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Essential elements of ICN path discovery and path steering

   We elucidate the design using CCNx semantics [RFC8569] and extend its
   Packet Encoding [RFC8609] as defined in Section 3.2.  While the
   terminology is slightly different, this design can be applied also to
   NDN, by extending its bespoke packet encodings [NDNTLV] (See
   Section 3.3).

2.1.  Path Discovery

   _End-to-end Path Discovery_ for CCNx is achieved by creating a _path
   label_ and placing it as a hop-by-hop TLV in a CCNx Content (Data)
   message.  The path label is constructed hop-by-hop as the message
   traverses the reverse path of transit CCNx forwarders (Figure 1).
   The path label is updated by adding to the existing path label the
   nexthop label of the interface at which the Content (Data) message
   has arrived.  Eventually, when the Content(Data) message arrives at
   the consumer, the path label identifies the complete path the Content
   (Data) message took to reach the consumer.

2.2.  Path Steering

   Due to the symmetry of forward and reverse paths in CCNx, a consumer
   application can reuse a discovered path label to fetch the same or
   similar (e.g. next chunk, or next Application Data Unit, or next
   pointer in a Manifest [I-D.icnrg-flic]) Content (Data) message over
   the discovered network path.  This _Path Steering_ is achieved by
   processing the Interest message's path label at each transit ICN
   forwarder and forwarding the Interest through the specified nexthop
   among those identified as feasible by LNPM FIB lookup (Figure 2).

2.3.  Handling Path Steering errors

   Over time, the state of interfaces and the FIB on forwarders may
   change such that, at any particular forwarder, a given nexthop is no
   longer valid for a given prefix.  In this case, the path label will
   point to a now-invalid nexthop.  This is detected by failure to find
   a match between the decoded nexthop ID and the nexthops of the FIB
   entry after LNPM FIB lookup.

   On detecting an invalid path label, the forwarder SHOULD respond to
   the Interest with an Interest-Return.  We therefore define a new

Internet-Draft              ICN Path Steering               October 2019


   _Invalid path label_ response code for the Interest Return message
   and include the current path label as a hop-by-hop header.  Each
   transit forwarder processing the Interest-Return message updates the
   path label in the same manner as Content (Data) messages, so that the
   consumer receiving the Interest-Return (NACK) can easily identify
   which path label is no longer valid.

   A consumer may alternatively request that a forwarder detecting the
   inconsistency forward the Interest by means of normal LNPM FIB lookup
   rather than returning an error.  The consumer endpoint, if it cares,
   can keep enough information about outstanding Interests to determine
   if the path label sent with the Interest fails to match the path
   label in the corresponding returned Content (Data), and use that
   information to replace stale path labels.  It does so by setting the
   FALLBACK MODE flag of the path label TLV in its Interest message.

2.4.  How to represent the Path Label

   [Moiseenko2017] presents various options for how to represent a path
   label, with different tradeoffs in flexibility, performance and space
   efficiency.  For this specification, we choose the _Polynomial
   encoding_ which achieves reasonable space efficiency at the cost of
   establishing a hard limit on the length of paths that can be
   represented.

   The polynomial encoding utilizes a fixed-size bit array.  Each
   transit ICN forwarder is allocated a fixed sized portion of the bit
   array.  This design allocates 12 bits (i.e. 4095 as a _generator
   polynomial_) to each intermediate ICN forwarder.  This should match
   the scalability of today's commercial routers that support up to 4096
   physical and logical interfaces and usually do not have more than a
   few hundred active ones.

                      Figure 3: Fixed size path label

   A forwarder that receives a Content (Data) message encodes the
   nexthop label in the next available slot and increments label index.
   Conversely, a forwarder that receives an Interest message reads the
   current nexthop label and decrements label index.  Therefore, the
   extra computation required at each hop to forward either an interest
   or Content Object message with a path label is minimized and

Internet-Draft              ICN Path Steering               October 2019


   constitutes a fairly trivial additional overhead compared to FIB
   lookup and other required operations.

   This approach results in individual path label TLV instances being of
   fixed pre-computed size.  While this places a hard upper bound on the
   maximum number of network hops that can be represented, this is not a
   significant a practical problem in NDN and CCNx, since the size can
   be pre-set during Content(Data) message encoding based on the exact
   number of network hops traversed by the Interest message.  Even long
   paths of 24 hops will fit in a path label bitmap of 36 bytes if
   nexthop label is encoded in 12 bits.

3.  Mapping to CCNx and NDN packet encodings

3.1.  Path label TLV

   A Path label TLV is the tuple: {[Flags], [Path Label Hop Count],
   [Nexthop Label], [Path label bitmap]}.

                     +----------------+-------------+
                     |      Flag      | Value (hex) |
                     +----------------+-------------+
                     | DISCOVERY MODE |     0x00    |
                     | FALLBACK MODE  |     0x01    |
                     |  STRICT MODE   |     0x02    |
                     +----------------+-------------+

                         Table 1: Path label flags

   The Path Label Hop Count (PLHC) MUST be incremented by NDN and CCNx
   forwarders if the Interest packet carries a path label and DISCOVERY
   mode flag is set.  A producer node or a forwarder with cached data
   packet MUST use PLHC in calculation of a path label bitmap size
   suitable for encoding the entire path to the consumer.  The Path
   Label Hop Count (PLHC) MUST be set to zero in newly created Data or
   Interest-Return (NACK) packets.  A consumer node MUST reuse Path
   Label Hop Count (PLHC) together with the Path label bitmap (PLB) in
   order to correctly forward the Interest(s) along the corresponding
   network path.

   If an NDN or CCNx forwarder supports path labeling, the Nexthop label
   MUST be used to determine the correct egress interface for an
   Interest packet carrying either the FALLBACK MODE or STRICT MODE
   flag.  If any particular NDN or CCNx forwarder is configured to
   decrypt path labels of Interest packets (Section "Security
   considerations" (Section 5)), then the forwarder MUST

   1.  decrypt the path label with its own symmetric key,



I. Moiseenko & D. Oran   Expires April 22, 2020                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft              ICN Path Steering               October 2019


   2.  update the nexthop label with outermost label in the path label,

   3.  decrement Path Label Hop Count (PLHC), and

   4.  remove the outermost label from the path label.

   If any particular NDN or CCNx forwarder is NOT configured to decrypt
   path labels of Interest packets, then path label decryption SHOULD
   NOT be performed.

   The Nexthop label MUST be ignored by NDN and CCNx forwarders if
   present in Data or Interest-Return (NACK) packets.  If any particular
   NDN or CCNx forwarder is configured to encrypt path labels of Data
   and Interest-Return (NACK) packets (Section Security Considerations
   (Section 5)), then the forwarder MUST encrypt existing path label
   with its own symmetric key, append the nexthop label of the ingress
   interface to the path label, and increment Path Label Hop Count
   (PLHC).  If any particular NDN or CCNx forwarder is NOT configured to
   encrypt path labels of Interest packets, then path label encryption
   SHOULD NOT be performed.

   NDN and CCNx forwarders MUST fallback to longest name prefix match
   (LNPM) FIB lookup if an Interest packet carries an invalid nexthop
   label and the FALLBACK MODE flag is set.

   CCNx forwarders MUST respond with an Interest Return packet

   carries an invalid path label and the STRICT MODE flag is set.

   CCNx forwarders MUST respond with an Interest Return packet
   specifying the T_RETURN_MALFORMED_INTEREST code if the Interest
   packet carries a path label TLV with both FALLBACK MODE and STRICT
   MODE flags set.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to make the following assignments:

   1.  Please assign the value 0x0004 for T_PATH_LABEL in the *CCNx Hop-
       by-Hop Types* registry.

   2.  Please assign the TLV types in Table 2 in the *CCNx Hop-by-Hop
       type registry*.

   3.  Please assign the value 0xA for the T_RETURN_INVALID_PATH_LABEL
       in the *CCNx Interest Return Code Types" registry*.

   4.  Please create the *CCNx Path Label Flags* registry and assign the
       values listed in Table 1.

5.  Security Considerations

   A path is invalidated by renumbering nexthop label(s).  A malicious
   consumer can attempt to mount an attack by transmitting Interests
   with path labels which differ only in a single now-invalid nexthop
   label in order to _brute force_ a valid nexthop label.  If such an
   attack succeeds, a malicious consumer would be capable of steering
   Interests over a network path that may not match the paths computed
   by the routing algorithm or learned adaptively by the forwarders.

   When a label lookup fails, by default an _Invalid path label_
   Interest-Return (NACK) message is returned to the consumer.  This
   contains a path label identical to the one included in the
   corresponding Interest message.  A malicious consumer can therefore
   analyze the message's Hop Count field to infer which specific nexthop
   label had failed and direct an attack to influence path steering at
   that hop.  This threat can be mitigated by the following
   countermeasures:

Internet-Draft              ICN Path Steering               October 2019


   o  A nexthop label of larger size is harder to crack.  If nexthop
      labels are not allocated in a predictable fashion by the routers,
      brute forcing a 32-bit nexthop label requires on average O(2^31)
      Interests.  However, this specification uses nexthop labels with
      much less entropy (12 bits), so depending on computational
      hardness is not workable.

   o  An ICN forwarder can periodically update nexthop labels to limit
      the maximum lifetime of paths.  It is RECOMMENDED that forwarders
      update path labels at least every few minutes.

   o  A void Hop Count field in an _Invalid path label_ Interest-Return
      (NACK) message would not give out the information on which
      specific nexthop label had failed.  An attacker might need to
      brute force all nexthop labels in all combinations.  However, some
      useful diagnostic capability is lost by obscuring the hop count.
      For example the locus of routing churn is harder to pin down
      through analysis of path-steered pings or traceroutes.  A
      forwarder MAY choose to invalidate the hop count in addition to
      changing nexthop labels periodically as above.

   ICN protocols can be susceptible to a variety of cache poisoning
   attacks, where a colluding consumer and producer arrange for bogus
   content (with either invalid or inappropriate signatures) to populate
   forwarder caches.  These are generally confined to on-path attacks.
   It is also theoretically possible to launch a similar attack without
   a cooperating producer such that the caches of on-path routers become
   poisoned with the content from off-path routers (i.e. physical
   connectivity, but no route in a FIB for a given prefix).  We estimate
   that without any prior knowledge of the network topology, the
   complexity of this type of attack is in the ballpark of Breadth-
   First-Search and Depth-First-Search algorithms with the additional
   burden of transmitting 2^31 Interests in order to crack a nexthop
   label on each hop.  Relatively short periodic update of nexthop
   labels and anti- _label scan_ heuristics implemented in the ICN
   forwarder may successfully mitigate this type of attack.

5.1.  Cryptographic protection of a path label

   If the countermeasures listed above do not provide sufficient
   protection against malicious mis-steering of Interests, the path
   label can be made opaque to the consumer endpoint via hop-by-hop
   symmetric cryptography applied to the path labels (Figure 6).  This
   method is viable due to the symmetry of forward and reverse paths in
   CCNx and NDN architectures combined with ICN path steering requiring
   only reads/writes of the topmost nexthop label (i.e. active nexthop
   label) in the path label.  This way a path steering capable ICN
   forwarder receiving a Data (Content) message encrypts the current

Internet-Draft              ICN Path Steering               October 2019


   path label with its own non-shared symmetric key prior to adding a
   new nexthop label to the path label.  The Data (Content) message is
   forwarded downstream with unencrypted topmost (i.e active) nexthop
   label and encrypted remaining content of the path label.  As a
   result, a consumer endpoint receives a Data (Content) message with a
   unique path label exposing only the topmost nexthop label as
   cleartext.  A path steering forwarder receiving an Interest message
   performs label lookup using the topmost nexthop label, decrypts the
   path label with its own non-shared symmetric key, and forwards the
   message upstream.

   Cryptographic protection of a path label does not require any key
   negotiation among ICN forwarders, and is no more expensive than
   MACsec or IPsec.  It is also quite possible that strict hop-by-hop
   path label encryption is not necessary and path label encryption only
   on the border routers of the trusted administrative or routing
   domains may suffice.
