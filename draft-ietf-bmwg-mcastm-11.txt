  Abstract 
   
     The purpose of this document is to describe methodology specific to 
     the benchmarking of multicast IP forwarding devices. It builds upon 
     the tenets set forth in RFC 2544, RFC 2432 and other IETF 
     Benchmarking Methodology Working Group (BMWG) efforts.  This 
     document seeks to extend these efforts to the multicast paradigm. 
      
     The BMWG produces two major classes of documents: Benchmarking 
     Terminology documents and Benchmarking Methodology documents. The 
     Terminology documents present the benchmarks and other related 
     terms. The Methodology documents define the procedures required to 
     collect the benchmarks cited in the corresponding Terminology 
     documents.

  1. Introduction 
   
     This document defines tests for measuring and reporting the 
     forwarding, latency and IGMP group membership characteristics of 
     devices that support IP multicast routing protocols.  The results 
     of these tests will provide the user with meaningful data on 
     multicast performance. 
      
     A previous document, " Terminology for IP Multicast Benchmarking" 
     (RFC 2432), defined many of the terms that are used in this 
     document. The terminology document should be consulted before 
     attempting to make use of this document. 
      
     This methodology will focus on one source to many destinations, 
     although many of the tests described may be extended to use 
     multiple source to multiple destination topologies. 
   
   
  2. Key Words to Reflect Requirements 
   
     The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",  "SHALL 
     NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" 
     in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.  
     RFC 2119 defines the use of these key words to help make the intent 
     of standards track documents as clear as possible.  While this 
     document uses these keywords, this document is not a standards 
     track document. 
   
   
  3. Test set up 
   
     The set of methodologies presented in this document are for single 
     ingress, multiple egress scenarios as exemplified by Figures 1 and 
     2.  Methodologies for multiple ingress and multiple egress 
     scenarios are beyond the scope of this document. 
      
     Figure 1 shows a typical setup for an IP multicast test, with one 
     source to multiple destinations.

     If the multicast metrics are to be taken across multiple devices 
     forming a System Under Test (SUT), then test frames are offered to 
     a single ingress interface on a device of the SUT, subsequently 
     forwarded across the SUT topology, and finally forwarded to the 
     test apparatus' frame-receiving components by the test egress 
     interface(s) of devices in the SUT. Figure 2 offers an example SUT 
     test topology.  If a SUT is tested, the test topology and all 
     relevant configuration details MUST be disclosed with the 
     corresponding test results.

     Generally, the destination test ports first join the desired number 
     of multicast groups by sending IGMP Group Report messages to the 
     DUT/SUT. To verify that all destination test ports successfully 
     joined the appropriate groups, the source port MUST transmit IP 
 
  Stopp & Hickman                                            [Page 4] 

  INTERNET-DRAFT   Methodology for IP Multicast Benchmarking Aug. 2003 


     multicast frames destined for these groups. The destination test 
     ports MAY send IGMP Leave Group messages after the transmission of 
     IP Multicast frames to clear the IGMP table of the DUT/SUT. 
      
     In addition, test equipment MUST validate the correct and proper 
     forwarding actions of the devices they test in order to ensure the 
     receipt of the frames that are involved in the test. 
   

  3.1. Test Considerations 
   
     The methodology assumes a uniform medium topology. Issues regarding 
     mixed transmission media, such as speed mismatch, headers 
     differences, etc., are not specifically addressed. Flow control, 
     QoS and other non-essential traffic or traffic-affecting mechanisms 
     affecting the variable under test MUST be disabled.  Modifications 
     to the collection procedures might need to be made to accommodate 
     the transmission media actually tested.  These accommodations MUST 
     be presented with the test results. 

     An actual flow of test traffic may be required to prime related 
     mechanisms, (e.g., process RPF events, build device caches, etc.) 
     to optimally forward subsequent traffic.  Therefore, before an 
     initial, measured forwarding test trial, the test apparatus MUST 
     generate test traffic utilizing the same addressing characteristics 
     to the DUT/SUT that will subsequently be used to measure the 
     DUT/SUT response.  The test monitor should ensure the correct 
     forwarding of traffic by the DUT/SUT. The priming action need only 
     be repeated to keep the associated information current. 
      
   
  3.1.1. IGMP Support 
       
     All of the ingress and egress interfaces MAY support any version of 
     IGMP.  The IGMP version on the ingress interface MUST be the same 
     version of IGMP that is being tested on the egress interfaces. 
      
     Each of the ingress and egress interfaces SHOULD be able to respond 
     to IGMP queries during the test. 
      
     Each of the ingress and egress interfaces SHOULD also send LEAVE 
     (running IGMP version 2 or later) after each test. 
      
      
  3.1.2. Group Addresses 
      
     It is intended that the collection of benchmarks prescribed in this 
     document be executed in an isolated lab environment.  That is to 
     say, the test traffic offered the tested devices MUST NOT traverse 
     a live internet, intranet, or other production network.

     Assuming the above, there is no restriction to the use of multicast 
     addresses to compose the test traffic other than those assignments 
     imposed by IANA.  The IANA assignments MUST be regarded for 
     operational consistency.  For multicast address assignments see: 
      
           http://www.iana.org/assignments/multicast-addresses 
      
     Address selection does not need to be restricted to 
     Administratively Scoped IP Multicast addresses. 
      
       
  3.1.3. Frame Sizes 
       
     Each test SHOULD be run with different multicast frame sizes. For 
     Ethernet, the recommended sizes are 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 1280, 
     and 1518 byte frames. 
      
     Other link layer technologies MAY be used. The minimum and maximum 
     frame lengths of the link layer technology in use SHOULD be tested. 
      
     When testing with different frame sizes, the DUT/SUT configuration 
     MUST remain the same. 
      
      
  3.1.4. TTL 
       
     The data plane test traffic should have a TTL value large enough to 
     traverse the DUT/SUT. 
      
     The TTL in IGMP control plane messages is in compliance with the 
     version of IGMP in use. 
      
      
  3.1.5. Trial Duration 
      
     The duration of the test portion of each trial SHOULD be at least 
     30 seconds.  This parameter MUST be included as part of the results 
     reporting for each methodology. 

       
  4. Forwarding and Throughput 
   
  This section contains the description of the tests that are related 
  to the characterization of the frame forwarding of a DUT/SUT in a 
  multicast environment.  Some metrics extend the concept of throughput 
  presented in RFC 1242.  Forwarding Rate is cited in RFC 2285.

  4.1. Mixed Class Throughput 
   
     Objective: 
      
     To determine the throughput of a DUT/SUT when both unicast class 
     frames and multicast class frames are offered simultaneously to a 
     fixed number of interfaces as defined in RFC 2432. 
       
      
     Procedure: 
      
     Multicast and unicast traffic are mixed together in the same 
     aggregated traffic stream in order to simulate the non-homogenous 
     networking environment.  
      
     The following events MUST occur before offering test traffic: 
      
          o All DUT/SUT egress interfaces configured to receive 
            multicast traffic MUST join all configured multicast 
            groups; 
          o The DUT/SUT MUST learn the appropriate unicast addresses; 
            and 
          o Group membership and unicast address learning MUST be 
            verified through some externally observable method. 

     The intended load [Ma98] SHOULD be configured as alternating 
     multicast frames and unicast frames to a single ingress interface 
     in a 50-50 ratio.  The unicast frames MUST be configured to 
     transmit in a round-robin fashion to all of the egress interfaces.  
     The multicast frames MUST be configured to transmit to all of the 
     egress interfaces. 
      
     Mixed class throughput measurement is defined in RFC2432 [Du98]. A 
     search algorithm MUST be utilized to determine the throughput for 
     both unicast class and multicast class traffic in a mixed class 
     environment. 
      
      
     Reporting Format: 
      
     The following configuration parameters MUST be reflected in the 
     results specific to this methodology: 
      
          o Frame size(s) 
          o Number of tested egress interfaces on the DUT/SUT 
          o Test duration 
          o IGMP version 
          o Total number of multicast groups 
          o Traffic distribution for unicast and multicast traffic 
            classes 
          o The ratio of multicast and unicast traffic must be declared

     The following results MUST be reflected in the results specific to 
     this methodology: 
      
          o Mixed Class Throughput as defined in RFC2432 [Du98], 
            including: Throughput per unicast and multicast traffic 
            classes. 
      
     The Mixed Class Throughput results for each test SHOULD be reported 
     in the form of a table with a row for each of the tested frame 
     sizes per the recommendations in section 3.1.3.  Each row SHOULD 
     specify the intended load, number of multicast frames offered, 
     number of unicast frames offered and measured throughput per class. 


  4.2.  Scaled Group Forwarding Matrix 
   
     Objective: 
      
     To determine Forwarding Rate as a function of tested multicast 
     groups for a fixed number of tested DUT/SUT ports. 
      
      
     Procedure: 

     This is an iterative procedure. The destination test port(s) MUST 
     join an initial number of multicast groups on the first iteration.  
     All DUT/SUT destination test port(s) configured to receive 
     multicast traffic MUST join all configured multicast groups.  The 
     recommended number of groups to join on the first iteration is 10 
     groups.  Multicast traffic is subsequently transmitted to all 
     groups joined on this iteration. 
      
     The number of multicast groups joined by each destination test port 
     is then incremented, or scaled, by an additional number of 
     multicast groups.  The recommended granularity of additional groups 
     to join per iteration is 10, although the tester MAY choose a finer 
     granularity.  Multicast traffic is subsequently transmitted to all 
     groups joined during this iteration. 
      
     The total number of multicast groups joined MUST not exceed the 
     capacity of the DUT/SUT. Both Group Join Delay and Group Capacity 
     results MUST be known prior to running this test. 

      
     Reporting Format: 
      
     The following configuration parameters MUST be reflected in the 
     results specific to this methodology:

          o Frame size(s)  
          o Number of tested egress interfaces on the DUT/SUT  
          o Test duration  
          o IGMP version 
      
     The following results MUST be reflected in the results specific to 
     this methodology: 
      
          o The total number of multicast groups joined for that 
            iteration   
          o Total number of frames transmitted  
          o Total number of frames received 
          o Offered load 
          o Forwarding rate determined for that iteration 
      
     The Scaled Group Forwarding results for each test SHOULD be 
     reported in the form of a table with a row representing each 
     iteration of the test.  Each row or iteration SHOULD specify the 
     total number of groups joined for that iteration, total number of 
     frames transmitted, total number of frames received and the 
     aggregate forwarding rate determined for that iteration. 


  4.3. Aggregated Multicast Throughput 
   
     Objective: 
      
     To determine the maximum rate at which none of the offered frames 
     to be forwarded through N destination interfaces of the same 
     multicast groups are dropped. 
      
      
     Procedure: 
      
     Offer multicast traffic at an initial fixed offered load to a fixed 
     set of interfaces with a fixed number of groups at a fixed frame 
     length for a fixed duration of time.  All destination test ports 
     MUST join all specified multicast groups. 
      
     If any frame loss is detected, the offered load is decreased and 
     the sender will transmit again.  An iterative search algorithm MUST 
     be utilized to determine the maximum offered frame rate with a zero 
     frame loss. 
      
     Each iteration will involve varying the offered load of the 
     multicast traffic, while keeping the set of interfaces, number of 
     multicast groups, frame length and test duration fixed, until the 
     maximum rate at which none of the offered frames are dropped is 
     determined. 
      
     Parameters to be measured MUST include the offered load at which no 
     frame loss occurred.

  5. Forwarding Latency 
   
     This section presents methodologies relating to the 
     characterization of the forwarding latency of a DUT/SUT in a 
     multicast environment. It extends the concept of latency 
     characterization presented in RFC 2544. 
      
     To lessen the effect of frame buffering in the DUT/SUT, the latency 
     tests MUST be run at the measured multicast throughput level of the 
     DUT; multicast latency at other offered loads is optional. 
      
     Lastly, RFC 1242 and RFC 2544 draw a distinction between device 
     types: "store and forward" and "bit-forwarding." Each type impacts 
     how latency is collected and subsequently presented. See the 
     related RFCs for more information.  In practice, much of the test 
     equipment will collect the latency measurement for one type or the 
     other, and, if needed, mathematically derive the reported value by 
     the addition or subtraction of values accounting for medium 
     propagation delay of the frame, bit times to the timestamp trigger 
     within the frame, etc.

  5.1. Multicast Latency 
   
     Objective: 
      
     To produce a set of multicast latency measurements from a single, 
     multicast ingress interface of a DUT/SUT through multiple, egress 
     multicast interfaces of that same DUT/SUT as provided for by the 
     metric "Multicast Latency" in RFC 2432. 
      
     The Procedures highlighted below attempt to draw from the 
     collection methodology for latency in RFC 2544 to the degree 
     possible.  The methodology addresses two topological scenarios: one 
     for a single device (DUT) characterization; a second scenario is 
     presented or multiple device (SUT) characterization. 
      
      
     Procedure: 
      
     If the test trial is to characterize latency across a single Device 
     Under Test (DUT), an example test topology might take the form of 
     Figure 1 in section 3.  That is, a single DUT with one ingress 
     interface receiving the multicast test traffic from frame-
     transmitting component of the test apparatus and n egress 
     interfaces on the same DUT forwarding the multicast test traffic 
     back to the frame-receiving component of the test apparatus.  Note 
     that n reflects the number of TESTED egress interfaces on the DUT 
     actually expected to forward the test traffic (as opposed to 
     configured but untested, non-forwarding interfaces, for example). 
      
     If the multicast latencies are to be taken across multiple devices 
     forming a System Under Test (SUT), an example test topology might 
     take the form of Figure 2 in section 3. 

     The trial duration SHOULD be 120 seconds to be consistent with RFC 
     2544.  The nature of the latency measurement, "store and forward" 
     or "bit forwarding," MUST be associated with the related test 
     trial(s) and disclosed in the results report. 
      
     End-to-end reachability of the test traffic path MUST be verified 
     prior to the engagement of a test trial.  This implies that 
     subsequent measurements are intended to characterize the latency 
     across the tested device's or devices' normal traffic forwarding 
     path (e.g., faster hardware-based engines) of the device(s) as 
     opposed a non-standard traffic processing path (e.g. slower, 
     software-based exception handlers).  If the test trial is to be 
     executed with the intent of characterizing a non-optimal, 
     forwarding condition, then a description of the exception 
     processing conditions being characterized MUST be included with the 
     trial's results. 
      
     A test traffic stream is presented to the DUT. It is RECOMMENDED to 
     offer traffic at the measured aggregated multicast throughput rate 
 
  Stopp & Hickman                                           [Page 16] 

  INTERNET-DRAFT   Methodology for IP Multicast Benchmarking Aug. 2003 


     (Section 4.3).  At the mid-point of the trial's duration, the test 
     apparatus MUST inject a uniquely identifiable ("tagged") frame into 
     the test traffic frames being presented.  This tagged frame will be 
     the basis for the latency measurements. By "uniquely identifiable," 
     it is meant that the test apparatus MUST be able to discern the 
     "tagged" frame from the other frames comprising the test traffic 
     set.  A frame generation timestamp, Timestamp A, reflecting the 
     completion of the transmission of the tagged frame by the test 
     apparatus, MUST be determined.  
      
     The test apparatus then monitors frames from the DUT's tested 
     egress interface(s) for the expected tagged frame(s) until the 
     cessation of traffic generation at the end of the configured trial 
     duration. 
      
     The test apparatus MUST record the time of the successful detection 
     of a tagged frame from a tested egress interface with a timestamp, 
     Timestamp B.  A set of Timestamp B values MUST be collected for all 
     tested egress interfaces of the DUT/SUT.  See RFC 1242 [Br91] for 
     additional discussion regarding store and forward devices and bit 
     forwarding devices. 
      
     A trial MUST be considered INVALID should any of the following 
     conditions occur in the collection of the trial data: 
      
          o Forwarded test frames directed to improper destinations. 
          o Unexpected differences between Intended Load and Offered 
            Load or unexpected differences between Offered Load and the       
            resulting Forwarding Rate(s) on the DUT/SUT egress ports. 
          o Forwarded test frames improperly formed or frame header 
            fields improperly manipulated. 
          o Failure to forward required tagged frame(s) on all expected 
            egress interfaces. 
          o Reception of a tagged frame by the test apparatus outside 
            the configured test duration interval or 5 seconds, 
            whichever is greater. 
      
     Data from invalid trials SHOULD be considered inconclusive.  Data 
     from invalid trials MUST not form the basis of comparison. 
      
     The set of latency measurements, M, composed from each latency 
     measurement taken from every ingress/tested egress interface 
     pairing MUST be determined from a valid test trial: 
      
           M = { (Timestamp B(E0) - Timestamp A),  
                 (Timestamp B(E1) - Timestamp A), ... 
                 (Timestamp B(En) - Timestamp A) }

     where (E0 ... En) represents the range of all tested egress 
     interfaces and Timestamp B represents a tagged frame detection 
     event for a given DUT/SUT tested egress interface. 
      
     A more continuous profile MAY be built from a series of individual 
     measurements.

     The following configuration parameters MUST be reflected in the 
     results specific to this methodology: 
      
          o Frame size(s)  
          o Number of tested egress interfaces on the DUT/SUT  
          o Test duration  
          o IGMP version 
          o Offered load 
          o Total number of multicast groups 
      
     The following results MUST be reflected in the results specific to 
     this methodology: 
      
          o The time units of the presented latency MUST be uniform and 
            with sufficient precision for the medium or media being 
            tested. 
          o Specifically, when reporting the results of a valid test 
            trial, the set of all latencies related to the tested 
            ingress and each tested egress DUT/SUT interface of MUST be 
            presented. 
      
     The latency results for each test SHOULD be reported in the form of 
     a table, with a row for each of the tested frame sizes per the 
     recommended frame sizes in section 3.1.3, and SHOULD preserve the 
     relationship of latency to ingress/egress interface(s) to assist in 
     trending across multiple trials.

     Objective: 
      
     To determine the difference between the maximum latency measurement 
     and the minimum latency measurement from a collected set of 
     latencies produced by the Multicast Latency benchmark.

     multicast latencies, M, where M is composed of individual 
     forwarding latencies between DUT frame ingress and DUT frame egress 
     port pairs. E.g.: 
      
                     M = {L(I,E1),L(I,E2), ..., L(I,En)} 
      
     where L is the latency between a tested ingress interface, I, of 
     the DUT, and Ex a specific, tested multicast egress interface of 
     the DUT.  E1 through En are unique egress interfaces on the DUT. 
      
     From the collected multicast latency measurements in set M, 
     identify MAX(M), where MAX is a function that yields the largest 
     latency value from set M. 
      
     Identify MIN(M), when MIN is a function that yields the smallest 
     latency value from set M. 
      
     The Max/Min value is determined from the following formula: 
      
                          Result = MAX(M) - MIN(M) 
      
     A more continuous profile MAY be built from a series of individual

     relationship of latency to ingress/egress interface(s) to assist in 
     trending across multiple trials. 
   
   
  6. Overhead 
   
     This section presents methodology relating to the characterization 
     of the overhead delays associated with explicit operations found in 
     multicast environments. 
   

  6.1. Group Join Delay 
   
     Objective: 
      
     To determine the time duration it takes a DUT/SUT to start 
     forwarding multicast frames from the time a successful IGMP group 
     membership report has been issued to the DUT/SUT. 
      
      
     Procedure: 
      
     Prior to sending any IGMP Group Membership Reports used to 
     calculate the group join delay, it MUST be verified through 
     externally observable means that the destination test ports are not 
     currently a member of any of the specified multicast groups.  If 
     any of the egress interfaces forward multicast frames, the test is 
     not valid. 
      
     Once verification is complete, multicast traffic for all relevant 
     multicast group addresses MUST be offered to the ingress interface 
     prior to receipt or processing of any IGMP Group Membership Report 
     messages.  It is RECOMMENDED to offer traffic at the measured 
     aggregated multicast throughput rate (Section 4.3). 
      
     After the multicast traffic has been started, each destination test 
     port (See Figure 1) SHOULD send one IGMP Group Membership Report 
     with one or more (IGMP V3) multicast group(s) specified.  All 
     destination test ports MUST join all multicast groups offered on 
     the ingress interface of the DUT/SUT.  The test MUST be performed 
     with one multicast group and SHOULD be performed with multiple 
     groups. 
      
     The join delay is the difference in time from when the IGMP Group 
     Membership message is sent (timestamp A) and the first frame of the 
     multicast group is forwarded to a receiving egress interface 
     (timestamp B). 
      
              Group Join delay time = timestamp B - timestamp A 
      
     Timestamp A MUST be the time the last bit of the IGMP group 
     membership report is sent from the destination test port; timestamp

  INTERNET-DRAFT   Methodology for IP Multicast Benchmarking Aug. 2003 


     B MUST be the time the first bit of the first valid multicast frame 
     is forwarded on the egress interface of the DUT/SUT. 
      
      
     Reporting Format: 
      
     The following configuration parameters MUST be reflected in the 
     results specific to this methodology: 
      
          o Frame size(s)  
          o Number of tested egress interfaces on the DUT/SUT  
          o Test duration  
          o IGMP version 
          o Total number of multicast groups 
      
     The following results MUST be reflected in the results specific to 
     this methodology: 
      
          o The group join delay time per multicast group address 
          o The group join delay time per egress interface(s) 
      
     The Group Join Delay results for each test SHOULD be reported in 
     the form of a table, with a row for each of the tested frame sizes 
     per the recommendations in section 3.1.3.  Each row or iteration 
     SHOULD specify the group join delay time for each multicast group 
     per destination interface, number of frames transmitted and number 
     of frames received for that iteration. 
   

  6.2. Group Leave Delay 
   
     Objective: 
      
     To determine the time duration it takes a DUT/SUT to cease 
     forwarding multicast frames after a corresponding IGMP Leave Group 
     message has been successfully offered to the DUT/SUT. 
      
      
     Procedure: 
      
     Prior to sending any IGMP Group Leave Group messages used to 
     calculate the group leave delay, it MUST be verified through 
     externally observable means that the destination test ports are 
     currently a member of all the specified multicast groups.  If any 
     of the destination test ports do not receive multicast frames, the 
     test is not valid. 
      
     Once verification is complete, multicast traffic for all relevant 
     multicast group addresses MUST be offered to the ingress interface 
     prior to receipt or processing of any IGMP Leave Group messages.  
     It is RECOMMENDED to offer traffic at the measured aggregated 
     multicast throughput rate (Section 4.3).

  INTERNET-DRAFT   Methodology for IP Multicast Benchmarking Aug. 2003 


      
     After the multicast traffic has been started, each destination test 
     port (See Figure 1) MUST send one IGMP Leave Group message for each 
     multicast group specified.  All destination test ports MUST leave 
     all relevant multicast groups offered on the ingress interface of 
     the DUT/SUT.  The test MUST be performed with one multicast group 
     and SHOULD be performed with multiple groups. 
      
     The leave delay is the difference in time from when the IGMP Leave 
     Group message is sent (timestamp A) and the last frame of the 
     multicast group is forwarded to a receiving egress interface 
     (timestamp B). 
      
             Group Leave delay time = timestamp B - timestamp A 
      
     Timestamp A MUST be the time the last bit of the IGMP Leave Group 
     message is sent from the destination test port; timestamp B MUST be 
     the time the last bit of the last valid multicast frame is 
     forwarded on the egress interface of the DUT/SUT. 
      
      
     Reporting Format: 
      
     The following configuration parameters MUST be reflected in the 
     results specific to this methodology: 
      
          o Frame size(s)  
          o Number of tested egress interfaces on the DUT/SUT  
          o Test duration  
          o IGMP version 
          o Total number of multicast groups 
      
     The following results MUST be reflected in the results specific to 
     this methodology: 
      
          o The group leave delay time per multicast group address 
          o The group leave delay time per egress interface(s) 
      
     The Group Leave Delay results for each test SHOULD be reported in 
     the form of a table, with a row for each of the tested frame sizes 
     per the recommendations in section 3.1.3.  Each row or iteration 
     SHOULD specify the group leave delay time for each multicast group 
     per destination interface, number of frames transmitted and number 
     of frames received for that iteration.

  7. Capacity 
   
     This section offers terms relating to the identification of 
     multicast group limits of a DUT/SUT. 

  7.1. Multicast Group Capacity 
   
     Objective: 
      
     To determine the maximum number of multicast groups a DUT/SUT can 
     support while maintaining the ability to forward multicast frames 
     to all multicast groups registered to that DUT/SUT. 
      
      
     Procedure: 
      
     One or more egress interfaces of DUT/SUT will join an initial 
     number of multicast groups.  
      
     After a delay as determined by section 6.1, the ingress interface 
     MUST transmit to each group at a specified offered load.  
       
     If at least one frame for each multicast group is forwarded 
     properly by the DUT/SUT to each participating egress interface, the 
     iteration is said to pass at the current capacity.  
       
     If the iteration passes, the test will add a user defined 
     incremental value of groups to each egress interface. At the new 
     group level and resultant capacity as stated above, run the 
     iteration again. 
       
     Once the test fails, the last/previous iteration capacity that 
     passed is the stated Maximum Group Capacity result.  

      
     Reporting Format: 
      
     The following configuration parameters MUST be reflected in the 
     results specific to this methodology: 
      
          o Frame size(s)  
          o Number of tested egress interfaces on the DUT/SUT  
          o Test duration  
          o IGMP version 
          o Offered load 
      
     The following results MUST be reflected in the results specific to 
     this methodology: 
      
          o The total number of multicast group addresses that were 
            successfully forwarded through the DUT/SUT

  INTERNET-DRAFT   Methodology for IP Multicast Benchmarking Aug. 2003 


     The Multicast Group Capacity results for each test SHOULD be 
     reported in the form of a table, with a row for each of the tested 
     frame sizes per the recommendations in section 3.1.3.  Each row or 
     iteration SHOULD specify the number of multicast groups joined per 
     destination interface, number of frames transmitted and number of 
     frames received for that iteration. 
   
   
  8. Interaction 
   
     Network forwarding devices are generally required to provide more 
     functionality than just the forwarding of traffic.  Moreover, 
     network-forwarding devices may be asked to provide those functions 
     in a variety of environments.  This section offers procedures to 
     assist in the characterization of DUT/SUT behavior in consideration 
     of potentially interacting factors. 
      

  8.1. Forwarding Burdened Multicast Latency 
   
     Objective: 
      
     To produce a set of multicast latency measurements from a single 
     multicast ingress interface of a DUT/SUT through multiple egress 
     multicast interfaces of that same DUT/SUT as provided for by the 
     metric "Multicast Latency" in RFC 2432 while under the influence of 
     a traffic forwarding requirement. 
      
      
     Procedure: 
      
     The Multicast Latency metrics can be influenced by forcing the 
     DUT/SUT to perform extra processing of packets while multicast 
     class traffic is being forwarded for latency measurements. 
      
     The Burdened Forwarding Latency test MUST follow the described 
     setup in Section 5.1. 
      
     Perform a baseline measurement of latency as described in Section 
     5.1.  After the baseline measurement is obtained, the test is 
     repeated with the ingress interface offering an additional set of 
     user specified multicast group addresses which have not been joined 
     by the destination test port(s).  The offered load MUST be the same 
     as was used in the baseline measurement. 
      
     By sending such multicast class traffic, the DUT/SUT may perform a 
     lookup on the frames that may affect the processing of traffic 
     destined for the egress interface(s).

     Reporting Format: 
      
     Similar to Section 5.1, the following configuration parameters MUST 
     be reflected in the results specific to this methodology: 
      
          o Frame size(s)  
          o Number of tested egress interfaces on the DUT/SUT  
          o Test duration  
          o IGMP version 
          o Total number of multicast groups in the baseline setup 
          o Total number of additional multicast groups used to burden 
            the setup 
      
     The following results MUST be reflected in the results specific to 
     this methodology: 
      
          o The time units of the presented latency MUST be uniform and 
            with sufficient precision for the medium or media being 
            tested 
          o Specifically, when reporting the results of a valid test 
            trial, the set of all latencies related to the tested 
            ingress and each tested egress DUT/SUT interface of MUST be 
            presented 
          o Reported results from baseline measurement; section 5.1 
      
     The latency results for each test SHOULD be reported in the form of 
     a table, with a row for each of the tested frame sizes per the 
     recommended frame sizes in section 3.1.3, and SHOULD preserve the 
     relationship of latency to ingress/egress interface(s) to assist in 
     trending across multiple trials. 


  8.2. Forwarding Burdened Group Join Delay 
   
     Objective:  
      
     To determine the time duration it takes a DUT/SUT to start 
     forwarding multicast frames from the time a successful IGMP Group 
     Membership Report has been issued to the DUT/SUT while under the 
     influence of a traffic forwarding requirement. 
      
      
     Procedure: 
      
     The Group Join Delay metrics can be influenced by forcing the 
     DUT/SUT to perform extra process of packets while attempting to 
     update and maintain the IP multicast address forwarding table. 
      
     The Forwarding Burdened Group Join Delay test MUST follow the 
     described setup in Section 6.1.

     Perform a baseline measurement of group join delay as described in 
     Section 6.1.  After the baseline measurement is obtained, the test 
     is repeated with the ingress interface offering an additional set 
     of user specified multicast group address which have not been 
     joined by the destination test port(s).  The offered load MUST be 
     the same as was used in the baseline measurement. 
      
     By sending such multicast class traffic, the DUT/SUT may perform a 
     lookup on the frames that may affect the processing of the IGMP 
     Group Report messages.  
      
      
     Reporting Format: 
      
     Similar to Section 6.1, the following configuration parameters MUST 
     be reflected in the results specific to this methodology: 
      
          o Frame size(s)  
          o Number of tested egress interfaces on the DUT/SUT  
          o Test duration  
          o IGMP version 
          o Total number of multicast groups in the baseline setup 
          o Total number of additional multicast groups used to burden 
            the setup 
      
     The following results MUST be reflected in the results specific to 
     this methodology: 
      
          o The group join delay time per multicast group address 
          o The group join delay time per egress interface(s) 
          o Reported results from baseline measurement; section 6.1 
      
     The Group Join Delay results for each test SHOULD be reported in 
     the form of a table, with a row for each of the tested frame sizes 
     per the recommendations in section 3.1.3.  Each row or iteration 
     SHOULD specify the group join delay time for each multicast group 
     per destination interface, number of frames transmitted and number 
     of frames received for that iteration.
