     1. Introduction 

     Results of several recent surveys indicate that LDP is becoming one of 
     the key enabler of large number of MPLS based services such as Layer 2 
     and Layer 3 VPNs. Given the revenue that these services generate for the 
     service providers, it becomes imperative that reliability and recovery

     Internet-Draft     LDP Data Plane Convergence       February 2007 
                         Benchmarking Methodology 
                              

     of these services from failures is very quick or may be un-noticeable to 
     the end user. This is ensured when implementations can guarantee very 
     short convergence times from any planned or unplanned failures. Given 
     the  criticality  of  network  convergence,  service  providers  are 
     considering convergence as a key metric to evaluate router architectures 
     and  LDP  implementations.  End  customers  monitor  the  service  level 
     agreements based on total packets lost in a given time frame, hence 
     convergence becomes a direct measure of reliability and quality.  
      
     This document describes the methodology for benchmarking LDP Data 
     Convergence.  An accompanying document describes the Terminology related 
     to LDP data convergence benchmarking [LDP-TERM].  The primary motivation 
     for this work is the increased focus on minimizing convergence time for 
     LDP as an alternative to other solutions such as MPLS Fast Reroute (i.e. 
     protection techniques using RSVP-TE extensions). The procedures outlined 
     here are transparent to the Advertisement type (Downstream on Demand Vs 
     Downstream Unsolicited), Label Retention mode in use as well as the 
     Label Distribution Control and hence can be used in all of these types. 
      
     The test cases defined in this document considers black-box type tests 
     that emulate the network events causing route convergence events. This 
     is similar to that defined in [IGP APP]. The LDP methodology (and 
     terminology) for benchmarking LDP FEC convergence is independent to any 
     link-state IGP such as ISIS [IGP-ISIS] and OSPF [IGP-OSPF].  These 
     methodologies apply to IPv4 and IPv6 traffic as well as IPv4 and IPv6 
     IGPs. 
      
     Future versions of this document will include ECMP benchmarks, LDP 
     targeted peers and  correlated failure scenarios.  
      
      
     2. Existing definitions 

     For the sake of clarity and continuity this RFC adopts the template 
     for definitions set out in Section 2 of RFC 1242.  Definitions are 
     indexed and grouped together in sections for ease of reference.

     Internet-Draft     LDP Data Plane Convergence       February 2007 
                         Benchmarking Methodology 
                              

      
     The reader is assumed to be familiar with the commonly used MPLS  
     terminology, some of which is defined in [LDP-TERM].   
      
      
     3. Test Considerations 

        This section discusses the fundamentals of LDP data plane convergence 
        benchmarking:   

            -Network events that cause rerouting 
            -Failure detections 
            -Data traffic 
            -Traffic generation 
            -IGP Selection     
         
        3.1. Convergence Events 

        FEC rerouting, or LDP route calculation is triggered by link or node 
        failures downstream of the DUT that impact the network stability: 

            - Interface Shutdown on DUT side with POS Alarm  
            - Interface Shutdown on remote side with POS Alarm  
            - Interface Shutdown on DUT side with BFD 
            - Interface Shutdown on remote side with BFD  
            - Fiber Pull on DUT side  
            - Fiber Pull on remote side   
            - Online Insertion and Removal (OIR) of line cards on DUT side   
            - Online Insertion and Removal (OIR) on remote side   
             
         
        3.2. Failure Detection [LDP-TERM] 

        Local failures can be detected via SONET failure with directly 
        connected LSR.  Failure detection may vary with the type of alarm - 
        LOS, AIS, or RDI. Failures on Ethernet links such as Gigabit Ethernet 
        rely upon Layer 3 signaling indication for failure.   

        3.3. Use of Data Traffic for LDP Convergence  

        Customers of service providers use packet loss as the metric for 
        failover time. Packet loss is an externally observable event having

     Internet-Draft     LDP Data Plane Convergence       February 2007 
                         Benchmarking Methodology 
                              

        direct impact on customers' application performance.  LDP convergence 
        benchmarking aim at measuring traffic loss to determine the down time 
        when a convergence event occurs. 

        3.4. Selection of IGP 

        The LDP convergence methodology presented here is independent of the 
        type of underlying IGP used.  

        3.5. LDP FEC Scaling 

        The number of installed LDP FECs will impact the measured LDP 
        convergence time for the entire LDP FEC table. To obtain results 
        similar to those that would be observed in an operation network, it 
        is recommended that number of installed routes closely approximate 
        that for the routers in the real network. The number of IGP areas, or 
        levels may not impact the LDP convergence time, however it does 
        impact the performance of the IGP route convergence.  

        3.6. Timers  

         There are some timers that will impact the measured LDP Convergence  
        time. The following timers should be configured to the minimum value  
        prior to beginning execution of the test cases: 
      
             Timer                                   Recommended Value 
             -----                                   ----------------- 
             Link Failure Indication Delay           <10milliseconds 
             IGP Hello Timer                         1 second 
             LDP Hello Timer                        1 second  
             LDP Hold Timer                          3 seconds 
             IGP Dead-Interval                       3 seconds 
             LSA Generation Delay                    0  
             LSA Flood Packet Pacing                 0 
             LSA Retransmission Packet Pacing        0 
             SPF Delay                               0 
         

        3.7. BGP Configuration 

        The observed LDP convergence numbers could be different if BGP routes 
        are installed, and will further worsens, if any failure event imposed 
        to measure the LDP convergence causes BGP routes to flap.

        3.8. Traffic generation 

        It is suggested that at least 3 traffic streams be configured using a 
        traffic generator. In order to monitor the DUT performance for 
        recovery times a set of route prefixes should be advertised before 
        traffic is sent. The traffic should be configured to be sent to these 
        routes.  

        A typical example would be configuring the traffic generator to send 
        the traffic to the first and last of the advertised routes. Also In 
        order to have a good understanding of the performance behavior one 
        may choose to send the traffic to the route, lying at the middle of 
        the advertised routes. For example, if 100 routes are advertised, the 
        user should send traffic to route prefix number 1, route prefix    
        number 50 and to last route prefix advertised, which is 100 in this 
        example. It is recommended that the traffic is not generated in 
        round-robin fashion to each of the prefixes. 

     4. Test Setup 

        Topologies to be used for benchmarking the LDP Convergence:

              --------   A  --------

     5. Test Methodology 

        The procedure described here can apply to all the convergence 
        benchmarking cases.  

           Objective 

           To benchmark the LDP Data Plane Convergence time as seen on the 
        DUT when a Convergence event occurs resulting in the current best FEC 
        is not reachable anymore.  

           Test Setup 

             - The DUT will have 1 interface connected to the traffic 
               generator. 
             - The DUT will also be connected to a downstream node over 2 
               parallel interfaces. 
             - The downstream neighbor will be connected to a traffic 
               analyzer 
              
           Test Configuration 
         
            1. Configure LDP and other necessary Routing Protocol 
          configuration on the DUT and on the supporting devices  
            2. Advertise FECs over parallel interfaces upstream to the DUT.

     7.  Security Considerations 

         Documents of this type do not directly affect the security of 
         the Internet or of corporate networks as long as benchmarking 
         is not performed on devices or systems connected to operating 
         networks.
