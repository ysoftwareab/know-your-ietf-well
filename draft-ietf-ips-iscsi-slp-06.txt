Abstract

   The iSCSI protocol provides a way for hosts to access SCSI devices
   over an IP network.  This document defines the use of the Service
   Location Protocol (SLP) by iSCSI hosts, devices, and management
   services, along with the SLP service type templates that describe the
   services they provide.

1.  Introduction

   iSCSI [iSCSI] is a protocol used to transport SCSI [SAM2] commands,
   data, and status across an IP network.  This protocol is connection-
   oriented, and is currently defined over TCP.  iSCSI uses a client-
   server relationship.  The client end of the connection is an
   initiator, and sends SCSI commands; the server end of the connection
   is called a target, and receives and executes the commands.

   There are several methods an iSCSI initiator can use to find the
   targets to which it should connect.  Two of these methods can be
   accomplished without the use of SLP:

   - Each target and its address can be statically configured on the
     initiator.

   - Each address providing targets can be configured on the initiator;
     iSCSI provides a mechanism by which the initiator can query the
     address for a list of targets.

   The above methods are further defined in "iSCSI Naming and Discovery
   Requirements" [NDT].

   Each of the above methods requires a small amount of configuration to
   be done on each initiator.  The ability to discover targets and name
   services without having to configure initiators is a desirable
   feature.  The Service Location Protocol (SLP) [RFC2608] is an IETF
   standards track protocol that provides several features that will
   simplify locating iSCSI services.  This document describes how SLP
   can be used in iSCSI environments to discover targets, addresses
   providing targets, and storage management servers.


2.  Notation Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Terminology

   Here are some definitions that may aid readers that are unfamiliar
   with either SLP, SCSI, or iSCSI.  Some of these definitions have been
   reproduced from [RFC2608] and "Finding an RSIP Server with SLP"
   [RFC3105].

   User Agent (UA)            A process working on the client's behalf
                              to establish contact with some service.
                              The UA retrieves service information from
                              the Service Agents or Directory Agents.

   Service Agent (SA)         A process working on behalf of one or more
                              services to advertise the services and
                              their capabilities.

   Directory Agent (DA)       A process which collects service
                              advertisements.  There can only be one DA
                              present per given host.

   Scope                      A named set of services, typically making
                              up a logical administrative group.

   Service Advertisement      A URL, attributes, and a lifetime
                              (indicating how long the advertisement is
                              valid), providing service access
                              information and capabilities description
                              for a particular service.

   Initiator                  A logical entity, typically within a host,
                              that sends SCSI commands to targets to be
                              executed.  An initiator is usually present
                              in the form of a device driver.

   Target                     A logical entity, typically within a
                              storage controller or gateway, that
                              receives SCSI commands from an initiator
                              and executes them.  A target includes one
                              or more Logical Units (LUs); each LU is a
                              SCSI device, such as a disk or tape drive.

   iSCSI Name                 A UTF-8 character string which serves as a
                              unique identifier for iSCSI initiators and
                              targets.  Its format and usage is further
                              defined in [NDT].

   iSCSI Client               A logical entity, typically a host, which
                              includes at least one iSCSI Initiator.

   iSCSI Server               A logical entity, typically a storage
                              controller or gateway, which includes at
                              least one iSCSI Target.

   Storage Management Server  An addressable entity that provides
                              management services that benefit an iSCSI
                              environment.  "Storage management server"
                              is used as a generic term, rather than a
                              specific protocol or service.


4.  Using SLP for iSCSI Service Discovery

   Two entities are involved in iSCSI discovery.  The end result is that
   an iSCSI initiator (e.g. a host) discovers iSCSI targets, usually
   provided by storage controllers or gateways.

   iSCSI targets are registered with SLP as a set of service URLs, one
   for each address on which the target may be accessed.  Initiators

Internet Draft                iSCSI and SLP                   March 2003


   discover these targets using SLP service requests.  Targets that do
   not directly support SLP, or are under the control of a management
   service, may be registered by a proxy service agent as part of the
   software providing this service.

   iSCSI entities may also use SLP to discover higher-level management
   services where needed.

   This section first describes the use of SLP for discovery of targets
   by iSCSI initiators, and then describes the use of SLP to discover
   storage management servers.

   This document assumes that SLPv2 will be used when discovering iSCSI-
   related services; no attempt is made to include support for SLPv1.

4.1.  Discovering iSCSI Targets using SLP

   The following diagram shows the relationship between iSCSI clients,
   servers, initiators, and targets.  An iSCSI client includes at least
   one iSCSI initiator, and an SLP user agent (UA).  An iSCSI server
   includes at least one iSCSI target, and an SLP service agent (SA).
   Some entities, such as extended copy engines, include both initiators
   and targets.  These include both an SA, for its targets to be
   discovered, and a UA, for its initiator(s) to discover other targets.

   In the above drawing, the iSCSI server has three iSCSI targets that
   the client could discover, named "one", "two" and "three".  The iSCSI
   client has an iSCSI initiator with the name "myhost".  The iSCSI
   client may use the initiator name in its SLP Service Requests as a
   filter to discover only targets that are configured to accept iSCSI
   connections from "myhost".

   Each iSCSI target and initiator has a unique name, called an iSCSI
   Name.  This identifier is the same regardless of the network path
   (through adapter cards, networks, interfaces on the storage device)
   over which the target is discovered and accessed.  For this example,
   the iSCSI names "one" and "two", and "three" are used for the
   targets; the initiator uses the name "myhost".  An actual iSCSI name
   would incorporate more structure, including a naming authority, and
   is not described here.

   Each of the iSCSI targets in the drawing can appear at two addresses,
   since two network interfaces are present.  Each target, would have
   two service URLs.

   An iSCSI target URL consists of its fully qualified host name or IP
   address, the TCP port on which it is listening, and its iSCSI name.
   An iSCSI server must register each of its individual targets at each
   of its network addresses.

   The iSCSI server constructs a service advertisement of the type
   "service:iscsi:target" for each of the service URLs it wishes to
   register.  The advertisement contains a lifetime, along with other
   attributes which are defined in the service template.

   If the server in the above drawing is listening at TCP port 3260 for
   both network addresses, the service URLs registered would be:

   - 192.0.2.131:3260/one

   - 192.0.2.131:3260/two

   - 192.0.2.131:3260/three

   - 192.0.2.3:3260/one

   - 192.0.2.3:3260/two

   - 192.0.2.3:3260/three

   The remainder of the discovery procedure is identical to that used by
   any client/server pair implementing SLP:

Internet Draft                iSCSI and SLP                   March 2003


   1. If an SLP DA is found, the SA contacts the DA and registers
      the service advertisement.  Whether or not one or more SLPv2
      DAs are discovered, the SA maintains the advertisement itself
      and answers multicast UA queries directly.

   2. When the iSCSI initiator requires contact information for an
      iSCSI target, the UA either contacts the DA using unicast or
      the SA using multicast.  If a UA is configured with the address
      of the SA, it may avoid multicast and contact an SA using
      unicast.  The UA includes a query based on
      the attributes to indicate the characteristics of the
      target(s) it requires.

   3. Once the UA has the host name or address of the iSCSI server
      as well as the port number and iSCSI Target Name, it can begin the
      normal iSCSI login to the target.

   As information contained in the iSCSI target template may exceed
   common network datagram sizes, the SLP implementation for both UAs
   and SAs supporting this template MUST implement SLP over TCP.


4.1.1.  Finding Targets Based on Initiator Credentials

   To be allowed access to an iSCSI target, an initiator must be
   authenticated.  The initiator may be required by the target to
   produce one or more of the following credentials:


   - - An iSCSI Initiator Name

   - - An IP address

   - - A CHAP, SRP, or Kerberos credential

   - - Any combination of the above

   Most iSCSI targets allow access to only one or two initiators.  In
   the ideal discovery scenario, an initiator would send an SLP request,
   and receive responses ONLY for those targets to which the initiator
   is guaranteed a successful login.  To achieve this goal, the iSCSI
   target template contains the following attributes, each of which
   allows a list of values:

   1. auth-name - This attribute contains the list of initiator names
      allowed to access this target, or the value "any", indicating
      that no specific initiator name is required.




Bakke                    Expires September 2003                 [Page 8]

Internet Draft                iSCSI and SLP                   March 2003


   2. auth-addr - This attribute contains the list of host names
      and/or IP addresses which will be allowed access to this target,
      or the value "any", indicating that no specific address or
      host name is required.  If a large number of addresses is to
      be allowed (perhaps a subnet), this attribute may contain the
      value "any".

   3. auth-cred - This attribute contains a list of "method/identifier"
      credentials that will be allowed access to the target, provided
      they can produce the correct password or other verifier during
      the login process.  If no specific credentials are required, the
      value "any" is used.

   The above identifiers follow the semantics described in the IP
   Storage Authentication MIB [AUTH-MIB].  Examples showing initiator
   searches based on auth-xxxx attributes are shown in the target-
   specific template section below.


4.1.2.  Supporting Access by Multiple Identities to the Same Target

   If a target is to allow access to multiple host identities, more than
   one combination of auth-xxxx attributes will need to be present.
   Since service URLs must be unique, each of these must be registered
   under its own service URL.

   For systems that support the configuration of multiple identities to
   access a target, the service URL must contain an additional, opaque
   string defining the identity.  This appears after the iSCSI name in
   the URL string, and is separated by a "/".  Each registered (target-
   address, target-name, initiator-identity) tuple can then register its
   own set of auth-xxxx attributes.

   An initiator-identity is equivalent to the authentication identity
   defined in [AUTH-MIB].


4.1.3.  Using SLP in a Non-Multicast Environment

   In some networks, the use of multicast for discovery purposes is
   either unavailable or not allowed.  Such networks include public or
   service-provider networks that are placed in between an iSCSI client
   and server; these are probably most common between two iSCSI
   gateways, one at a storage service provider site, and one at a
   customer site.

   In these networks, an initiator may, instead or in addition to its DA
   configuration, allow the addresses of one or more SAs to be

   configured.  The initiator would then make unicast SLP service
   requests directly to these SAs, without the use of multicast to first
   discover them.

   This functionality is well within the scope of the current SLP
   protocol.  However, it does have two consequences for implementors:

   - A service-agent responding to requests for iSCSI targets MUST
     implement SLP over TCP; UDP only is not enough.  This is not
     an issue, since TCP is a requirement for iSCSI implementations
     that use SLP for other reasons.

   - An initiator configured to make direct, unicast requests to an
     SA will have to add this to the SLP API, if it is following the
     service location API defined in [RFC2614].  This capability
     is being added to the next revision of the API, in [2614BIS].

4.2.  Discovering Storage Management Services using SLP

   Storage management servers can be built to manage and control access
   to targets in a variety of ways.  They can also provide extended
   services beyond discovery, which could include storage allocation and
   management.  None of these services are defined here; the intent of
   this document is to allow these services to be discovered by both
   clients and servers, in addition to the target discovery already
   being performed.

   The following drawing shows an iSCSI client, an iSCSI server, and a
   storage management server.  To simplify the drawing, the second IP
   network is not shown, but is assumed to exist.  The storage
   management server would use its own protocol (smsp) to provide
   capabilities to iSCSI clients and servers; these clients and servers
   can both use SLP to discover the storage management server.

   Note the difference between the storage management server model and
   the previously-defined target discovery model.  When target discovery
   was used, the iSCSI Server implemented an SA, to be discovered by the
   initiator's UA.  In the storage management server model, the iSCSI
   clients and servers both implement UAs, and the management server
   implements the SA.

   A storage management server's URL contains the domain name or IP
   address and TCP port.  No other information is required.

   The storage management server constructs a service advertisement of
   the type "service:iscsi:sms" for each of the addresses at which it
   appears.  The advertisement contains the URL, a lifetime, along with
   other attributes which are defined in the service template.

   The remainder of the discovery procedure is identical to that used to
   discover iSCSI targets, except that both initiators and targets would
   normally be "clients" of the storage management service.

   Targets that support a storage management service implement a UA in
   addition to the SA.  A target may alternatively just implement the
   UA, and allow the storage management service to advertise its targets
   appropriately by providing an SA and registering the appropriate
   service:iscsi:target registrations on the target's behalf; the target
   device would not have to advertise its own targets.  This has no
   impact on the initiator.

   This allows the initiators' discovery of targets to be completely
   interoperable regardless of which storage management service is used,
   or whether one is used at all, or whether the target registrations
   are provided directly by the target or by the management service.


4.3.  NAT and NAPT Considerations

   Since SLP provides IP address and TCP port information within its
   payload, the addresses an SA or DA advertise may not be the same as
   those a UA must use if a Network Address(/Port) Translation
   (NAT/NAPT) device is present between the UA and the SA.  This may
   result in the UA discovering address information that is unusable.
   Here are a few recommendations to handle this:


   - A fully-qualified domain name (i.e. not an IP address) SHOULD be
     used in service URLs, the mgmt-entity attribute, and the auth-addr
     attribute.

   - The default, IANA-assigned iSCSI TCP port number SHOULD be used in
     service URLs, wherever possible.

   - If advertising service URLs through a translating device (e.g. a
     NAT/NAPT device), and the FQDN, IP address, or TCP port will be
     translated, the translating device can provide an SLPv2 proxy
     capability to do the translation.


4.4.  Internationalization Considerations

   SLP allows internationalized strings to be registered and retrieved.
   Attributes in the template that are not marked with an 'L' (literal)
   will be registered in a localized manner.  An "en" (English)
   localization MUST be registered, and others MAY be registered.

Internet Draft                iSCSI and SLP                   March 2003


   Attributes that include non-ASCII characters will be encoded using
   UTF-8, as discussed in [STRINGPREP] and [NAMEPREP].


5.  iSCSI SLP Templates

   Three templates are provided: an iSCSI target template, a management
   service template, and an abstract template to encapsulate the two.


5.1.  The iSCSI Abstract Service Type Template

   This template defines the abstract service "service:iscsi".  It is
   used as a top-level service to encapsulate all other iSCSI-related
   services.

     the iSCSI protocol.

   template-url-syntax=
     url-path=  ;  Depends on the concrete service type.

   --------------------------template ends here------------------------


5.2.  The iSCSI Target Concrete Service Type Template

   This template defines the service "service:iscsi:target".  An entity
   containing iSCSI targets that wishes them discovered via SLP would
   register each of them, with each of their addresses, as this service
   type.

   Initiators (and perhaps management services) wishing to discover
   targets in this way will generally use one of the following queries:

6.  Security Considerations

   The SLPv2 security model does not provide confidentiality, but does
   provide an authentication mechanism for UAs to assure that service
   advertisements only come from trusted SAs [RFC2608].

   Once a target or management server is discovered, authentication and
   authorization are handled by the iSCSI protocol, or by the management
   server's protocol.  It is the responsibility of the providers of
   these services to ensure that an inappropriately advertised or
   discovered service does not compromise their security.

Internet Draft                iSCSI and SLP                   March 2003


6.1.  Security Implementation

   For all implementations, IPsec SHOULD be implemented. When security
   policy information distribution using SLPv2 is supported, IPsec MUST
   be implemented.

   To provide confidentiality, IPsec with ESP and a non-null transform
   SHOULD be implemented. When security policy information distribution
   via SLPv2 is used, IPsec with ESP and a non-null transform MUST be
   used.

   SLPv2 authentication is OPTIONAL to implement and use, and SLPv2
   authentication SHOULD be implemented when IPsec is not supported.

   The use of IPsec and IKE for SLPv2 in an IP storage environment is
   described in [IPS-SEC].


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document describes three SLP Templates.  When they have been
   reviewed and approved by the IESG, they should be registered in the
   IANA "SVRLOC Templates" registry.  This process is described in the
   IANA Considerations section of [RFC2609].


8.  Summary

   This document describes how SLP can be used by iSCSI initiators to
   find iSCSI targets and storage management servers.  Service type
   templates for iSCSI targets and storage management servers are
   presented.
