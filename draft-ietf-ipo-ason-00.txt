1. Abstract 
    
   This draft describes an architecture for intelligent optical 
   networks. This architecture is called the automatic switched optical 
   networks (ASON). ASON is a client-server architecture with well-
   defined interfaces that allows clients to request services from the 
   optical network (server). ASON architecture and its generic 
   automatic switched transport networks (ASTN) has been an active 
   study area both at T1X1 and ITU [2,3]. 
    
   The protocols that run over ASON interfaces are not specified in 
   [2,3]. The emerging of IP-based protocols, e.g. generalized MPLS 
   [4], for the control of the optical layer makes it possible for the 
   ASON/ASTN architecture to benefit from the protocols design work 
   that has been progressing at the IETF.

3. Introduction 
    
   The existing transport networks provide SONET/SDH and WDM services 
   whose connections are provisioned via network management protocols. 
   This process is both slow (weeks to months) relative to the 
   switching speed and costly to the network providers. 
    
   An automatic switched optical network (ASON) is an optical/transport 
   network that has dynamic connection capability. It encompasses 
   SONET/SDH, wavelength, and potentially fiber connection services in 
   both OEO and all-optical networks. There are a number of added 
   values related to such a capability: 
    
   - Traffic engineering of optical channels: Where bandwidth 
     assignment is based on actual demand patterns. 
    
   - Mesh network topologies and restoration: Mesh network topologies 
     can in general be engineered for better utilization for a given 
     demand matrix. Ring topologies might not be as efficient due to 
     the asymmetry of traffic patterns. 
    
   - Managed bandwidth to core IP network connectivity: A switched 
     optical network can provide bandwidth and connectivity to an IP
     network in a dynamic manner compared to the relatively static 
     service available today. 
    
   - Introduction of new optical services: The availability of switched 
     optical networks will facilitate the introduction of new services 
     at the optical layer. Those services include bandwidth on demand 
     and optical virtual private networks (OVPN). 
    
   This draft describes the ASON architecture. ASON and its generic 
   ASTN has been a topic of active discussion both at the T1X1 and ITU. 
   The draft focuses on ASON control plane, its requirements, and 
   related protocols. The ASON architecture at the ITU is discussed in 
   two documents. The first document is G.807 (previously known as 
   G.astn)[3] describes network level, technology independent, 
   requirements for the control plane of ASTN. The second document is 
   G.ason [2], and it specifies architecture requirements for ASTN 
   network as applicable to SDH transport networks and optical 
   transport networks. 
    
4. ASON/ASTN Architecture: An Overview 
    
   ASON/ASTN architecture belongs to client-server models or the 
   overlay network models as defined in [6]. The salient feature of 
   this model is the existence of well-recognized boundaries between 
   client networks and provider domains. Client/provider separation is

   a direct recognition of today's networking realities where ownership 
   of layer 3 and layer 1 equipment belongs to different organizations. 
   This client/provider domain separation entails the running of 
   different routing instants at each domain. Thus there is no need to 
   share topology information between carriers and their clients. 
    
   The ASON/ASTN is an architecture that allows for global connectivity 
   as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 illustrates user end systems 
   connecting to a global ASTN/ASON network, which may be comprised of 
   multiple provider domains. As an overlay model there is no trusted 
   relationship between provider domains so the instantiated interfaces 
   are E-NNIs. Within a provider domain, the instantiated interface 
   between control plane entities is the I-NNI.

   As applied to optical networks, the ASON network interfaces are 
   further shown in Figure 2. In this Figure all the components that 
   can form part of ASON are shown. The architecture shown is intended 
   to allow switching of optical network connections within the optical 
   transport network under control of ASON signaling network.  
    
   There are three separate planes involved in the network:

   The transport plane contains the transport network elements 
   (switches and links) that carry the entity that is switched, i.e. 
   optical connections. End-to-end connections are setup within the 
   transport plane under the control of the ASON control plane (CP). 
   This draft is concerned with the CP part of the ASON architecture. 
   Both the TP and MP are out of the scope of this draft. 
    
5. ASON Control Plane: General Requirements 
    
   A well-designed control plane architecture should give service 
   providers better control of their network, while providing faster 
   and improved accuracy of circuit set-up. The control plane itself 
   should be reliable, scalable, and efficient.  It should also be 
   sufficiently generic to support different technologies and differing 
   business needs and different partitions of functions by vendors 
   (i.e., different packaging of the control plane components).  In 
   summary, the control plane architecture should:  
    
   - Be applicable to a variety of transport network technologies 
     (e.g., SONET/SDH, OTN, PXC).  In order to achieve this goal, it is 
     essential that the architecture isolates technology dependent 
     aspects from technology independent aspects, and address them 
     separately. 
    
   - Be sufficiently flexible to accommodate a range of different 
     network scenarios. This goal may be achieved by partitioning the 
     control plane into distinct components. This, allows vendors and 
     service providers to decide the location of these components, and 
     also allows the service provider to decide the security and policy 
     control of these components.

   The control plane shall support either switched connections (SC) of 
   soft permenant connections (SPC) of basic connection capability in 
   transport networks. These connection capabilities types are: 
    
   - Uni-directional point-to-point connection 
   - Bi-directional point-to-point connections 
   - Uni-directional point-to-multipoint connections 
    
   The components of the control plane architecture are illustrated in 
   Figure 3. This Figure illustrates the control plane functions and 
   their relationships. These entities can be packaged in different 
   ways, depending upon the required functionality.

   Directory service processes may be utilized by the control plane to 
   provide a mapping/translation of names and association of these 
   names between layer networks, sub-network domains (e.g., between 
   provider domains), and user name translations. This process includes 
   functions such as registration of a user within the ASON network 
   (including association of a user name to an ASON name space). 
 

5.1 Connection Controller Function (CC) 
    
   The role of this function within the control plane is: 
     
   - The management and supervision of connection set-ups; 
   - The management and supervision of connection releases;

Draft-ietf-ipo-ason-00.txt                                   July 2001 
 
 
   - The modification of connection parameters for existing 
     connections. 
    
   In response to a connection request the function must co-ordinate 
   the interrogation of the route table, requests to the call admission 
   control function, and updating the status of connection points. 
 

5.2 Route Table Function (RT) 
    
   The route table function consists of a list of reachable 
   destinations and for each destination a recommended egress link. The 
   role of the route table function is to respond to the request from 
   the connection controller for the egress link for a particular 
   destination.  
    
   Note that there are likely to be significant differences between I-
   NNI and E-NNI RT functions. Further, the reachability may also be a 
   function of the policy and routing constraints.  
    
5.3 Route Table Update Function (RTU) 
    
   Information stored in routing tables may be manually entered and 
   updated, as in the case of static routing. However, networks may 
   also automatically generate and maintain route tables and distribute 
   them throughout the network (at least within a domain). The role of 
   the route table update function is to: 
    
   - Relay the contents of a local route table for a sub-network to all 
     of its immediate neighbors; 
   - Receive the route tables from immediate neighboring sub-network 
     controllers and update local route table to reflect all of the 
     destinations it can reach via its neighbors. 
 

5.4 Connection Admission Control Function (CAC) 
    
   The role of this function is to decide if there is sufficient free 
   resource on a link to allow a new connection. If there is the call 
   admission control may allow a connection request to proceed. If it 
   is not allowed to proceed then the connection admission control 
   informs the connection controller to either find a new route or, 
   where none is available, notify the originator of the connection 
   request that the request has been refused. In principle there is a 
   connection admission control function associated with every resource 
   manager.  
    
   Connection admission control can also be decided based on 
   prioritization or on other policy decisions. CAC policies are 
   outside the scope of standardization. The connection admission 
   control interacts with: 
    
   - The connection controller from which it receives connection 
     requests;  
   - The link resource manager.

5.5 Link Resource Manager Function (LRM) 
    
   The role of this function is to keep track of the way link resources 
   are allocated to connections. The two primary resources that are 
   held by the link resource manager are capacity and connection 
   identifiers. The link resource manager records the capacity as seen 
   by the connection point group agent or access group agent and 
   controls the allocation of capacity to connections when requested as 
   part of the connection set-up process. The link resource manager 
   interacts with: 
    
   - The connection admission control function from which it receives 
     requests for link resources; 
   - The policing function for the setting and enforcement of policing 
     parameters for a connection; 
   - The connection controller that is informed by the link resource 
     manager that a connection has been admitted or released. 
    
   The behaviour of the link resource manager is dependent upon the 
   type of connection involved and the policies in force for 
   reservation and priority. As such the behaviour is technology 
   dependent. 
   In the case of circuit switching resource management is simple since 
   the allocation of capacity is automatic when a link connection is 
   connected to a connection. 
   The link resource manager function looks after label mappings and 
   variable capacity connections. 
 

5.6 Connection Point Status Function (CPS) 
    
   The role of this function is to provide the connection controller 
   with visibility of the status of all the connection points on the 
   boundary of the subnetwork.  The underlying CTP or TTP agents 
   provide the connection point status function. The status is the 
   state of the connection point as it proceeds through connection set-
   up and release. 
    
5.7 Policing Agent Function (PA) 
    
   The role of this function is to check that a connection is sending 
   traffic according to the parameters agreed at connection set-up or 
   as a result of a modification request. Where a connection violates 
   the agreed parameters then the policing agent may instigate measures 
   to correct the situation. Note: this is not needed for a CBR 
   transport layer network. PA relates to the incoming connection only. 
 

5.8 Protocol Controller Function (PC) 
    
   The role of the protocol controller is to provide reliable transfer 
   of control messages across the network by means of a defined 
   interface. This permits messages to be tracked and to ensure

   expected responses are received or that an exception is reported to 
   the originator. 
     
   Under normal circumstances signaling primitives are passed between 
   the connection controller and the protocol controller within a sub-
   network controller. The protocol controller is semantically 
   transparent to the messaging primitives as these result in external 
   protocol messages and vice versa. Signaling messages are passed 
   between protocol controllers in different sub-network controllers. 
   Protocol controllers are used to transfer the following information 
   Route table update messages via a route table update protocol 
   controller; 
    
   - Link resource manager messages (where appropriate as in available 
     bit rate connections) via a link resource manager protocol 
     controller; 
   - Connection control messages via a connection controller protocol 
     controller. 
 

   In addition, different protocol controllers may be implemented for 
   the following, I-NNI, E-NNI, and UNI. 
 

   In the case of a ôfabric controllerö there is an additional 
   interface, the CCI, between the underlying fabric and the 
   controller. This, in a single network element, is not subject to 
   standardization.  
 
6. ASON Control Plane: External Interfaces and Protocols 
    
   The ASON CP as shown in Figure 2 defines a set of interfaces: 
    
   - User-Network Interface (UNI): UNI runs between the optical client 
     and the network.  
    
   - Internal Node-to-Node Interface (I-NNI): I-NNI defines the 
     interface between the signaling network elements, i.e. OCC within 
     the switched optical network. 
    
   - External Node-to-Node Interface (E-NNI): E-NNI defines the 
     interface between ASON control planes in different administration 
     domains. 
    
   - Connection Control Interface (CCI): The CCI defines the interface 
     between ASON signaling element, i.e. OCC and the transport network 
     element, i.e. the cross connect. 
    
   The different ASON interfaces are described in the next few 
   sections. Candidate protocols for use at the different interfaces 
   are also discussed.

   ASON UNI allows ASON client to perform a number of functions 
   including: 
    
   - Connection Create: Allows the clients to signal to the network to 
     create a new connection with specified attributes. Those 
     attributes might include bandwidth, protection, restoration, and 
     diversity. 
    
   - Connection Delete: Allows ASON clients to signal to the network 
     the need to delete an already existing connection. 
    
   - Connection Modify: Allows ASON clients to signal to the network 
     the need to modify one or more attribute for an already existing 
     connection. 
    
   - Status Enquiry: Allows ASON clients to enquire the status of an 
     already existing connection. 
    
   Other functions that might be performed at the ASON UNI are, client 
   registration, address resolution, neighbor and service discovery. 
   Those functions could be automated or manually configured between 
   the network and its clients. 
    
   Client registration and address resolution are tightly coupled to 
   the optical network address scheme. Requirements for optical network 
   addresses and client names are outlined in [7]. In general the 
   client name (or identification) domain and optical address domain 
   are decoupled. The client id should be globally unique to allow for 
   the establishment of end-to-end connections that encompass multiple 
   administration domains. For security, it is required that the nodal 
   addresses used for routing within an optical domain do not cross 
   network boundaries. The notion of closed user groups should also be 
   included in ASON addressing to allow for the offering of OVPN 
   services. 
    
   Address registration and resolution usually involves some kind of a 
   directory service. The client uses the registration process to 
   register his identification with the provider network for a 
   particular user group or groups. Address resolution involves the 
   process of translating client names to network addresses. Address 
   resolution can be performed at clients, edge network element, or at 
   every administrative boundary entry. It could involves 
   authentication and policy look up to make sure that a client has the 
   necessary credentials to join a user group. 
    
   ASON UNI realization requires the implementation of a signaling 
   protocol with sufficient capabilities to satisfy UNI functions. Both 
   LDP [8] and RSVP-TE [9] have been extended to be used the signaling 
   protocol across the ASON UNI. The extensions involve the definition 
   of the necessary TLVs or objects to be used for signaling connection 
   attributes specific to the optical layer. New messages are also 
   defined to allow for connection status enquiry. The Optical

   Internetworking Forum (OIF) has adopted both protocols in its UNI 
   1.0 specifications [10]. 
    
6.2 ASON Internal Node-to-Node Interface 
    
   The I-NNI defines the interface between adjacent optical connection 
   controls (OCC) in the same network. There are two main aspects of I-
   NNI. Those are signaling and routing. 
 
   Path selection and setup through the optical network requires a 
   signaling protocol. Transport networks typically utilize explicit 
   routing, where path selection can be done either by operator or 
   software scheduling tools in management systems. IN ASON, end-to-end 
   optical channels (connections) are requested with certain 
   constraints. Path selection for a connection request should employ 
   constrained routing algorithms that balance multiple objectives: 
    
   - Conform to constraints such as physical diversity, etc. 
    
   - Load balancing of network traffic to achieve the best utilization 
     of network resources. 
    
   - Follow policy decisions on routing such as preferred routes. 
    
   To facilitate the automation of the optical connection setup, nodes 
   in the optical network must have an updated view of its adjacencies 
   and of the utilization levels at the various links of the network. 
   This updated view is sometime referred to as state information. 
    
   State information dissemination is defined as the manner in which 
   local physical resource information is disseminated throughout the 
   network. First the local physical resource map is summarized into 
   logical link information according to link attributes. This 
   information can then be distributed to the different nodes in the 
   network using the control plane transport network IGP.  
    
   ASON I-NNI could be based on two key protocols, IP and MPLS. Since 
   MPLS employs the principle of separation between the control and the 
   forward planes, its extension to support I-NNI signaling is 
   feasible. Generalized MPLS [4] defines MPLS extensions to suit types 
   of label switching other than the in-packet label. Those other types 
   include, time slot switching, wavelength and waveband switching, and 
   position switching between fibers. Both CR-LDP [11] and RSVP-TE [12] 
   have been extended to allow for the request and the binding of 
   generalized labels. With generalized MPLS, a label switched path 
   (LSP) is established with the appropriate encoding type (e.g. SONET, 
   wavelength, etc.). LSP establishment takes into account specific 
   characteristics that belong to a particular technology.  
    
   MPLS traffic engineering requires the availability of routing 
   protocols that are capable of summarizing link state information in 
   their databases. Extensions to IP routing protocols, OSPF and IS-IS,

   in support of link state information for generalized MPLS are 
   described in [13, 14]. 
    
6.3 ASON External Node-to-Node Interface 
    
   E-NNI is an inter-domain interface for use between ASON networks 
   that are under different network administrations. It is similar to 
   the UNI interface with some routing functions to allow for the 
   exchange of reachability information between different domains. BGP 
   is an IP based protocol that could be used to summarize reachability 
   information between different ASON domains in the same manner as it 
   has been in use today for IP networks. 
 
6.4 ASON Connection Control Interface 
 
   CCI defines the interface between the ASON signaling element (OCC) 
   and the transport network elements. Connection control information 
   is passed over this interface to establish connections between the 
   ports of the optical transport switch. The CCI is included as part 
   of ASON control plane because it enables switches of various 
   capacities and internal complexities to be part of an ASON node. 
    
   The protocol running across the CCI must support two essential 
   functions: 
    
   - Adding and deletion of connections. 
    
   - Query of port status of the switch. 
    
   General Switch Management Protocol (GSMP) [15] fits CCI 
   requirements. GSMP is a general-purpose protocol that allows a 
   controller to establish and release connections across a switch. 
   GSMP is well suited for network architectures that employs label 
   swapping in the forwarding plane, e.g. ATM, FR, and MPLS. This 
   property makes GSMP a good fit for generalized label as defined by 
   generalized MPLS. GSMP extensions for generalized MPLS are yet to be 
   worked out. 
    
7. ASON/ASTN CP Transport Network (signaling Network) 
    
   In this section, we detail some architectural considerations for the 
   makeup of the transport network that is used to transport the 
   control plane information.  For circuit-based networks, the ability 
   to have an independent transport network for message transportation 
   is an important requirement. 
    
   The control network represents the transport infrastructure for 
   control traffic, and can be either in-band or out-of-band. An 
   implication of this is that the control plane may be supported by a 
   different physical topology from that of the underlying ASON. There 
   are fundamental requirements that control networks must satisfy in 
   order to assure that control plane data can be transported in a 
   reliable and efficient manner. In the event of control plane failure

   (for example, communications channel or control entity failure), 
   while new connection operations will not be accepted, existing 
   connections will not be dropped. Control network failure would still 
   allow dissemination of the failure event to a management system for 
   maintenance purposes. This implies a need for separate notifications 
   and status codes for the control plane and ASON. Additional 
   procedures may also be required for control plane failure recovery. 
    
   It is recognized that the inter-working of the control networks is 
   the first step towards control plane inter-working. To maintain a 
   certain level of ease, it's desirable to have a common control 
   network for different domains/sub-networks or types of network. 
    
   Typically, control plane and transport functions may co-exist in a 
   network element. However, this may not be true in the case of a 
   third party control. This situation needs further study.   
   Furthermore, addressing issues in the control plane vis-€-vis the 
   transport network is also for further study. 
    
   ASON CP transport network requirements includes: 
    
   - Control plane message transport should be secure. This requirement 
     stems from the fact that the information exchanged over the 
     control plane is service-provider specific and security is of 
     utmost importance.  
    
   - Control message transport reliability has to be guaranteed in 
     almost all situations, even during what might be considered 
     catastrophic failure scenarios of the controlled network. 
    
   - The control traffic transport performance affects connection 
     management performance.  Connection service performance largely 
     depends on its message transport. Time sensitive operations, such 
     as protection switching, may need certain QoS guarantees. 
     Furthermore, a certain level of survivability of the message 
     transport should be provided in case of control network failure. 
    
   - The control network needs to be both upward and downward scalable 
     in order for the control plane to be scalable. Downward 
     scalability may be envisioned where the ASON network offers 
     significant static connections, reducing the need for an extended 
     control network.  
    
   - The control plane protocols shall not assume that the signaling 
     network topology is identical to that of the transport network. 
     The control plane protocols MUST operate over a variety of 
     signaling network topologies. 
    
   Given the above requirements, it is critical that the maintenance of 
   the control network itself not pose a problem to service providers. 
   As a corollary this means that configuration-intensive operations 
   should be avoided for the control network.

   Common channel signaling links are associated with user channels in 
   the following ways: 
    
   - Associated, whereby signaling messages related to traffic between 
     two network elements are transferred over signalling links that 
     directly connect the two network elements 
   - Non-associated, whereby signaling messages between two network 
     elements A and B are routed over several signalling links, whilst 
     traffic signals are routed directly between A and B.  The 
     signalling links used may vary with time and network conditions  
   - Quasi-associated, whereby signaling messages between nodes A and B 
     follow a predetermined routeing path over several signalling links 
     whilst the traffic channels are routed directly between A and B. 
    
   Associated signaling may be used where the number of traffic channels 
   between two network elements is large, thereby allowing a single 
   signaling channel to be shared amongst a large number of traffic 
   channels. 
    
   Quasi-associated signaling may be used to improve resiliency. For 
   example consider a signaling channel that has failure mechanisms 
   independent of the traffic channels. Failure of the signaling channel 
   will result in loss of signaling capability for all traffic channels 
   even if all the traffic channels are still functional. Quasi-
   associated signaling mitigates against this by employing alternative 
   signaling routes. In other words the signaling network must be 
   designed such that failure of a signaling link shall not affect the 
   traffic channels associated with that signaling channel.  
    
8. Transport Network Survivability 
    
   In a transport network, survivability can be controlled by the 
   ASON/ASTN control plane or by transport network mechanisms that are 
   independent of the control plane. Survivability can be achieved 
   either by means of protection, which requires dedicated capacity, or 
   restoration which uses available spare capacity. Specific 
   survivability mechanisms such as protection schemes or fast 
   restoration schemes are beyond the scope of this recommendation. 
    
   Soft permanent connections are set-up/torn down in response to 
   requests initiated by the network management system. As such it is 
   possible to determine survivability routings using operational 
   support systems, with explicit path information relayed to the 
   control plane or by the control plane itself. 
    
   In the case of switched connections, survivability and routing are 
   determined by the control plane. 
    
   User requests for explicit survivability mechanisms (e.g. requests 
   for 1:1, 1+1, ring, mesh protection etc.) are not supported, as the 
   user should not have access to the topology of the provider network 
   and in some instances the connection may require different protection 
   mechanisms for different parts of the connection. However, the user

   may request from the provider diverse connections (i.e. with no 
   common routing). 
    
   To provide diverse routing it is necessary to have access to 
   information relating to the topology of the layer network in which 
   the soft permanent connection or switched connection resides and all 
   of the server layer networks including the fiber, cable and duct 
   (also known as conduit). Full diversity also requires knowledge of 
   the relationship between buildings/locations and transmission 
   facilities. Mechanisms to support diverse routing, for those carriers 
   wishing to support this functionality, may be provided by either the 
   management plane, for soft permanent connections, or the control 
   plane for either soft permanent connections or switched connections. 
    
10. Relationship to GMPLS Architecture 
    
   The relationship between ASON/ASTN control plane architecture and 
   GMPLS-based protocols is established in section 6, where it has been 
   shown how the different GMPLS protocol could be used for the 
   realization of the different ASON/ASTN external interfaces.  
    
   Recently, a GMPLS architecture [16] has been introduced. It is 
   important to note that there is no real conflict between GMPLS 
   architecture and the network architecture presented in this draft. 
   ASON/ASTN provides a functional architecture of a control plane that 
   allows the establishment of switched paths in optical networks. It 
   provides the set of external interfaces that are necessary for the 
   ASTN/ASON network to have a global reach. It does that, however, in a 
   protocol independent fashion that can be realized in a different ways 
   provided that its requirements are satisfied. 
    
   The GMPLS architecture focuses more on the applications of GMPLS-
   defined protocols, e.g. CR-LDP for the setup of generalized LSP 
   (GLSP) at the different interfaces of the network, e.g. I-NNI, UNI, 
   etc. It does that in a more comprehensible way than what is described 
   in section 6 of this draft.

   This draft does not introduce any unknown security issues.
