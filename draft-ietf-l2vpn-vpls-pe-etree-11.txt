   Ethernet-Tree (E-Tree) Support in Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)
                  draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpls-pe-etree-11.txt


Abstract

   This document specifies a generic Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)
   solution which uses VLANs to indicate root or leaf traffic to
   support Ethernet-Tree (E-Tree) services. A VPLS Provider Edge (PE)
   model is illustrated as an example for the solution. In the solution,
   E-Tree VPLS PEs are interconnected by Pseudo Wires (PWs) which carry
   the VLAN indicating the E-Tree attribute. The MAC address-based
   Ethernet forwarding engine and the PW work in the same way as
   specified in RFC 4762 and RFC 4448 respectively. A signaling
   mechanism is described to support E-Tree capability and VLAN mapping
   negotiation.

   VPLS: Virtual Private LAN Service

   VSI: Virtual Switching Instance as defined in [RFC4664], also known

3. Introduction

   The Ethernet-Tree (E-Tree) service is defined in Metro Ethernet
   Forum (MEF) Technical Specification MEF 6.2 [MEF6.2] as a Rooted-
   Multipoint Ethernet Virtual Connection (EVC) service. An MEF 6.2 E-
   Tree solution must meet the following design requirements: the
   Ethernet frames from a root may be received by any other root or
   leaf, and the frames from a leaf may be received by any root, but
   must not be received by a leaf. Further, an E-Tree service may
   include multiple roots and multiple leaves. Although Virtual Private
   Multicast Service (VPMS) [VPMS] or Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP)
   multicast is a somewhat simplified version of this service, in fact,
   they are both multicast services and are different from an E-Tree
   service which may include both unicast and multicast traffic.

   [RFC7152] gives the requirements for providing E-Tree solutions in
   the VPLS and the need to filter leaf-to-leaf traffic. [RFC7387]
   further describes a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) framework
   for providing E-Tree. Though there were proposals on using the
   Pseudowire (PW) control word or PWs to indicate the root/leaf
   attribute of an E-Tree frame, both methods are limited in that they
   are only applicable to "VPLS only" networks.

   A VPLS PE usually consists of a bridge module itself (see [RFC4664]
   and [RFC6246]); and moreover, E-Tree services may cross both
   Ethernet and VPLS domains. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an
   E-Tree solution both for "VPLS only" scenarios and for interworking
   between Ethernet and VPLS.

   IEEE 802.1 has incorporated the generic E-Tree solution into 802.1Q
   [802.1Q-2014], which is an improvement on the traditional asymmetric
   VLAN mechanism. In the asymmetric VLAN mechanism as described in
   Section B.1.3 of IEEE 802.1Q-2003 [802.1Q-2003], a VLAN ID is used
   to indicate the traffic from a server, and multiple VLAN IDs are
   used to indicate the traffic from the clients (one VLAN ID per
   client). In the new IEEE 802.1Q solution, only two VLANs are used to
   indicate root/leaf attributes of a frame: one VLAN ID is used to
   indicate the frames originated from the roots and another VLAN ID is
   used to indicate the frames originated from the leaves. At a leaf
   port, the bridge can then filter out all the frames from other leaf
   ports based on the VLAN ID. It is better to reuse the same mechanism
   in VPLS than to develop a new mechanism. A new mechanism would

   introduce more complexity to interwork with the new IEEE 802.1Q
   solution.

   This document specifies how the Ethernet VLAN solution can be used
   to support generic E-Tree services in VPLS. The solution specified
   here is fully compatible with the IEEE bridge architecture and with
   IETF Pseudo Wire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) technology, thus it
   will not change the FIB (such as installing E-Tree attributes in the
   FIB), or need any specially tailored implementation. Furthermore,
   VPLS scalability and simplicity are also maintained. With this
   mechanism, it is also convenient to deploy a converged E-Tree
   service across both Ethernet and MPLS networks.

   A typical VPLS PE model is introduced as an example; the model is
   then extended in which a Tree VSI is connected to a VLAN bridge with
   a dual-VLAN interface.

   The document then discusses the PW encapsulation and PW processing
   such as VLAN mapping options for transporting E-Tree services in
   VPLS.

   Finally, the document describes the signaling extensions and
   processing procedures for E-Tree support in VPLS.



4. PE Model with E-Tree Support

   The problem scenario of E-Tree as shown in Fig. 1 of [RFC7152] is a
   simplification of the L2VPN architecture, several common VPLS PE
   architectures are discussed in more details in [RFC4664] and
   [RFC6246].

   Below, an E-Tree solution in VPLS is demonstrated with the help of a
   typical VPLS PE model. Its use in other PE models is discussed in
   Appendix A.

4.1. Existing PE Models

   According to [RFC4664], there are at least three models possible for
   a VPLS PE, including:

   o A single bridge module, a single VSI;

   o A single bridge module, multiple VSIs;

   o Multiple bridge modules, each attaches to a VSI.

Internet-Draft         E-Tree Support in VPLS            December 2015

   The second PE model is commonly used. A typical example is further
   depicted in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 (both figures are extracted from
   [RFC6246]), where an S-VLAN bridge module is connected to multiple
   VSIs each with a single VLAN virtual interface.

   In this PE model, Ethernet frames from Customer Edges (CEs) will
   cross multiple stages of bridge modules (i.e., C-VLAN and S-VLAN
   bridge) and a VSI in a PE before being sent on the PW to a remote PE.
   Therefore, the association between an AC port and a PW on a VSI is
   difficult.

   This model could be further enhanced: When Ethernet frames arrive at
   an ingress PE, a root VLAN or a leaf VLAN tag is added. At an egress
   PE, the frames with the root VLAN tag are transmitted both to the
   roots and the leaves, while the frames with the leaf VLAN tag are
   transmitted to the roots but dropped for the leaves (these VLAN tags
   are removed before the frames are transmitted over the ACs). It was
   demonstrated in [802.1Q-2014] that the E-Tree service in Ethernet
   networks can be well supported with this mechanism.

   Assuming this mechanism is implemented in the bridge module, it is
   quite straightforward to infer a VPLS PE model with two VSIs to
   support the E-Tree (as shown in Fig. 3). But this model will require
   two VSIs per PE and two sets of PWs per E-Tree service, which is
   poorly scalable in a large MPLS/VPLS network; in addition, both
   these VSIs have to share their learned MAC addresses.

4.2. A New PE Model with E-Tree Support

   In order to support the E-Tree in a more scalable way, a new VPLS PE
   model with a single Tree VSI (T-VSI, a VSI with E-Tree support) is
   specified. As depicted in Fig. 4, the bridge module is connected to
   the T-VSI with a dual-VLAN virtual interface, i.e., both the root
   VLAN and the leaf VLAN are connected to the same T-VSI, and they
   share the same FIB and work in shared VLAN learning. In this way,
   only one VPLS instance and one set of PWs is needed per E-Tree
   service, and the scalability of VPLS is improved.

   For an untagged AC port (frames over this port are untagged) or
   VLAN-unaware port (VLAN tags in the frames are ignored), and the
   bridge module is a C-VLAN bridge, the Ethernet frames received from
   the root ACs MUST be tagged with a root C-VLAN. When the bridge
   module is an 802.1ad bridge, the Ethernet frames received from the
   root ACs MUST be tagged with a root S-VLAN. Note, this can be done
   by adding a root C-VLAN first in a C-VLAN bridge but this is out of
   the scope of this document.

   For a C-VLAN tagged port, the Ethernet frames received from the root
   ACs MUST be tagged with a root S-VLAN.

Internet-Draft         E-Tree Support in VPLS            December 2015

   For an S-VLAN tagged port, the S-VLAN tag in the Ethernet frames
   received from the root ACs SHOULD be translated to the root S-VLAN
   in the VPLS network domain.

   Alternatively, for an S-VLAN tagged port, the PBB VPLS PE model
   (where an IEEE 802.1ah bridge module is embedded in the PE) as
   described in [RFC7041] MAY be used. A root B-VLAN or leaf B-VLAN MAY
   be added. The E-Tree attribute may also be indicated with two I-SID
   tags in the bridge module, and the frames are then encapsulated and
   transported transparently over a single B-VLAN. Thus the PBB VPLS
   works in the same way as described in [RFC7041] and will not be
   discussed further in this document. When many S-VLANs are
   multiplexed in a single AC, PBB VPLS has the advantages of both VLAN
   scalability and MAC address scalability.

   In a similar way, the traffic from the leaf ACs is tagged and
   transported on the leaf C-VLAN, S-VLAN or B-VLAN.

   In all cases, the outermost VLAN in the resulting Ethernet header is
   used to indicate the E-Tree attribute of an Ethernet frame; this
   document uses VLAN to refer to this outermost VLAN for simplicity in
   the latter sections.



5. PW for E-Tree Support

5.1. PW Encapsulation

   To support an E-Tree service, T-VSIs in a VPLS MUST be
   interconnected with a bidirectional Ethernet PW. The Ethernet PW
   SHOULD work in the tagged mode (PW type 0x0004) as described in
   [RFC4448], in which case a VLAN tag MUST be carried in each frame in
   the PW to indicate the frame originated from either root or leaf
   (the VLAN tag indicating the frame originated from either root or
   leaf can be translated by a bridge module in the PE or added by an
   outside Ethernet edge device, even by a customer device). In the
   tagged PW mode, two service delimiting VLANs MUST be allocated in
   the VPLS domain for an E-Tree. PW processing for the tagged PW will
   be described in Section 5.3 of this document.

   A raw mode PW (PW type 0x0005 in [RFC4448]) MAY also be used to
   carry E-Tree service for a PW in Compatible mode as shown in Section
   5.3.2. As defined in [RFC4448], for a raw mode PW, an Ethernet
   frame's 802.1Q VLAN tag is not meaningful to the PEs and it passes
   transparently through them.

5.2. VLAN Mapping

   There are two ways of manipulating VLANs for an E-Tree in VPLS:

   o Global VLAN based, that is, provisioning two global VLANs (Root
      VLAN, Leaf VLAN) across the VPLS network, thus no VLAN mapping is
      needed at all, or the VLAN mapping is done completely in the
      Ethernet domains.

   o Local VLAN based, that is, provisioning two local VLANs for each
      PE (which participates in the E-Tree) in the VPLS network
      independently.

   The first method requires no VLAN mapping in the PW, but two unique
   service delimiting VLANs must be allocated across the VPLS domain.

   The second method is more scalable in the use of VLANs, but needs a
   VLAN mapping mechanism in the PW similar to what is already
   described in Section 4.3 of [RFC4448].

   Global or local VLANs can be manually configured or provisioned by
   an Operational Support System. Alternatively, some automatic VLAN
   allocation algorithm may be provided in the management plane, but it
   is out of scope of this document.

   For both methods, VLAN mapping parameters from a remote PE can be
   provisioned or determined by a signaling protocol as described in
   Section 6 when a PW is being established.

5.3. PW Processing

5.3.1. PW Processing in the VLAN Mapping Mode

   In the VLAN Mapping mode, two VPLS PEs with E-Tree capability are
   inter-connected with a PW (For example, the scenario of Fig. 5
   depicts the interconnection of two PEs attached with both root and
   leaf nodes).

             Figure 5 T-VSI Interconnected in the Normal Mode

   If a PE is in the VLAN mapping mode for a PW, then in the data plane
   the PE MUST map the VLAN in each frame as follows:

    o Upon transmitting frames on the PW, map from local VLAN to remote
    VLAN (i.e., the local leaf VLAN in a frame is translated to the
    remote leaf VLAN; the local root VLAN in a frame is translated to
    the remote root VLAN).

    o Upon receiving frames on the PW, map from remote VLAN to local
    VLAN, and the frames are further forwarded or dropped in the egress
    bridge module using the filtering mechanism as described in [802.1Q-
    2014].

    The signaling for VLANs used by E-Tree is specified in Section 6.

5.3.2. PW Processing in the Compatible Mode

   The new VPLS PE model can work in a traditional VPLS network
   seamlessly in the compatibility mode. As shown in Fig. 6, the VPLS
   PE with T-VSI can be attached with root and/or leaf nodes, while the
   VPLS PE with a traditional VSI can only be attached with root nodes.
   A raw PW SHOULD be used to connect them.

   If a PE is in the Compatible mode for a PW, then in the data plane
   the PE MUST process the frame as follows:

    o Upon transmitting frames on the PW, remove the root or leaf VLAN
    in the frames.

    o Upon receiving frames on the PW, add a VLAN tag with a value of
    the local root VLAN to the frames.

5.3.3. PW Processing in the Optimized Mode

   When two PEs (both have E-Tree capability) are inter-connected with
   a PW and one of them (e.g., PE2) is attached with only leaf nodes,
   as shown in the scenario of Fig. 7, its peer PE (e.g., PE1) should
   then work in the optimized mode for this PW. In this case, PE1
   should not send the frames originated from the local leaf VLAN to
   PE2, i.e., these frames are dropped rather than transported over the
   PW. The bandwidth efficiency of the VPLS can thus be improved. The
   signaling for the PE attached with only leaf nodes is specified in
   Section 6.

6. Signaling for E-Tree Support

6.1. LDP Extensions for E-Tree Support

   In addition to the signaling procedures as specified in Section
   5.3.3 of [RFC4447], this document specifies a new interface
   parameter sub-TLV to provision an E-Tree service and negotiate the
   VLAN mapping function, as follows:

     0                   1                   2                   3

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                         Figure 8  E-Tree Sub-TLV

   Where:

   o E-Tree is the sub-TLV identifier (0x1A) as assigned by IANA.

   o Length is the length of the sub TLV in octets.

   o Reserved, bits MUST be set to zero on transmit and be ignored on
      receive.

   o P is a Leaf-only bit, it is set to 1 to indicate that the PE is
      attached with only leaf nodes, and set to 0 otherwise.

   o V is a bit indicating the sender's VLAN mapping capability. A PE
      capable of VLAN mapping MUST set this bit, and clear it otherwise.

   o MBZ, Must Be Zero, 4 bits MUST be set to zero on transmit and be
      ignored on receive.

   o Root VLAN ID is the value of the local root VLAN.

   o Leaf VLAN ID is the value of the local leaf VLAN.

   When setting up a PW for the E-Tree based VPLS, two peer PEs
   negotiate the E-Tree support using the above E-Tree sub-TLV. Note PW
   type of 0x0004 SHOULD be used during the PW negotiation.

   A PE that wishes to support E-Tree service MUST include an E-Tree
   Sub-TLV in its PW label mapping message and include its local root
   VLAN ID and leaf VLAN ID in the TLV.  A PE that has the VLAN mapping

   capability MUST set the V bit to 1, and a PE attached with only leaf
   nodes SHOULD set the P bit to 1.

   A PE that receives a PW label mapping message with an E-Tree Sub-TLV
   from its peer PE, after saving the VLAN information for the PW, MUST
   process it as follows:

   1) For this PW, set VLAN-Mapping-Mode, Compatible-Mode, and
      Optimized-Mode to FALSE.

   2) If either the root VLAN ID in the message is not equal to the
      local root VLAN ID or the leaf VLAN ID in the message is not equal
      to the local leaf VLAN ID {

          If the bit V is cleared {

                If the PE is capable of VLAN mapping, it MUST set VLAN-
                Mapping-Mode to TRUE;

                Else {

                     A label release message with the error code "E-
                     Tree VLAN mapping not supported" is sent to the
                     peer PE and exit the process;

                     }

          }

          If the bit V is set, and the PE is capable of VLAN mapping,
          the PE with the minimum IP address MUST set VLAN-Mapping-Mode
          to TRUE;

      }

   3) If the P bit is set

      {

          If the PE is a leaf-only node itself, a label release message
      with a status code "Leaf to Leaf PW released" is sent to the peer
      PE and exit the process;

          Else the PE SHOULD set the Optimized-Mode to TRUE.

      }

Internet-Draft         E-Tree Support in VPLS            December 2015

   A PE SHOULD send a Label Mapping message with an E-Tree Sub-TLV as
   per Section 5.3.3 of [RFC4447]. A PE MUST send a Label Mapping
   message with an updated E-Tree Sub-TLV to all other PEs over
   corresponding LDP sessions when its role changes from leaf-only to
   not leaf-only (i.e., when a root node is added to a PE attached with
   only leaf nodes).

   If a PE has sent a Label Mapping message with an E-Tree Sub-TLV but
   does not receive any E-Tree Sub-TLV in its peer's PW label mapping
   message, The PE SHOULD then establish a raw PW with this peer as in
   traditional VPLS and set Compatible-Mode to TRUE for this PW.

   Data plane processing for this PW is as following:

   If Optimized-Mode is TRUE, then data plane processing as described
   in Section 5.3.3 applies.

   If VLAN-Mapping-Mode is TRUE, then data plane processing as
   described in Section 5.3.1 applies.

   If Compatible-Mode is TRUE, then data plane processing is as
   described in Section 5.3.2.

   PW processing as described in [RFC4448] proceeds as usual for all
   cases.

   When VPLS is set up using Pseudowire ID (PWid) Forwarding
   Equivalence Class (FEC) Element (see Appendix A of [RFC4762]), its
   E-Tree signaling is similar to the above process. Dynamic re-
   configuration of E-Tree should be avoided for this case, however,
   when re-configuration of E-Tree is forced on a PE for some reason
   (e.g., a configuration error), the PE may close the LDP sessions
   with its peer PEs for this VPLS instance, and re-install its PW
   labels, so that its peer PEs can send out the LDP label mapping
   messages again.

6.2. BGP Extensions for E-Tree Support

   o Reserved, 14 bits MUST be set to zero on transmit and be ignored
      on receive.

   o P is a Leaf-only bit, it is set to 1 to indicate that the PE is
      attached with only leaf nodes, and set to 0 otherwise.

   o V is a bit indicating the sender's VLAN mapping capability. A PE
      capable of VLAN mapping MUST set this bit, and clear it otherwise.

   The PEs attached with both leaf and root nodes MUST support BGP E-
   Tree signaling as described in this document, and SHOULD support
   VLAN mapping in their data planes. The traditional PE attached with
   only root nodes may also participate in an E-Tree service. If some
   PEs don't support VLAN mapping, global VLANs as per Section 5.2 MUST
   be provisioned for an E-Tree service.

   In BGP VPLS signaling, besides attaching a Layer2 Info Extended
   Community as detailed in [RFC4761], an E-Tree Extended Community
   MUST be further attached if a PE wishes to participate in an E-Tree
   service. The PE MUST include its local root VLAN ID and leaf VLAN ID
   in the E-Tree Extended Community. A PE attached with only leaf nodes
   of an E-Tree SHOULD set the P bit in the E-Tree Extended Community
   to 1.

          Else the PE SHOULD set the Optimized-Mode to TRUE.

      }

   A PE which does not recognize this attribute SHALL ignore it
   silently. If a PE has sent an E-Tree Extended Community but does not
   receive any E-Tree Extended Community from its peer, the PE SHOULD

   set Compatible-Mode to TRUE for this PW.

   described at the end of Section 6.1 in this document.

7. OAM Considerations

   VPLS OAM requirements and framework as specified in [RFC6136] are
   applicable to E-Tree, as both Ethernet OAM frames and data traffic
   are transported over the same PW.

   Ethernet OAM for E-Tree including both service OAM and segment OAM
   frames SHALL undergo the same VLAN mapping as the data traffic; and
   root VLAN SHOULD be applied to segment OAM frames so that they are
   not filtered.

8. Applicability

   The solution specified in this document is applicable to both LDP
   VPLS [RFC4762] and BGP VPLS [RFC4761].

   This solution is applicable to both "VPLS Only" networks and VPLS
   with Ethernet aggregation networks.

   This solution is also applicable to PBB VPLS networks.

9. Security Considerations

   This solution requires implementations to prevent leaf to leaf
   communication in the data plane of VPLS when its PEs are
   interconnected with PWs. If all PEs enforce that then network
   attacks from one leaf to another leaf are avoided, and security can
   be enhanced for customers with this solution. However, if a PE is
   compromised or inappropriately configured, a leaf node may be taken
   as a root node and may receive traffic from other leaf nodes
   inappropriately. Authenticity and integrity measures for LDP need to
   be considered as in RFC 5036 [RFC5036]. Security considerations as
   described in [RFC4448], [RFC4761] and [RFC4762] also apply.



10.  IANA Considerations

   IANA allocated a value for E-Tree in the registry of Pseudowire
   Interface Parameters Sub-TLV type.

Appendix A. Other PE Models for E-Tree

A.1. A PE Model With a VSI and No bridge

   If there is no bridge module in a PE, the PE may consist of Native
   Service Processors (NSPs) as shown in Figure A.1 (adapted from Fig.
   5 of [RFC3985]) where any transformation operation for VLANs (e.g.,
   VLAN insertion/removal or VLAN mapping) may be applied. Thus a root
   VLAN or leaf VLAN can be added by the NSP depending on the User
   Network Interface (UNI) type (root/leaf) associated with the AC over
   which the packet arrives.

   Further, when a packet with a leaf VLAN exits a forwarder and
   arrives at the NSP, the NSP must drop the packet if the egress AC is
   associated with a leaf UNI.

   Tagged PW and VLAN mapping work in the same way as in the typical PE
   model.

        Figure A.1  A PE model with a VSI and no bridge module

   This PE model may be used by a Multi-Tenant Unit switch (MTU-s) in a
   Hierarchical VPLS (H-VPLS) network, or a Network-facing PE (N-PE) in
   an H-VPLS network with non-bridging edge devices, wherein a spoke PW
   can be treated as an AC in this model.

         Figure A.2  A PE model with external E-Tree interface

   A more simplified PE model is depicted in A.2, where Root/Leaf VLANs
   are directly or indirectly over a single PW connected to a same VSI
   forwarder in a PE, any transformation of E-Tree VLANs, e.g., VLAN
   insertion/removal or VLAN mapping, can be performed by some outer
   equipments, and the PE may further translate these VLANs into its
   own local VLANs. This PE model may be used by an N-PE in an H-VPLS
   network with bridging-capable devices, or scenarios such as
   providing E-Tree Network-to-Network interfaces.
