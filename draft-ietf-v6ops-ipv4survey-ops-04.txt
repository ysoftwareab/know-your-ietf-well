           Survey of IPv4 Addresses in Currently Deployed 
             IETF Operations & Management Area Standards

This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance with
all provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026.

Status of this Memo

Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups.  Note that other
groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-Drafts.

Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six
months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at
any time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

Abstract

This document seeks to document all usage of IPv4 addresses in currently
deployed IETF Operations & Management Area documented standards.  In 
order to successfully transition from an all IPv4 Internet to an all 
IPv6 Internet, many interim steps will be taken. One of these steps is 
the evolution of current protocols that have IPv4 dependencies.  It is 
hoped that these protocols (and their implementations) will be 
redesigned to be network address independent, but failing that will at 
least dually support IPv4 and IPv6.  To this end, all Standards (Full, 
Draft, and Proposed) as well as Experimental RFCs will be surveyed and 
any dependencies will be documented.

1.0 Introduction

This document is part of a document set aiming to document all usage of
IPv4 addresses in IETF standards. In an effort to have the information 
in a manageable form, it has been broken into 7 documents conforming 
to the current IETF areas (Application,  Internet, Management & 
Operations, Routing, Security, Sub-IP and Transport).

For a full introduction, please see the introduction [1].

2.0 Document Organization

The document is organized as described below:

Sections 3, 4, 5, and 6 each describe the raw analysis of Full, Draft,
and Proposed Standards, and Experimental RFCs.  Each RFC is discussed in
its turn starting with RFC 1 and ending with (around) RFC 3100.  
The comments for each RFC are "raw" in nature.  That is, each RFC is 
discussed in a vacuum  and problems or issues discussed do not 
"look ahead" to see if the  problems have already been fixed.

Section 7 is an analysis of the data presented in Sections 3, 4, 5, and
6.  It is here that all of the results are considered as a whole and the
problems that have been resolved in later RFCs are correlated.



3.0 Full Standards

Full Internet Standards (most commonly simply referred to as 
"Standards") are fully mature protocol specification that are widely 
implemented and used throughout the Internet.

3.1 RFC 1155 Structure of Management Information

Section 3.2.3.2.  IpAddress defines the following:

   This application-wide type represents a 32-bit internet address.  It
   is represented as an OCTET STRING of length 4, in network byte-order.

There are several instances of the use of this definition in the rest of
the document.

3.2 RFC 1212 Concise MIB definitions

In section 4.1.6 IpAddress is defined as:

          (6)  IpAddress-valued: 4 sub-identifiers, in the familiar
               a.b.c.d notation.


3.3 RFC 1213 Management Information Base

There are far too many instances of IPv4 addresses is this document
to enumerate here.  The particular object groups that are affected
are the IP group, the ICMP group, the TCP group, the UDP group,
and the EGP group.


3.4 RFC 2578 Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)

Section 7.1.5 defines the IpAddress data type:

   The IpAddress type represents a 32-bit internet address.  It is
   represented as an OCTET STRING of length 4, in network byte-order.

   Note that the IpAddress type is a tagged type for historical reasons.
   Network addresses should be represented using an invocation of the
   TEXTUAL-CONVENTION macro.

Note the deprecated status of this type;  see RFC 3291 for details on
the replacement TEXTUAL-CONVENTION definitions.


3.5 RFC 2579 Textual Conventions for SMIv2

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.


3.6 RFC 2580 Conformance Statements for SMIv2

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.


3.7 RFC 2819 Remote Network Monitoring Management Information Base

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.


3.8 RFC 3411 An Architecture for Describing SNMP Management Frameworks

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.


3.9 RFC 3412 Message Processing and Dispatching for the Simple Network
     Management Protocol (SNMP)

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.


3.10 RFC 3413 SNMP Applications

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.


3.11 RFC 3414 User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.


3.12 RFC 3415 View-based Access Control Model (VACM) for the Simple
     Network Management Protocol (SNMP)

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.


3.13 RFC 3416 Protocol Operations for Version 2 of the Simple Network
     Management Protocol (SNMP)

Section 4.2.2.1.  Example of Table Traversal and Section 4.2.3.1.
Another Example of Table Traversal both use objects from MIB2 whose
data contains IPv4 addresses.  Other than their use in these example
sections there are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.


3.14 RFC 3417 Transport Mappings for Version 2 of the Simple Network
     Management Protocol (SNMP)

Section 2 Definitions contains the following definition:

        SnmpUDPAddress ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
            DISPLAY-HINT "1d.1d.1d.1d/2d"
            STATUS       current
            DESCRIPTION
                    "Represents a UDP address:

                        octets   contents        encoding
                        1-4     IP-address      network-byte order
                        5-6     UDP-port        network-byte order
                    "
           SYNTAX       OCTET STRING (SIZE (6))

Section 8.1, "Usage Example," also contains examples which uses IPv4
address, but it has no significance in the operation of the
specification.


3.15 RFC 3418 Management Information Base for Version 2 of the Simple
     Network Management Protocol (SNMP)

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.



4.0 Draft Standards

Draft Standards represent the penultimate standard level in the IETF.
A protocol can only achieve draft standard when there are multiple,
independent, interoperable implementations.  Draft Standards are usually
quite mature and widely used.


4.01 RFC 1493 Definitions of Managed Objects for Bridges

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.


4.02 RFC 1559 DECnet Phase IV MIB Extensions

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.


4.03 RFC 1657 Definitions of Managed Objects for the Fourth
     Version of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP-4) using SMIv2

The MIB defined in this RFC deals with objects in a BGP4 based routing
system and therefore contain many objects that are limited by the 
IpAddress 32-bit value defined in MIB2.  Clearly the values of this MIB 
are limited to IPv4 addresses.  No update is needed, although a new MIB 
should be defined for BGP4+ to allow management of IPv6 addresses and 
routes.


4.04 RFC 1658 Definitions of Managed Objects for Character Stream 
Devices using SMIv2

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.


4.05 RFC 1659 Definitions of Managed Objects for RS-232-like Hardware
     Devices using SMIv2

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.


4.06 RFC 1660 Definitions of Managed Objects for Parallel-printer-like
     Hardware Devices using SMIv2

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.


4.07 RFC 1694 Definitions of Managed Objects for SMDS Interfaces using
     SMIv2

This MIB module definition defines the following subtree:

          ipOverSMDS OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { smdsApplications 1 }

          -- Although the objects in this group are read-only, at the
          -- agent's discretion they may be made read-write so that the
          -- management station, when appropriately authorized, may
          -- change the addressing information related to the
          -- configuration of a logical IP subnetwork implemented on
          -- top of SMDS.

          -- This table is necessary to support RFC1209 (IP-over-SMDS)
          -- and gives information on the Group Addresses and ARP
          -- Addresses used in the Logical IP subnetwork.
          -- One SMDS address may be associated with multiple IP
          -- addresses.  One SNI may be associated with multiple LISs.

Although these object definitions are intended for IPv4 addresses, a 
similar MIB can be defined for IPv6 addressing.


4.08 RFC 1724 RIP Version 2 MIB Extension 

As might be expected, this RFC is filled with IPv4 dependencies since
it defines a MIB module for an IPv4-only routing protocol.  A new MIB 
for RIPng is required.


4.09 RFC 1748 IEEE 802.5 MIB using SMIv2

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.


4.10 RFC 1850 OSPF Version 2 Management Information Base

This MIB defines managed objects for OSPFv2 which is a protocol used
to exchange IPv4 routing information.  Since OSPFv2 is limited to IPv4
addresses a new MIB is required to support a new version of OSPF that
is IPv6 aware.


4.11 RFC 2115 Management Information Base for Frame Relay DTEs
     Using SMIv2

This specification has several examples of how IPv4 addresses might be
mapped to Frame Relay DLCIs.  Other than those examples there are no
IPv4 dependencies in this specification.


4.12 RFC 2790 Host Resources MIB

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.


4.13 RFC 2863 The Interfaces Group MIB

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification. There is some 
discussion in one object definition about an interface performing a 
self test, but the object itself is IP version independent.


4.14 RFC 3592 Definitions of Managed Objects for the Synchronous Optical
      Network/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH)

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.


4.15 RFC 3593 Textual Conventions for MIB Modules Using Performance 
     History Based on 15 Minute Intervals.

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

                                                                       

5.0 Proposed Standards

Proposed Standards are introductory level documents.  There are no
requirements for even a single implementation.  In many cases Proposed
are never implemented or advanced in the IETF standards process.  They
therefore are often just proposed ideas that are presented to the 
Internet community.  Sometimes flaws are exposed or they are one of 
many competing solutions to problems.  In these later cases, no 
discussion is presented as it would not serve the purpose of this 
discussion.


5.001 RFC 1239 Reassignment of experimental MIBs to standard MIBs

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.


5.002 RFC 1269 Definitions of Managed Objects for the Border Gateway
      Protocol: Version 3

The use of BGP3 has been deprecated and is not discussed.


5.003 RFC 1285 FDDI Management Information Base

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.


5.004 RFC 1381 SNMP MIB Extension for X.25 LAPB

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.


5.005 RFC 1382 SNMP MIB Extension for the X.25 Packet Layer 

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.


5.006 RFC 1414 Identification MIB

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.


5.007 RFC 1418 SNMP over OSI

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.


5.008 RFC 1419 SNMP over AppleTalk

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

All of the object definitions above (except trapDestProtocol) mention
only IPv4 addresses but since they use a SYNTAX of OCTET STRING, they 
should work fine for IPv6 addresses.  A new legitimate value of 
trapDestProtocol (i.e. SYNTAX addition of ipv6(3) should make this
specification functional for IPv6.


5.032 RFC 2024 Definitions of Managed Objects for Data Link Switching
      using SMIv2

The following textual conventions are defined:

TAddress ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS  current
    DESCRIPTION
       "Denotes a transport service address.
        For dlswTCPDomain, a TAddress is 4 octets long,
        containing the IP-address in network-byte order."
    SYNTAX  OCTET STRING (SIZE (0..255))

-- DLSw over TCP

-- for an IP address of length 4:

             TCP as a transport protocol."
    SYNTAX       OCTET STRING (SIZE (4))

Additionally there are many object definitions that use a SYNTAX of 
TAddress within the document.  Interestingly the SYNTAX for TAddress 
is an OCTET string of up to 256 characters.  It could easily 
accommodate a similar hybrid format for IPv6 addresses.

A new OID to enhance functionality for DlswTCPAddress could be added
to support IPv6 addresses.

5.062 RFC 2562 Definitions of Protocol and Managed Objects for
      TN3270E Response Time Collection Using SMIv2

This MIB module inherits IP version-independence by virtue of
importing the appropriate definitions from RFC 2561.


5.063 RFC 2564 Application Management MIB

The following textual convention is defined:

   ApplTAddress ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
       STATUS       current
       DESCRIPTION
             "Denotes a transport service address.

             For snmpUDPDomain, an ApplTAddress is 6 octets long,
             the initial 4 octets containing the IP-address in
             network-byte order and the last 2 containing the UDP
             port in network-byte order.  Consult 'Transport Mappings
             for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol
             (SNMPv2)' for further information on snmpUDPDomain."
       SYNTAX       OCTET STRING (SIZE (0..255))


A new TC should be defined to handle IPv6 addresses.


5.064 RFC 2584 Definitions of Managed Objects for APPN/HPR in
      IP Networks

Many of the object definitions described in this document assume the 
use of the IPv4 only TOS header bits.  It is therefore IPv4-only in 
nature and will not support IPv6.


5.065 RFC 2594 Definitions of Managed Objects for WWW Services

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.


5.066 RFC 2605 Directory Server Monitoring MIB

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.


5.067 RFC 2613 Remote Network Monitoring MIB Extensions for
      Switched Networks Version 1.0

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.


5.068 RFC 2618 RADIUS Authentication Client MIB

This RFC defines the following OIDs:

RadiusAuthServerEntry ::= SEQUENCE {
      radiusAuthServerIndex                           Integer32,
      radiusAuthServerAddress                         IpAddress,

            "The IP address of the RADIUS authentication server
             referred to in this table entry."
      ::= { radiusAuthServerEntry 2 }

There needs to be an update to allow an IPv6 based object for this
value.


5.069 RFC 2619 RADIUS Authentication Server MIB

This MIB defines the followings objects:

RadiusAuthClientEntry ::= SEQUENCE {
       radiusAuthClientIndex                           Integer32,
       radiusAuthClientAddress                         IpAddress,

       DESCRIPTION
             "The NAS-IP-Address of the RADIUS authentication client
              referred to in this table entry."
       ::= { radiusAuthClientEntry 2 }

This object needs to be deprecated and replaced by one that
supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.


5.070 RFC 2622 Routing Policy Specification Language (RPSL)

The only objects in the version of RPSL that deal with IP addresses
are defined as:

   <ipv4-address> An IPv4 address is represented as a sequence of four
      integers in the range from 0 to 255 separated by the character dot
      ".".  For example, 128.9.128.5 represents a valid IPv4 address.
      In the rest of this document, we may refer to IPv4 addresses as IP
      addresses.

   <address-prefix> An address prefix is represented as an IPv4 address
      followed by the character slash "/" followed by an integer in the
      range from 0 to 32.  The following are valid address prefixes:
      128.9.128.5/32, 128.9.0.0/16, 0.0.0.0/0; and the following address
      prefixes are invalid:  0/0, 128.9/16 since 0 or 128.9 are not
      strings containing four integers.

There seems to be an awareness of IPv6 because of the terminology but
it is not specifically defined.  Therefore additional objects for IPv6
addresses and prefixes need to be defined.


5.071 RFC 2662 Definitions of Managed Objects for the ADSL
      Lines

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.


5.072 RFC 2667 IP Tunnel MIB

The Abstract of this document says:

   This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB) for use with
   network management protocols in the Internet community.  In
   particular, it describes managed objects used for managing tunnels of
   any type over IPv4 networks.  Extension MIBs may be designed for
   managing protocol-specific objects. Likewise, extension MIBs may be
   designed for managing security-specific objects.  This MIB does not
   support tunnels over non-IPv4 networks (including IPv6 networks).
   Management of such tunnels may be supported by other MIBs.

A similar MIB for tunneling over IPv6 should be defined.


5.073 RFC 2669 DOCSIS Cable Device MIB Cable Device Management
      Information Base for DOCSIS compliant Cable Modems and
      Cable Modem Termination Systems

This document states:

   Please note that the DOCSIS 1.0 standard only requires Cable
   Modems to implement SNMPv1 and to process IPv4 customer traffic.
   Design choices in this MIB reflect those requirements.  Future
   versions of the DOCSIS standard are expected to require support
   for SNMPv3 and IPv6 as well.


5.074 RFC 2670 Radio Frequency (RF) Interface Management Information
      Base for MCNS/DOCSIS compliant RF interfaces

This MIB defines the following objects:

DocsIfCmtsCmStatusEntry ::= SEQUENCE {
            docsIfCmtsCmStatusIndex               Integer32,
            docsIfCmtsCmStatusMacAddress          MacAddress,

             object returns a value of 0.0.0.0. If the Cable Modem has
             multiple IP addresses, this object returns the IP address
             associated with the Cable interface."
        ::= { docsIfCmtsCmStatusEntry 3 }

This object needs to be deprecated and replaced by one that
supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

5.085 RFC 2769 Routing Policy System Replication

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.


5.086 RFC 2787 Definitions of Managed Objects for the Virtual
      Router Redundancy Protocol

As stated in the Overview section:

   Since the VRRP protocol is intended for use with IPv4 routers only,
   this MIB uses the SYNTAX for IP addresses which is specific to IPv4.
   Thus, changes will be required for this MIB to interoperate in an
   IPv6 environment.

      Reference

This specification is both IPv4 and IPv6 aware and needs no changes.


5.093 RFC 2925 Definitions of Managed Objects for Remote
      Ping, Traceroute, and Lookup Operations

This MIB mostly is IPv4 and IPv6 aware.  There are a few
assumptions that are problems, though.  In the following object 
definitions:

 pingCtlDataSize OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX      Unsigned32 (0..65507)
    UNITS       "octets"
    MAX-ACCESS  read-create
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "Specifies the size of the data portion to be
        transmitted in a ping operation in octets.  A ping
        request is usually an ICMP message encoded
        into an IP packet.  An IP packet has a maximum size
        of 65535 octets.  Subtracting the size of the ICMP
        or UDP header (both 8 octets) and the size of the IP
        header (20 octets) yields a maximum size of 65507
        octets."
    DEFVAL { 0 }
    ::= { pingCtlEntry 5 }


 traceRouteCtlDataSize OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX      Unsigned32 (0..65507)
    UNITS       "octets"
    MAX-ACCESS  read-create
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "Specifies the size of the data portion of a traceroute
        request in octets.  A traceroute request is essentially
        transmitted by encoding a UDP datagram into a
        IP packet. So subtracting the size of a UDP header
        (8 octets) and the size of a IP header (20 octets)
        yields a maximum of 65507 octets."
    DEFVAL { 0 }
    ::= { traceRouteCtlEntry 6 }

The DESCRIPTION clauses need to be updated to remove the
IPv4 dependencies.


5.094 RFC 2932 IPv4 Multicast Routing MIB

This specification is only defined for IPv4 and a similar MIB
must be defined for IPv6.


5.095 RFC 2933 Internet Group Management Protocol MIB

As stated in this document:

   Since IGMP is specific to IPv4, this MIB does not support management
   of equivalent functionality for other address families, such as IPv6.


5.096 RFC 2940 Definitions of Managed Objects for Common
      Open Policy Service (COPS) Protocol Clients

This MIB is both IPv4 and IPv6 aware and needs no changes.

6.0 Experimental RFCs

Experimental RFCs typically define protocols that do not have widescale
implementation or usage on the Internet.  They are often propriety in
nature or used in limited arenas.  They are documented to the Internet
community in order to allow potential interoperability or some other
potential useful scenario.  In a few cases they are presented as
alternatives to the mainstream solution to an acknowledged problem.


6.01 RFC 1187 Bulk Table Retrieval with the SNMP

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

7.0  Summary of Results

In the initial survey of RFCs 36 positives were identified out of a 
total of 153, broken down as follows:
 
        Standards                                6 of  15 or 40.00%
        Draft Standards	                         4 of  15 or 26.67%
        Proposed Standards                      26 of 112 or 23.21%
        Experimental RFCs                        0 of  11 or  0.00%

Of those identified many require no action because they document 
outdated and unused protocols, while others are document protocols 
that are actively being updated by the appropriate working groups.  
Additionally there are many instances of standards that should be 
updated but do not cause any operational impact if they are not 
updated.  The remaining instances are documented below.



7.1  Standards

7.1.1 STD 16, Structure of Management Information (RFCs 1155 and 1212)

RFCs 1155 and RFCs 1212 (along with the informational document RFC
1215) define SMIv1.  These documents have been superseded by RFCs
2578, 2579, and 2580 which define SMIv2.  Since SMIv1 is no longer
being used as the basis for new IETF MIB modules, the limitations
identified in this Internet Standard do not require any action.


7.1.2 STD 17 Simple Network Management Protocol (RFC 1213)

The limitations identified have been addressed, RFC1213 has been 
split into multiple modules which have been seen to.


7.2 Draft Standards


7.2.1 BGP4 MIB (RFC 1657)

This problem is currently being addressed by the Inter Domain Routing
(IDR) WG and an ID exists (draft-ietf-idr-bgp4-mib-11.txt).


7.2.2 SMDS MIB (RFC 1694)

See Internet Area standards.  Once a specification for IPv6 over SMDS 
is created a new MIB must be defined.


7.2.3 RIPv2 MIB (RFC 1724)

There is no updated MIB module to cover the problems outlined.  A
new MIB module should be defined.


7.2.4 OSPFv2 MIB (RFC 1850)

This problem is currently being addressed by the OSPF WG and an ID
exists (draft-ietf-ospf-ospfv3-mib-07.txt).


7.2.5 Transport MIB (RFC 1906)

RFC 1906 has been obsoleted by RFC 3417, Transport Mappings for 
SNMP, and the limitations of this specification have been addressed by 
that RFC, which defines TCs that can be used to specify transport
domains in an IP version-independent way.  RFC 3419 recommends that
those TCs be used in place of SnmpUDPAddress when IPv6 support is
required and for all new applications that are not SNMP-specific.


7.3  Proposed Standards


7.3.01 MIB for Multiprotocol Interconnect over X.25 (RFC 1461)

This problem has not been addressed.  If a user requirement for
IPv6 over X.25 develops (which is thought to be unlikely) then
this MIB module will need to be updated in order to accomodate it.


7.3.02 PPP IPCP MIB (RFC 1473)

There is no updated MIB to cover the problems outlined.  A new MIB
should be defined.


7.3.03  Appletalk MIB (RFC 1742)

This problem has not been addressed.  If a user requirement for
IPv6 over Appletalk develops (which is thought to be unlikely)
then this MIB module will need to be updated (or a new MIB module
will need to be created) in order to accomodate it.


7.3.04  The Definitions of Managed Objects for IP Mobility
       Support using SMIv2 (RFC 2006)

The problems are being resolved by the MIP6 WG and there is
an ID (draft-ietf-mip6-mipv6-mib-00.txt).


7.3.05 SMIv2 IP MIB (RFC 2011)

This issue is being resolved by the IPv6 WG and there is an
ID (draft-ietf-ipv6-rfc2011-update-04.txt).


7.3.06 SNMPv2 TCP MIB (RFC 2012)

This issue is being resolved by the IPv6 WG and there is an
ID (draft-ietf-ipv6-rfc2012-update-04.txt).


7.3.07  SNMPv2 UDP MIB (RFC 2013)

This issue is being resolved by the IPv6 WG and there is an
ID (draft-ietf-ipv6-rfc2013-update-01.txt).


7.3.08  RMON-II MIB (RFC 2021)

This issue has been brought to the attention of the RMONMIB WG.
Currently there is an ID (draft-ietf-rmonmib-rmon2-v2-00.txt)
to update RFC 2021, but it does not address the problems that
have been identified;  it is expected that there will be a
resolution in a future version of that ID.


7.3.09  DataLink Switching using SMIv2 MIB (RFC 2024)

The problems have not been addressed and an updated MIB should be 
defined.


7.3.10  IP Forwarding Table MIB (RFC 2096)

This issue is being worked on by the IPv6 WG and an ID exists to
address this (draft-ietf-ipngwg-rfc2096-update-05.txt)


7.3.11  Classical IP & ARP over ATM MIB (RFC 2320)

The current version of Classical IP and ARP over ATM (RFC 2225)
does not support IPv6.  If and when that protocol specification
is updated to add IPv6 support, then new MIB objects to represent
IPv6 addresses will need to be added to this MIB module.


7.3.12  Multicast over UNI 3.0/3.1 ATM MIB (RFC 2417)

The current version of Multicast over UNI 3.0/3.1 ATM (RFC
2022) does not support IPv6.  If and when that protocol
specification is updated to add IPv6 support, then new MIB
objects to represent IPv6 addresses will need to be added to
this MIB module.


7.3.13  ATM MIB (RFC 2515)

The AToM MIB WG is currently collecting implementation reports for RFC
2515 and is considering whether to advance, revise, or retire this
specification.  The problems identified have been brought to the
attention of the WG.


7.3.14  TN3270 MIB (RFC 2562)

The problems identified are not being addressed and a new MIB
module may need to be defined.


7.3.15  Application MIB (RFC 2564)

The problems identified are not being addressed and a new MIB
module may need to be defined.  One possible solution might be
to use the RFC 3419 TCs.


7.3.16  Definitions of Managed Objects for APPN/HPR in IP Networks
        (RFC 2584)

The problems identified are not addressed and a new MIB may be
defined.
