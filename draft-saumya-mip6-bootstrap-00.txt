Abstract 
 
   In mobile IPv6 (MIP6), there is a need to transfer the home agent 
   address, home IP address to the mobile node when the mobile node is 
   in the foreign network. This problem is referred to as bootstrapping. 
   This document defines a Bootstrapping Information Server Function 
   (BISF) and Bootstrapping Information Client Function (BICF). The BICF 
   uses AAA messaging for obtaining the bootstrapping information from 
   the BISF. Such a mechanism can be used by either the integrated or 
   split scenarios.

1. Introduction 
    
   The problem statement for bootstrapping is described in [5]. 
    
   Two mechanisms are currently being discussed in the MIP6 working 
   group to deal with the issue of bootstrapping.  
    
   [8] discusses the handling of the bootstrapping issue in the split 
   architecture whereas [7] discusses the same for the integrated 
   architecture. 
    
   This document defines a Bootstrapping Information Server Function 
   (BISF) and Bootstrapping Information Client Function (BICF). The BISF 
   is a network entity which stores the generated security association. 
   In the integrated scenario, this could be at the NAS or AAAF whereas 
   in the split scenario, this could be at the MSA. The BICF uses a AAA 
   messaging for obtaining the bootstrapping information from the BISF. 
   Appendix of this draft illustrates one such Diameter[4] messaging. 
   Such a mechanism can be used by either the integrated or split 
   scenarios. 
    
2. Scope of this Document 
    
   This document describes a solution for the MIPv6 bootstrapping 
   problem described in [5] using DHCPv6 [1] for both the split scenario 
   as well as the integrated scenario.

3. Terminology  
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",  
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3]. 
    
   MIP6 Bootstrapping     This includes the parameters that are required 
   parameters             for MIP6 bootstrapping like the home address 
                          of the mobile, the home agent address, home      
                          prefix and optionally, the mobile security  
                          associations. 
    
   Bootstrapping          The BISF is a network entity which stores 
   Information Server     bootstrapping information (eg., NAS, AAAF, 
   Function (BISF)        AAAH) 
    
   Bootstrapping          The BICF is a network entity which acquires 
   Information Client     the bootstrapping information from the BISF 
   Function (BICF)        and transfers the same to the client (eg.,  
                          DHCP Server) 
 
4. Existing solutions 
    
   [7] discusses a solution for bootstrapping for the integrated 
   architecture. In this solution, the NAS is fixed as a DHCP relay and 
   adds the bootstrapping information obtained during layer 2 
   authentication to the DHCP message towards the DHCP server. Adding 
   functionality in the relays will require changes in existing relays. 
   Also, the DHCP server behavior will need to be modified to transfer 
   the bootstrapping information received from the relay back to the 
   mobile node. 
    
   [8] discusses a solution for bootstrapping for the split scenario. In 
   this solution, mobile node needs to have the home agent name 
   configured. DNS is used to obtain the home agent IP address using 
   which the mobile node contacts the HA with extensions defined in [9]. 
    
   This draft defines a common method for bootstrapping of MIPv6 
   parameters in both the split and integrated architectures. The BISF 
   name/domain is given by the mobile node and the DHCP Server uses this 
   to obtain the bootstrapping information. In the integrated scenario, 
   the BISF is local (say, NAS) and in the split scenario, the BISF is 
   remote (MSA).

   In the integrated scenario, the access service authorizer and the 
   mobility service authorizer are the same. The architecture for the 
   integrated scenario is shown in Fig 1.

   Figure 2 shows the sequence of steps to obtain the MIPv6 
   bootstrapping parameters in the integrated scenario. 
     
     1. The mobile node performs the access authorization procedure. The 
        figure shows a EAP as an example of authorization protocol.  
     2. Since the L2 authentication is between the MN and AAAH, the NAS 
        encapsulates the EAP packet in a Diameter message and transfers 
        it to the AAAH. The AAAH authenticates the MN and authorizes it 
        for the MIPv6 service. If the MN is authorized for MIPv6, the 
        AAAH transfers the bootstrapping parameters to the NAS via 
        Diameter [7]. 
     3. After L2 authentication is complete, the MN initiates DHCPv6 
        Information request to obtain the MIPv6 bootstrapping parameters

        in addition to other DHCP configuration parameters, if any. The 
        DHCP client will send this message to the 
        All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers multicast address. It also 
        includes the client’s Mobile IP Identity (say, the NAI [2]) in 
        the message. The client MUST include the BISF Identifier option 
        containing the identity of the BISF providing service. This 
        option is defined in section 6.1. 
     4. The DHCP server contacts the BISF (in this case, NAS in the 
        visited network) to obtain the MIPv6 bootstrapping parameters 
        using the AAA messaging  
     5. The DHCP server sends the obtained bootstrapping parameters to 
        the MN in the Home Network Information Option [6] and/or the MIP 
        Security association option (see section 6.2) of the DHCPREPLY.

   The above description assumes the mobile node using stateless auto-
   configuration for IP address acquisition and uses DHCP only to obtain 
   configuration parameters. This mechanism can be applied to the 
   stateful configuration case also.

5.2. Solution for split scenario 
 
   In the split scenario, the access service authorizer and the mobility 
   service authorizer are different. The mobile node sends the MSA name 
   or MSA realm to the DHCP server in the BISF identifier option while 
   requesting bootstrapping parameters. The DHCP Server uses the AAA 
   messaging to transfer the information from the BISF (in this case, 
   the MSA). The architecture for the split scenario is shown in Fig 3.

            Fig. 4: split scenario call flow 
       
 
   Figure 4 shows the sequence of steps to obtain the MIPv6 
   bootstrapping parameters in the split scenario. 
     
     1. After the mobile node completes the L2 authentication with the 
        ASA, the mobile node initiates DHCP to obtain configuration 
        parameters which may include the bootstrapping parameters. The 
        mobile node SHOULD include the BISF identification option (eg: 
        MSA domain) in the DHCPv6 Information Request.  
     2. The DHCP server contacts the BISF (in this case, the MSA) to 
        obtain the configuration parameters which may include the 
        bootstrapping parameters.  
     3. The DHCP server sends the obtained bootstrapping parameters to 
        the MN in the DHCPREPLY 
     4. The MN uses the bootstrapping information received in the 
        DHCPREPLY to send a Binding Update to the HA.

     5. If the BU contains the authentication extensions and HA does not 
        have the security associations, the HA uses mechanisms described 
        in [10] to obtain the security associations from the AAA. 
     6. The HA sends a BA to the MN after authorization. 
    
6. DHCP options 
 
6.1. BISF Identifier Option 
    
   This option is used by the client to inform the DHCP Server of the 
   BISF which will provide the bootstrapping information.

6.2. MIP Security association option 
    
   When the DHCP client requests for establishment of a MIP SA, it 
   includes the option code of the MIP Security Association Option in 
   the option request option. The DHCP server obtains the requested 
   information from the BISF using AAA messaging. On obtaining the MIP 
   SA from the BISF, the DHCP server provides the MIP SA to the DHCP 
   client in the option defined below

10. Appendix 
    
   This section defines the Diameter specification for obtaining the 
   bootstrapping parameters. This section is informational only. 
    
10.1. Diameter Messaging 
 
10.1.1. Fetch-Data-Request (FDR) Command 
       
   The Fetch-Data-Request (FDR) command is indicated by the Command-Code 
   set to TBD and the Command Flags ’R’ bit set. The BICF sends this 
   message to the BISF to obtain the bootstrapping information indicated 
   by Data-Request-Code AVP.     
    
   The ABNF of the FDR message is given below: 
    
   <FDR> ::= < Diameter Header: xxx, REQ, PXY > 
             < Session-Id > 
             { Origin-Host } 
             { Origin-Realm } 
             { Destination-Realm } 
             [ Destination-Host ] 
             [ User-Name ] 
             { Data-Request-Code }  
         1 * { Data-Request-Format }  
           * [ Proxy-Info ] 
           * [ Route-Record ] 
           * [ AVP ] 
    
10.1.2. Fetch-Data-Answer (FDA) Command   
      
   The Fetch-Data-Answer (FDA) is indicated by the Command-Code set to 
   TBD and the Command Flags ’R’ bit cleared.  The BISF sends this 
   message in response to a previously received FDR message.   
          
   The ABNF of the FDA command is given below: 
    
      <FDA> ::= < Diameter Header: xxx, PXY > 
             < Session-Id > 
             { Result-Code } 
             { Origin-Host } 
             { Origin-Realm } 
             [ User-Name ] 
             [ Data-Requested ] 
             [ Data-Request-Format ] 
            * [ Proxy-Info ] 
            * [ Route-Record ] 
            * [ AVP ]

10.2. Diameter AVPs 
       
   This draft introduces the following new AVPs 
     
10.2.1. Data-Request-Code AVP   
         
   The Data-Request-Code AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type enum and 
   indicates the data requested by the client. The list of possible 
   values is to be defined. 
    
10.2.2. Data-Request-Format AVP 
       
   The Data-Request-Format AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type enum and 
   indicates the possible format of the requested/received data. The 
   list of possible values is to be defined. 
    
10.2.3. Data-Requested AVP 
      
   The Data-Requested AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type OctetString and 
   contains the bootstrapping information in the format specified in 
   Data-Request-Format AVP.
