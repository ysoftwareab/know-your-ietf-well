              Extension of GSMP for optical burst switching  June 2002 
 
1. Introduction 
   
  The General Switch Management Protocol (GSMP), which is a general-
  purpose protocol to control a label switch, allows a controller to 
  establish, release, and reserve connections across the switch [1]. It 
  also provides several capabilities for connection management, 
  reservation management, management, status and event management, and 
  configuration so as to satisfy the requested capabilities and control 
  the switch. The evolution form of GSMP has been studied to apply in 
  optical domain as well as in electric domain [2]. The existing GSMP 
  SHOUD be extended to support of optical, SONET/SDH, and IP packet, 
  TDM data. The GSMP controller is connected with OXC and needs to be 
  extended to establish a connection in optical domain.  
   
  Recently, data burst switching technology has been emerging to 
  utilize resources and transport data more efficiently than the 
  existing circuit switching [3]-[6]. Such a data burst switching is 
  recognized an alternative switching technology due to the limitation 
  of optical devices before evolving into optical packet switching. 
   
  This draft intends to describe the required elements and updates to 
  GSMP for high-speed data burst switching. It requires a new 
  reservation scheme for a connection in a switch fabric in real time. 
  In optical domain, there are several types of method to establish a 
  connection before switching data burst [3]-[6]. However we consider 
  the general method which can allow any types of burst switching 
  technology. For doing so, in this draft, we consider a reservation 
  mechanism in the GSMP and requested updates on the message. A switch 
  controller on a node to provide the required functions for switching 
  data burst is illustrated. Finally we briefly refer to the required 
  elements to be expanded in optical domain. 
   
   
2. Switch control architecture 
 
  Figure 1 illustrates a node architecture that is capable of high-
  speed data burst switching based on GSMP interface. This node 
  constitutes optical switching elements that enable data burst 
  switching in real time and control plane that has signaling protocol 
  part and data burst switching controller part. Between two blocks, 
  GSMP master and slave controller perform all required switching 
  functions for making it possible to switching data burst in real time. 
  The detailed description of each block is following.  
   
  The key functions of data burst switching controller are as follows. 
  The ingress node assembles IP packets into bursts. When the burst is 
  at the head of the burst queue, this controller determines the offset 
  time value to be used for this burst and launch a control packet that 
  contains information about this offset time, the length of the burst, 
  and routing information [7]. It also transmits the control 
  information to the GSMP controller in control plane.

  GMPLS Signaling protocol, such as CR-LDP and RSVP-TE, which supports 
  optical switching is used in control plane.  This signaling protocol 
  MUST setup optical label switched path (LSP) before data transmission 
  and release resources. 
   
  We use the GSMP interface for real-time optical switch control. In 
  this interface which is composed of master and slave, the controller 
  (e.g., GSMP Master) issues the reservation request message to the 
  optical switch (e.g., GSMP Slave). The switch replies with a response 
  message indicating either a successful result or a failure. We use 
  the existing GSMP protocol procedure but a particular message MUST be 
  extended to include the required information for data burst switching 
  in optical switching element. Data burst switching unit in optical 
  switching element executes the control commands received by GSMP 
  interface.

3. Reservation management for optical burst switching using GSMP v3 
   
3.1. Reservation methods  
 
  Optical data burst switching can be implemented by reserving 
  bandwidth when a connection request is arrived at an ingress node. 
  During reservation process in intermediate nodes each GSMP switch 
  controller should control bandwidth reservation management for the 
  connection. There are several reservation schemes for data burst 
  switching in real time [3]-[6]. They differ from the way of 
  indicating the end of a burst and the allocation time of a WDM 
  channel start. However, a common feature is that bandwidth for data 
  burst is reserved using a one-way reservation process and a burst can 
  cut through intermediate nodes. 
   
  In the existing fast circuit switching for data burst, when an 
  intermediate node receives a connection request message, GSMP 
  controller makes use of a reservation management for reserving a 
  bandwidth for the connection. The existing defined reservation 
  message can be applied for reserving and establishing a connection in 
  this case. After sending the whole data burst the following 
  connection release message is sent to the destination node to release 
  the reserve bandwidth and disconnect the connection. The whole 
  process of reservation management and control follows that defined in 
  GSMP v3 [1].  
   
  The above data burst switching based on the fast circuit switching 
  reserves the whole bandwidth from the time that receives a connection 
  request message and to the time that receives a connection release 
  message. Therefore it wastes the bandwidth excessively. A new data 
  burst switching technology that overcomes the shortcoming has been 
  proposed and studied [3]-[5]. In this scheme, information about the 
  start time for bandwidth reservation the exact duration of data burst 
  is delivered in control packet. A node that receives such a control 
  packet reserves resource to establish and release a connection more 
  delicate duration using GSMP control mechanism. Since the control 
  packet already contains the duration of data burst, an explicit 
  release message does not required.  
   
  Even though several switching options for data burst, we consider a 
  general reservation scheme which allows all kinds of switching 
  techniques.  
 
3.2. Reservation Request Message for optical burst switching 
 
  In this section we define a required elements and updates to the 
  existing GSMP and propose an extended Reservation Request message in 
  order to enable such a optical data burst switching.  
   
  The Reservation Request message creates a Reservation in the    
  switch and reserves switch resources for a connection that may

  later be established using an Add Branch message [1]. In optical data 
  burst switching, the Reservation Request Message is:  
   
        Message Type = 70  
   
  It uses the same message type as the existing message. The 
  Reservation Request message has the following format for the    
  request message: 
   
    0                   1                   2                   3

4. Other considerations 
   
  This draft focus on reservation procedures to control data burst 
  switching element. To support data burst switching control, the 
  switching element is controlled and managed by GSMP protocol without 
  other control protocol. This mechanism allows GSMP controller of IPû
  based control plane to direct control optical switching elements. 
  Several concepts for optical switching such as optical labels and 
  service and resource abstractions SHOULD be extended to GSMP [2]. We 
  are studying about these issues.

Appendix. Data burst switching in optical domain 
   
1. Definition and features of optical burst switching  
   
  Data burst switching in optical domain is called as an optical burst 
  switching (OBS). Burst switching, as opposed to circuit or packet 
  switching, implies that the network is capable of switching variable 
  length of data. Basically, the core idea of optical burst switching 
  is to use no buffers inside the network and to switch variable length 
  of bursts on the flying using a reservation mechanism. Intermediate 
  nodes are only configured for a short period of time, just enough to 
  pass data burst, and are available to switch other data bursts 
  immediately after. In present day, packet switching in optical domain 
  has severe limitations on optical devices, such as the lack of 
  optical memory, difficulty of synchronization and packet header 
  processing. Therefore, no buffering in a node is the main advantage 
  of optical burst switching to implement.  
   
  Compared with packet switching and circuit switching, optical burst 
  switching has the following differences [4]; A data burst has an 
  intermediate granularity. Bandwidth is reserved in one-way process 
  that a burst can be sent without an acknowledgement for a successful 
  reservation. A burst passes through intermediate nodes without being 
  buffered. Optical burst switching, compared to optical circuit 
  switching based on wavelength routing, can achieve better bandwidth 
  utilization because it allows statistical sharing of each wavelength 
  among flows of bursts that may otherwise consume several wavelength.  
   
  In OBS, a data burst will have a shorter end-to-end latency since the 
  offset time used is often much smaller than the needed time to set up 
  a path in wavelength-routed networks. On the other hand, optical 
  burst switching has lower control overhead compared to optical packet 
  switching because the burst size can be variable and usually longer 
  than packet size. Moreover, a control packet and its corresponding 
  data burst can be loosely coupled in both space (by using out of band 
  signaling) and time (timing gap between control packet and data 
  burst) than a header and its payload in optical packet switching. 
  Therefore, the requirements for processing control packets and 
  synchronizing between data bursts can be less strict than those for 
  processing packet headers and synchronizing between packets. 
 
2. Types of optical burst switching technology 
   
  Various types of optical burst switching technology have been 
  proposed and they are distinguished by the way of indicating the end 
  of a burst and the allocation time of a WDM channel start [3]-[6]. 
  That is, how to open a connection and how to close the connection are 
  the key features of them. A common feature is that bandwidth is 
  reserved at the burst level using a one-way reservation process and a 
  burst can cut through intermediate nodes.

  We briefly introduce three representative data burst switching 
  technologies and consider implementing aspect.  
   
  First, burst switching based on "tell-and-go (TAG)" is similar to 
  fast circuit switching not requiring acknowledgement [3]-[4]. This 
  switching scheme is also called as just-in-time (JIT) [6]. A source 
  node first sends a control packet (or signaling message) just ahead 
  of the data burst in order to reserve bandwidth for a requested 
  connection. Then a corresponding data burst is transmitted without 
  waiting for the acknowledgement that bandwidth has been successfully 
  reserved for the connection. This scheme eliminates the round-trip 
  waiting time before the information is transmitted. The switching 
  fabric in the switches is configured for the incoming data burst as 
  soon as the first signaling message announcing the data burst is 
  received. Finally the source node sends a release message to 
  explicitly release the reserved bandwidth. The operational mechanism 
  is illustrated in Figure 2 [6].

  Let us brief touch a function of a scheduler in an OBS node. The 
  scheduler needs to keep state information for each data burst 
  traversing it in order to configure the switching fabric to route the 
  data burst [6]. This switching scheme requires a single on/off bit 
  for each switching fabric involved in routing a particular data 
  burst; on implies the switching element is busy routing a data burst, 
  off implies the switching element is free to route a new data burst.  
  For implementing the JIT, the signaling protocol functions and 
  signaling messages are defined in [6]. Basic functions of signaling 
  protocol are session declaration, path setup, data transmission, 
  state maintenance, and path release. The basic message types are 
  session declaration, setup, setup_ack, declaration_ack, connect, 
  session release, release, keepalive, and failure.  
   
  Second, in in-band-terminator based burst switching, control 
  information for establishing a connection is sent as either in-band 
  control or out-of-band control, followed by a burst which contains an 
  in-band-terminator (IBT) to indicate the end of the burst [3]-[4]. 
  Bandwidth is reserved as soon as the control information is processed, 
  and released as soon as the IBT is detected. A challenge of 
  implementing IBT-based burst switching in optical networks is to 
  optically recognize the IBT, which requires optical processing. 
   
  Finally, in reserved-a-fixed-duration (RFD) based on burst switching, 
  a control packet is sent first to reserve bandwidth, followed by data 
  after an offset time [3]-[6]. The bandwidth is reserved for a 
  duration specified by the control packet. With offset time and data 
  burst duration information to predict the star time and end time of 
  the data burst this scheme can utilize resource more efficiently than 
  the above switching schemes. Because this scheme reserves the 
  resource for the connection for requested data burst just enough time 
  for transmitting the data burst. Therefore, it is also called a just-
  enough-time (JET) burst switching. As such, this scheme does not need 
  any release or termination mechanism. By choosing the offset time 
  among the data bursts with different services quality of service can 
  be provided and the probability of successful transmission of the 
  burst through the network [3]. The two representative features are 
  delayed reservation which reserves the bandwidth on each link just 
  for the data burst duration after offset time and delay of the 
  arrival of the data burst which reduces blocking probability. However, 
  one drawback of this switching is implementation complexity.

3. Implementing consideration of optical burst switching 
 
  In Optical burst switching a switch fabric should operate and 
  reconfigure in nanoseconds, and hence can support of the dynamic data 
  burst transmission. Requirements of optical switching device for 
  implement OBS are following; fast reconfigurability, low-loss and 
  negligible polarization effects, wavelength independence, transfer of 
  individual wavelengths or wavelength bundles, simple to manufacture, 
  competitive const, and so on [8]. The switching device technology 
  needs to be complemented by a switch fabric architecture that 
  combines the individual optical switching device technology and 
  delivers the capabilities of OBS. The burst switching capable switch 
  fabric should scale to several hundreds of ports and intelligent 
  scheduling algorithms are needed to control the reconfiguration of 
  switching elements.
