Abstract

   This document describes the Minger protocol.  Minger is a protocol 
   which allows a mail handling entity to query a remote service and
   ask the question "do you accept mail for this email address?" It 
   includes security in the form of a hashed shared secret but can also 
   be used anonymously if desired.

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1. Introduction

1.1 The problem

   It is common for elements within a typical email handling topology 
   to be unaware of whether individual local-parts are valid for the   
   mail it accepts.  For example, so-called "edge" servers which provide 
   security oriented services for downstream mail handling elements 
   often do not have an exhaustive listing of all valid local-parts for 
   a given domain.  Thus, they are sometimes forced to accept and process 
   messages which might otherwise be rejected as "user unknown".  
   Similarly, entities offering "backup MX" mail services are rarely 
   privy to a complete local-part listing and are therefore often decide
   to accept messages which might otherwise be rejected.  Finally, even 
   within a common administrative framework of several locally maintained 
   and controlled SMTP servers in a load balanced configuration, it is 
   not always possible for all servers to access a common local-part 
   database.

1.2 Existing solutions

   The need to determine whether an email address contains a valid local
   part has lead to the use of at least two existing mechanisms - Finger 
   [RFC1288] and SMTP "call-forward".  

   Finger [RFC1288] describes a protocol for the exchange of user 
   information.  In theory, Finger could be used to determine whether an 
   account exists by careful examination of the results of a Finger 
   query.  However, Finger suffers from a lack of security which makes 
   its modern day use problematic when coupled with the user level 
   detail it can provide.  Also, Finger requires the use of TCP rather 
   than UDP which seems ill suited to a simple verification scheme.

   SMTP "call-forward" is a term used to describe a widespread practice 
   whereby SMTP servers place an incoming SMTP session on hold while they 
   attempt to use an outbound SMTP session to determine whether or not a 
   given email address is valid.  The theory behind this is as follows:  
   if an SMTP server responds positively to an SMTP RCPT command 
   [RFC2821] with a given email address then this potentially means that 
   the address local-part is valid.  One problem with such a scheme is 
   the lack of efficiency inherent in the need to tear-up and tear-down 
   an SMTP session over TCP.  Also, because these types of SMTP sessions 
   are not purposed to deliver mail, they typically drop connection after 
   the RCPT command is processed.  This leads to a large number of SMTP

   sessions which appear in logs to have simply failed for no reason.  
   This leads to situations in which SMTP transaction logs can no longer 
   distinguish legitimate network errors from "call-forward" traffic.

   SMTP includes a VRFY command which can be used to determine whether
   an email address exists.  VRFY is not in wide-spread use and suffers
   from the same inefficiency concerns described in the discussion on
   SMTP "call-forward".  Additionally, SMTP agents providing mail 
   services to a domain are often not authoritative making VRFY requests 
   potentially unreliable.

   LDAP could be used to determine whether an email address exists.
   However, LDAP is overly complex to configure and maintain.

1.3 The Minger solution

   What's needed is a protocol which is secure, has little overhead, and 
   can be easily invoked to determine whether a given email address is 
   valid or not.  Minger achieves these goals using a shared secret for
   security and UDP to lower overhead.

2. The Minger protocol
 
   Minger is a UDP protocol that operates on port 4069.

   Syntax descriptions use the form described in Augmented Backus-Naur 
   Form for Syntax Specifications (ABNF) [RFC4234].

2.1 The Minger query process

   A Minger client constructs a query string as described below and 
   transmits it over UDP to a Minger server.  The format of the query 
   is as follows:

  ABNF:

   query-string = mailbox [SP "d=" digest] [SP tag-list]

   digest = base64                   ; digest for security
                                     ; base64 defined in [RFC5034]

   digest-text = shared-secret ":" mailbox ; input text for digest

   mailbox = Local-part "@" Domain   ; as defined in [RFC2821]

   shared-secret = 1*50(VCHAR)       ; password credential

Internet-Draft          draft-hathcock-minger-04.txt       November 2007


   tag-list = tag-spec *(SP tag-spec) ; tag/value list

   tag-spec = tag-name "=" tag-value   

   tag-name = 1 * ( ALPHA / DIGIT / "_") ; except 'd'

   tag-value = 1 * (ALPHA / DIGIT / "_")


2.2 Description of query elements

   mailbox  
       
      This is the email address for which verification of 
      existence is desired. 

   digest 

     This is the base64 encoding of the MD5 [RFC1321] hash of
     digest-text.  Digest-text is constructed, the MD5 hash of that
     is computed, and that result is base64 encoded.

   tag-list

     Tag-list is provided so that future capability might be added
     in an easy way.  Tag-names are case-sensitive and MUST NOT
     be used more than once.     

3. Minger responses

   Minger servers return a response string of the following form:
 
  ABNF:

   response-string = mailbox status

   mailbox = Local-part "@" Domain   ; as defined in [RFC2821]

   status = %x30-35                  ; single digit result code
                                     ; from 0 - 5

3.1 Description of response elements
   
   mailbox  
       
      This is the email address for which verification of 
      existence is desired.

Internet-Draft          draft-hathcock-minger-04.txt       November 2007


   status

      The following status codes are defined:

      0 - invalid request (for example, malformed query string)
      1 - access denied (for example, query from unauthorized IP)
      2 - bad or missing credentials (returned when anonymous
          mode is disabled and no credentials were provided in the 
          query string or when the credentials themselves are 
          invalid)
      3 - email address does not exist
      4 - email address exists but can not receive mail (for example, 
          the account associated with the email address has exceeded
          local storage constraints or it is otherwise disabled due 
          to local policy)
      5 - email address exists and is active (able to receive mail)

3.2 Example responses

   Minger response returned when the queried email address does 
   not exist:

      arvel@example.com 3
    
   Minger response returned for invalid credentials:

      arvel@example.com 2
   
   Minger response returned when the queried email address exists: 

      arvel@example.com 5


4. Anonymous mode

   Minger clients MAY attempt anonymous queries; that is, queries which 
   do not contain a shared secret digest within the query string. Minger 
   servers MAY be configured to refuse anonymous queries.  If so, they 
   MUST respond with a status of "2".

5. Security Considerations

   Minger is a protocol which is used to determine whether a given
   email address is valid or not.  If a particular email 
   infrastructure does not wish to advertise the email addresses that
   it services then this protocol should not be employed. 

   If a shared secret is employed to secure Minger from anonymous use 
   that shared secret should be at least 128 bits.


6. IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned tcp & upd port 4069 for Minger.
