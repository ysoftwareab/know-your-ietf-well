   1. Introduction 

     A policy management framework must be realized to provision and 
     configure operational policies related to services and network 
     operations.  Performance objectives (such as those addressed by the 
     Intserv and Diffserv frameworks) and security are examples of 
     service aspects which may have policies associated with them.  
     Policies may also apply to network operations, e.g., for managing 
     policies for monitoring. 

     It is highly desirable that such a policy management framework be 
     as common as possible, so as to allow policies for any operational 
     area to  be expressed in a uniform manner.  This has been the 
     subject of activities in several IETF working groups. 

     This memo defines a common vocabulary for describing concepts and 
     components related to policy management.  It does not describe an 
     architecture or framework.  Instead, it is intended to be used by 
     various IETF working groups to align their terminology and concepts 
     in architecture and framework documents which either address policy 
     management or which specify components and services that are 
     subject to policy management. 

     This memo is a product of the Policy Terminology (POLTERM) BOF.

   2. Terms for Describing Approaches to Policy 

   2.1. Policy 

     A policy is formally defined as an aggregation of policy rules. 
     Each policy rule is comprised of a set of conditions and a 
     corresponding set of actions. The conditions define when the policy 
     rule is applicable. Once a policy rule is so activated, one or more 
     actions contained by that policy rule may then be executed. These 
     actions are associated with either meeting or not meeting the set 
     of conditions specified in the policy rule.  

     Policies can contain policies. This notion of hierarchy is crucial, 
     as it enables complex policies to be built from a set of simpler 
     policies, thereby simplifying their management. It also enables 
     reuse of policy building blocks (policy rules, conditions and 
     actions). 

     Policy Representation in the Policy Framework WG Specific examples 
     of policy representation can be found in the Policy Framework 
     Architecture [ref] 

   2.2. Policy Management 

     Policy management is the area of network management that deals with 
     the control of policies within a network, including installing and 
     deleting policy rules at network devices and monitoring network 
     performance related to the installed policy. Policy management is 
     concerned with the overall behavior of the network, i.e. end-to-end 
     or edge-to-edge, and controls policy based on the ability to 
     provide consistent and predictable network services across the 
     entire network, not just on a device-by-device basis. 

   2.3. Policy Administration 

     Policy administration is the function that creates, modifies and 
     deletes policies, typically based on human input. 

   2.4. Policy Management Area 

     A Policy Management Area is an area of networking that deploys 
     policy and policy management for the purpose of controlling various 
     aspects of the network, network resources, and access to them by 
     the applications and users of the network. Examples include 
     Security, Diffserv, etc. Distinct Policy Management Areas may be 
     represented by the interfaces presented by policy management 
     systems, but this separation does not extend to the underlying data 
     models and information that will be required to implement policies.

   Internet Draft   draft-reichmeyer-polterm-terminology-00.txt March 2000 

   2.5. Policy Domain 

     A policy domain is a collection of objects that have been 
     explicitly grouped together in order to administratively share the 
     same policies. Domains can be nested, in order to reflect 
     hierarchical semantics. Examples are organizational structures, 
     subnets, and a grouping of policies that supply (for example) 
     increasing freedom and/or privileges at lower and lower levels. 

      

     A domain does not encapsulate the objects it contains; rather, it 
     holds references to objects that it contains. A domain is thus very 
     similar in concept to a directory or folder in a file system.  

      

     Domains can be nested within domains. Note, however, that a nested 
     domain is not necessarily a subset of the parent domain, because an 
     object in the nested domain may not be a direct member of its 
     parent domain. 

      

     Policy domains provide a convenient abstraction for specifying 
     policy for individual objects within a large system. Policy domains 
     separate the policy from the entities that the policy affects. This 
     enables the domain membership to be changed without having to 
     change the policy, and vice-versa. It also provides the flexibility 
     to add and remove objects from a policy domain without changing the 
     definition of the policy itself. 

   2.6. Meta-policy     

   2.6.1. Introduction 

     The concept of a policy is expressible in different ways for 
     different consumers of the policy. For example, a system 
     administrator might want to express a policy that configures 
     network elements in business terms. That same policy must therefore 
     be translated into a form that enables devices supporting this 
     business rules to be configured. This is conceptually the same 
     policy, but there are two distinctly different representations of 
     that policy that must be related to each other. This is because the 
     goal of policy is to relate the management aspects (e.g., business 
     rules) of the policy to actions executed in a device. At each level 
     of abstraction, there is a universal set of all possible policies 
     (e.g., different variations of queuing mechanisms).  However, a 
     policy element might elect to support only a subset of the 
     universal set.  By selecting such a subset, it in effect makes a 
     policy decision that constrains other policy decisions.

   Internet Draft   draft-reichmeyer-polterm-terminology-00.txt  March 2000 

   2.6.2. Definition 

     A meta-policy is a policy that defines how policies are made, or 
     how to build other policies. Note, this is not to be confused with 
     policy meta-data (see section 5). 


   3. Terms describing Policy-based Network Management Models 

   3.1. Introduction 

     Three models for policy management are identified in the sections 
     below.  These three models represent different ways of expressing 
     the implementation and execution of policies. Primarily, the 
     network services and resources that are being managed dictate 
     network policies and the method used to access them by the users of 
     the network. 

   3.2. Outsourced Policy  

     An outsourced policy model implements policy by having some 
     components of the policy framework rely upon other components of 
     that same framework to perform policy-related decisions. This model 
     locates the policy decision-making function in a component separate 
     from the device where the policy is executed.   An outsourced 
     policy model is a client-server model. There is a well defined, 
     real-time interaction between components in an outsourced policy 
     model. 

   3.3. Provisioned Policy 

     A provisioned policy model implements policy by configuring devices 
     that execute policy prior to the events that will prompt decisions.  
     Configuration is pushed to the device, e.g., based on time of day 
     or at initial booting of the device.  The focus of the provisioned 
     policy model is on the distribution of configuration information. 
     Events received use downloaded (pre-provisioned) mechanisms to 
     implement  policy; thus, there is no real-time interaction between 
     systems in this model. There is a well-defined interaction between 
     components, but the interaction does not necessarily occur on a 
     real-time basis. 

   3.4. Interactive Policy 

     An interactive policy model implements policy by installing policy 
     expressions within appropriate components of the system. This 
     includes complete and self-contained expression of policy data and 
     rules that defines interaction between a process and its 
     constituent components. The focus is not on distribution of policy 
     rules and data, but rather on naming and being able to refer 
     unambiguously and in a consistent, uniform manner to the 


   Reichmeyer, et. al.          September 2000                    [Page 6] 


   Internet Draft   draft-reichmeyer-polterm-terminology-00.txt  March 2000     


     information required by the process responsible for implementing 
     the given policy. Interaction between components is defined on a 
     system-specific basis. For example, the network in the general case 
     consists of a variety of different devices, each of which has 
     different capabilities. This means that their specific 
     configuration may vary device to device, but their overall handling 
     of traffic (as a simple example) should be conceptually as uniform 
     as possible. So in general there needs to be an interactive 
     communication between the policy server making the decision and the 
     set of devices that it controls that are implementing the decision. 

      


   4. Policy Abstraction and Scoping 

   4.1. Introduction 

     Policy can be expressed using different levels of abstractions. 
     Roles provide a way to scope policy, at the various levels of 
     abstraction, to portions of the network where they apply. A policy 
     is expressed as a set of related policies at different levels of 
     abstraction. This is because the goal of policy is to relate the 
     management aspects (e.g., business rules) of the policy to actions 
     executed in a device. For example, high-level policies that 
     describe how the network should treat different types of traffic 
     may be expressed in a way that is independent of any one particular 
     way of configuring a device. Yet, we still need to develop policies 
     at a lower level that are used to configure specific devices that 
     actually condition the traffic according to these business rules. 
     This relation exists to enable different network vendors and 
     different types of devices to be provisioned in a common way. So, 
     we need to translate between the different representations of 
     policies in a common and consistent way.  Three levels of 
     abstraction have been identified. 

      

   4.2.  Levels of abstraction  

   4.2.1. Administrator-defined policy 

     An administrator-defined policy is a policy that is expressed in 
     human-oriented terms of rules which convey organizational or 
     operational goals, independent of any of the details of how or 
     where the policy will be implemented. For example, the Sales 
     Organization runs a different set of applications compared to the 
     Engineering Organization, and requires different conditioning of 
     their traffic compared to that of the Engineering Organization.

   Internet Draft    draft-reichmeyer-polterm-terminology-00.txt  March 2000 

   4.2.2. Device-independent policy 

     A device-independent policy is a policy that is expressed in terms 
     of rules that describe conditions and actions to be taken by a 
     device in a generic (i.e., implementation-independent) fashion. For 
     example, multiple device-dependent policies could be derived from a 
     single device-independent policy. The single device-independent 
     policy could be described in terms of using various DiffServ Code 
     Points to designate different conditioning for different service 
     classes. This device-independent policy specifies different 
     conditioning to be implemented for different traffic types 
     independent of the type of device that is implementing the traffic.  

   4.2.3. Device-dependent policy 

     A device-dependent policy is a policy that is expressed in terms of 
     rules that describe the conditions and actions to be taken by a 
     specific device in terms that are particular to a given 
     implementation. Continuing the example used in "device-independent 
     policy," a set of device-dependent policies are defined that 
     express how different devices are configured to express the 
     conditioning defined in the single device-independent policy. Each 
     device-dependent policy implements the same traffic conditioning 
     instructions as specified by the device-independent policy, but in 
     a device-specific way.  

   4.3. Scoping with Roles 

     Roles define groups of devices (or device interfaces) that want to 
     share the same configuration of policy. 

      

     For many policy rules, policy roles enable a more efficient 
     implementation of policy. For example, roles can be used to 
     identify a set of policies in a policy repository that are specific 
     to what needs to be accomplished (e.g., find all edge frame relay 
     policies and download them). However, for other types of policies, 
     policy role mechanisms are insufficient. This is primarily because 
     they by themselves are not sufficient to specify the mechanism that 
     they are being used to control (e.g., the above example says 
     nothing about configuring different queues in an interface) to 
     scope them. 


   5. Terms Concerning Modeling and Representation of Policy 

   5.1. Information Model 

     An information model is a representation of the entities in a 
     managed environment and the way that they interact with each other. 


   Reichmeyer, et. al.          September 2000                    [Page 8] 



   Internet Draft    draft-reichmeyer-polterm-terminology-00.txt  March 2000 

     It is independent of any specific repository, application, 
     protocol, or platform. A set of data models can be derived from an 
     information model. 

   5.2. Data Model 

     A data model represents a mapping of the contents of an information 
     model into a form that is specific to a particular type of 
     repository. By binding to a repository, protocol and schema are 
     also bound. However, it should be noted that additional platform- 
     and application-specific mappings may be required. 

      

      

   5.3. Schema 

     A schema is a collection of data models that are each bound to the 
     same type of repository. 

   5.4. Composition of policies 

     Policies are composed of four primary components, or building 
     blocks. These are: policy group, policy rule, policy condition, and 
     policy action. They are briefly defined here. For more complete 
     definition and description of the relationships, see [ref]. 

   5.4.1. Policy Group 

     A policy group is a group of policies or policy rules. 

   5.4.2. Policy Rule 

     A policy rule is a set of conditions and a corresponding set of 
     actions. 

   5.4.3. Policy Condition 

     A policy condition defines the criteria for when a policy rule is 
     to be enforced, that is, when the policy action associated with the 
     policy rule is to be taken.  

   5.4.4. Policy Action 

     A policy action defines what is to be done to enforce a policy rule 
     when the conditions of the policy rule are met.

   Internet Draft   draft-reichmeyer-polterm-terminology-00.txt  March 2000 

   5.5. Policy Meta-data  

     Policy meta-data is a set of data that describes the semantics of a 
     specific policy. For example, meta-data could be used to describe 
     additional semantics that should be associated with a given 
     attribute in a data or information model. Note, this should not be 
     confused with a meta-policy (see section 2). 

      


   6. Terms for Describing Policy Functions 

   6.1. Introduction 

     Policy elements can be described in terms of the functions that 
     they perform. This section defines the basic functions deployed in 
     a policy management system. No assumptions are made regarding the 
     physical elements of the system that implement these functions. 

      

   6.2. Policy Storage and Retrieval 

     Policies and policy rules must be stored and retrieved from 
     storage, as part of the policy management process. This allows for 
     consistent and predictable application of policy across a network. 
     Storage and retrieval can be implemented with different types of 
     storage technologies (e.g. directories and relational databases), 
     which in turn define the type of protocol(s) that is (are) used to 
     access the policy data. Details on the different technologies, 
     protocols, and the impact of using one versus another, is beyond 
     the scope of this draft. 

   6.3. Policy Conversion 

     Policy conversion transforms policy information from a 
     representation used in one part of the policy system to another one 
     used elsewhere in the system. For example, a proxy policy server 
     might convert PIB data (received from a policy server) to CLI 
     format used to talk to its clients.  Policy conversion is a 
     syntactical transform between representations at the same level of

   6.4. Policy Discovery 

     In order to insure a communication can proceed between policy 
     domains, a policy decision may depend upon knowledge of the 
     policies of all policy domains that will affect the communication. 
     Each policy domain will have to 'discover' the policies of the 
     other domains in order to make the correct policy decisions. 

   6.5. Policy Resolution 

     Often misnamed policy negotiation, though no real negotiation takes 
     place. When presented with policies from multiple policy domains, 
     through which a communication must pass, it is necessary to find a 
     common policy supported by all the domains. If no such policy 
     exists, then the communication cannot be completed.  

   6.6. Policy Translation 

     Policy translation transforms a policy from a level of abstraction 
     used in one part of the policy system to another level of 
     abstraction used elsewhere; e.g., a user name gets 'translated' to 
     an IP address. This is a semantic transform from a policy element 
     at one level of abstraction to another.   

   6.7. Policy Control 

     Policy control deals with the processing of policy and policy 
     rules, the installation, deletion, and monitoring of policy in the 
     network. Before a new policy can be installed in the network, it 
     must be verified by the policy management system that it will not 
     conflict with other existing policy in the network, and that it can 
     be executed correctly. 

   6.7.1. Policy Conflict 

     A policy conflict occurs when the conditions of two or more 
     policies can be simultaneously satisfied, but the actions of at 
     least one of the policies can not be simultaneously executed. This 
     implies several things: 

       - one or more policy rules of each of the policies is satisfied 
     by the same request 

       - each condition of each of the conflicting policy rules is 
     satisfied by the same request 

       - one or more actions specified by one policy conflict with one 
     or more actions specified by the other policy

   6.7.2. Policy Conflict Resolution 

     Policy conflicts can be resolved in a number of different ways. The 
     simplest is to change the conditions and/or actions of one of the 
     policies so that it no longer conflicts with the other policies. 
     However, if the policies must remain inherently conflicting, then 
     there are a number of ways to resolve the conflict on an individual 
     event basis, including the following:  

       - apply a "match-first" criteria, wherein conflicts are resolved 
     by matching the first policy that is found 

       - apply a priority order criteria, wherein conflicts are resolved 
     by finding all policy rules which match a given event and selecting 
     only the rule with the highest priority 

       - use additional meta-data to determine which rule or rules 
     should be applied. 

      

   6.7.3. Policy Satisfiability 

     Policy satisfiability refers to determining if a policy can execute 
     successfully or not. For example, a policy might result in 
     reserving bandwidth of 10Mb. However, if only 8 Mb of bandwidth are 
     available, then even though the conditions of the policy are 
     satisfied, it can not be successfully executed, because enough 
     resources do not exist. 

   6.7.4. Policy Feasibility 

     Policy feasibility refers to determining if a given policy can 
     execute safely. This not only means that the policy itself can 
     execute correctly, but that the execution of that policy will not 
     adversely affect other policies that are already deployed.

   7. Terms for describing Functional Elements and Policy Topologies 

   7.1. Introduction 

     Policies are managed and implemented in functional elements, which 
     correspond to real devices.  Functional elements perform one or 
     more functions. Functional elements are not limited to routers and 


   Reichmeyer, et. al.          September 2000                   [Page 12] 



   Internet Draft    draft-reichmeyer-polterm-terminology-00.txt  March 2000 

     switches. For example, host systems and firewalls can also be 
     considered functional elements in a policy framework. 

   7.2. Policy Administrator 

     A policy administrator is a functional entity thatà  performs 
     policy administration function. 

   7.3. Policy Repository 

     A policy repository is a specific type of data store that is used 
     to store policies and policy data. A mapping is required from the 
     repository-independent information model that describes a policy to 
     a repository-specific implementation of that policy. In general, a 
     set of mappings may be made -one for each type of repository. For 
     example, an auxiliary class is a concept that is specific to 
     directories. A mapping for a directory may use auxiliary classes, 
     whereas a mapping to a relational database can not use auxiliary 
     classes. 

     Note that different vendor implementations of the same type of 
     repository may still require an additional mapping from a common 
     data model. For example, you might have a directory data model, and 
     then x additional mappings to account for the differences in how 
     vendors implement the access protocol and specific mechanisms, such 
     as auxiliary classes. 


   8. Terms Describing Interactions Between Policy Components 

   8.1. Access Protocol(s) 

   8.2. Policy Requests 

   8.3. Policy Decisions 

     A policy decision is the abstraction of activating and evaluating 
     one or more policy rules. Each policy rule is interpreted in the 
     context of a specific request (implied or explicit) for accessing 
     and/or using one or more resources. It connotes taking one or more 
     pre-determined  actions based on whether or not a given set of 
     policy conditions were satisfied. 

   8.4. Policy Evaluation 

     Policy evaluation is the determination of whether or not the entity 
     or set of entities that is being controlled by the policy is in a 
     desired policy state.

   Internet Draft    draft-reichmeyer-polterm-terminology-00.txt  March 2000 

   8.5. Policy Enforcement 

     Policy enforcement is the action of placing the entity or set of 
     entities that is under policy control in a desired policy state 
     using a set of management commands. For example, when this 
     definition is applied to network elements, these management 
     commands change the configuration of the device(s) using one or 
     more mechanisms. Enforcement is carried out in the context of a 
     policy rule. 

   8.6. Policy Monitoring 

     Policy monitoring is an on-going active or passive examination of 
     the entity or set of entities that are under policy control. Policy 
     monitoring is done for one or more of the following reasons: 

     1)         to ensure that clients are receiving the services that they 
have 
        contracted for 

     2)         to monitor statistics as part of checking the health of the 
        entity that is under policy control 

     3)         to monitor statistics as part of checking whether policies 
that 
        are currently in use are being satisfied 

     4)         to ensure that clients of a given set of policies are not 
        abusing their privileges 

   8.7. Policy Feedback 

     Closed loop feedback is important to policy networks. This ensures 
     that implementing a policy does not put the system that is under 
     policy control into an unstable state. It can be in the form of 
     acknowledgments to decisions, verification of accounting records, 
     and many other forms. 


   9. Terms describing specific policies 

   9.1. Introduction 

     In some cases, terminology is defined to describe sets of policies 
     related to one or more areas to which policy management is applied. 

   9.2. Terms related to Service Levels 

     One important application of policy is in management of service 
     level commitments by a service provider to a service user.  This 
     may be in the context of a commercial relationship between a 
     service provider and a service user which are two separate entities 
     (e.g., an ISP and a subscriber) or which are two entities within 


   Reichmeyer, et. al.          September 2000                   [Page 14] 



   Internet Draft    draft-reichmeyer-polterm-terminology-00.txt  March 2000 

     the same organization (e.g., an IT organization and a functional 
     department).   

      

   9.2.1. Service Level Agreement (SLA) 

     A service level agreement (SLA) is a service contract between a 
     service user and a service provider that specifies the service a 
     user should receive for all or a portion of their traffic.  An SLA 
     includes  considerations of a business or contractual nature. 

     Note: This term is a generalization of the term as used in 
     Diffserv. 

      

   9.2.2. Service Level Specification (SLS) 

     A Service Level Specification (SLS) is a set of parameters and 
     their values which together define the service offered to a traffic 
     stream by a domain.  An SLS is that part of an SLA that is 
     implementable as one or more policies. 

     Note: This term is a generalization of the term as used in 
     Diffserv.  Also, the term Service Level Objective (SLO) is also 
     used. 

   9.3.  Terms related to security policies 


   10. Security Considerations 

     Security considerations are addressed in the appropriate 
     architecture and framework documents.
