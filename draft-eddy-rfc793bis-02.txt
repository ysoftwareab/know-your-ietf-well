              Transmission Control Protocol Specification
                        draft-eddy-rfc793bis-02

Abstract

   This document specifies the Internet's Transmission Control Protocol
   (TCP).  TCP is an important transport layer protocol in the Internet
   stack, and has continuously evolved over decades of use and growth of
   the Internet.  Over this time, a number of changes have been made to
   TCP as it was specified in RFC 793, though these have only been
   documented in a piecemeal fashion.  This document collects and brings
   those changes together with the protocol specification from RFC 793.
   This document obsoletes RFC 793 and several other RFCs (TODO: list
   all actual RFCs when finished).

   RFC EDITOR NOTE: If approved for publication as an RFC, this should
   be marked additionally as "STD: 7" and replace RFC 793 in that role.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

1.  Purpose and Scope

   In 1981, RFC 793 [2] was released, documenting the Transmission
   Control Protocol (TCP), and replacing earlier specifications for TCP
   that had been published in the past.

   Since that time, TCP has been implemented many times, and has been
   used as a transport protocol for numerous applications on the
   Internet.

   For several decades, RFC 793 plus a number of other documents have
   combined to serve as the specification for TCP [3].  Over time, a
   number of errata have been identified on RFC 793, as well as
   deficiencies in security, performance, and other aspects.  A number
   of enhancements has grown and been documented separately.  These were
   never accumulated together into an update to the base specification.

   The purpose of this document is to bring together all of the IETF
   Standards Track changes that have been made to the basic TCP
   functional specification and unify them into an update of the RFC 793
   protocol specification.  Some companion documents are referenced for
   important algorithms that TCP uses (e.g. for congestion control), but
   have not been attempted to include in this document.  This is a
   conscious choice, as this base specification can be used with
   multiple additional algorithms that are developed and incorporated
   separately, but all TCP implementations need to implement this
   specification as a common basis in order to interoperate.  As some
   additional TCP features have become quite complicated themselves
   (e.g. advanced loss recovery and congestion control), future
   companion documents may attempt to similarly bring these together.

   In addition to the protocol specification that descibes the TCP
   segment format, generation, and processing rules that are to be
   implemented in code, RFC 793 and other updates also contain
   informative and descriptive text for human readers to understand
   aspects of the protocol design and operation.  This document does not
   attempt to alter or update this informative text, and is focused only
   on updating the normative protocol specification.  We preserve
   references to the documentation containing the important explanations
   and rationale, where appropriate.

Internet-Draft              TCP Specification                 March 2014


   This document is intended to be useful both in checking existing TCP
   implementations for conformance, as well as in writing new
   implementations.

2.  Introduction

   RFC 793 contains a discussion of the TCP design goals and provides
   examples of its operation, including examples of connection
   establishment, closing connections, and retransmitting packets to
   repair losses.

   This document describes the basic functionality expected in modern
   implementations of TCP, and replaces the protocol specification in
   RFC 793.  It does not replicate or attempt to update the examples and
   other discussion in RFC 793.  Other documents are referenced to
   provide explanation of the theory of operation, rationale, and
   detailed discussion of design decisions.  This document only focuses
   on the normative behavior of the protocol.

   TEMPORARY EDITOR'S NOTE: This is an early revision in the process of
   updating RFC 793.  Many planned changes are not yet incorporated.

   ***Please do not use this revision as a basis for any work or
   reference.***

   TODO: describe the subsequent structure of the document to-be (e.g.
   will it follow the newtcp BSD implementation?), and mention that a
   list of changes from RFC 793 will be kept in the final section

   TEMPORARY EDITOR'S NOTE: the current revision of this document does
   not yet collect all of the changes that will be in the final version.
   The set of content changes planned for future revisions is roughly:

      -00 was a proposal for the scope of the document and description
      of the need for an update to RFC 793

      -01 incorporated the RFC 793 section 3 content with no additional
      changes into XML2RFC format for easy tracking of the changes
      between RFC 793 and future revisions of the document

      -02 incorporates the verified errata on RFC 793 as of March 20,
      2014

      -03 and beyond are intended to incorporate changes from other RFCs
      that updated 793

3.  Functional Specification

3.1.  Header Format

   TCP segments are sent as internet datagrams.  The Internet Protocol
   header carries several information fields, including the source and
   destination host addresses [2].  A TCP header follows the internet
   header, supplying information specific to the TCP protocol.  This
   division allows for the existence of host level protocols other than
   TCP.

   TCP Header Format

     The sequence number of the first data octet in this segment (except
     when SYN is present).  If SYN is present the sequence number is the
     initial sequence number (ISN) and the first data octet is ISN+1.

   Acknowledgment Number:  32 bits

     If the ACK control bit is set this field contains the value of the
     next sequence number the sender of the segment is expecting to
     receive.  Once a connection is established this is always sent.

   Data Offset:  4 bits

     The number of 32 bit words in the TCP Header.  This indicates where
     the data begins.  The TCP header (even one including options) is an
     integral number of 32 bits long.

   Reserved:  6 bits

     Reserved for future use.  Must be zero.

   Control Bits:  6 bits (from left to right):

        URG: Urgent Pointer field significant
        ACK: Acknowledgment field significant
        PSH: Push Function
        RST: Reset the connection
        SYN: Synchronize sequence numbers
        FIN: No more data from sender

   Window:  16 bits

     The number of data octets beginning with the one indicated in the
     acknowledgment field which the sender of this segment is willing to
     accept.

   Checksum:  16 bits

     The checksum field is the 16 bit one's complement of the one's
     complement sum of all 16 bit words in the header and text.  If a
     segment contains an odd number of header and text octets to be
     checksummed, the last octet is padded on the right with zeros to
     form a 16 bit word for checksum purposes.  The pad is not
     transmitted as part of the segment.  While computing the checksum,
     the checksum field itself is replaced with zeros.

     The checksum also covers a 96 bit pseudo header conceptually
     prefixed to the TCP header.  This pseudo header contains the Source
     Address, the Destination Address, the Protocol, and TCP length.

     This gives the TCP protection against misrouted segments.  This
     information is carried in the Internet Protocol and is transferred
     across the TCP/Network interface in the arguments or results of
     calls by the TCP on the IP.



                   +--------+--------+--------+--------+
                   |           Source Address          |
                   +--------+--------+--------+--------+
                   |         Destination Address       |

                   |  zero  |  PTCL  |    TCP Length   |
                   +--------+--------+--------+--------+

     The TCP Length is the TCP header length plus the data length in
     octets (this is not an explicitly transmitted quantity, but is
     computed), and it does not count the 12 octets of the pseudo
     header.

   Urgent Pointer:  16 bits

     This field communicates the current value of the urgent pointer as
     a positive offset from the sequence number in this segment.  The
     urgent pointer points to the sequence number of the last octet in a
     sequence of urgent data.  This field is only be interpreted in
     segments with the URG control bit set.  EDITOR'S NOTE: TODO need to
     incorporate RFC 6093 here.

   Options:  variable

     Options may occupy space at the end of the TCP header and are a
     multiple of 8 bits in length.  All options are included in the
     checksum.  An option may begin on any octet boundary.  There are
     two cases for the format of an option:

        Case 1: A single octet of option-kind.

        Case 2: An octet of option-kind, an octet of option-length, and
        the actual option-data octets.

     The option-length counts the two octets of option-kind and option-
     length as well as the option-data octets.

     Note that the list of options may be shorter than the data offset
     field might imply.  The content of the header beyond the End-of-
     Option option must be header padding (i.e., zero).

     A TCP must implement all options.

     Currently defined options include (kind indicated in octal):

         Kind     Length    Meaning
         ----     ------    -------
          0         -       End of option list.
          1         -       No-Operation.
          2         4       Maximum Segment Size.

   Specific Option Definitions

        End of Option List

           +--------+
           |00000000|
           +--------+
            Kind=0

        This option code indicates the end of the option list.  This
        might not coincide with the end of the TCP header according to
        the Data Offset field.  This is used at the end of all options,
        not the end of each option, and need only be used if the end of
        the options would not otherwise coincide with the end of the TCP
        header.

        No-Operation

           +--------+
           |00000001|
           +--------+
            Kind=1

        This option code may be used between options, for example, to
        align the beginning of a subsequent option on a word boundary.
        There is no guarantee that senders will use this option, so
        receivers must be prepared to process options even if they do
        not begin on a word boundary.

        Maximum Segment Size

           +--------+--------+---------+--------+
           |00000010|00000100|   max seg size   |
           +--------+--------+---------+--------+
            Kind=2   Length=4

        Maximum Segment Size Option Data: 16 bits

        If this option is present, then it communicates the maximum
        receive segment size at the TCP which sends this segment.  This
        field may be sent in the initial connection request (i.e., in
        segments with the SYN control bit set) and must not be sent in
        other segments.  If this option is not used, any segment size is
        allowed.

   Padding:  variable

     The TCP header padding is used to ensure that the TCP header ends
     and data begins on a 32 bit boundary.  The padding is composed of
     zeros.

3.2.  Terminology

   Before we can discuss very much about the operation of the TCP we
   need to introduce some detailed terminology.  The maintenance of a
   TCP connection requires the remembering of several variables.  We
   conceive of these variables being stored in a connection record
   called a Transmission Control Block or TCB.  Among the variables
   stored in the TCB are the local and remote socket numbers, the
   security and precedence of the connection, pointers to the user's
   send and receive buffers, pointers to the retransmit queue and to the
   current segment.  In addition several variables relating to the send
   and receive sequence numbers are stored in the TCB.

       Send Sequence Variables

         SND.UNA - send unacknowledged
         SND.NXT - send next
         SND.WND - send window
         SND.UP  - send urgent pointer
         SND.WL1 - segment sequence number used for last window update
         SND.WL2 - segment acknowledgment number used for last window
                   update
         ISS     - initial send sequence number

       Receive Sequence Variables

         RCV.NXT - receive next
         RCV.WND - receive window
         RCV.UP  - receive urgent pointer
         IRS     - initial receive sequence number

   The following diagrams may help to relate some of these variables to
   the sequence space.

Internet-Draft              TCP Specification                 March 2014


   A connection progresses through a series of states during its
   lifetime.  The states are: LISTEN, SYN-SENT, SYN-RECEIVED,
   ESTABLISHED, FIN-WAIT-1, FIN-WAIT-2, CLOSE-WAIT, CLOSING, LAST-ACK,
   TIME-WAIT, and the fictional state CLOSED.  CLOSED is fictional
   because it represents the state when there is no TCB, and therefore,
   no connection.  Briefly the meanings of the states are:

      LISTEN - represents waiting for a connection request from any
      remote TCP and port.

      SYN-SENT - represents waiting for a matching connection request
      after having sent a connection request.

      SYN-RECEIVED - represents waiting for a confirming connection
      request acknowledgment after having both received and sent a
      connection request.

      ESTABLISHED - represents an open connection, data received can be
      delivered to the user.  The normal state for the data transfer
      phase of the connection.

      FIN-WAIT-1 - represents waiting for a connection termination
      request from the remote TCP, or an acknowledgment of the
      connection termination request previously sent.

      FIN-WAIT-2 - represents waiting for a connection termination
      request from the remote TCP.

      CLOSE-WAIT - represents waiting for a connection termination
      request from the local user.

      CLOSING - represents waiting for a connection termination request
      acknowledgment from the remote TCP.

      LAST-ACK - represents waiting for an acknowledgment of the
      connection termination request previously sent to the remote TCP
      (this termination request sent to the remote TCP already included
      an acknowledgment of the termination request sent from the remote
      TCP).

      TIME-WAIT - represents waiting for enough time to pass to be sure
      the remote TCP received the acknowledgment of its connection
      termination request.

      CLOSED - represents no connection state at all.

   A TCP connection progresses from one state to another in response to
   events.  The events are the user calls, OPEN, SEND, RECEIVE, CLOSE,

   ABORT, and STATUS; the incoming segments, particularly those
   containing the SYN, ACK, RST and FIN flags; and timeouts.

   The state diagram in Figure 4 illustrates only state changes,
   together with the causing events and resulting actions, but addresses
   neither error conditions nor actions which are not connected with
   state changes.  In a later section, more detail is offered with
   respect to the reaction of the TCP to events.

3.3.  Sequence Numbers

   A fundamental notion in the design is that every octet of data sent
   over a TCP connection has a sequence number.  Since every octet is
   sequenced, each of them can be acknowledged.  The acknowledgment
   mechanism employed is cumulative so that an acknowledgment of
   sequence number X indicates that all octets up to but not including X
   have been received.  This mechanism allows for straight-forward
   duplicate detection in the presence of retransmission.  Numbering of
   octets within a segment is that the first data octet immediately
   following the header is the lowest numbered, and the following octets
   are numbered consecutively.

   It is essential to remember that the actual sequence number space is
   finite, though very large.  This space ranges from 0 to 2**32 - 1.
   Since the space is finite, all arithmetic dealing with sequence
   numbers must be performed modulo 2**32.  This unsigned arithmetic
   preserves the relationship of sequence numbers as they cycle from
   2**32 - 1 to 0 again.  There are some subtleties to computer modulo
   arithmetic, so great care should be taken in programming the
   comparison of such values.  The symbol "=<" means "less than or
   equal" (modulo 2**32).

   The typical kinds of sequence number comparisons which the TCP must
   perform include:

      (a) Determining that an acknowledgment refers to some sequence
      number sent but not yet acknowledged.




Eddy                   Expires September 28, 2014              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft              TCP Specification                 March 2014


      (b) Determining that all sequence numbers occupied by a segment
      have been acknowledged (e.g., to remove the segment from a
      retransmission queue).

      (c) Determining that an incoming segment contains sequence numbers
      which are expected (i.e., that the segment "overlaps" the receive
      window).

   In response to sending data the TCP will receive acknowledgments.
   The following comparisons are needed to process the acknowledgments.

      SND.UNA = oldest unacknowledged sequence number

      SND.NXT = next sequence number to be sent

      SEG.ACK = acknowledgment from the receiving TCP (next sequence
      number expected by the receiving TCP)

      SEG.SEQ = first sequence number of a segment

      SEG.LEN = the number of octets occupied by the data in the segment
      (counting SYN and FIN)

      SEG.SEQ+SEG.LEN-1 = last sequence number of a segment

   A new acknowledgment (called an "acceptable ack"), is one for which
   the inequality below holds:

      SND.UNA < SEG.ACK =< SND.NXT

   A segment on the retransmission queue is fully acknowledged if the
   sum of its sequence number and length is less or equal than the
   acknowledgment value in the incoming segment.

   When data is received the following comparisons are needed:

      RCV.NXT = next sequence number expected on an incoming segments,
      and is the left or lower edge of the receive window

      RCV.NXT+RCV.WND-1 = last sequence number expected on an incoming
      segment, and is the right or upper edge of the receive window

      SEG.SEQ = first sequence number occupied by the incoming segment

      SEG.SEQ+SEG.LEN-1 = last sequence number occupied by the incoming
      segment





Eddy                   Expires September 28, 2014              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft              TCP Specification                 March 2014


   A segment is judged to occupy a portion of valid receive sequence
   space if

      RCV.NXT =< SEG.SEQ < RCV.NXT+RCV.WND

   or

      RCV.NXT =< SEG.SEQ+SEG.LEN-1 < RCV.NXT+RCV.WND

   The first part of this test checks to see if the beginning of the
   segment falls in the window, the second part of the test checks to
   see if the end of the segment falls in the window; if the segment
   passes either part of the test it contains data in the window.

   Actually, it is a little more complicated than this.  Due to zero
   windows and zero length segments, we have four cases for the
   acceptability of an incoming segment:

       Segment Receive  Test
       Length  Window
       ------- -------  -------------------------------------------

          0       0     SEG.SEQ = RCV.NXT

          0      >0     RCV.NXT =< SEG.SEQ < RCV.NXT+RCV.WND

         >0       0     not acceptable

         >0      >0     RCV.NXT =< SEG.SEQ < RCV.NXT+RCV.WND
                     or RCV.NXT =< SEG.SEQ+SEG.LEN-1 < RCV.NXT+RCV.WND

   Note that when the receive window is zero no segments should be
   acceptable except ACK segments.  Thus, it is be possible for a TCP to
   maintain a zero receive window while transmitting data and receiving
   ACKs.  However, even when the receive window is zero, a TCP must
   process the RST and URG fields of all incoming segments.

   We have taken advantage of the numbering scheme to protect certain
   control information as well.  This is achieved by implicitly
   including some control flags in the sequence space so they can be
   retransmitted and acknowledged without confusion (i.e., one and only
   one copy of the control will be acted upon).  Control information is
   not physically carried in the segment data space.  Consequently, we
   must adopt rules for implicitly assigning sequence numbers to
   control.  The SYN and FIN are the only controls requiring this
   protection, and these controls are used only at connection opening
   and closing.  For sequence number purposes, the SYN is considered to
   occur before the first actual data octet of the segment in which it

Internet-Draft              TCP Specification                 March 2014


   occurs, while the FIN is considered to occur after the last actual
   data octet in a segment in which it occurs.  The segment length
   (SEG.LEN) includes both data and sequence space occupying controls.
   When a SYN is present then SEG.SEQ is the sequence number of the SYN.

   Initial Sequence Number Selection

   The protocol places no restriction on a particular connection being
   used over and over again.  A connection is defined by a pair of
   sockets.  New instances of a connection will be referred to as
   incarnations of the connection.  The problem that arises from this is
   -- "how does the TCP identify duplicate segments from previous
   incarnations of the connection?"  This problem becomes apparent if
   the connection is being opened and closed in quick succession, or if
   the connection breaks with loss of memory and is then reestablished.

   To avoid confusion we must prevent segments from one incarnation of a
   connection from being used while the same sequence numbers may still
   be present in the network from an earlier incarnation.  We want to
   assure this, even if a TCP crashes and loses all knowledge of the
   sequence numbers it has been using.  When new connections are
   created, an initial sequence number (ISN) generator is employed which
   selects a new 32 bit ISN.  The generator is bound to a (possibly
   fictitious) 32 bit clock whose low order bit is incremented roughly
   every 4 microseconds.  Thus, the ISN cycles approximately every 4.55
   hours.  Since we assume that segments will stay in the network no
   more than the Maximum Segment Lifetime (MSL) and that the MSL is less
   than 4.55 hours we can reasonably assume that ISN's will be unique.

   For each connection there is a send sequence number and a receive
   sequence number.  The initial send sequence number (ISS) is chosen by
   the data sending TCP, and the initial receive sequence number (IRS)
   is learned during the connection establishing procedure.

   For a connection to be established or initialized, the two TCPs must
   synchronize on each other's initial sequence numbers.  This is done
   in an exchange of connection establishing segments carrying a control
   bit called "SYN" (for synchronize) and the initial sequence numbers.
   As a shorthand, segments carrying the SYN bit are also called "SYNs".
   Hence, the solution requires a suitable mechanism for picking an
   initial sequence number and a slightly involved handshake to exchange
   the ISN's.

   The synchronization requires each side to send it's own initial
   sequence number and to receive a confirmation of it in acknowledgment
   from the other side.  Each side must also receive the other side's
   initial sequence number and send a confirming acknowledgment.

       1) A --> B  SYN my sequence number is X
       2) A <-- B  ACK your sequence number is X
       3) A <-- B  SYN my sequence number is Y
       4) A --> B  ACK your sequence number is Y

   Because steps 2 and 3 can be combined in a single message this is
   called the three way (or three message) handshake.

   A three way handshake is necessary because sequence numbers are not
   tied to a global clock in the network, and TCPs may have different
   mechanisms for picking the ISN's.  The receiver of the first SYN has
   no way of knowing whether the segment was an old delayed one or not,
   unless it remembers the last sequence number used on the connection
   (which is not always possible), and so it must ask the sender to
   verify this SYN.  The three way handshake and the advantages of a
   clock-driven scheme are discussed in [3].

   Knowing When to Keep Quiet

   To be sure that a TCP does not create a segment that carries a
   sequence number which may be duplicated by an old segment remaining
   in the network, the TCP must keep quiet for a maximum segment
   lifetime (MSL) before assigning any sequence numbers upon starting up
   or recovering from a crash in which memory of sequence numbers in use
   was lost.  For this specification the MSL is taken to be 2 minutes.
   This is an engineering choice, and may be changed if experience
   indicates it is desirable to do so.  Note that if a TCP is
   reinitialized in some sense, yet retains its memory of sequence
   numbers in use, then it need not wait at all; it must only be sure to
   use sequence numbers larger than those recently used.

   The TCP Quiet Time Concept

   This specification provides that hosts which "crash" without
   retaining any knowledge of the last sequence numbers transmitted on
   each active (i.e., not closed) connection shall delay emitting any
   TCP segments for at least the agreed Maximum Segment Lifetime (MSL)
   in the internet system of which the host is a part.  In the
   paragraphs below, an explanation for this specification is given.
   TCP implementors may violate the "quiet time" restriction, but only
   at the risk of causing some old data to be accepted as new or new
   data rejected as old duplicated by some receivers in the internet
   system.

   TCPs consume sequence number space each time a segment is formed and
   entered into the network output queue at a source host.  The
   duplicate detection and sequencing algorithm in the TCP protocol
   relies on the unique binding of segment data to sequence space to the



Eddy                   Expires September 28, 2014              [Page 17]

Internet-Draft              TCP Specification                 March 2014


   extent that sequence numbers will not cycle through all 2**32 values
   before the segment data bound to those sequence numbers has been
   delivered and acknowledged by the receiver and all duplicate copies
   of the segments have "drained" from the internet.  Without such an
   assumption, two distinct TCP segments could conceivably be assigned
   the same or overlapping sequence numbers, causing confusion at the
   receiver as to which data is new and which is old.  Remember that
   each segment is bound to as many consecutive sequence numbers as
   there are octets of data and SYN or FIN flags in the segment.

   Under normal conditions, TCPs keep track of the next sequence number
   to emit and the oldest awaiting acknowledgment so as to avoid
   mistakenly using a sequence number over before its first use has been
   acknowledged.  This alone does not guarantee that old duplicate data
   is drained from the net, so the sequence space has been made very
   large to reduce the probability that a wandering duplicate will cause
   trouble upon arrival.  At 2 megabits/sec. it takes 4.5 hours to use
   up 2**32 octets of sequence space.  Since the maximum segment
   lifetime in the net is not likely to exceed a few tens of seconds,
   this is deemed ample protection for foreseeable nets, even if data
   rates escalate to l0's of megabits/sec.  At 100 megabits/sec, the
   cycle time is 5.4 minutes which may be a little short, but still
   within reason.

   The basic duplicate detection and sequencing algorithm in TCP can be
   defeated, however, if a source TCP does not have any memory of the
   sequence numbers it last used on a given connection.  For example, if
   the TCP were to start all connections with sequence number 0, then
   upon crashing and restarting, a TCP might re-form an earlier
   connection (possibly after half-open connection resolution) and emit
   packets with sequence numbers identical to or overlapping with
   packets still in the network which were emitted on an earlier
   incarnation of the same connection.  In the absence of knowledge
   about the sequence numbers used on a particular connection, the TCP
   specification recommends that the source delay for MSL seconds before
   emitting segments on the connection, to allow time for segments from
   the earlier connection incarnation to drain from the system.

   Even hosts which can remember the time of day and used it to select
   initial sequence number values are not immune from this problem
   (i.e., even if time of day is used to select an initial sequence
   number for each new connection incarnation).

   Suppose, for example, that a connection is opened starting with
   sequence number S.  Suppose that this connection is not used much and
   that eventually the initial sequence number function (ISN(t)) takes
   on a value equal to the sequence number, say S1, of the last segment
   sent by this TCP on a particular connection.  Now suppose, at this



Eddy                   Expires September 28, 2014              [Page 18]

Internet-Draft              TCP Specification                 March 2014


   instant, the host crashes, recovers, and establishes a new
   incarnation of the connection.  The initial sequence number chosen is
   S1 = ISN(t) -- last used sequence number on old incarnation of
   connection!  If the recovery occurs quickly enough, any old
   duplicates in the net bearing sequence numbers in the neighborhood of
   S1 may arrive and be treated as new packets by the receiver of the
   new incarnation of the connection.

   The problem is that the recovering host may not know for how long it
   crashed nor does it know whether there are still old duplicates in
   the system from earlier connection incarnations.

   One way to deal with this problem is to deliberately delay emitting
   segments for one MSL after recovery from a crash- this is the "quiet
   time" specification.  Hosts which prefer to avoid waiting are willing
   to risk possible confusion of old and new packets at a given
   destination may choose not to wait for the "quite time".
   Implementors may provide TCP users with the ability to select on a
   connection by connection basis whether to wait after a crash, or may
   informally implement the "quite time" for all connections.
   Obviously, even where a user selects to "wait," this is not necessary
   after the host has been "up" for at least MSL seconds.

   To summarize: every segment emitted occupies one or more sequence
   numbers in the sequence space, the numbers occupied by a segment are
   "busy" or "in use" until MSL seconds have passed, upon crashing a
   block of space-time is occupied by the octets and SYN or FIN flags of
   the last emitted segment, if a new connection is started too soon and
   uses any of the sequence numbers in the space-time footprint of the
   last segment of the previous connection incarnation, there is a
   potential sequence number overlap area which could cause confusion at
   the receiver.

3.4.  Establishing a connection

   The "three-way handshake" is the procedure used to establish a
   connection.  This procedure normally is initiated by one TCP and
   responded to by another TCP.  The procedure also works if two TCP
   simultaneously initiate the procedure.  When simultaneous attempt
   occurs, each TCP receives a "SYN" segment which carries no
   acknowledgment after it has sent a "SYN".  Of course, the arrival of
   an old duplicate "SYN" segment can potentially make it appear, to the
   recipient, that a simultaneous connection initiation is in progress.
   Proper use of "reset" segments can disambiguate these cases.

   Several examples of connection initiation follow.  Although these
   examples do not show connection synchronization using data-carrying
   segments, this is perfectly legitimate, so long as the receiving TCP

   doesn't deliver the data to the user until it is clear the data is
   valid (i.e., the data must be buffered at the receiver until the
   connection reaches the ESTABLISHED state).  The three-way handshake
   reduces the possibility of false connections.  It is the
   implementation of a trade-off between memory and messages to provide
   information for this checking.

   The simplest three-way handshake is shown in Figure 5 below.  The
   figures should be interpreted in the following way.  Each line is
   numbered for reference purposes.  Right arrows (-->) indicate
   departure of a TCP segment from TCP A to TCP B, or arrival of a
   segment at B from A.  Left arrows (<--), indicate the reverse.
   Ellipsis (...) indicates a segment which is still in the network
   (delayed).  An "XXX" indicates a segment which is lost or rejected.
   Comments appear in parentheses.  TCP states represent the state AFTER
   the departure or arrival of the segment (whose contents are shown in
   the center of each line).  Segment contents are shown in abbreviated
   form, with sequence number, control flags, and ACK field.  Other
   fields such as window, addresses, lengths, and text have been left
   out in the interest of clarity.

           Basic 3-Way Handshake for Connection Synchronization

                                 Figure 5

   In line 2 of Figure 5, TCP A begins by sending a SYN segment
   indicating that it will use sequence numbers starting with sequence
   number 100.  In line 3, TCP B sends a SYN and acknowledges the SYN it
   received from TCP A.  Note that the acknowledgment field indicates
   TCP B is now expecting to hear sequence 101, acknowledging the SYN
   which occupied sequence 100.

   At line 4, TCP A responds with an empty segment containing an ACK for
   TCP B's SYN; and in line 5, TCP A sends some data.  Note that the
   sequence number of the segment in line 5 is the same as in line 4

   because the ACK does not occupy sequence number space (if it did, we
   would wind up ACKing ACK's!).

   Simultaneous initiation is only slightly more complex, as is shown in
   Figure 6.  Each TCP cycles from CLOSED to SYN-SENT to SYN-RECEIVED to
   ESTABLISHED.

       TCP A                                            TCP B

                 Simultaneous Connection Synchronization

                                 Figure 6

   The principle reason for the three-way handshake is to prevent old
   duplicate connection initiations from causing confusion.  To deal
   with this, a special control message, reset, has been devised.  If
   the receiving TCP is in a non-synchronized state (i.e., SYN-SENT,
   SYN-RECEIVED), it returns to LISTEN on receiving an acceptable reset.
   If the TCP is in one of the synchronized states (ESTABLISHED, FIN-
   WAIT-1, FIN-WAIT-2, CLOSE-WAIT, CLOSING, LAST-ACK, TIME-WAIT), it
   aborts the connection and informs its user.  We discuss this latter
   case under "half-open" connections below.

                     Recovery from Old Duplicate SYN

                                 Figure 7

   As a simple example of recovery from old duplicates, consider
   Figure 7.  At line 3, an old duplicate SYN arrives at TCP B.  TCP B
   cannot tell that this is an old duplicate, so it responds normally
   (line 4).  TCP A detects that the ACK field is incorrect and returns
   a RST (reset) with its SEQ field selected to make the segment
   believable.  TCP B, on receiving the RST, returns to the LISTEN
   state.  When the original SYN (pun intended) finally arrives at line
   6, the synchronization proceeds normally.  If the SYN at line 6 had
   arrived before the RST, a more complex exchange might have occurred
   with RST's sent in both directions.

   Half-Open Connections and Other Anomalies

   An established connection is said to be "half-open" if one of the
   TCPs has closed or aborted the connection at its end without the
   knowledge of the other, or if the two ends of the connection have
   become desynchronized owing to a crash that resulted in loss of
   memory.  Such connections will automatically become reset if an
   attempt is made to send data in either direction.  However, half-open
   connections are expected to be unusual, and the recovery procedure is
   mildly involved.

   If at site A the connection no longer exists, then an attempt by the
   user at site B to send any data on it will result in the site B TCP
   receiving a reset control message.  Such a message indicates to the

   site B TCP that something is wrong, and it is expected to abort the
   connection.

   Assume that two user processes A and B are communicating with one
   another when a crash occurs causing loss of memory to A's TCP.
   Depending on the operating system supporting A's TCP, it is likely
   that some error recovery mechanism exists.  When the TCP is up again,
   A is likely to start again from the beginning or from a recovery
   point.  As a result, A will probably try to OPEN the connection again
   or try to SEND on the connection it believes open.  In the latter
   case, it receives the error message "connection not open" from the
   local (A's) TCP.  In an attempt to establish the connection, A's TCP
   will send a segment containing SYN.  This scenario leads to the
   example shown in Figure 8.  After TCP A crashes, the user attempts to
   re-open the connection.  TCP B, in the meantime, thinks the
   connection is open.

         TCP A                                           TCP B

                                 Figure 8

   When the SYN arrives at line 3, TCP B, being in a synchronized state,
   and the incoming segment outside the window, responds with an
   acknowledgment indicating what sequence it next expects to hear (ACK
   100).  TCP A sees that this segment does not acknowledge anything it
   sent and, being unsynchronized, sends a reset (RST) because it has
   detected a half-open connection.  TCP B aborts at line 5.  TCP A will
   continue to try to establish the connection; the problem is now
   reduced to the basic 3-way handshake of Figure 5.

   An interesting alternative case occurs when TCP A crashes and TCP B
   tries to send data on what it thinks is a synchronized connection.

   This is illustrated in Figure 9.  In this case, the data arriving at
   TCP A from TCP B (line 2) is unacceptable because no such connection
   exists, so TCP A sends a RST.  The RST is acceptable so TCP B
   processes it and aborts the connection.

   In Figure 10, we find the two TCPs A and B with passive connections
   waiting for SYN.  An old duplicate arriving at TCP B (line 2) stirs B
   into action.  A SYN-ACK is returned (line 3) and causes TCP A to
   generate a RST (the ACK in line 3 is not acceptable).  TCP B accepts
   the reset and returns to its passive LISTEN state.

   A variety of other cases are possible, all of which are accounted for
   by the following rules for RST generation and processing.

   Reset Generation

Internet-Draft              TCP Specification                 March 2014


   As a general rule, reset (RST) must be sent whenever a segment
   arrives which apparently is not intended for the current connection.
   A reset must not be sent if it is not clear that this is the case.

   There are three groups of states:

      1.  If the connection does not exist (CLOSED) then a reset is sent
      in response to any incoming segment except another reset.  In
      particular, SYNs addressed to a non-existent connection are
      rejected by this means.

      If the incoming segment has the ACK bit set, the reset takes its
      sequence number from the ACK field of the segment, otherwise the
      reset has sequence number zero and the ACK field is set to the sum
      of the sequence number and segment length of the incoming segment.
      The connection remains in the CLOSED state.

      2.  If the connection is in any non-synchronized state (LISTEN,
      SYN-SENT, SYN-RECEIVED), and the incoming segment acknowledges
      something not yet sent (the segment carries an unacceptable ACK),
      or if an incoming segment has a security level or compartment
      which does not exactly match the level and compartment requested
      for the connection, a reset is sent.

      If our SYN has not been acknowledged and the precedence level of
      the incoming segment is higher than the precedence level requested
      then either raise the local precedence level (if allowed by the
      user and the system) or send a reset; or if the precedence level
      of the incoming segment is lower than the precedence level
      requested then continue as if the precedence matched exactly (if
      the remote TCP cannot raise the precedence level to match ours
      this will be detected in the next segment it sends, and the
      connection will be terminated then).  If our SYN has been
      acknowledged (perhaps in this incoming segment) the precedence
      level of the incoming segment must match the local precedence
      level exactly, if it does not a reset must be sent.

      If the incoming segment has an ACK field, the reset takes its
      sequence number from the ACK field of the segment, otherwise the
      reset has sequence number zero and the ACK field is set to the sum
      of the sequence number and segment length of the incoming segment.
      The connection remains in the same state.

      3.  If the connection is in a synchronized state (ESTABLISHED,
      FIN-WAIT-1, FIN-WAIT-2, CLOSE-WAIT, CLOSING, LAST-ACK, TIME-WAIT),
      any unacceptable segment (out of window sequence number or
      unacceptable acknowledgment number) must elicit only an empty
      acknowledgment segment containing the current send-sequence number



Eddy                   Expires September 28, 2014              [Page 25]

Internet-Draft              TCP Specification                 March 2014


      and an acknowledgment indicating the next sequence number expected
      to be received, and the connection remains in the same state.

      If an incoming segment has a security level, or compartment, or
      precedence which does not exactly match the level, and
      compartment, and precedence requested for the connection,a reset
      is sent and the connection goes to the CLOSED state.  The reset
      takes its sequence number from the ACK field of the incoming
      segment.

   Reset Processing

   In all states except SYN-SENT, all reset (RST) segments are validated
   by checking their SEQ-fields.  A reset is valid if its sequence
   number is in the window.  In the SYN-SENT state (a RST received in
   response to an initial SYN), the RST is acceptable if the ACK field
   acknowledges the SYN.

   The receiver of a RST first validates it, then changes state.  If the
   receiver was in the LISTEN state, it ignores it.  If the receiver was
   in SYN-RECEIVED state and had previously been in the LISTEN state,
   then the receiver returns to the LISTEN state, otherwise the receiver
   aborts the connection and goes to the CLOSED state.  If the receiver
   was in any other state, it aborts the connection and advises the user
   and goes to the CLOSED state.

3.5.  Closing a Connection

   CLOSE is an operation meaning "I have no more data to send."  The
   notion of closing a full-duplex connection is subject to ambiguous
   interpretation, of course, since it may not be obvious how to treat
   the receiving side of the connection.  We have chosen to treat CLOSE
   in a simplex fashion.  The user who CLOSEs may continue to RECEIVE
   until he is told that the other side has CLOSED also.  Thus, a
   program could initiate several SENDs followed by a CLOSE, and then
   continue to RECEIVE until signaled that a RECEIVE failed because the
   other side has CLOSED.  We assume that the TCP will signal a user,
   even if no RECEIVEs are outstanding, that the other side has closed,
   so the user can terminate his side gracefully.  A TCP will reliably
   deliver all buffers SENT before the connection was CLOSED so a user
   who expects no data in return need only wait to hear the connection
   was CLOSED successfully to know that all his data was received at the
   destination TCP.  Users must keep reading connections they close for
   sending until the TCP says no more data.

   There are essentially three cases:

      1) The user initiates by telling the TCP to CLOSE the connection



Eddy                   Expires September 28, 2014              [Page 26]

Internet-Draft              TCP Specification                 March 2014


      2) The remote TCP initiates by sending a FIN control signal

      3) Both users CLOSE simultaneously

   Case 1:  Local user initiates the close

      In this case, a FIN segment can be constructed and placed on the
      outgoing segment queue.  No further SENDs from the user will be
      accepted by the TCP, and it enters the FIN-WAIT-1 state.  RECEIVEs
      are allowed in this state.  All segments preceding and including
      FIN will be retransmitted until acknowledged.  When the other TCP
      has both acknowledged the FIN and sent a FIN of its own, the first
      TCP can ACK this FIN.  Note that a TCP receiving a FIN will ACK
      but not send its own FIN until its user has CLOSED the connection
      also.

   Case 2:  TCP receives a FIN from the network

      If an unsolicited FIN arrives from the network, the receiving TCP
      can ACK it and tell the user that the connection is closing.  The
      user will respond with a CLOSE, upon which the TCP can send a FIN
      to the other TCP after sending any remaining data.  The TCP then
      waits until its own FIN is acknowledged whereupon it deletes the
      connection.  If an ACK is not forthcoming, after the user timeout
      the connection is aborted and the user is told.

   Case 3:  both users close simultaneously

      A simultaneous CLOSE by users at both ends of a connection causes
      FIN segments to be exchanged.  When all segments preceding the
      FINs have been processed and acknowledged, each TCP can ACK the
      FIN it has received.  Both will, upon receiving these ACKs, delete
      the connection.

3.6.  Precedence and Security

   The intent is that connection be allowed only between ports operating
   with exactly the same security and compartment values and at the
   higher of the precedence level requested by the two ports.

Internet-Draft              TCP Specification                 March 2014


   The precedence and security parameters used in TCP are exactly those
   defined in the Internet Protocol (IP) [2].  Throughout this TCP
   specification the term "security/compartment" is intended to indicate
   the security parameters used in IP including security, compartment,
   user group, and handling restriction.

   A connection attempt with mismatched security/compartment values or a
   lower precedence value must be rejected by sending a reset.
   Rejecting a connection due to too low a precedence only occurs after
   an acknowledgment of the SYN has been received.

   Note that TCP modules which operate only at the default value of
   precedence will still have to check the precedence of incoming
   segments and possibly raise the precedence level they use on the
   connection.

   The security parameters may be used even in a non-secure environment
   (the values would indicate unclassified data), thus hosts in non-
   secure environments must be prepared to receive the security
   parameters, though they need not send them.

3.7.  Data Communication

   Once the connection is established data is communicated by the
   exchange of segments.  Because segments may be lost due to errors
   (checksum test failure), or network congestion, TCP uses
   retransmission (after a timeout) to ensure delivery of every segment.
   Duplicate segments may arrive due to network or TCP retransmission.
   As discussed in the section on sequence numbers the TCP performs
   certain tests on the sequence and acknowledgment numbers in the
   segments to verify their acceptability.

   The sender of data keeps track of the next sequence number to use in
   the variable SND.NXT.  The receiver of data keeps track of the next
   sequence number to expect in the variable RCV.NXT.  The sender of
   data keeps track of the oldest unacknowledged sequence number in the
   variable SND.UNA.  If the data flow is momentarily idle and all data
   sent has been acknowledged then the three variables will be equal.

   When the sender creates a segment and transmits it the sender
   advances SND.NXT.  When the receiver accepts a segment it advances
   RCV.NXT and sends an acknowledgment.  When the data sender receives
   an acknowledgment it advances SND.UNA.  The extent to which the
   values of these variables differ is a measure of the delay in the
   communication.  The amount by which the variables are advanced is the
   length of the data and SYN or FIN flags in the segment.  Note that
   once in the ESTABLISHED state all segments must carry current
   acknowledgment information.

Internet-Draft              TCP Specification                 March 2014


   The CLOSE user call implies a push function, as does the FIN control
   flag in an incoming segment.

   Retransmission Timeout

   NOTE: TODO this needs to be updated in light of 1122 4.2.2.15 and
   errata 573; this will be done as part of RFC 1122 incorporation into
   this document.
   Because of the variability of the networks that compose an
   internetwork system and the wide range of uses of TCP connections the
   retransmission timeout must be dynamically determined.  One procedure
   for determining a retransmission timeout is given here as an
   illustration.

   An Example Retransmission Timeout Procedure

      Measure the elapsed time between sending a data octet with a
      particular sequence number and receiving an acknowledgment that
      covers that sequence number (segments sent do not have to match
      segments received).  This measured elapsed time is the Round Trip
      Time (RTT).  Next compute a Smoothed Round Trip Time (SRTT) as:

         SRTT = ( ALPHA * SRTT ) + ((1-ALPHA) * RTT)

      and based on this, compute the retransmission timeout (RTO) as:

         RTO = min[UBOUND,max[LBOUND,(BETA*SRTT)]]

      where UBOUND is an upper bound on the timeout (e.g., 1 minute),
      LBOUND is a lower bound on the timeout (e.g., 1 second), ALPHA is
      a smoothing factor (e.g., .8 to .9), and BETA is a delay variance
      factor (e.g., 1.3 to 2.0).

   The Communication of Urgent Information

   The objective of the TCP urgent mechanism is to allow the sending
   user to stimulate the receiving user to accept some urgent data and
   to permit the receiving TCP to indicate to the receiving user when
   all the currently known urgent data has been received by the user.

   This mechanism permits a point in the data stream to be designated as
   the end of urgent information.  Whenever this point is in advance of
   the receive sequence number (RCV.NXT) at the receiving TCP, that TCP
   must tell the user to go into "urgent mode"; when the receive
   sequence number catches up to the urgent pointer, the TCP must tell
   user to go into "normal mode".  If the urgent pointer is updated
   while the user is in "urgent mode", the update will be invisible to
   the user.



Eddy                   Expires September 28, 2014              [Page 30]

Internet-Draft              TCP Specification                 March 2014


   The method employs a urgent field which is carried in all segments
   transmitted.  The URG control flag indicates that the urgent field is
   meaningful and must be added to the segment sequence number to yield
   the urgent pointer.  The absence of this flag indicates that there is
   no urgent data outstanding.

   To send an urgent indication the user must also send at least one
   data octet.  If the sending user also indicates a push, timely
   delivery of the urgent information to the destination process is
   enhanced.

   Managing the Window

   The window sent in each segment indicates the range of sequence
   numbers the sender of the window (the data receiver) is currently
   prepared to accept.  There is an assumption that this is related to
   the currently available data buffer space available for this
   connection.

   Indicating a large window encourages transmissions.  If more data
   arrives than can be accepted, it will be discarded.  This will result
   in excessive retransmissions, adding unnecessarily to the load on the
   network and the TCPs.  Indicating a small window may restrict the
   transmission of data to the point of introducing a round trip delay
   between each new segment transmitted.

   The mechanisms provided allow a TCP to advertise a large window and
   to subsequently advertise a much smaller window without having
   accepted that much data.  This, so called "shrinking the window," is
   strongly discouraged.  The robustness principle dictates that TCPs
   will not shrink the window themselves, but will be prepared for such
   behavior on the part of other TCPs.

   The sending TCP must be prepared to accept from the user and send at
   least one octet of new data even if the send window is zero.  The
   sending TCP must regularly retransmit to the receiving TCP even when
   the window is zero.  Two minutes is recommended for the
   retransmission interval when the window is zero.  This retransmission
   is essential to guarantee that when either TCP has a zero window the
   re-opening of the window will be reliably reported to the other.

   When the receiving TCP has a zero window and a segment arrives it
   must still send an acknowledgment showing its next expected sequence
   number and current window (zero).

   The sending TCP packages the data to be transmitted into segments
   which fit the current window, and may repackage segments on the




Eddy                   Expires September 28, 2014              [Page 31]

Internet-Draft              TCP Specification                 March 2014


   retransmission queue.  Such repackaging is not required, but may be
   helpful.

   In a connection with a one-way data flow, the window information will
   be carried in acknowledgment segments that all have the same sequence
   number so there will be no way to reorder them if they arrive out of
   order.  This is not a serious problem, but it will allow the window
   information to be on occasion temporarily based on old reports from
   the data receiver.  A refinement to avoid this problem is to act on
   the window information from segments that carry the highest
   acknowledgment number (that is segments with acknowledgment number
   equal or greater than the highest previously received).

   The window management procedure has significant influence on the
   communication performance.  The following comments are suggestions to
   implementers.

   Window Management Suggestions

      Allocating a very small window causes data to be transmitted in
      many small segments when better performance is achieved using
      fewer large segments.

      One suggestion for avoiding small windows is for the receiver to
      defer updating a window until the additional allocation is at
      least X percent of the maximum allocation possible for the
      connection (where X might be 20 to 40).

      Another suggestion is for the sender to avoid sending small
      segments by waiting until the window is large enough before
      sending data.  If the user signals a push function then the data
      must be sent even if it is a small segment.

      Note that the acknowledgments should not be delayed or unnecessary
      retransmissions will result.  One strategy would be to send an
      acknowledgment when a small segment arrives (with out updating the
      window information), and then to send another acknowledgment with
      new window information when the window is larger.

      The segment sent to probe a zero window may also begin a break up
      of transmitted data into smaller and smaller segments.  If a
      segment containing a single data octet sent to probe a zero window
      is accepted, it consumes one octet of the window now available.
      If the sending TCP simply sends as much as it can whenever the
      window is non zero, the transmitted data will be broken into
      alternating big and small segments.  As time goes on, occasional
      pauses in the receiver making window allocation available will
      result in breaking the big segments into a small and not quite so



Eddy                   Expires September 28, 2014              [Page 32]

Internet-Draft              TCP Specification                 March 2014


      big pair.  And after a while the data transmission will be in
      mostly small segments.

      The suggestion here is that the TCP implementations need to
      actively attempt to combine small window allocations into larger
      windows, since the mechanisms for managing the window tend to lead
      to many small windows in the simplest minded implementations.

3.8.  Interfaces

   There are of course two interfaces of concern: the user/TCP interface
   and the TCP/lower-level interface.  We have a fairly elaborate model
   of the user/TCP interface, but the interface to the lower level
   protocol module is left unspecified here, since it will be specified
   in detail by the specification of the lower level protocol.  For the
   case that the lower level is IP we note some of the parameter values
   that TCPs might use.

3.8.1.  User/TCP Interface

   The following functional description of user commands to the TCP is,
   at best, fictional, since every operating system will have different
   facilities.  Consequently, we must warn readers that different TCP
   implementations may have different user interfaces.  However, all
   TCPs must provide a certain minimum set of services to guarantee that
   all TCP implementations can support the same protocol hierarchy.
   This section specifies the functional interfaces required of all TCP
   implementations.

   TCP User Commands

      The following sections functionally characterize a USER/TCP
      interface.  The notation used is similar to most procedure or
      function calls in high level languages, but this usage is not
      meant to rule out trap type service calls (e.g., SVCs, UUOs,
      EMTs).

      The user commands described below specify the basic functions the
      TCP must perform to support interprocess communication.
      Individual implementations must define their own exact format, and
      may provide combinations or subsets of the basic functions in
      single calls.  In particular, some implementations may wish to
      automatically OPEN a connection on the first SEND or RECEIVE
      issued by the user for a given connection.

      In providing interprocess communication facilities, the TCP must
      not only accept commands, but must also return information to the
      processes it serves.  The latter consists of:

Internet-Draft              TCP Specification                 March 2014


         (a) general information about a connection (e.g., interrupts,
         remote close, binding of unspecified foreign socket).

         (b) replies to specific user commands indicating success or
         various types of failure.

      Open

         Format: OPEN (local port, foreign socket, active/passive [,
         timeout] [, precedence] [, security/compartment] [, options])
         -> local connection name

         We assume that the local TCP is aware of the identity of the
         processes it serves and will check the authority of the process
         to use the connection specified.  Depending upon the
         implementation of the TCP, the local network and TCP
         identifiers for the source address will either be supplied by
         the TCP or the lower level protocol (e.g., IP).  These
         considerations are the result of concern about security, to the
         extent that no TCP be able to masquerade as another one, and so
         on.  Similarly, no process can masquerade as another without
         the collusion of the TCP.

         If the active/passive flag is set to passive, then this is a
         call to LISTEN for an incoming connection.  A passive open may
         have either a fully specified foreign socket to wait for a
         particular connection or an unspecified foreign socket to wait
         for any call.  A fully specified passive call can be made
         active by the subsequent execution of a SEND.

         A transmission control block (TCB) is created and partially
         filled in with data from the OPEN command parameters.

         On an active OPEN command, the TCP will begin the procedure to
         synchronize (i.e., establish) the connection at once.

         The timeout, if present, permits the caller to set up a timeout
         for all data submitted to TCP.  If data is not successfully
         delivered to the destination within the timeout period, the TCP
         will abort the connection.  The present global default is five
         minutes.

         The TCP or some component of the operating system will verify
         the users authority to open a connection with the specified
         precedence or security/compartment.  The absence of precedence
         or security/compartment specification in the OPEN call
         indicates the default values must be used.




Eddy                   Expires September 28, 2014              [Page 34]

Internet-Draft              TCP Specification                 March 2014


         TCP will accept incoming requests as matching only if the
         security/compartment information is exactly the same and only
         if the precedence is equal to or higher than the precedence
         requested in the OPEN call.

         The precedence for the connection is the higher of the values
         requested in the OPEN call and received from the incoming
         request, and fixed at that value for the life of the
         connection.Implementers may want to give the user control of
         this precedence negotiation.  For example, the user might be
         allowed to specify that the precedence must be exactly matched,
         or that any attempt to raise the precedence be confirmed by the
         user.

         A local connection name will be returned to the user by the
         TCP.  The local connection name can then be used as a short
         hand term for the connection defined by the <local socket,
         foreign socket> pair.

      Send

         Format: SEND (local connection name, buffer address, byte
         count, PUSH flag, URGENT flag [,timeout])

         This call causes the data contained in the indicated user
         buffer to be sent on the indicated connection.  If the
         connection has not been opened, the SEND is considered an
         error.  Some implementations may allow users to SEND first; in
         which case, an automatic OPEN would be done.  If the calling
         process is not authorized to use this connection, an error is
         returned.

         If the PUSH flag is set, the data must be transmitted promptly
         to the receiver, and the PUSH bit will be set in the last TCP
         segment created from the buffer.  If the PUSH flag is not set,
         the data may be combined with data from subsequent SENDs for
         transmission efficiency.

         If the URGENT flag is set, segments sent to the destination TCP
         will have the urgent pointer set.  The receiving TCP will
         signal the urgent condition to the receiving process if the
         urgent pointer indicates that data preceding the urgent pointer
         has not been consumed by the receiving process.  The purpose of
         urgent is to stimulate the receiver to process the urgent data
         and to indicate to the receiver when all the currently known
         urgent data has been received.  The number of times the sending
         user's TCP signals urgent will not necessarily be equal to the




Eddy                   Expires September 28, 2014              [Page 35]

Internet-Draft              TCP Specification                 March 2014


         number of times the receiving user will be notified of the
         presence of urgent data.

         If no foreign socket was specified in the OPEN, but the
         connection is established (e.g., because a LISTENing connection
         has become specific due to a foreign segment arriving for the
         local socket), then the designated buffer is sent to the
         implied foreign socket.  Users who make use of OPEN with an
         unspecified foreign socket can make use of SEND without ever
         explicitly knowing the foreign socket address.

         However, if a SEND is attempted before the foreign socket
         becomes specified, an error will be returned.  Users can use
         the STATUS call to determine the status of the connection.  In
         some implementations the TCP may notify the user when an
         unspecified socket is bound.

         If a timeout is specified, the current user timeout for this
         connection is changed to the new one.

         In the simplest implementation, SEND would not return control
         to the sending process until either the transmission was
         complete or the timeout had been exceeded.  However, this
         simple method is both subject to deadlocks (for example, both
         sides of the connection might try to do SENDs before doing any
         RECEIVEs) and offers poor performance, so it is not
         recommended.  A more sophisticated implementation would return
         immediately to allow the process to run concurrently with
         network I/O, and, furthermore, to allow multiple SENDs to be in
         progress.  Multiple SENDs are served in first come, first
         served order, so the TCP will queue those it cannot service
         immediately.

         We have implicitly assumed an asynchronous user interface in
         which a SEND later elicits some kind of SIGNAL or pseudo-
         interrupt from the serving TCP.  An alternative is to return a
         response immediately.  For instance, SENDs might return
         immediate local acknowledgment, even if the segment sent had
         not been acknowledged by the distant TCP.  We could
         optimistically assume eventual success.  If we are wrong, the
         connection will close anyway due to the timeout.  In
         implementations of this kind (synchronous), there will still be
         some asynchronous signals, but these will deal with the
         connection itself, and not with specific segments or buffers.

         In order for the process to distinguish among error or success
         indications for different SENDs, it might be appropriate for
         the buffer address to be returned along with the coded response



Eddy                   Expires September 28, 2014              [Page 36]

Internet-Draft              TCP Specification                 March 2014


         to the SEND request.  TCP-to-user signals are discussed below,
         indicating the information which should be returned to the
         calling process.

      Receive

         Format: RECEIVE (local connection name, buffer address, byte
         count) -> byte count, urgent flag, push flag

         This command allocates a receiving buffer associated with the
         specified connection.  If no OPEN precedes this command or the
         calling process is not authorized to use this connection, an
         error is returned.

         In the simplest implementation, control would not return to the
         calling program until either the buffer was filled, or some
         error occurred, but this scheme is highly subject to deadlocks.
         A more sophisticated implementation would permit several
         RECEIVEs to be outstanding at once.  These would be filled as
         segments arrive.  This strategy permits increased throughput at
         the cost of a more elaborate scheme (possibly asynchronous) to
         notify the calling program that a PUSH has been seen or a
         buffer filled.

         If enough data arrive to fill the buffer before a PUSH is seen,
         the PUSH flag will not be set in the response to the RECEIVE.
         The buffer will be filled with as much data as it can hold.  If
         a PUSH is seen before the buffer is filled the buffer will be
         returned partially filled and PUSH indicated.

         If there is urgent data the user will have been informed as
         soon as it arrived via a TCP-to-user signal.  The receiving
         user should thus be in "urgent mode".  If the URGENT flag is
         on, additional urgent data remains.  If the URGENT flag is off,
         this call to RECEIVE has returned all the urgent data, and the
         user may now leave "urgent mode".  Note that data following the
         urgent pointer (non-urgent data) cannot be delivered to the
         user in the same buffer with preceding urgent data unless the
         boundary is clearly marked for the user.

         To distinguish among several outstanding RECEIVEs and to take
         care of the case that a buffer is not completely filled, the
         return code is accompanied by both a buffer pointer and a byte
         count indicating the actual length of the data received.

         Alternative implementations of RECEIVE might have the TCP
         allocate buffer storage, or the TCP might share a ring buffer
         with the user.

      Close

         Format: CLOSE (local connection name)

         This command causes the connection specified to be closed.  If
         the connection is not open or the calling process is not
         authorized to use this connection, an error is returned.
         Closing connections is intended to be a graceful operation in
         the sense that outstanding SENDs will be transmitted (and
         retransmitted), as flow control permits, until all have been
         serviced.  Thus, it should be acceptable to make several SEND
         calls, followed by a CLOSE, and expect all the data to be sent
         to the destination.  It should also be clear that users should
         continue to RECEIVE on CLOSING connections, since the other
         side may be trying to transmit the last of its data.  Thus,
         CLOSE means "I have no more to send" but does not mean "I will
         not receive any more."  It may happen (if the user level
         protocol is not well thought out) that the closing side is
         unable to get rid of all its data before timing out.  In this
         event, CLOSE turns into ABORT, and the closing TCP gives up.

         The user may CLOSE the connection at any time on his own
         initiative, or in response to various prompts from the TCP
         (e.g., remote close executed, transmission timeout exceeded,
         destination inaccessible).

         Because closing a connection requires communication with the
         foreign TCP, connections may remain in the closing state for a
         short time.  Attempts to reopen the connection before the TCP
         replies to the CLOSE command will result in error responses.

         Close also implies push function.

      Status

         Format: STATUS (local connection name) -> status data

         This is an implementation dependent user command and could be
         excluded without adverse effect.  Information returned would
         typically come from the TCB associated with the connection.

         This command returns a data block containing the following
         information:

            local socket,
            foreign socket,
            local connection name,
            receive window,

            send window,
            connection state,
            number of buffers awaiting acknowledgment,
            number of buffers pending receipt,
            urgent state,
            precedence,
            security/compartment,
            and transmission timeout.

         Depending on the state of the connection, or on the
         implementation itself, some of this information may not be
         available or meaningful.  If the calling process is not
         authorized to use this connection, an error is returned.  This
         prevents unauthorized processes from gaining information about
         a connection.

      Abort

         Format: ABORT (local connection name)

         This command causes all pending SENDs and RECEIVES to be
         aborted, the TCB to be removed, and a special RESET message to
         be sent to the TCP on the other side of the connection.
         Depending on the implementation, users may receive abort
         indications for each outstanding SEND or RECEIVE, or may simply
         receive an ABORT-acknowledgment.

      TCP-to-User Messages

         It is assumed that the operating system environment provides a
         means for the TCP to asynchronously signal the user program.
         When the TCP does signal a user program, certain information is
         passed to the user.  Often in the specification the information
         will be an error message.  In other cases there will be
         information relating to the completion of processing a SEND or
         RECEIVE or other user call.

         The following information is provided:

           Local Connection Name                    Always
           Response String                          Always
           Buffer Address                           Send & Receive
           Byte count (counts bytes received)       Receive
           Push flag                                Receive

3.8.2.  TCP/Lower-Level Interface

   The TCP calls on a lower level protocol module to actually send and
   receive information over a network.  One case is that of the ARPA
   internetwork system where the lower level module is the Internet
   Protocol (IP) [2].

   If the lower level protocol is IP it provides arguments for a type of
   service and for a time to live.  TCP uses the following settings for
   these parameters:

      Type of Service = Precedence: given by user, Delay: normal,
      Throughput: normal, Reliability: normal; or binary XXX00000, where
      XXX are the three bits determining precedence, e.g. 000 means
      routine precedence.

      Time to Live = one minute, or 00111100.

         Note that the assumed maximum segment lifetime is two minutes.
         Here we explicitly ask that a segment be destroyed if it cannot
         be delivered by the internet system within one minute.

   If the lower level is IP (or other protocol that provides this
   feature) and source routing is used, the interface must allow the
   route information to be communicated.  This is especially important
   so that the source and destination addresses used in the TCP checksum
   be the originating source and ultimate destination.  It is also
   important to preserve the return route to answer connection requests.

   Any lower level protocol will have to provide the source address,
   destination address, and protocol fields, and some way to determine
   the "TCP length", both to provide the functional equivalent service
   of IP and to be used in the TCP checksum.

3.9.  Event Processing

   The processing depicted in this section is an example of one possible
   implementation.  Other implementations may have slightly different
   processing sequences, but they should differ from those in this
   section only in detail, not in substance.

   The activity of the TCP can be characterized as responding to events.
   The events that occur can be cast into three categories: user calls,
   arriving segments, and timeouts.  This section describes the
   processing the TCP does in response to each of the events.  In many
   cases the processing required depends on the state of the connection.

   Events that occur:

      Timeouts

         USER TIMEOUT
         RETRANSMISSION TIMEOUT
         TIME-WAIT TIMEOUT


   The model of the TCP/user interface is that user commands receive an
   immediate return and possibly a delayed response via an event or
   pseudo interrupt.  In the following descriptions, the term "signal"
   means cause a delayed response.

   Error responses are given as character strings.  For example, user
   commands referencing connections that do not exist receive "error:
   connection not open".

   Please note in the following that all arithmetic on sequence numbers,
   acknowledgment numbers, windows, et cetera, is modulo 2**32 the size
   of the sequence number space.  Also note that "=<" means less than or
   equal to (modulo 2**32).

   A natural way to think about processing incoming segments is to
   imagine that they are first tested for proper sequence number (i.e.,
   that their contents lie in the range of the expected "receive window"
   in the sequence number space) and then that they are generally queued
   and processed in sequence number order.

   When a segment overlaps other already received segments we
   reconstruct the segment to contain just the new data, and adjust the
   header fields to be consistent.

   Note that if no state change is mentioned the TCP stays in the same
   state.

   OPEN Call

      CLOSED STATE (i.e., TCB does not exist)

         Create a new transmission control block (TCB) to hold
         connection state information.  Fill in local socket identifier,
         foreign socket, precedence, security/compartment, and user
         timeout information.  Note that some parts of the foreign
         socket may be unspecified in a passive OPEN and are to be
         filled in by the parameters of the incoming SYN segment.
         Verify the security and precedence requested are allowed for
         this user, if not return "error: precedence not allowed" or
         "error: security/compartment not allowed."  If passive enter
         the LISTEN state and return.  If active and the foreign socket
         is unspecified, return "error: foreign socket unspecified"; if
         active and the foreign socket is specified, issue a SYN
         segment.  An initial send sequence number (ISS) is selected.  A
         SYN segment of the form <SEQ=ISS><CTL=SYN> is sent.  Set
         SND.UNA to ISS, SND.NXT to ISS+1, enter SYN-SENT state, and
         return.

         If the caller does not have access to the local socket
         specified, return "error: connection illegal for this process".
         If there is no room to create a new connection, return "error:
         insufficient resources".

      LISTEN STATE

         If active and the foreign socket is specified, then change the
         connection from passive to active, select an ISS.  Send a SYN
         segment, set SND.UNA to ISS, SND.NXT to ISS+1.  Enter SYN-SENT
         state.  Data associated with SEND may be sent with SYN segment
         or queued for transmission after entering ESTABLISHED state.
         The urgent bit if requested in the command must be sent with
         the data segments sent as a result of this command.  If there
         is no room to queue the request, respond with "error:

      CLOSED STATE (i.e., TCB does not exist)

         If the user does not have access to such a connection, return

         Otherwise return "error: connection does not exist".

         If insufficient incoming segments are queued to satisfy the

         remember the RECEIVE, respond with "error: insufficient
         resources".

         Reassemble queued incoming segments into receive buffer and
         return to user.  Mark "push seen" (PUSH) if this is the case.

         If RCV.UP is in advance of the data currently being passed to
         the user notify the user of the presence of urgent data.

         When the TCP takes responsibility for delivering data to the
         user that fact must be communicated to the sender via an
         acknowledgment.  The formation of such an acknowledgment is
         described below in the discussion of processing an incoming
         segment.

      CLOSE-WAIT STATE

         Since the remote side has already sent FIN, RECEIVEs must be
         satisfied by text already on hand, but not yet delivered to the
         user.  If no text is awaiting delivery, the RECEIVE will get a
         "error: connection closing" response.  Otherwise, any remaining
         text can be used to satisfy the RECEIVE.

   SEGMENT ARRIVES

      If the state is CLOSED (i.e., TCB does not exist) then

         all data in the incoming segment is discarded.  An incoming
         segment containing a RST is discarded.  An incoming segment not
         containing a RST causes a RST to be sent in response.  The
         acknowledgment and sequence field values are selected to make
         the reset sequence acceptable to the TCP that sent the
         offending segment.

         If the ACK bit is off, sequence number zero is used,

            <SEQ=0><ACK=SEG.SEQ+SEG.LEN><CTL=RST,ACK>

         If the ACK bit is on,

            <SEQ=SEG.ACK><CTL=RST>

         Return.

      If the state is LISTEN then

         first check for an RST

            An incoming RST should be ignored.  Return.

         second check for an ACK

            Any acknowledgment is bad if it arrives on a connection
            still in the LISTEN state.  An acceptable reset segment
            should be formed for any arriving ACK-bearing segment.  The
            RST should be formatted as follows:

               <SEQ=SEG.ACK><CTL=RST>

            Return.

         third check for a SYN

            If the SYN bit is set, check the security.  If the security/
            compartment on the incoming segment does not exactly match
            the security/compartment in the TCB then send a reset and
            return.

            other control or text should be queued for processing later.
            ISS should be selected and a SYN segment sent of the form:

               <SEQ=ISS><ACK=RCV.NXT><CTL=SYN,ACK>

            SND.NXT is set to ISS+1 and SND.UNA to ISS.  The connection
            state should be changed to SYN-RECEIVED.  Note that any
            other incoming control or data (combined with SYN) will be
            processed in the SYN-RECEIVED state, but processing of SYN
            and ACK should not be repeated.  If the listen was not fully
            specified (i.e., the foreign socket was not fully
            specified), then the unspecified fields should be filled in
            now.

         fourth other text or control

            Any other control or text-bearing segment (not containing
            SYN) must have an ACK and thus would be discarded by the ACK
            processing.  An incoming RST segment could not be valid,
            since it could not have been sent in response to anything
            sent by this incarnation of the connection.  So you are
            unlikely to get here, but if you do, drop the segment, and
            return.

      If the state is SYN-SENT then

         first check the ACK bit

            If the ACK bit is set

               If SEG.ACK =< ISS, or SEG.ACK > SND.NXT, send a reset
               (unless the RST bit is set, if so drop the segment and
               return)

                  <SEQ=SEG.ACK><CTL=RST>

               and discard the segment.  Return.

               If SND.UNA < SEG.ACK =< SND.NXT then the ACK is
               acceptable.  (TODO: in processing Errata ID 3300, it was
               noted that some stacks in the wild that do not send data
               on the SYN are just checking that SEG.ACK == SND.NXT ...
               think about whether anything should be said about that
               here)

         second check the RST bit

            If the RST bit is set

               If the ACK was acceptable then signal the user "error:
               connection reset", drop the segment, enter CLOSED state,
               delete TCB, and return.  Otherwise (no ACK) drop the
               segment and return.

         third check the security and precedence

            If the security/compartment in the segment does not exactly
            match the security/compartment in the TCB, send a reset

               If there is an ACK

                  <SEQ=SEG.ACK><CTL=RST>

               Otherwise

                  <SEQ=0><ACK=SEG.SEQ+SEG.LEN><CTL=RST,ACK>

            If there is an ACK

               The precedence in the segment must match the precedence
               in the TCB, if not, send a reset

                  <SEQ=SEG.ACK><CTL=RST>

            If there is no ACK

               If the precedence in the segment is higher than the
               precedence in the TCB then if allowed by the user and the
               system raise the precedence in the TCB to that in the
               segment, if not allowed to raise the prec then send a
               reset.

                  <SEQ=0><ACK=SEG.SEQ+SEG.LEN><CTL=RST,ACK>

               If the precedence in the segment is lower than the
               precedence in the TCB continue.

            If a reset was sent, discard the segment and return.

         fourth check the SYN bit

            This step should be reached only if the ACK is ok, or there
            is no ACK, and it the segment did not contain a RST.

            If the SYN bit is on and the security/compartment and
            precedence are acceptable then, RCV.NXT is set to SEG.SEQ+1,
            IRS is set to SEG.SEQ.  SND.UNA should be advanced to equal
            SEG.ACK (if there is an ACK), and any segments on the
            retransmission queue which are thereby acknowledged should
            be removed.

            If SND.UNA > ISS (our SYN has been ACKed), change the
            connection state to ESTABLISHED, form an ACK segment

               <SEQ=SND.NXT><ACK=RCV.NXT><CTL=ACK>

            and send it.  Data or controls which were queued for
            transmission may be included.  If there are other controls
            or text in the segment then continue processing at the sixth
            step below where the URG bit is checked, otherwise return.

            Otherwise enter SYN-RECEIVED, form a SYN,ACK segment

               <SEQ=ISS><ACK=RCV.NXT><CTL=SYN,ACK>

            and send it.  Set the variables:

               SND.WND <- SEG.WND
               SND.WL1 <- SEG.SEQ
               SND.WL2 <- SEG.ACK

            If there are other controls or text in the segment, queue
            them for processing after the ESTABLISHED state has been
            reached, return.

         fifth, if neither of the SYN or RST bits is set then drop the
         segment and return.

      Otherwise,

      first check sequence number

         SYN-RECEIVED STATE
         ESTABLISHED STATE
         FIN-WAIT-1 STATE

Internet-Draft              TCP Specification                 March 2014


         FIN-WAIT-2 STATE
         CLOSE-WAIT STATE
         CLOSING STATE
         LAST-ACK STATE
         TIME-WAIT STATE

            Segments are processed in sequence.  Initial tests on
            arrival are used to discard old duplicates, but further
            processing is done in SEG.SEQ order.  If a segment's
            contents straddle the boundary between old and new, only the
            new parts should be processed.

            There are four cases for the acceptability test for an
            incoming segment:



         Segment Receive  Test
         Length  Window
         ------- -------  -------------------------------------------

            0       0     SEG.SEQ = RCV.NXT

            0      >0     RCV.NXT =< SEG.SEQ < RCV.NXT+RCV.WND

           >0       0     not acceptable

           >0      >0     RCV.NXT =< SEG.SEQ < RCV.NXT+RCV.WND
                       or RCV.NXT =< SEG.SEQ+SEG.LEN-1 < RCV.NXT+RCV.WND

            If the RCV.WND is zero, no segments will be acceptable, but
            special allowance should be made to accept valid ACKs, URGs
            and RSTs.

            If an incoming segment is not acceptable, an acknowledgment
            should be sent in reply (unless the RST bit is set, if so
            drop the segment and return):

               <SEQ=SND.NXT><ACK=RCV.NXT><CTL=ACK>

            After sending the acknowledgment, drop the unacceptable
            segment and return.

            In the following it is assumed that the segment is the
            idealized segment that begins at RCV.NXT and does not exceed
            the window.  One could tailor actual segments to fit this
            assumption by trimming off any portions that lie outside the
            window (including SYN and FIN), and only processing further



Eddy                   Expires September 28, 2014              [Page 55]

            if the segment then begins at RCV.NXT.  Segments with higher
            beginning sequence numbers should be held for later
            processing.

         second check the RST bit,

            SYN-RECEIVED STATE

               If the RST bit is set

                  If this connection was initiated with a passive OPEN
                  (i.e., came from the LISTEN state), then return this
                  connection to LISTEN state and return.  The user need
                  not be informed.  If this connection was initiated
                  with an active OPEN (i.e., came from SYN-SENT state)
                  then the connection was refused, signal the user
                  "connection refused".  In either case, all segments on
                  the retransmission queue should be removed.  And in
                  the active OPEN case, enter the CLOSED state and
                  delete the TCB, and return.

            ESTABLISHED
            FIN-WAIT-1
            FIN-WAIT-2
            CLOSE-WAIT

               If the RST bit is set then, any outstanding RECEIVEs and
               SEND should receive "reset" responses.  All segment
               queues should be flushed.  Users should also receive an
               unsolicited general "connection reset" signal.  Enter the
               CLOSED state, delete the TCB, and return.

            CLOSING STATE
            LAST-ACK STATE
            TIME-WAIT


               If the RST bit is set then, enter the CLOSED state,
               delete the TCB, and return.

         third check security and precedence

            SYN-RECEIVED

               If the security/compartment and precedence in the segment
               do not exactly match the security/compartment and
               precedence in the TCB then send a reset, and return.

            FIN-WAIT-1
            FIN-WAIT-2
            CLOSE-WAIT
            CLOSING
            LAST-ACK
            TIME-WAIT

               If the security/compartment and precedence in the segment
               do not exactly match the security/compartment and
               precedence in the TCB then send a reset, any outstanding
               RECEIVEs and SEND should receive "reset" responses.  All
               segment queues should be flushed.  Users should also
               receive an unsolicited general "connection reset" signal.
               Enter the CLOSED state, delete the TCB, and return.

            Note this check is placed following the sequence check to
            prevent a segment from an old connection between these ports
            with a different security or precedence from causing an
            abort of the current connection.

         fourth, check the SYN bit,

            SYN-RECEIVED
            ESTABLISHED STATE
            FIN-WAIT STATE-1
            FIN-WAIT STATE-2
            CLOSE-WAIT STATE
            CLOSING STATE
            LAST-ACK STATE
            TIME-WAIT STATE

               TODO: need to incorporate RFC 1122 4.2.2.20(e) here

               If the SYN is in the window it is an error, send a reset,
               any outstanding RECEIVEs and SEND should receive "reset"
               responses, all segment queues should be flushed, the user
               should also receive an unsolicited general "connection
               reset" signal, enter the CLOSED state, delete the TCB,
               and return.

               If the SYN is not in the window this step would not be
               reached and an ack would have been sent in the first step
               (sequence number check).

         fifth check the ACK field,

            if the ACK bit is off drop the segment and return

            if the ACK bit is on

               SYN-RECEIVED STATE

                  If SND.UNA < SEG.ACK =< SND.NXT then enter ESTABLISHED
                  state and continue processing with variables below set
                  to:

                     SND.WND <- SEG.WND
                     SND.WL1 <- SEG.SEQ
                     SND.WL2 <- SEG.ACK

                     If the segment acknowledgment is not acceptable,
                     form a reset segment,

                        <SEQ=SEG.ACK><CTL=RST>

                     and send it.

               ESTABLISHED STATE

                  If SND.UNA < SEG.ACK =< SND.NXT then, set SND.UNA <-
                  SEG.ACK.  Any segments on the retransmission queue
                  which are thereby entirely acknowledged are removed.
                  Users should receive positive acknowledgments for
                  buffers which have been SENT and fully acknowledged
                  (i.e., SEND buffer should be returned with "ok"
                  response).  If the ACK is a duplicate (SEG.ACK =<
                  SND.UNA), it can be ignored.  If the ACK acks
                  something not yet sent (SEG.ACK > SND.NXT) then send
                  an ACK, drop the segment, and return.

                  If SND.UNA =< SEG.ACK =< SND.NXT, the send window
                  should be updated.  If (SND.WL1 < SEG.SEQ or (SND.WL1
                  = SEG.SEQ and SND.WL2 =< SEG.ACK)), set SND.WND <-
                  SEG.WND, set SND.WL1 <- SEG.SEQ, and set SND.WL2 <-
                  SEG.ACK.

                  Note that SND.WND is an offset from SND.UNA, that
                  SND.WL1 records the sequence number of the last
                  segment used to update SND.WND, and that SND.WL2
                  records the acknowledgment number of the last segment
                  used to update SND.WND.  The check here prevents using
                  old segments to update the window.

                  In addition to the processing for the ESTABLISHED
                  state, if our FIN is now acknowledged then enter FIN-
                  WAIT-2 and continue processing in that state.

               FIN-WAIT-2 STATE

                  In addition to the processing for the ESTABLISHED
                  state, if the retransmission queue is empty, the
                  user's CLOSE can be acknowledged ("ok") but do not
                  delete the TCB.

               CLOSE-WAIT STATE

                  Do the same processing as for the ESTABLISHED state.

               CLOSING STATE

                  In addition to the processing for the ESTABLISHED
                  state, if the ACK acknowledges our FIN then enter the
                  TIME-WAIT state, otherwise ignore the segment.

               LAST-ACK STATE

                  The only thing that can arrive in this state is an
                  acknowledgment of our FIN.  If our FIN is now
                  acknowledged, delete the TCB, enter the CLOSED state,
                  and return.

               TIME-WAIT STATE

                  The only thing that can arrive in this state is a
                  retransmission of the remote FIN.  Acknowledge it, and
                  restart the 2 MSL timeout.

         sixth, check the URG bit,

            ESTABLISHED STATE
            FIN-WAIT-1 STATE
            FIN-WAIT-2 STATE

               If the URG bit is set, RCV.UP <- max(RCV.UP,SEG.UP), and
               signal the user that the remote side has urgent data if
               the urgent pointer (RCV.UP) is in advance of the data
               consumed.  If the user has already been signaled (or is
               still in the "urgent mode") for this continuous sequence
               of urgent data, do not signal the user again.

            CLOSE-WAIT STATE

            CLOSING STATE
            LAST-ACK STATE
            TIME-WAIT

               This should not occur, since a FIN has been received from
               the remote side.  Ignore the URG.

         seventh, process the segment text,

            ESTABLISHED STATE
            FIN-WAIT-1 STATE
            FIN-WAIT-2 STATE

               Once in the ESTABLISHED state, it is possible to deliver
               segment text to user RECEIVE buffers.  Text from segments
               can be moved into buffers until either the buffer is full
               or the segment is empty.  If the segment empties and
               carries an PUSH flag, then the user is informed, when the
               buffer is returned, that a PUSH has been received.

               When the TCP takes responsibility for delivering the data
               to the user it must also acknowledge the receipt of the
               data.

               Once the TCP takes responsibility for the data it
               advances RCV.NXT over the data accepted, and adjusts
               RCV.WND as appropriate to the current buffer
               availability.  The total of RCV.NXT and RCV.WND should
               not be reduced.

                  <SEQ=SND.NXT><ACK=RCV.NXT><CTL=ACK>

               This acknowledgment should be piggybacked on a segment
               being transmitted if possible without incurring undue
               delay.

               This should not occur, since a FIN has been received from
               the remote side.  Ignore the segment text.

         eighth, check the FIN bit,

            Do not process the FIN if the state is CLOSED, LISTEN or
            SYN-SENT since the SEG.SEQ cannot be validated; drop the
            segment and return.

            If the FIN bit is set, signal the user "connection closing"
            and return any pending RECEIVEs with same message, advance
            RCV.NXT over the FIN, and send an acknowledgment for the
            FIN.  Note that FIN implies PUSH for any segment text not
            yet delivered to the user.

           a Host and an IMP".  The specification of interface between a
           host and the ARPANET.

   ACK
           A control bit (acknowledge) occupying no sequence space,
           which indicates that the acknowledgment field of this segment
           specifies the next sequence number the sender of this segment
           is expecting to receive, hence acknowledging receipt of all
           previous sequence numbers.

   ARPANET message
           The unit of transmission between a host and an IMP in the
           ARPANET.  The maximum size is about 1012 octets (8096 bits).

   ARPANET packet
           A unit of transmission used internally in the ARPANET between
           IMPs.  The maximum size is about 126 octets (1008 bits).

   connection
           A logical communication path identified by a pair of sockets.

   datagram
           A message sent in a packet switched computer communications
           network.

   Destination Address
           The destination address, usually the network and host
           identifiers.

   FIN
           A control bit (finis) occupying one sequence number, which
           indicates that the sender will send no more data or control
           occupying sequence space.

   fragment
           A portion of a logical unit of data, in particular an
           internet fragment is a portion of an internet datagram.

   FTP
           A file transfer protocol.

   header
           Control information at the beginning of a message, segment,
           fragment, packet or block of data.

           messages from the point of view of the communication network.

   Identification
           An Internet Protocol field.  This identifying value assigned
           by the sender aids in assembling the fragments of a datagram.

   IMP
           The Interface Message Processor, the packet switch of the
           ARPANET.

   internet address
           A source or destination address specific to the host level.

   internet datagram
           The unit of data exchanged between an internet module and the
           higher level protocol together with the internet header.

   internet fragment
           A portion of the data of an internet datagram with an
           internet header.

   IP
           Internet Protocol.

   IRS
           The Initial Receive Sequence number.  The first sequence
           number used by the sender on a connection.

   ISN
           The Initial Sequence Number.  The first sequence number used
           on a connection, (either ISS or IRS).  Selected on a clock
           based procedure.

   ISS
           The Initial Send Sequence number.  The first sequence number
           used by the sender on a connection.

   leader
           Control information at the beginning of a message or block of
           data.  In particular, in the ARPANET, the control information
           on an ARPANET message at the host-IMP interface.

   left sequence
           This is the next sequence number to be acknowledged by the
           data receiving TCP (or the lowest currently unacknowledged

           sequence number) and is sometimes referred to as the left
           edge of the send window.

   local packet
           The unit of transmission within a local network.

   module
           An implementation, usually in software, of a protocol or
           other procedure.

   MSL
           Maximum Segment Lifetime, the time a TCP segment can exist in
           the internetwork system.  Arbitrarily defined to be 2
           minutes.

   octet
           An eight bit byte.

   Options
           An Option field may contain several options, and each option
           may be several octets in length.  The options are used
           primarily in testing situations; for example, to carry
           timestamps.  Both the Internet Protocol and TCP provide for
           options fields.

   packet
           A package of data with a header which may or may not be
           logically complete.  More often a physical packaging than a
           logical packaging of data.

   port
           The portion of a socket that specifies which logical input or
           output channel of a process is associated with the data.

   process
           A program in execution.  A source or destination of data from
           the point of view of the TCP or other host-to-host protocol.

   PUSH
           A control bit occupying no sequence space, indicating that
           this segment contains data that must be pushed through to the
           receiving user.

   RCV.NXT
           receive next sequence number

   RCV.UP
           receive urgent pointer

   RCV.WND
           receive window

   receive next sequence number
           This is the next sequence number the local TCP is expecting
           to receive.

   receive window
           This represents the sequence numbers the local (receiving)
           TCP is willing to receive.  Thus, the local TCP considers
           that segments overlapping the range RCV.NXT to RCV.NXT +
           RCV.WND - 1 carry acceptable data or control.  Segments
           containing sequence numbers entirely outside of this range
           are considered duplicates and discarded.

   RST
           A control bit (reset), occupying no sequence space,
           indicating that the receiver should delete the connection
           without further interaction.  The receiver can determine,
           based on the sequence number and acknowledgment fields of the
           incoming segment, whether it should honor the reset command
           or ignore it.  In no case does receipt of a segment
           containing RST give rise to a RST in response.

   RTP
           Real Time Protocol: A host-to-host protocol for communication
           of time critical information.

   SEG.ACK
           segment acknowledgment

   SEG.LEN
           segment length

           A logical unit of data, in particular a TCP segment is the
           unit of data transfered between a pair of TCP modules.

   segment acknowledgment
           The sequence number in the acknowledgment field of the
           arriving segment.

   segment length
           The amount of sequence number space occupied by a segment,
           including any controls which occupy sequence space.

   segment sequence
           The number in the sequence field of the arriving segment.

   send sequence
           This is the next sequence number the local (sending) TCP will
           use on the connection.  It is initially selected from an
           initial sequence number curve (ISN) and is incremented for
           each octet of data or sequenced control transmitted.

   send window
           This represents the sequence numbers which the remote
           (receiving) TCP is willing to receive.  It is the value of
           the window field specified in segments from the remote (data
           receiving) TCP.  The range of new sequence numbers which may
           be emitted by a TCP lies between SND.NXT and SND.UNA +
           SND.WND - 1.  (Retransmissions of sequence numbers between
           SND.UNA and SND.NXT are expected, of course.)

   SND.NXT
           send sequence

   SND.UNA
           left sequence

   SND.UP
           send urgent pointer

   SND.WL1

           An address which specifically includes a port identifier,
           that is, the concatenation of an Internet Address with a TCP
           port.

   Source Address
           The source address, usually the network and host identifiers.

   SYN
           A control bit in the incoming segment, occupying one sequence
           number, used at the initiation of a connection, to indicate
           where the sequence numbering will start.

   TCB
           Transmission control block, the data structure that records
           the state of a connection.

   TCB.PRC
           The precedence of the connection.

   TCP
           Transmission Control Protocol: A host-to-host protocol for
           reliable communication in internetwork environments.

   TOS
           Type of Service, an Internet Protocol field.

   Type of Service
           An Internet Protocol field which indicates the type of
           service for this internet fragment.

   URG
           A control bit (urgent), occupying no sequence space, used to
           indicate that the receiving user should be notified to do
           urgent processing as long as there is data to be consumed
           with sequence numbers less than the value indicated in the
           urgent pointer.

   urgent pointer
           A control field meaningful only when the URG bit is on.  This
           field communicates the value of the urgent pointer which
           indicates the data octet associated with the sending user's
           urgent call.

4.  Changes from RFC 793

   TODO: this entire section will need to be edited and condensed before
   the document is finalized.  It currently represents a plan for future
   updates mixed with notes on what changes have already been completed.

   It should likely be an appendix, and in the final RFC, only the
   changes should be listed, and not what particular revision of the I-D
   they were made within.

   The -00 revision of this document was merely a proposal and rough
   plan for updating RFC 793.

   The -01 revision of this document incorporates the content of RFC 793
   Section 3 titled "FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATION".  Other content from RFC
   793 has not been incorporated.  The -01 revision of this document
   makes some minor formatting changes to the RFC 793 content in order
   to convert the content into XML2RFC format and account for left-out
   parts of RFC 793.  For instance, figure numbering differs and some
   indentation is not exactly the same.

   The -02 revision of this document incorporates errata that have been
   verified:

      Errata ID 573: Reported by Bob Braden (note: This errata basically
      is just a reminder that RFC 1122 updates 793.  Some of the
      associated changes are left pending to a separate revision that
      incorporates 1122.  Bob's mention of PUSH in 793 section 2.8 was
      not applicable here because that section was not part of the
      "functional specification" and the note on the urgent pointer will
      be revised when changes to account for RFC 6093 are incorporated.
      Also the 1122 text on the retransmission timeout also has been
      updated by subsequent RFCs, so the change here deviates from Bob's
      suggestion to apply the 1122 text.)
      Errata ID 574: Reported by Yin Shuming
      Errata ID 700: Reported by Yin Shuming
      Errata ID 701: Reported by Yin Shuming
      Errata ID 1283: Reported by Pei-chun Cheng

      Note: Some verified errata were not used in this update, as they
      relate to sections of RFC 793 elided from this document.  These
      include Errata ID 572, 575, and 1569.
      Note: Errata ID 3602 was not applied in this revision as it is
      duplicative of the 1122 corrections.
      There is an errata 3305 currently reported that need to be
      verified, held, or rejected by the ADs; it is addressing the same
      issue as draft-gont-tcpm-tcp-seq-validation and was not attempted
      to be applied to this document.

   Not related to RFC 793 content, this revision also makes small tweaks
   to the introductory text, fixes indentation of the pseudoheader
   diagram, and notes that the Security Considerations should also
   include privacy, when this section is written.

   TODO: Incomplete list of planned changes - these need to be added to
   and made more specific, as the document proceeds:

   1.   incorporate 1122 additions
   2.   point to major additional docs like 1323bis and 5681
   3.   incorporate relevant parts of 3168 (ECN)
   4.   incorporate 6093 (urgent pointer)
   5.   incorporate 6528 (sequence number)
   6.   incorporate Fernando's new number-checking fixes (if past the
        IESG in time)
   7.   point to PMTUD?
   8.   point to 5461 (soft errors)
   9.   mention 5961 state machine option
   10.  mention 6161 (reducing TIME-WAIT)
   11.  incorporate 6429 (ZWP/persist)
   12.  incorporate 6691 (MSS)

5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.  Existing IANA registries for
   TCP parameters are sufficient.

   TODO: check whether entries pointing to 793 and other documents
   obsoleted by this one should be updated to point to this one instead.

6.  Security and Privacy Considerations

   TODO

   Editor's Note: Scott Brim mentioned that this should include a
   PERPASS/privacy review.
