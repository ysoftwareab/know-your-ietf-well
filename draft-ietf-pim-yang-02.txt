1.  Introduction

   YANG [RFC6020] [RFC6087] is a data definition language that was
   introduced to model the configuration and running state of a device
   managed using NETCONF [RFC6241].  YANG is now also being used as a
   component of wider management interfaces, such as CLIs.

Internet-Draft                  PIM YANG                     August 2016


   This document defines a draft YANG data model that can be used to
   configure and manage Protocol-Independent Multicast (PIM) devices.
   Currently this model is incomplete, but it will support the core PIM
   protocol, as well as many other features mentioned in separate PIM
   RFCs.  Non-core features are defined as optional in the provided data
   model.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
   [RFC6020].

   This draft employs YANG tree diagrams, which are explained in
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc6087bis].

2.  Design of Data Model

2.1.  Scope of model

   The model covers PIM Sparse Mode [RFC4601], including the Source-
   Specfic subset [RFC3569], Dense Mode [RFC3973], and Bi-directional
   PIM [RFC5015].

   The PIM extensions represented in the model include BSR [RFC5059] and
   Anycast RP [RFC4610].

   The representation of some of these features is not completely
   specified in this draft of the data model.  This model is being
   circulated in its current form for early oversight and review of the
   basic hierarchy.

   The operational state fields and notifications of this model are also
   incomplete, though the structure of what has been written may be
   taken as representative of the structure of the model when complete.

   This model does not cover other multicast protocols such as IGMP/MLD,
   MSDP, mVPN, or m-LDP in-band signalling.  It does not cover any
   configuration required to generate the MRIB.  These will be covered
   by future Internet Drafts.

2.2.  Optional capabilities

   This model is designed to represent the capabilities of PIM devices
   with various specifications, including some with basic subsets of the
   PIM protocol.  The main design goals of this draft are that any major
   now-existing implementation may be said to support the base model,
   and that the configuration of all implementations meeting the
   specification is easy to express through some combination of the
   features in the base model and simple vendor augmentations.

   There is also value in widely-supported features being standardized,
   to save work for individual vendors, and so that mapping between
   different vendors' configuration is not needlessly complicated.
   Therefore these modules declare a number of features representing
   capabilities that not all deployed devices support.

   The extensive use of feature declarations should also substantially
   simplify the capability negotiation process for a vendor's PIM
   implementation.

   On the other hand, operational state parameters are not so widely
   designated as features, as there are many cases where the defaulting
   of an operational state parameter would not cause any harm to the
   system, and it is much more likely that an implementation without
   native support for a piece of operational state would be able to
   derive a suitable value for a state variable that is not natively
   supported.

   For the same reason, wide constant ranges (for example, timer maxima
   and minima) will be used in the model.  It is expected that vendors
   will augment the model with any specific restrictions that might be
   required.  Vendors may also extend the features list with proprietary
   extensions.

2.3.  Top-level structure

   This model defines several separate modules for modelling PIM
   configuration, defined below.  Again, this separation will make it
   easier to express the specific capabilities of a PIM device.

   The hierarchy of PIM configuration is designed so that objects that
   are only relevant for one situation or feature are collected in a
   container for that feature.  For example, the configuration for PIM-
   SM that is not relevant for an SSM-only implementation is collected
   in an ASM container.

   Where fields are not genuinely essential to protocol operation, they
   are marked as optional.  Some fields will be essential but have a
   default specified, so they need not be explicitly configured.

   This module structure also applies, where applicable, to the
   operational state and notifications of the model.

2.4.  Position of address family in hierarchy

   The current draft contains address-family as a node in the hierarchy
   multiple times: both under the interface list, and under the PIM
   instance.  This is similar to the IS-IS yang draft model.

   The reasoning for this is to make it easier for implementations in
   which configuration options are not supported for specific address
   families.

   For these implementations, the restriction that interface
   configuration must be address-family independent must either be
   expressed as a vendor augmentation of an address-family-independent
   parameter above the address-family level, or by a constraint on the
   base model objects of a form similar to:

   must ". = ../../address-family[address-family='ipv4']/
   interface[interface=current()/sibling:interface]/dr-priority" {
   error-app-tag dr-priority-mismatch; error-message "Error: IPv6 DR
   priority must match IPv4 DR priority "; }

3.  Unresolved Issues

3.1.  Current status of work in progress

   The model so far details how the PIM modules interact and covers the
   higher levels of their hierarchy.  Some details of interface
   configuration, RP configuration, and PIM-ASM-specific parameters are
   also complete.

   For a list of the most substantial areas still to cover, please see
   the "TODO list" section below.

3.2.  Group range mappings

   There is currently no convenient way in the operational state model
   to map from a group address to the PIM mode and RP information that
   it will be forwarded according to, which complicates reasoning about
   the running state and the diagnosis of conflicting policy
   configuration.

Internet-Draft                  PIM YANG                     August 2016


   A hypothetical group range state reporting object indexed by group
   range would be desirable for this purpose, but would be inconvenient
   for many implementations that index the relevant information on RP
   address (not applicable for DM or unroutable group-ranges), and
   difficult to express directly in YANG (as it is difficult to express
   a container indexed on an arbitrary, proprietary policy structure).

3.3.  Issues blocked on other model designers

   Some questions must be resolved with reference to other yang models,
   and so the resolution may be blocked on a decision from another body.
   Currently these issues are:

   1.  The position of BFD in the configuration; does the BFD model
       augment various different protocols, or do the protocols have to
       augment themselves individually to support BFD?

   2.  The abstract concepts of a "set of IP addresses" or "set of IP
       prefixes", as represented in implementations by prefixes, ACLs or
       policy statements, is a general concept out of the scope of this
       document.  It will presumably have a yang data-type the
       instantiation of which is vendor-specific.

4.  Module Structure

4.1.  PIM base module

   The PIM base module defines the router-wide configuration options not
   specific to any PIM mode, and is included by the other modules.
   There are a couple of things worth mentioning here regarding where
   the PIM model fits in the overall routing hierarchy:

   1.  Our current direction is to agree to a routing-instance-centric
       (VRF) model as opposed to protocol-centric mainly because it fits
       well into the routing-instance model, and it is easier to map
       from the VRF-centric to the protocol-centric than the other way
       around due to forward references.

   2.  The PIM base model will augment "/rt:routing/rt:routing-instance/
       rt:routing-protocols:" as opposed to augmenting "/rt:routing/
       rt:routing-instance/rt:routing-protocols:/rt:routing-protocol" as
       the latter would allow multiple protocol instances per VRF, which
       does not make sense for PIM.

4.2.  PIM RP module

   The PIM RP module contains configuration information scoped to RPs or
   ranges of group addresses.  This does not belong in the hierarchy
   under any PIM mode, but is augmented by the individual mode-specific
   modules as appropriate.

          module: ietf-pim-rp

6.  TODO list

   In this draft, several aspects of the model are incomplete.  The PIM-
   DM and BI-DIR modules are just placeholders for now to demonstrate
   the hierarchy of the model.  Other things the draft will include when
   complete but does not yet include:

   o  Interaction with BFD protocol

   o  Constraints (constant ranges, validation)

   o  State-limiting and policy

   o  Statistics.

   For these subjects, we will employ the same design principles of
   expressing a highly general model; vendors may use features and add
   augmentations in order to express which subsets of this general model
   are valid in their implementations.

7.  Security Considerations

   The data model defined does not introduce any security implications.

   This draft does not change any underlying security issues inherent in
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-routing-cfg].
