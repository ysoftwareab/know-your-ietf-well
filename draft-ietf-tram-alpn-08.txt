    Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) Labels for Session
               Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) Usages
                        draft-ietf-tram-alpn-08

Abstract

   Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) labels for Session
   Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) usages, such as Traversal Using
   Relays around NAT (TURN) and NAT discovery, are defined in this
   document to allow an application layer to negotiate STUN usages
   within the Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection.  ALPN protocol
   identifiers defined in this document apply to both TLS and Datagram
   Transport Layer Security (DTLS).

1.  Introduction

   STUN can be securely transported using TLS-over-TCP (referred to as
   TLS [RFC5246]), as specified in [RFC5389], or TLS-over-UDP (referred
   to as DTLS [RFC6347]), as specified in [RFC7350].

   ALPN [RFC7301] enables an endpoint to positively identify an
   application protocol in TLS/DTLS and distinguish it from other TLS/
   DTLS protocols.  With ALPN, the client sends the list of supported
   application protocols as part of the TLS/DTLS ClientHello message.
   The server chooses a protocol and sends the selected protocol as part
   of the TLS/DTLS ServerHello message.  Application protocol
   negotiation can thus be accomplished within the TLS/DTLS handshake,
   without adding network round-trips.

   STUN protocol usages, such as TURN [RFC5766], can be used to identify
   the purpose of a flow without initiating a session.

   This document proposes the following ALPN labels to identify STUN
   protocol [RFC5389] usages.

   'stun.turn':  Label to identify the specific use of STUN over (D)TLS
      for TURN (Section 4.6 of [RFC7350]).

   'stun.nat-discovery':  Label to identify the specific use of STUN
      over (D)TLS for NAT discovery (Section 4.1 of [RFC7350]).

2.  IANA Considerations

   The following entries are to be added to the "Application Layer
   Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) Protocol IDs" registry established by
   [RFC7301].

   The "stun.turn" label identifies the use of TURN usage (D)TLS:

      Protocol: Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN)

      Identification Sequence: 0x73 0x74 0x75 0x6E 0x2E 0x74 0x75 0x72
      0x6E ("stun.turn")

      Specification: This document (RFCXXXX)

   The "stun.nat-discovery" label identifies the use of STUN for the
   purposes of NAT discovery over (D)TLS:

      Protocol: NAT discovery using Session Traversal Utilities for NAT
      (STUN)

      Identification Sequence: 0x73 0x74 0x75 0x6E 0x2E 0x6e 0x61 0x74
      0x2d 0x64 0x69 0x73 0x63 0x6f 0x76 0x65 0x72 0x79 ("stun.nat-
      discovery")

      Specification: This document (RFCXXXX)

3.  Security Considerations

   The ALPN STUN protocol identifier does not introduce any specific
   security considerations beyond those detailed in the TLS ALPN
   Extension specification [RFC7301].  It also does not impact security
   of TLS/DTLS session establishment nor application data exchange.

4.  Acknowledgements
