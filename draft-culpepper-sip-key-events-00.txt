Abstract 
 
   This document defines a new SIP event package and presents a 
   framework for defining key event packages to be used by SIP network 
   entities for requesting and reporting state related to keys or 
   buttons.  The proposal currently defines key event packages to 
   represent telephone dial pads, feature buttons found on many 
   commercial telephones, standard keyboards as well as the framework 
   to support user or device specific buttons (for instance, a "Double 
   Latte" button).  The event package and associated key packages can 
   be used to enable new SIP services where an application or a SIP 
   entity requires user indications that are generated through key-
   based input which are common to many SIP communications endpoints.

1. Introduction 
    
   As stated in SIP-specific Event Notification [2], the SIP SUBSCRIBE 
   and NOTIFY methods provide a mechanism by which cooperating SIP [3] 
   endpoints can request and receive asynchronous notification of 
   changes in state related to network resources and calls.  This 
   mechanism, when combined with an event package for keys, can be used 
   for requesting and reporting the status of keys and keypads 
   associated with SIP user agents or indeed any SIP device. 
    
   Communication sessions many times are used as a means to access and 
   deliver services to users.  The operation and use of these services 
   almost always require some user interaction with the service.  One 
   of the primary means for user interactions with services when using 
   the legacy circuit-switched telecommunications network is via tones 
   generated as a result of a key press on the communications device.  
   While tones can be used in the same manner in IP networks, their 
   use, given the distributed nature of the network, is sub-optimal.  
   In addition, their use limits the user interface of many user 
   devices as well as the range of application services possible.  It 
   is for these reasons that a means to transport key presses is 
   needed. 
    
2. Motivation/Use Cases 
    
   The first and foremost motivation for this proposal is to extend the 
   possibility for user interaction beyond the antiquated telephone 
   dialpad model imposed by limiting interaction to DTMF tones.  The 
   proposal is designed to support full keyboards, multiple key 
   instances, user- or device-specific buttons (for instance, a "Double 
   Latte" button).  It also aims to provide an extensible framework to 
   allow volume controls, multi-position switches or any other user 
   interface widget to be defined in future Key Event Packages.  A 
   secondary goal of the proposal is that devices possessing a simple 
   user interface (such as telephone dialpad) need only implement a 
   smaller subset of the full proposal without losing any 
   interoperability with Application Servers (c.f., Section 10). 
    
   DTMF has been used in telephony networks as a means for users of 
   network services to provide input and some control of those 
   services.  DTMF is also used to signal connection destinations in 
   these networks.  This dual role of DTMF does not present problems in 
   circuit-switched networks.  However, with telecommunications move to 
   packet networks, separation of these roles is needed.  Packet 
   networks enable communications and related services to be deployed 
   in a distributed architecture.  An alternative to DTMF for "user 

 
Culpepper/Cuninghame/Mule                                      [Page 3] 

Internet Draft           SIP Key Events Package       December 19, 2001 

   input" is needed in order to better support the distributed 
   application architecture possible in IP networks. 
    
   Although a standard mechanism exists for the transport of DTMF in IP 
   networks, using it for user input and/or dynamic application control 
   as is done in the PSTN does not carry over into the IP network very 
   well.  Receiving tones via RTP is problematic for the 
   detector/generator devices in scenarios where multiple network 
   entities are interested in the events.  Replicating media to 
   multiple destinations is not a common feature of endpoints.  In 
   addition, the SDP session description to set up media replication is 
   more complicated than that required to set up typical multi-media 
   communications sessions. 
    
   The mechanism defined here can be used as an alternative to DTMF 
   detection when the detection of these tones is to gather input from 
   a user or provide some user application control independent of any 
   end-to-end media path.  The relationship of the mechanism described 
   in this specification to the transport of telephony tones via RTP 
   defined in RFC 2833 [4] is further described in Section 2.1. 
    
   It is intended that the event notification mechanism defined in this 
   document might be used in scenarios that have the following 
   attributes or requirements: 
    
   - The amount of data to be conveyed is very small compared to the 
     audio, video, text, etc. data in a session. 
   - Dynamic user control of applications is required. 
   - Collecting device input is needed when the device is not engaged 
     in a session. 
   - Security concerns exist due to multiplication attack possible with 
     DTMF forking. 
   - End-to-end security/privacy between caller and destination system 
     is required. 
   - Multiple Application Servers may be involved along the end-to-end 
     call path. 
   - Authentication and/or Privacy of key sequences between an 
     Application Server and an endpoint is desired. 
   - Reliable delivery of key sequences is required even when short 
     periods of network connectivity problems occur. 
   - Support for a device with a user interface consisting of more than 
     a simple keypad is required. 
    
   A network entity subscribing to key events at another network entity 
   may be interested in the events as they relate to an established 
   communications session or as they relate to the device itself.  Many 
   network-based communications services require the user to identify 
   themselves (for instance, by the user providing a PIN).  Pre-paid 
   and post-paid calling card services are a good example where a call-
   associated event subscription is useful.  Key event subscriptions 
   can also be useful outside of communications sessions.  For example, 
   an endpoint (SIP phone) may have a dedicated key used to 
   asynchronously invoke some function on a remote network entity.  In 
   this case, the remote network entity subscribes to key events at the 
 
Culpepper/Cuninghame/Mule                                      [Page 4] 

Internet Draft           SIP Key Events Package       December 19, 2001 

   SIP phone in a non-dialog specific manner.  When a key event of 
   interest occurs, the remote endpoint can act on the event.  RFC 2833 
   does not support notification of key events outside of the context 
   of an established session. 
    
2.1. Relation To Telephony Tones And Events 
    
   RFC 2833 defines an RTP payload format for telephony tones and 
   signals (including DTMF digits).  It allows the transport of such 
   events in the context of an established media session (in SIP, a 
   session must be established with media description in order for 
   endpoints to exchange RFC 2833 events or tones).  This mechanism has 
   several advantages: it is independent from any signaling protocol 
   and can be used with SIP, MGCP and other protocols, it eliminates 
   tone distortion, and it provides a reliable means for telephony 
   endpoints to exchange telephony tones within RTP media flows. 
    
   The purpose of the current document is to provide a general 
   mechanism for SIP entities to request and report the notifications 
   of key events (including keys in keypads or any kind of keyboards).  
   This mechanism is specific to the SIP protocol and is based on SIP 
   events.  It offers several advantages: 
    
   - SIP application servers not involved in the media path can now 
     request and receive key state changes. 
   - SIP entities supporting SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY now have a generic 
     mechanism to exchange key states. 
   - It allows multiple SIP application servers to receive independent 
     key event notification with each application server only receiving 
     notifications for the key-events that it is interested in. 
    
   In conclusion, this mechanism can be used in conjunction with RFC 
   2833 or it can also serve as an alternative to RFC 2833 in the cases 
   where: 
    
   - Key states beyond telephony tones and signals are desired. 
   - A means for simple SIP telephony applications such as software 
     phones or applications, not necessarily able to generate telephony 
     tones, is needed to interact with applications. 
   - IP telephony gateways wish to conserve DSP resources. 
   - Supporting RFC 2833 for the sole purpose of indicating key 
     presses, or supporting the duplication of RFC 2833 RTP payload 
     events to the signaling planes, is not desirable. 
    
2.2. Example Usage Scenarios 
    
   As discussed in the previous section, the scenarios described in 
   this section do not preclude the presence of tone data associated 
   with a telephone keypad.  Specifically, RFC 2833 may still be 
   employed as an end-to-end media-layer transport mechanism for DTMF 
   tones, that is, as an end-to-end transport mechanism between the 
   caller and destination User Agent.

2.2.1. Example 1: Application Server acting as B2BUA/3pcc 
    
   In this example the Application Server (AS) will generate the INVITE 
   and BYE requests to perform call control.  Due to the nature of this 
   model, the AS can always inherently ensure that it remains on the 
   call path for the duration of the session.  The general B2BUA 
   network model is shown in Figure 1. 
    
     Caller                   AS                    Callee 
   +--------+             +---------+             +--------+ 
   |  UAC   |<--- SIP --->| UAS/UAC |<--- SIP --->|  UAS   | 
   +--------+             +---------+             +--------+ 
        |                                              | 
        +-------------------- RTP ---------------------+ 
    
   Figure 1.  Application Server (B2BUA/3pcc) Model 
 
   The above figure depicts a caller establishing a session with the 
   AS, after which the AS establishes a session with the callee.  The 
   AS provides one endpoint∆s session description to the other 
   endpoint.  This results in the media being exchanged between the two 
   endpoints and the SIP signaling occurring between the AS and each 
   endpoint. 
    
   In this scenario, it is desired for the caller and callee to be able 
   to invoke application services & features by pressing keys on the 
   terminal.  The action required by the AS is simple: it sends a 
   SUBSCRIBE to the caller∆s and/or callee∆s User-Agent as described in 
   section 7.3.  The subscription request should be dialog specific.  
   Now the Application Server will receive all endpoint Key Events for 
   the duration of the subscription. 
    
   If support for multiple Application Servers is desired when using 
   this model, or the caller or callee wishes to subscribe to key 
   events, then the AS will have to act as a proxy (or B2BUA) to 
   forward received SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY requests between the subscriber 
   and the actual User Agent endpoint.  Unless the AS is acting as a 
   transparent B2BUA, dialog references within SUBSCRIBE requests (in 
   this instance the Applies-To header [c.f., Appendix A]) will also 
   need to be modified to remain correct. 
    
   This model can introduce re-INVITE glare conditions when multiple 
   Application Servers are involved in a session where a key sequence 
   invokes some session modification function at multiple Application 
   Servers.  Re-INVITE glare is not a problem specific to this document 
   and is only one consideration of the more general problem of 
   "Multiple AS Interaction".

2.2.2. Example 2: Application Server Acting As A Proxy. 
    
   In this scenario, the Application Server normally functions as a SIP 
   proxy.  The application is co-located with the SIP proxy and may 
   also function as a SIP UA if desired.  The network model is shown in 
   Figure 2 below. 
    
    Caller               AS                  AS                Callee 
   +------+           +-------+           +-------+           +------+ 
   | UAC  |<-- SIP -->| Proxy |<-- SIP -->| Proxy |<-- SIP -->| UAS  | 
   +------+           +-------+           +-------+           +------+ 
      |                                                          | 
      +--------------------------- RTP --------------------------+ 
    
   Figure 2.  Application Server (Proxy) Model 
    
   Any proxy that wants to stay in the signaling path inserts a Record-
   Route header into the session establishment request.  The Record-
   Route mechanism will ensure the Proxy/AS sees all SIP requests and 
   responses for the dialog established between the caller and callee.  
   Applications deployed using this model do not manage user sessions 
   as a user agent but rather exert call-control over the INVITE dialog 
   and/or conversation space [5] using, for instance, the call control 
   primitives and framework defined in [5] or using some other external 
   mechanism. 
    
   In this usage example the Application Server desires to take action 
   after a certain sequence of key events occurs during a session.  So 
   after possibly record-routing the caller∆s initial INVITE request 
   and forwarding it to the destination system, the AS will send a 
   dialog specific subscription request to the desired User-Agents as 
   described in Section 3.1 (and as for example 1).  This allows any 
   and all SIP proxies/AS in the signaling path to receive key-event 
   notifications independently of any other SIP proxy/AS. 
    
2.3. SIP Call-Control Interaction 
 
   The Key Event Package allows multiple network entities to subscribe 
   to key events for the same SIP session on the same device.  Due to 
   this fact, it is possible for multiple Application Servers to take 
   part in the same call and thus the interaction between the servers 
   must be considered. 
    
   However, solving the problems of multiple AS interaction is beyond 
   the scope of this document.  This document simply defines a 
   mechanism whereby Applications can monitor key events on a network 
   device - it is does not specify the call-control mechanisms used by 
   participating entities.  Different call control models will have 
   different interaction characteristics.

3. Subscription to Key Events 
    
   Subscriptions to key events are established, maintained, and 
   terminated as described in the SIP-Specific Event Notification 
   framework specification [2].  Key event subscriptions are indicated 
   with the appropriate value in the Event header of SUBSCRIBE and 
   NOTIFY requests.  Details of the events being subscribed to, and 
   being reported are specified in message body of the request.  (See 
   sections 5 and 6 for normative descriptions of key events and their 
   message bodies.) 
    
   As specified later, SUBSCRIBE requests contain message bodies that 
   indicate the events being subscribed to.  Once accepted, an "event 
   notification dialog" is established and event state is established 
   in the notifier according to the contents of the SUBSCRIBE message 
   body.  It is possible to modify the set of events being subscribed 
   to by sending another SUBSCRIBE request, with a key events message 
   body, for a previously established event notification dialog.  In 
   this case, the new message body should replace the state established 
   by a previous SUBSCRIBE. 
    
   This document describes two types of key event subscriptions.  The 
   first is a subscription associated with a SIP dialog or conversation 
   space.  That is, the subscription is only valid for key-events 
   directly associated with the session and the subscription ends when 
   the SIP dialog or conversation-space ceases to exist.  The term 
   "dialog specific subscription" will be used to describe this type of 
   subscription.  The second type of key event subscription described 
   here is a non-dialog associated subscription.  Where the subscribing 
   device is interested in key events regardless of what the device is 
   doing.  The term "non-dialog specific subscription" will be used to 
   describe this second type of key event subscription.  Devices 
   supporting the mechanisms defined in this document MUST support 
   dialog specific subscriptions.  Support for non-dialog specific 
   subscriptions is OPTIONAL. 
    
3.1. Dialog Specific Subscriptions 
    
   A dialog specific subscription is requested by the subscriber by 
   including the Applies-To message header defined in Appendix A.  It 
   is hoped that this mechanism is eventually incorporated into the SIP 
   Events draft [2].  Some aspects of this type of subscription are 
   clarified below: 
    
3.1.1. Multi-dialog Capable Endpoints 
    
   Dialog specific subscriptions can present a challenge to user 
   devices that support multiple simultaneous dialogs but only have a 
   single user interface (keypad, speaker, microphone) that is shared 
   between all session (e.g., a multi-line SIP phone).  Most devices of 
   this type have the concept of a single "active" session among the 
 
Culpepper/Cuninghame/Mule                                      [Page 8] 

Internet Draft           SIP Key Events Package       December 19, 2001 

   established sessions.  That is, only one session has the use of the 
   shared user interface resources at any point in time.  This 
   characteristic should be applied to key event subscriptions, in 
   other words, notifications will only be sent to subscribers (if any) 
   of the dialog with which the keypad is assigned to at the time of 
   the event detection.  This behavior is consistent with common 
   circuit-based multi-line telephones. 
    
   This should not be confused with devices which terminate multiple 
   dialogs but where each dialog is associated with a different user, 
   for instance, a SIP-PSTN gateway. 
    
3.1.2. "Early" Dialog Subscriptions 
    
   In order for a subscriber to reliably receive all Callee generated 
   key-events from the time a session is fully established/answered, a 
   Callee must be able to receive and setup a dialog specific 
   subscription prior to the associated dialog being fully established.  
   This is accomplished by the caller/AS sending a SUBSCRIBE request 
   after an early dialog has been established (by a provisional INVITE 
   response) but before any final response has been sent by the callee.  
   As with any SUBSCRIBE request received, recipients should process 
   the request according to its policies, however early dialog 
   subscriptions do not produce Key-Event information until the 
   associated dialog is established/answered.  It should be remembered 
   that the SIP Events draft requires that a NOTIFY request is 
   generated immediately, however, the NOTIFY will simply not contain 
   Key-Event message bodies until the subscription∆s associated device 
   or dialog becomes active (as explained in Section 6). 
    
   A Caller can also receive a dialog specific subscription for a 
   dialog before it has been fully established.  The same issues with 
   authentication and authorization apply as in the previous case, 
   however, the notification of caller key presses before the dialog is 
   fully established may benefit certain applications (for instance, 
   pre-answer or pre-alerting caller pin-code authorization).  Thus, 
   when the Applies-To header does not specify a remote tag the early 
   subscription should become active immediately.  If the subscriber 
   does specify a remote tag in the Applies-To header, then the 
   subscription is only valid while the caller has an end-to-end 
   association with the specified callee (for instance while early 
   media from the specified callee is being played to the caller).  In 
   this case, the subscription is terminated if and when the session is 
   eventually established with a different callee. 
    
3.1.3. Multiple Subscriptions 
    
   A User-Agent/Notifier MUST support multiple subscriptions for the

   subscribers.

Internet Draft           SIP Key Events Package       December 19, 2001 

   Key events subscriptions that apply to a device, regardless of any 
   on-going or active SIP dialogs, are established by SUBSCRIBE 
   requests that do not include an Applies-To header.  Notifiers that 
   support non-dialog specific subscriptions MUST support multiple 
   subscriptions from the same or different subscribers. 
    
    
4. Key-Event Framework and Representation 
    
   The "key-event" SIP Event Package does not in itself define any 
   events but rather defines the framework for "Key-Event Sub-Packages" 
   (which should not be confused with SIP Event Packages or Sub-
   Packages).  Each Key-Event Sub-Package defines the key-events that 
   make up the sub-package along with the states and properties that 
   the constituent key-events may possess. 
    
   The use of SIP Event Sub-Packages (as defined in [2]) with the Key-
   Event SIP Event Package is not currently defined and SUBSCRIBE 
   requests for unknown SIP Event Sub-Packages (for instance, "Event: 
   key-event.mysubpackage") SHOULD be rejected with a 489 Bad Event 
   response. 
 
4.1. Key-Event Sub-Package Components 
    
   All Key-Event Sub-Package definitions consist of the following 
   elements. 
    
   Sub-Package Name: The name of the sub-package as used in messages. 
    
   Key-Event Values: This list defines the set of valid key-events of 
   the sub-package.  A key-event can have either a numeric value (e.g., 
   49) or a non-numeric value (e.g., shift). 
    
   Key-Event States: This component defines the set of states that key-
   events in the sub-package can have (e.g., keyup or keydown).  The 
   sub-package must also define a default state. 
    
   Key-Event Properties: This list defines any configurable or 
   retrievable properties held by the key-events.  Support for any 
   particular sub-package property is NOT REQUIRED unless explicitly 
   stated in the sub-package description. 
    
   Enumerated Key-Event Sets: In order to simplify subscription, the 
   sub-package can define a number of enumerated key-event sets.  These 
   enumerations are entirely equivalent to the set of key-events they 
   represent (e.g., @dialpad = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, * and 
   #} found on common telephones). 
    
   By design, all key-events in a sub-package share the same states and 
   properties.  The actual sub-packages are defined in Section 5. 
    
4.2. Key Representations

Internet Draft           SIP Key Events Package       December 19, 2001 

   The representation of keys in the "key-event" event package has been 
   designed around a few central philosophies. 
    
   Firstly, all keys that represent the same information must map to 
   the same key-event.  For instance, a key representing "1" on a 
   keyboard, keypad, telephone, or vending machine will all map to the 
   same key event; likewise, multiple equivalent keys (e.g., left and 
   right shift keys) will also map to the same key-event.  The key-
   event package does however allow an optional positional indicator to 
   indicate the origin of a particular key event (if multiple 
   equivalent keys are present).  The value can be ignored if desired.  
   This arrangement avoids the situation where an application must 
   observe a (possibly unknown) set of equivalent key events. 
    
   The positional indicator values currently defined are "alt" 
   (alternate) & "keypad" as well as the assumed "pri" (primary) key 
   position.  When a keyboard has two or more equivalent keys, one is 
   always defined to be the primary key and the others are defined to 
   be the alternate/keypad positions.  For Shift, Ctrl, Alt and similar 
   equivalent keys, the bottom-left most key is defined to be the 
   primary key.  If a device has only one instance of a particular key 
   it is always regarded as the primary key regardless of its physical 
   position. 
    
   The second design philosophy is that the event package is 
   independent of key-cap arrangements on keyboards.  A keyboard is 
   represented by two distinct sub-packages: one sub-package represents 
   all characters that are accessible on the keyboard, the second sub-
   package represents all non-character based keys, for instance, 
   Shift, Caps Lock, Insert, Up, Alt, Pause.  [For historical reasons 
   Backspace, Delete, Enter/Carriage-Return & Escape have character 
   representations.]  This, for example, means that the representation 
   of capital Q (i.e., 'Q') is independent of the Shift key event. 
    
   Lastly, all basic keys were designed to have two possible states: up 
   or down.  Key presses are signaled by notifying the subscriber when 
   a key transitions into a new state ("keyup" or "keydown" state 
   events).  Each state notification is accompanied by state specific 
   information such as key depression start time.  The key-event 
   package states have been arranged such that a "keyup" state event 
   includes both key release event time as well as duration of the 
   depression. 
    
   This arrangement allows the "keydown" state event to be seamlessly 
   delayed or omitted by the notifier and/or ignored by the subscriber.  
   The role of the "keydown" event is to provide rapid notification of 
   key depression.  For many applications, the "keydown" event 
   notification is only useful for prolonged key depressions.  The key-
   event package provides a useful mechanism whereby a subscriber 
   application can delay "keydown" notifications to achieve a 
   compromise between key response times and reduced bandwidth (2 SIP 
   messages verse 4 SIP messages per key depression and release).

5. Key-Event Sub-package Definitions 
    
   This section defines the Sub-Packages for the Key-Event Package.  
   All header and grammar references refer to the "application/key-
   event" message bodies defined in Section 6. 
    
5.1. Shared Key-Event States and Properties 
    
   All currently defined sub-packages in this document share the 
   following state and property definitions. 
    
   These definitions have been grouped together for clarity however the 
   definitions still belong to the individual Key-Event Sub-Packages 
   and not to Key-Event Package as a whole.  Future sub-packages may 
   define additional states and/or properties; future sub-packages are 
   also not forced to use existing key-event states and properties if 
   they do not make sense within a new sub-package (e.g., for a 
   slider/dimmer control). (c.f., Section 11 for further guidelines.) 
    
   Key-Event States: 
    
  - "keydown" 
     State Parameters: 
        * Start Time of Key Depression: Milliseconds offset from the 
          event-time NTP value specified in the Time-header.  Negative 
          values are allowed. 
 
  - "keyup" 
     State Parameters: 
        * Time of Key Release: Milliseconds offset from the event-time 
          NTP value specified in the Time-header.  Negative values are 
          allowed. 
        * Duration of Key Depression: Millisecond duration of key 
          depression. 
 
  Key-Event Properties: 
    
  - "exists" 
     SUBSCRIBE Parameters: none 
     NOTIFY Result: positional-indicator *( "," positional-indicator )  
                   [List of non-primary key instances.] 
     Default value: N/A 
     Support: RECOMMENDED 
     Description: Determines which non-primary key-events exist. 
          e.g., "p: key[49].exists()" may yield a result of  
          "p: key[49].exists(keypad)" which indicate that two '1' keys 
          exists: a primary key instance and a keypad key instance.   
          Note: This property only produces a result for key-events 
          possessing non-primary key positions. 
    
  - "name" 
     SUBSCRIBE Parameters: none

Internet Draft           SIP Key Events Package       December 19, 2001 

     NOTIFY Result: positional-indicator "=" quoted-string 
                    *( "," positional-indicator "=" quoted-string )  
                    [Lists of names for all key instances.] 
     Default value: N/A 
     Support: RECOMMENDED 
     Description:  
          The property when requested (e.g., "p: keybd[49].name()" ) 
          returns the printable name of the key-event in the NOTIFY 
          result (e.g., "key[49].name(pri="1", keypad="Keypad 1")" ). 
          The description should be sufficiently detailed such that a 
          user would be able to identify the key from the description.  
          This property can also very useful when the name of the key 
          is configured locally, for instance, a SUBSCRIBE request for 
          "phone[line:*].name()" could conceivably yield a result of 
          "phone[line:1].name(pri="Reception")". 
      
  - "dwndly": (DownDelay) 
     SUBSCRIBE Parameters: 1*DIGIT (milliseconds delay) 
     NOTIFY Result: 1*DIGIT (milliseconds delay) 
     Default value: 0 
     Support: OPTIONAL 
          Description: Milliseconds delay that notifier should/will 
          wait before generating a "keydown" state event after a key is 
          depressed.  If the key is raised before this duration elapses 
          then only the "keyup" state event will be generated.  This 
          allows a tradeoff between key responsiveness (for longer 
          keypresses) and the number of NOTIFY message exchanges per 
          keypress.  The NOTIFY result contains a confirmation of the 
          new value. 
          This value (and any change thereof) is local to the 
          subscription in which it is requested. 
    
5.2. Key Sub-package 
    
   Sub-Package Name: "key" 
    
   Key-Event Values: Decimal Unicode values [7]. 
    
   Key-Event States: keydown, keyup (default) 
    
   Key-Event Properties: name, exists, dwndly 
    
   Enumerated Key Event Sets: 
     - "@dialpad" = "35,42,48-57" 
          This set represents a standard telephone dialpad: 0-9, *, #. 
     - "@uslatin" = "9-10,32-126" 
          This set represents the printable and white space character 
          key set found on a typical US keyboard (which is a subset of 
          most other keyboards). 
     - "@uslatin2" = "8-10,27,32-127" 
          This set is similar to @uslatin but also includes the non-
          printable backspace, delete & escape keyboard characters (see 
          notes below).

   Notes: 
          For mainly historical reasons, the following keys belong to 
          the key sub-package rather than the keybd sub-package: 
            - Backspace: 8 
            - Tab: 9 
            - Enter: (treated as unix '\n') 10

          + Key-events of the form "keyname:*" allow for multiple 
          numbered keys to exist.  These key-events must be always be 
          used in this numbered key form (e.g., "func:3"). 
    
   Notes:  
          The names provided for the Key-Event Values should be only 
          regarded as examples.  The actual Key Event Name should be 
          sufficient to locate the individual key on the device 
          (including the case when there are multiple key instances).

          Notes: The state of this button is actually the opposite of 
          the hook switch, that is, the "keyup" state represents the 
          on-hook condition.  Normally this key-event would only be 
          available in non-dialog specific subscriptions.

6. Key-Event Message Body Format 
    
   A Key-Event SUBSCRIBE or NOTIFY request message body consists of a 
   set of UTF8 header lines.  The header lines resemble HTTP header 
   formats however for efficiency all header, sub-package, property, 
   state and key-event names are case-sensitive and multiple headers of 
   the same type are not permitted.  Parsers MUST be tolerant of spaces 
   between header tokens.  The new MIME type for this message body 
   format is "application/key-event". 
    
   key-event-message = time-header CRLF 
                       [ event-header CRLF ] 
                       [ properties-header CRLF ] 
                       [ state-header CRLF ] 
                       [ future-extension-header CRLF ] 
    
   The key-event headers may appear in SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY request 
   message bodies as detailed in the following table: 
    
   Key-Event Header          Where    SUB NOT(initial) NOT(update) 
   ----------------          -----    --- ---          --- 
   Time-Header (t:)            B       m   m            m 
   Event-Header (e:)           B       m   m            - 
   Properties-Header (p:)      B       o   o            - 
   State-Header (s:)           B       -   o            m 
    
   B indicates that the Key-Event header is valid in the message body 
   of a request. 
    
   The above "NOTIFY(initial)" description refers to the fact that the 
   NOTIFY request is generated in response to a SUBSCRIBE request and 
   carries initial state information - it does not refer simply to the 
   first NOTIFY sent in a subscription.  This is further described in 
   Section 7.7. 
    
6.1. Time-Header Format 
    
   The time-header indicates the NTP time [6] that the event message 
   was first issued and a message sequence number. 
    
   The exact starting/ending time of an event often requires greater 
   granularity than is provided by NTP values (in seconds) and so key-
   event state transitions also include a millisecond offset that is 
   added to this NTP time value.  It must also be remembered that the 
   time a key-event message is generated may not always be the same as 
   the time of the actual key-event event (for instance, initial state 
   indications). 
    
   The sequence number allows the key-event message bodies to be 
   sequenced independently of the application protocol. 
    
   time-header = "t" ":" event-time sequence-number 
   event-time = 1*DIGIT 
 
Culpepper/Cuninghame/Mule                                     [Page 16] 

Internet Draft           SIP Key Events Package       December 19, 2001 

   sequence-number = 1*DIGIT 
    
   The event-time is set equal to the NTP time value when the message 
   body was first issued.  The sequence-number is a 32-bit non-zero 
   integer that is incremented each time a new Key-Event SUBSCRIBE or 
   NOTIFY message body is generated within the each subscription.  The 
   sequence number spaces for the subscriber and notifier are 
   independent. 
    
   Examples: 
    
   t: 36539655 1 
    
6.2. Event-Header Format 
    
   The event-header allows the subscriber to request a set of key-
   events and the notifier to confirm/indicate the set of key-events 
   subscribed/supported. 
    
   The event-header in a SUBSCRIBE request body is used to request a 
   subscription to a set of key events.  The event header in a NOTIFY 
   request body is used to indicate the actual set of subscribed key 
   events. 
    
   event-header = "e" ":" [ ( event-set ( "," event-set ) ) | "*" ] 
   event-set = sub-package-name [ key-event-list ] 
   sub-package-name = token 
   key-event-list = "[" key-event-set *( "," key-event-set ) "]" 
   key-event-set = key-event-identifier | key-event-range | 
                   enumerated-key-event-set 
   key-event-identifier = key-event-name | key-event-value | 
                          key-event-numid | key-event-numidwild 
   key-event-name = token 
   key-event-value = 1*DIGIT 
   key-event-numid = token ":" 1*DIGIT 
   key-event-numidwild = token ":" "*" 
   key-event-range = ( key-event-value "-" key-event-value ) | 
                     ( key-event-numid "-" key-event-numid ) 
   enumerated-key-event-set = "@" token 
    
   If the key-event-list is not present in a SUBSCRIBE request message 
   body (e.g., "e: key") then it is assumed that the subscriber wants 
   to be notified of all available key-events in the sub-package.  The 
   key-event-list MUST always be present in NOTIFY requests and 
   indicates all key-events that are subscribed (e.g., e: key[48-57]). 
    
   Likewise, the "*" wildcard can only appear in SUBSCRIBE request 
   message bodies.  Wildcards must be expanded in NOTIFY requests as 
   described in Section 7.7.1. 
    
   Key-event-ranges with numbered keys (e.g, a "Line 3" telephone 
   button) must have the same key-event type on both sides of the range

   (e.g., "phone[line:1-line:10]").  Each numbered key is treated as an 
   independent key-event. 
    
   An empty event-header ("e:") in a NOTIFY request body indicates that 
   no events are subscribed and it is RECOMMENDED that the NOTIFY 
   request also includes an "Expires: 0" in the SIP header.  The event-
   header is the only key-event header which may be present but empty. 
    
   Example Key-Event SUBSCRIBE request message body headers: 
    
   e: key[@dialpad, 65-68], keybd 
    
     In this example, the subscriber is requesting event notification 
     for keys: 0-9, *, #, A, B, C, D from the key sub-package and all 
     supported keybd sub-package events. 
    
   e: *         
    
     In this example the subscriber is requesting a subscription to all 
     key-events supported by the notifier. 
    
   e: phone[line:*] 
    
     In this example the subscriber is requesting all available "line" 
     buttons within the phone sub-package. 
    
   Example Key-Event NOTIFY request body headers for the above 
   SUBSCRIBE message body headers: 
    
   e: key[@dialpad]  
           
     In this example the notifier is indicating that subscription only 
     occurred for the key-events 0-9,*,#. 
    
   e: key[48-57,8,10], keybd[insert,numlk] 
           
     In this example, the notifier is indicating that subscriptions 
     have been created for the key-events 0-9, Backspace, Enter, Insert 
     & NumLock. 
    
   e: phone[line:1-line:5] 
    
     In this example, the notifier is indicating that subscriptions 
     have been created for the "line" buttons 1 through 5. 
    
6.3. Properties-Header Format 
    
   The properties-header in a SUBSCRIBE request body is used to set or 
   retrieve the properties of subscribed key-events.  The properties- 
   header in a NOTIFY request body indicates the value of each of the 
   listed properties. 
    
   properties-header = "p" ":" properties-set *( "," properties-set )

   properties-set = ( event-set | "*" ) "." property-name  
                    "(" [ parameter-list ] ")" 
   property-name = token 
   parameter-list = parameter *( "," parameter ) 
   parameter = *( ";" | "/" | "?" | ":" | "@" | "&" | "=" | "+" 
               | "$" | unreserved | escaped | quoted-string ) 
    
   As with the event-header, "*" wildcards and empty key-event-list∆s 
   can only appear in SUBSCRIBE requests.  Wildcards and key-event-
   list∆s must be expanded in NOTIFY requests as described in Section 
   5.2. 
    
   NOTE: The set of key-events that each property operates on is always 
   equal to the intersection of the set of subscribed key-events and 
   the set of key-events requested in the properties-header. 
    
   Examples for SUBSCRIBE request message body headers:  
    
   [see Section 8 for the actual description and definition of the 
   properties used in these examples] 
    
   p: key.dwndly(500)          
    
     In this example the subscriber is requesting that a value of 500 
     is assigned to the "dwndly" property of all subscribed "key" sub-
     package key-events. 
    
   p: *.exists()               
    
     In this example the subscriber is requesting to know the existence 
     of all non-primary key instances for all subscribed key-events. 
    
   p: keybd[ctrl].name()       
    
     The subscriber is requesting the name of all ctrl key instances. 
    
   Example NOTIFY request body headers for above SUBSCRIBE examples: 
    
   p: key[@dialpad].dwndly(500) 
    
     In response to the above dwndly set request, the notifier is 
     confirming the new value for all subscribed key-events in the key 
     sub-package. 
    
   p: key[47-58, 10].exists(keypad) 
    
     The notifier is indicating that in addition to the primary 
     instances of all subscribed key-events, additional key instances 
     for 0-9 & Enter exist on a keypad. 
    
   p: keybd[ctrl].name(pri="Left Control", alt="Right Control")

Internet Draft           SIP Key Events Package       December 19, 2001 

     In this example, the name property indicates the names for the 
     various control key instances possessed by the device. 
    
6.4. State-Header Format 
    
   The state-header allows the notifier to indicate the initial key-
   event states and subsequent key-event state changes.  The header 
   only appears in NOTIFY requests. 
    
   state-header = "s" ":" state-indication *( "," state-indication ) 
   state-indication = event-descriptor "." state-name 
                      "(" [ parameter-list ] ")" 
   event-descriptor = sub-package-name "[" key-event-descriptor "]" 
   key-event-descriptor = ( key-event-name | key-event-value | 
                          key-event-numid ) 
                          [ "(" positional-indicator ")" ] 
   positional-indicator = "pri" | "alt" | "keypad" | token 
   state-name = token  
    
   An empty positional-indicator infers the request/result applies to 
   the primary key of this key-event type. 
    
   Examples: 
    
   s: key[49].keydown(-1532)   
    
     This example is a keydown state indication for the primary '1' key 
     (Unicode [7] value 49).  It indicates that the button was first 
     depressed 1532 milliseconds before the NTP value in the time-
     header. 
    
   s: key[49(keypad)].keyup(126,1206)              
    
     This example is a keyup state indication for the keypad '1' key.  
     It also indicates that the button was released 126 milliseconds 
     after the NTP value in the time-header and was depressed for 1206 
     milliseconds. 
    
    
7. Event Package Definition 
    
   This section contains the formal definition of the Key-events SIP 
   Event Package described in this document.  This information is 
   provided to conform to the requirements for SIP Event Packages as 
   outlined in [2].  As part of these requirements this section details 
   how Key-Event message bodies are generated by the subscriber and 
   notifier entities. 
    
7.1. Event Package Name 
    
   The event package token name for the Key Events package is "key-
   event".  The token name is used in the Event and Allow-Event headers 
   defined in [2]. 
 
Culpepper/Cuninghame/Mule                                     [Page 20] 

Internet Draft           SIP Key Events Package       December 19, 2001 

    
7.2. Event Package Parameters 
    
   There are no parameters used in the Event header for the key-events 
   package/sub-packages. 
    
7.3. SUBSCRIBE Bodies 
    
   SUBSCRIBE requests for Key-Event subscriptions MUST contain a Key-
   Event message body if the SIP Expires header value is non-zero.  
   SUBSCRIBE responses do not contain a message body.  The Content-Type 
   for the Key-Event message body is "application/key-event".  The 
   grammatical specifications for the message body are defined in 
   section 6. 
    
7.4. Subscription Duration 
    
   Dialog specific subscriptions implicitly end when the associated 
   dialog or conversation-space ends.  Please refer to Appendix A.2 & 
   A.3 for recommended dialog specific subscription expiry timeout 
   values.  It is recommended that the subscription expiry timeout for 
   non-dialog specific subscriptions be from a few minutes to an hour. 
    
   As detailed in [2] a SUBSCRIBE with an "Expires: 0" header indicates 
   the termination of a subscription.  However, if the accepted 
   SUBSCRIBE message also contains a key-event message body, then the 
   SUBSCRIBE message body should be processed and the normal NOTIFY 
   message body is generated (ignoring any persistent subscription side 
   effects).  This mechanism can be used to determine the sub-packages 
   & key-events supported as well as the current property values 
   without creating an ongoing subscription. 
    
   If the terminating SUBSCRIBE does not contain a Key-Event message 
   body then a NOTIFY request MUST still be sent (with no message body) 
   as described in [2]. 
    
7.5. NOTIFY Bodies 
    
   NOTIFY requests MUST contain a Key-Event message body if the 
   associated device, dialog or conversation space of the subscription 
   is in an active state.  Conversely, the lack of a message body in a 
   NOTIFY request with a non-zero Subscription-Expires header value 
   indicates that the Key-Event subscription state is pending (for 
   example, awaiting authorization or for the associated dialog to 
   become active).  NOTIFY responses do not contain a message body.  
   The Content-Type for the Key-Event message body is "application/key-
   event".  The grammatical specifications for the message body are 
   defined in section 6. 
    
7.6. Notifier Processing of SUBSCRIBE Requests 
    
   The notifier takes the following basic steps: 
    
 
Culpepper/Cuninghame/Mule                                     [Page 21] 

Internet Draft           SIP Key Events Package       December 19, 2001 

   1. Before processing a received SUBSCRIBE request a state-agent MUST 
   check that the subscriber is authorized to perform the requested 
   subscription (c.f., Section 9 and [2]). 
    
   2. If the SUBSCRIBE includes an Applies-To header then the notifier 
   MUST check that the dialog exists and if not, take action as 
   described in Appendix A. 
    
   3. The SUBSCRIBE message body is parsed for consistency and a 
   SUBSCRIBE response is generated as described in [2]. 
    
   4. The state-agent will then clear existing Key-Event subscription 
   state for this subscription and proceed to generate an Initial 
   NOTIFY request and subscription state as described in Section 7.7.1. 
    
   5. If the value of the SUBSCRIBE∆s Expires header is non-zero then 
   the new subscription state information is stored. 
    
7.7. Notifier Generation of NOTIFY Requests 
    
   This section describes both the generation of NOTIFY requests when 
   the subscription is established or modified by the notifier, and 
   when reporting state changes in the subscribed resource. 
    
7.7.1. Generating Initial NOTIFY Requests 
    
   The Initial NOTIFY contains complete state information.  It can be 
   differentiated from a NOTIFY reporting a change in state by the 
   presence of the event-header in the Key-Event message body.  The 
   initial NOTIFY request is generated in response to an accepted 
   SUBSCRIBE request containing a Key-Event message body (although it 
   need not be generated immediately). 
    
   Generating the Initial NOTIFY request is the most complicated part 
   of this specification, however, the headers were constructed so that 
   the event-, property- and state- headers have a similar syntax and 
   semantics. 
    
   If the SUBSCRIBE request did not contain a Key-Eevent message body 
   (which infers that the request also has an "Expires: 0" header) then 
   the resulting NOTIFY request will also not have a Key-Event message 
   body.  If the SUBSCRIBE request does contain a Key-Event message 
   body but has a "Expires: 0" SIP header then an Initial NOTIFY 
   request is still generated however the subscription is not kept 
   after the Initial NOTIFY request is sent.  Otherwise, the Initial 
   NOTIFY message body contains the following information: 
   - A confirmation of the subscribed key-events (event-header). 
   - The result of all key-event property evaluations (properties-
     header). 
   - The initial state of subscribed key-events that have a non-default 
     state (state-header).

Internet Draft           SIP Key Events Package       December 19, 2001 

   The procedure for generating the Initial NOTIFY request message is 
   as follows. 
    
7.7.1.1.  Event Header Processing 
    
   This section describes how the subscribed key-events set is 
   generated.  The subscribed key-events set is placed in the event 
   header of the Initial NOTIFY request.  It also forms part of the 
   subscription state information and is used in generating the other 
   headers.  The set is formed from the event header in the SUBSCRIBE 
   key-event body. 
    
   The subscribed key-events set is formed by expanding all wildcards 
   in the requested key-events set and intersecting the resulting key-
   event set with the supported key-event set. 
    
   Procedure: 
    
   An event header of "*" results in a subscribed key-event set equal 
   to the supported key-event set.  If the event header does not 
   contain a "*" then the following procedure is performed for each 
   element on the event header line: 
    
   If the key-event-list for the sub-package is empty (e.g., "e: user") 
   then all supported key-events in the specified sub-package are added 
   to the subscribed key-events set.  Otherwise, the following 
   procedure is performed for each element in the key-event-list: 
    
   For enumerated key-event sets (e.g., "@dialpad"), if all key-events 
   in the set are supported, then the enumerated key-event set is added 
   to the subscribed key-events set.  Otherwise the enumerated key-
   event set is simply replaced by its equivalent key-event list for 
   individual evaluation. 
    
   All key-event identifiers and ranges are checked against the 
   supported key-event set and supported key-events are added to the 
   subscribed key-event set. 
    
   The resulting set is the subscribed key-event set. 
    
   The event header in the NOTIFY body is generated from the subscribed 
   key-event set by grouping together all key-events in the same sub-
   package.  This is done to keep header length down, for example, 
   "key[47-58,10,35]" is preferred over "key[47], key[48], key[49], 
   ...". 
    
   If the subscribed key-event set is empty then an empty event-header 
   is generated ("e:") and a Subscription-Expires SIP header with an 
   expiry value of zero is placed in the NOTIFY request. 
    
7.7.1.2.  Properties Header Processing 
    

 
Culpepper/Cuninghame/Mule                                     [Page 23] 

Internet Draft           SIP Key Events Package       December 19, 2001 

   The properties header in the SUBSCRIBE message body is evaluated to 
   form the properties header used in the NOTIFY body as follows: 
    
   Each element in the SUBSCRIBE properties header is checked.  If the 
   property is not supported for any sub-package then no action is 
   taken for this element.  Otherwise, the input key-event set is 
   calculated (the key-event set on which the property will operate).  
   This set is generated in a similar manner to the subscribed key-
   event set described in the previous section except that the 
   subscribed key-event set is used instead of the supported key-event 
   set (properties only operate on subscribed key-events) and the 
   requested key-event set is equal to the event-set component of the 
   current header element.  The resulting input key-event set is 
   further reduced by removing all key-events for which the property is 
   not supported.  At this point, the property is evaluated for each 
   element in the input key-event set.  For each evaluation, if the 
   property generated a result then the result is added to the output 
   set, otherwise no action is taken. 
    
   Like the event header, the properties header is generated from the 
   output set by grouping together all key-events with the same 
   property result (and in the same sub-package).  For example, 
   "key[47-58].exists(keypad)" is preferred over 
   "key[47].exists(keypad), key[48].exists(keypad), 
   key[49].exists(keypad), ...". 
    
   If the output set is empty then the properties header is not added 
   to the message. 
    
7.7.1.3.  State Header Processing 
    
   A state notification is generated for each key-event in the 
   subscribed key-event set for which the current state is not equal to 
   the default state.  This set of state notifications form the initial 
   state-header. 
    
   If all subscribed key-events are in the default state then a state-
   header is not added to the message. 
    
7.7.2. Generating State Change NOTIFY Requests 
    
   The message bodies for NOTIFY requests generated in response to key 
   state changes only possess two headers: the time-header and the 
   state-header. 
    
   The state change information in the state-header is a delta 
   indication of the key-event state.  That is, the NOTIFY body only 
   includes the state information of key-events that have changed since 
   the last notification. 
    
   Further "key-event" NOTIFY requests reporting state changes MUST NOT 
   be sent until a final response is received for the previous "key-
   event" NOTIFY request, that is, there should be only one outstanding 
 
Culpepper/Cuninghame/Mule                                     [Page 24] 

Internet Draft           SIP Key Events Package       December 19, 2001 

   "key-event" NOTIFY request at any time.  This reduces the buffering 
   and sequencing requirements of the subscriber.  Instead, multiple 
   key state change notifications MAY be sent in the state-header of a 
   single message (in other words, further state change indications can 
   be added to the end of the state-header if these changes occur 
   before the current NOTIFY is sent). 
    
7.8. Subscriber Processing of NOTIFY Requests 
    
   The NOTIFY response is generated as described in [2].  NOTIFY 
   responses do not contain key-event Event message bodies. 
    
7.9. Subscriber Generation of SUBSCRIBE Requests 
    
   The SUBSCRIBE request for "key-event" SIP events is generated as 
   described in [2] with the following clarifications: 
     . the Event header is set to "Event: key-event". 
     . the Content-Type header is set to "Content-Type: 
       application/key-event" if a Key-Event message body is included. 
     . if dialog specific subscription is required then the "Applies-
       To" header is added as described in Appendix A. 
    
   The event-header will contain the list of desired key-events to 
   receive notifications for and MAY include wildcards.  The 
   properties-header will contain the set of key-event properties which 
   are desired to be set or retrieved. 
    
   A new "key-event" event SUBSCRIBE request for an existing 
   subscription dialog will entirely replace the subscription state of 
   previous SUBSCRIBE requests in that dialog. 
    
   If the SIP Expires header has a value of zero then the subscriber 
   application should still expect one further NOTIFY request to be 
   sent by the notifier (as described in [2]).  If the SUBSCRIBE 
   request contained a Key-Event message body, then the NOTIFY request 
   should also contain a Key-Event message body if the subscription 
   request was accepted and the desired session was available (for 
   dialog specific subscriptions). 
    
   When using the "key-event" package, if the SIP Expires header does 
   not have a value of zero then the subscriber application MUST 
   include a Key-Event message body. 
    
7.10. Pre-loaded Routes in SUBSCRIBE requests 
    
   The following section applies only to dialog-specific subscriptions 
   where the subscriber application is located along the associated 
   INVITE dialog call path and wishes to collect key-events from one of 
   the User Agent endpoints. 
    
   In order to maximize the likelihood that a SUBSCRIBE request will 
   successfully reach the desired User Agent, it is RECOMMENDED the 
   subscriber place pre-loaded Route headers in the SUBSCRIBE request 
 
Culpepper/Cuninghame/Mule                                     [Page 25] 

Internet Draft           SIP Key Events Package       December 19, 2001 

   to reproduce any Record-Routes established in the associated INVITE 
   dialog.  The presence of record-routed Application Level Gateways 
   controlling firewalls and/or NAT∆s is a typical example of when this 
   may be helpful. 
    
   When the subscriber wishes to send a SUBSCRIBE request to the 
   caller, the Route set is constructed (in the manner that the callee 
   would normally use) from the Record-Route and Contact headers in the 
   original INVITE request. 
    
   When the subscriber wishes to send a SUBSCRIBE request to the 
   callee, the Route set is constructed (in the manner that the caller 
   would normally use) from the Record-Route and Contact headers in the 
   original 200 OK INVITE response.  However in the case where the 
   subscriber application is acting as a proxy in the original INVITE 
   dialog (c.f., Usage Scenario 2, Section 2.2.2), then the subscriber 
   should ignore all Record-Route headers up to and including the 
   Record-Route inserted by the subscriber application in the 200 OK 
   INVITE response. 
    
7.11. Handling of Forked Subscriptions 
    
   A SUBSCRIBE request may fork and arrive at multiple devices.  In 
   this case, the subscriber can terminate those subscriptions it 
   wishes by sending a SUBSCRIBE with an Expires value set to 0.  It 
   can also respond to any NOTIFYs from a UA with a 481 Transaction 
   Does Not Exist. 
    
   If the subscriber wishes to accept multiple subscriptions, merging 
   of state is not defined due to the fact that the multiple 
   subscriptions represent the state of multiple devices. 
    
   A notifier SHOULD return 482 Request Merged response to subsequent 
   multiple subscriptions having the same SUBSCRIBE request transaction 
   id (even if they have differing request-uri∆s). 
    
7.12. Rate of Notifications 
    
   The use of the Key Events packages should be limited to situations 
   that require limited amount of data to be transported.  As each key 
   press can cause a notification (and response) to be sent, this 
   mechanism is inefficient in scenarios where a significant amount of 
   data is to be transferred between two endpoints.  However, as key 
   event packages are designed to transport user indications, the rate 
   of notifications should not be much more than ten per second nor 
   more than 10 to 20 events at a time. 
    
    
8. Examples 
    
   In the example call flow below, an application server subscribes to 
   the status of a caller's keypad events.  NOTIFY requests are sent 
   for two key presses, in addition to the initial NOTIFY indicating 
 
Culpepper/Cuninghame/Mule                                     [Page 26]

   those key-events the notifier supports and their initial state.  Via 
   headers are omitted for clarity.

   The notifier confirms subscribed key-events and property values 
   along with non-default initial key-event states.  In this example 
   the notifier has created a subscription for keys { '0' - '9', '*', 
   '#', 'A' - 'D' } and confirms that the dwndly property has been set.  
   All keys except '*' are in the default (keyup) state; '*' has been 
   depressed since 1.902 seconds before the specified NTP time value, 
   that is, the key was depressed at 36539656.098 seconds past the 
   epoch.  No multiple key instances exist.

   The Notifier reports that the '1' key was pressed at time 
   36539667.13.  The keydown has been generated because the key has 
   been depressed for more than 1000ms.  In this example the NOTIFY 
   request was actually generated at time 36539668.13 which explains 
   the -987ms offset from the NTP time.

9. Security Considerations 
    
   Key-Event Subscriptions are very likely to reveal sensitive 
   information such as pin-numbers and destination numbers.  Therefore, 
   it is REQUIRED that devices accepting SUBSCRIBE requests perform 
   some level of authentication before establishing a subscription.  
   When such authentication is not provided by the network layer (e.g., 
   IPSEC or private/trusted networks), then it MUST be provided by the 
   transport-layer (e.g., TLS) or application-layer (e.g., SIP 
   message/header authentication). 
    
   Likewise, the information provided in the NOTIFY request is also 
   likely to contain sensitive information and so the notifier MUST 
   ensure that the NOTIFY requests are transported securely.  Once 
   again, this protection could be provided by the network-layer (e.g., 
   IPSEC encryption or private networks), transport layer (e.g., TLS 
   encryption) or application layer (e.g., S/MIME or SIP message body 
   encryption). 
    
   Alternatively, it is possible for the notifier to allow 
   unsecured/unauthenticated subscribers to subscribe to key-events 
   which will not divulge sensitive information.  For instance, 
   subscriptions to the "*" and "#" keys should not divulge sensitive 
   information but may provide sufficient functionality for some 
   3pcc/B2BUA pre-paid calling card applications. 
    
    
10.  Minimal Implementation for Key-Event Server Devices 
    
   Firstly, even a minimal implementation MUST address the security 
   considerations described in the previous section. 
 
Culpepper/Cuninghame/Mule                                     [Page 32] 

Internet Draft           SIP Key Events Package       December 19, 2001 

    
   When a device does not have any user-defined keys, locally-
   configured names, multiple key instances or numbered buttons (e.g., 
   a simple DTMF telephone dialpad) then the implementation can be made 
   quite simple.  In these cases the "exists" and "name" properties can 
   be deemed OPTIONAL. 
    
   Also, if remote configuration of "dwndly" is not required then the 
   properties header line could be ignored completely. 
    
    
11.  Guidelines to Future Sub-Package Authors 
    
   Future sub-packages must not duplicate key-events contained in 
   existing sub-packages. 
    
   If the relevant sub-package already exists then an extension for the 
   existing sub-package should be proposed rather than a new sub-
   package. 
    
   Once published as a standard, new key-event states or enumerated 
   key-event sets MAY NOT be added to an existing sub-package.  Only 
   new key-event values and OPTIONAL key-event properties may be added 
   to existing sub-packages. 
    
   New sub-packages should reuse the states and properties of the 
   existing sub-packages where possible. 
    
    
Appendix A.  Dialog specific subscriptions, Applies-To Header 
    
   The "Applies-To" SIP header is used in SIP requests to indicate the 
   INVITE-initiated dialog that the request is associated with.  One of 
   its uses is in SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY requests with which it is 
   desired to associate a SUBSCRIBE dialog with an INVITE dialog or 
   alternatively with the conversation space [5] associated with the 
   dialog. 
    
   The Applies-To header is based on the dialog attribute list defined 
   in the SIP call-packages draft [8].  The approach described here for 
   conveying dialog identification differs from that in [8] in that the 
   dialog identification is placed in a message header (whereas [8] 
   encodes this information into the event body itself).  The reasons 
   for this change are as follows: 
    
   - It is desirable to keep the contents of the Key-Event message 
     bodies to be protocol independent. 
   - This approach represents a mechanism for identifying dialogs which 
     is re-usable by many event packages rather than being event 
     specific. 
   - By separating subscription-filtering (SIP) from event processing 
     (Event Package), a SIP device is able to reject subscription 

 
Culpepper/Cuninghame/Mule                                     [Page 33] 

Internet Draft           SIP Key Events Package       December 19, 2001 

     requests for unknown entities/dialogs to be rejected independently 
     of the events requested. 
   - Any interaction between the SIP call-control models and the 
     dialog-specific subscriptions can be handled in an Event Package 
     independent manner. 
    
A.1.  Applies-To Header 
    
   This table expands on tables 4 and 5 in RFC 2543 [3], as amended by 
   the changes described in section 4.1 of [2]. 
    
   Header field       where   enc   e-e ACK BYE CAN INV OPT REG SUB NOT 
   -------------------------------------------------------------------- 
   Applies-To           R            e   -   -   -   -   -   -   o   - 
   Applies-To           r            e   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   - 
    
   The Applies-To header's presence indicates the subscription applies 
   to the dialog specified.  That is, when the header is present in a 
   SUBSCRIBE it indicates the subscriber wishes to be notified of 
   events that occur in conjunction with the specified dialog or 
   conversation-space at the SIP device.  It has the following 
   semantics when used with a SUBSCRIBE request to establish a 
   subscription dialog: 
    
   - Subscriptions expire implicitly when the associated session 
     dialog/conversation-space terminates. 
   - State changes must only be reported for device events while the 
     device is *actively* associated with the dialog/conversation-space 
     subscribed to.  [c.f., Section 3.1.1] 
    
   If the subscriber places an Applies-To header in the initial 
   SUBSCRIBE request then it MUST also be placed unchanged in all 
   subsequent SUBSCRIBE requests, however, a notifier MUST ignore the 
   Applies-To headers in all but the initial SUBSCRIBE request.  [This 
   allows a notifier to restart but ensures that the subscription does 
   not change over time.] 
    
   Applies-To = "Applies-To" ":" appliesto-component  
                                 [ "," appliesto-component ] 
   appliesto-component = "call-id" "=" Call-ID  
                       | "local-tag" "=" UUID 
                       | "remote-tag" "=" UUID  
                       | "attach" = ( "dialog" | "cspace" | token ) 
                       | future-extension 
    
   No minimum set of components has been specified for the Applies-To 
   header - it is the responsibility of the generator to ensure that 
   the Applies-To header uniquely identifies a dialog on the target.  
   For most cases it is RECOMMENDED that the Applies-To contains the 
   call-id, local-tag and remote-tag components. 
    
   The "attach" component indicates whether the subscription is 
   associated to the dialog itself or to the conversation space to 

 
Culpepper/Cuninghame/Mule                                     [Page 34] 

Internet Draft           SIP Key Events Package       December 19, 2001 

   which the dialog currently belongs.  The assumed value for the 
   "attach" component (when not present) is "attach=dialog". 
   
A.2.  Dialog Attached Mode 
    
   In this mode, the subscription receives key-events from the user 
   endpoint associated with the specified dialog endpoint whenever the 
   user is *actively* communicating through that user endpoint.  [An 
   example of a user endpoint in this context could be a single virtual 
   "line" on a multi-line SIP phone.] 
    
   The subscription is terminated when the dialog is terminated.  The 
   RECOMMENDED subscription expiry timeout is on the order of a day.  
   When a subscription is terminated due to dialog termination, the 
   notifier MAY send a NOTIFY with "Subscription-Expires: 0" header 
   however this is deemed unnecessary in most cases. 
   
A.3.  Conversation Space Attached Mode 
    
   Just as for dialog attached subscriptions, the subscription receives 
   key-events from the user endpoint associated with the specified 
   dialog endpoint (at the time of subscription) whenever the user is 
   *actively* communicating through that user endpoint. 
    
   However for conversation space attached dialogs, the subscription is 
   terminated when the conversation space of the user endpoint is 
   reduced to a conversation space containing only the user endpoint 
   (or an empty conversation space).  For instance, in this mode the 
   subscription would *not* be terminated when an INVITE with a 
   Replaces header was received from the network but would be 
   terminated when all other participants leave a distributed 
   conference.  It is RECOMMENDED that  the subscription expiry timeout 
   SHOULD have a value ranging from minutes up to an hour.  The 
   notifier MUST send a NOTIFY with Subscription-Expires: 0 header when 
   the subscription terminates. 
      
A.4 Handling of non-existent Applies-To dialogs. 
    
   When a SUBSCRIBE request is received containing an Applies-To header 
   referring to a non-existent dialog then a "481 Applies-To Call Leg 
   Does Not Exist" error response should be sent. 
    
IANA Considerations 
    
   Guidelines for registering key event packages with IANA will be 
   completed in a future draft revision.
