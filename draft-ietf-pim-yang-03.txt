1.  Introduction

   YANG [RFC6020] [RFC6087] is a data definition language that was
   introduced to model the configuration and running state of a device
   managed using NETCONF [RFC6241].  YANG is now also being used as a
   component of wider management interfaces, such as CLIs.

   This document defines a draft YANG data model that can be used to
   configure and manage Protocol-Independent Multicast (PIM) devices.
   Currently this model is incomplete, but it will support the core PIM
   protocol, as well as many other features mentioned in separate PIM

   RFCs.  Non-core features are defined as optional in the provided data
   model.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
   [RFC6020].

   This draft employs YANG tree diagrams, which are explained in
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc6087bis].

2.  Design of Data Model

2.1.  Scope of model

   The model covers PIM Sparse Mode [RFC7761], including the Source-
   Specific subset [RFC3569], Dense Mode [RFC3973], and Bi-directional
   PIM [RFC5015].

   The PIM extensions represented in the model include BSR [RFC5059] and
   Anycast-RP [RFC4610].

   The data model can be used to configure and manage these protocol
   features.  The operational state data and statistics can be retrieved
   by this model.  The protocol specific notifications are also defined
   in the model.

   This model does not cover other multicast protocols such as IGMP/MLD,
   MSDP, mVPN, or m-LDP in-band signalling.  It does not cover any
   configuration required to generate the MRIB.  These will be specified
   in separate documents.

2.2.  Optional capabilities

   This model is designed to represent the capabilities of PIM devices
   with various specifications, including some with basic subsets of the
   PIM protocol.  The main design goals of this draft are that any major
   now-existing implementation may be said to support the base model,
   and that the configuration of all implementations meeting the
   specification is easy to express through some combination of the
   features in the base model and simple vendor augmentations.

   There is also value in widely-supported features being standardized,
   to save work for individual vendors, and so that mapping between
   different vendors' configuration is not needlessly complicated.
   Therefore, these modules declare a number of features representing
   capabilities that not all deployed devices support.

   The extensive use of feature declarations should also substantially
   simplify the capability negotiation process for a vendor's PIM
   implementation.

   On the other hand, operational state parameters are not so widely
   designated as features, as there are many cases where the defaulting
   of an operational state parameter would not cause any harm to the
   system, and it is much more likely that an implementation without
   native support for a piece of operational state would be able to
   derive a suitable value for a state variable that is not natively
   supported.

   For the same reason, wide constant ranges (for example, timer maxima
   and minima) will be used in the model.  It is expected that vendors
   will augment the model with any specific restrictions that might be
   required.  Vendors may also extend the features list with proprietary
   extensions.

2.3.  Top-level structure

   This model defines several separate modules for modelling PIM
   configuration, defined below.  Again, this separation will make it
   easier to express the specific capabilities of a PIM device.

   The hierarchy of PIM configuration is designed so that objects that
   are only relevant for one situation or feature are collected in a
   container for that feature.  For example, the configuration for PIM-
   SM that is not relevant for an SSM-only implementation is collected
   in an ASM container.

   Where fields are not genuinely essential to protocol operation, they
   are marked as optional.  Some fields will be essential but have a
   default specified, so they need not be explicitly configured.

   This module structure also applies, where applicable, to the
   operational state and notifications of the model.

2.4.  Position of address family in hierarchy

   This document contains address-family as a node in the hierarchy
   multiple times: both under the interface list, and under the PIM

   instance.  This is similar to other protocol Yang models such as IS-
   IS.

   The reasoning for this is to make it easier for implementations in
   which configuration options are not supported for specific address
   families.

   For these implementations, the restriction that interface
   configuration must be address-family independent must either be
   expressed as a vendor augmentation of an address-family-independent
   parameter above the address-family level, or by a constraint on the
   base model objects of a form similar to:

   must ". = ../../address-family[address-family='ipv4']/
   interface[interface=current()/sibling:interface]/dr-priority" {
   error-app-tag dr-priority-mismatch; error-message "Error: IPv6 DR
   priority must match IPv4 DR priority "; }

3.  Module Structure

3.1.  PIM base module

   The PIM base module defines the router-wide configuration options not
   specific to any PIM mode, and is included by the other modules.
   There are a couple of things worth mentioning here regarding where
   the PIM model fits in the overall routing hierarchy:

   1.  This data model agrees to a routing-instance-centric (VRF) model
       view as opposed to protocol-centric mainly because it fits well
       into the routing-instance model, and it is easier to map from the
       VRF-centric to the protocol-centric than the other way around due
       to forward references.

   2.  The PIM base model augments "/rt:routing/rt:control-plane-
       protocols" as opposed to augmenting "/rt:routing/rt:control-
       plane-protocols/ rt:control-plane-protocol" as the latter would
       allow multiple protocol instances per VRF, which does not make
       sense for PIM.

3.2.  PIM RP module

   The PIM RP module contains configuration information scoped to RPs or
   ranges of group addresses.  This does not belong in the hierarchy
   under any PIM mode, but is augmented by the individual mode-specific
   modules as appropriate.

             module: ietf-pim-rp
   augment /rt:routing/rt:control-plane-protocols/pim-base:pim/

5.  Security Considerations

   Configuration and state data defined in this document are designed to
   be accessed via a management protocol with secure transport layer,
   such as NETCONF [RFC6241].  The NETCONF access control model
   [RFC6536] provides the means to restrict access for specific users to
   a pre- configured subset of all available operations and contents.

   The models defined in this document contain a number of configuration
   data nodes that are writable, creatable, and deletable.  Unauthorised
   access to the configuration data can adversely affect the routing
   subsystem of both the local device and the network.  This may lead to
   network malfunctions, delivery of packets to inappropriate
   destinations and other problems.

6.  IANA Considerations

   RFC Ed.: In this section, replace all occurrences of 'XXXX' with the
   actual RFC number (and remove this note).

   This document registers the following namespace URIs in the IETF XML
   registry [RFC3688]:

    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-pim-base
    Registrant Contact: The IESG.
    XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.
