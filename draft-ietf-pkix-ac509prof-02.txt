Abstract

   This specification defines a profile for the use of X.509 Attribute
   Certificates in Internet Protocols. Attribute certificates may be
   used in a wide range of applications and environments covering a
   broad spectrum of interoperability goals and a broader spectrum of
   operational and assurance requirements. The goal of this document is
   to establish a common baseline for generic applications requiring
   broad interoperability as well as limited special purpose
   requirements.  The profile places emphasis on attribute certificate
   support for Internet electronic mail, IPSec, and WWW security
   applications.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                              March 2000


1. Introduction

   The key words "MUST", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "RECOMMENDED", and "MAY"
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   A server makes an access control decision when a client requests
   access to a resource offered by that server. The server must ensure
   that the client is authorized to access that resource. The server
   decision is based on the access control policy, the context of the
   request, and the identity and authorizations of the client. The
   access control policy and the context of the request are readily
   available to the server. Certificates may be used to provide
   identity and authorization information about the client.

   Similar access control decisions are made in other network
   environments, such as a store-and-forward electronic mail
   environment. That is, access control decisions are not limited to
   client-server protocol environments.

   X.509 public key certificates (PKCs) [X.509-97], [X.509-DAM],
   [PKIXPROF] bind an identity and a public key. The identity may be
   used to support identity-based access control decisions after the
   client proves that it has access to the private key that corresponds
   to the public key contained in the PKC. The public key is used to
   validate digital signatures or cryptographic key management
   operations. However, not all access control decisions are identity-
   based. Rule-based, role-based, and rank-based access control
   decisions require additional information. For example, information
   about a client's ability to pay for a resource access may be more
   important than the client's identity. Authorization information to
   support such access control decisions may be placed in a PKC
   extension or placed in a separate attribute certificate (AC).

   The placement of authorization information in PKCs is usually
   undesirable for two reasons. First, authorization information does
   not have the same lifetime as the binding of the identity and the
   public key. When authorization information is placed in a PKC
   extension, the general result is the shortening of the PKC useful
   lifetime. Second, the PKC issuer is not usually authoritative for
   the authorization information. This results in additional steps for
   the PKC issuer to obtain authorization information from the
   authoritative source.

   For these reasons, it is often better to separate this authorization
   information from the PKC. Yet, this authorization information also
   needs to be protected in a fashion similar to a PKC. An attribute
   certificate (AC) provides this protection, and it is simply a
   digitally signed (or certified) set of attributes.

   An AC is a structure similar to a PKC; the main difference being
   that it contains no public key. An AC may contain attributes that
   specify group membership, role, security clearance, and other access
   control information associated with the AC holder. The syntax for

Farrell & Housley                                             [Page 3]


INTERNET-DRAFT                                              March 2000


   the AC is defined in Recommendation X.509 (making the term "X.509
   certificate" ambiguous). This document specifies a profile of the
   X.509 AC suitable for use with authorization information within
   Internet protocols.

   When making an access control decision based on an AC, an access
   control decision function may need to ensure that the appropriate AC
   holder is the entity that has requested access. For example, one way
   in which the linkage between the request and the AC can be achieved
   is if the AC has a "pointer" to a PKC for the requester and that PKC
   has been used to authenticate the access request.

   As there is often confusion about the difference between PKCs and
   ACs, an analogy may help. A PKC can be considered to be like a
   passport: it identifies the holder, tends to last for a long time
   and should not be trivial to obtain. An AC is more like an entry
   visa: it is typically issued by a different authority and does not
   last for as long a time. As acquiring an entry visa typically
   requires presenting a passport, getting a visa can be a simpler
   process.

1.1 Delegation and AC chains

   The X.509 standard defines delegation as "Conveyance of privilege
   from one entity that holds such privilege, to another entity". It
   further defines a delegation path as "An ordered sequence of
   certificates which, together with authentication of a privilege
   asserter's identity can be processed to verify the authenticity of a
   privilege asserter's privilege". It then goes on to define various
   mechanisms for use in delegation cases involving "chains" of ACs.

   As the administration and processing associated with such AC chains
   is potentially much more complex than use of a single AC, and as the
   use of ACs in the Internet is today in its infancy, this
   specification does not address such AC chains. Other (future)
   specifications may address the use of AC chains.

   This means that conformant implementations are only REQUIRED to be
   able to "handle" a single AC at a time. Note however, that
   validation of that AC MAY require validation of a full PKC chain, as
   specified in [PKIXPROF].

1.2 Attribute Certificate Distribution ("push" vs "pull")

   As discussed above, ACs provide a mechanism to securely provide
   authorization information to access control decision functions.
   However, there are a number of possible communication paths that an
   AC may take.

   In some environments it is suitable for a client to "push" an AC to
   a server. This means that no new connections between the client and
   server are required. It also means that no search burden is imposed
   on servers, which improves performance.

Farrell & Housley                                             [Page 4]


INTERNET-DRAFT                                              March 2000



   In other cases, it is more suitable for a client simply to
   authenticate to the server and for the server to request ("pull")
   the client's AC from an AC issuer or a repository. A major benefit
   of the "pull" model is that it can be implemented without changes to
   the client or client-server protocol. It is also more suitable for
   some inter-domain cases where the client's rights should be assigned
   within the server's domain, rather than within the client's "home"
   domain.

   There are a number of possible exchanges that can occur and three
   entities involved (client, server and AC issuer). In addition the
   use of a directory service or other repository for AC retrieval MAY
   be supported.

   Figure 1 shows an abstract view of the exchanges that may involve
   ACs. This profile does not specify protocol for these exchanges.

2. Terminology

   For simplicity, we use the terms client and server in this
   specification. This is not intended to indicate that ACs are only to
   be used in client-server environments, e.g. in the S/MIME v3
   context, the mail user agent would, by turns, be both "client" and
   "server" in the sense the terms are used here.

    Term          Meaning

    AA            Attribute Authority, the entity that issues the
                   AC, synonymous in this specification with "AC
                   issuer"
    AC            Attribute Certificate
    AC user       any entity that parses or processes an AC
    AC verifier   any entity that checks the validity of an AC and
                   then makes use of the result
    AC issuer     the entity which signs the AC, synonymous in this
                   specification with "AA"
    AC holder     the entity indicated (perhaps indirectly) in the
                   holder field of the AC
    Client        the entity which is requesting the action for
                   which authorization checks are to be made
    Proxying      In this specification, Proxying is used to mean
                   the situation where an application server acts as
                   an application client on behalf of a user.
                   Proxying here does not mean granting of authority.
    PKC           Public Key Certificate - uses the type ASN.1
                   Certificate defined in X.509 and profiled in RFC
                   2459. This (non-standard) acronym is used in order
                   to avoid confusion about the term "X.509
                   certificate".
    Server        the entity which requires that the authorization
                   checks are made

INTERNET-DRAFT                                              March 2000


3. Requirements

   This Attribute Certificate profile meets the following requirements.

   Time/Validity requirements:

   1.   Support for short-lived or long-lived ACs is required. Typical
        validity periods might be measured in hours, as opposed to
        months for X.509 public key certificates. Short validity
        periods mean that ACs can be useful without a revocation
        mechanism.

   Attribute Types:

   2.   Issuers of ACs should be able to define their own attribute
        types for use within closed domains.
   3.   Some standard attribute types should be defined which can be
        contained within ACs, for example "access identity", "group",
        "role", "clearance", "audit identity", "charging id" etc.
   4.   Standard attribute types should be defined so that it is
        possible for an AC verifier to distinguish between e.g. the
        "Administrators group" as defined by Baltimore and the
        "Administrators group" as defined by SPYRUS.

   Targeting of ACs:

   5.   It should be possible to "target" an AC. This means that a
        given AC may be "targeted" at one, or a small number of,
        servers in the sense that a trustworthy non- target will reject
        the AC for authorization decisions.

   Push vs. Pull

   6.   ACs should be defined so that they can either be "pushed" by
        the client to the server, or "pulled" by the server from a
        repository or other network service (which may be an online AC
        issuer).

















Farrell & Housley                                             [Page 8]


INTERNET-DRAFT                                              March 2000


4. The AC Profile

   Attribute certificates may be used in a wide range of applications
   and environments covering a broad spectrum of interoperability goals
   and a broader spectrum of operational and assurance requirements.
   The goal of this document is to establish a common baseline for
   generic applications requiring broad interoperability and limited
   special purpose requirements.  In particular, the emphasis will be
   on supporting the use of attribute certificates for informal
   Internet electronic mail, IPSec, and WWW applications.

   This section presents a profile for attribute certificates that will
   foster interoperability. This section also defines some private
   extensions for the Internet community.

   While the ISO/IEC/ITU documents use the 1993 (or later) version of
   ASN.1; as has been done for PKCs [PKIXPROF], this document uses the
   1988 ASN.1 syntax, the encoded certificate and standard extensions
   are equivalent.

   Where maximum lengths for fields are specified, these lengths refer
   to the DER encoding and do not include the ASN.1 tag or length
   fields.

   Conforming implementations MUST support the profile specified in
   this section.

           AttributeType ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER

           AttributeValue ::= ANY

   Implementers should note that the DER encoding (DER is defined in
   [X.208-88]) of the SET OF values requires ordering of the encodings
   of the values. Though this issue arises with respect to
   distinguished names, and has to be handled by [PKIXPROF]
   implementations, its is much more significant in this context, since
   the inclusion of multiple values is much more common in ACs.

4.2 Profile of Standard Fields

   For all GeneralName fields in this profile the otherName,
   x400Address, ediPartyName and registeredID options MUST NOT be used
   unless otherwise specified (e.g. as in the description of targeting
   extension).

   The use of Kerberos [KRB] format names, encoded into the otherName,
   SHOULD however, be supported using the krb5PrincipalName OID and the
   KerberosName syntax as defined in [PKINIT].

   This means that unless otherwise indicated,(e.g. for the role
   attribute), conforming implementations MUST be able to support the
   dNSName, directoryName, uniformResourceIdentifier and iPAddress
   fields in all cases where GeneralName is used. The MUST support
   requirements for each of these fields are as specified in
   [PKIXPROF], (mainly in section 4.2.1.7).

4.2.1   Version

   This MUST be the default value of v1, i.e. not present in the DER
   encoding, except where the holder is identified using the optional
   objectDigestInfo field, as specified in section 7.3.

4.2.2   Holder

   For any environment where the AC is passed in an authenticated
   message or session, and where the authentication is based on the use
   of an X.509 public key certificate (PKC), the holder field SHOULD
   use the baseCertificateID.

   With the baseCertificateID option, the holder's PKC serialNumber and
   issuer MUST be identical to the AC holder field. The PKC issuer MUST
   have a non empty distinguished name which is to be present as the
   single value of the holder.baseCertificateID.issuer construct in the
   directoryName field. The holder.baseCertificateID.issuerUID field
   MUST only be used if the holder's PKC contains an issuerUniqueID
   field (in which case, the same value MUST be present in the
   holder.baseCertificateID.issuerUID_field). Thus, the
   baseCertificateID is only usable with PKC profiles (like [PKIXPROF])


Farrell & Housley                                            [Page 11]


INTERNET-DRAFT                                              March 2000


   which mandate that the PKC issuer field contain a non empty
   distinguished name value.

   Note: An "empty" distinguished name is a distinguished name where
   the SEQUENCE OF relative distinguished names is of zero length. In a
   DER encoding this has the value '3000'H.

   If the holder field uses the entityName option and the underlying
   authentication is based on a PKC, then the entityName MUST be the
   same as the PKC subject field, unless the PKC subject field contains
   an empty distinguished name. In that case, the entityName field MUST
   be identical to one of the values of the PKC subjectAltName field
   extension. Note that [PKIXPROF] mandates that the subjectAltNames
   extension be present if the PKC subject is a non empty distinguished
   name.

   In any other case where the holder field uses the entityName option
   then only one name SHOULD be present.

   Implementations conforming to this profile are not required to
   support the use of the objectDigest field. However, section 7.3
   specifies how this optional feature MAY be used.

   Any protocol conforming to this profile SHOULD specify which AC
   holder option is to be used and how this fits with the supported
   authentication schemes define in that protocol.

4.2.3   Issuer

   ACs conforming to this profile MUST use the newForm.issuerName
   choice, which MUST contain one and only one GeneralName, which MUST
   contain a non empty distinguished name in the directoryName field.
   This means that all AC issuers MUST have non empty distinguished
   names.

   Part of the reason for the use of the issuerName field is that it
   allows the AC verifier to be independent of the AC issuer's public
   key infrastructure. Using the baseCertificateId field to reference
   the AC issuer would mean that the AC verifier would have such a
   dependency.

4.2.4   Signature

   Contains the algorithm identifier used to validate the AC signature.

   This MUST be one of the following algorithms defined in [PKIXPROF]
   section 7.2: md5WithRSAEncryption, id-dsa-with-sha1 or sha-
   1WithRSAEncryption, or ecdsa-with-SHA1 defined in [ECDSA] section
   3.2.

   id-dsa-with-sha1 MUST be supported by all AC users. The other
   algorithms SHOULD be supported.


Farrell & Housley                                            [Page 12]


INTERNET-DRAFT                                              March 2000


4.2.5   Serial Number

   For any conforming AC, the issuer/serialNumber pair MUST form a
   unique combination, even if ACs are very short-lived (one second is
   the shortest possible validity due to the use of GeneralizedTime).

   AC issuers MUST force the serialNumber to be a positive integer,
   that is, the sign bit in the DER encoding of the INTEGER value MUST
   be zero - this can be done by adding a leading (leftmost) `00'H
   octet if necessary. This removes a potential ambiguity in mapping
   between a string of octets and an integer value.

   Given the uniqueness and timing requirements above serial numbers
   can be expected to contain long integers. AC users MUST be able to
   handle serialNumber values longer than 32 bits. Conformant ACs MUST
   NOT use serialNumber values longer than 20 octets.

   There is no requirement that the serial numbers used by any AC
   issuer follow any particular ordering, in particular, they need not
   be monotonically increasing with time, but they MUST be unique for a
   given AC issuer.

4.2.6   Validity Period

   The attrCertValidityPeriod (a.k.a. validity) field specifies the
   period for which the AC issuer expects that the binding between the
   holder and the attributes fields will be valid.

   The generalized time type, GeneralizedTime, is a standard ASN.1 type
   for variable precision representation of time.  Optionally, the
   GeneralizedTime field can include a representation of the time
   differential between local and Greenwich Mean Time.

   For the purposes of this profile, GeneralizedTime values MUST be
   expressed Greenwich Mean Time (Zulu) and MUST include seconds (i.e.,
   times are YYYYMMDDHHMMSSZ), even where the number of seconds is
   zero. GeneralizedTime values MUST NOT include fractional seconds.

   (Note that the above is as specified in [PKIXPROF], section
   4.1.2.5.2.)

   Note that AC users MUST be able to handle the case where an AC is
   issued, which (at the time of parsing), has its entire validity
   period in the future (a "post-dated" AC). This is valid for some
   applications, e.g. backup.

4.2.7   Attributes

   The attributes field gives information about the AC holder. When the
   AC is used for authorization this will often contain a set of
   privileges.



Farrell & Housley                                            [Page 13]


INTERNET-DRAFT                                              March 2000


   The attributes field contains a SEQUENCE OF Attribute. Each
   Attribute MAY contain a SET OF values. For a given AC each attribute
   type OID in the sequence MUST be unique, that is, only one instance
   of each attribute can occur in a single AC. All instances can
   however, be multi-valued.

   AC users MUST be able to handle multiple values for all attribute
   types.

   Note that an AC MUST contain at least one attribute, that is, the
   SEQUENCE OF Attributes MUST NOT be of zero length.

   Some standard attribute types are defined in section 4.5.

4.2.8   Issuer Unique Identifier

   This field MUST NOT be used unless it is also used in the AC
   issuer's PKC, in which case it MUST be used. Note that [PKIXPROF]
   states that this field "SHOULD NOT" be used by conforming CAs, but
   that applications SHOULD be able to parse PKCs containing the field.

4.2.9   Extensions

   The extensions field generally gives information about the AC as
   opposed to information about the AC holder.

   Section 4.3 defines the extensions that MAY be used with this
   profile. An AC that has no extensions conforms to the profile. If
   any other critical extension is used, then the AC does not conform
   to this profile. An AC that contains additional non-critical
   extensions still conforms.

   The extensions defined for ACs provide methods for associating
   additional attributes with holders.  This profile also allows
   communities to define private extensions to carry information unique
   to those communities.  Each extension in an AC may be designated as
   critical or non-critical.  An AC using system MUST reject an AC if
   it encounters a critical extension it does not recognize; however, a
   non-critical extension may be ignored if it is not recognized.
   Section 4.3 presents recommended extensions used within Internet
   certificates and standard locations for information.  Communities
   may elect to use additional extensions; however, caution should be
   exercised in adopting any critical extensions in ACs, which might
   prevent use in a general context.

4.3 Extensions.

4.3.1   Audit Identity

   In some circumstances it is required (e.g. by data protection/data
   privacy legislation) that audit trails do not contain records which
   directly identify individuals. This may make the use of the holder
   field of the AC unsuitable for use in audit trails.

Farrell & Housley                                            [Page 14]


INTERNET-DRAFT                                              March 2000



   In order to allow for such cases an AC MAY contain an audit identity
   extension. Ideally it SHOULD be infeasible to derive the AC holder's
   identity from the audit identity value except with the co-operation
   of the AC issuer.

   The value of the audit identity plus the AC issuer/serial SHOULD
   then be used for audit/logging purposes. If the value of the audit
   identity is suitably chosen then a server/service administrator can
   use audit trails to track the behavior of an AC holder without being
   able to identify the AC holder.

   The server/service administrator in combination with the AC issuer
   MUST be able to identify the AC holder in cases where misbehavior is
   detected. This means that the AC issuer MUST be able to map
   "backwards" from the audit identity to the actual identity of the AC
   holder.

   Of course, auditing could be based on the AC issuer/serial pair,
   however, this method doesn't allow tracking the same AC holder
   across different ACs. This means that an audit identity is only
   useful if it lasts for longer than the typical AC lifetime - how
   much longer is an issue for the AC issuer implementation. Auditing
   could also be based on the AC holder's PKC issuer/serial however,
   this will often allow the server/service administrator identify the
   AC holder.

   As the AC verifier might otherwise use the AC subject or some other
   identifying value for audit purposes, this extension MUST be
   critical when used.

   Protocols that use ACs will often expose the identity of the AC
   holder in the bits on-the-wire. In such cases, an "opaque" audit
   identity does not make use of the AC anonymous, it simply ensures
   that the ensuing audit trails are "semi-anonymous".

   The value of an audit identity MUST NOT be longer than 20 octets.

      name           id-pe-ac-auditIdentity
      OID            { id-pe 4 }
      syntax         OCTET STRING
      criticality    must be TRUE

4.3.2   AC Targeting

   In order to allow that an AC is "targeted", the target information
   extension MAY be used to specify a number of servers/services. The
   intent is that the AC SHOULD only be usable at the specified
   servers/services - an (honest) AC verifier who is not amongst the
   named servers/services MUST reject the AC.

   If this extension is not present then the AC is not targeted and may
   be accepted by any server.

Farrell & Housley                                            [Page 15]


INTERNET-DRAFT                                              March 2000



   In this profile, the targeting information simply consists of a list
   of named targets or groups.

   The following syntax is used to represent the targeting information:

          Targets ::= SEQUENCE OF Target
          Target ::= CHOICE {
               targetName          [0] GeneralName,
               targetGroup         [1] GeneralName,
               targetCertificate   [2] IssuerSerial,
               targetDigest        [3] ObjectDigestInfo
          }

   The targetCertificate and targetDigest fields are only present to
   allow future compatibility with [X.509-DAM] and MUST NOT be used.

   The targets check passes if the current server (recipient) is one of
   the targetName fields in the targets part, or, the current server is
   a member of one of the targetGroup fields in the targets part. In
   this case, the current server is said to "match" the targeting
   extension.

   How the membership of a target within a targetGroup is determined is
   not defined here. It is assumed that any given target "knows" the
   names of the targetGroup's to which it belongs or can otherwise
   determine its membership. For example, if the targetGroup were to be
   a DNS domain and the AC verifier knows the DNS domain to which it
   belongs. Another example would be where the targetGroup is
   "PRINTERS" and the AC verifier "knows" that it's a printer or print
   server.

      name           id-pe-ac-targeting
   <<will change this to id-ce-targetInformation from DAM if ISO can
   change its syntax otherwise stick with the PKIX OID and live with
   two different targeting extensions>>
      OID            { id-pe 5 }
      syntax         Targets
      criticality    MUST be TRUE

4.3.3   Authority Key Identifier

   The authorityKeyIdentifier extension as profiled in [PKIXPROF] MAY
   be used to assist the AC verifier in checking the signature of the
   AC. The [PKIXPROF] description should be read as if "CA" meant "AC
   issuer". As with PKCs this extension SHOULD be included in ACs.

   Note: An AC where the issuer field used the baseCertificateID choice
   would not need an authorityKeyIdentifier extension as it is
   explicitly linked to the key in the referred certificate. However,
   as this profile states (in section 4.2.3) that ACs MUST use the
   entityName choice, this does not arise here.


Farrell & Housley                                            [Page 16]

      OID            { id-ce 35 }
      syntax         AuthorityKeyIdentifier
      criticality    MUST be FALSE

4.3.4   Authority Information Access

   The authorityInformationAccess extension as defined in [PKIXPROF]
   MAY be used to assist the AC verifier in checking the revocation
   status of the AC. Note that support for the id-ad-caIssuers
   accessMethod defined in [PKIXPROF] is NOT REQUIRED as in this
   profile, the authorityInformationAccess is only used for revocation
   status checking. Conformant ACs containing this extension MUST
   contain exactly one AccessDescription.

   The following accessMethod is used to indicate that revocation
   status checking is provided for this AC, using the OCSP protocol
   defined in [OCSP]:

      id-ad-ocsp OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ad 1 }

   The accessLocation must contain a URI, this MUST contain an HTTP
   URL, specifying the location of an OCSP responder. The AC issuer
   MUST, of course, maintain an OCSP responder at this location.

      name           id-ce-authorityInfoAccess
      OID            { id-pe 1 }
      syntax         AuthorityInfoAccessSyntax
      criticality    MUST be FALSE

4.3.5   CRL Distribution Points

   The crlDistributionPoints extension as profiled in [PKIXPROF] MAY be
   used to assist the AC verifier in checking the revocation status of
   the AC. See section 6 on revocation below for details.

   Exactly one distribution point MUST be present, it MUST use the
   DistributionPointName option, which MUST contain a fullName, which
   MUST contain a single name form. That name MUST contain either an
   HTTP URL or a distinguished name.

      name           id-ce-cRLDistributionPoints
      OID            { id-ce 31 }
      syntax         CRLDistPointsSyntax
      criticality    MUST be FALSE

4.3.6   No Revocation Available

   This extension (imported from [X.509-DAM]) allows an AC issuer to
   indicate that no revocation information will be made available for
   this AC.



Farrell & Housley                                            [Page 17]


INTERNET-DRAFT                                              March 2000


   This extension MUST be non-critical, on the basis that an AC
   verifier that does not understand it can still find a revocation
   list (for example), but won't ever find an entry for the AC.

      name           id-ce-noRevAvail
      OID            { id-ce 56 }
      syntax         NULL (i.e. '0500'H is the DER encoding)
      criticality    MUST be FALSE

4.4 Attribute Types

   Some of the attribute types defined below make use of the
   IetfAttrSyntax type defined below. The reasons for using this type
   are:

   1.   It allows a separation between the AC issuer and the attribute
        policy authority. This is useful for situations where a single
        policy authority (e.g. an organization) allocates attribute
        values, but where multiple AC issuers are deployed for
        performance, network or other reasons.
   2.   The syntaxes allowed for values are restricted to OCTET STRING
        OID and UTF8String, which reduces some of the matching
        complexities associated with more general syntaxes. All multi-
        valued attributes using this syntax are restricted so that each
        value MUST use the same choice of value syntax, that is, it is
        not allowed that one value use an OID but that a second value
        uses a string.

           IetfAttrSyntax ::= SEQUENCE {
                policyAuthority [0] GeneralNames    OPTIONAL,
                values          SEQUENCE OF CHOICE {
                              octets    OCTET STRING,
                              oid       OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
                              string    UTF8String
               }
           }

   In the descriptions below, each attribute type is tagged as either
   "Multiple Allowed" or "One Attribute value only; multiple values
   within the IetfAttrSyntax". This refers to the SET OF
   AttributeValue, the AttributeType still only occurs once, as
   specified in section 4.2.7.

4.4.1   Service Authentication Information

   This attribute type identifies the AC holder to the server/service
   by a name and MAY include optional service specific authentication
   information. Typically this will contain a username/password pair
   for a "legacy" application.

   This attribute type will typically need to be encrypted if the
   authInfo field contains sensitive information (e.g. a password).

                authInfo  OCTET STRING OPTIONAL
           }

4.4.2   Access Identity

   An access identity identifies the AC holder to the server/service.
   For this attribute the authInfo field MUST NOT be present.

      syntax    SvceAuthInfo
      values:   Multiple allowed

4.4.3   Charging Identity

   This attribute type identifies the AC holder for charging purposes.
   Note that, in general, the charging identity will be different from
   other identities of the holder, for example, when the holder∆s
   company is to be charged for service.

      name      id-aca-chargingIdentity
      OID       { id-aca 3 }
      syntax    IetfAttrSyntax
      values:   One Attribute value only; multiple values within the
                IetfAttrSyntax

4.4.4   Group

   This attribute carries information about group memberships of the AC
   holder.

      name      id-aca-group
      OID       { id-aca 4 }
      syntax    IetfAttrSyntax
      values:   One Attribute value only; multiple values within the
                IetfAttrSyntax

4.4.5   Role

   This attribute (imported from [X.509-DAM]) carries information about
   role allocations of the AC holder.

   The syntax used for this attribute is:

        }

   The roleAuthority field MUST NOT be used. The roleName field MUST be
   present and MUST use the uniformResourceIdentifier field of the
   GeneralName.

      syntax    RoleSyntax

4.4.6   Clearance

   This attribute (imported from [X.501]) carries clearance (security
   labeling) information about the AC holder.

   avoid confusion (e.g. over serial numbers or revocations) an AC
   issuer MUST NOT also be a PKC Issuer (i.e. it can't be a CA as
   well), so the AC Issuer's PKC MUST NOT have a basicConstraints
   extension with isACA set to TRUE.

5. Attribute Certificate Validation

   This section describes a basic set of rules that all "valid" ACs
   MUST satisfy. Some additional checks are also described which AC
   verifiers MAY choose to implement.

   To be valid an AC MUST satisfy all of the following:

   1.   The AC signature must be cryptographically correct and the AC
        issuer's entire certification path (including the AC issuer's
        PKC) MUST be verified in accordance with [PKIXPROF].
   2.   The AC issuer's PKC MUST also conform to the profile specified
        in section 4.5 above.
   3.   The AC issuer MUST be directly trusted as an AC issuer (by
        configuration or otherwise).
   4.   The time for which the AC is being evaluated MUST be within the
        AC validity (if the evaluation time is equal to either
        notBeforeTime or notAfterTime then the AC is timely, i.e. this
        check succeeds). Note that in some applications, the evaluation
        time MAY not be the same as the current time.
   5.   The AC targeting check MUST pass (see section 4.3.2 above)
   6.   If the AC contains any "unsupported" critical extensions then
        the AC MUST be rejected.

   "Support" for an extension in this context means:

   a. the AC verifier MUST be able to parse the extension value, and,
   b. where the extension value SHOULD cause the AC to be rejected, the
   AC verifier MUST reject the AC.

   Additional Checks:

   1.   The AC MAY be rejected on the basis of further AC verifier
        configuration, for example an AC verifier may be configured to
        reject ACs which contain or lack certain attribute types.
   2.   If the AC verifier provides an interface that allows
        applications to query the contents of the AC, then the AC
        verifier MAY filter the attributes from the AC on the basis of
        configured information, e.g. an AC verifier might be configured
        not to return certain attributes to certain targets.

6. Revocation

   In many environments, the validity period of an AC is less than the
   time required to issue and distribute revocation information.
   Therefore, short-lived ACs typically do not require revocation
   support. However, long-lived ACs and environments where ACs enable
   high value transactions MAY require revocation support.

   The basic approach taken is to allow use of the following AC
   revocation related schemes.

   "Never revoke" scheme: ACs may be marked so that the relying party
   understands that no revocation status information will be made
   available. A noRevAvail extension as defined in section 4.3.6 above
   MUST be present in the AC to indicate this.

   Where no noRevAvail is not present, then the AC issuer is implicitly
   stating that revocation status checks are supported and some method
   MUST be provided to allow AC verifiers to establish the revocation
   status of the AC.

   "Pointer in AC" scheme: ACs may be marked (like PKCs) to "point" to
   sources of revocation status information (using an
   authorityInfoAccess or crlDistributionPoints extension in the AC
   itself).

   For AC users, the "never revoke" scheme MUST be supported, the
   "pointer in AC" scheme SHOULD be supported. If only the "never
   revoke" scheme is supported, then all ACs that do not contain a
   noRevAvail extension, MUST be rejected.

   For AC issuers, the "never revoke" scheme MUST be supported. If all
   ACs that will ever be issued by that AC issuer, will contain a
   noRevAvail extension, then the "pointer in AC" scheme NEED NOT be
   supported. If any AC can be issued that does not contain the
   noRevAvail extension, then the "pointer in AC" scheme MUST be
   supported.

   All conformant ACs MUST contain exactly one of the noRevAvail,
   authorityInformationAccess or crlDistributionPoints extensions. That
   is, the crlDistributionPoints, authorityInformationAccess and
   noRevAvail extensions are mutually exclusive for a single AC and an
   AC MUST NOT contain more than one of these extensions. This differs
   from the case with PKCs. An AC verifier MAY use other (e.g.
   configured) sources for AC revocation status information.

7. Optional Features

   This section specifies features that MAY be implemented. Conformance
   to this specification does NOT require support for these features.

7.1 Attribute Encryption

   Where an AC will be carried in clear within an application protocol
   or where an AC contains some sensitive information (e.g. a legacy
   application username/password) then encryption of AC attributes MAY
   be needed.

   When a set of attributes are to be encrypted within an AC, the
   cryptographic message syntax, EnvelopedData structure [CMS] is used
   to carry the ciphertext(s) and associated per-recipient keying
   information.

   This type of attribute encryption is targeted, which means that
   before the AC is signed the attributes have been encrypted for a set
   of predetermined recipients.

   The AC then contains the ciphertext(s) inside its signed data. The
   "enveloped-data" (id-envelopedData) ContentType is used and the
   content field will contain the EnvelopedData type.

   The set of ciphertexts is included into the AC as the value of an
   encrypted attributes attribute. Only one encrypted attributes
   attribute can be present in an AC - however it MAY be multi-valued
   and each of its values will contain an EnvelopedData.

   Each value can contain a set of attributes (each possibly a multi-
   valued attribute) encrypted for a set of recipients.

   The cleartext that is encrypted has the type:

      ACClearAttrs ::= SEQUENCE {
           acIssuer  GeneralName,
           acSerial  INTEGER,
           attrs     SEQUENCE OF Attribute
      }

   The DER encoding of the ACClearAttrs structure is used as the
   encryptedContent field of the EnvelopedData, i.e. the DER encoding
   MUST be embedded in an OCTET STRING.

   The acIssuer and acSerial fields are present to prevent ciphertext
   stealing - when an AC verifier has successfully decrypted an
   encrypted attribute it MUST then check that the AC issuer and
   serialNumber fields contain the same values. This prevents a
   malicious AC issuer from copying ciphertext from another AC issuer's
   AC into an AC issued by the malicious AC issuer.



Farrell & Housley                                            [Page 24]


INTERNET-DRAFT                                              March 2000


   The procedure for an AC issuer when encrypting attributes is
   illustrated by the following (any other procedure that gives the
   same result MAY be used):


      1.   Identify the sets of attributes that are to be encrypted for
           each set of recipients.
      2.   For each attribute set which is to be encrypted:
         2.1. Create an EnvelopedData structure for the data for this
              set of recipients.
         2.2. Encode the EnvelopedData as a value of the
              EncryptedAttributes attribute
         2.3. Ensure the cleartext attribute(s) are not present in the
              to-be-signed AC
      3.   Add the EncryptedAttribute (with its multiple values) to the
           AC

   Note that the rule that each attribute type (the OID) only occurs
   once may not hold after decryption. That is, an AC MAY contain the
   same attribute type both in clear and in encrypted form (and indeed
   more than once if the decryptor is a recipient for more than one
   EnvelopedData). One approach implementers may choose, would be to
   merge attributes values following decryption in order to re-
   establish the "once only" constraint.

      name      id-aca-encAttrs
      OID       { id-aca 6}
      Syntax    ContentInfo
      values    Multiple Allowed

   If an AC contains attributes apparently encrypted for the AC
   verifier then the decryption process MUST not fail - if decryption
   fails then the AC MUST be rejected.

7.2 Proxying

   In some circumstances, a server needs to proxy an AC when it acts as
   a client (for another server) on behalf of the AC holder. Such
   proxying may have to be under the AC issuer's control, so that not
   every AC is proxiable and so that a given proxiable AC can be
   proxied in a targeted fashion. Support for chains of proxies (with
   more than one intermediate server) is also sometimes required. Note
   that this does not involve a chain of ACs.

   In order to meet this requirement we define another extension,
   ProxyInfo, similar to the targeting extension.

   When this extension is present the AC verifier must check that the
   entity from which the AC was received was allowed to send it and
   that the AC is allowed to be used by this verifier.

   The proxying information consists of a set of proxy information,
   each of which is a set of targeting information. If the verifier and

Farrell & Housley                                            [Page 25]


INTERNET-DRAFT                                              March 2000


   the sender of the AC are both named in the same proxy set then the
   AC can be accepted (the exact rule is given below).

   The effect is that the AC holder can send the AC to any valid target
   which can then only proxy to targets which are in one of the same
   "proxy sets" as itself.

   The following data structure is used to represent the
   targeting/proxying information.

          ProxyInfo ::= SEQUENCE OF Targets

   As in the case of targeting, the targetCertificate and targetDigest
   fields MUST NOT be used.

   A proxy check succeeds if either one of the conditions below is met:

   1. 
     The identity of the sender as established by the underlying
     authentication service matches the holder field of the AC, and,
     the current server "matches" any one of the proxy sets (where
     "matches" is as defined for the targeting check in section 4.3.2
     above).

   2. 
     The identity of the sender as established by the underlying
     authentication service "matches" one of the proxy sets (call it
     set "A"), and, the current server is one of the targetName fields
     in the set "A", or, the current server is a member of one of the
     targetGroup fields in set "A".

   Where an AC is proxied more than once a number of targets will be on
   the path from the original client, which is normally, but not
   always, the AC holder. In such cases prevention of AC "stealing"
   requires that the AC verifier MUST check that all targets on the
   path are members of the same proxy set. It is the responsibility of
   the AC using protocol to ensure that a trustworthy list of targets
   on the path is available to the AC verifier.

      name           id-pe-ac-proxying
      OID            { id-pe 7 }
      syntax         ProxyInfo
      criticality    MUST be TRUE

7.3 Use of ObjectDigestInfo

   In some environments it may be required that the AC is not linked
   either to an identity (via entityName) or to a PKC (via
   baseCertificateID). The objectDigestInfo choice in the holder field
   allows support for this requirement.

   If the holder is identified via the objectDigestInfo field then the
   AC version field MUST contain v2 (i.e. the integer 1).



Farrell & Housley                                            [Page 26]


INTERNET-DRAFT                                              March 2000


   The basic idea is to link the AC to an object by placing a hash of
   that object into the holder field of the AC. For example, this
   allows production of ACs that are linked to public keys rather than
   names, or production of ACs which contain privileges associated with
   an executable object (e.g. a Java class).

   However, this profile only specifies how to use a hash over a public
   key or PKC, that is, conformant ACs MUST NOT use the
   otherObjectTypes value for the digestedObjectType.

   In order to link an AC to a public key the hash must be calculated
   over the representation of that public key which would be present in
   a PKC, specifically, the input for the hash algorithm MUST be the
   DER encoding of a SubjectPublicKeyInfo representation of the key.
   Note: This includes the AlgorithmIdentifier as well as the BIT
   STRING. The rules given in [PKIXPROF] and [ECDSA] for encoding keys
   MUST be followed. In this case the digestedObjectType MUST be
   publicKey and the otherObjectTypeID field MUST NOT be present.

   Note that if the public key value used as input to the hash function
   has been extracted from a PKC, then it is possible that the
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo from that PKC is NOT the value which should be
   hashed. This can occur if, e.g. DSA Dss-parms are inherited as
   described in section 7.3.3 of [PKIXPROF]. The correct input for
   hashing in this context will include the value of the parameters
   inherited from the CA's PKC, and thus may differ from the
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo present in the PKC.

   Implementations which support this feature MUST be able to handle
   the representations of keys for the algorithms specified in section
   7.3 of [PKIXPROF] and those specified in [ECDSA]. In this case the
   digestedObjectType MUST be publicKey and the otherObjectTypeID field
   MUST NOT be present.

   In order to link an AC to a PKC via a digest, the digest MUST be
   calculated over the DER encoding of the entire PKC (i.e. including
   the signature bits). In this case the digestedObjectType MUST be
   publicKeyCert and the otherObjectTypeID field MUST NOT be present.

7.4 AA Controls

   During AC validation a relying party has to answer the question: "is
   this AC issuer trusted to issue ACs containing this attribute?" The
   AAControls PKC extension, intended to be used in CA and AC Issuer
   PKCs, MAY be used to help answer the question.

   Note that this extension is quite likely to change in future based
   on experience with the use of ACs in the Internet.

         id-pe-aaControls OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pe 6 }

         AAControls ::= SEQUENCE {
            pathLenConstraint   INTEGER (0..MAX) OPTIONAL,

Farrell & Housley                                            [Page 27]


INTERNET-DRAFT                                              March 2000


            permittedAttrs      [0] AttrSpec OPTIONAL,
            excludedAttrs       [1] AttrSpec OPTIONAL,
            permitUnSpecified   BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
         }
         AttrSpec::= SEQUENCE OF OBJECT IDENTIFIER

   The aaControls extension is used as follows:

   The pathLenConstraint, if present, is interpreted as in [PKIXPROF],
   but now restricts the allowed "distance" between the AA CA, (a CA
   directly trusted to include AAControls in its PKCs), and the AC
   issuer.

   The permittedAttrs field specifies a set of attribute types that any
   AC issuer below this AA CA is allowed to include in ACs. If this
   field is not present, it means that no attribute types are
   explicitly allowed (though the permitUnSpecified field may open
   things up).

   The excludedAttrs field specifies a set of attribute types that no
   AC issuer is allowed to include in ACs. If this field is not
   present, it means that no attribute types are explicitly disallowed
   (though the permitUnSpecified field may close things down).

   The permitUnSpecified field specifies how to handle attribute types
   which are not present in either the permittedAttrs or excludedAttrs
   fields. TRUE (the default) means that any unspecified attribute type
   is allowed in ACs; FALSE means that no unspecified attribute type is
   allowed.

   Where aaControls are used then the following additional checks on an
   AA's PKC chain MUST all succeed for the AC to be valid:

   1.   Some CA on the AC's certificate path MUST be directly trusted
        to issue PKCs which precede the AC issuer in the certification
        path, call this CA the "AA CA".
   2.   All PKC's on the path from the AA CA down to and including the
        AC issuer's PKC MUST contain an aaControls extension as defined
        below (the PKC with the AA CA's as subject need not contain
        this extension).
   3.   Only those attributes in the AC which are allowed according to
        all of the aaControls extension values in all of the PKCs from
        the AA CA to the AC issuer, may be used for authorization
        decisions, all other attributes MUST be ignored (note that this
        check MUST be applied to the set of attributes following
        attribute decryption and that in such cases the id-aca-encAttrs
        type MUST also be checked).

      name           id-pe-aaControls
      OID            { id-pe 6 }
      syntax         AAControls
      criticality    MAY be TRUE

INTERNET-DRAFT                                              March 2000


8. Security Considerations

   Implementers MUST ensure that following validation of an AC, only
   attributes that the issuer is trusted to issue are used in
   authorization decisions. Other attributes, which MAY be present MUST
   be ignored. Given that the AA controls PKC extension is optional to
   implement, this means that AC verifiers MUST be provided with the
   required information by other means - e.g. by configuration. This
   becomes very important if an AC verified trusts more than one AC
   issuer.

   There is often a requirement to map between the authentication
   supplied by a particular protocol (e.g. TLS, S/MIME) and the AC
   holder's identity. If the authentication uses PKCs then this mapping
   is straightforward. However, it is envisaged that ACs will also be
   used in environments where the holder may be authenticated using
   other means. Implementers SHOULD be very careful in mapping the
   authenticated identity to the AC holder.

Appendix B: Object Identifiers

   This (normative) appendix lists the new object identifiers which are
   defined in this specification. Some of these are required only for
   support of optional features and are not required for conformance to
   this profile.

   This specification mandates support for OIDs which have arc elements
   with values that are less than 2^28, i.e. they MUST be between 0 and
   268,435,455 inclusive. This allows each arc element to be
   represented within a single 32 bit word. Implementations MUST also
   support OIDs where the length of the dotted decimal (see [LDAP],
   section 4.1.2) string representation can be up to 100 bytes
   (inclusive). Implementations MUST be able to handle OIDs with up to
   20 elements (inclusive). AA's SHOULD NOT issue ACs which contain
   OIDs that breach these requirements.

   The following OIDs are imported from [PKIXPROF]:

      id-pkix OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) identified-organization(3)
                dod(6) internet(1) security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) }
      id-mod  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pkix 0 }
      id-pe   OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pkix 1 }
      id-ad   OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pkix 48 }

   The following new ASN.1 module OID is defined:

      id-mod-attribute-cert        OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-mod 12 }

   The following AC extension OIDs are defined:

      id-pe-ac-auditIdentity       OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pe 4 }
      id-pe-ac-targeting           OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pe 5 }
      id-pe-ac-proxying            OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pe 7 }

   The following PKC extension OIDs are defined:

      id-pe-aaControls             OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pe 6 }

   The following attribute OIDs are defined:

      id-aca                       OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pkix 10 }
      id-aca-authenticationInfo    OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-aca 1 }
      id-aca-accessIdentity        OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-aca 2 }
      id-aca-chargingIdentity      OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-aca 3 }
      id-aca-group                 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-aca 4 }
      id-aca-encAttrs              OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-aca 6 }

Appendix C: Changes History

   <<This Appendix to be deleted after last call>>

   This appendix lists major changes since the previous revision.

   Major changes since last revision:

   Changes from -01 to -02

   1.      Re-Synchronized with X.509 DAM
   2.      Deleted AC chains concept
   3.      Moved AAControls to "optional features" section
   4.      Samples will be a separate draft
   5.      Revocation: now using X.509 DAM (noRevAvail) and standard 2459
           mechanisms only
   6.      Deleted the special wildcard target "ALL"

   Changes from -00 to -01

   1.      Re-structured conformance to profile + options as per Oslo
           consensus

   7.      Changed some syntax:
               Added UTF8String to IetfAttrSyntax value choice
               Split target & proxy extensions, removed owner from proxyInfo
   8.      Allocated PKIX OIDs (note: check with repository before using
           these, the PKIX arc is currently available at
           http://www.imc.org/ietf-pkix/pkix-oid.asn)
   9.      Added compiled ASN.1 module
