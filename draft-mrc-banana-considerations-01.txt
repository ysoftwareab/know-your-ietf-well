1.  Introduction

   There are currently several bandwidth aggregation solutions being
   discussed within the IETF or other parts of the Internet industry.
   This document discusses a number of technical and architectural facts
   that should be considered in the design and implementation of those
   solutions.  This document is intended to provide useful information
   to the community, not to state requirements or advocate for a
   particular solution.

Internet-Draft  Considerations for Bandwidth Aggregation       July 2016


   There is one simple thought underlying many of the considerations in
   this document: the goals of bandwidth aggregation are to increase the
   effective bandwidth available to customers and improve the
   reliability of customers' Internet access by using all of the
   available links, not just one of them.  Intuitively, two links should
   have more bandwidth and reliability than one link, but experience
   shows that it is actually quite hard to design a bandwidth
   aggregation solution that will achieve the desired goals in all
   cases, and quite easy to design a solution that will reduce the
   effective bandwidth or decrease the reliability of Internet access in
   an unacceptably high number of cases.  Many of the considerations in
   this document are intended to point out why that happens, so that
   solutions and implementations can avoid known pitfalls in this area.

   [Note: This document is a work in progress.  Feedback on the existing
   content is welcome, as well as feeback on other considerations that
   should be included.  Please send any feedback to the Bandwidth
   Aggregation mailing list: banana@ietf.org]

2.  What is Bandwidth Aggregation?

   [TBD]

3.  Taxonomy of Solutions

   This section attempts to catergorize bandwidth aggregation solutions
   along several axes, providing a taxonomy tbat we can use to describe
   and reason about individual solutions.  [Note: This section is
   largely TBD.]

3.1.  Tunnel-Based Solutions

   Many of the Bandwidth Aggregations currently under discussion are
   tunnel-based solutions.  They tunnel traffic over the links that are
   being aggregated, and recombine the traffic on the remote end.

   [Insert ASCII image of tunnel-based approach.]

   There is at least one proposal for Bandwith Aggregation (the MP-TCP-
   based approach) that does not use tunnels.  The considerations for
   tunnel-based solutions listed below may not apply to non-tunnel-based
   solutions.

3.2.  Per-Packet vs. Per-Flow Multiplexing

   The solutions currently under discussion use several different
   methods to determine which traffic will be sent over which interface.

Internet-Draft  Considerations for Bandwidth Aggregation       July 2016


   These methods can be grouped into two categories: per-packet
   multiplexing and per-flow multiplexing.

   Per-packet multiplexing aggregates the bandwidth by sending the
   desired proportion of packets over each interface.  In these
   solutions, packets from single flow (such as a TCP connection) may be
   split across multiple interfaces and will need to be recombined at
   the remote end.  However, the ability to multiplex on a per-packet
   basis makes it possible to most precisely apportion traffic across
   the available bandwidth.

   Per-flow multiplexing involves choosing a single interface for each
   flow (i.e.  TCP connection or application session) and sending all of
   the packets for a single flow across that interface.  In these
   solutions, the flow do not need to be combined on the remote end.
   However, the ability to balance traffic between multiple links may be
   limited if there are only a small number of traffice flows active.

4.  Considerations for All Solutions

   This section desribes potential issues that should be considered in
   the design and implementation of all bandwidth aggregation solutions.

4.1.  Link Characteristics and Performance

4.2.  Bypass Traffic

4.3.  Capped or Tariffed Interfaces

   In some cases, bandwith aggregation may be performed between
   dedicated links and links that have traffic caps or tarifs associated
   with additional use.  In these cases, customer may want to use
   bandwidth aggregation to increase the performance of some
   applications, while other applications (e.g. firmware upgrades or
   content downloads) may be limited to using the dedicated link.
   Solutions that wish to support this capability will need to support
   having a set of traffic that will be distributed using the bandwidth
   aggregation algorithms, and a set of traffic that will not.

4.4.  Learning from History (Multilink PPP)

   The IETF has a venerable, standard, implemented solution to this sort
   of problem: Multilink PPP.  Unfortunately, it is commonly said that
   experience with Multilink PPP did not find that it increased the
   effective bandwidth when it was used to share two indentical ISDN
   lines, compared to the bandwidth that was achieved from using only
   one line...

   [Note: We should attempt to determine if this is true and, if so,
   find any research papers or other documentation that might help us
   understand why this was true, so that we might learn from history.]

5.  Considerations for Tunnel-Based Solutions

5.1.  Tunnel Overhead

   Tunneling involves more overhead than sending non-tunnelled traffic
   for two reasons: the extra IP and tunnel headers that must be
   included in each packet, and any tunnel management traffic that must
   be exchanged.  This means that, in order to achieve increased
   effective bandwidth by aggregating traffic across more than one link,
   the raw bandwidth across multiple links must be higher than the
   bandwidth on a single link by a large enough margin to compensate for
   the tunnel overhead, so that increased effective bandwidth will
   result.

5.2.  MTU Issues

   There are a number of MTU Issues associated with all tunneling
   mechanisms, and there is a different set of MTU issues associated
   with any mechanism that changes the MTU of packets within a given
   flow.

   [Note: This section is TBD.]

5.2.1.  Fragmentation Issues

5.2.2.  Issues with MTU Changes

6.  Considerations for Per-Packet Solutions

6.1.  Packet Ordering

6.2.  Transport Layer Algorithms

   There are transport layer congestion control algorithms implemented
   in every TCP/IP stack.  It is the purpose of these algorithms to ramp
   up the speed of a TCP connection slowly, and to back off at the first
   sign of congestion (i.e. packet loss).  There are also algorithms
   which are designed to detect packet loss as quickly as possible by
   analyzing the protocol round-trip times, and deciding that a packet
   has been lost whenever there is a longer delay than expected before
   an acknowledgement is received.  Per-packet solutions run the risk of
   interacting pathologically with these algorithms.

Internet-Draft  Considerations for Bandwidth Aggregation       July 2016


   For example, if traffic from a single flow is being demultiplexed
   across two links with significantly different round-trip times (i.e.
   differnt latencies), the TCP retransmission algorithms may be
   triggered for packets that traverse the higher latency link.  This
   may cause the TCP congestion control algorithms to inaccurately
   detect congestion (even when neither link is congested) and slow down
   the speed of the TCP connetion.  In these cases, the throughput of
   each TCP connection may be reduced, thus reducing the performance of
   a customer's applications to the point where their applicaitons would
   have run faster over a single link.

   This problem can potentially be avoided by avoiding aggregation of
   links with significantly different latencies.  However, it may be
   desirable to perform bandwidth aggregation across those links in some
   cases.

7.  Considerations for Per-Flow Solutions

   This section describes some potential issues that should be
   considered in the design of per-flow bandwidth aggregation solutions.

7.1.  Granularity Issues

   Per-Flow demultiplexing is in widespread use for traffic engineering
   and load balancing in carrier and corporate networks.  Within those
   networks, there are a very large number of flows, so being able to
   direct traffic on a per-flow basis will generally be sufficient to
   achieve acceptable load-balancing or link aggregation.

   However, the number of flows generated by a single home or small
   office might not provide sufficient granularity to achieve the desire
   level of bandwidth aggregation.  Also some flows, such as streaming
   video flows, might use far more bandwidth than other, such as
   downloading a single image on a web page.  It is not always possible
   to predict which flows will be high-bandwidth flows, and which will
   require less bandwidth.

7.2.  Aggregated Flows

   Some Internet flows are aggregated into single, larger flows at the
   end-nodes.  This would include VPN traffic that is tunnelled to a
   corporate intranet, or other tunnelled traffic such as Teredo traffic
   for IPv6.  Use of these mechanisms can prevent proper classification
   of traffic into separate flows, thus exacerbating the granularity
   issues described above.

Internet-Draft  Considerations for Bandwidth Aggregation       July 2016


7.3.  Encrypted Traffic

   In some cases such as secure VPN traffic, the contents of packets may
   be encrypted in a way that does not allow a middlebox to see the
   transport-layer flow inforamtion (such as TCP or UDP ports).  In
   these cases, it might not be possible to properly separate multiple
   flows between a single set of endpoints.  This can exacerbate the
   granularity issues described above.

8.  Practical Considerations

8.1.  Use Available Information

   In many of the environments in which these mechanisms will be
   deployed, there is already considerable informaiton available about
   link quality, lost packets, traffic loads and effective bandwidth.
   It is possible to use that information to actively tune a bandwidth
   aggregation solution to achieve optimal effective bandwidth.  This
   information can also be used to detect situations in which the link
   quality of a secondary link is not sufficient to provide enough
   additional bandwidth to compensate for the bandwidth aggregation
   overhead.

8.2.  Theory is No Substitute for Experience

   Because of the complexity of the algorithms implemented at multiple
   layers of the TCP/IP Stack, many things that would appear to work in
   theory or in limited simulation do not have the expected results when
   deployed in a real-world environment.  Therefore, it would be highly
   desirable to have real-world experience running a bandwidth
   aggregation mechanism in an operational network before standardizing
   it within the IETF.

9.  Security Considerations

9.1.  Binding Tunnel Endpoints

10.  Appendix A: List of Solutions

   present) were provided by the proponents of each solution.  This list
