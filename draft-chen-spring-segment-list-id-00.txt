Abstract

   Segment Routing allows a node to steer a packet through an ordered
   list of instructions, called segments.  The ingress node prepends a
   SR header to a packet containing a set of "segments".  A segment can
   represent any instruction topological or service-based.

   The Segment Routing architecture can be implemented using MPLS with
   no change to the forwarding plane.  A segment is encoded as an MPLS
   label.  An ordered list of segments is encoded as a stack of labels,
   but it has implications on label stack depth.

   This document describes how to decrease the depth of the label stack
   in order to do effective Segment Routing operation.

1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR), as described in Draft
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing] allows a node to steer a packet
   through an ordered list of instructions, called segments.  This can
   be directly applied to the MPLS with no change on the forwarding
   plane.  A segment is encoded as an MPLS label.  An ordered list of
   segments is encoded as a stack of labels, but it has implications on
   label stack depth.

   There may be many specified nodes or links included in the path based
   on policy, and this will greatly increase the stack depth.If the
   label stack depth exceeds the LSR label stack processing
   capabilities, the hardware should be upgrade to support a deeper
   label stack capability.

   This document describes how to decrease the depth of the label stack
   in order to do effective Segment Routing operation.  It does not need
   to upgrade the hardware.

   SID:Segment Identifier

   SLID: Segment List Identifier, a segment list is identified by a
   Segment list ID (SLID).

   SRLD:specific Readable Label Depth

4.  Solutions considered

   There are two solutions described in the draft, both of them do not
   need to upgrade the hardware.

   In this document, we define the Segment List Identifier (SLID).  The
   segment list is identified by a Segment list ID (SLID).

   Segment list ID (SLID) is allocated by the controller.  The segment
   list and the SLID can be advertised to the related nodes.  The
   related nodes would be the jointing nodes, or all the segment nodes
   that contained in the segment list, or only be advertised to the
   ingress node.

   o  In the first case, the jointing nodes need to maintain the MPLS
      forwarding entry for the SLID.

   o  In the second case, each segment node needs to maintain the MPLS
      forwarding entry for the SLID.

   o  In the last case, the ingress node floods the SLID via the IGP to
      all the SR nodes in the SR domain and the SR node should maintain
      the SR list and the SLID mapping.  Each segment nodes that
      contained in the segment list would maintain the MPLS forwarding
      entry for the SLID.

4.1.  Jointing method

   The jointing method is based on the stack processing capability of
   each node.  The controller should have the capability to acquire the

   stack processing capability of each node.  It may be analyzed from
   the chip's version or from the node advertising.

   In the proposed mechanism, an unused ID from the SRGB is allocated by
   the controller to identify the segment list which is out of the stack
   processing capability.

   Let us analyze the following example:


                        +----------------------+
                  /-   _|      Controller      |   _
                 /   /  +----------------------+_   \
                /   /   |   |   |    |     | \    \   \
               /   /    |   |   |    |     |  \    \   \
         +---+    /  +---+  |   |  +---+   | +---+  \   \+---+
-------- |R1 |---/---|R3 |--|---|--|R5 |---|-|R7 |---\-- |R9 |
         +---+  /    +---+  |   |  +---+   | +---+    \  +---+
           |   /       |    /    \   |     \   |       \   |
           |  /        |   /      \  |      \  |        \  |
         +---+       +---+        +---+     +---+       +---+
         |R2 |-------|R4 |--------|R6 |-----|R8 |-------|R10|-----------
         +---+       +---+        +---+     +---+       +---+



                                 Figure 1

   In this example, we assumes that:

   o  Each node's chip version is the same, and the stack processing
      capability is 5.

   o  All nodes are SR capable.

   o  All SR nodes have the same SRGB consisting of: [100, 200]

   o  The operator (likely via the SDN Controller) as provisioned the
      Node-SIDs 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109,and 110
      respectively at nodes R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9 and R10.

   o  The controller computes a list for: {R1, R2, R4, R3, R5, R6, R8,
      R7, R9, and R10}, and allocates an unused ID 100 to identify the
      segment list.

   o  The controller advertises the binding Segment list ID (SLID) 100
      for segment list {R1, R2, R4, R3, R5, R6, R8, R7, R9, and R10} to
      the jointing nodes R1 and R5, or advertises the binding Segment

      list ID (SLID) 100 for partitioned segment list {R1, R2, R4, R3,
      and R5} to the jointing nodes R1 and Segment list ID (SLID) 100
      for partitioned segment list {R6, R8, R7, R9, and R10} to R5.

   Then, Node R1 maintains the following LIB entry:

   Incoming Label: NULL
   Label Operation: PUSH
   Outgoing Label: {102,104,103,105,100}
   Outgoing interface: port to R2


   Node R5 maintains the following LIB entry:

   Incoming Label: 105 &100
   Ingress Operation: POP and PUSH
   Outgoing Label: {106,108,107,109,110}
   Outgoing interface: R6


   Node R10 maintains the following LIB entry:

   Incoming Label: 110
   Ingress Operation: POP
   Outgoing Label: NULL
   Outgoing interface: NULL


   Other nodes are simple as following (i.e.R7):

   Incoming Label: 107&109
   Ingress Operation: POP and SWAP
   Outgoing Label: 109
   Outgoing interface: port to R9


   The following shows the progression of the packet as it enters and
   leaves the SR domain when the SLID is used.

   R1 encapsulates the SR header list{102,104,103,105,100}. R5 receives
   the packet, and converts 100 to the following list
   sequence{106,108,107,109,110}.R5 refreshs the SR header
   list{106,108,107,109,110}, and then the packet is transited to
   R6-R8-R7-R9-R10.

4.2.  Translation segment list to label stack method

   In this proposed mechanism, Segment list ID (SLID) is allocated by
   the controller.  The segment list and the SLID can be advertised to
   all the segment nodes that contained in the segment list, or only be
   advertised to the ingress node.

   A node N (Not the last segment node) maintains the following LIB
   entry:

    Incoming Active Segment: SRGB_Node_N[SL-SID]
    Label Operation: SWAP and PUSH (i.e. SWAP with SRGB_Node_N+1[SL-SID]
                     and PUSH the outer-label destination to next segment
                     Node_N+1)
    Outgoing interface: the interface towards the next-hop along the
                     shortest-path to Node_N+1


   Especially, if next segment is not a node segment but an adjacency
   segment, the label operation would only be SWAP (i.e.  SWAP with
   SRGB_Node_N+1[SL-SID], Node_N+1 is adjacency to Node_N.), and
   outgoing interface is determined by the adjacency.

   The last segment node M maintains the following LIB entry:

       Incoming Active Segment: SRGB_Node_M[SL-SID]
       Label Operation: POP
       Outgoing interface: NULL


   Entire outgoing label stack of the packet in Node N from outer to
   inner is as follows:


                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |   SRGB_nexthop[Node_N+1-SID]      |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |   SRGB_Node_N+1[SL-SID]           |
                   +-----------------------------------+


   Entire outgoing label stack in ingress node from outer to inner is as
   follows:

                   |     SRGB_nexthop[Node_ 1-SID]     |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |     SRGB_Node_1 [SL-SID]          |
                   +-----------------------------------+


   Note:Node 1 is the first node segment.

   Especially, if the first segment is not a node segment but an
   adjacency segment, the label stack would only be SRGB_Node_1 [SL-
   SID].  Node_1 is adjacency to ingress node.

   Then, any length of the segment list can be encoded as two-level
   label stacks.

   Let us analyze the following example:


                        +----------------------+
                  /-   _|      Controller      |   _

         +---+  /    +---+     |  +---+     +---+    \  +---+
           |   /               \    |                 \   |
           |  /                 \   |                  \  |
         +---+                    +---+                 +---+
         |R3 |--------------------|R4 |-----------------|R5 |-----------

                                 Figure 2

   An SDN Controller (SC) is connected to the network and is able to
   retrieve the topology and traffic information.

   We assume that:

   o  The operator (likely via the SDN Controller) as provisioned the
      Node-SIDs 101, 102, 103, 104, 105,and 106 respectively at nodes
      R0, R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5.

   o  The controller can steer the traffic from R0 to R5 an explicit
      path R1R2R5.  The controller allocates a binding Segment list ID
      (SLID) 300 for segment list {R1, R2, and R5}.

   o  The controller advertises the binding Segment list ID (SLID) 300
      for segment list {R1, R2, and R5} to all the segment nodes (i.e.
      R1, R2, and R5) that contained in the segment list.  Those
      extensions would be described in section 5.

   o  In this example, aLL nodes are SR capable, including A1/A2/A3.

   o  Each SR node may have a different SRGB.

   o  The next-hop along the shortest-path from R0 to R1 is A1.  A1 can
      also be LDP/ RSVP-TE/BGP capable (optional).  The next-hop along
      the shortest-path from R1 to R2 is A2.  A2 is either an SR node or
      LDP/RSVP-TE/BGP node.  The next-hop along the shortest-path from
      R2 to R5 is A3.  A3 is either an SR node or LDP/RSVP-TE/BGP node.

   o  Any length of the segment list is encoded as two-level label
      stacks.

   Then, Node R1 maintains the following LIB entry:

     Incoming Label: SRGB_R1 [300]
     Label Operation: SWAP and PUSH
     Outgoing Label: SRGB_R2 [300], SRGB_A2[103]
     Outgoing interface: port to A2


   Node R2 maintains the following LIB entry:

     Incoming Label: SRGB_R2[300]
     Label Operation: SWAP and PUSH
     Outgoing Label: SRGB_R5 [300], SRGB_A3[106]
     Outgoing interface: port to A2

   or simple as following (because R2 knows it is the penultimate
   segment of the segment list):

     Incoming Label: SRGB_R2 [300]
     Ingress Operation: SWAP
     Outgoing Label: SRGB_A 3[106]
     Outgoing interface: port to A3


   Node R5 maintains the following LIB entry:

     Incoming Label: SRGB_R5 [106]
     Ingress Operation: POP
     Outgoing Label: NULL
     Outgoing interface: NULL


   The following shows the progression of the packet as it enters and
   leaves the SR domain when the SLID is used.

   As an optional solution, the ingress node can also encode the label
   stack according to the global specific Readable label depth (SRLD).
   Also, the LIB entry (for SL-SID) in each segment node can swap the
   label stack according to SRLD.  This option will be specified in a
   future version.  The global SRLD can be configured, or it can be
   minimum Readable label depth of all the SR nodes.  The RLD has been
   specified in [I-D.kini-mpls-spring-entropy-label].

   The minimum Readable label depth of all the SR nodes can be learned
   via protocols.
