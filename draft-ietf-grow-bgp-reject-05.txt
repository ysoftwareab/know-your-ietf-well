1.  Introduction

   There are BGP routing security issues that need to be addressed to
   make the Internet more stable.  Route leaks [RFC7908] are part of the
   problem, but software defects or operator misconfigurations can
   contribute too.  This document provides guidance to BGP [RFC4271]
   implementers to improve the default level of Internet routing
   security.

   Many deployed BGP speakers send and accept any and all route
   announcements between their BGP neighbors by default.  This practice
   dates back to the early days of the Internet, where operators were
   permissive in sending routing information to allow all networks to
   reach each other.  As the Internet has become more densely
   interconnected, the risk of a misbehaving BGP speaker poses
   significant risks to Internet routing.

   This specification intends to improve this situation by requiring the
   explicit configuration of a BGP import and export policy for any
   External BGP (EBGP) session such as customers, peers, or
   confederation boundaries for all enabled address families.  When this
   solution is implemented, BGP speakers do not accept or send routes
   without policies configured on EBGP sessions.

2.  Solution

   The following requirements apply to all BGP speakers:

   o  A BGP speaker MUST consider any routes advertised by an EBGP peer
      ineligible for route selection (section 9.1.1 [RFC4271]), if no
      import policy was configured for the peer.

   o  A BGP speaker MUST NOT advertise any routes to an EBGP peer, if no
      export policy was configured for the peer.

   o  A BGP speaker SHOULD fall back to an "import nothing" and "export
      nothing" mode following failure of internal components, such as a
      policy engine.

   o  A BGP speaker MAY provide a configuration option to disable the
      preceding behaviors, but it MUST implement them by default.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document addresses a basic routing security issue caused by
   permissive default routing policy configurations.  Operators need
   implementers to address this problem with more secure defaults to
   mitigate collateral damage on Internet routing.  Inadvertent or
   adversarial advertisements cause business impact that can be
   mitigated by a secure default behavior.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
