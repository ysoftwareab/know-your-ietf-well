       Constrained Voucher Artifacts for Bootstrapping Protocols
                draft-ietf-anima-constrained-voucher-12

Abstract

   This document defines a protocol to securely assign a Pledge to an
   owner and to enroll it into the owner's network.  The protocol uses
   an artifact that is signed by the Pledge's manufacturer.  This
   artifact is known as a "voucher".

   This document builds upon the work in [RFC8366] and [BRSKI], but
   defines an encoding of the voucher in CBOR rather than JSON, and
   enables the Pledge to perform its transactions using CoAP rather than
   HTTPS.

   The use of Raw Public Keys instead of X.509 certificates for security
   operations is also explained.

1.  Introduction

   Secure enrollment of new nodes into constrained networks with
   constrained nodes presents unique challenges.  There are network
   bandwidth and code size issues to contend with.  A solution for
   autonomous enrollment such as BRSKI [RFC8995] may be too large in
   terms of code size or bandwidth required.

Internet-Draft             Constrained Voucher                 July 2021


   Therefore, this document defines a constrained version of the voucher
   artifact [RFC8366], along with a constrained version of BRSKI
   [RFC8995] that makes use of the constrained CoAP-based version of
   EST, EST-coaps [I-D.ietf-ace-coap-est] rather than EST over HTTPS
   [RFC7030].

   While the [RFC8366] voucher is by default serialized to JSON with a
   signature in CMS, this document defines a new voucher serialization
   to CBOR ([RFC7049]) with a signature in COSE
   [I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-struct].  This COSE-signed CBOR-encoded
   voucher can be transported using secured CoAP or HTTP.  The CoAP
   connection (between Pledge and Registrar) is to be protected by
   either OSCORE+EDHOC or DTLS (CoAPS).  The HTTP connection (between
   Registrar and MASA) is to be protected using TLS (HTTPS).

   This document specifies a constrained voucher-request artifact based
   on Section 3 of [RFC8995], and voucher(-request) transport over CoAP
   based on Section 3 of [RFC8995] and on [I-D.ietf-ace-coap-est].

   The CBOR definitions for the constrained voucher format are defined
   using the mechanism described in [I-D.ietf-core-yang-cbor] using the
   SID mechanism explained in [I-D.ietf-core-sid].  As the tooling to
   convert YANG documents into a list of SID keys is still in its
   infancy, the table of SID values presented here MUST be considered
   normative rather than the output of the pyang tool.

   There is additional work when the voucher is integrated into the key-
   exchange, described in [I-D.selander-ace-ake-authz].  This work is
   not in scope for this document.

2.  Terminology

   The following terms are defined in [RFC8366], and are used
   identically as in that document: artifact, domain, imprint, Join
   Registrar/Coordinator (JRC), Manufacturer Authorized Signing
   Authority (MASA), Pledge, Registrar, Trust of First Use (TOFU), and
   Voucher.

   The following terms from [RFC8995] are used identically as in that
   document: Domain CA, enrollment, IDevID, Join Proxy, LDevID,
   manufacturer, nonced, nonceless, PKIX.

3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

4.  Overview of Protocol

   [RFC8366] provides for vouchers that assert proximity, that
   authenticate the Registrar and that can offer varying levels of anti-
   replay protection.

   This document does not make any extensions to the semantic meaning of
   vouchers, only the encoding has been changed to optimize for
   constrained devices and networks.  The two main parts of the BRSKI
   protocol are named separately in this document: BRSKI-EST for the
   protocol between Pledge and Registrar, and BRSKI-MASA for the
   protocol between the Registrar and the MASA.

   Time-based vouchers are supported in this definition, but given that
   constrained devices are extremely unlikely to have accurate time,
   their use will be uncommon.  Most Pledges using these constrained
   vouchers will be online during enrollment and will use live nonces to
   provide anti-replay protection rather than expiry times.

   [RFC8366] defines the voucher artifact, while the Voucher Request
   artifact was defined in [RFC8995].  This document defines both a
   constrained voucher and a constrained voucher-request.  They are
   presented in the order "voucher-request", followed by a "voucher"
   response as this is the order that they occur in the protocol.

   The constrained voucher request MUST be signed by the Pledge.  It
   signs using the private key associated with its IDevID X.509
   certificate, or if an IDevID is not available, then the private key
   associated with its manufacturer-installed raw public key (RPK).
   Section 10 provides additional details on PKIX-less operations.

   The constrained voucher MUST be signed by the MASA.

   For the constrained voucher request this document defines two
   distinct methods for the Pledge to identify the Registrar: using
   either the Registrar's X.509 certificate, or using a raw public key
   (RPK) of the Registrar.

Internet-Draft             Constrained Voucher                 July 2021


   For the constrained voucher also these two methods are supported to
   indicate (pin) a trusted domain identity: using either a pinned
   domain X.509 certificate, or a pinned raw public key (RPK).

   The BRSKI architectures mandates that the MASA be aware of the
   capabilities of the pledge.  This is not a hardship as the pledges
   are constructed by a manufacturer who also arranges for the MASA to
   be aware of the inventory of devices.

   The MASA therefore knows if the pledge supports PKIX operations, PKIX
   format certificates, or if the pledge is limited to Raw Public Keys
   (RPK).  Based upon this, the MASA can select which attributes to use
   in the voucher for certain operations, like the pinning of the
   Registrar identity.  This is described in more detail in
   Section 8.2.3, Section 7 and Section 7.3 (for RPK specifically).

5.  BRSKI-EST Protocol

   This section describes the constrained BRSKI extensions to EST-coaps
   [I-D.ietf-ace-coap-est] to transport the voucher between Registrar
   and Pledge (optionally via a Join Proxy) over CoAP.  The extensions
   are targeting low-resource networks with small packets.

   The constrained BRSKI-EST protocol described in this section is
   between the Pledge and the Registrar only.

5.1.  Discovery, URIs and Content Formats

   To keep the protocol messages small the EST-coaps and constrained-
   BRSKI URIs are shorter than the respective EST and BRSKI URIs.

   The EST-coaps server URIs differ from the EST URIs by replacing the
   scheme https by coaps and by specifying shorter resource path names.
   Below are some examples; the first two using a discovered short path
   name and the last one using the well-known URI of EST which requires
   no discovery.

     coaps://server.example.com/est/<short-name>
     coaps://server.example.com/e/<short-name>
     coaps://server.example.com/.well-known/est/<short-name>

   Similarly the constrained BRSKI server URIs differ from the BRSKI
   URIs by replacing the scheme https by coaps and by specifying shorter
   resource path names.  Below are some examples; the first two using a
   discovered short path name and the last one using the well-known URI
   prefix which requires no discovery.  This is the same "/.well-known/
   brski" prefix as defined in [RFC8995] Section 5.

Internet-Draft             Constrained Voucher                 July 2021


     coaps://server.example.com/brski/<short-name>
     coaps://server.example.com/b/<short-name>
     coaps://server.example.com/.well-known/brski/<short-name>

   Figure 5 in section 3.2.2 of [RFC7030] enumerates the operations
   supported by EST, for which Table 1 in Section 5.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-ace-coap-est] enumerates the corresponding EST-coaps short
   path names.  Similarly, Table 1 provides the mapping from the
   supported BRSKI extension URI paths to the constrained-BRSKI URI
   paths.

             +=================+============================+
             | BRSKI resource  | constrained-BRSKI resource |
             +=================+============================+
             | /requestvoucher | /rv                        |
             +-----------------+----------------------------+
             | /voucher_status | /vs                        |
             +-----------------+----------------------------+
             | /enrollstatus   | /es                        |
             +-----------------+----------------------------+

                   Table 1: BRSKI URI paths mapping to
                       constrained BRSKI URI paths

   Note that /requestvoucher indicated above occurs between the Pledge
   and Registrar (in scope of the BRSKI-EST protocol), but it also
   occurs between Registrar and MASA.  However, as described in
   Section 5, this section and above table addresses only the BRSKI-EST
   protocol.

   Pledges that wish to discover the available BRSKI bootstrap options/
   formats, or reduce the size of the CoAP headers by eliminating the
   "/.well-known/brski" path, can do a discovery operation using
   [RFC6690] Section 4 by sending a discovery query to the Registrar.

   For example, if the Registrar supports a short BRSKI URL (/b) and
   supports the voucher format "application/voucher-cose+cbor" (TBD3),
   and status reporting in both CBOR and JSON formats:

     REQ: GET /.well-known/core?rt=brski*

     RES: 2.05 Content
     Content-Format: 40
     Payload:
     </b>;rt=brski,
     </b/rv>;rt=brski.rv;ct=TBD3,
     </b/vs>;rt=brski.vs;ct="50 60",
     </b/es>;rt=brski.es;ct="50 60"

Internet-Draft             Constrained Voucher                 July 2021


   The Registrar is under no obligation to provide shorter URLs, and MAY
   respond to this query with only the "/.well-known/brski/<short-name>"
   end points for the short names as defined in Table 1.

   Registrars that have implemented shorter URLs MUST also respond in
   equivalent ways to the corresponding "/.well-known/brski/<short-
   name>" URLs, and MUST NOT distinguish between them.  In particular, a
   Pledge MAY use the longer and shorter URLs in combination.

   When responding to a discovery request for BRSKI resources, the
   server MAY in addition return the full resource paths and the content
   types which are supported at those end-points as shown in above
   example.  This is useful when multiple content types are specified
   for a particular resource on the server.  The server responds with
   only the root path for the BRSKI resource (rt=brski, resource /b in
   above example) and no others in case the client queries for only
   rt=brski type resources.  (So, a query for rt=brski, without the
   wildcard character.)

   The return of multiple content-types in the "ct" attribute allows the
   Pledge to choose the most appropriate one.  Note that Content-Format
   TBD3 ("application/voucher-cose+cbor") is defined in this document.

   The Content-Format 50 ("application/json") MAY be supported and
   Content-Format 60 ("application/cbor") MUST be supported by the
   Registrar for the /vs and /es resources.  Content-Format TBD3 MUST be
   supported by the Registrar for the /rv resource.  If the "ct"
   attribute is not indicated for the /rv resource in the link format
   description, this implies that at least TBD3 is supported.

   The Pledge and MASA need to support one or more formats (at least
   TBD3) for the voucher and for the voucher request.  The MASA needs to
   support all formats that the Pledge, produced by that manufacturer,
   supports.

5.2.  Extensions to BRSKI

   A Pledge that only supports the BRSKI bootstrap method and already
   knows the IP address and port of a Registrar or Join Proxy to use
   SHOULD NOT use discovery.  In such case it is more efficient to just
   try its supported bootstrap method (e.g. /rv) via the well-known
   BRSKI resource on the known address and port.  This avoids the Pledge
   having to unnecessarily implement CoRE Link Format parsing.  The
   method via which the Pledge learns the address/port of a Registrar or
   Join Proxy to use is out of scope of this document.

Internet-Draft             Constrained Voucher                 July 2021


   A Registrar SHOULD host any discoverable BRSKI resources on the same
   (UDP) server port that the Pledge's initial DTLS connection is using.
   This avoids the overhead of the Pledge having to reconnect using
   DTLS, in order to access discovered resource(s).

5.3.  Extensions to EST-coaps

   A Pledge that already is DTLS-connected to either a Join Proxy or
   Registrar, and which only supports the EST-coaps enrollment method,
   SHOULD NOT use discovery for EST-coaps resources.  This is because it
   is more efficient to just try its supported enrollment method (e.g.
   /sen) via the well-known EST resource on the current DTLS connection.
   This avoids an additional round-trip of packets and avoids the Pledge
   having to unnecessarily implement CoRE Link Format parsing.

   A Registrar SHOULD host any discoverable EST-coaps resources on the
   same (UDP) server port that the Pledge's DTLS initial connection is
   using.  This avoids the Pledge having to reconnect using DTLS, in
   order to proceed with EST enrollment after the BRSKI bootstrap.  [TBD
   EDNOTE: a Registrar that does host EST resources on another port
   won't be able to onboard Pledges that skip the discovery, so not
   interoperable.  Should we fix this?]

5.3.1.  Pledge Extensions

   A constrained Pledge SHOULD NOT support the optional EST "CSR
   attributes request" (/att) to minimize network traffic and reduce
   code size.

   When creating the CSR, the Pledge selects which attributes to
   include.  One or more Subject Distinguished Name fields MUST be
   included.  If the Pledge has no specific information on what
   attributes/fields are desired in the CSR, it MUST use the Subject
   Distinguished Name fields from its IDevID unmodified.  The Pledge can
   receive such information via the voucher (encoded in a vendor-
   specific way) or some other, out-of-band means.

   A constrained Pledge MAY use the following optimized EST-coaps
   procedure to minimize both network traffic and code size:

   1.  if the voucher, that validates the current Registrar, contains a
       single pinned domain CA certificate, the Pledge provisionally
       considers this certificate as the EST trust anchor, in other
       words, it provisionally accepts this CA certificate as if it were
       the result of "CA certificates request" (/crts) to the Registrar.

Internet-Draft             Constrained Voucher                 July 2021


   2.  Using this CA certificate as trust anchor it proceeds with EST
       simple enrollment (/sen) to obtain its provisionally trusted
       LDevID.

   3.  If the Pledge validates that the trust anchor CA was used to sign
       its LDevID, the Pledge accepts the pinned domain CA certificate
       as the legitimate trust anchor CA for the Registrar's domain and
       accepts the associated LDevID.

   4.  If the trust anchor CA was NOT used to sign its LDevID, the
       Pledge MUST perform an actual "CA certificates request" (/crts)
       to the EST server to obtain the EST CA trust anchor(s) since
       these differ from the (temporary) pinned domain CA.

   5.  When doing this /crts request, the Pledge MAY use a CoAP Accept
       Option with value TBD287 ("application/pkix-cert") to limit the
       number of returned EST CA trust anchors to only one.

   6.  If the Pledge cannot obtain the single CA certificate or the
       finally validated CA certificate cannot be chained to the LDevID,
       then the Pledge MUST abort the enrollment process and report the
       error using the enrollment status telemetry (/es).

5.3.2.  Registrar Extensions

   The Content-Format 50 MAY be supported and 60 MUST be supported by
   the Registrar for the /vs and /es resources.  Content-Format TBD3
   MUST be supported by the Registrar for the /rv resource.

   When a Registrar receives a "CA certificates request" (/crts) request
   with a CoAP Accept Option with value TBD287 ("application/pkix-cert")
   it SHOULD return only the single CA certificate that is the
   envisioned or actual authority for the current, authenticated Pledge
   making the request.  The only exception case is when the Registrar is
   configured to not support a request for a single CA certificate for
   operational or security reasons, e.g. because every device enrolled
   into the domain needs to use multiple CAs.  In such exception case
   the Registrar returns the CoAP response 4.06 Not Acceptable to
   indicate that only the default Content-Format of 281 "application/
   pkcs7-mime;smime-type=certs-only" which supports multiple
   certificates is available.

6.  BRSKI-MASA Protocol

   [RFC8995] section 5.4 describes a connection between the Registrar
   and the MASA as being a normal TLS connection using HTTPS.  This
   document does not change that.  The Registrar MAY use the new format
   "application/voucher-cose+cbor" in its voucher request to MASA, or
   the existing BRSKI format "application/voucher-cms+json" defined by
   [RFC8995].  The MASA MUST support both formats.  The Registrar
   indicates the voucher format it wants to receive from MASA using the
   HTTP Accept header.

   At the moment of writing the creation of coaps based MASAs is deemed
   unrealistic.  The use of CoAP for the BRSKI-MASA connection can be
   the subject of another document.  Some consideration was made to
   specify CoAP support for consistency, but:

   *  the Registrar is not expected to be so constrained that it cannot
      support HTTPS client connections.

   *  the technology and experience to build Internet-scale HTTPS
      responders (which the MASA is) is common, while the experience
      doing the same for CoAP is much less common.

   *  in many Enterprise networks, outgoing UDP connections are often
      treated as suspicious, and there seems to be no advantage to using
      CoAP in that environment.

   *  a Registrar is likely to provide onboarding services to both
      constrained and non-constrained devices.  Such a Registrar would
      need to speak HTTPS anyway.

   *  similarly, a manufacturer is likely to offer both constrained and
      non-constrained devices, so there may in practice be no situation
      in which the MASA could be CoAP-only.  Additionally, as the MASA
      is intended to be a function that can easily be oursourced to a
      third-party service provider, reducing the complexity would also
      seem to reduce the cost of that function.

7.  Pinning in Voucher Artifacts

   The voucher is a statement by the MASA for use by the Pledge that
   provide the identity of the Pledge's owner.  This section describes
   how the owner's identity is determined and how it is encoded within
   the voucher.

7.1.  Registrar Identity Selection and Encoding

   Section 5.5 of [RFC8995] describes BRSKI policies for selection of
   the owner identity.  It indicates some of the flexibility that is
   possible for the Registrar.  The recommendation made there is for the
   Registrar to include only certificates in the voucher request (CMS)
   signing structure which participate in the certificate chain that is
   to be pinned.

   The MASA is expected to evaluate the certificates included by the
   Registrar in its voucher request, forming them into a chain with the
   Registrar's (signing) identity on one end.  Then, it pins a
   certificate selected from the chain.  For instance, for a domain with
   a two-level certification authority (see Figure 1), where the
   voucher-request has been signed by "Registrar", its signing structure
   includes two additional CA certificates:

    .------------------.
    |  domain CA (1)   |
    |  trust anchor    |
    '------------------'
              |
              v
       .------------.
       | domain (2) |
       | Sub-CA     |
       '------------'
              |
              |
              v
     .----------------.
     |   domain       |
     | Registrar (3)  |
     | EE certificate |
     '----------------'

                         Figure 1: Two-Level CA PKI

   When the Registrar is using a COSE-signed constrained voucher request
   towards MASA, instead of a regular CMS-signed voucher request, the
   COSE_Sign1 object contains a protected and an unprotected header.
   The Registrar MUST place all the certificates for the chain in an
   "x5bag" attribute in the unprotected header [I-D.ietf-cose-x509].

Internet-Draft             Constrained Voucher                 July 2021


7.2.  MASA Pinning Policy

   The MASA, having assembled and verified the chain in the signing
   structure of the voucher request, will now need to select a
   certificate to pin.  (For the case that only the Registrar's End-
   Entity certificate is included, only this certificate can be selected
   and this section does not apply.)  The BRSKI policy for pinning by
   the MASA as described in Section 5.5.2 of [RFC8995] leaves much
   flexibility to the manufacturer.  The present document adds the
   following rules to the MASA pinning policy to reduce the network
   load:

   1.  for a voucher containing a nonce, it SHOULD select the most
       specific (lowest-level) CA certificate in the chain.

   2.  for a nonceless voucher, it SHOULD select the least-specific
       (highest-level) CA certificate in the chain that is allowed under
       the MASA's policy for this specific domain.

   The rationale for 1. is that in case of a voucher with nonce, the
   voucher is valid only in scope of the present DTLS connection between
   Pledge and Registrar anyway, so it would have no benefit to pin a
   higher-level CA.  By pinning the most specific CA the constrained
   Pledge can validate its DTLS connection using less crypto operations.
   The rationale for pinning a CA instead of the Registrar's End-Entity
   certificate directly is the following benefit on constrained
   networks: the pinned certificate in the voucher can in common cases
   be re-used as a Domain CA trust anchor during the EST enrollment and
   during the operational phase that follows after EST enrollment, as
   explained in Section 5.3.1.

   The rationale for 2. follows from the flexible BRSKI trust model for,
   and purpose of, nonceless vouchers (Sections 5.5.* and 7.4.1 of
   [RFC8995]).

   Using the previous example of a domain with a two-level certification
   authority, the most specific CA ("Sub-CA") is the identity that is
   pinned by MASA in a nonced voucher.  A Registrar that wished to have
   only the Registrar's End-Entity certificate pinned would omit the
   "domain CA" and "Sub-CA" certificates from the voucher-request.

   In case of a nonceless voucher, the MASA would depending on trust
   level pin only "Registrar" certificate (low trust in customer), or
   the "Sub-CA" certificate (in case of medium trust, implying that any
   Registrar of that sub-domain is acceptable), or even the "domain CA"
   certificate (in case of high trust in the customer, and possibly a
   pre-agreed need of the customer to obtain flexible long-lived
   vouchers).

7.3.  Pinning of Raw Public Keys

   Specifically for constrained use cases, the pinning of the raw public
   key (RPK) of the Registrar is also supported in the constrained
   voucher, instead of an X.509 certificate.  If an RPK is pinned it
   MUST be the RPK of the Registrar.

   When the Pledge is known by MASA to support RPK but not X.509
   certificates, the voucher produced by the MASA pins the RPK of the
   Registrar in either the "pinned-domain-pubk" or "pinned-domain-pubk-
   sha256" field of a voucher.  This is described in more detail in
   Section 8.2.3.  A Pledge that does not support X.509 certificates
   cannot use EST to enroll; it has to use another method for enrollment
   without certificates and the Registrar has to support this method
   also.  It is possible that the Pledge will not enroll, but instead
   only a network join operation will occur, such as described in
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security].  How the Pledge discovers this
   method and details of the enrollment method are out of scope of this
   document.

   When the Pledge is known by MASA to support PKIX format certificates,
   the "pinned-domain-cert" field present in a voucher typically pins a
   domain certificate.  That can be either the End-Entity certificate of
   the Registrar, or the certificate of a domain CA of the Registrar's
   domain as specified in Section 7.2.  However, if the Pledge is known
   to also support RPK pinning and the MASA intends to pin the
   Registrar's identity (not a CA), then MASA SHOULD pin the RPK (RPK3
   in Figure 2) of the Registrar instead of the Registrar's End-Entity
   certificate to save space in the voucher.

    .------------.
    | pub-CA (1) |
    '------------'
           |
           v
    .------------.

                For example, a pledge might sign a proximity voucher,

                parties MAY examine the prior signed voucher

8.3.  Signing voucher and voucher-request artifacts with COSE

   The COSE-Sign1 structure is discussed in section 4.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-struct].  The CBOR object that carries the
   body, the signature, and the information about the body and signature
   is called the COSE_Sign1 structure.  It is used when only one
   signature is used on the body.  Support for ECDSA with sha256
   (secp256k1 and prime256v1 curves) is REQUIRED.  Support for EdDSA is
   encouraged.  [TBD EDNOTE: Expand and add a reference why. ]

   An example of the supported COSE-sign1 object structure is shown in
   Figure 3.

   COSE_Sign1(
     [
       h'A101382E',        # { "alg": EC256K1 }
       {
         "kid" : h'7890....1234'  # hash256(public key)
       },
       h'1234....5678', #voucher-request binary content
       h'4567....1234', #voucher-request binary public signature
     ]
   )

          Figure 3: cose-sign1 example in CBOR diagnostic notation

   The [COSE-registry] specifies the integers that replace the strings
   and the mnemonics in Figure 3.  The value of the key identifier "kid"
   parameter is an example value.  Usually a hash of the public key is
   used to identify the public key.  The choice of key identifier method

   is vendor-specific.  The public key and its hash are derived from the
   relevant certificate (Pledge, Registrar or MASA certificate).  [TBD
   EDNOTE: how can MASA know which kid method the Registrar has used/
   supports?  Does it matter?]

   In Appendix C a binary cose-sign1 object is shown based on the
   voucher-request example of Section 8.1.4.

9.  Design Considerations

   The design considerations for the CBOR encoding of vouchers are much
   the same as for JSON vouchers in [RFC8366].  One key difference is
   that the names of the leaves in the YANG definition do not affect the
   size of the resulting CBOR, as the SID translation process assigns
   integers to the names.

   Any POST request to the Registrar with resource /vs or /es returns a
   2.04 Changed response with empty payload.  The client should be aware
   that the server may use a piggybacked CoAP response (ACK, 2.04) but
   may also respond with a separate CoAP response, i.e. first an (ACK,
   0.0) that is an acknowledgement of the request reception followed by
   a (CON, 2.04) response in a separate CoAP message.

10.  Raw Public Key Use Considerations

   This section explains techniques to reduce the number of bytes that
   are sent over the wire during the BRSKI bootstrap.  The use of a raw
   public key (RPK) in the pinning process can significantly reduce the
   number of bytes and round trips, but it comes with a few significant
   operational limitations.

10.1.  The Registrar Trust Anchor

   When the Pledge first connects to the Registrar, the connection to
   the Registrar is provisional, as explained in section 5.6.2 of
   [RFC8995].  The Registrar provides its public key in a
   TLSServerCertificate, and the Pledge uses that to validate that
   integrity of the (D)TLS connection, but it does not validate the
   identity of the provided certificate.

   As the TLSServerCertificate object is never verified directly by the
   pledge, sending it can be considered superfluous.  Instead of using a
   (TLSServer)Certificate of type X509 (see section 4.4.2 of [RFC8446]),
   a RawPublicKey object is used.







Richardson, et al.       Expires 12 January 2022               [Page 26]

Internet-Draft             Constrained Voucher                 July 2021


   A Registrar operating in a mixed environment can determine whether to
   send a Certificate or a Raw Public key: this is determined by the
   pledge including the server_certificate_type of RawPublicKey.  This
   is shown in section 5 of [RFC7250].

   The Pledge continues to send a client_certificate_type of X509, so
   that the Registrar can properly identify the pledge and distill the
   MASA URI information from its certificate.

10.2.  The Pledge Voucher Request

   The Pledge puts the Registrar's public key into the proximity-
   registrar-pubk field of the voucher-request.  (The proximity-
   registrar-pubk-sha256 can also be used if the 32-bytes of a SHA256
   hash turns out to be smaller than a typical ECDSA key.)

   As the format of the pubk field is identical to the TLS Certificate
   RawPublicKey, no manipulation at all is needed to insert this into a
   voucher-request.

10.3.  The Voucher Response

   A returned voucher will have a pinned-domain-subk field with the
   identical key as was found in the proximity-registrar-pubk field
   above, as well as in the TLS connection.  Validation of this key by
   the pledge is what takes the DTLS connection out of the provisional
   state (see [RFC8995] section 5.6.2).

   The voucher needs to be validated first.  The Pledge needs to have a
   public key to validate the signature from the MASA on the voucher.

   In certain cases, the MASA's public key counterpart of the (private)
   signing key is already installed in the Pledge at manufacturing time.
   In other cases, if the MASA signing key is based upon a PKI (see
   [I-D.richardson-anima-masa-considerations] Section 2.3), then a
   certificate chain may need to be included with the voucher in order
   for the pledge to validate the signature.  In CMS signed artifacts,
   the CMS structure has a place for such certificates.  In the COSE-
   signed Constrained Vouchers described in this document, the x5bag
   attribute from [I-D.ietf-cose-x509] is to be used for this.

12.5.  Media Types Registry

   This section registers the 'application/voucher-cose+cbor' in the
   IANA "Media Types" registry.  This media type is used to indicate
   that the content is a CBOR voucher or voucher request signed with a
   COSE_Sign1 structure [I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-struct].

Appendix A.  Library support for BRSKI

   For the implementation of BRSKI, the use of a software library to
   manipulate certificates and use crypto algorithms is often
   beneficial.  Two C-based examples are OPENSSL and mbedtls.  Others
   more targeted to specific platforms or languages exist.  It is
   important to realize that the library interfaces differ significantly
   between libraries.

   Libraries do not support all known crypto algorithms.  Before
   deciding on a library, it is important to look at their supported
   crypto algorithms and the roadmap for future support.  Apart from
   availability, the library footprint, and the required execution
   cycles should be investigated beforehand.

   The handling of certificates usually includes the checking of a
   certificate chain.  In some libraries, chains are constructed and
   verified on the basis of a set of certificates, the trust anchor
   (usually self signed root CA), and the target certificate.  In other



Richardson, et al.       Expires 12 January 2022               [Page 34]

Internet-Draft             Constrained Voucher                 July 2021


   libraries, the chain must be constructed beforehand and obey order
   criteria.  Verification always includes the checking of the
   signatures.  Less frequent is the checking the validity of the dates
   or checking the existence of a revoked certificate in the chain
   against a set of revoked certificates.  Checking the chain on the
   consistency of the certificate extensions which specify the use of
   the certificate usually needs to be programmed explicitly.

   A libary can be used to construct a (D)TLS connection.  It is useful
   to realize that differences beetween (D)TLS implementations will
   occur due to the differences in the certicate checks supported by the
   library.  On top of that, checks between client and server
   certificates enforced by (D)TLS are not always helpful for a BRSKI
   implementation.  For example, the certificates of Pledge and
   Registrar are usually not related when the BRSKI protocol is started.
   It must be verified that checks on the relation between client and
   server certificates do not hamper a succeful DTLS connection
   establishment.

Appendix B.  Constrained BRSKI-EST messages

   This section extends the examples from Appendix A of
   [I-D.ietf-ace-coap-est] with the constrained BRSKI requests.  The
   CoAP headers are only worked out for the enrollstatus example.

B.1.  enrollstatus

   A coaps enrollstatus message can be :

       POST coaps://192.0.2.1:8085/b/es

   The corresponding CoAP header fields are shown below.

     Ver = 1
     T = 0 (CON)
     Code = 0x02 (0.02 is POST)
     Options
      Option  (Uri-Path)
        Option Delta = 0xb   (option nr = 11)
        Option Length = 0x1
        Option Value = "b"
      Option  (Uri-Path)
        Option Delta = 0x0   (option nr = 11)
        Option Length = 0x2
        Option Value = "es"
      Option  (Content-Format)
        Option Delta = 0x1   (option nr = 12)
        Option Length = 0x1
        Option Value = 60    (application/cbor)
     Payload Marker = 0xFF
     Payload = <binary CBOR enrollstatus document>

   The Uri-Host and Uri-Port Options are omitted because they coincide
   with the transport protocol destination address and port
   respectively.  TBD - Show the binary CBOR payload of this example.

   A 2.04 Changed response from the Registrar will then be:

      2.04 Changed

   With CoAP fields:

      Code = 0x44 (2.04 Changed)

B.2.  voucher_status

   A coaps voucher_status message can be:

      POST coaps://[2001:db8::2:1]:61616/b/vs
        Content-Format: 60 (application/cbor)
        Payload =

   696f6e616c20696e666f726d6174696f6e
   <CODE ENDS>

   The request payload above is binary CBOR but represented here in
   hexadecimal for readability.  Below is the equivalent CBOR diagnostic
   format.

   {"version": 1, "status": false,
   "reason": "Informative human-readable error message",
   "reason-context": { 0: "Additional information" } }

   <CODE ENDS>

   A 2.04 Changed response without payload will then be sent by the
   Registrar back to the Pledge.
