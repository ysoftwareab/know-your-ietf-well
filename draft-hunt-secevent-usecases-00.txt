1.  Introduction and Overview

   SCIM is a system intended for provisioning identities (such as
   enterprise users or consumers) and other objects across security
   domains to a cloud based service providers.  SCIM defines an
   extensible JSON [RFC7643] document format and profiles HTTP protocol
   [RFC7644].  In practice, SCIM service providers are applications
   supporting pre-provisioning support, or may be a service provider
   directory upon which applications are integrated.

   This document defines the operational requirements SCIM deployers
   have for the use of triggers, as defined in the SCIM Use Cases
   specification [RFC7642], and used in the form of security events and
   the requirements for management based on SCIM architectural
   assumptions.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] . These
   keywords are capitalized when used to unambiguously specify
   requirements of the protocol or application features and behavior
   that affect the inter-operability and security of implementations.
   When these words are not capitalized, they are meant in their
   natural-language sense.

   For purposes of readability examples are not URL encoded.
   Implementers MUST percent encode URLs as described in Section 2.1 of
   [RFC3986] .

   Throughout this documents all figures MAY contain spaces and extra
   line-wrapping for readability and space limitations.  Similarly, some
   URI's contained within examples, have been shortened for space and
   readability reasons.

1.2.  Definitions

   This specification assumes terminology defined in the Security Event
   Token specification[I-D.ietf-secevent-token] .

   This specification assumes terminology defined in the SCIM
   specifications, specifically [RFC7643] and [RFC7644]

   This specification defines the following terms:

   Directory
      Defined as any centralized repository of security objects shared
      by multiple applications.  A SCIM Directory, though not formally
      defined is simply a directory that supports SCIM protocol.

2.  SCIM Background

   The SCIM Core Schema specification [RFC7643] is a profile of JSON
   [RFC7159] that defines attribute types, mutability, data formats,
   composites, and multi-value attributes as well as SCIM Service
   Provider feature and schema discovery metadata.  As core schema
   defines standard resource types: Users and Groups which are common to
   most service providers.  Each resource type establishes a common set
   of attribute definitions that can be mapped to SAML [saml-core-2.0]
   and to OpenID Connect [openid-connect-core] as well as application
   specific attributes.  The core schema specification provides an
   extension mechanism which has been popular in:




Hunt & Ansari            Expires January 1, 2018                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft        draft-hunt-secevent-usecases             June 2017


   o  Being extended to describe many security objects such as OAuth
      Clients, Applications, IoT objects, among others.

   o  Enabling localized extensions to standard resource types (e.g.
      Users) without compromising inter-operability of existing
      implementations.

   The SCIM Protocol specification [RFC7644] describes a RESTful profile
   of HTTP [RFC7231] that defines create, read, update and delete life-
   cycle for resources.  The processing rules follow Jon Postel's
   "Robustness Principle" (see Section 2.10 [RFC761]) which help avoid
   many of the failings of previous XML based approaches.  In particular
   the use of robust RESTful JSON helped ensure client and server
   ability to deal with inter-domain differences in schema, data, and
   implementation avoiding a lot of per implementation/deployment custom
   connector approaches.

   SCIM clients use HTTP requests to SCIM service providers as follows
   to:

   o  Query for resources (users and groups) based on filters using HTTP
      GET or confidentially using HTTP POST.

   o  Retrieve specific resources using HTTP GET.

   o  Create new resources using HTTP POST.

   o  Replace a resource using HTTP PUT.

   o  Update a resource using HTTP PATCH.  And,

   o  Delete a resource using HTTP DELETE.

   The SCIM Protocol defines capabilities for:

   o  Complex or composite attributes that contain multiple values and
      the need to select and update specific values.  This includes how
      to express sub-attributes and values in filters and the ability to
      change them as part of a resource.  An example of a composite
      attribute in SCIM is: addresses (e.g. street name, city, country).
      Note: In SECEVENTs a corresponding example complex/composite
      attribute is an OpenID Connect user which is identified by both
      'sub' and 'iss'.

   o  How to handle attributes that are immutable or read-only in the
      context of operations like PUT.  How to handle attributes that are
      hashed or write-only and cannot be retrieved.

   o  Flexibility for web applications to take what they want without
      having traditional schema enforcement as with XML Schema.

   o  How to handle identifiers between clients and service providers
      and across domains.

   o  Referential stability of resources over time.

3.  High-Level Requirements

3.1.  SCIM Event Trigger Requirements

   SCIM's need for Security Events arises from a requirement for
   triggers identified in the SCIM Use Case specification [RFC7642].
   Clients and service providers that operate across security domains
   have independent resource management that causes co-ordination and
   governance challenges between domains.  The use of triggers is
   intended to alert clients (e.g. enterprises) of state changes within
   service providers that may be of interest to SCIM clients that may
   need to be co-ordinated or reconciled across domains.

   As a general example, a change to a resource that occurs within a
   cloud software as a service (SaaS) provider generates an Event to be
   sent to a registered recipient via an Event Stream.  Upon receipt of
   the event, the receiver performs a SCIM GET to obtain additional
   information and then decide if a local update or other action is
   required.

3.2.  SCIM Security Model Considerations

   Authentication and Authorization
      SCIM follows normal authentication and authorization practices for
      HTTP (See Sections 2 and 7 [RFC7644]).  In typical deployed cases,
      access to SCIM endpoints is managed by OAuth authorization in both
      cross-domain provisioning, delegated administration, and self-
      service applications.  Many integrators also support basic
      authentication, and TLS mutual authentication.  SCIM is often
      accessed in a couple of ways:

      *  End-user servers (e.g. as facilitated via a /Me endpoint) via a
         self-service web application or Javascript client.




Hunt & Ansari            Expires January 1, 2018                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft        draft-hunt-secevent-usecases             June 2017


      *  Administrative - where an administrator identity has access to
         groups of objects they are entitled to administer.

      *  Server-to-server, where identity provisioning systems
         implementing management workflows initiate commands across
         domains using OAuth enabled authorization.

   PII Confidentiality
      Querying using personally identifiable information (PII) causes
      privacy concerns when using HTTP GET.  In typical HTTP usage,
      since HTTP [RFC7231] does not allow for query payloads on an HTTP
      GET, query parameters and filters are typically passed as part of
      the URL.  When queries contain PII (most will in the case of
      RISC), there are security issues (e.g. leakage via audit logs and
      browser histories) relating to passing filter terms that contain
      PII in URLs.  See [RFC7642] Security Considerations, section
      7.5.2.  From the perspective of SECEVENTs, the SCIM community has
      the same PII requirement that the management of SECEVENT streams
      and delivery not pass PII in request URIs.

   Scale, PII, and Multi-Valued Data
      One of the concerns the SCIM working group had when developing
      SCIM was the challenge that Groups (e.g. a group of users) will
      tend to get very big at Internet scale.  The bigger a Group gets,
      the more expensive it is to enumerate.  With a high change rate it
      quickly become impractical to do a simple PUT to replace an entire
      Group object due to the likely number of independent update
      conflicts that would occur.  To avoid this, implementers often:

      *  Severely restrict when clients are actually authorized to
         return large objects (million member groups).

      *  Set access policy to allow search filters that confirm
         membership but avoid returning the members attribute (to avoid
         enumeration of all values).

      *  Use HTTP PATCH (a derivative of JSON Patch) to remove or add
         specific subjects without having to know the entire contents
         (e.g. the group).

3.3.  Control Plane Assumptions

   In the original SCIM identity event proposals, "Control Plane"
   functionality was accomplished by SCIM.  SCIM protocol was proposed
   to configure and provision "streams" that deliver events via other
   protocols or profiles.  The SCIM proposal allowed Event Receivers to
   check for delivery problems by retrieving Stream "resources" (which
   contain the stream configuration attributes) of which "status" is an



Hunt & Ansari            Expires January 1, 2018                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft        draft-hunt-secevent-usecases             June 2017


   attribute that could be used to report operational state of a stream.
   Updates to Stream resource enable Event Recipients to do things like
   rotate credentials, or suspend streams.  To initiate a verification
   to test a stream is functional, the Receiver or an authorized
   administrator can modify the Stream resource to "request" a verify by
   changing the value of "status" to "verify".  In SCIM the subjects in
   a stream can be identified by a number of methods:

   o  Members of a Group

   o  The addition of a "streams" attribute to Users and other objects
      that may be part of a stream.

   o  An attribute or filter condition.  E.g. the members of a Stream
      are defined by those Users with entitlements or roles containing a
      specific value (e.g. "entitlements" eq "CRM").

   The SCIM WG in re-using SCIM as the control plane had assumed the
   following is already defined (and any alternative proposal would have
   to support):

   o  Defined processing of attributes based on type, mutability, etc
      for each HTTP method.  For example, the handling of omitted
      attributes in a PUT or POST operation.  Is a value intended to be
      defaulted or set to null?

   o  Handling of extensibility semantics as defined in the SCIM
      specifications such as the definition of new resource types
      (objects) and addition of new attributes by other profiling
      specifications.

   o  The ability of a service provider to override or modify client
      provider asserted values.

   o  Identifier and resource URI stability and referential integrity.

   o  Querying of subjects using various standard identifiers such as
      "id", "emails", "telephoneNumbers", etc.  The ability to express
      composite queries such as "sub" and "iss" in a query.

   o  Ability to add and remove subjects from a group while keeping
      enumeration of that group from the client.  Ability to confirm
      membership in a group without enumeration (facilitated through
      support for write-only/compare-only schema or access control).

   o  Standardized error control, handling and processing rules.  See
      Section 3.12 [RFC7644] and [RFC7231].

3.4.  Network and Protocol Operational Considerations

   The SCIM WG discussed that transmission (now called data-plane or
   stream) can have much simpler semantics and error conditions and thus
   did not need to profile JSON beyond simple SET transfer (no need for
   attribute types, filters, etc).  The SCIM WG also anticipated some
   varied requirements for delivery that include:

   o  PUSH delivery via HTTP POST (the generally preferred ideal
      solution).

   o  POLLING (to enable delivery across firewalls) using HTTP GET.

   o  PUSH delivery via messaging systems like APNS, GMS, SMS, etc -
      many of these had to do with provisioning and entitlement signals
      for mobile applications (e.g.  WebEx).  For example user contacts
      synchronization where after a change to a user's contact list, an
      application can receive an Event notification through the mobile
      platform's messaging solution as a trigger to fetch changes.

3.5.  Dynamic Filtering Considerations

   When defining filtered Streams, SCIM has to consider some special
   cases when the contents of a Stream is based upon a filter (query) to
   define which affected resources are included.  For example, if the
   contents of a Stream is defined as Events related to resources where
   "emails.value sw "A"" and a resource is deleted, then the deleted
   resource won't match the filter anymore but notification may still
   need to be sent.

3.6.  Directory and Application Provisioning

   Network relationships for connections are typically:

   o  Enterprise Directory to Cloud Directory.

   o  Cloud Directory to Cloud Directory.

   o  Enterprise or Cloud to Cloud Application (applications used by
      many users).

   o  Enterprise or Cloud to Mobile Application (applications running on
      a device controlled by a single user).

   An enterprise directory is typically (but not always) legacy-LDAP.
   In the cloud, a directory is simply any shared centralized profile
   store (e.g.  Google Dir, Azure Directory/OpenGraph, SCIM Directory,
   etc).  Important: While for many organizations LDAP remains the



Hunt & Ansari            Expires January 1, 2018                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft        draft-hunt-secevent-usecases             June 2017


   center of administrative control, it is important to note that cloud
   directories and applications hold significantly more PII than
   enterprise directories.  This creates a challenge for enterprise
   organizations to ensure proper governance and management of data
   given that a lot of cloud data is independently managed and updated.

   As with an enterprise directory, a cloud directory is often shared by
   multiple applications.  Cloud directories not only contain
   entitlement information but now also contain CRM data, contact,
   credentials, personalization and localization data, social network
   data, etc (the list goes on).  While some cloud providers centralize
   others are tenancy structured with different directory endpoints per
   tenancy (e.g.  Oracle).

   As described above, because data, particularly PII, is being
   independently managed across multiple domains, there is a need to
   generate change signals (events) from cloud based directories and
   applications back to the enterprise.  This was originally identified
   in the SCIM Use Cases (see Section 2.2.1 [RFC7642]).

4.  Use Cases

   The following use cases are expressed in terms of the direction of
   flow of events.  In typical SCIM cases, there is only 1-way event
   exchange.  Typical usage of events is to act as a "trigger" (see
   [RFC7642]) to let a receiver know that an event has occurred in the
   transmitter's domain that may require action on the part of the
   receiver.  Events can be simple resource changed events, to higher
   level account status and change events (e.g.  account or password
   reset).  While many events are similar to OpenID RISC proposed
   events, a major distinction is that SCIM events are often triggered
   by user, administrative, or workflow provisioning action rather than
   a risk analytical engine (e.g. that might detect suspicious
   activity).

4.1.  Scenario 1[P0]: Cloud-to-Enterprise PUSH and Cloud-to-Cloud PUSH

   Pre-conditions:

      The Event Receiver already has SCIM access to the Event
      Transmitter service provider.  This includes HTTP credentials and
      endpoint.

      Event Receivers and Transmitters can agree out-of-band on SET/JWT
      security requirements including use of signing and/or encryption
      to be documented in a Stream Configuration.

              Figure 1: SCIM Provisioining with PUSH Triggers

   In Figure 1, the SCIM client initiates RESTful SCIM commands to a
   SCIM service provider.  In addition to provisioning security objects
   such as Users and Groups, the client also uses SCIM to provision
   Event Streams in order to receive Events to an endpoint the
   provisioning controller requests.  The service provider MUST be able
   to POST to the client's domain.  Usually this means the client is
   able to have a public HTTP endpoint available to receive SET events.

   Stream Creation Flow:

   To create a Stream, the Event Receiver (or an administrator) uses
   their SCIM access credential to access the SCIM endpoint and creates
   a Stream resource configuration:

   POST /Streams
   Host: scim.bighost.com
   Authorization: Bearer h480djs93hd8
   { "receiverId":"<client-id>",
     "method":"webCallBack",
     "receiverUri":"https://set.example.com/events/",
     "aud":"<client-id>",
     "type":"SCIM",
     "receiverJwkUri":"<receiver's public key url>",
     "authorization":"<btoken|BasicAuth>"
   }

Internet-Draft        draft-hunt-secevent-usecases             June 2017


   Note: If the Transmitter does not have an HTTP credential to send
   events, the receiver should include one in its registration POST
   request or negotiate one out-of-band.

   In the stream configuration there is likely a definition as to what
   types of events (event families) and which subjects constitute the
   feed.  In SCIM this will likely be a group of objects, or filter
   condition such as "roles" eq "CRM_Users".  This is likely based on
   the relationship between parties that determines which entities are
   provisioned between domains.

   Upon successful creation of the Stream, the SCIM Event Transmitter
   Responds with:

   HTTP/1.1 201 Created
   Location: https://events.bighost.com/Streams/2819c223-7f76-453a
   { "receiverId":"<client-id>",
     "method":"webCallBack",
     "receiverUri":"https://set.example.com/events/",
     "aud":"<client-id>",
     "type":"SCIM",
     "receiverJwkUri":"<receiver's public key url>",
     "authorization":"<btoken|BasicAuth>",
     "status":"on"
   }

   Note that in the above figure, the Location URI is the fixed
   reference to the Stream for as long as it exists.  Administrative
   users and Event Receiver entities MAY use the location to check
   status or update configuration as needed.

                    Figure 3: Stream Creation Response

   [[TBD, the event receiver, needs to issue the event transmitter a
   credential in order for it to issue HTTP POSTs to the Event Receivers
   callback endpoint.  In some cases there may be an existing OpenID
   Connect relationship but in most cases this not expected - especially
   in directory-to-directory synchronization scenarios.]]

   Stream Verification:

   During the initial stream creation request and at any point the
   transmitter deems appropriate (e.g. as a ping), the transmitter
   verifies configuration by sending a verification event to the
   receiver that demonstrates the receiver:

   o  is willing accept the event, and

Internet-Draft        draft-hunt-secevent-usecases             June 2017


   o  is able to parse the event - especially if encrypted.

   Conversely an Event Receiver should be able to initiate a
   verification request and may provide a confirmation challenge and
   nonce to verify the relationship from the Event Receiver's
   perspective.

   Delivery:

   Delivery is accomplished by doing a simple HTTP POST to the
   registered endpoint of the receiver.  The payload of the POST is
   application/jwt and contains a single JWT (which is actually a SET).

   Before responding with a 2xx success message, the receiver should
   ensure it was able to read and validate the SET.  If the transmitter
   receives a 2xx response, the transmitter may assume the event was
   successfully delivered.

   A set of Status 400 error conditions are defined which the receiver
   can use to indicate various JWT validation conditions.

4.2.  Scenario 2[P0]: Cloud-to-Enterprise POLLING

   Pre-conditions:

      The Event Receiver already has SCIM access to the Event
      Transmitter service provider.  This includes HTTP credentials and
      endpoint.

      Event Receivers and Transmitters can agree out-of-band on SET/JWT
      security requirements including use of signing and/or encryption
      to be documented in a Stream Configuration.

      The Event Receiver is unable to open an endpoint to receive SETs
      inside the firewall.

                  Figure 4: Event Delivery with Firewall

   In Figure 4, the SCIM client initiates RESTful SCIM commands to a
   SCIM service provider.  In addition to provisioning security objects
   such as Users and Groups, the client also uses SCIM to provision
   Event Streams in order to receive Events to an endpoint the
   provisioning controller requests.  In this case, the SCIM Client
   "polls" for events using HTTP GET.  The client MAY request immediate
   response based on a timed schedule, or the client MAY use HTTP Long
   Polling to wait for SETs as they become available.

   Stream Creation Flow:

   The Event Receiver uses their SCIM credential to access the SCIM
   service provider endpoint to create a Stream resource by performing a
   POST

   POST /Streams
   Host: scim.bighost.com
   Authorization: Bearer h480djs93hd8
   { "receiverId":"<client-id>",
     "method":"POLLING",
     "aud":"<client-id>",
     "type":"SCIM",
     "receiverJwkUri":"<receiver's public key url>"
   }

   It is assumed, but may not always be true. that the POLLING receiver
   can simply use their SCIM credential to perform HTTP GETs to the
   polling endpoint.  Additional parameters will likely need to be
   defined to control polling rate, number of events in a message, etc.

   Note, in the stream configuration there is likely a definition as to
   what types of events (event families) and which subjects constitute
   the feed.  In SCIM this will likely be a group of objects, or filter
   condition such as "roles" eq "CRM_Users".  This is likely based on
   the relationship between parties that determines which entities are
   provisioned between domains.

   Upon successful creation of the stream, the transmitter responds to
   the receiver with:

   HTTP/1.1 201 Created
   Location: https://events.bighost.com/Streams/2819c223-7f76-453a
   { "receiverId":"<client-id>",
     "method":"POLLING",
     "receiverUri":"https://set.bighost.com/Events/2819c223-7f76-453a",
     "aud":"<client-id>",
     "type":"SCIM",
     "receiverJwkUri":"<receiver's public key url>",
     "status":"on"
   }

                Figure 6: Polling Stream Creation Response

   In the above response, the transmitter indicates to the receiver
   where to poll for events by setting a value for "receiverUri".  This
   endpoint does not need to be SCIM compliant and can be a generic
   (e.g. shared by all polliers) endpoint such as
   "https://events.bighost.com".

   Stream Verification:

   Same requirements are for Scenario 1 (see Section 4.1).

   Delivery:

   Delivery is accomplished by having the Event Receiver initiate an
   HTTP request that causes a response such as:

   In the above JSON object is a JSON attribute "sets" whose value is a
   JSON object that contains a set of JSON attributes that correspond to
   each event's JTI value. the value for each attribute is the actual
   encoded SET.

   In addition to the "sets" attribute, a "since" attribute indicates
   the timestamp of either the last event previously transmitted or
   potentially oldest event in the current payload (To be discussed).

   In order to acknowledge receipt, the receiver must successfully parse
   each message and respond by doing an HTTP POST back to the events
   endpoint using something along the lines of the following JSON
   structure:

       }
     }
   }

                  Figure 8: Poll Acknowledgement Response

   In the payload above the receiver indicates which SET event JTIs have
   been accepted, and which SETs had errors using "accepts" and
   "setErrs".

   It is expected that because most errors are due to JWT crypto
   configuration errors, that most responses will tend to be all errors
   or all accepts.

   If a transmitter receives what it deems an unrecoverable error, or a
   receiver fails to poll for events, the transmitter can set the stream
   state to "failed" with an appropriate error indicator.

4.3.  Scenario 3[P2]: Cloud-to-Mobile Application PUSH

   This scenario is a hybrid of scenario 1 and 2.  The scenario uses
   mobile message delivery services (APNS, GMS, SMS) to deliver events.
   Typically a stream has only one subject in its feed.  The events are
   used to notify client applications about changes to entitlements, or
   other configuration (e.g. new tenancy endpoints)that might be useful
   to user experience.

   As in the polling method in Scenario 2, to acknowledge events, the
   mobile app will need to use the POST (as defined in Scenario 2) to
   acknowledge SET delivery.  To be discussed, this might not be
   necessary if assured delivery is not required.
