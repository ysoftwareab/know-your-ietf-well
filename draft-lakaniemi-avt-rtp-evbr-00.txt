1. Introduction 

   The International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) recommendation 
   G.xxx [ev-vbr] specifies the Embedded Variable Bit Rate (EV-VBR) 
   speech/audio codec. This document specifies the Real-time Transport 
   Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550] payload format for this codec. 

2. Background 

2.1. EV-VBR codec 

   EV-VBR is an embedded variable rate speech codec having a layered 
   design. This implies that the bitstream of the EV-VBR core codec 
   consists of a core layer, denoted as L1, and four enhancement layers, 
   denoted as L2-L5. The bit-rates of the EV-VBR core codec range from 8 
   kbit/s (core layer only) to 32 kbit/s (with all layers up to L5). 
   Furthermore, the EV-VBR codec supports also discontinuous 
   transmission (DTX) and comfort noise generation (CNG) by sending 
   Silence Descriptor (SID) frames during periods of non-active input 
   signal. The sampling frequency of the core codec is 16 kHz and the 
   codec operates on 20 ms frames. Note that the EV-VBR codec is also 
   capable of narrowband operation with audio input and/or output at 8 
   kHz sampling frequency. 

   While transmitting/receiving the core layer L1 is enough for 
   successful decoding of audio content, each of the enhancement layers 
   Ln provides an improvement to reconstructed audio quality. Thus, the 
   core layer ensures the basic communication while the enhancement 
   layers can be used to improve the perceptual quality. Furthermore, 
   enhancement layers are dependent on all the lower layers in a sense 
   that successful decoding of layer n requires also all the layers m 
   with m<n to be available. The sizes of the EV-VBR core codec layers 
   L1-L5 are summarized in Table 1 below. 

                          Table 1: EV-VBR layers 

        Layer    Bytes    Cumulative source bit-rate 
      -------------------------------------------- 
         L1        20             8 kbit/s 
         L2        10            12 kbit/s 
         L3        10            16 kbit/s 
         L4        20            24 kbit/s 
         L5        20            32 kbit/s 
    

   The EV-VBR codec includes also an encoding mode that compatible with 
   the Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband (AMR-WB) [RFC4867] codec. In this

Internet-Draft          RTP payload for EV-VBR            November 2007 
    

   AMR-WB interoperable mode layers L1, L2 are replaced by L1' 
   consisting of AMR-WB encoded data. Furthermore, together with L1' 
   modified L3' is used instead of L3. The usage of layers L4 and L5 is 
   not affected by transmitting AMR-WB data in the lower layers. Table 2 
   summarizes the AMR-WB interoperable modes. 

            Table 2: EV-VBR layers in AMR-WB interoperable mode 

        Layer    Bytes    Cumulative source bit-rate 
      -------------------------------------------- 
         L1'       32            12.8 kbit/s 
         L3'        8            16 kbit/s 
    

   Note that backwards compatibility with existing AMR-WB end-points can 
   be reached by using the AMR-WB RTP payload format [RFC4867]. 

   ITU-T SG16 is currently working on a set of extension layers in order 
   to provide a so-called super-wideband (SWB) audio and stereophonic 
   encoding extensions on top of the EV-VBR core codec. Further details 
   and the usage of these layers are T.B.D. 

   The main application of the EV-VBR codec is telephony. Other expected 
   applications include audio/video conferencing, audio streaming, etc. 

2.2. Benefits of layered design 

   The layered design enables simple scalability of the transmitted 
   stream simply by conveying a suitable number of layers. The number of 
   layers used in a session may be selected for example based on the 
   capacity of the transmission channel, current transmission 
   conditions, characteristics of the source signal or available 
   processing capacity.  

   Another obvious benefit of the layered codec design is the 
   possibility to exploit the scalability to support congestion control 
   by transmitting/dropping some of the (higher) enhancement layers in 
   order to alleviate congestion in the network. See more detailed 
   discussion on the congestion control in section 7. 

   Furthermore, the layered design also implicitly provides possibility 
   for unequal error detection/protection by employing different levels 
   of protection on core layer and enhancement layers.

2.3. Transmitting layered data 

   In principle there are two basic approaches to carry the data from a 
   layered encoder: 

   1. All the layers are carried in the same packet/payload within a 
      single RTP session. 

   2. The encoded data is divided over multiple RTP sessions, each 
      session carrying a subset of layers. 

   The first choice is the most efficient in terms of exploitation of 
   transmission bandwidth. Furthermore, using only one packet to carry 
   all encoded data layers of a frame requires less resources also from 
   the end-systems (and intermediate systems) since the number of 
   packets is kept at minimum and only single RTP packet stream needs to 
   be handled. However, this option requires any intermediate network 
   element performing the scaling operation to be fully media-aware 
   since removing encoded layers requires modification of the payload. 
   Furthermore, the intermediate network element needs to be within the 
   security context to enable the meaningful manipulation of the 
   payload, in case secure transport is employed. This might not be 
   feasible in all systems/scenarios, but some special-purpose devices 
   such as e.g. media gateways in cellular telephone systems may be able 
   to implement this kind of media-aware functionality. 

   The second alternative transmitting selected subsets of layers in 
   separate RTP sessions facilitates simple scalability in intermediate 
   network elements without the requirement of being fully media-aware. 
   On the other hand, this approach introduces separate packet header 
   overhead for each subset of layers. When the size of the encoded data 
   block per single layer is in the range of 10 to 20 bytes, the 
   packetisation may result in relatively high amount of protocol 
   overhead, which might be an expensive solution on bandwidth-limited 
   links. Another drawback of this approach is somewhat more complex 
   session setup and the additional complexity associated with handling 
   of several concurrent RTP sessions. However, this is a trade-off that 
   enables simple scalability also by intermediate network elements that 
   are not aware of the details of the transmitted media.  

2.4. Scaling scenarios & rate control 

   In principle there are three different ways to make use of the 
   layered design to control the bandwidth usage: 

   1. A sender decides to change number of layers it is transmitting 
   (for example due to congestion control constrains) 
 
 
Lakaniemi                Expires May 12, 2008                  [Page 5] 
    
Internet-Draft          RTP payload for EV-VBR            November 2007 
    

   2. A receiver or an intermediate network element instructs a sender 
      to change the number of layers it is transmitting 

   3. An intermediate network element passes forward only a subset of 
      layers it receives 

   The most appropriate mechanism depends on the application and the 
   employed network topology. For example point-to-point conversational 
   audio connection can easily introduce rate control by changing the 
   number of transmitted layers, while in centralized audio/video 
   conferencing scenario the conference server is a more appropriate 
   point to implement the rate control instead of transmitting end-
   point. Please refer to [topo] for extensive discussion on the 
   different topologies and their implications to the transmission. 

   However, the fundamental difference between these choices is that 
   while 1. does not necessarily need any feedback from the receiver(s), 
   2. and 3. require a signaling mechanism to support rate control 

3. EV-VBR RTP payload format 

   The basic EV-VBR source data unit is one layer of an encoded frame. 
   Since generally the term layer refers to time series of data 
   representing certain encoding layer, in this specification we use the 
   term Encoded Data Unit (EDU) to refer to a single layer of data from 
   single encoded frame. Thus, each EDU has a (conceptual) frame number 
   indicating its location in encoding/decoding order and a layer number 
   indicating the encoding layer the EDU represents. 

3.1. Payload Structure 

   The EV-VBR payload format consists of a payload header, followed by 
   one or more transport blocks (TB) forming the actual payload data. 

    +-----------------+----------+----------+- /// -+----------+ 
    | Payload header  |  TB(1)   |  TB(2)   |          TB(n)   | 
    +-----------------+----------+----------+- /// -+----------+ 
    

3.1.1. Payload Header 

   The payload header consists of 8-bit payload CRC checksum: 

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    |     CRC       | 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Internet-Draft          RTP payload for EV-VBR            November 2007 
    

   In the transmitting end the payload checksum is computed over the 
   primary transport block (see the definition section 3.1.2) of the 
   payload using the generator polynomial 

      C(z) = z^8 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + 1.  

   Subsequent transport blocks are prepared in such a way that the 
   payload checksum is valid for any integer number of contiguous 
   transport blocks starting from the beginning of the primary transport 
   block. 

   In the receiving end the payload CRC checksum can be used to verify 
   the correct reception of any contiguous subset of transport blocks 
   starting from the beginning of the primary transport block (see 
   section 3.3 for detailed description). 

3.1.2. EV-VBR transport blocks 

   The basic building block of the EV-VBR RTP payload data is an EV-VBR 
   transport block (TB). There are two types of transport blocks: 
   primary transport block and secondary transport block. 

   The structure of the primary transport block is depicted below. 

                      
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+----------------------------+ 
    |   L-ID    |NF | Encoded data               | 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+----------------------------+ 
    
   The structure of the secondary transport block is depicted below. 

                      
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7                              0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+----------------------------+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    |   L-ID    |NF | Encoded data               |     Tail      | 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+----------------------------+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   The layer ID (L-ID) and the NF fields form the transport block 
   header. The L-ID field is used to identify the layer structure of the 
   encoded data carried in this EV-VBR transport block, and the NF field 
   indicates the number of encoded frames with this layer structure 
   carried in the Encoded data part following the transport block 
   header. The Tail field of the secondary transport block carries a 
   modified 8-bit CRC checksum computed over the transport block, as 
   specified below.

   An EVR-VB RTP payload SHALL include exactly one primary transport 
   block and it MAY include one or more secondary transport blocks. The 
   data fields of the both transport block types are described below. 

   L-ID Identification (6 bits) of the encoded data carried in this 
        transport block. Table 3 below specifies the mapping between 
        the L-ID and the encoded data.

           21     AMR-WB SID 
           22-64  Reserved for stereo and SWB layers 
         
             Author's note: The current approach provides maximum 
             flexibility in terms of layer configuration. However, 
             limiting choices would be one way to leave more bits for 
             stereo & SWB layer configurations. 

             Author's note: One suggested way to make sure we do not 
             run out of L-ID values with the extension modes has been 
             to make the mapping between L-ID and layer configuration 
             it indicates dynamic (to be specified using SDP in session 
             set-up). While this would provide effective usage of L-ID 
             bits, it would require all elements processing the payload

             to be signaling-aware. A compromise solution would be to 
             provide static mapping for selected layer configurations 
             and leave 'more exotic' cases to be dynamically mapped on 
             session basis. The usage of this type of approach is FFS. 

   NF   Number of frames in this transport block (2 bits). The number 
        of frames is the value of NF incremented by one. I.e. value 
        NF=0 indicates that the transport block carries one frame, and 
        value NF=3 indicates four frames. If the sender wants to 
        encapsulate more than four frames per payload, several 
        transport blocks need to be used. 

   Encoded data 

        Encoded data consists of EDUs as specified by the values L-ID 
        and NF fields, arranged according to rules given in section 
        3.2. 

   Tail The 8-bit tail field of the secondary transport block carries a 
        bit field that is needed to modify the partial CRC checksum 
        over the payload data up to the end of this TB to match the 
        payload CRC field value carried in the payload header. 

        In the transmitter the Tail bits for a secondary TB(n) are 
        computed by first computing the CRC checksum CRC(n) over the 
        payload data from the beginning of the primary TB up to the end 
        of TB(n) using the generator polynomial C(z) given above. The 
        bits of the Tail field of TB(n) are set to zero value for the 
        CRC computation. The transmitted value of the Tail field in 
        TB(n) is obtained by bitwise XOR operation between the payload 
        CRC field value carried in the payload header and the CRC(n) 
        computed for TB(n). 

3.2. Handling the Encoded data 

   In order to provide unique mapping of EDUs to encoded frames, 
   following simple rules on sequence of frames and sequence of layers 
   need to be followed when creating a payload: 

   o  The frames within a payload MUST form a set of contiguous frames 
      in encoding/decoding order, i.e. if a payload carries frames n and 
      n+N, all frames between n and n+N in encoding/decoding order MUST 
      also be present in the payload. 

   o  The layers within a frame MUST form a contiguous set of layers, 
      i.e. if layers Lx and Ly of a frame are included in the payload, 
      all layers between Lx and Ly layers MUST also be present.

Internet-Draft          RTP payload for EV-VBR            November 2007 
    

   The EDUs within a transport block are arranged according to following 
   rules: 

   o  The EDUs within a transport block MUST be arranged in the 
      increasing order of layer number 

   o  The EDUs with the same layer number within a transport block MUST 
      be arranged in the encoding/decoding order 

   Explicit timing information for the transport blocks is not needed, 
   since the ordering of EDUs in the payload and their mapping to 
   transport blocks can be used to implicitly carry this information. 
   The following rules apply: 

   o  If the highest layer carried in transport block k is n, and the 
      lowest layer carried by transport block k+1 is n+1, the EDUs of 
      transport block k and k+1 belong to the same encoded frame. 
      Furthermore, if transport blocks k and k+1 carry EDUs belonging to 
      the same encoded frame(s), these transport blocks MUST include the 
      same number of EDUs. 

   o  If the highest layer carried in transport block k is n, and the 
      lowest layer carried by transport block k+1 is smaller than or 
      equal to n, the EDUs of transport block k and k+1 belong to the 
      two separate encoded frames, which are contiguous in 
      encoding/decoding order. 

   o  Multiple copies of an EDU MUST NOT be included in the payload. 

   A set of EDUs can be allocated to transport blocks in several ways. 
   For example each EDU can be encapsulated in its own transport block, 
   all EDUs can be carried in single transport block, EDUs belonging to 
   the same encoded frame can be encapsulated in dedicated transport 
   block, or EDUs representing the same layer can be carried in their 
   own transport blocks. Three examples on this with two frames with 
   layers L1-L3 are given below. The first example illustrates the case 
   using only single transport block for the whole payload, while the 
   second payload example introduces separate transport blocks for each 
   of the EDUs. The third example shows an approach where all layers are 
   carried in dedicated transport blocks. The notation Fx-Ly is used to 
   denote layer y of frame x. 

   Example 1: All EDUs in a single transport block

     | L-ID=10 |NF=2 | F1-L3 | F2-L3 | 
     +---------+-----+-------+-------+ 
      
   While the first example carrying data from all layers in the same 
   transport block obviously consumes less bandwidth, the second and 
   third examples using dedicated transport blocks for each layer 
   provide simple scaling possibility: while in the first case the 
   removal of e.g. layer L3 (from each frame in the payload) would 
   require changing the value of the L-ID in addition to removing the 
   corresponding EDU(s), in the second and third options it is enough to 
   just remove all transport blocks carrying L3 data and the remaining 
   part of the payload can be left untouched. 

3.3. CRC verification 

   In the receiving end the CRC verification is made in such a way that 
   the CRC computation is started from the beginning of the primary TB, 
   i.e. from the MSB of the first octet of the TB(1), and the 
   computation is continued until the end of the payload data or until 
   an erroneous TB is encountered. At the end of each TB a check is 
   performed: if the CRC value at the end of TB(n) matches the payload 
   CRC value received in the payload header, the verification is 
   successful and the data up TB(n) is valid. If the CRC value at the 
   end of TB(n) does not match the payload CRC value received in the 
   payload header, there is an error in the TB(n) and it MUST be 
   discarded as corrupted. Furthermore, if the verification indicates 
   corrupted TB(n), all subsequent transport blocks TB(m) with m>n MUST 
   also be discarded.

3.4. EV-VBR session 

   An EV-VBR session consists of one or several RTP sessions carrying 
   encoded EV-VBR data according the payload format specified in section 
   3.2. 

3.5. RTP Header usage 

   This section specifies the usage of some fields of the RTP header 
   (specified in section 5 of [RFC3550]) with the EV-VBR RTP payload 
   format. 

   In case the EV-VBR session consists multiple RTP sessions, the RTP 
   sessions are further separated by using different payload type (PT) 
   values for each of the RTP streams. In case of all layers carried 
   within a single RTP session there is need for only one PT. Note that 
   the assignment of the PT number(s) for this payload format are 
   outside the scope of this document. It is expected that the RTP 
   profile under which this payload is used will either assign PT 
   number(s) for this encoding or specify the PT number(s) to be 
   dynamically assigned. 

   Each of the RTP sessions involved in the EV-VBR session SHALL use the 
   same SSRC value. 

   The RTP timestamp corresponds to the sampling instant of the first 
   encoded sample of the earliest frame in the payload. The timestamp 
   clock frequency is 32 kHz. All RTP streams involved in the session 
   SHALL use the same timestamp space.  

   The marker bit (M) of each of the RTP streams of the session SHALL be 
   set to value 1 if the payload carries an EDU belonging to the first 
   speech frame after an inactive period, i.e. an EDU from the first 
   speech frame of a talkspurt. For all other packets the marker bit is 
   set to value 0. 

4. Codec bit-rate control 

   The media parameters defined in section 5.1 can be used to 
   negotiate/declare the employed layer configuration by defining the 
   lowest and highest layer numbers for each employed RTP session. The 
   highest layer defined for the session specifies the initial maximum 
   bandwidth, which cannot be changed without a session re-negotiation 
   or codec bit-rate control signaling during the session. 

   The codec bit-rate control during a session can be performed by 
   instructing the transmitter in the far-end to change the layer

   configuration it is encoding/sending. In case of an EV-VBR session 
   consisting of single RTP session this will change the size of the 
   inbound payloads, whereas in case of an EV-VBR session employing 
   multiple RTP sessions either the number of streams will change and/or 
   the configuration of the streams carrying the highest layers will 
   change. 

   The codec bit-rate control request to the far-end transmitter is sent 
   by using an application-defined RTCP packet, as specified below.

   The V, P, PT, length and SSRC/CSRC fields are used as specified in 
   section 6.7 of [RFC3550]. The rest of the fields are used as defined 
   below. 

   subtype 

        SHALL be set to zero by the sender and ignored by the receiver. 

   name 

        SHALL be set to value "EV-VBR configuration". 

   padding 

        SHALL be set to zero by the sender and ignored by the receiver. 

   SWB 

        Indicates the super-wideband configuration the sender of this 
        packet would like to receive. Value 0 indicates that the sender 
        of this packet would not like to receive the super-wideband 
        option. Other values are T.B.D. 

   Stereo

Internet-Draft          RTP payload for EV-VBR            November 2007 
    

        Indicates the stereo configuration the sender of this packet 
        would like to receive. Value 0 indicates that the sender of 
        this packet would not like to receive the stereo option. Other 
        values are T.B.D. 

   ML 

        Indicates the number of the highest layer of the core codec the 
        sender of this packet wishes to receive. The valid values of ML 
        are in the range from 1 to 5. Other values are reserved for 
        future use. The receiver MUST ignore invalid values. 

   A transmitter that has received a codec bit-rate control request 
   SHOULD start using the requested mode configuration as soon as 
   possible. The transmitter MAY transmit fewer layers than requested. 

   The codec bit-rate control request is valid until the next request is 
   received. Thus, a transmitter that has received a codec bit-rate 
   control request message SHOULD follow the most recent request until a 
   new request is received. 

   This APP packet can be included in a compound RTCP packet or it can 
   be send using the non-compound RTCP approach (FFS). 

      Author's note: One alternative method would be to use in-band 
      signaling, e.g. by adding one byte to the payload header 
      including the similar information as defined for the application-
      dependent part of the APP packet specified above. However, 
      although effective, this would be a non-desirable (i.e. "non-
      RTP") way to do it. 

      Author's note: Further alternatives include exploitation of 
      existing codec bit-rate control mechanisms. One possibility would 
      be to use the TIMBR message defined as part of the Codec Control 
      Messages (CCM) [ccm] for codec bit-rate control. Another 
      possibility could be to specify a new dedicated feedback message 
      within Audio/Video Profile with Feedback (AVPF) [RFC4585] 
      framework. However, in both this scenarios the codec bit-rate 
      control would be available only when using the AVPF profile. 

5. Payload Format Parameters 

   This section defines the parameters that may be used to configure 
   optional features in the EV-VBR RTP transmission.

   registration for the EV-VBR codec.  Mapping of the parameters into

   the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] is also provided for 
   those applications that use SDP.  In control protocols that do not 
   use MIME or SDP, the media type parameters must be mapped to the 
   appropriate format used with that control protocol. 

5.1. Media Type Registration 

   This registration is done using the template defined in RFC 4288 
   [RFC4288] and following RFC 4855 [RFC4855]. 

   Type name:  audio 

   Subtype name:  EV-VBR 

   Required parameters:  none 

   Optional parameters: 

      layers:    The numbers of the layers (in range from 1 to 5, 
                 denoting layers from L1 to L5, respectively) 
                 transmitted in this session, expressed as comma-
                 separated list of layer numbers. If the parameter is 
                 present, at least layer L1 MUST be included in the 
                 list of layers (at least?) in one of the RTP sessions 
                 included in the EV-VBR session. If the parameter is 
                 not present, all layers up to layer L5 MAY be used in 
                 the session. 

      ptime:     the recommended length of time (in milliseconds) 
                 represented by the media in a packet.  See Section 6 
                 of [RFC4566]. 

      maxptime:  the maximum length of time (in milliseconds) that can 
                 be encapsulated in a packet.  See Section 6 of 
                 [RFC4566] 

      Author's note: Some further study needed to see if separate 
      parameters for sending and receiving capabilities/preferences are 
      needed -- especially for upcoming stereo and SWB options. 

      Author's note: The support for upcoming SWB and stereo options 
      needs to be taken into account. Basically we can either 1) extend 
      the parameter "layers" to cover also this aspect, or 2) define 
      separate parameter(s) for these new options when more details on 
      the stereo/SWB support are available.

5.2. Mapping to SDP Parameters 

   The information carried in the media type specification has a 
   specific mapping to fields of the SDP [RFC4566], which is commonly 
   used to describe RTP sessions.  When SDP is used to specify sessions 
   employing the EV-VBR codec, the mapping is as follows: 

   o  The media type ("audio") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name. 



 
 
Lakaniemi                Expires May 12, 2008                 [Page 16] 
    
Internet-Draft          RTP payload for EV-VBR            November 2007 
    

   o  The media subtype ("EV-VBR") goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as the 
      encoding name.  The RTP clock rate in "a=rtpmap" MUST be 32000 for 
      EV-VBR. 

      Author's note: The current choice for the RTP clock rate is a 
      'placeholder'. The clock rate needs to be set according to SWB 
      sampling rate, which is still T.B.D. Since the core codec employs 
      16000 Hz sampling rate, an integer multiple of 16000 Hz seems a 
      preferable choice.  

   o  The parameters "ptime" and "maxptime" go in the SDP "a=ptime" and 
      "a=maxptime" attributes, respectively. 

   o  Any remaining parameters go in the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute by 
      copying them directly from the media type string as a semicolon 
      separated list of parameter=value pairs. 

5.3. Offer/answer considerations 

   The following considerations apply when using the SDP offer/answer 
   [RFC3264] mechanism to negotiate the EV-VBR transport. The parameter 
   "layers" MAY be used to indicate the layer configuration for the each 
   RTP session belonging to current EV-VBR session an end-point making 
   the offer is ready to transmit and wishes to receive. 

   o  In case the EV-VBR session consists of a single RTP session, it is 
      RECOMMENDED not to impose any layer restrictions for the session 
      but to use the rate control functionality to set possible 
      restrictions on usage of the higher/st layers. If the offer 
      includes a layer configuration parameter, the answer MAY use 
      different configuration, but the highest layer in the answer MUST 
      NOT be higher than the highest layer of the offered configuration. 

      Author's note: Support for answer modifying the layer 
      configuration is FFS. 

   In case the EV-VBR session consists of multiple RTP sessions, the 
   answer MUST use the layer configurations provided in the offer for 
   the sessions it accepts.  

5.4. Declarative usage of SDP 

   In declarative usage, such as SDP in RTSP [RFC2326] or SAP [RFC2974], 
   the parameter "layers" SHALL be interpreted to provide a set of 
   layers that the sender may use in the session.

5.5. SDP examples 

   Some example SDP session descriptions utilizing EV-VBR encodings are 
   provided below. 

   The first example illustrates the simple case where the EV-VBR 
   session employing a single RTP session and the AVPF profile is 
   offered, and the answer accepts the offer without any changes. 

   Offer: 

     m=audio 49120 RTP/AVPF 97 
     a=rtpmap:97 EV-VBR/32000/1 
      
   Answer: 

     m=audio 49120 RTP/AVPF 97 
     a=rtpmap:97 EV-VBR/32000/1 
      
   The second example shows a bit more complex case where the EV-VBR 
   session using a single RTP session and the AVPF profile is offered 
   with restriction to send/receive only with layers L1 and L2. The 
   answer indicates that the other end-point is happy to receive (and 
   send) layers up to L5. 

   Offer: 

     m=audio 49120 RTP/AVPF 97 
     a=rtpmap:97 EV-VBR/32000/1 
     a=fmtp:97 layers=1,2 
      
   Answer: 

     m=audio 49120 RTP/AVPF 97 
     a=rtpmap:97 EV-VBR/32000/1 
     a=fmtp:97 layers=1,2,3,4,5 
      
   The third example shows an EV-VBR session using multiple RTP sessions 
   with the AVPF profile. The answerer wishes to use only layers up to 
   L3.

     a=mid=2 
     a=depend:lay 1 
      
   Note that the dependency signaling according to [smd-sdp] is used in 
   the third example above to indicate the relationship between the 
   layers distributed into separate RTP sessions. 

6. Security Considerations 

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification 
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP 
   specification [RFC3550], and in any appropriate RTP profile (for 
   example [RFC3551] or [RFC4585]).  This implies that confidentiality 
   of the media streams is achieved by encryption; for example, through 
   the application of SRTP [RFC3711].  Because the data compression used 
   with this payload format is applied end-to-end, any encryption needs 
   to be performed after compression. 

   A potential denial-of-service threat exists for data encodings using 
   compression techniques that have non-uniform receiver-end

   computational load.  The attacker can inject pathological datagrams 
   into the stream that will increase the processing load of the decoder 
   and may cause the receiver to be overloaded. For example inserting 
   additional EDUs representing the higher enhancement layers on top of 
   the ones actually transmitted may increase the decoder load. However, 
   the EV-VBR codec is not particularly vulnerable to such an attack, 
   since the majority of the computational load in an EV-VBR session is 
   associated to the encoder.  Another form of possible attach might be 
   forging of codec bit-rate control messages, which may result in 
   encoder operating employing higher number of enhancement layers than 
   originally intended and thereby requiring larger amount of 
   computation resources. Therefore, the usage of data origin 
   authentication and data integrity protection of at least the RTP 
   packet is RECOMMENDED; for example, with SRTP [RFC3711]. 

   Note that the appropriate mechanism to ensure confidentiality and 
   integrity of RTP packets and their payloads is very dependent on the 
   application and on the transport and signaling protocols employed. 
   Thus, although SRTP is given as an example above, other possible 
   choices exist. 

   Note that end-to-end security with either authentication, integrity 
   or confidentiality protection will prevent a network element not 
   within the security context from performing media-aware operations 
   other than discarding complete packets.  To allow any (media-aware) 
   intermediate network element to perform its operations, it is 
   required to be a trusted entity which is included in the security 
   context establishment. 

7. Congestion control 

   As scalable codec EV-VBR implicitly provides means for congestion 
   control by providing a possibility for 'thinning' the bitstream. The 
   RTP payload format according to this specification provides several 
   different means for reducing the EV-VBR session bandwidth. The most 
   appropriate mechanism (in terms of impact to the user experience) 
   depends on the employed payload structure and also on the employed 
   session configuration (single RTP session or multiple RTP sessions). 
   The following means (in no particular order) can be used to assist 
   congestion control procedures -- either by the sender or by the 
   intermediate node. 

   o  The transport blocks carrying the EDUs representing the highest 
      layers within the payload may be dropped. 

   o  The payloads carrying the EDUs representing the highest layers in 
      an EV-VBR session are dropped.

8. IANA Considerations 

   IANA is kindly requested to register a media type for the EV-VBR 
   codec for RTP transport, as specified in section 5.1 of this 
   document.

APPENDIX A: Payload examples 

   The EV-VBR payload structure enables flexible transport either by 
   carrying all layers in the same payload or separating the layers into 
   separate payloads. The following subsections illustrate different 
   possibilities for transport by simple examples. Note that examples do 
   not show the full payload structure to keep the illustration simple.  

A.1. Simple payload examples 

A.1.1. All the layers in the same payload 

   The illustration below shows layers L1-L3 from two encoded frames 
   encapsulated into separate payloads using single transport block. 

    +-------+--------+-----+------+------+------+ 
    | RTP1  | L-ID=3 |NF=1 |F1-L1 |F1-L2 |F1-L3 |     
    +-------+--------+-----+------+------+------+ 
    
    +-------+--------+-----+------+------+------+ 
    | RTP2  | L-ID=3 |NF=1 |F2-L1 |F2-L2 |F3-L3 | 
    +-------+--------+-----+------+------+------+ 
    

   In case the same layers from two input frames are encapsulated into 
   one payload using single transport block, the structure is as shown 
   below. 

    +-------+--------+-----+------+------+------+------+------+------+ 
    | RTP1  | L-ID=3 |NF=2 |F1-L1 |F2-L1 |F1-L2 |F2-L2 |F3-L3 |F2-L3 | 
    +-------+--------+-----+------+------+------+------+------+------+ 
    

   The third example illustrates the case where the layers L1-L3 from 
   two input frames are encapsulated into one payload using two separate 
   transport blocks, the first one carrying L1 and the other one 
   containing L2 and L3.

    +-------+--------+-----+------+------+ 
    | RTP1  | L-ID=1 |NF=2 |F1-L1 |F2-L1 | 
    +-------+--------+-----+------+------+------+------+ 
            | L-ID=7 |NF=2 |F1-L2 |F2-L2 |F3-L3 |F2-L3 | 
            +--------+-----+------+------+------+------+ 
    
A.1.2. Layers in separate RTP streams 

   In this case the data for each layer is transmitted in its own 
   payload. 

   In the first example each transport block including a single EDU is 
   carried in its own RTP payload. 

    +-------+--------+-----+-----+    +-------+--------+-----+-----+ 
    | RTP1a | L-ID=1 |NF=1 |F1-L1|    | RTP1b | L-ID=6 |NF=1 |F1-L2| 
    +-------+--------+-----+-----+    +-------+--------+-----+-----+ 
    
    +-------+--------+-----+-----+    +-------+--------+-----+-----+ 
    | RTP1c |L-ID=10 |NF=1 |F1-L3|    | RTP2a | L-ID=1 |NF=1 |F2-L1| 
    +-------+--------+-----+-----+    +-------+--------+-----+-----+ 
      
    +-------+--------+-----+-----+    +-------+--------+-----+-----+ 
    | RTP2b | L-ID=6 |NF=1 |F2-L2|    | RTP2c |L-ID=10 |NF=1 |F2-L3| 
    +-------+--------+-----+-----+    +-------+--------+-----+-----+ 
    

   If the payloads carry data from two consecutive input frames, the 
   same encoded data as in the previous example is arranged as follows.

   frames per packet) for selected subsets of layers. In these examples 
   all core codec layers L1-L5 are shown.

   previous frame) as redundant data is shown below. Each payload 
   carries one primary (i.e. new) frame and one redundant frame.
