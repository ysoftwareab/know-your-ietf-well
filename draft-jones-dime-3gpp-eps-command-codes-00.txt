1.  Introduction

   The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is defining the
   Evolved Packet System (EPS) as part of their Release 8 architecture.
   As part of this architecture, the interfaces based on the Diameter
   protocol [RFC3588] required the definition of two new Diameter
   applications: the 3GPP S6a application (vendor-specific application
   id: 1677251) and 3GPP S13 application (vendor-specific application
   id: 1677252), both defined under the 3GPP vendor-id "10415".  These
   Diameter applications are described in [TS29.272].  This document
   defines the assigned values of the command codes used in these
   applications.


2.  Terminology

   The base Diameter specification (Section 1.4 of [RFC3588]) defines
   most of the terminology used in this document.  Additionally, the
   terms and acronyms defined in [TS29.272] are used in this document.


3.  Command Codes

   The 3GPP S6a application described in [TS29.272] requires the
   allocation of command code values for the following command pairs:

   o  Update-Location-Request/Answer (ULR/ULA)

   o  Cancel-Location-Request/Answer (CLR/CLA)

   o  Authentication-Information-Request/ Answer (AIR/AIA)

   o  Insert-Subscriber-Data-Request/Answer (IDR/IDA)

   o  Delete-Subscriber-Data-Request/Answer (DSR/DSA)

   o  Purge-UE-Request/Answer (PUR/PUA)

   o  Reset-Request/Answer (RSR/RSA)

   o  Notify-Request/Answer (NOR/NOA)

   The 3GPP S13 application described in [TS29.272] requires the
   allocation of a command code value for the following command pair:

   o  ME-Identity-Check-Request/Answer (ECR/ECA)

4.  IANA Considerations

   This section provides guidance to the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA) regarding registration of values related to the
   Diameter protocol, in accordance with BCP 26 [RFC5226].

   This document defines values in the namespace that has been defined
   in the Diameter Base [RFC3588].  Section 11 of [RFC3588] (IANA
   Considerations) details the assignment criteria.  Values assigned in
   this document, or by future IANA action, must be coordinated within
   this shared namespace.

4.1.  Command Codes

   IANA is requested to allocate the following command code values:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Code Command Name                        Abbreviation Defined in     |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| tbd  Update-Location-Request/Answer      ULR/ULA      3GPP TS 29.272 |
| tbd  Cancel-Location-Request/Answer      CLR/CLA      3GPP TS 29.272 |
| tbd  Authentication-Information-Request/ AIR/AIA      3GPP TS 29.272 |
|      Answer                                                          |
| tbd  Insert-Subscriber-Data-Request/     IDR/IDA      3GPP TS 29.272 |
|      Answer                                                          |
| tbd  Delete-Subscriber-Data-Request/     DSR/DSA      3GPP TS 29.272 |
|      Answer                                                          |
| tbd  Purge-UE-Request/Answer             PUR/PUA      3GPP TS 29.272 |
| tbd  Reset-Request/Answer                RSR/RSA      3GPP TS 29.272 |
| tbd  Notify-Request/Answer               NOR/NOA      3GPP TS 29.272 |
| tbd  ME-Identity-Check-Request/Answer    ECR/ECA      3GPP TS 29.272 |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+


5.  Security Considerations

   This document describes command codes used in applications which
   build on top of the Diameter base protocol and the same security
   considerations described in [RFC3588] are applicable to this
   document.  No further extensions are required beyond the security
   mechanisms offered by [RFC3588].


6.  Acknowledgements

   We would like to thank the 3GPP CT4 delegates, Victor Fajardo and
   Glen Zorn for their review and comments.  We would also like to thank
   Dan Romascanu for volunteering to be AD sponsor and Hannes Tschofenig
