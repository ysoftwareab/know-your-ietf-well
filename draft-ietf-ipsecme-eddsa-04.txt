1.  Introduction

   The Internet Key Exchange protocol [RFC7296] can use arbitrary
   signature algorithms as described in [RFC7427].  The latter RFC
   defines the SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS notification where each side of
   the IKE negotiation lists its supported hash algorithms.  This
   assumes that all signature schemes involve a hashing phase followed
   by a signature phase.  This made sense because most signature
   algorithms either cannot sign messages bigger than their key or
   truncate messages bigger than their key.

   EdDSA ([RFC8032]) defines signature methods that do not require pre-
   hashing of the message.  Unlike other methods, these accept
   arbitrary-sized messages, so no pre-hashing is required.  These
   methods are called Ed25519 and Ed448, which respectively use the
   Edwards 25519 and the Edwards 448 ("Goldilocks") curves.  Although
   that document also defines pre-hashed versions of these algorithm,
   those versions are not recommended for protocols where the entire to-
   be-signed message is available at once.  See section 8.5 or RFC 8032
   for that recommendation.

   EdDSA defines the binary format of the signatures that should be used
   in the "Signature Value" field of the Authentication Data Format in
   section 3.  The CURDLE PKIX document ([I.D-curdle-pkix]) defines the
   object identifiers (OIDs) for these signature methods.  For
   convenience, these OIDs are repeated in Appendix A.

   In order to signal within IKE that no hashing needs to be done, we
   define a new value in the SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS notification, one
   that indicates that no hashing is performed.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  The "Identity" Hash Identifier

   This document defines a new value called "Identity" (value is 5) in
   the hash algorithm registry for use in the SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS
   notification.  Inserting this new value into the notification
   indicates that the receiver supports at least one signature algorithm
   that accepts arbitrary-sized messages such as Ed25519 and Ed448.

   Ed25519 and Ed448 are only defined with the Identity hash, and MUST
   NOT be sent to a receiver that has not indicated support for the
   "Identity" hash.

   The pre-hashed versions of Ed25519 and Ed448 (Ed25519ph and Ed448ph
   respectively) MUST NOT be used in IKE.

3.  Security Considerations

   The new "Identity" value is needed only for signature algorithms that
   accept an arbitrary-sized input.  It MUST NOT be used if none of the
   supported and configured algorithms have this property.  On the other
   hand there is no good reason to pre-hash the inputs where the
   signature algorithm has that property.  For this reason
   implementations MUST have the "Identity" value in the
   SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS notification when EdDSA is supported and
   configured.  Implementations SHOULD NOT have other hash algorithms in
   the notification if all supported and configured signature algorithms
   have this property.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned the value 5 for the algorithm with the name
   "Identity" in the "IKEv2 Hash Algorithms" registry with this draft as
   reference.

   Upon publication of this document IANA is requested to update the
   entry with this document as reference.
