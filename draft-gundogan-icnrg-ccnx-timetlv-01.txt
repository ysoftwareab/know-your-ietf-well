  An Alternative Delta Time encoding for CCNx using Interval Time from
                                RFC5497
                draft-gundogan-icnrg-ccnx-timetlv-01

Abstract

   CCNx utilizes Delta Time for a number of functions.  When using CCNx
   in environments with constrained nodes and/or bandwidth constrained
   networks, it is valuable to have a compressed representation of delta
   time.  In order to do so, either accuracy or dynamic range has to be
   sacrificed.  Since the current uses of delta time do not require both
   simultaneously, one can consider a logarithmic encoding such as that
   specified in RFC5497.  This document updates _CCNx messages in TLV
   Format_ (RFC8609) to specify this alternative encoding.

1.  Introduction

   CCNx utilizes Time values for a number of functions.  Some of these
   are expressed as absolute time, others as delta time.  When using
   CCNx in environments with constrained nodes and/or bandwidth
   constrained networks, it is valuable to have a compact representation
   of time values.  For example [I-D.irtf-icnrg-icnlowpan] specifies a
   compression scheme useful over IEEE 802.15.4 networks.  However, any
   compact time representation has to sacrifice either accuracy or
   dynamic range or both.  For some time uses this is relatively
   straightforward to achieve, for other uses, it is not.  This document
   discusses the various cases, and proposes a compact encoding that is
   easily accommodated for delta times, and a more complicated method
   that can be considered for some uses of absolute time.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Usage of Time values CCNx

3.1.  Relative Time usage in CCNx

   CCNx, as currently specified in [RFC8569], utilizes delta time for
   only the lifetime of an Interest message (sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.4.2,
   10.3).  It is a hop-by-hop header value, and is currently encoded via
   the T_INTLIFE TLV as a 64-bit integer ([RFC8609] section 3.4.1).
   While formally an optional TLV, in all but some corner cases every
   Interest Message is expected to carry the Interest Lifetime TLV, and
   hence having compact encoding is particularly valuable for keeping
   Interest messages short.

   Since the current uses of delta time do not require both accuracy and
   dynamic range simultaneously, one can consider a logarithmic encoding
   such as that specified in [RFC5497] and outlined in Section 4.  This
   document updates CCNx messages in TLV Format ([RFC8609]) to permit
   this alternative encoding for selected Time values.  See Section 6
   for the specific actions needed to register this alternative compact
   representation of Interest Lifetime.

3.2.  Absolute Time usage in CCNx

   CCNx, as currently specified in [RFC8569], utilizes absolute time for
   various important functions.  Each of these absolute time usages
   poses a different challenge for a compact representation.  These are
   discussed in the following subsections.

3.2.1.  Signature Time

   _Signature Time_ is the time the signature of a content object was
   generated (sections 8.2-8.4 [RFC8569]).  This is a content message
   TLV and represents an absolute timestamp in milliseconds since the
   UTC epoch (i.e.  An NTP timestamp).  It is currently encoded via the
   T_SIGTIME TLV as a 64-bit unsigned integer (see section 3.6.4.1.4.5
   [RFC8609]).

   Given that a signature time could be essentially at any time in the
   past, and is included in the hash securing the content object, it
   seems there is no practical way to define an alternative compact
   encoding that preserves its semantics and security properties; hence
   we don't consider it further as a candidate.

Internet-Draft              TimeTLV for CCNx                  March 2020


3.2.2.  Expiry Time

   _Expiry Time_ indicates the expiry time of a content object (section
   4 [RFC8569]).  This is a content message TLV (covered by the hash and
   signature of the content object) and represents an absolute timestamp
   in milliseconds since the UTC epoch (i.e.  An NTP timestamp).  It is
   currently encoded via the T_EXPIRY TLV as a 64-bit unsigned integer
   (see section 3.6.2.2.2 [RFC8609]).

   Expiry time could be in the past, or in the future, potentially by a
   large delta, and is included in the hash securing the content object.
   Therefore, it seems there is no practical way to define an
   alternative compact encoding that preserves its semantics and
   security properties; hence we don't consider it further as a
   candidate.

3.2.3.  Recommended Cache Time

   _Recommended Cache Time_ (RCT) for a content object (see section 4
   [RFC8569]) is a hop-by-hop header stating the expiration time for a
   cached content object in milliseconds since the UTC epoch (i.e.  An
   NTP timestamp).  It is currently encoded via the T_CACHETIME TLV as a
   64-bit unsigned integer (see section 3.4.2 [RFC8609]).

   Recommended cache time could be far in the future, but cannot be in
   the past and is likely to be a reasonably short offset from the
   current time.  Therefore, this document allows the recommended cache
   time to be interpreted as a relative time value rather than an
   absolute time, since the semantics associated with an absolute time
   value do not seem to be critical to the utility of this value.  This
   document therefore updates the recommended cache time with the
   following rule set:

   o  Use absolute time as per [RFC8609]

   o  Use relative time, if the compact time representation is used (see
      Section 4 and Section 5)

4.  A Compact Time Representation with Logarithmic Range

   This document defines a compact time representation with logarithmic
   range support that is inspired by [RFC5497] and [IEEE.754.2019].
   Compact time-codes are one octet wide and represent time-values that
   range from milliseconds to years.  Figure 1 depicts the logarithmic
   nature of this time representation.

    milliseconds                                                  years

      Figure 1: A logarithmic range representation allows for higher
    precision in the smaller time ranges and still supports large time
                                  deltas.

   Time-codes encode an exponent and a mantissa as illustrated in
   Figure 2.  In contrast to the representation in [IEEE.754.2019],
   time-codes only encode positive numbers and hence do not include an
   extra sign bit.

                     <---      one octet wide     --->
                     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
                     |  exponent (e) |  mantissa (m) |
                     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

       Figure 2: A time-code with exponent and mantissa to encode a
                  logarithmic range time representation.

   The base unit for time values are seconds.  A time-value is
   calculated using the following formula, where (e) represents the
   exponent, (m) the mantissa, (m_max) the maximum mantissa value, and
   (b) the bias.

   Subnormal (e == 0):  (0 + m/m_max) * 2^(1+b)

   Normalized (e > 0):  (1 + m/m_max) * 2^(e+b)

   The subnormal form is only applied when the exponent is zero.  This
   form provides a gradual underflow for the gap between the smallest
   normalized number and zero.  The normalized form is applied for all
   values with an exponent greater than zero.

   This document allocates "5" bits for the exponent and "3" bits for
   the mantissa.  Therefore, exponents have the range [0,31] and
   mantissae have the range [0,7].  This document further applies a bias
   of "-5".  The following properties result from this configuration:

   o  Minimum subnormal number: 0 seconds

   o  Maximum subnormal number: ~0.054688 seconds

   o  Minimum normalized number: ~0.062500 seconds

   o  Maximum normalized numbers: [~3.46, ~3.72, ~3.99] years

   Eight time values exist in the subnormal range [0,~0.054688s] with a
   step size of ~0.007813s between each time value.  In addition, this
   configuration also encodes the following convenient numbers in
   seconds: [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, ...].

5.  Protocol Integration of the Compact Time Representation in CCNx
    Messages

   A straightforward way to accommodate the compact time approach as an
   alternative encoding is to simply allow a 1-byte length as an
   alternative to the 8-byte length while retaining the existing TLV
   Registry entries.  This approach has backward compatibility problems,
   but may still be considered for the following reasons:

   o  Both CCNx RFCs are experimental and not Standards Track, hence
      expectations for forward and backward compatibility are not as
      stringent.  "Flag day" upgrades of deployed CCNx networks, while
      inconvenient, are still feasible.

   o  The major use case for these compressed encodings are smaller-
      scale IoT and/or sensor networks where the population of
      consumers, producers, and forwarders is reasonably small.

   o  Since the current TLVs have hop-by-hop semantics, they are not
      covered by any signed hash and hence may be freely re-encoded by
      any forwarder.  That means a forwarder supporting the new encoding
      can translate freely between the two encodings.

   o  The alternative of assigning new TLV registry values does not
      substantially mitigate the interoperability problems anyway.

   The following lists alternative approaches of integrating the compact
   time representation for time offsets in CCNx messages.  A further
   analysis, discussion, and decision on the best suited approach will
   be added as the document progresses.

   1.  Relative time TLVs (e.g., T_INTLIFETIME) include nested TLVs to
       hint at the used encoding.  This approach is the least intrusive
       integration, but adds a TLV overhead that negates the benefits of
       the compact time representation.

   2.  A new TLV type for T_INTLIFETIME with a compact time
       representation (T_INTLIFETIME_COMPACT) is defined.  The packet
       header grammar from [RFC8609] is updated to allow for
       T_INTLIFETIME_COMPACT at the same level of the currently defined
       T_INTLIFETIME with an exclusive or.

6.  IANA Considerations

   Based on the approach of integration, certain TLV registries from
   [RFC8609] need to be updated.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document makes no semantic changes to RFC8965, nor to any of the
   security properties of the message encodings of RFC8609, and hence
   has the same security considerations as those two existing documents.
