1.  Introduction

   This document defines an extension to the Atom Syndication Format
   that can be used to describe the explicit rights that have been
   granted to consumers of an Atom feed or entry.

1.1.  Experimental Status

   Describing licenses using the mechanisms defined in this
   specification is currently considered to be largely experimental.
   While it is a common practice for feed publishers to associate
   licenses with syndicated content, there are still very few feed
   consumers that utilize such metadata and the effectiveness of doing
   so is still largely unknown.  As it is not yet certain how these
   mechanisms will be used, implementations and feedback are encouraged.

1.2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].

1.3.  Terminology

   The term "link relation" refers to the value of the Atom link
   elements "rel" attribute as defined in section 4.2.7.2 of [RFC4287].

   The term "license" refers to a potentially machine-readable
   description of explicit rights, and associated obligations, that have
   been granted to consumers of an Atom feed or entry.


2.  The "license" link relation

   The "license" link relation can be used to associate licenses with a
   feed or entry.

   Feed and entry elements MAY contain any number of "license" link
   relations but MUST NOT contain more than one with the same
   combination of href and type attribute values.  The IRI specified by
   the link's 'href' attribute SHOULD be dereferenceable to return a
   representation of the license.  The license representation MAY be
   machine readable.

   Feeds and entries can be dual-licensed by including multiple
   "license" link relations specifying different href attribute values.
   If multiple license link relations are specified, each SHOULD contain
   a title attribute specifying a human-readable label for the license.

2.1.  Unspecified License Links

   A publisher can use an "unspecified license link" (a "license" link
   relation with an href attribute value equal to
   "http://purl.org/atompub/license#unspecified") to indicate that a
   feed or license has not been explicitly linked to a license
   description.

   A feed or entry containing an unspecified license link MUST NOT
   contain any other license link relations.

2.2.  Example

     <feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">
       <id>http://www.example.com/myfeed</id>
       <title>My Example Feed</title>
       <updated>2005-07-28T12:00:00Z</updated>
       <link href="http://www.example.com/myfeed" />
       <link rel="license" type="application/rdf+xml"
         href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/rdf" />
       <rights>
         Copyright (c) 2005. Some rights reserved. This feed
         is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribute-NonCommercial
         Use License. It contains material originally published by
         Jane Smith at http://www.example.com/entries/1 under the
         Creative Commons Attribute License.

           href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/" />
       </entry>
     </feed>

2.3.  Inherited Licenses

   The license on a feed MAY be inherited by entries.  Generally, a more
   specific license overrides the less specific license.  More
   specifically, if an entry has any license link relations at all,
   including the "undefined" license, it does not inherit the license of
   the feed.  If an entry has no license link relations, it does inherit
   the license of its parent feed(s).  Since an entry may appear in

   multiple feeds, it may inherit multiple licenses.  This is equivalent
   to stating multiple licenses on the entry itself.

   The license on an entry MAY be inherited by media resources
   associated with the entry.  Some media types have ways of including
   license information, which always overrides the entry's licensing.

   Thus, an agent searching to find entries that fall under a specific
   license (e.g. search for entries containing pictures and the word
   "knitting" where the entry is under any Creative Commons license)
   MUST check the most granular license definition available, rather
   than assume license inheritance without checking.

2.4.  Relationship with the "atom:rights" element

   License link relations are related to the "atom:rights" element in
   that both are intended to communicate information about the rights
   associated with an Atom document.  Where the two differ, however, is
   in the fact that "atom:rights" is intended strictly as a human-
   readable assertion of rights held over a work while the license link
   relation is intended to provide a potentially machine-readable
   description of what rights have been granted to others.  The two
   constructs may overlap one another and conflicts could arise if they
   are contradictory.  It is important that publishers of Atom documents
   ensure that the "atom:rights" and license link relations are
   consistent with one another.


3.  Security Considerations

   When "license" link relations are used in Atom documents, the
   security considerations specified in [RFC4287] Section 8 apply.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines one new Atom link relation type to be
   registered in the IANA Registry of Link Relations as defined by
   [RFC4287].
       Attribute Value: license
       Description: Specifies the IRI of a license associated with
                    the containing feed, entry or source element.
                    Expected display characteristics: None
       Security considerations: When "license" link relations are used
                    in Atom documents, the security considerations for
                    handling links in Atom documents apply.
