1.   Introduction

   ISAKMP provides a framework to negotiate and derive Security
   Associations.  But since it is used within the IPSec framework, it
   may also be used to configure secure hosts.  This configuration may
   take place between a gateway, an end-host client, or a
   configuration manager.  For example, this can be used to configure
   multi-protocol IP tunnels securely.

   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the terms and
   concepts described in the "Security Architecture for the Internet
   Protocol" [Atkinson95] and "IP Security Document Roadmap"
   [Thayer97] documents.

   Readers are advised to be familiar with both [Harkins97] and
   [ISAKMP] because of the terminology used within this document and
   the fact that this document is an extension of both of those
   documents.


1.1. Specification of Requirements

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
   NOT", and "MAY" that appear in this document are to be interpreted
   as described in [Bradner97].

Internet Draft      The ISAKMP Configuration Mode         October, 97


2.   Configuration Mode

   Configuration Mode uses an XCHG type of 34 for the ISAKMP header.
   This mode MUST NOT be used prior to establishment of an ISAKMP
   Phase 1 Security Association.

           Initiator                        Responder
          -----------                      -----------
           HDR*, HASH, CFG      -->
                                   <--      HDR*, HASH, CFG

   where HASH is the prf output, using SKEYID_a as the key, and the
   message-ID from the ISAKMP header concatenated with the entire CFG
   payload, including attributes.  In other words the hashes for the
   above exchange are:

         HASH = prf(SKEYID_a, M-ID | CFG)

   Only one CFG payload MAY be present in one exchange of this mode.


3.   Configuration Transaction

   A "Configuration Transaction" is defined as two Configuration Mode
   exchanges, the first being either a Set or a Request and the second
   being either a Acknowledge or a Reply respectively.  The Message ID
   within the ISAKMP header identifies the configuration transaction
   and MUST NOT be zero.

   There are two paradigms to follow for this mode.

   o "Set/Acknowledge" works on the push principle that allows a
     configuration manager (a host that wishes to send information to
     another) to start the configuration transaction.  The
     Acknowledge code MUST return zero length attributes that it
     accepted.  Those attributes that it did not accept will NOT be
     sent back in the acknowledgement.

   o "Request/Reply" allows a host to request information from an
     informed host (a configuration manager).  Attributes in the
     Request exchange may have values filled in to request these
     values once again.  The Reply exchange MAY wish to choose those
     values, or return new values.  It MAY also add new attributes
     and not include some requested attributes.

   Transactions are completed once the Reply or Acknowledge code is
   received.  If one is not received, the implementation MAY wish to
   retransmit the original exchange.




R. Pereira, S. Anand                                          [Page 3]
Internet Draft      The ISAKMP Configuration Mode         October, 97


   If a badly formatted exchange is received, the exchange SHOULD be
   dropped and logged locally, as per local policy.  Badly formatted
   exchanges would also include those with unknown codes or unknown
   attributes within the Configuration Mode.


3.1. Configuration Codes

    Code                       Value
   ========================== ===========
    ISKAMP_CFG_REQUEST         1
    ISKAMP_CFG_REPLY           2
    ISKAMP_CFG_SET             3
    ISKAMP_CFG_ACK             4
    Reserved for future use    5 - 127
    Reserved for private use   128 - 255


4.   Configuration Payload

   The Configuration Payload is used to accomplish configuration
   transactions between two secure hosts.  Its "next payload" value is
   13.
                         1                   2                   3

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    | Next Payload  |   RESERVED    |         Payload Length        |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |     Code      |   RESERVED    |     Number of Attributes      |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                                                               |
    ~                         Attributes                            ~
    |                                                               |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+

   The Configuration Payload fields are defined as follows:

   o Next Payload (1 octet) - Identifier for the payload type of the
     next payload in the message.  If the current payload is the last
     in the message, then this field will be 0.  For the
     Configuration Mode, this field MUST be 0, since there is never a
     next payload.

   o RESERVED (1 octet) - Unused, set to 0.

   o Payload Length (2 octets) - Length in octets of the entire
     Configuration payload, including the Configuration payload
     header and all of the attributes.




R. Pereira, S. Anand                                          [Page 4]
Internet Draft      The ISAKMP Configuration Mode         October, 97


   o Code (1 octet) - A code that represents a command to be
     fulfilled or an action that has been completed.  Please see
     Section 4.1 for a description of each code.

   o RESERVED (1 octet) - Unused, set to 0.

   o Number of Attributes (2 octets) - States the number of
     attributes to follow.  Note that both the payload length and the
     number of attributes field may be used to process the
     attributes.

   o Attributes (variable) - One or more data attributes as defined
     in [ISAKMP], section 3.3.  Please see a later section for more
     information on the contents of these attributes.



5.   Configuration Attributes

    Attribute                  Value   Type             Length
   ========================== ======= ================ ============
    INTERNAL_IP4_ADDRESS       1       Variable         4 octets
    INTERNAL_IPX_ADDRESS       2       Variable         6 octets
    INTERNAL_NB_ADDRESS        3       Variable         16 octets
    INTERNAL_IP4_DNS           4       Variable         4 octets
    INTERNAL_IP4_NBNS          5       Variable         4 octets
    RENEW_SECONDS              6       Basic/Variable   2 or 4 octets
    USE_IP4_DHCP               7       Variable         4 octets
    Reserved for future use    8-63
    Reserved for private use   64-127

   o INTERNAL_IP4_ADDRESS - Specifies an IPv4 address within the
     internal network.  This address is sometimes called a red node
     address.  This address is sometimes an illegal address on the
     Internet.

   o INTERNAL_IPX_ADDRESS - Specifies an IPX address within the
     internal network.

   o INTERNAL_NB_ADDRESS - Specifies a NetBios address within the
     internal network.

   o INTERNAL_IP4_DNS - Specifies an IPv4 address of a DNS server
     within the network.

   o INTERNAL_IP4_NBNS - Specifies an IPv4 address of a NetBios Name
     Server (WINS) within the network.




R. Pereira, S. Anand                                          [Page 5]
Internet Draft      The ISAKMP Configuration Mode         October, 97


   o RENEW_SECONDS - Specifies the number of seconds that the host
     can use all of the information set within the configuration
     transaction.  The host MUST renew this information before this
     expiry time and MUST not use any of the information obtained
     through the configuration transaction after the expiry time.

   o USE_IP4_DHCP - Instructs the host to request any subsequent
     information through the DHCP protocol.  This attribute holds the
     IPv4 address of a DHCP server.

  It is hoped that more attribute types will be defined in the
  future.  Some suggestions would be to distribute local policy, or
  even authentication certificates.  Also, note that no
  recommendations are made to how an implementation actually figures
  out what information to send.  i.e. we do not recommend any
  specific method of (a gateway) determining which DNS server should
  be returned to a requesting host.



6.   Security Considerations

  This entire draft discusses a new ISAKMP mode to allow entities in
  the network to acquire and share configuration information.

  The draft mandates that this exchange always occur after the Phase
  I Security Association has been set up and that the entire exchange
  be protected by the Phase I SA.  Thus the exchange is as secure as
  any Phase II SA.
