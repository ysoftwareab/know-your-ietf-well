   Abstract 
    
   This document describes extensions to RSVP-TE to support a new 
   message type called a "Path computation" message.  This message is to 
   be used between an LSR and a Path Computation Server, which may be an 
   LSR or a centralized path computation tool. An RSVP Path Computation 
   Request message is used by the head-end LSR to send its request to 
   the Path Computation Server. The Path Computation Server in turn 
   sends an RSVP Path Computation Reply message containing either: 
        - a positive reply, containing one or more paths, if the request  
          can be satisfied. 
        - a negative reply if no path obeying the requested constraints

          can be found. The Path Computation Server may also optionally  
          suggest new constraint values for which one or several paths  
          could be found. 
   There are many situations where a Path Computation Server may be 
   used. A typical example is in the context of Inter-area MPLS TE. A 
   head-end LSR could request that a Path Computation Server compute one 
   or more paths obeying a specified set of constraints for a TE LSP 
   spanning multiple areas. The path computation server could be a 
   centralized path computation server or an ABR. Another example is the 
   use of a Path Computation Server to compute diversely routed paths 
   between two end points.  This may be useful in the context of MPLS TE 
   LSP Path protection or GMPLS LSP Path protection. The computation of 
   Multi-constraints paths requires intensive CPU resources, and may be 
   yet another usage example. Lastly, those protocol extensions could be 
   used as a "UNI" like protocol between a CE (Customer Edge equipment) 
   and a PE (Provider Edge equipment) where the CE is not part of the 
   PE's IGP domain.

1.      Introduction 
    
   As mentioned in the abstract, there are various situations where a 
   Path Computation Client may need to compute one or more paths obeying 
   a specified set of constraints, and may ask a Path Computation Server 
   to perform this task. This exchange does not allocate any resources, 
   it is simply a mechanism by which a client may send a path 
   computation request to a server and get in return a reply (positive 
   or negative). Note also this is not related to policy.  
    
   Let's briefly describe a typical sequence of events: 
    
   1) the Path Computation Client (an LSR) sends a request to the Path 
   Computation Server (LSR, centralized path computation tool,...). A Path 
   Computation Request message will be sent containing: 
        a) already specified objects defined in [9] characterizing the    
           request, and  
        b) new objects defined in the present draft related  
           to the request. 
    
   2) the Path Computation Request message is sent to the Path 
   Computation Server 
    
   3) the Path Computation Server processes the request and sends 
   either: 
        a) a positive reply to the client containing one or more  
           computed paths that obey the requested constraints, 
        b) a negative reply to the client, with optionally some  
           additional information suggesting new constraints values for  
           which the request would have been positive. 
    
   4) the Path Computation Client can in turn: 
        a) If the reply is positive 
             i) If the client has sent the same request to several      
                servers in parallel 
                     1. Compare the reply with other replies it received  
                        from other servers. 
                     2. Select the preferred path. 
               Otherwise, select the returned path. 
             ii) Establish the LSP using RSVP with extensions as defined  
                 in [9] 
        b) If the reply is negative 
             i) Send another request to the Path Computation Server with  
                new constraints (potentially taking into account the  
                returned suggested constraints values by the server, if  
                any) 
             ii) Wait for an answer from other servers, if any. 
             iii) Go to 4).

2.      Terminology 
    
   Terminology used in this draft 
    
   PCS: Path Computation Server (may be any kind of LSR (ABR, ASBR, ...) 
   or a centralized path computation server 
    
   PCC: Path Computation Client (any head-end LSR) requesting a path 
   computation of the Path Computation Server. 
    
    
3.      RSVP Path computation Request/Reply messages 
    
   As defined in rfc2205, an RSVP message consists of a common header 
   followed by a body consisting of a variable number of variable-
   length, typed "objects". As a reminder, the common header format is: 
    
            0             1              2             3 
            +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ 
            | Vers | Flags|  Msg Type   |       RSVP Checksum       | 
            +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ 
            |  Send_TTL   | (Reserved)  |        RSVP Length        | 
            +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ 
    
   See RFC2205 for details. 
    
   One new RSVP message type is defined in this draft: a Path 
   Computation Message.  The message type is [TBD by IANA]. 
    
   The Flags field is used to identify whether the message is a path 
   computation request or a reply.  Each has different contents, defined 
   below. Flags 0x01-0x8 are reserved. A request has its flag set to 
   [TBD by IANA] and a reply has its flag set to [TBD by IANA]. 
    
   An RSVP Path Computation Request message is sent by an LSR to request 
   one or more path computations of a Path Computation Server obeying a 
   set of specified constraints. The objects carried in this message may 
   include those defined in [8] and [9], new objects defined in this 
   draft, as well as other objects that may be defined in the future 
   characterizing, for instance, the constraints of the LSP for which 
   one or several paths should be computed. The IP source address is the 
   IP address of the requesting LSR and the IP destination address is 
   the IP address of the Path Computation Server. 
    
   An RSVP Path Computation Reply message is sent by the PCS to the 
   requesting LSR (PCC) to return one or more computed Paths, if any. 
   The object(s) carried will include one or more EROs (Explicit Route 
   Objects), as defined in [9], plus additional objects defined in this 
   draft. If no path can be found, the PCS reply will be negative.  An 
   ERROR_SPEC object will be carried in the reply, and optionally 
   additional information as defined in section 3.3.4. The source IP 

 
  Vasseur et. al                                                     4 
 








 
              draft-vasseur-mpls-computation-rsvp-01.txt November 2001 
 
   address will be the IP address of the PCS and the destination IP 
   address will be the IP address of the PCC. 
    
   RSVP Path computation messages are sent without the router alert 
   option. Path computation messages should be sent in reliable mode as 
   defined in RFC2961. This allows an acknowledgment message to be used 
   to acknowledge the receipt of a Path computation message (request and 
   reply). In case of message loss, the message will be fast 
   retransmitted as defined in RFC2961. Note that the DSCP field of the 
   IP packet carrying an RSVP Path Computation message may be set 
   appropriately to provide the appropriate quality of service delivery 
   to the packet. 
    
   The same Path Computation Request may be sent to several PCSs. In 
   this case, the decision process used by the PCC to select from among 
   (possibly) multiple replies is a local decision and is beyond the 
   scope of this document.  
    
    
3.1.    RSVP Path Computation Request Message Format 
    
   The Path Computation Request message format is as follows: 
       
   The Flags field of the common header must be set to [TBD] by IANA to 
   identify a request. 
    
   <Path computation request> ::=  <Common Header> [ <INTEGRITY> ] 
                                   [ <MESSAGE_ID_ACK> |  
                                   <MESSAGE_ID_NACK>] ... ] 
                                   [ <MESSAGE_ID> ] 
                                   <SESSION>  
                                   <REQUEST_ID>  
                                   [ <NB_PATH> ] 
                                   [ <EXPLICIT_ROUTE> ] 
                                   [<METRIC_TYPE>]               
                                   [<EXCLUDE_ELEMENT>]   
                                   [ <SESSION_ATTRIBUTE> ] 
                                   [ <POLICY_DATA> ... ] 
                                   <sender descriptor> 
    
         <sender descriptor> ::=  <SENDER_TEMPLATE> <SENDER_TSPEC> 
                                  [ <ADSPEC> ] 
                                  [ <RECORD_ROUTE> ] 
    
   One new (mandatory) object is defined: REQUEST_ID to identify the 
   request. This object is also used to indicate the request's priority 
   and LSP type. See 3.3.1 for details. 
    
   The SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object (class=207, C-type=1) allows carrying 
   setup and holding priorities, resource affinities, etc.  Other 
   constraints may also be carried in the Path Computation message. Note 

 
  Vasseur et. al                                                     5 
 








 
              draft-vasseur-mpls-computation-rsvp-01.txt November 2001 
 
   that any other constraints that could be defined in the future can be 
   expressed as new objects. 
    
   The ERO object may also be present in the RSVP Path Computation 
   Request.  The reason is that the head-end may want to specify some 
   LSR(s) that the LSP must traverse.  At least one sub-object in the 
   ERO must have its L flag bit set to 1, referring to a loose hop. 
    
   The optional METRIC_TYPE object allows the PCC to specify the metric 
   the PCS must use in its CSPF to select the "best" path obeying the 
   requested constraints. See the METRIC_TYPE object definition in 3.3.2 
   for more details. 
    
   The optional NB_PATH object (defined in 3.3.5) allows the PCC to 
   specify the number of requested paths to the PCS for the specific set 
   of constraints specified in the RSVP Path Computation Request 
   message. 
    
3.2.    RSVP Path Computation Reply message format 
    
   The Path Computation Reply message format is as follows: 
    
   The Flags field of the common header must be set to [TBD by IANA] to 
   identify a Path Computation Reply. 
       
   <Path Computation Reply>::=<Common Header> [ <INTEGRITY> ] 
                              [<MESSAGE_ID_ACK> | <MESSAGE_ID_NACK>]...] 
                              [ <MESSAGE_ID> ] 
                              <REQUEST_ID> 
                              [ <NB_PATH> ]  
                              [<EXPLICIT_ROUTE> [<PATH_COST>] ] ... 
                              [ <ERROR_SPEC>] 
                              [<NO_PATH_AVAILABLE] ] 
                              [ <POLICY_DATA> ... ] 
                                    
   The REQUEST_ID is the same REQUEST_ID (contains the same value) as 
   the one contained in the Path Computation Request to which the reply 
   corresponds. 
    
   In case of a negative reply (no path obeying the constraints can be 
   found), the PCS must send a reply containing an ERROR_SPEC object 
   with: 
        - ERROR_CODE [TBD by IANA] and ERROR_VALUE [TBD by IANA] 
        - "Ipv4 Error Node address" ("Ipv6 Error Node address") set to  
          the Ipv4 (Ipv6) address of the PCS.  This must be the same IP  
          address as was used in the Path Computation Request message. 
    
   There are various reasons why the Path Computation Server may not be 
   able to satisfy the request: 
    
        - the Path Computation Request message was not valid ("unknown  
          object class (error_code=23, "unknown object C-type  
 
  Vasseur et. al                                                     6 
 








 
              draft-vasseur-mpls-computation-rsvp-01.txt November 2001 
 
          (error_code=14), "Routing problem" (error_code=24), ...), ... See  
          [8] and [9] for details. In such a situation, the PCS must  
          send the Path Computation Reply message without any ERO  
          objects and without NO_PATH_AVAILABLE object. 
    
        - No path can be found obeying the set of requested constraints.  
          If no path can be found by the PCS for the specified  
          constraints, and only in this situation, a NO_PATH_AVAILABLE  
          object may be inserted into the RSVP Path Computation Reply  
          message sent by the PCS.  
          This object (defined in section 3.3.4) is optional and may  
          specify the constraint(s) that explain(s) why no path has been  
          found. In addition, the PCS may use the NO_PATH_AVAILABLE  
          object to suggest new constraint values for which a path can  
          be found. 
          In such a situation, the Path Computation Reply message must  
          not contain any ERO objects. 
    
   Note that a Path Computation Reply message may contain several EROs 
   if and only if several paths have been requested by the LSR in its 
   Path Computation Request message using the new NB_PATH object (see 
   3.3.5). 
    
   Moreover, multiple replies may be combined in the same Path 
   Computation Reply message.  This is done using a list of EROs, each 
   following its corresponding REQUEST_ID as shown in the example below.  
    
   A reply should not be delayed in order to bundle several path 
   computation results for requests whose priority REQUEST_ID field (see 
   3.3.1) has been set to "high".  
    
   As an example, if a PCC sends several requests: 
   - L low priority requests with REQUEST_ID = R(i) I=1 ... L 
   - P high priority requests with REQUEST_ID = R'(i) I=1 ... P 
   Then the PCS MUST reply to every high priority request as soon as the 
   computation result is completed. On the other hand, the low priority 
   request results could be bundled in the SAME Path Computation Reply 
   message using the following format: <REQUEST_ID R(1)> <ERO(1)> 
   <REQUEST_ID R(2)> <ERO(2)> <ERO (2)> ... <REQUEST_ID R(L)> <ERO(L)>. 
   If no path can be found for a specific request, an individual 
   negative Path Computation Reply message must be sent for the 
   corresponding request. 
    
   A PATH_COST object (defined 3.3.3) may be inserted and follow each 
   ERO object if and only if the PCC has requested the PCS to provide 
   the cost of each computed path in its Path Computation Request 
   message (the "C" bit in the flag field of the REQUEST_ID object 
   present in the path computation request must be set).

3.3.    New RSVP objects used in Path Computation messages 
    
3.3.1.  REQUEST_ID Object 
    
   The REQUEST_ID object must be used in every Path Computation Request 
   message and in every Path Computation Reply message. 
    
   REQUEST_ID Class-Num is [TBD] 
   REQUEST_ID C-Type is [TBD] 
    
        0                   1                   2                   3

       |                        Request_ID_number                      | 
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   Flags: 6 bits 
    
   C (Cost): when set, the PCC does require the PCS to indicate the 
   path's computed cost in its reply. 
    
   T (Type of reply: Partial or complete): In a request, when set, this 
   specifies the returned path must be complete (set of directly 
   connected LSRs). When this bit is cleared, the returned path may be 
   complete or partial (set of loose hops). In a reply, when set, this 
   indicates the returned path is complete. If the returned path is 
   partial, this bit is cleared. 
    
   R (Reoptimization): when set, the PCC specifies that the request 
   concerns a reoptimization (a new path computation for a TE LSP 
   already in place). This requires for the PCC to provide the path of 
   the TE LSP in place in the path computation request to avoid double 
   counting. The ERO must be formed of strict hops only.  
    
   B (Bi-directional): when set, the PCC specifies the TE LSP is bi-
   directional. When cleared, the TE LSP is unidirectional.  
    
   Pri (Priority): 2 bits 
    
   This field may be used for the requesting LSR to specify to the PCS 
   the urgency of this request. The decision of which priority should be 
   used for a specific request is a local matter and must be set to 0 
   when unused. A possible use of this field is when several 
   computations may be requested, each having different timing 
   requirements: typically a request for a reoptimization would have a 
   lower priority than a re-routing request. 
    
   0x0: normal. No timing requirement specified. 
   0x3: high. Urgent request to be served as soon as possible.

   Epoch: 24 bits 
    
   Epoch is as described in RFC2961 and can be the same number. 
    
   Request_ID_number: 32 bits 
    
   This value (combined with the IP address of the PCC) uniquely 
   identifies the Path Computation Request the message refers to and is 
   incremented every time a new request is sent to the PCS. If no Path 
   computation reply is received from the PCS, the request may be resent 
   with the same Request_ID_number. 
   The same Request_ID_number may be sent to different PCS's. The Path 
   Computation Reply will be identified by the IP source address of the 
   sender. 
    
   The presence of the REQUEST_ID object is mandatory in every Path 
   Computation Request and Reply message. 
    
    
3.3.2.  METRIC_TYPE 
    
   The METRIC_TYPE object may be used in Path Computation Request 
   message. This object is optional. 
    
   When computing the path(s) obeying a set of specified constraints, 
   the PCS will run a CSPF and will select the "shortest" path from the 
   subset of the topology which meets the constraints.  The shortest 
   Path is defined as the path having the lowest cost for a specific 
   metric. This metric can be the IGP metric, the Traffic Engineering 
   metric, or any other metric defined in the future. See also [11] and 
   [12] for a discussion on the use of the metric in the path 
   computation. The METRIC_TYPE object is used by the PCC to indicate 
   the PCS which metric to be used in its CSPF. When the METRIC_TYPE 
   object is not present, the PCS must use the TE metric.

   Subobjects 
    
      The contents of  the  METRIC_TYPE  object  are  a  series  of 
      variable-length  data  items called subobjects.  The subobjects

      The Length contains the total length of the subobject in bytes, 
      including the metric_type and Length fields.  The Length MUST be   
      at least 4, and MUST be a multiple of 4.

   The metric_value subobject object will not be present in a path 
   computation request. 
    
   Note that the PCC may specify multiple metrics in its request. 
    
   In such a case, the PCS must: 
   - compute the shortest path(s) obeying the specified set of 
   constraints for every metric, 
   - provide in its reply the shortest path(s) for each metric since the 
   PCC has required the shortest path for more than one metric. This 
   means that the PCS must, for each metric type, provides the ERO and 
   optionally the corresponding cost (see 3.3.3). A PATH_COST object 
   will follow the ERO object in the reply that will specify the 
   metric_type and optionally the metric_value.

3.3.3.  PATH_COST 
    
   The PATH_COST object is used in Path Computation Reply message. 
    
   It may be desirable for the PCC to request that the PCS return not 
   only the computed paths but also their corresponding costs.  The cost 
   of the path is defined as the sum of the link metrics (IGP or TE 
   metric) along this path. As defined in 3.3.1, the PCC will set the 
   "C" bit of the Flag field in the REQUEST_ID object of its Path 
   Computation Request message to indicate the path(s) cost must be 
   provided by the PCS in its reply (if the reply is positive). 
    
   When the PCS returns one or more computed paths to the PCC: 
   - if the "C" bit of the REQUEST_ID flag has not been set in the Path 
   Computation Request message, the PCS may or not provide the Path(s) 
   cost, 
   - if the "C" bit of the REQUEST_ID flag has been set in the Path 
   Computation Request message, the PCS must, for every ERO, include a 
   PATH_COST object specifying the cost of the computed path for the 
   requested metric(s). The requested metric is specified in the 
   METRIC_TYPE Object received in the Path Computation Request. 
    
   As mentioned in the previous section, there is another situation 
   where the PCS must include a PATH_COST object for every computed ERO: 
   when the request has been received with a METRIC_TYPE object 
   specifying more than one metric. In this case, the PCS will also add 
   one PATH_COST object for every ERO specifying the metric for which 
   the ERO corresponds to the shortest path. 
    
   The PATH_COST object will be made of subobjects identifying the 
   metric type and the associated value.

   The same subobjects as previously defined will be used. 
    
   The IGP metric of a computed path is defined as the sum of the IGP 
   metrics of each link along the path. The TE metric of a computed path 
   is defined as the sum of the TE metrics of each link along the path.

   In the following examples, not all optional objects are mentioned and 
   we suppose positive answers. 
    
   Example 1 
    
   Request 
   <SESSION> 
   <REQUEST_ID>=a, "C" bit=0x1 
   <METRIC_TYPE>: TE metric 
   <sender descriptor> 
    
   The PCC sends a request for the computation of one path obeying the 
   set of specified constraints. The returned path must be the shortest 
   path using the TE metric and must specify the associated cost. 
    
   Reply 
   REQUEST_ID=a 
   <ERO 1> 
   <PATH_COST>: metric_type="TE", metric_value=C1 (sum of the TE metric 
   of the links along the path for ERO 1) 
    
   Note: if the "C" bit is cleared in the RESQUEST_ID object of the path 
   computation request, the PCS may (but is not required to) return the 
   computed path(s) with PATH_COST objects. 
    
   Example 2 
    
   Request 
   <SESSION> 
   <REQUEST_ID>=a, "C" bit=0x1 
   <METRIC_TYPE>: IGP metric & TE metric 
   <sender descriptor> 
    
   The PCC sends a request for the computation of one path obeying the 
   set of specified constraints. The returned path must be the shortest 
   path using the TE metric. 
    
   Reply 
   REQUEST_ID=a 
   <ERO 1> 
   <PATH_COST>: metric_type="TE", metric_value=C1 (sum of the IGP metric 
   of the links along the path for ERO 1) 
   <ERO 2> 
   <PATH_COST>: metric_type="IGP", metric_value=C2 (sum of the TE metric 
   of the links along the path for ERO 2) 
    
    
3.3.4.  NO_PATH_AVAILABLE object 
    
   The NO_PATH_AVAILABLE object may be used in Path Computation Reply 
   message. This object is optional.

   When present, it allows the PCS to: 
   - indicate the unsatisfied constraint (the reason why no path can be 
   found) 
   - (optionally) suggest a new value for the constraint (the closest 
   value of the required one) for which a path could be found.  This may 
   be used by the requesting LSR to resend a new request with the 
   suggested value. The PCS may not be capable of suggesting a new 
   value.

   Flags: 8 bits 
    
   0x00: the PCS indicates the constraint for which no path can be found 
   but does not suggest any other value for the constraint for which a 
   path could be found. 
   0x01: the PCS indicates the constraint for which no path can be found 
   and suggests another value for this constraint (as close as possible 
   to the original requested constraint) for which a path could be 
   found. This value is indicated in the suggested_value field. 
   0x02: the PCS indicates that no path can be found with the requested 
   constraints but an unconstrained path could be found. In this case 
   both the Contraint_type and Suggested_value fields must be set to 0.
         
    
   Constraint_type: 16 bits 
    
   Defines the constraint for which no path has been found by the Path 
   Computation Server. 
    
   0x0001 = no path can be found with the requested bandwidth 
   0x0002 = no path can be found with the requested protection 
   0x0003 = no path can be found with the requested class affinity  
            attribute 
   0x0004 = the path-correlation requested cannot be satisfied 
   0x0005 = no path can be found since the LSP was requested as bi-    
            directional 
    
   Suggested_value: 32 bits 
    
   The PCS may, for each constraint, suggest a value (potentially the 
   closest to the requested constraint in the original Path computation 
   request) for which a path could be found. In this case, the flag must 
 
  Vasseur et. al                                                    13 
 








 
              draft-vasseur-mpls-computation-rsvp-01.txt November 2001 
 
   be set to 0x01. For example, if a bandwidth of X is requested by the 
   head-end LSR and a path may be found but with a bandwidth of Y (with 
   Y<X), Y may be mentioned by the Path Computation Server in the 
   Suggested_value field.  
    
   The suggested_value field must be set to 0x00000000 if the flag field 
   is set to 0x00. 
    
   Note that several NO_PATH_AVAILABLE objects may be included in the 
   Path Computation Reply message so that the PCS may indicate the list 
   of constraints for which no path has been found. In the specific case 
   where just an unconstrained path can be found, the Path Computation 
   Server will return a single NO_AVAILABLE_PATH object with the 
   Flags=0x02 (this simplifies the RSVP message in this particular case, 
   instead of having to include one NO_AVAILABLE_PATH per constraint). 
    
   A PCS is not required to support the capability of identifying the 
   constraint(s) that cannot be satisfied, and suggesting other values 
   for the constraint(s).  
    
    
3.3.5.  NB_PATH object 
    
   The NB_PATH object may be used in Path Computation Request message 
   and Path Computation Reply messages. This object is optional in the 
   Path Computation Request message. When present in the Path 
   Computation Request message, it must be also present in the 
   corresponding Path Computation Reply message.  
    
   There are many situations where a PCC may desire to get more than one 
   LSP (and so more than one path) between two points: 
   - when a request cannot be satisfied (for instance no LSP having a 
   bandwidth B can be set up) the PCC may decide to set up several TE 
   LSPs (so that the total amount of their bandwidth is equal to B) and 
   perform load balancing, 
   - with path protection to compute both the primary and backup TE LSP 
   (in this case they must be diversely routed),  
   - ... 
    
   Two different scenarios will be covered in this section: 
   - the PCS requests the computation of N (potentially correlated) 
   paths having the same set of constraints. By correlated, we mean 
   link/node/SRLG diverse. 
   - the PCS requests the computation of N correlated paths each path 
   having a different set of constraints. Such a request is called a 
   global request and is made of individual requests. For each 
   individual request, a specific path computation request message is 
   sent to the PCS. A global path computation request is said satisfied 
   if each individual request can be satisfied with their corresponding 
   correlation.

   0x01: the PCS requests the computation of number_path correlated 
   paths having different set of constraints. The set of constraints of 
   each path is defined in a different Path computation request message 
   identified by the REQUEST_ID_number. The list of requests is 
   specified in the PATH_CORRELATED object (defined above). Note that in 
   this case, the PCS starts the path computation after having received 
   the number_path Path computation request. 
    
   0x02: this flag is only meaningful in a path computation reply and is 
   used: 
        - when the PCS specifies a global path computation request  
          cannot be satisfied,

   0x001: the various paths must be diversely routed (link diverse) 
   0x002: the various paths must be diversely routed (node diverse) 
   0x003: the various paths must be diversely routed (SRLG disjoint) 
   0x004: the various paths must be diversely routed (link and SRLG) 
   0x005: the various paths must be diversely routed (node and SRLG) 
    
   number_path 
    
   Defines the number of requested paths obeying the specified 
   constraints to the Path Computation Server. The number_ERO must 
   always be strictly greater to 1. If just one path is required no 
   NB_PATH object must be inserted in the request. When the value 0xFFFF

   is specified, the PCC requires the computation of all the paths 
   satisfying the set of specified constraints. 
    
    
   It may of course not be possible to compute number_path paths that 
   obey the specified constraints; this will be more likely the case if 
   diverse routing is requested.  
    
   A NB_PATH object must be used in every Path Computation Reply message 
   if the corresponding Path Computation Request message also contained 
   an NB_PATH object.  
    
   If the PCS requests the computation of (potentially correlated) 
   number_path paths sharing the same set of constraints: 
    
        - The flag of the NB_PATH object in the Path computation request  
          must be set to 0x00, 
    
        If the reply is positive: If N EROs have been requested  
        (number_path=N in the NB_PATH object of the request), the  
        number_path field of NB_PATH in the reply is N. 
    
        If the reply is negative: the number_path field of NB_PATH in  
        the Path computation reply contains the number of paths that  
        could be computed by the PCS. If N EROs have been requested  
        (number_path=N in the NB_PATH object of the request) but the PCS  
        can only find M EROs obeying the constrains (M<N), the PCS will  
        return a Path Computation Reply message with an NB_PATH object  
        where number_path=M. No ERO object will be inserted in the reply  
        since the reply is negative. The reply will also contain an  
        ERROR_SPEC object, and may also include one or more  
        NO_PATH_AVAILABLE objects. 
    
   If the PCS requests the computation of number_path correlated paths 
   having different set of constraints. The NB_PATH object must just be 
   present in the first of number_path requests. 
    
        - The flag of the NB_PATH object in the Path computation request  
          must be set to 0x01, 
        - The path computation request must contain a PATH_CORRELATED  
          object listing the number_path REQUEST_ID. The set of  
          constraints of each path is defined in number_path path  
          computation requests, 
        - The number_path field of NB_PATH in the path computation reply  
          contains the number of paths that could be computed by the PCS  
          with their respective constraints. No ERO object will be  
          inserted in the reply since the reply is negative. The reply  
          will also contain an ERROR_SPEC object, and may also include  
          one or more NO_PATH_AVAILABLE objects, 
    
        If the reply is positive: If N correlated paths have been  
        requested (number_path=N in the NB_PATH object of the request),

              draft-vasseur-mpls-computation-rsvp-01.txt November 2001 
 
        the number_path field of NB_PATH in the reply is N. 
    
        If the reply is negative: the number_path field of NB_PATH in  
        the Path computation reply contains the number of correlated  
        paths that could be computed by the PCS. If N path computation  
        have been requested (number_PATH=N in the NB_PATH object of the  
        request) but the PCS can only find M paths obeying the  
        constrains (M<N), the PCS will return a Path Computation Reply  
        message with an NB_PATH object where number_path=M. The PCS will  
        also include a PATH_CORRELATED object listing the set of  
        requests that could not be satisfied (identified by their  
        REQUEST_ID_number). No ERO object will be inserted in the reply  
        since the reply is negative. The reply will also contain an  
        ERROR_SPEC object. 
    
        Optionally for each request that could not be satisfied the PCS  
        could also suggest a value for the global request to be  
        satisfied. In this case the flag 0x02 is the NB_PATH object will  
        be set and the PCS will send exactly N-M replies, each reply  
        containing a NO_PATH_AVAILABLE object. 
    
   Example 1 (Path computation of N paths sharing the same set of 
   constraints). 
    
   The PCC sends a request to the PCS with the following constraints: 
    
   Request 
   <SESSION> 
   <REQUEST_ID>=a 
   <NB_PATH>: flag=0x00, number_PATH=N, Path_correlation=0x02 (Node 
   diversely routed paths) 
   sender descriptor: bw=x, ... 
    
   If just M (M<N) paths can be found by the PCS with the requested 
   constraints but N such paths can be found if the requested bandwidth 
   is y (y<x), then the PCS may send the path computation reply of this 
   form: 
    
   Reply 
   REQUEST_ID=a 
   <ERROR_SPEC> (specifying a negative reply) 
   <NB_PATH>: number_PATH=M, Path_correlation=0x02 
   <NO_PATH_AVAILABLE>: Flags=0x01, Constraint_type=0x0001 (bandwidth), 
   Suggested_value=y 
    
   Which means: 
   - the reply is negative (the request cannot be satisfied with the 
   specified constraints) 
   - the unsatisfied constraint is "Bandwidth" 
   - Exactly M EROs (M<N) could be found with the requested constraints 
   - N node diversely routed path could be found if the bandwidth is set 
   to y. 
 
  Vasseur et. al                                                    17 
 








 
              draft-vasseur-mpls-computation-rsvp-01.txt November 2001 
 
    
   Then the PCC could decide to resend: 
   - a path computation request for M EROs and the same constraints as 
   in the previous request to get the M paths 
   - or a path computation request for N EROs but with the new suggested 
   value for the bandwidth (y). 
    
   Example 2 (Path computation of N=4 paths sharing different set of 
   constraints). 
    
   The PCC sends a request to the PCS with the following constraints: 
    
   Request 1 
   <SESSION> 
   <REQUEST_ID>=a 
   <NB_PATH>: flag=0x01, number_PATH=N=4, Path_correlation=0x02 (Node 
   diversely routed paths) 
   <PATH_CORRELATED>=a,b,c,d 
   sender descriptor: bw=x, ... 
    
   The PCS receives a Global path computation request for N=4 paths 
   sharing different set of constraints. The PCS will start the 
   computation after having received the N=4 path computation requests 
   having the request_ID_number a, b, c and d. 
    
   Request 2 
   <SESSION> 
   <REQUEST_ID>=b 
   sender descriptor: bw=y, ... 
    
   Request 3 
   <SESSION> 
   <REQUEST_ID>=c 
   sender descriptor: bw=z, ... 
    
   Request 3 
   <SESSION> 
   <REQUEST_ID>=d 
   sender descriptor: bw=w, ... 
    
    
   If the request cannot be satisfied, the PCS can optionally specify: 
   - the number of paths that could be satisfied with their respective 
   constraints, 
   - the set of requests that could not be satisfied in the 
   PATH_CORRELATED object. 
    
   Example:  
    
   Reply 1 
   REQUEST_ID=b 
   <ERROR_SPEC> (specifying a negative reply) 
 
  Vasseur et. al                                                    18 
 








 
              draft-vasseur-mpls-computation-rsvp-01.txt November 2001 
 
   <NB_PATH>: number_PATH=2, Path_correlation=0x02 
   <PATH_CORRELATED>: b,c 
   <NO_PATH_AVAILABLE>: Flags=0x01, Constraint_type=0x0001 (bandwidth), 
   Suggested_value=y' 
    
   Reply 2 
   REQUEST_ID=c 
   <ERROR_SPEC> (specifying a negative reply) 
   <NO_PATH_AVAILABLE>: Flags=0x01, Constraint_type=0x0001 (bandwidth), 
   Suggested_value=z' 
    
   Which means: 
   - the reply is negative (the global request cannot be satisfied with 
   the specified constraints) 
   - just 2 requests could be satisfied 
   - the requests whose resquest_ID_number are b and c could not be 
   satisfied 
   - the unsatisfied constraint for request b is "Bandwidth" 
   - the global request could be satisfied if the request bandwidth for 
   request b is y' and the requested bandwidth for c is z' 
    
   Then the PCC could decide to resend a new global path computation 
   request with the new suggested value. 
    
    
3.3.6.  PATH_CORRELATED object 
    
   The PATH_CORRELATED object may be used in Path Computation Request 
   message. This object is optional. 
    
   It allows the PCC to request to the PCS the computation of N 
   correlated paths having different set of constraints and contains the 
   list of the REQUEST_ID of those paths. 
    
   PATH_CORRELATED Class-Num is [TBD]

3.3.7.  EXCLUDE_ELEMENT object 
    
   The EXCLUDE_ELEMENT object may be used in Path Computation Request 
   message. This object is optional. 
    
   It allows the PCC to specify to the PCS another constraint related to 
   the computed path: the exclusion of one or more network elements in 
   the computed path.  A network element may be a link, an entire node 
   or even an Autonomous System. The EXCLUDED_ELEMENT object contains 
   the list of network elements to exclude from the computed path.  Each 
   network element is represented as a subobject.

3.3.8.  OPAQUE object 
    
   The OPAQUE object may be present in both Path Computation Request and 
   Reply message types. This object is optional. 
    
   The OPAQUE object may be used by the PCC to transfer information to 
   the PCS (in a Path Computation Request message) or by the PCS to 
   transfer information to the PCC (in a Path Computation Reply 
   message). Opaque object may be used for future extensions and the
