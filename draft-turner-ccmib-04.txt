Abstract

   This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
   community.  In particular, it describes managed objects for key
   management implementations including asymmetric keys, symmetric keys,
   trust anchors, and cryptographic-related firmware.

   This profile applies to the capabilities, configuration, and
   operation of all components of US National Security Systems (SP
   800-59).  It is also appropriate for other US Government systems that
   process high-value information.  It is made publicly available for
   use by developers and operators of these and any other system
   deployments.

4.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in RFC 2578
   [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579], and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

5.  MIB Design

   Eight MIB are defined as part of the CCMIB to support key management
   implementations, namely CC-ASSIGNMENTS-MIB, CC-FEATURE-HIERARCHY-MIB,
   CC-DEVICE-INFO-MIB, CC-KEY-MANAGEMENT-MIB, CC-KEY-TRANSFER-PULL-MIB,
   CC-KEY-TRANSFER-PUSH-MIB, CC-SECURE-POLICY-INFO-MIB, CC-SECURE-
   CONNECTION-INFO-MIB.  The following sections summarizes the modules
   and the modules' objects.

5.1.  CC-ASSIGNMENTS-MIB

   The Assignments MIB defines the "ccmib" OID, which is the OID prefix
   for all others definitions in the CCMIB.

5.2.  CC-FEATURE-HIERARCHY-MIB

   The Feature Hierarchy MIB defines OIDs for the remaining MIB modules,
   namely ccDeviceInfo, ccKeyManagement, ccKeyTransferPull,
   ccKeyTransferPush, ccSecurePolicyInfo, and ccSecureConnectionInfo.
   This module imports the ccmib OID from the Assignments MIB and the
   remaining 6 MIB modules import an OID from the Feature Hierarchy MIB.

5.3.  CC-DEVICE-INFO-MIB

   The Device Info MIB configures basic characteristics of the device.
   Details of the defined tables follow.

   cDeviceComponentVersTable is used to manage the specification
   versions of components or specifications supported by the ECU.

   cBatteryInfoTable is used to manage information on each of the
   batteries installed in the device, along with their type, operational
   status, and battery low notification thresehold.

Internet-Draft                  DoD CCMIB                   October 2019


   cFirmwareInformationTable is used to manage firmware versions
   available in the device, along with their versions, type, and source.

5.4.  CC-KEY-MANAGEMENT-MIB

   The Key Management MIB configures key management information related
   to the following types of keys:

   o  symmetric keys, e.g., [RFC6031]

   o  asymmetric keys, e.g., [RFC5280] and [RFC5958]

   o  trust anchors, e.g., [RFC5280] and [RFC5914],

   o  CRLs and CKLs, e.g., [RFC5280]

   o  encrypted keys, e.g., [RFC6032]

   Details of the defined tables follow.

   cSymmetricKeyTable is used to manage symmetric keys used by the
   device.  Each table entry supports values for fingerprint, usages,
   identifier, effective date, expiration date, expiry warning, number
   of transactions, friendly name, classification, and source.

   cAsymKeyTable is used to manage asymmetric keys used by the device.
   Each table entry supports values for fingerprint, friendly name,
   serial number, issuer, signature algorithm, public key algorithm,
   effective date, expiration date, expiry warning, subject, subject
   type, subject alternative name, usage, classification, source,
   version, rekey, and type as well as automatic rekey is enabled.

   cTrustAnchorTable is used to manage Trust Anchors used by the device.
   Each table entry supports fingerprint, format type, name, usage type,
   key identifier, public key algorithm, contingency availability, and
   version.

   cCKLTable is used to manage both CRLs and CKLs.  Each table entry
   supports an index, issuer, revoked serial number, issue date, next
   update, version, and last updated.

   cCDMStoreTable is used to manage the types of stored CDM that are
   destined for this device and/or destined for another device.  Types
   include symmetric key, asymmetric key, TA, CRL, CKL, and firmware as
   well as store and forward unencrypted and encrypted packages meant
   for another device.

   cCertSubAltNameTable is used to manage the devices subject
   alternative names [RFC5280].

   cCertPathCtrlsTable is used to manage the controls and constraints
   applied to a certificate in order to process certificate trust paths
   [RFC5280].

   cCertPolicyTable is used to manage the devices certificate policies
   [RFC5280].

   cPolicyMappingTable is used to manage the devices mapped certificate
   policies [RFC5280].

   cNameConstraintTable is used to manage the devices name constraints
   [RFC5280].

   cRemoteKeyMaterialTable is used to manage the key material
   information used by the remote peer, i.e., the key material used to
   establish the secure connection.

5.5.  CC-KEY-TRANSFER-PULL-MIB

   The Key Transfer Pull MIB configures information used by devices to
   retrieve CDM from CDM servers.  Details of the defined tables follow.

   cCDMServerTable is used to mange CDM servers that will be queried for
   available CDMs.  It is also used to obtain the location for the CDML,
   which is a list detailing available CDMs and their associated
   location for obtainment.  [I-D.turner-sodp-profile] is an example of
   a CDM server that contains a CDML, which is referred to as Product
   Availability List (PAL) in [I-D.turner-sodp-profile].

   cCDMDeliveryTable is used to manage information about cryptographic
   device materials (CDMs) that are ready/available for retrieval.

5.6.  CC-KEY-TRANSFER-PUSH-MIB

   The Key Transfer Push MIB configures information used by senders to
   push CDMs to devices.  Details of the defined tables follow.

   cCDMPushDestTable is used to manage the information a sender needs to
   initiate a CDM send to a receiving device.

   cCDMTransferPkgTable is used to configure single or multiple CDM in a
   package that can be transferred on a send operation.

   cCDMPushSrcTable provides is used to list the authorized senders that
   this receiving device will accept CDM transfers from.

5.7.  CC-SECURE-POLICY-INFO-MIB

   The Secure Policy Information MIB defines one table,
   cSecPolicyRuleTable, to manage the security policy rules that are
   compared against inbound and outbound data traffic flow to determine
   how the data traffic flow should be treated (e.g., protect, bypass,
   discard).

5.8.  CC-SECURE-CONNECTION-INFO-MIB

   The Secure Connection Information MIB defines one table,
   cSecConTable, to manage the base/common information for secure
   connections: data plane identifier, type (e.g., 'tls', 'ipsec'),
   direction (inbound, outbound, bidirectional), local and remote key
   material references, cryptographic suite, establishment time, and
   status.

            server information is stored in the cCDMServerTable. When
            read, it will return 'readyForDownload' if the last action
            succeeded. If the last action is in progress or failed, it
            will return the last requested action.

            The values which may be set depend on the current value of
            this object and the cCDMLDeliveryStatus object.

            In order to initiate a new download, this object must
            contain the value 'readyForDownload', and the
            cCDMLDeliveryStatus must contain the value 'complete'. At
            which point, setting this object to to 'downloadAndParse'
            initiates the CDML download process. Note, the
            cCDMLDeliveryStatus should transition to 'inProgress' as
            the device begins the CDML download process from the
            server(s) and URI(s) listed in the cCDMLServerTable (as
            ordered by the cCDMLServerPriority index).

            If the CDML download fails, the next highest priority URI
            will be tried, and so on.

            While a CDML download is in progress, or if the CDML
            download fails for all possible servers and URIs (indicated
            by a cCDMLDeliveryStatus value of 'downloadFailed'), this
            object will return an inconsistentValue error for any new
            value except 'discard' (which will cancel the current
            download).

            If the CDML download succeeded, the cCDMLDeliveryStatus
            value remains inProgress and the device attempts to parse
            the download immediately. During the parsing of the CDML,
            all new values will return inconsistentValue error (i.e.,
            the parse process can not be aborted). If the parse fails,
            the cCDMLDeliveryStatus will transition to 'parseFailed',
            and this object must be set to 'discard' before a new CDML
            download is attempted."

            consumption and an entry is to be configured in the
            appropriate MIB table based on cCDMType:

            [downloadAndStore] = Initiates a download of the CDM. After
            a successful download, an entry is created in the
            cCDMStoreTable to store the CDM.

            [discard] = Stops the current CDM delivery request and
            discards the CDM if potentially downloaded; this reverts the
            current value of the cCDMDeliveryStatus to 'complete'. If
            entries are created in the aforementioned tables for the
            install and store operations, these newly configured entries
            will be removed.

            The enumeration value of 'downloadAndStore' does not apply
            when cCDMType is set to 'notification'. 'downloadAndInstall'
            is used for a cCDMType of 'notification'.

            If this column is configured to any value except 'discard'
            while the value of cCDMDeliveryStatus is any value except
            'complete', the SNMP set operation must result in an
            inconsistentValue exception. The same applies if 'discard'

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no requests of IANA.  All of the object
   identifiers used in the document are defined in the IANA Private
   Enterprise Number (PEN) ccmib arc (34493).

8.  Security Considerations

   The CCMIB modules contain some read-only objects that may be deemed
   sensitive.  Appropriate security procedures that are related to SNMP
   in general but are not specific to this MIB module need to be
   implemented by concerned operators.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection opens devices to attack.  The
   following tables and objects are sensitive/vulnerable because
   unauthorized modification would allow an attacker to elevate or
   degrade a device's capabilities:

   o  From the Device Information MIB: cSystemDate,
      cSystemInitialLoadParameters, cSecurityLevel, cResetDevice,
      cSanitizeDevice, cRenderInoperable, cDeviceComponentOpStatus,
      cDeviceComponentDescription, cBatteryLowThreshold,
      cFirmwareRunning, and cFirmwareRowStatus,

   o  From the Key Management Information MIB: cZeroizeAllKeys,
      cZeroizeSymmetricKeyTable, cZeroizeAsymKeyTable,
      cZeroizeTrustAnchorTable, cZeroizeCDMStoreTable,

      cAsymKeyGlobalExpiryWarning, cGenerateKeyType, cGenerateKey,
      cSymKeyUsage, cSymKeyID, cSymKeyIssuer, cSymKeyEffectiveDate,
      cSymKeyExpirationDate, cSymKeyExpiryWarning,

      cCDMLDeliveryRequest, cCDMServerURI, cCDMServerAdditionalInfo,
      cCDMServerRowStatus, cCDMAdditionalInfo, cCDMDeliveryPriority,
      cCDMDeliveryRequest, and cCDMDeliveryRowStatus.

   o  From the Key Transfer Push MIB: cCDMTransferDelay,
      cCDMTransferMaxAttempts, cCDMPushDestTransferType,
      cCDMPushDestAddressLocationType, cCDMPushDestAddressLocation,
      cCDMPushDestTransferTime, cCDMPushDestPackageSelection,
      cCDMPushDestRowStatus, cCDMTransferPkgLocatorRowPtr,
      cCDMTransferPkgRowStatus, cCDMPushSrcTransferType,
      cCDMPushSrcAddrLocationType, cCDMPushSrcAddrLocation, and
      cCDMPushSrcRowStatus.

   o  From the Security Policy Information MIB:
      cSecPolicyRuleDescription, cSecPolicyRuleType,
      cSecPolicyRuleFilterReference, cSecPolicyRuleAction, and
      cSecPolicyRuleRowStatus.

   o  From the Security Connection Information MIB: cSecConType,
      cSecConDataPlaneID, cSecConDirection, cSecConKeyReference,
      cSecConCryptographicSuite, cSecConEstablishmentTime,
      cSecConStatus, cSecConRowStatus, and cSecConRemoteKeyReference.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  The following tables and objects are
   sensitive/vulnerable because unauthorized access would disclose
   device configuration information:

   o  From the Device Information MIB: cSystemUpTime,
      cElectronicSerialNumber, cLastChanged, cVendorName,
      cModelIdentifier, cHardwareVersionNumber,

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
