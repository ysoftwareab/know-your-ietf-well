Internet-Draft           iCalendar XML Guideline                May 2005


1.  Introduction

   The Extended Markup Language (XML) as defined in [XML] has gained
   widespread attention as a "web friendly" syntax for representing and
   exchanging documents	and data on the Internet.  This interest
   includes requests for and discussion of possible document type
   definitions (DTD) and name-spaces for IETF standard	formats such as
   that defined by [RFC 2445], [RCF 2446], and [RFC 2447].

   This memo defines how XML can be used to represent iCalendar
   objects,and how iCalendar namespaces can be used with other XML
   documents.  An example DTD is provided although use of a DTD is not
   required.

   This memo does not try to enforce any specific one-to-one mapping
   between XML	objects and iCalendar objects, but instead attempts to
   document the method whereby XML developers can provide
   interoperability with iCalendar.

   NOTE: The [RFC 2445] is the definitive reference for the definition
   of iCalendar semantics.  This memo only provides a guideline for
   representing such semantics in XML.  This memo does not introduce any
   new semantics for items already defined by [RFC 2445].  [RFC 2446],
   [RFC 2447], and [CAP] are the references for protocols	for the
   exchange of iCalendar objects.  This memo does not introduce any new
   protocols or functions beyond those in the respective documents.

   An attempt has been made to guide the developer in use of XML to
   represent iCalendar semantics, allowing XML-based applications to
   make use of the iCalendar [RFC2445] and related protocols [RFC2446],
   [RFC2447], and [CAP] semantics and to provide interoperability
   between XML-based applications and iCalendar-compliant	applications.

   The publication of XML version 1.0 was followed by publication of two
   World-wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendations relevant to this
   memo.  The first was a recommendation on "Namespaces in XML" and the
   other was a recommendation on "Extensible Stylesheet Language" and
   "Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation" (XSL and XSLT).  An
   XML name-space is a collection of names, identified by a URI.  An XSL
   transformation(XSLT)is a document in the Extensible Stylesheet
   Language (XSL) which provides a method for transforming an XML
   document into some other form.  In anticipation of the use of XML
   namespaces, this memo includes the definition of URIs to be used to
   identify the namespaces for iCalendar [RFC 2445], iTIP [RFC 2446],
   iMIP [RFC 2447] and CAP elements.  XML applications that conform to
   this memo and also use namespaces MAY include other	non-iCalendar
   namespaces.

   Documents MAY include a Document Type Definition (DTD), an XML
   schema, or may	reference external versions of either.  This memo
   allows documents containing	iCalendar XML objects to be constructed
   with either.  DTDs and Schemas are outside	the scope of this memo.  A
   document containing a DTD or schema MAY include	definitions for
   calendar elements.  Any document conforming to this memo MUST	provide
   an XSL transformation which will render those calendar elements
   into	standard iCalendar/iTIP/iMIP/CAP (as appropriate) elements.

2.  Using XML For Representing iCalendar

   XML is a simplified version of the text markup syntax defined by ISO
   8879, Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).  XML was published
   as a proposed recommendation [XML] by the World-wide Web Consortium
   (W3C) on February 10, 1998.

3.  XML and XSL Dependencies

   This memo specifies the XML representation for the standard iCalendar
   elements defined by [RFC 2445], [RFC 2446], [RFC2447], and [CAP].
   There are no XML dependencies other than the [XML] and the [XMLNS]
   recommendations.

   This memo requires that conforming documents include a reference to
   an [XSL] stylesheet for transforming the document into standard
   iCalendar format.  How the transformation is done is left to the
   implementor.  Providing an XSL transform into iCalendar objects does
   not preclude providing other transforms.

4.  Working With Standard and XML iCalendar Representations

   This memo provides a guideline for using alternative, XML
   representations for the standard iCalendar elements defined in [RFC
   2445].  These alternative representations SHOULD provide the same
   semantics as that defined in the standard format.  It is the goal of
   this memo to allow all [RFC 2445] extensions and modifications to be
   translated into and from this XML format.

5.  Conversion

   This memo requires any compliant document to be transformable into
   standard iCalendar information.  It is recognized that such
   conversion MAY be asymmetric,	since compliant documents MAY include
   information which is not representable in iCalendar and which would
   be lost during any "round trip" conversions.  This does not preclude
   implementation of "round-trippable" transformations, but they are not
   required.

   To formalize and standardize the interchange of iCalendar information
   through	XML, each conforming document MUST include reference to an
   XSL stylesheet which can transform the document into a standard
   iCalendar [RFC 2445] document of MIME	content-type "text/calendar".

6.  Mixed Use of Both Representations

   As previously indicated, conversion between the XML and standard
   representations of iCalendar is a straightforward process using XSL
   transformations.  In addition, mixed use of both representations is
   also possible using MIME objects.

   While MIME multipart content-types can be used to provide a mix of
   both the standard and XML representations, this is NOT required.
   Instead, each document MUST include a reference to an XSL stylesheet
   which can transform the XML representation into standard iCalendar
   (and possibly, iTIP, iMIP, or CAP) syntax.

   With the use of the MIME multipart content-types, compound MIME
   entities containing a mix of the standard and XML representations can
   be specified.  Internet applications conforming to this memo MAY send
   both the standard and XML representation of the iCalendar objects, to
   provide compatibility with Internet applications which cannot process
   the required XSL transformation.

7.  Using Data Types

   Strong "data typing" is an integral design principle to the iCalendar
   format.	Strong data typing in iCalendar means that the format type
   for each property	value is well known.  Within [RFC 2445], the data
   type is called the "value type".  The standard format defined by [RFC
   2445] specifies a default value type for each calendar and component
   property.  In addition, many of the property definitions allow for
   the specification of alternate value types.  The required XSL
   transformation in this memo MUST create iCalendar elements with
   proper types.  Consult iCalendar [RFC 2445] for documentation of
   value types.

Internet-Draft           iCalendar XML Guideline                May 2005


8.  Namespaces

   [XMLNS] defines "Namespaces in XML" to be a collection of names,
   identified by a URI, which are used in XML documents as element types
   and attribute names.  The [XML] specification does not include a
   definition for namespaces, but does set down some guidelines for
   experimental naming of namespaces.

   XML namespaces allow multiple markup vocabulary in a single document.
   Documents	and applications conforming to this memo MAY use multiple
   namespaces with the	iCalendar, iTIP, iMIP, and CAP namespaces.
   Multiple namespaces MUST be used for the different iCalendar and
   protocol elements.  This requirement is intended to provide clarity
   in the document, by discriminating calendar object elements
   from	protocol elements.

   The document at the namespace URI does not contain any defintions but
   serves as a unique identifier to allow specification of different
   namespaces.  Applications complying with this memo MUST use the
   following URIs for namespace elements:

      iCalendar:	http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt

      iTIP:		http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2446.txt

      iMIP:		http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2447.txt

      CAP:		http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/
      draft-ietf-calsch-cap-13.txt

   NOTE: the URI for CAP will be replaced with the RFCxxxx reference
   when CAP is	completed.

   The following is an example of a well-formed but invalid "xdoc"
   document type	that includes elements and attribute lists from the
   iCalendar and iTIP	namespaces.

                   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
                   <xdoc>
                     <iCal:vcalendar iTIP:method="publish"
                             xmlns:iCal="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/RFC2445.txt"
                             xmlns:iTIP="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/RFC2446.txt">
                     <iCal:vevent>
                     <!--- VEVENT elements go here -->
                     </iCal:vevent>

                     <!-- Remainder of the XML document, each element from the -->
                     <!-- iCalendar namespace with the "iCal:" prefix. -->

                   </xdoc>

   The semantics of the "xmlns" attribute, and any attribute with
   "xmlns:" as a 	prefix, is as specified in [XMLNS].  It is used to
   declare a namespace in XML.

   iCalendar provides for "experimental" elements.  These elements are
   represented in iCalendar with element names beginning with "X-".  Any
   experimental element in a	document which conforms to this memo MUST
   be represented by a namespace different than those used for
   iCalendar, iTIP, iMIP, or CAP.  This requirement is intended to
   simplify implementation of extensions and experimental items.

9.  Emailing documents with iCalendar XML Representation

   It is expected that iCalendar XML documents will need to be sent over
   SMTP/MIME email.  The "text/xml" and "application/xml" content-types
   have been registered for XML documents.

   All documents conforming to this memo SHOULD be sent as content-type
   "text/xml" or "application/xml".  When iCalendar elements may be
   mixed with others, it is not	practical for an MUA to determine,
   without opening the document, if iCalendar XML elements exist within
   the document.

   If a part of a MIME multi-part message contains only XML-represented
   iCalendar objects, and it is wished to provide the ability for an
   application to determine content based upon the MIME headers, the
   content-types "text/xml+calendar" or	"application/xml+calendar" MAY
   be used.

   Internet applications conforming to this memo MUST include in any
   iCalendar XML document that is sent, the XSL stylesheet reference to
   be used to provide transformation from the XML representation to the
   standard representation.  This	restriction guarantees that a standard
   iCalendar object can be produced from the iCalendar XML document.

   Internet applications conforming to this memo MAY send the iCalendar
   XML document in a "multipart/alternative" MIME entity that also
   contains an equivalent iCalendar object in the standard format
   defined by [RFC 2445], to provide compatibility with applications
   which cannot process XML or XSL transformations.

   An XML application comforming to the guidelines in this memo MUST be
   able to receive and properly process the "application/xml" document
   contained within a	"multipart" message content-type, and MUST be
   capable of performing the XSL transformation of the iCalendar
   elements of the document into a standard iCalendar document.

10.  iCalendar XML Representation and File Systems

   The iCalendar XML documents will be stored in file systems.  The
   accepted practice for file extensions for XML documents is the text
   "XML".  However, IF a document	contains only XML representations of
   iCalendar data, then for file association with applications that can
   directly process this document type, it is RECOMMENDED	that the file
   extension be the text "xcs".

11.  Example Usage

   The following sections provide various examples of documents using
   iCalendar elements in XML.

11.1  Example DTD

   The following is a DTD which can be used to represent iCalendar [RFC
   2445] objects.  While this DTD represents the iCalendar objects as
   currently defined, this document does not imply that this is the only
   way to represent them, nor that this is the best DTD to do so.  This
   is provided as an example, only.

   convert an xCalendar document into an iCalendar [RFC 2445] text
   object.  Again, this is an 	example and not presented as the only or
   best way to accomplish the 	transformation.

   The following is a simple example of a iCalendar XML document.  This
   document is both a well-formed and valid XML document.  It also
   contains the required reference to the XSL transformation.  The
   iCalendar object specifies an appointment.

12.  Acknowledgments

   This document is based on previous work by Frank Dawson, Eric R.
   Plamondon, Doug Royer, and Surendra K. Reddy, whose previous XML-
   iCalendar work provided the basis for this document.  Their previous
   xCalendar work also acknowledged the contributions of Greg
   FitzPatrick, Charles Goldfarb, Paul Hoffman, Lisa Dusseault and
   Thomas Rowe.  The rdf2ical.xsl transformation created by Masahide
   Kanzaki provided inspiration and concepts for the XSL transformation
   in this document.  The primary author of this version of the document
   (T. Hare), however, assumes responsibility for all content,
   omissions, and especially errors.

13.  Security Considerations

   CDATA Sections - - A XML iCalendar document may contain CDATA
   sections to represent content for specific element types.  The CDATA
   section specifies arbitrary character data that is not meant to be
   interpreted.  It is not scanned	by the XML parser for markup.  While
   this memo restricts that any CDATA section MUST NOT contain markup or
   other such alternate representation for the property value, in
   general, CDATA section from a non-conformant implementation can
   contain content such as HTML markup.  HTML text can be used to invoke
   programs.	Implementors should be aware that this may leave an
   implementation open to malicious attack that might occur as a result
   of executing the markup in the CDATA section.

   PROCEDURAL ALARMS - - A XML iCalendar document can be created that
   contains a "VEVENT" and "VTODO" calendar component with "VALARM"
   calendar components.  The "VALARM" calendar component can be of type
   PROCEDURE and can have an attachment containing some sort of
   executable program.  Implementations that incorporate these types of
   alarms are subject to any virus or malicious attack that might occur
   as a result of executing the attachment.

   ATTACHMENTS - - A XML iCalendar document can include references to
   Uniform Resource Locators that can be programmed resources.
   Implementers and users of this memo should be aware of the network
   security implications of accepting and	parsing such information.

   In addition, since the XML objects in this memo may be exchanged via
   many possible mechanisms, the security considerations observed by
   implementations of those mechanisms should be followed for this memo.
