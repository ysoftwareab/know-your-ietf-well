2. Abstract

   This draft considers the optical network service model referred
   to as the "domain services" model [1]. Under this model, the optical
   network provides a set of well-defined services to clients (IP and
   others). The signaling and routing interface between the client and
   optical networks is referred to as the User-Network Interface (UNI).
   This draft describes the services provided over the UNI, and the
   requirements on any signaling protocol used to invoke the services.

   This draft reflects ongoing work at the Optical Interworking Forum
   (OIF) on the optical UNI (similar work is being carried out by the
   Optical Domain Services Interconnect (ODSI) coalition [2]). The
   relevance of this draft to the IETF is two-fold.  First, for the
   signaling portion of the optical UNI, extensions of two MPLS
   signaling protocols are presently under consideration in the OIF:
   RSVP with TE extensions and LDP. The objective of this draft is to
   guide the adaptation of these protocols for UNI signaling. Second,
   to harmonize the signaling of UNI originated lightpath requests and
   peer model lightpath establishment mechanisms [1], alignment between
   OIF and IETF lightpath parameters and signaling functionality is
   desirable. This draft aims to serve this purpose. The content of
   this draft is expected to evolve as work progresses on the optical
   UNI.

3. Introduction

   The network model considered in this draft consists of client
   networks (IP and others) attached to an optical core network, and
   connected to their peers over dynamically established switched
   lightpaths. The optical core itself is assumed to be incapable of
   processing individual IP packets.

   The optical network is assumed to consist of multiple optical
   sub-networks interconnected by optical links in a general topology
   (referred to as an optical mesh network). This network may be multi-
   vendor. Each sub-network itself contains a mesh-connected set of
   optical cross-connects (OXCs). This network model is shown in Figure
   1.

   There are two logical control interfaces identified in Figure 1.
   These are the client-optical network interface, and the optical sub-
   network interface. These interfaces are also referred to as the
   User-Network Interface (UNI) and the Network-Network Interface
   (NNI). In this draft, the focus is on the UNI.

   The physical control structure used to realize the logical UNI may
   vary. For instance, some of the possibilities are:

   1. Direct Interface: An in-band or out-of-band IP control channel
      (IPCC) may be implemented between a client and each OXC that it
      connects to. With in-band signaling, the signaling messages are
      carried over a logical communication channel embedded in a
      physical optical link between the client device and OXC. For
      example, this could be the overhead bytes in the SONET frame or a
      dedicated optical wavelength. With out-of-band signaling, the
      signaling messages are transmitted over a separate communication
      infrastructure that is independent of the optical data links
      between the client devices and OXC. For example, this could be a
      LAN/WAN based network infrastructure separate from the optical
      network.

     This control channel, in-band or out-of-band, is used for
     exchanging signaling and routing messages directly between the
     client and the OXC. With a direct interface, the client and the
     OXC it connects to support the control plane information exchange.
     This is shown in Figure 2.

                         Figure 2: Direct Interface



   2. Indirect interface: An out-of-band IP control channel may be
      implemented between the client and a controlling device in the
      optical network to signal service requests and responses. For
      instance, a control plane server in the optical network may
      receive service requests from clients. Similarly, out-of-band
      signaling may be used between a device in the client network
      (e.g., a management system) and the OXC, or between devices in
      client and optical networks to signal service requests. In these
      cases, there is no direct control interaction between clients and
      respective OXCs. One reason to have an indirect interface would be
      that the OXCs and/or clients do not support a direct interface.

   It is essential that both direct and indirect interfaces be
   supported by any UNI signaling protocol. Under both these
   interfaces, the entity that performs UNI signaling on the client
   side is referred to as UNI-C. The corresponding entity on the
   network side is referred to as UNI-N. In the case of the direct
   interface, each client device attached to the optical network will
   have a UNI-C instance and each OXC attached to a client will have a
   UNI-N instance. In the case of the indirect interface, these
   entities may be located outside of the client device and OXC, as per
   the description in (2) above.

   In the following, the service definition and signaling requirements
   for realizing the UNI are described.

4. Optical Network Services

   The optical network primarily offers discrete capacity, high
   bandwidth connectivity in the form of lightpaths. A lightpath is
   established between two termination points in the optical network,
   to which client devices are attached. The properties of the
   lightpaths are defined by the attributes specified during lightpath
   establishment or via acceptable modification requests.

   The notion of "user groups" are considered as integral to lightpath
   establishment in this draft. A user group defines a community of
   client devices with restrictions on connectivity from devices
   outside this group. The requirements on lightpath termination point
   and user group identification are described in the next section.

   The following actions support lightpath services:

   1. Lightpath creation: This action allows a lightpath with the
      specified attributes to be created between a pair of termination
      points. Each lightpath is assigned a unique identifier by the
      optical network, called the lightpath ID, which is used in UNI
      signaling messages to reference the lightpath in further
     transactions. Lightpath creation may be subject to network-
     defined policies (e.g., user group connectivity restrictions) and
     security procedures.

   2. Lightpath deletion: This action allows an existing lightpath
      (referenced by its ID) to be deleted.

   3. Lightpath modification: This action allows certain parameters of
      the lightpath (referenced by its ID) to be modified. Lightpath
     modification may be subject to network-defined policies. Lightpath
     modification must be non-destructive, i.e., the success or failure
     of the modification procedure must not result in the loss of the
     original lightpath.

   4. Lightpath status enquiry: This service allows the status of
      certain parameters of the lightpath (referenced by its ID) to be
      queried.

   Additionally, the following address resolution procedures may be
   made available over the UNI (more sophisticated routing information
   exchange over the UNI is covered in [3]):

   1. Client Registration: This allows a client to register its
      address(es) and user group identifier(s) with the optical
      network. The registered address may be of different types, IP,
      ATM NSAP, E.164, etc. The optical network associates the client
      address and user group ID with an optical-network-administered
      address.

                          Expires on 5/24/01              Page 5 of 16

             draft-bala-mpls-optical-uni-signaling-01.txt



   2. Client De-Registration: This allows a client to withdraw its
      address(es) and user group identifier(s) from the optical
      network.

   3. Query: This allows a client to supply another clientÆs native
      address (e.g., ATM) and user group ID, and get back an optical-
      network-administered address that can be used in lightpath create
      messages.

   An end-system discovery procedure may be used over the UNI to verify
   local port connectivity between the optical and client devices, and
   allows each device to bootstrap the UNI control channel. Finally, a
   "service discovery" procedure may be employed as a precursor to
   obtaining UNI services. Service discovery allows a client to
   determine the static parameters of the interconnection with the
   optical network, including the UNI signaling protocols supported.
   The protocols for neighbor and service discovery are different from
   the UNI signaling protocol itself (for example, see LMP [6]).

   With regard to address resolution, the registration and de-
   registration procedures may be implemented using service discovery
   mechanisms. The query mechanism may be implemented as an additional
   UNI signaling procedure.


5. Identification of Lightpath Termination Points and User Groups

   It is assumed that each OXC in an optical network has one or more IP
   addresses assigned to it. The address assigned to an OXC is assumed
   to be unique within the service domain that supports the UNI. These
   addresses are referred to as optical-network-administered addresses.
   A client point of attachment to the optical network is associated
   with an optical-network-administered address. It is possible that
   more than one point of attachment may be associated with the same
   optical-network-administered address. Lightpath creation messages
   must identify the source and destination client points of
   termination. If these termination points cannot be uniquely
   identified by an IP address alone, another address component, called
   the "logical port ID" may optionally be specified. Thus, the full
   client termination point identification consists of two components,
   an IP address and an optional logical port ID. The logical port ID
   consists of the physical port, and channel and sub-channel
   identifiers unique to a specific OXC (that can be reached using the
   IP address component). Because the logical port ID is of local
   significance only, it must be unique only with respect to a specific
   OXC. Furthermore, the logical port ID is not used for routing a
   lightpath within the optical network, but only to identify a
   termination point within an OXC.

   It is required that every client be assigned one or more user group
   identifiers. User group identification allows the formation of
   closed user groups, or virtual private networks of clients. The user

             draft-bala-mpls-optical-uni-signaling-01.txt


   group identifier(s) for each client-optical interface is registered
   during UNI service discovery. The format of the user group
   identifier is the same as the VPN identifier defined in [4].

6. Signaling Requirements

   This section describes the mechanisms that must be available in a
   UNI signaling protocol.

6.1 IP Control Channel

   An IP control channel is required between the UNI-C and the
   corresponding UNI-N entities.  To implement the control channel, it
   is necessary for the UNI-C and the UNI-N entities to know each
   other's IP address. In the case of the direct interface, the UNI
   neighbor discovery protocol is used for this. The same protocol
   would allow the optical network to identify the client and apply any
   policies that may relate to the establishment of the UNI control
   channel. In the case of the indirect interface, the IP address
   information must be configured administratively.

   An in-band or an out-of-band transport link should exist between
   UNI-C and UNI-N to establish the control channel. To use such a link
   for the UNI control channel, the following requirements must
   be met:

   o The link must be able to carry IP packets from UNI-C to UNI-N;

   o The bit rate and minimum transfer size (in bytes) of the link must
     be adequate to support this function;

   o The link must be secure, or UNI-C and UNI-N must implement
     procedures to recognize authorized messages and to prevent
     unauthorized access;

   o It must be possible for both UNI-C and UNI-N to detect the failure
      of the link quickly.

   In the case of direct interface, there could be multiple interfaces
   between the client and the OXC. In this case, there need be only a
   single active IP control channel between them. This control channel
   can utilize any one of the many in-band and/or out-of-band transport
   links between the devices. Furthermore, as long as there is at least
   one link available, the UNI control channel must be maintained
   without break.

   The UNI-C and UNI-N entities must be able to determine quickly the
   failure of an already established UNI control channel. The failure
   of the control channel or the unreachability of the peer UNI
   signaling entity does not imply the removal of established
   lightpaths. On the other hand, since signaling can be initiated
   from either side of the lightpath for lightpath deletion or
   modification of certain parameters, it is possible for the

   client sides when the UNI control channel is not functional.
   Thus, when the UNI control channel is affected by a failure (e.g.,
   the failure of the transport link or the unreachability of the
   peer UNI signaling module), a procedure to synchronize lightpath
   state must be implemented after recovery.

6.2 UNI Signaling (Abstract) Messages

   The UNI signaling messages that must be supported are described
   below. These messages are denoted "abstract", in reference to
   the fact that they may be realized in different ways depending on
   the signaling protocol used. In the following description, the terms
   "initiating UNI-C" and "terminating UNI-C" are used to identify the
   entities at two ends of a lightpath that initiate and terminate
   signaling actions. With the direct interface, a UNI-C entity at
   either end of a lightpath can initiate a signaling action. The UNI-C
   entity at the other end then becomes the terminating client. With
   some indirect interfaces, the initiating and terminating UNI-C could
   be the same entity.

   1. Lightpath Create Request: Sent from the initiating UNI-C to UNI-N
      to create a lightpath.

   2. Lightpath Create Response: Sent from

      a. the terminating UNI-C to UNI-N to accept an incoming lightpath
         create request.

      b. the UNI-N to the initiating UNI-C to indicate the successful
         creation of (or failure to create) the lightpath as requested
         in (1).

   3. Lightpath Delete Request: Sent from

      a. the initiating UNI-C to UNI-N to delete a lightpath.

      b. the UNI-N to a UNI-C to indicate the deletion of a lightpath
         by the network.

   4. Lightpath Delete Response: Sent from

      a. the terminating UNI-C to UNI-N to acknowledge an incoming
         lightpath delete request.

      b. the UNI-N to the initiating UNI-C to indicate the successful
         deletion of the lightpath as requested in (3).

   5. Lightpath Modification Request: Sent from the initiating UNI-C to
      UNI-N to modify the specified lightpath parameters. Modification
      must be non-destructive.

   6. Lightpath Modification Response: Sent from UNI-N to the

      initiating UNI-C to indicate the successful modification of (or
      failure to modify) the lightpath parameters requested in (5).

   7. Lightpath Status Enquiry: Sent from

      a. the initiating UNI-C to UNI-N to enquire about the status
         and/or the parameters of the specified lightpath, or all
         lightpaths owned by the UNI-C.

      b. the UNI-N to either UNI-C to enquire about the status of
         the parameters of the specified lightpath, or all lightpaths
         owned by the UNI-C.

   8. Lightpath Status Response: Sent from the UNI-N to the initiating
      UNI-C to indicate the status of lightpath parameters as requested
      in (7). Multiple "Lightpath Status Response" messages (one per
      lightpath) may be sent by UNI-N when the initiating UNI-C requests
      the status of all lightpaths terminating at a particular
      interface.

   9. Notification: This message is sent autonomously by UNI-N to UNI-C
      to indicate a change in the status of the lightpath (e.g.,
      unrestorable lightpath failure).

  10. Address Query: This message is sent from the UNI-C to the
      corresponding UNI-N to request the resolution of a remote client
      network address to the corresponding optical-network-administered
      IP address (and logical port ID, if assigned). The following
      client network address types may be supported: IPv4, IPv6, ATM
      NSAP, E.164, and British Standards Institute ICD AESA.

   How these messages are mapped to actions within the optical network,
   and the signaling protocol used within the optical network to
   realize the actions are not concerns at the UNI. Furthermore, the
   resolution of conflicts when UNI signaling is concurrently invoked
   on both sides of a lightpath to perform certain actions (e.g.,
   modify with conflicting parameters) is not considered to be a UNI
   signaling issue.

6.3 UNI (Abstract) Message Parameters

   The following parameters must be encoded in UNI signaling messages.
   It is expected that formats for the parameters will be reconciled
   with the format of similar parameters being developed for GMPLS
   signaling [5]. The list below may evolve based on ongoing work in
   OIF UNI signaling.

6.3.1  Identification

   1. Lightpath ID: A network-wide unique 64-bit identifier for a
      lightpath. This identifier is assigned by the optical network.



                          Expires on 5/24/01              Page 9 of 16

             draft-bala-mpls-optical-uni-signaling-01.txt


   2. Contract ID: A carrier-assigned identification that identifies
      the service contract. This is part of the policy data carried
      from the client to the network. The contract ID is a variable
      length string passed from the client to the network.

   3. Source/destination client point of attachment: This has two
      components, an optical-network-administered IP address and an
      optional logical port information. The latter consists of a port
      index, a channel index and a sub-channel index.

   4. User group ID: VPN identifier as defined in [4].

   5. UNI-C ID: IP address of the UNI-C entity.

6.3.2  Service-Related

   1. Directionality: Flag that indicates whether the lightpath is uni
      or bi-directional.  Default is bi-directional.

   2. Framing type: Framing type specifies the format of the signal to
      be transported across the UNI.  The valid framing options
      considered are SONET and SDH.

   3. Overhead termination type: This attribute is framing specific. For
      SONET and SDH framing this field specifies to what degree the
      framing overhead bytes are terminated. The following values are to
      be supported for UNI:


          o  signal without termination of any overhead;


          o: signal with the possible termination of section overhead;


          o: signal with the possible termination of section and line

          overhead.


   3. Bandwidth: This specifies the bandwidth of the service and is
      interpreted w.r.t. the framing.  Note that this is the bandwidth
      of the service, not the bandwidth of the physical interfaces.
      The latter may differ on each end of the connection.


         o  For SONET, the options are STS-1, STS-2,..., STS-768

         o  For SDH, the options are STM-1, STM-2, ... STM-256


      It is part of the connection acceptance process of the optical
      network to determine if the network and the physical interfaces at
      the UNI can support the requested framing type, overhead
      termination type and bandwidth.

             draft-bala-mpls-optical-uni-signaling-01.txt


   4. Propagation delay: This specifies the maximum acceptable
      propagation delay in milliseconds.  Defaults to infinity.

   5. Service level:  An integer specifying the service level
      requested for the lightpath. Different service levels may be
      defined by the optical network service provider, encompassing
      priority, preemption, protection and other service-distinguishing
      parameters. The "service level" parameter encodes the service
      type and it is interpreted by the provider. Some values (e.g.,
      0-255) should be reserved for future use.  The remaining values
      are provider specific. Default set by provider.

      It is also possible that priority, preemption, etc., could be
      separately specified as (optional) parameters.


6.3.3  Routing-related

   1. Diversity: A list of n lightpaths (indicated by their IDs) from
      which the present lightpath must be physically diverse in the
      network. For each lightpath ID it may specified whether the
      diversity desired is link, node or SRLG [1] disjoint. All the
      specified lightpaths must originate from the same source OXC that
      the present lightpath is being established.

6.3.4  Miscellaneous

   1.  Result Code: A code indicating success or failure of certain
       operations. For example, a lightpath create request could result
       in success or failure. This code may indicate the result as well
       as the reason for failure.

   2.  Status: A code that indicates the status of a lightpath in the
       "Lightpath Status Response" message.

6.3.5  Security-related

   It is assumed that the security features provided by individual
   signaling protocols (RSVP/LDP) will be used as appropriate.

6.3.6  Policy, accounting and authorization related

   A container for policy-related attributes must be available in
   signaling protocols (e.g., RSVP policy data object). Presently,
   contract ID is recognized as a policy parameter. Other parameters
   are TBD.

6.4 Contents of UNI Abstract Messages

    The message contents described below may evolve based on ongoing
    work, and on the development of security, policy, accounting and
    other parameters.

7. Summary and Conclusion

   This draft described the domain services model and the signaling
   requirements at the client-optical interface, called the UNI. The
   objective of this draft are two-fold: to guide the adaptation of
   RSVP-TE/LDP for UNI signaling and to harmonize the signaling mechanisms
   and parameter encoding under UNI signaling with GMPLS signaling [5]. 
   This draft reflects the ongoing work at the OIF, and the contents are 
   expected to evolve as work progresses on UNI signaling.
