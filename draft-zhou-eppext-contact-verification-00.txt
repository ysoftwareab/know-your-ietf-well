1.  Introduction

   The verification of domain name and registrant identity are required
   in some registries according to local laws and regulations.  The
   registry should ensure the domain registered does not contain any
   illegal words and the registrants should pass the real-name
   verification.

   This document describes an extension mapping for version 1.0 of the
   Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) [RFC5730].  This mapping, an
   extension to EPP object mappings like the EPP contact mapping
   [RFC5733], can be used to retrieve verification information in query
   commands.

   This document is specified using the XML 1.0 as described in
   [W3C.REC-xml-20040204] and XML Schema notation as described in
   [W3C.REC-xmlschema-1-20041028] and [W3C.REC-xmlschema-2-20041028].

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   In examples, "C:" represents lines sent by a protocol client and "S:"
   represents lines returned by a protocol server.  Indentation and
   white space in examples are provided only to illustrate element
   relationships and are not a REQUIRED feature of this specification.

   XML is case sensitive.  Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications
   and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the
   character case presented to develop a conforming implementation.

   vericontact-1.0 in this document is used as an abbreviation for
   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:vericontact-1.0.

3.  Object Attributes

   This extension adds additional elements to the EPP contact mapping
   [RFC5733].  Only the new elements are described here.

3.1.  Distinction Type Values

   A contact may be verified already and may have something like
   integrity records.  So a distiction type values are defined to
   associate with a contact object.  Distinction type value
   descriptions:

   o  verified.  A contact has been verified already.

   o  blocked.  A contact has blemished integrity records.

   o  unverified.  A contact has not pass the verification process.

3.2.  Verification Status Values

   The contact object MUST always have one associated verification
   status value.  The verification status value can be set only by the
   server.  The verification status of an object MAY change as a result
   of an action performed by a server operator.  Verification status
   Value descriptions:

   o  unverified.  No verification materials are received.

   o  pendingVerify.  Verification action has not been completed by the
      server after receiving verification materials.  Server operators
      can delay action completion for a variety of reasons, such as to
      allow for human review or third-party action.

   o  pass.  Successful verification.

   o  failed.  Failed verification.  Further verification materials may
      be needed.

3.3.  Dates and Times

   Date and time attribute values MUST be represented in Universal
   Coordinated Time (UTC) using the Gregorian calendar.  The extended
   date-time form using upper case "T" and "Z" characters defined in
   [W3C.REC-xmlschema-2-20041028] MUST be used to represent date-time
   values, as XML Schema does not support truncated date-time forms or
   lower case "T" and "Z" characters.

3.4.  Client Identifier

   The client identifier represents the unique identifier assigned to
   the client by the server.

4.  Verification State Diagram

   Following is a general verification state transition process:

   1.  The initial verification status of a domain is "unverified".

   2.  The registrant submits the proof materials to the registry.

   3.  After receiving the proof materials, the verification status of
   the domain is changed to "pendingVerify".

   4.  The proof materials pass the human review or third-party
   verification.

   5.  The verification status is changed to "pass".

   6.  The proof materials are not approved.

   7.  The verification status is changed to "failed".

   8.  If the registrant resubmits the proof materials, the status will
   be set to "pendingVerify" again.

5.  EPP Command Mapping

   A detailed description of the EPP syntax and semantics can be found
   in the EPP core protocol specification [RFC5730].  The command
   mappings described here are specifically for use in provisioning and
   managing verification information via EPP.

5.1.  EPP Query Commands

   EPP provides three commands to retrieve contact information: <check>
   to determine if a contact object can be provisioned within a
   repository, <info> to retrieve detailed information associated with a
   contact object, and <transfer> to retrieve contact-object transfer
   status information.

5.1.1.  EPP <check> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <check> command
   described in the EPP contact mapping [RFC5733].  However, additional
   elements are defined for the <check> response.

   Example <check> command:


   C:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
   C:<epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
   C:  <command>
   C:    <check>
   C:      <contact:check
   C:       xmlns:contact="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:contact-1.0">
   C:        <contact:id>sh8013</contact:id>
   C:        <contact:id>sah8013</contact:id>
   C:        <contact:id>8013sah</contact:id>
   C:      </contact:check>
   C:    </check>
   C:    <clTRID>ABC-12345</clTRID>
   C:  </command>
   C:</epp>


   When an <check> command has been processed successfully, the EPP
   <resData> element MUST contain child elements as described in the EPP
   contact mapping [RFC5733].  In addition, the EPP <extension> element
   SHOULD contain a child <vericontact:chkData> element that identifies
   the extension namespace if the contact object has data associated
   with this extension and based on its service policy.  The
   <vericontact:chkData> element contains the following child elements:

   o  An OPTIONAL <vericontact:distinction> element is designed to
      indicate the verification status of a contact information with
      respect to the verification rules of a specific registry.  The
      <vericontact:distinction> element is only used for a <contact:id>
      element with the attribute "avail" that equals false.  The element
      contains the following attributes:

      *  A "id" attribute associates with a specific contact identifier
         checked.

      *  A "type" attribute specifies whether a contact is verified or
         not as described in section 3.1.

   Example <check> response:


S:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
S:<epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
S:  <response>
S:    <result code="1000">

5.1.2.  EPP <info> Command

   This extension does not add any element to the EPP <info> command
   described in the EPP contact mapping [RFC5733].  However, additional
   elements are defined for the <info> response.

   Example <info> command:


   C:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
   C:<epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
   C:  <command>
   C:    <info>
   C:      <contact:info
   C:       xmlns:contact="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:contact-1.0">
   C:        <contact:id>sh8013</contact:id>
   C:        <contact:authInfo>
   C:          <contact:pw>2fooBAR</contact:pw>
   C:        </contact:authInfo>
   C:      </contact:info>
   C:    </info>
   C:    <clTRID>ABC-12345</clTRID>
   C:  </command>
   C:</epp>


   When an <info> command has been processed successfully, the EPP
   <resData> element MUST contain child elements as described in the EPP
   contact mapping [RFC5733].  In addition, the EPP <extension> element
   SHOULD contain a child <vericontact:infData> element that identifies
   the extension namespace if the contact object has data associated
   with this extension and based on its service policy.  The
   <vericontact:infData> element contains the following child elements:

   o  A <vericontact:status> element that contains the current
      verification status defined in section 3.2.

   o  An OPTIONAL <vericontact:history> element that contains records
      with history verification process information.  The
      <vericontact:history> element MUST contain following elements:

      *  <vericontact:record> element contains a single history record
         for the verification process.  The <vericontact:record> element
         MUST contain following elements:

         +  A <vericontact:date> element contains the date and time when
            the operation has been executed.

         +  A <vericontact:op> element contains the name of an operation
            that has been executed.

         +  A <vericontact:clID> element contains the identifier of an
            sponsoring client.

   <info> response for the unauthorized client has not been changed, see
   [RFC5733] for detail.

   An EPP error response MUST be returned if an <info> command cannot be
   processed for any reason.

5.1.3.  EPP <transfer> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <transfer>
   command or <transfer> response described in the EPP contact mapping
   [RFC5733].

5.2.  EPP Transform Commands

   EPP provides five commands to transform domain objects: <create> to
   create an instance of a domain object, <delete> to delete an instance
   of a domain object, <renew> to extend the validity period of a
   contact object, <transfer> to manage domain object sponsorship
   changes, and <update> to change information associated with a contact
   object.

5.2.1.  EPP <create> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <create> command
   or <create> response described in the EPP contact mapping [RFC5733]

5.2.2.  EPP <delete> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <delete> command
   or <delete> response described in the EPP contact mapping [RFC5733].

5.2.3.  EPP <renew> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <renew> command
   or <renew> response described in the EPP contact mapping [RFC5733].

5.2.4.  EPP <transfer> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <transfer>
   command or <transfer> response described in the EPP contact mapping
   [RFC5733].

5.2.5.  EPP <update> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <update> command
   or <update> response described in the EPP contact mapping [RFC5733].

6.  Formal Syntax

   An EPP object mapping is specified in XML Schema notation.  The
   formal syntax presented here is a complete schema representation of
   the object mapping suitable for automated validation of EPP XML
   instances.  The BEGIN and END tags are not part of the schema; they
   are used to note the beginning and ending of the schema for URI
   registration purposes.

7.  Internationalization Considerations

   EPP is represented in XML, which provides native support for encoding
   information using the Unicode character set and its more compact
   representations including UTF-8.  Conformant XML processors recognize
   both UTF-8 and UTF-16.  Though XML includes provisions to identify
   and use other character encodings through use of an "encoding"
   attribute in an <?xml?> declaration, use of UTF-8 is RECOMMENDED.

Internet-DraftVerification Extension for the EPP Contact MaDecember 2015


   As an extension of the EPP contact mapping, the elements, element
   content described in this document MUST inherit the
   internationalization conventions used to represent higher-layer
   domain and core protocol structures present in an XML instance that
   includes this extension.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  XML Namespace

   This document uses URNs to describe XML namespaces and XML schemas
   conforming to a registry mechanism described in [RFC3688].  IANA is
   requested to assignment the following URI.

   Registration request for the reseller namespace:

   o  URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:vericontact-1.0

   o  Registrant Contact: See the "Author's Address" section of this
      document.

   o  XML: See the "Formal Syntax" section of this document.

8.2.  EPP Extension Registry

   The EPP extension described in this document should be registered by
   the IANA in the EPP Extension Registry described in [RFC7451].  The
   details of the registration are as follows:

   Name of Extension: Contact Verification Extension

   Document status: Informational

   Reference: (insert reference to RFC version of this document)

   Registrant Name and Email Address: See the "Author's Address" section
   of this document.

   TLDs: any

   IPR Disclosure: none

   Status: active

   Notes: none

9.  Security Considerations

   The object mapping extension described in this document does not
   provide any other security services or introduce any additional
   considerations beyond those described by [RFC5730], [RFC5733] or
   those caused by the protocol layers used by EPP.
