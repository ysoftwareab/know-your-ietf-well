               draft-richardson-anima-l2-friendly-acp-01

Abstract

   This document details the challenges with building an Autonomic
   Control Plane on Campus/Enterprise networks which are built out of
   layer-two (Ethernet) switched technologies.

   This document does not propose a specific solution as yet, but
   details a number of possibilities, and what it would take to
   standardize each possibility.

1.  Introduction

   The creation and maintenance of the Autonomic Control Plane described
   in [I-D.ietf-anima-autonomic-control-plane] requires creation of hop-
   by-hop discovery of adjacent systems.  There are Campus L2 systems
   that are not broadcast safe until they have been connected to their
   Software Defined Networking (SDN) controller.  The use of the stable
   connectivity provided by [RFC8368] can provide the SDN connectivity
   required.

   There is a bootstrap interlocking problem: the network may be unsafe
   for ACP discovery broadcasts without the support of Spanning Tree
   Protocol (STP) or similar mechanisms until configured, yet it can not
   be automatically configured until the ACP discovery (and onboarding
   process) is done.  Meantime, because of STP complicated topological
   calculations, the convergence can be very slow for larger networks.
   This can delay on-boarding.

   In addition, forming a campus-wide network by default and using
   enabling STP does not work.  STP is not secure and could be easily
   spoofed by malicious or untrusted devices.  On manually configured
   networks today, STP is turned off on "access" ports, and enabled only
   for trunk ports.  But in an autonomic network, it is not possible to
   know a-priori which ports will be trunk ports, so STP would have to
   be on by default it is was to be used.

   What is needed is a way to send IPv6 traffic between these L2
   switching devices in a way that is never forwarded, regardless of how
   the network is eventually configured.  This is not just an inital
   configuration problem: devices may be added and removed at any time,
   due to needed expansion of capacity, planned upgrades, or devices
   failures.

   A previous version of this document had proposed to do this with
   LLDP, but this was an inappropriate use of LLDP.  An analysis of
   switching fabric options revealed that there were also no
   particularly advantage to this "hack", as it did not save any fabric
   resources.

   What is desired is another encapsulation that has the same forwarding
   properties as LLDP.

   It is noted that EAPoL (Ethernet Type 0x888e) also has the desired
   properties.

   The ISIS routing protocol also uses a specific EtherType, and some
   implementations have the desired property of never forwarding.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Functional Requirements

   1.  The encapsulation should be capable of transferring full-size
       (1280 byte) IPv6 packets.

   2.  The encapsulation should not be confused with standard unicase
       IPv6 Ethernet encapsulation using EtherType 0x86DD.

   3.  Even when in a very primitive "default" or power-on
       configuration, a switching fabric should never forward frames
       received on one port to any other port.

   4.  It should be possible to send these frames from the forwarding
       engine to some control plane system for specific processing.
       When doing so, the physical port number needs to be associated
       with the frame.

   5.  It should be possible for control plane daemons to send frames
       for transmission on any port, and to that port only, even if that
       port is part of a larger layer-2 domain.

3.  Nice to have Functionality

   1.  As the ACP uses IPsec over IPv6-Link-Layer packets, if a
       switching fabric has accelerated hardware for IPsec ESP, then it
       would be desireable if the encapsulation format did not get in
       the way of doing that.

   2.  As the ACP forms a private layer-3 Virtual Routing Fabric (VRF)
       on top of the tunnels, if the switching fabric has accelerated
       support for this, then it would also be useful to be able to use
       it.

   It is likely that many L2 switching fabrics may not support IPsec
   ESP, or L3 routing.  It was always the case that the ACP might have
   to be implemented as a software fabric in a control plane CPU.  This
   is not a significant hurdle, as the ACP is not intended to be used
   for customer data, only control plane communication, and often only
   as a last resort.

4.  Possibilities

   There are two things which distinguish LLDP, EAPoL and ISIS traffic
   from regular traffic.

   The most obivous is the EtherType.

   LLDP traffic also uses a destination multicast address:
   01:80:c2:00:00:0e, 01:80:c2:00:00:03, or 01:80:c2:00:00:00.  The use
   of this destination address facilitiates transmission of the traffic
   through unmanaged switches ("dumb ethernet switches"), as well as
   allowing for seperation of provider and customer traffic in provider
   bridged (IEEE 802.1ad) situations.

4.1.  Just use special destination

   There does not appear to be any legitimate use of Ethertype 0x86DD
   (normal IPv6) with the special multicast destinations listed above.
   When IPv6 multicast is used, it is mapped to a destination multicast
   address that starts with 0x3333.

   It would therefore be possible to use the normal encapsulation, but a
   special destination address.  This would probably occupy a single
   entry in a multicast destination table for the switch.  On some
   devices, it may require an entry per physical port.  (More data is
   sought)

4.2.  Use another EtherType

   Another Ethertype could be registered.  It would behave exactly like
   0x86DD, but would be treated differently.  As neither layer-2 nor
   layer-3 forwarding is desired for this ethertype, it may not be
   necessary to modify any forwarding engines.  To remind: ACP traffic
   that does need to be forwarded would first be decapsulated from the
   IPsec ESP.  At which point the packet would be an IPv6 packet, and it
   would need to be encapsulated again before forwarded.  So it would be
   the ESP engine that might need changes.

4.3.  Do something with EAPoL

   It maybe that the hack which was undesireable for LLDP may be well
   accepted when done for EAPoL.

5.  Privacy Considerations

   YYY

6.  Security Considerations

   Unclear as yet.

7.  IANA Considerations

   None yet.

8.  Acknowledgements

   Paul Congdon was very helpful in understanding how LLDP was actually
   processed in production equipment.
