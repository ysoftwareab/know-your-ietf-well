Abstract 
    
   To facilitate the establishment of Label Switched Paths (LSP) that 
   would span multiple IGP areas in a given Autonomous System (AS), this 
   document describes a new optional Longest Match Label Mapping 
   Procedure for the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP). 
    
   This procedure allows the use of a label if the Forwarding 
   Equivalence Class (FEC) Element matches an entry in the routing table 
   (RIB). Matching is defined by an IP longest match search and does not 
   mandate an exact match.

   Link state Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) such as OSPF [OSPFv2] 
   and IS-IS [IS-IS] allow the partition of an autonomous system into 
   areas or levels so as to increase routing scalability within a 
   routing domain.

Internet Draft     LDP extensions for Inter-Area LSP          June 2008 
 
 
   However, [LDP] recommends that the IP address of the FEC Element 
   should *exactly* match an entry in the IP RIB: according to [LDP] 
   section 3.5.7.1 (Label Mapping Messages Procedures) "A Label 
   Switching Router  (LSR) receiving a Label Mapping message from a 
   downstream LSR for a Prefix SHOULD NOT use the label for forwarding 
   unless its routing table contains an entry that exactly matches the 
   FEC Element.". 
    
   Therefore, MPLS LSPs between Label Edge Routers (LERs) in different 
   areas/levels are not setup unless the specific (e.g. /32 for IPv4) 
   loopback addresses of all the LERs are redistributed across all 
   areas. 
    
   The problem statement is discussed in section 4. Then, in section 5 
   we extend the Label Mapping Procedure defined in [LDP] so as to 
   support the setup of contiguous inter-area LSPs while maintaining IP 
   prefix aggregation on the ABRs. This consists of allowing for longest 
   match based Label Mapping. 
    
4.      Problem statement 
    
   Provider based MPLS (Multi Protocol Label Switching) networks are 
   expanding with the success of Layer 3 VPN (Virtual Private Networks 
   [L3-VPN]) and the new deployments of layer 2 VPNs ([VPLS-BGP], [VPLS-
   LDP]). Service providers MPLS backbones are significantly growing 
   both in terms of density with the addition of Provider Edge (PE) 
   routers to connect new customers and in terms of footprint as 
   traditional layer two aggregation networks may be replaced by IP/MPLS 
   networks. 
   As a consequence many providers need to introduce IGP areas. Inter-
   area LSPs, that is LSPs that traverse at least two IGP areas, are 
   required to ensure MPLS connectivity between PEs located in distinct 
   IGP areas.  
    
   To set up the required MPLS LSPs between PEs in different IGP areas, 
   service providers have currently three solutions: 1) LDP with IGP 
   route leaking, 2) BGP [MPLS-BGP] over LDP with MPLS hierarchy, and 3) 
   inter-area RSVP-TE (Resource Reservation Protocol-Traffic Engineering 
   [RSVP-TE]). 
    
   IGP route leaking consists in redistributing all specific PE loopback 
   addresses across area boundaries. As a result, LDP finds in the 
   Routing Information Base (RIB) an exact match for its FEC and sets up 
   the LSP. As a consequence, the potential benefits that a multi-area 
   domain may yield are significantly diminished since a lot of 
   addresses have to be redistributed by ABRs, and the number of IP 
   entries in the IGP Link State DataBase (LSDB), RIB and FIB maintained 
   by every LSR of the domain (whatever the area/level it belongs to) 
   cannot be minimized.

   Service providers may also set up these inter-area LSPs by using MPLS 
   hierarchy with BGP [MPLS-BGP] as a label distribution protocol 
   between areas. The BGP next hop would typically be the ABRs and the 
   BGP-created LSPs would be nested within intra-area LSPs setup by LDP 
   between PEs and ABRs and between ABRs. 
   This solution is not adequate for service providers which don't want 
   to run BGP on their P routers as it requires BGP on all ABRs. In 
   addition, MPLS hierarchy does not allow locally protecting the LSP 
   against ABR failures (IP/LDP Fast Reroute), and hence ensuring sub-
   50ms recovery upon ABR failure. The resulting convergence time may 
   not be acceptable for stringent Service Level Agreements (SLAs) 
   required for voice or mission critical applications. Finally, this 
   solution requires a significant migration effort for service 
   providers which started with LDP and IGP route leaking to quickly 
   set-up the first inter-area LSPs. 
    
   Service providers may also setup these inter-area LSPs by using 
   inter-area RSVP-TE [RSVP-TE]. This is a relevant solution when RSVP-
   TE is already used for setting up intra-area LSPs, and inter-area 
   traffic engineering features are required. In return this is not a 
   desired solution when LDP is already used for setting up intra-area 
   LSPs, and inter-area traffic engineering features are not required. 
 
   To avoid the above drawbacks, there is a need for an LDP based 
   solution which allows setting up contiguous inter-area LSPs while 
   avoiding leaking of specific PE loopback addresses across area 
   boundaries, and hence keeping all the benefits of IGP hierarchy. 
    
   In that context, this document defines a new LDP Label Mapping 
   Procedure so as to support the setup of contiguous inter-area LSPs 
   while maintaining IP prefix aggregation on the ABRs. This procedure 
   is similar to the one defined in [LDP] but performs an IP longest 
   match when searching the FEC element in the RIB. 
    
5. Longest Match Label Mapping Message Procedure 
    
   This document defines a new Label Mapping Procedure for [LDP]. It is 
   applicable to IPv4 and IPv6 prefix FEC elements (address families 1 
   and 2 as per [ASSIGNED_AF]). It SHOULD be possible to activate / 
   deactivate this procedure by configuration and it SHOULD be 
   deactivated by default. It MAY be possible to activate it on a per 
   prefix basis. 
    
   With this new Longest Match Label Mapping Procedure, an LSR receiving 
   a Label Mapping message from a neighbor LSR for a Prefix Address FEC 
   Element FEC1 SHOULD use the label for MPLS forwarding if its routing 
   table contains an entry that matches the FEC Element FEC1 and the 
   advertising LSR is a next hop to reach FEC1. If so, it SHOULD 
   advertise the received FEC Element FEC1 and a label to its LDP peers.

   By "matching FEC Element", one should understand an IP longest match. 
   That is, either the LDP FEC element exactly matches an entry in the 
   IP RIB or the FEC element is a subset of an IP RIB entry. There is no 
   match for other cases such as the FEC element is a superset of a RIB 
   entry. 
   Note that LDP re-advertises to its peers the specific FEC element 
   FEC1, and not the aggregated prefix found in the IP RIB during the 
   longest match search. 
    
   Note that with this Longest Match Label Mapping Procedure, each LSP 
   established by LDP still strictly follows the shortest path(s) 
   defined by the IGP. 
    
   FECs selected by this Longest Match Label Mapping Procedure are 
   distributed in an ordered way. In case of LER failure, the removal of 
   reachability to the FEC occurs using LDP ordered label distribution 
   mode procedures. As defined in [LDP] in section A.1.5, the FEC will 
   be removed in an ordered way through the propagation of Label 
   Withdraw messages. The use of this (un)reachability information by 
   application layers using this MPLS LSP (e.g., [MP-BGP]) is outside 
   the scope of this document. 
    
   As per [LDP], LDP has already some interactions with the RIB. In 
   particular, it needs to be aware of the following events: 
     - prefix up when a new IP prefix appears in the RIB, 
     - prefix down when an existing IP prefix disappears, 
     - next hop change when an existing IP prefix has a new next hop 
        following a routing change. 
    
   With this Longest Match Label Mapping Message Procedure, multiple 
   FECs may be concerned by a single RIB prefix change. The LSR MUST 
   check all the FECs which are a subset of this RIB prefix. So some LDP 
   reactions following a RIB event are changed: 
     - When a new prefix appears in the RIB, the LSR MUST check if this 
        prefix is a better match for some existing FECs. E.g. the FEC 
        elements 192.0.2.1/32 and 192.0.2.2/32 used the IP RIB entry 
        192.0.2.0/24 and a new more specific IP RIB entry 192.0.2.0/26 
        appears. This may result in changing the LSR used as next hop 
        and hence the Next Hop Label Forwarding Entry (NHLFE) for this 
        FEC. 
     - When a prefix disappears in the RIB, the LSR MUST check all FEC 
        elements which are using this RIB prefix as best match. For each 
        FEC, if another RIB prefix is found as best match, LDP MUST use 
        it. This may result in changing the LSR used as next hop and 
        hence the NHLFE for this FEC. Otherwise, the LSR MUST remove the 
        FEC binding and send a Label Withdraw message. 
     - When the next hop of a RIB prefix changes, the LSR MUST change 
        the NHLFE of all the FEC elements using this prefix.

   Future work may define new management objects to the MPLS LDP MIB 
   modules [LDP-MIB] to activate/deactivate this Longest Match Label 
   Mapping Message Procedure, possibly on a per prefix basis. 
    
6. Application examples 
    
6.1. Inter-area LSPs 
    
   Consider the following example of an autonomous system with one 
   backbone area and two edge areas: 
    
    
                            Area "B" 
    
                    Level 2 / Backbone area 
    
                 +--------------------------+ 
        Area "A" |                          |  Area "C" 
                 |                          |   
        Level 1  |                          |  Level 1 / area 
                 |        P1                | 
      +----------+                          +-------------+ 
      |          |                 P2       |         PE1 | 192.0.2.1/32 
      |          |                          |             | 
      |PE4      ABR2                       ABR1       PE2 | 192.0.2.2/32 
      |          |        P3                |             | 
      |          |                          |         PE3 | 192.0.2.3/32 
      +----------+                          +-------------+ 
                 |                          | 
                 +--------------------------+

   Area. 
    
   Note that this applies equally to IS-IS and OSPF. An ABR refers here 
   either to an OSPF ABR or to an IS-IS L1/L2 node. 
    
   All routers are MPLS enabled and MPLS connectivity (i.e. an LSP) is 
   required between all PE routers. 
    
    
   In the "egress" area "C", the records available are: 
   IGP RIB                          LDP FEC elements: 
     192.0.2.1/32                      192.0.2.1/32 
     192.0.2.2/32                      192.0.2.2/32 
     192.0.2.3/32                      192.0.2.3/32 
    
    
   The area border router ABR1 advertises in the backbone area: 
     - the aggregated IP prefix 192.0.2.0/26 in the IGP 
     - all the specific IP FEC elements (/32) in LDP

   In the "backbone" area "B", the records available are: 
   IGP RIB                          LDP FEC elements: 
     192.0.2.0/26                     192.0.2.1/32 
                                      192.0.2.2/32 
                                      192.0.2.3/32 
    
    
   The area border router ABR2 advertises in the area "A": 
     - an aggregated IP prefix 192.0.2.0/24 in the IGP 
     - all the individual IP FEC elements (/32) in LDP 
    
    
   In the "ingress" area "A", the records available are: 
   IGP RIB                          LDP FEC elements: 
     192.0.2.0/24                     192.0.2.1/32 
                                      192.0.2.2/32 
                                      192.0.2.3/32 
    
   In this situation, one LSP is established between the ingress PE4 and 
   every egress PE of area C while maintaining IP prefix aggregation on 
   the ASBRs. 
    
6.2. Use of static routes 
    
   Consider the following example where a LER is dual-connected to two 
   LSRs: 
    
                    +--------LSR1---- 
                    |         | 
                   LER        | 
                    |         | 
                    +--------LSR2---- 
    
                 Figure 2: LER dual-connected to two LSRs. 
    
   In some situations, especially on the edge of the network, it is 
   valid to use static IP routes between the LER and the two LSRs. If 
   necessary, the BFD protocol ([BFD]) can be used to quickly detect 
   loss of connectivity. 
    
   The LDP specification defined in [LDP] would require on the ingress 
   LER the configuration and the maintenance of one IP route per egress 
   LER and per outgoing interface. 
    
   The Longest Match Label Mapping Procedure described in this document 
   only requires one IP route per outgoing interface.

7. Caveats for deployment 
    
7.1. Deployment considerations 
    
   LSRs compliant with this document are backward compatible with LSRs 
   that comply with [LDP]. 
    
   For the successful establishment of end-to-end MPLS LSPs whose FEC 
   are aggregated in the RIB, this specification must be implemented on 
   all LSRs in all areas where IP aggregation is used. If an LSR on the 
   path does not support this procedure, then the LSP initiated on the 
   egress LSR stops at this non compliant LSR. There are no other 
   adverse effects. 
    
   This extension can be deployed incrementally: 
     - It can be deployed on a per area or routing domain basis and 
        does not necessarily require an AS wide deployment. For example, 
        if all specific IP prefixes are leaked in the IGP backbone area 
        and only stub areas use IP aggregation, LSRs in the backbone 
        area don't need to be compliant with this document. 
     - Within each routing area, LSRs can be upgraded independently, at 
        any time, in any order and without service disruption. During 
        deployment, if those LSPs are already used, one should only make 
        sure that ABRs keep advertising the specific IP prefixes in the 
        IGP until all LSR of this area are successfully upgraded. Then, 
        the ABRs can advertise the aggregated prefix only and stop 
        advertising the specific ones. 
    
   A service provider currently leaking specific LER's loopback 
   addresses in the IGP and now considering performing IP aggregation on 
   ABR should be aware that this may result in suboptimal routing as 
   discussed in [RFC 2966]. 
    
7.2. Routing convergence time considerations 
    
   IP and MPLS traffic restoration time is based on two factors: the 
   Shortest Path First (SPF) calculation in the control plane and 
   Forwarding Information Base (FIB)/Label FIB (LFIB) update time in the 
   forwarding plane.  The SPF calculation scales O(N*Log(N)) where N is 
   the number of Nodes. The FIB/LFIB update scales O(P) where P is the 
   number of modified prefixes. Currently, with most routers 
   implementations, the FIB/LFIB update is the dominant component [1] 
   and therefore the bottleneck that should be addressed in priority. 
   The solution documented in this draft reduces the link state database 
   size in the control plane and the number of FIB entries in the 
   forwarding plane. As such it solves the scaling of pure IP routers 
   sharing the IGP with MPLS routers. However, it does not decrease the 
   number of LFIB entries so is not sufficient to solve the scaling of 
   MPLS routers. For this, an additional mechanism is required (e.g. 
   introducing some MPLS hierarchy in LDP). This is out of scope of this 
   document.

   Compared to [LDP], for all failures except LER failure (i.e. links, 
   Ps and ABRs nodes), the failure notification and the convergence is 
   unchanged. For LER failure, given that the IGP aggregates IP routes 
   on ABRs and no longer advertise specific prefixes, the control plane 
   and more specifically the routing convergence behavior of protocols 
   (e.g. [MP-BGP]) or applications (e.g. [L3-VPN]) may be changed in 
   case of failure of the egress LER node. For protocols and 
   applications which need to track egress LER availability, several 
   solutions can be used, for example: 
   - Rely on the LDP ordered label distribution control mode - as 
     defined in [LDP] - to know the availability of the LSP toward the 
     egress LER. The egress to ingress propagation time of that 
     unreachability information is expected to be comparable to the IGP 
     (but this may be implementation dependant). 
   - Advertise LER reachability in the IGP for the purpose of the 
     control plane in a way that do not create IP FIB entries in the 
     forwarding plane. 
    
8. Security Considerations 
    
   The Longest Match Label Mapping procedure described in this document 
   does not introduce any change as far as the Security Consideration 
   section of [LDP] is concerned. 
    
9. IANA Considerations 
    
   This document has no actions for IANA.
