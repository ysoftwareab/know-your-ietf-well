Internet-Draft           SIP IPv6 Torture Tests               April 2007


1.  Overview

   This document is informational, and is NOT NORMATIVE on any aspect of
   SIP.

   This document contains test messages based on the current version
   (2.0) of the Session Initiation Protocol as defined in [RFC3261].

   This document is expected to be used as a companion document to the
   more general SIP torture test document [RFC4475], which does not
   include specific tests for IPv6 network identifiers.

   This document does not attempt to catalog every way to make an
   invalid message, nor does it attempt to be comprehensive in exploring
   unusual, but valid, messages.  Instead, it tries to focus on areas
   that may cause interoperability problems in IPv6 deployments.


2.  Document conventions

   This document contains many example SIP messages.  The appendix
   contains an encoded binary form containing the bit-exact
   representation of the messages and the algorithm needed to decode
   them into separate files.

   The IPv6 addresses used in this document correspond to the 2001:
   DB8::/32 address prefix reserved for documentation [RFC3489].
   Likewise, the IPv4 addresses used in this document correspond to the
   192.0.2.0/24 address block as described in [RFC3330].

   Although SIP is a text-based protocol, some of these examples cannot
   be unambiguously rendered without additional markup due to the
   constraints placed on the formatting of RFCs.  This document uses the
   <allOneLine/> markup convention established in [RFC4475] to avoid
   ambiguity and meet the Internet-Draft layout requirements.  For the
   sake of completeness, the text defining this markup from Section 2.1
   of [RFC4475] is reproduced in its entirety below:

   "Several of these examples contain unfolded lines longer than 72
   characters.  These are captured between <allOneLine/> tags.  The
   single unfolded line is reconstructed by directly concatenating all
   lines appearing between the tags (discarding any line feeds or
   carriage returns).  There will be no whitespace at the end of lines.
   Any whitespace appearing at a fold-point will appear at the beginning
   of a line.

   "The following represent the same string of bits:

         <allOneLine>
         Header-name: first value,
          reallylongsecondvalue
         , third value

         Header-name: first value,
          reallylong
         second
         value,
          third value
         </allOneLine>

      "Note that this is NOT SIP header-line folding, where different
      strings of bits have equivalent meaning."


3.  SIP and IPv6 network configuration

   System-level issues like deploying a dual-stack proxy server,
   populating DNS with A and AAAA RRs, zero-configuration discovery of
   outbound proxies for IPv4 and IPv6 networks, when should a dual-stack
   proxy Record-Route itself, and media issues also play a major part in
   the transition to IPv6.  This document does not, however, address
   these issues.  Instead, a companion document [ID.sip-trans] provides
   more guidance on these issues.


4.  Parser torture tests

   The test messages are organized into several sections.  Some stress
   only a SIP parser and others stress both the parser and the
   application above it.  Some messages are valid, and some are not.
   Each example clearly calls out what makes any invalid messages
   incorrect.

   Please refer to the complete ABNF in [RFC3261] on representing IPv6
   references in SIP.  IPv6 references are delimited by a "[" and "]".
   When an IPv6 reference is part of a SIP Uniform Resource Identifier
   (URI), RFC3261 mandates that the "IPv6reference" production rule be
   used to recognize tokens that comprise an IPv6 reference.  More
   specifically, the ABNF states:

     SIP-URI        =  "sip:" [ userinfo ] hostport
                       uri-parameters [ headers ]
     hostport       =  host [ ":" port ]
     host           =  hostname / IPv4address / IPv6reference
     IPv6reference  =  "[" IPv6address "]"
     IPv6address    =  hexpart [ ":" IPv4address ]
     hexpart        =  hexseq / hexseq "::" [ hexseq ] / "::" [ hexseq ]
     hexseq         =  hex4 *( ":" hex4)
     hex4           =  1*4HEXDIG

4.1.  Valid SIP message with an IPv6 reference

   The request below is well-formatted according to the grammar in
   RFC3261.  An IPv6 reference appears in the Request-URI (R-URI), Via
   header, and Contact header.

   Message Details: ipv6-good

      REGISTER sip:[2001:db8::10] SIP/2.0
      To: sip:user@example.com
      From: sip:user@example.com;tag=81x2
      Via: SIP/2.0/UDP [2001:db8::9:1];branch=z9hG4bKas3-111
      Call-ID: SSG9559905523997077@hlau_4100
      Max-Forwards: 70
      Contact: "Caller" <sip:caller@[2001:db8::1]>
      CSeq: 98176 REGISTER
      Content-Length: 0


4.2.  Invalid SIP message with an IPv6 reference

   The request below is not well-formatted according to the grammar in
   RFC3261.  The IPv6 reference in the R-URI does not contain the
   mandated delimiters for an IPv6 reference ("[" and "]").

   An element receiving this request should respond with a 400 Bad
   Request error.

   Message Details: ipv6-bad

      REGISTER sip:2001:db8::10 SIP/2.0
      To: sip:user@example.com
      From: sip:user@example.com;tag=81x2

4.3.  Port ambiguous in a URI

   IPv6 uses the colon to delimit octets.  This may lead to ambiguity if
   the port number on which to contact a SIP server is inadvertently
   conflated with the IPv6 reference.  Consider the REGISTER request
   below.  The sender of the request intended to specify a port number
   (5070) to contact a server, but inadvertently, inserts the port
   number inside the closing "]" of the IPv6 reference.  Unfortunately,
   since the IPv6 address in the R-URI is compressed, the intended port
   number becomes the last octet of the reference.

   From a parsing perspective, the request below is well-formed.
   However, from a semantic point of view, it will not yield the desired
   result.  Implementations must ensure that when a raw IPv6 address
   appears in a SIP URI, then a port number, if required, appears
   outside the closing "]" delimiting the IPv6 reference.  Raw IPv6
   addresses can appear in the "sent-by" production rule of the Via
   header, the Contact header, the Route and Record-Route headers, among
   other headers.  Implementers are urged to consult the ABNF in RFC3261
   for a complete list of headers where a SIP URI can appear.

   Message Details: port-ambiguous

      REGISTER sip:[2001:db8::10:5070] SIP/2.0
      To: sip:user@example.com
      From: sip:user@example.com;tag=81x2
      Via: SIP/2.0/UDP [2001:db8::9:1];branch=z9hG4bKas3-111

      Max-Forwards: 70
      CSeq: 98176 REGISTER
      Content-Length: 0


4.4.  Port unambiguous in a URI

   In contrast to the example in Section 4.3, the following REGISTER
   request leaves no ambiguity whatsoever on where the IPv6 address ends
   and the port number begins.  This REGISTER request is well formatted
   per the grammar in RFC3261.

   Message Details: port-unambiguous

4.5.  IPv6 reference delimiters in Via header addresses

   IPv6 references can also appear in Via headers; more specifically in
   the "sent-by" production rule and the "via-received" production rule.
   In the "sent-by" production rule, the sequence of octets comprising
   the IPv6 address is defined to appear as an "IPv6reference" non-
   terminal, thereby mandating the "[" and "]" delimiters.  However,
   this is not the case for the "via-received" non-terminal.  The "via-
   received" production rule is defined thusly:

      via-received = "received" EQUAL (IPv4address / IPv6address)

   The "IPv6address" non-terminal is defined not to include the
   delimiting "[" and "]".  This has lead to the situation documented
   during the 18th SIP Interoperability Event [Email-SIPit]:

      Those testing IPv6 made different assumptions about enclosing
      literal v6 addresses in Vias in [].  By the end of the event, most
      implementations were accepting either.  Its about 50/50 on what
      gets sent.

   While it would be beneficial if the same non-terminal
   ("IPv6reference") was used for both the "sent-by" and "via-received"
   production rules, there has not been a consensus in the working group
   to that effect.  Thus, the best that can be suggested is that
   implementations must follow the Robustness Principle [RFC1122] and be
   liberal in accepting a "received" parameter with or without the
   delimiting "[" and "]" tokens.  When sending a request,
   implementations must not put the delimiting "[" and "]" tokens.

   The two test cases below are designed to stress this behavior.  An
   element receiving either of these messages must parse them
   successfully.

   The request below contains an IPv6 address in the Via received
   parameter.  The IPv6 address is delimited by "[" and "]".  Even
   though this is not a valid request based on a strict interpretation

   of the grammar in RFC3261, robust implementations must nonetheless be
   able to parse the topmost Via header and continue processing the
   request.

5.  Security considerations

   This document presents NON-NORMATIVE examples of SIP session
   establishment.  The security considerations in [RFC3261] apply.

   Parsers must carefully consider edge conditions and malicious input
   as part of their design.  Attacks on many Internet systems use
   crafted input to cause implementations to behave in undesirable ways.
   Many of the messages in this draft are designed to stress a parser
   implementation at points traditionally used for such attacks.  This
   document does not, however, attempt to be comprehensive.  It contains
   some common pitfalls that the authors have discovered while parsing
   IPv6 identifiers in SIP implementations.


6.  IANA considerations

   This document does not contain any actions for IANA.

Appendix A.  Bit-exact archive of each test message

   The following text block is an encoded, gzip compressed TAR archive
   of files that represent each of the example messages discussed in
   Section 4.

   To recover the compressed archive file intact, the text of this
   document may be passed as input to the following Perl script (the
   output should be redirected to a file or piped to "tar -xzvf -").


   #!/usr/bin/perl
   use strict;
   my $bdata = "";
   use MIME::Base64;
   while(<>) {
     if (/-- BEGIN MESSAGE ARCHIVE --/ .. /-- END MESSAGE ARCHIVE --/) {
          if ( m/^\s*[^\s]+\s*$/) {
              $bdata = $bdata . $_;
          }
     }
   }
   print decode_base64($bdata);

   Alternatively, the base-64 encoded block can be edited by hand to
   remove document structure lines and fed as input to any base-64
   decoding utility.
