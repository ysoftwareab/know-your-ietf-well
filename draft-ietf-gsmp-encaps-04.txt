Internet Draft        GSMP Packet Encapsulations      August 2001 

   


Abstract 

  This memo specifies the encapsulation of GSMP packets in ATM, 
  Ethernet and TCP.  


1. Introduction 

  GSMP messages are defined in [1] and MAY be encapsulated in 
  several different protocols for transport. This memo specifies 
  their encapsulation in ATM AAL-5, in Ethernet or in TCP. Other 
  encapsulations may be defined in future specifications. 


2. ATM Encapsulation 

  GSMP packets are variable length and for an ATM data link layer 
  they are encapsulated directly in an AAL-5 CPCS-PDU [3][4] with an 
  LLC/SNAP header as illustrated: 
   
    0                   1                   2                   3

  (The convention in the documentation of Internet Protocols [5] is 
  to express numbers in decimal. Numbers in hexadecimal format are 
  specified by prefacing them with the characters "0x". Numbers in 
  binary format are specified by prefacing them with the characters 
  "0b". Data is pictured in "big-endian" order. That is, fields are 
  described left to right, with the most significant byte on the 
  left and the least significant byte on the right. Whenever a 
  diagram shows a group of bytes, the order of transmission of those

  bytes is the normal order in which they are read in English. 
  Whenever an byte represents a numeric quantity the left most bit 
  in the diagram is the high order or most significant bit. That is, 
  the bit labelled 0 is the most significant bit. Similarly, 
  whenever a multi-byte field represents a numeric quantity the left 
  most bit of the whole field is the most significant bit. When a 
  multi-byte quantity is transmitted, the most significant byte is 
  transmitted first. This is the same coding convention as is used 
  in the ATM layer [2] and AAL-5 [3][4].) 

  The LLC/SNAP header contains the bytes: 0xAA 0xAA 0x03 0x00 0x00 
  0x00 0x88 0x0C. (0x880C is the assigned Ethertype for GSMP.) 

  The maximum transmission unit (MTU) of the GSMP Message field is 
  1492 bytes. 

  The virtual channel over which a GSMP session is established 
  between a controller and the switch it is controlling is called 
  the GSMP control channel. The default VPI and VCI of the GSMP 
  control channel for LLC/SNAP encapsulated GSMP messages on an ATM 
  data link layer is: 

     VPI = 0 
     VCI = 15. 

  The GSMP control channel MAY be changed using the GSMP MIB. 


3. Ethernet Encapsulation 

  GSMP packets MAY be encapsulated on an Ethernet data link as 
  illustrated:

  Destination Address  
             For the SYN message of the adjacency protocol the 
             Destination Address is the broadcast address 
             0xFFFFFFFFFFFF. (Alternatively, it is also valid to 
             configure the node with the unicast 48-bit IEEE MAC 
             address of the destination. In this case the configured 
             unicast Destination Address is used in the SYN message.) 
             For all other messages the Destination Address is the 
             unicast 48- bit IEEE MAC address of the destination. 
             This address may be discovered from the Source Address 
             field of messages received during synchronisation of the 
             adjacency protocol. 

  Source Address  
             For all messages the Source Address is the 48-bit IEEE 
             MAC address of the sender. 

  Ethertype  The assigned Ethertype for GSMP is 0x880C. 
  GSMP Message  
             The maximum transmission unit (MTU) of the GSMP Message 
             field is 1492 bytes.

  Sender Instance  
             The Sender Instance number for the link obtained from 
             the adjacency protocol. This field is already present in 
             the adjacency protocol message. It is appended to all 
             non-adjacency GSMP messages in the Ethernet 
             encapsulation to offer additional protection against the 
             introduction of corrupt state. 

  Receiver Instance  
             The Receiver Instance number is what the sender believes 
             is the current instance number for the link, allocated 
             by the entity at the far end of the link. This field is 
             already present in the adjacency protocol message. It is 
             appended to all non-adjacency GSMP messages in the 
             Ethernet encapsulation to offer additional protection 
             against the introduction of corrupt state. 

  Pad  
             After adjacency has been established the minimum length 
             of the data field of an Ethernet packet is 46 bytes. If 
             necessary, padding should be added such that it meets 
             the minimum Ethernet frame size. This padding should be 
             bytes of zero and it is not considered to be part of the 
             GSMP message. 

  Frame Check Sequence 
             The Frame Check Sequence (FCS) is defined in IEEE 802.3 
             [6] as follows:  

                 Note: This section is included for informational 
                 and historical purposes only. The normative 
                 reference can be found in IEEE 802.3 Standard [6] 

                  "A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is used by the 
                 transmit and receive algorithms to generate a CRC 
                 value for the FCS field. 
                 The frame check sequence (FCS) field contains a 4-
                 byte (32-bit) cyclic redundancy check (CRC) value. 
                 This value is computed as a function of the 
                 contents of the source address, destination 
                 address, length, LLC data and pad (that is, all 
                 fields except the preamble, SFD, FCS and 
                 extension). 
                 The encoding is defined by the following generating 
                 polynomial. 
                 G(x)=x^32+x^26+x^23+x^22+x^16+x^12+x^11+x^10+x^8+x^
                 7+x^5+x^4+x^2+x^1."

Internet Draft        GSMP Packet Encapsulations      August 2001 

                 The procedure for the CRC calculation can be found 
                 in [6]. 

  After the adjacency protocol has achieved synchronisation, for 
  every GSMP message received with an Ethernet encapsulation, the 
  receiver must check the Source Address from the Ethernet MAC 
  header, the Sender Instance, and the Receiver Instance. The 
  incoming GSMP message must be discarded if the Sender Instance and 
  the Source Address do not match the values of Sender Instance and 
  Sender Name stored by the "Update Peer Verifier" operation of the 
  GSMP adjacency protocol. The incoming GSMP message must also be 
  discarded if it arrives over any port other than the port over 
  which the adjacency protocol has achieved synchronisation. In 
  addition, the incoming message must also be discarded if the 
  Receiver Instance field does not match the current value for the 
  Sender Instance of the GSMP adjacency protocol. 


4. TCP/IP Encapsulation 

  When GSMP messages are transported over an IP network, they MUST 
  be transported using the TCP encapsulation. TCP provides reliable 
  transport, network flow control, and end-system flow control 
  suitable for networks that may have high loss and variable or 
  unpredictable delay. The GSMP encapsulation in TCP/IP also 
  provides sender authentication using an MD5 digest. 

  For TCP encapsulations of GSMP messages, the controller runs the 
  client code and the switch runs the server code. Upon 
  initialisation, the server is listening on GSMP's TCP port number: 
  6068. The controller establishes a TCP connection with each switch 
  it manages. The switch under control MUST be a multi-connection 
  server (PORT 6068) to allow creation of multiple control sessions 
  from N GSMP controller instances. Adjacency protocol messages, 
  which are used to synchronise the controller and switch and 
  maintain handshakes, are sent by the controller to the switch 
  after the TCP connection is established. GSMP messages other than 
  adjacency protocol messages MUST NOT be sent until after the 
  adjacency protocol has achieved synchronisation. The actual GSMP 
  message flow will occur on other ports. 

4.1 Message Formats 

  GSMP messages are sent over a TCP connection. A GSMP message is 
  processed only after it is entirely received. A four-byte TLV 
  header field is prepended to the GSMP message to provide 
  delineation of GSMP messages within the TCP stream.

  Type 
               This 2-byte field indicates the type code of the 
               following message. The type code for GSMP messages is 
               0x88-0C (i.e. the same as GSMP's Ethertype).  

  Length:  This 2-byte unsigned integer indicates the total length 
               of the GSMP message only. It does not including the 4-
               byte TLV header. 

4.2 TCP/IP Security consideration 

  When GSMPv3 is implemented for use in IP networks, provisions for 
  security between the controller and client MUST be available and 
  MUST be provided by IP Security [IPSEC]. In this case, the IPSEC 
  Authentication Header(AH) SHOULD be used for the validation of the 
  connection; additionally IPSEC Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP) 
  MAY be used to provide both validation and secrecy. 


5. Security Considerations 

  The security of GSMP's TCP/IP control channel has been addressed 
  in Section 4.2. For all uses of GSMP over an IP network it is 
  REQUIRED that GSMP be run over TCP/IP using the security 
  considerations discussed in Section 4.2. Security using ATM and 
  Ethernet encapsulations MAY be provided at the link layer.  
  Discussion of these methods is beyond the scope of this 
  specification.
