     Abstract 
         
        This document presents the group key management architecture for 
        MSEC.  The purpose of this document is to define the common 
        architecture for MSEC group key-management protocols that support a 
        variety of application, transport, and internetwork security 
        protocols.  To address these diverse uses, MSEC may need to 
        standardize two or more group key management protocols that have 
        common requirements, abstractions, overall design, and messages. The 
        framework and guidelines in this document allow for a modular and 
        flexible design of group key management protocols for a variety of 
        different settings that are specialized to application needs.

     1.0 Introduction: Purpose of this Document 
         
        Group and multicast applications have diverse requirements in IP 
        networks [CP00].  Their key management requirements, which are 
        briefly reviewed below (see Section 2.0), include support for 
        internetwork, transport, and application-layer protocols.  In 
        particular, while ISAKMP and IKE protocols purport to manage keys for 
        any and all services in a host, some applications may achieve simpler 
        operation by running key-management messaging over a pre-established 
        secure channel (e.g., TLS, IPsec).  Other security protocols may 
        benefit from a key management protocol that can run over already 
        deployed session initiation or management protocol (e.g., SIP or 
        RTSP). Finally, some may benefit from a light-weight keye management 
        protocol that finishes in fewest round trips.  For these reasons, 
        application, transport, and internetwork-layer security protocols 
        such as SRTP, IPsec, and AMESP may benefit from using different group 
        key management systems.  The most popular key management protocols 
        deployed today provide support for a number of real-world scenarios 
        such as NAT traversal (e.g., IKE).  Thus any general purpose group 
        key management protocol might also need to provide such 
        functionalities.  The purpose of this document is to define a common 
        architecture and design for these different group key-management 
        protocols for internet, transport, and application services. 
         
        The common architecture for group key management is called the "MSEC 
        Key Management Architecture" and is based on the group control or 
        key server model developed in GKMP [RFC2094] and assumed by group 
        key management algorithms such as LKH [RFC2627], OFT [McGrew and 
        Sherman], SDR [NNL], and MARKS.  There are other approaches that are 
        not considered in this architecture such as the highly distributed 
        Cliques group key management protocol [Tsudik, et. al.] and 
        broadcast key management schemes [Fiat & Naor, Wool].  MSEC 
        (Multicast SECurity) key management may in fact be complementary to 
        other group key management designs, but these are not considered in 
        this document.  The integration of MSEC group key management with 
        Cliques, broadcast key management and other group key systems is not 
        considered in this document, which seeks to provide a group key 
        management framework for the MSEC suite of multicast security 
        protocols. 
         
        Indeed, key-management protocols are difficult to design and 
        validate.  The common architecture described in this document eases 
        this burden by defining common abstractions and overall design that 
        can be specialized for different uses. 
         
        This document builds on and extends the Group Key Management Building 
        Block document of the IRTF SMuG research group [HBH01] and is part of 
        the MSEC document roadmap. To correctly place the current document in 
        the context of the MSEC literature we include a copy of the MSEC 
        draft tree in the appendix.

        Section 2 discusses the security, performance and architectural 
        requirements for a group key management protocol. Section 3 presents 
        the overall architectural design principles. Section 4 describes the 
        Registration protocol in detail and Section 5 does the same for Rekey 
        protocol. Section 6 considers the interface to the Group Security 
        Association (GSA) using the standard keywords of RFC 2119. Section 7 
        reviews the scalability issues for group key management protocols and 
        Section 8 discusses Security Considerations.  
         
     2.0 Requirements for a group key management protocol 
         
        A group key management protocol supports multicast applications that 
        need a secure group.  A "secure group" is a collection of principals, 
        called "members," who may be senders, receivers or both receivers and 
        senders to other members of the group. (Note that group membership 
        may vary over time.) A "group key management protocol" helps to 
        ensure that only members of a secure group gain access to group data 
        (by gaining access to group keys) and can authenticate group data.  
        The goal of a group key management protocol is to provide legitimate 
        group members with the up-to-date cryptographic state they need for 
        their secrecy and authenticity requirements.  
         
        Multicast applications, such as video broadcast and multicast file 
        transfer, have the following key-management requirements (see also 
        [CP00]).   
         
        1. The group members receive "security associations" including  
           encryption keys, authentication/integrity keys, cryptographic  
           policy that describes the keys, and attributes such as an index  
           for referencing the security association (SA) or particular  
           objects contained in the SA. 
         
        2. Keys will have a predetermined lifetime and will be periodically  
           refreshed. 
         
        3. Key material are delivered securely to members of the group so  
           that they are secret, integrity-protected and can be verified as  
           coming from an authorized source. 
            
        4. The key-management protocol is also secure against replay attacks  
           and Denial of Service(DoS)attacks(see the Security Considerations  
           section of this memo). 
         
        5. The protocol adds and removes group members so that members who  
           are added may optionally be denied access to the key material used  
           before they joined the group, and that removed members lose access  
           to the key material following their departure. 
         
        6. The protocol supports a scalable group re-key operation without

           unicast exchange between members and a group controller/key  
           server, which might overwhelm a GCKS when the group is large. 
         
        7. The protocol is compatible with the infrastructure and performance  
           needs of the data-security application, such as IPsec security 
           protocols, AH and ESP, and/or application-layer security   
           protocols, AMESP and SRTP. (note: needs further clarification) 
         
        8. The key management protocol offers a framework for replacing or  
           renewing transforms, authorization infrastructure and  
           authentication systems. 
         
        9. The key management protocol must be secure against collusions  
           among excluded members and non-members.  Specifically, collusions 
           must not result in gaining any additional group secrets than the  
           colluding entities themselves are privy to. 
         
        10. The key management protocol must provide a mechanism to securely 
        recover from a compromise of some or all of the key material. 
         
        Although it is not a requirement for a multicast security protocol, 
        the group key management protocol may also be useful to unicast 
        applications that share many of the requirements of multicast 
        applications. In other words group key management protocols may be 
        used for protecting multicast communications, or communications in 
        groups where members communicate among themselves mainly via unicast. 
         
         
        There are other requirements for small group operation where there 
        will be many senders or in which all members may potentially be 
        senders.  In this case, the group setup time may need to be optimized 
        to support a small, highly interactive group environment [RFC2627].  
        A single group controller (or GCKS) may not be the best design for 
        small, interactive groups.  However, large single-source multicast 
        groups generally may benefit from the use of a specialized GCKS.  
        Large distributed simulations, moreover, may combine the need for 
        large-group operation with many senders. 
         
        We also take as a requirement the support of large single-sender 
        groups, such as source-specific (single-source) multicast groups.   
        Thus, group key management should support high-capacity operation to 
        large groups that have one or very few senders.  Nonetheless, 
        scalable operation to a range of group sizes is a desirable feature, 
        and a better group key management protocol will support large, 
        single-sender groups as well as groups that have many senders. It may 
        be that no single key management protocol can satisfy the scalability 
        requirements of all group-security applications.   The group key 
        management architecture allows two or more key management protocols, 
        where each protocol is suitable to a different scenario such large 
        single-source groups or small interactive groups.

        In addition to these requirements, it is useful to emphasize two non-
        requirements, namely, technical protection measures (TPM) and 
        broadcast key management.  TPM are used for such things as copy 
        protection by preventing the user of a device to get easy access to 
        the group keys. Although we should expect that a device under the 
        control of an attacker would lose its secrets to that attacker, some 
        TPM advocates see tamper-resistant technologies as a means to keep 
        honest people honest [MT] and want TPM for that purpose.  There is no 
        reason why a group key management protocol cannot be used in an 
        environment where the keys are kept in a "tamper-resistant" store 
        using various types of hardware or software to implement TPM.  The 
        group key management architecture described in this document, 
        however, is for key management protocols and not a design for 
        technical protection measures, which are outside the scope of this 
        document. 
         
        The second non-requirement is broadcast key management where there is 
        no back channel [FN93, JKKV94] or the device is not on a network, 
        such as a digital videodisk player.  We assume IP network operation 
        where there is two-way communication, however asymmetric, and that 
        authenticated key-exchange procedures can be used for member 
        registration.  It is possible that broadcast applications can make 
        use of a one-way Internet group key management protocol message, and 
        a one-way Re-key message is described below. 
         
     3.0 Overall Design 
      
        This section describes the overall structure of a group key 
        management protocol, and provides a reference implementation diagram 
        for group key management.  This design is based upon a group 
        controller model [RFC2093, RFC2094, RFC2627, OFT, GSAKMP, GDOI] with 
        a single group owner as the root-of-trust.  The group owner 
        designates a group controller for member registration and re-key. 
         
     3.1 Overview 
         
        The main goal of a group key management protocol is to securely 
        provide the group members with an up-to-date security association 
        (SA), which contains the needed information for securing group 
        communication (i.e., the group data). We call this SA the "Data 
        Security Protocol SA", or "Data SA" for short. In order to obtain 
        this goal, the Group Key Management Architecture consists of the 
        following protocols. 
         
          (1) Registration protocol. 
              ===================== 
          This is a two-way unicast protocol between the group controller/key 
        server (GCKS) and a joining group member. In this protocol the GCKS 
        and joining member mutually authenticate each other. If the 
         
         
        Internet Draft    Group Key Management Architecture          [PAGE 6] 
         
         
        Baugher, Canetti, Dondeti, Lindholm                         June 2003 
         
         
        authentication succeeds and the GCKS finds that the joining member is 
        authorized, then the GCKS supplies the joining member with the 
        following information: 
         
            (a) Sufficient information to initialize a "Re-key Protocol SA"  
        within the joining member (see more details about this SA  below). 
        This information is given only in case that the group security policy 
        calls for using a Re-key protocol. 
            (b) Sufficient information to initialize the Data Security  
        Protocol SA within the joining member. This information is given only 
        in the case that the group security policy calls for initializing the 
        Data Security Protocol SA at Registration, instead of or in addition 
        to at Re-key. 
         
          The Registration Protocol must ensure that the transfer of 
        information from GCKS to member is done in an authenticated and 
        confidential manner over a security association.  We call this SA the 
        "Registration Protocol SA". A complementary "De-registration 
        protocol" serves to explicitly remove Registration Protocol SA state.  
         
         
          (2) Re-key protocol. 
              ================ 
          This is an optional protocol where a GCKS periodically sends re-key 
        information to the group members. Re-key messages may result from 
        group membership changes, the creation of new traffic-encrypting keys 
        (TPKs, see next section) for the particular Group, or from key 
        expiration. Re-key messages are protected by the Re-key protocol SA, 
        which is initialized in the Registration protocol. The Re-key message 
        includes information for updating both the Re-key protocol SA and/or 
        the Data Security Protocol SA.  The Re-key messages can be sent via 
        multicast to group members or unicast from the GCKS to a particular 
        group member. 
         
        The Re-key protocol is optional as there are other means for managing 
        (e.g. expiring or refreshing) the keys locally without interaction 
        between the GCKS and member [MARKS].  The Re-key SA that is 
        established includes authentication data for the re-key.  There are 
        two cases.   
         
         o The first and primary option is to use source authentication. 
           That is, each group member verifies that Re-key data originates     
           with the GCKS and none other. 
         
         o The second option is to use only group-based authentication using  
           a symmetric key, such as a message authentication code.  Members 
           can only be assured that the Re-key messages originated within 
           the group.  Therefore, this is applicable only when all members  
           of the group are trusted not to impersonate the GCKS.  Group   
           authentication for Re-key messages is typically used when public-

           key cryptography is not suitable for the particular group. 
         
        The Re-key protocol ensures that all members receive the re-key 
        information in a timely manner. In addition, the Re-key protocol 
        specifies mechanisms for the parties to contact the GCKS and "re-
        synch" in case that their keys expired and an updated key has not yet 
        been received.  The Re-key protocol for large-scale groups offers 
        mechanisms to avoid implosion problems and ensure the needed 
        reliability in its delivery of keying material. 
         
        The Re-key message is protected by a Re-key SA, which is established 
        by the Registration Protocol.  It is a recommended practice that a 
        member who leaves the group destroys the Re-key SA, one or more Data 
        SAs, and the Registration SA to which these SAs belong. Use of a De-
        Registration message is often an efficient mechanisms for a member to 
        inform the GCKS that it has destroyed it SAs, or is about to destroy 
        them.  Such a message may prompt the GCKS to cryptographically 
        remove the member from the group (i.e., to prevent the member from 
        having access to future group communication). In large-scale 
        multicast applications, however, De-registration has the potential to 
        cause implosion at the GCKS.   
         
     3.2 Detailed description 
         
        Figure 1 depicts the overall design [HBH01].  Each group member, 
        sender or receiver, uses the Registration Protocol to get authorized, 
        authenticated access to a particular Group, its policies, and its 
        keys. The two types of group keys are the KEK (key-encrypting key) 
        and the Traffic Protection Keys or TPKs (TPKs refer to both Traffic 
        Encryption Keys or TPKs, and Traffic integrity protection keys).  The 
        KEK may be a single key that encrypts the TPKs or it may be a vector 
        of keys in a group key membership algorithm [RFC2627, OFT, CP00, 
        LNN01, SD] that encrypts the TPKs and other KEKs.  The KEK is used by 
        the Re-key protocol.  The TPKs are used by the Data Security Protocol 
        to protect streams, files, or other data sent and received by the 
        Data Security Protocol.  Thus the Registration Protocol and/or the 
        Re-key Protocol establish the KEK and the TPKs. 
         
         There are a few, distinct outcomes to a successful Registration 
        Protocol exchange. 
         
             o If the GCKS uses Re-key messages, then the admitted member 
               receives the Group KEK; if it uses a group key management 
               algorithm, then the member receives a set of KEKs according to 
               the particular algorithm. 
             o If Re-key messages are not used for the Group, then the 
               admitted member will receive TPKs (in SAs) that are passed to  
               the member's Data Security Protocol (as IKE does for IPsec). 
             o The GCKS may pass one or more TPKs to the member even if Re- 
               key messages are used, for efficiency reasons according to

                     FIGURE 1: Group Security Association Model 
         
         
        The GCKS creates the KEK and TPKs and downloads them to each member - 
        as the KEK and TPKs are common to the entire Group.  The GCKS is a 
        separate, logical entity that performs member authentication and 
        authorization according to the Group policy that is set by the Group 
        Owner.  The GCKS MAY present a credential to the Group member that is 
        signed by the Group Owner so the member can check the GCKS's 
        authorization.  The GCKS, which may be co-located with a member or be 
        a separate physical entity, runs the Re-key Protocol to push Re-key 
        messages of refreshed KEKs, new TPKs, and refreshed TPKs to members.  
        Alternatively, the sender may forward Re-key messages on behalf of 
        the GCKS when it uses a credential mechanism that supports 
        delegation. Thus, it is possible for the sender or other member to 
        source keying material (a TPKs encrypted in the Group KEK) as it 
        sources multicast or unicast data.  As mentioned above, the Re-key

        message can be sent using unicast or multicast delivery.  Upon 
        receipt of a TPKs from a Re-key Message or a Registration protocol 
        exchange, the member's group key management will provide a security 
        association (SA) to a Data Security Protocol for the data sent from 
        sender to receiver. 
         
         
        The "Security Protocol SA" protects the data sent on the arc labeled 
        "DATA SECURITY PROTOCOL" in Figure 1.  A second SA, the "Re-key 
        SA," is optionally established by the key-management protocol for Re-
        key messages, and the arc labeled "RE-KEY PROTOCOL" in Figure 1 
        depicts this.  The Re-key message is optional because all keys, KEK 
        and TPKs, can be delivered by the Registration Protocol exchanges 
        shown in Figure 1, and those keys may not need to be updated.  The 
        Registration Protocol is protected by a third, symmetric, unicast SA 
        between the GCKS and each member; this is called the "Registration 
        Protocol SA."  There may be no need for the Registration Protocol SA 
        to remain in place after the completion of the Registration Protocol 
        exchanges.  The De-registration protocol is also optional and is used 
        when explicit teardown or the SA is desirable (such as when a phone 
        call or conference terminates).  The three SAs comprise the Group 
        Security Association.  Only one SA is optional and that is the Re-key 
        SA.  
         
     Figure 1 shows two blocks that are external to the group key management 
     protocol:  The Policy and Authorization Infrastructures are discussed in 
     Section 6.1. 
      
         
     3.3 Properties of the design 
         
        The design of Section 3.2 achieves scalable operation by (1) allowing 
        the de-coupling of authenticated key exchange in a "Registration 
        Protocol" from a "Re-key Protocol," (2) allowing the Re-key Protocol 
        to use unicast push or multicast distribution of group and data keys 
        as an option, (3) allowing all keys to be obtained by the unicast 
        Registration Protocol, and (4) delegating the functionality of the 
        GCKS among multiple entities, i.e., permit distributed operation of 
        the GCKS. 
         
        High-capacity operation is obtained by (1) amortizing 
        computationally-expensive asymmetric cryptography over multiple data 
        keys used by data security protocols, (2) supporting unicast push or 
        multicast distribution of symmetric group and data keys, and (3) 
        supporting key revocation algorithms such as LKH [RFC2627, OFT, 
        LNN01] that allow members to be added or removed at logarithmic 
        rather than linear space/time complexity.  The Registration protocol 
        may use asymmetric cryptography to authenticate joining members and 
        optionally establish the group KEK.  Asymmetric cryptography such as 
        Diffie-Hellman key agreement and/or digital signatures are amortized

        over the life of the group KEK: A Data Security SA can be established 
        without the use of asymmetric cryptography - the TPKs are simply 
        encrypted in the symmetric KEK and sent unicast or multicast in the 
        Re-key protocol.   
         
        The design of the Registration and Re-key Protocols is flexible. The 
        Registration protocol establishes one KEK or multiple TPKs or both 
        KEK and TPKs.  The TPKs(or ôdata keyö) is associated with a data 
        security protocol SA; there may in fact be multiple keys pushed with 
        or derived from the TPKs.  The Re-key Protocol establishes KEKs or 
        TPKs or both.   
         
      
     3.4 Implementation Diagram 
         
        In the block diagram of Figure 2, group key management protocols run 
        between a GCKS and member principal to establish a Group Security 
        Association (GSA).  The GSA consists of a Security Protocol SA, an 
        optional Re-key SA, and a Registration Protocol SA.  The GCKS MAY use 
        a delegated principal, such as an SRTP [SRTP] sender, which has a 
        delegation credential signed by the GCKS.  The "Member" of Figure 2 
        may be a sender or receiver of multicast or unicast data [HCBD].  
        There are two functional blocks in Figure 2 labeled "GKM," and there 
        are two arcs between them depicting the group key-management 
        Registration ("reg") and Re-key ("rek") protocols.  The message 
        exchanges are the GSA establishment protocols, which are the 
        Registration Protocol and the Re-key Protocol described above. 
         
         
        Figure 2 shows that a complete group-key management functional 
        specification includes much more than the message exchange.  Some of 
        these functional blocks and the arcs between them are peculiar to an 
        operating system (OS) or vendor product, such as vendor 
        specifications for products that support updates to the IPsec 
        Security Association Database (SAD) and Security Policy Database 
        (SPD) [RFC2367].  Various vendors also define the functions and 
        interface of credential stores, "CRED" in Figure 2.   
         
         
        The CONTROL function directs the GCKS to establish a group, admit a 
        member or remove a member, or it directs a member to join or leave a 
        group.  CONTROL includes authorization, which is subject to Group 
        Policy [HH], but how this is done is specific to the GCKS 
        implementation.  CONTROL may be a telephony signaling protocol such 
        as SIP with the GCKS function operating on a caller's phone.  For 
        large-scale multicast sessions, CONTROL could perform session 
        announcement functions to inform a potential group member that it may 
        join a group or receive group data (e.g. a stream of file transfer 
        protected by a Data Security protocol).  Announcements notify group 
        members to establish multicast SAs in advance of secure multicast

        data transmission.  Session Description Protocol (SDP) is one form 
        that the announcements might take [RFC2327].  The announcement 
        function may be implemented in a session-directory tool, an 
        electronic program guide (EPG), or by other means.  The Data Security 
        or the announcement function directs group key management using an 
        application-programming interface (API), which is peculiar to the 
        host OS in its specifics.  A generic API for group key management is 
        for further study, but this function is necessary to allow Group 
        (KEK) and Data (TPKs) key establishment to be done in a way that is 
        scalable to the particular application.  A GCKS application program 
        will use the API to initiate the procedures to establish SAs on 
        behalf of a Security Protocol in which members join secure groups and 
        receive keys for streams, files or other data.

     4.0 Registration Protocol 
         
        The design of the Registration is flexible. The Registration 
        protocol establishes one Rekey SA or multiple Data Security SAs or 
        both Rekey and Data Security SAs.  Traffic protection keys (or "data 
        keys") associated with a data security protocol SA; there may in 
        fact be multiple keys pushed with or derived from the TPKs. A 
        particular group key management protocol MAY restrict these many 
        options according to its particular requirements. 
         
        Each registration protocol supports different scenarios. The chosen 
        registration protocol solution reflects the specific requirements of 
        specific scenarios. In principle, it is possible to base a 
        registration protocol on any secure-channel protocol, such as IPsec 
        and TLS, which is the case in GSAKMP [GSAKMP]. However, registration 
        protocols that address other scenarios, such as GDOI [GDOI] and 
        MIKEY [MIKEY], use other methods to secure SA establishment. Some of 
        the different solutions that arise from specific scenarios are 
        discussed in the sections below. This document also refers in more 
        detail to the specific registration protocols GDOI and MIKEY, and 
        shows how these fit within the general architecture.  
         
     4.1 Registration Protocol Message Exchange 
         
        Some registration protocols need "tunnel" through a data-signaling 
        protocol. The reason may e.g. be to take advantage of already 
        existing (security) functionality, and/or to optimize the total 
        session setup time. For example, a telephone call has strict bounds 
        for delay in setup time; we donÆt like to wait a second longer than 
        we have to. It is not feasible to run security exchanges in parallel 
        with call setup since the latter often resolves the address: Call 
        setup must complete before the caller knows the address of the 
        callee. A better solution is to tunnel the key exchange procedures 
        inside call establishment [H.235, MIKEY] so both can complete (or 
        fail, see below) at the same time. 
         
        The registration protocol has different requirements depending on 
        the particular integration/tunneling approach. These requirements 
        are not necessarily security requirements, but will have an impact 
        on the chosen security solution. For example, the security 
        association will certainly fail if the call setup fails in the case 
        of IP telephony. 
         
        Conversely, the registration protocol imposes requirements on the 
        protocol that tunnels it. In the case of IP telephony, the call 
        setup usually will fail when the security association is not 
        successfully established. In the case of video-on-demand, protocols 
        such as RTSP that convey key management data will fail when a needed 
        security association cannot be established.

        Both GDOI and MIKEY use this approach, but in different ways. MIKEY 
        can be tunneled in SIP and RTSP. It takes advantage of the session 
        information contained in these protocols and the possibility to 
        optimize the setup time for the registration procedure. SIP requires 
        that a tunneled protocol must use at most one roundtrip (i.e. two 
        messages). This is also desirable requirement from RTSP as well.  
         
        The GDOI approach takes advantage of the already defined ISAKMP 
        phase 1 exchange [RFC2409], and extends the phase 2 exchange for the 
        registration. This is a good example of reusing security 
        functionality, where the defined phase 2 exchange is protected by 
        the SA created by phase 1. The GDOI will also inherent other 
        functionality of the ISAKMP. This may e.g. make the solution very 
        suitable for running IPsec protocols over IP multicast services. 
         
         
     4.2 Properties of Alternative Registration Exchange Types 
         
        The required design properties of a registration protocol has 
        different tradeoffs. A protocol that provides perfect forward 
        secrecy and identity protection trades security for performance or 
        efficiency, while a protocol that completes in one or two messages 
        may trade security functionality (e.g. identity protection) for 
        efficiency. 
         
        In a one- or two-message protocol, replay protection generally uses 
        either a timestamp or a sequence number. The first requires 
        synchronized clocks, while the latter requires that it is possible 
        to keep state. In a timestamp-based protocol, a replay cache is 
        needed to store the messages (or the hashes of the messages) 
        received within the allowable "clock skew". The size of the replay 
        cache depends on the number of messages received during the 
        allowable clock skew. During a DoS attack, the replay cache might 
        become overloaded. One solution is to over provision the replay 
        cache. However, this may lead to a large replay cache. Another 
        solution is to let the allowable clock skew be changed dynamically 
        during runtime. During a suspected DoS attack, the allowable clock 
        skew is then decreased so that the replay cache becomes manageable. 
         
        A challenge-response mechanism (using Nonce) obviates the need for 
        synchronized clocks for replay protection when the exchange uses 
        three or more messages [MVV]. This does not guarantee the replay 
        protection of individual messages (unless the protocols record all 
        Nonce), but on the exchange itself. "Cookies", such as stateless 
        cookies are means to protect against the replay of individual 
        messages [Photuris]. 
         
        Additional security functions become possible as the number of 
        allowable messages in the registration protocol increase.  ISAKMP 
        offers identity protection, for example, as part of a six-message 
         
         
        Internet Draft    Group Key Management Architecture         [PAGE 14]

        exchange.  With additional security features, however, comes added 
        complexity:  Identity protection, for example, not only requires 
        additional messages, but may result in DoS vulnerabilities since 
        authentication is performed in a late stage of the exchange after 
        resources already have been devoted. 
         
        In all cases, there are tradeoffs with the number of message 
        exchanged, the desired security services, and the amount of 
        infrastructure that is needed to support the group key management 
        service.  Whereas protocols that use two or even one-message setup 
        have low latency and computation requirements, they may require more 
        infrastructure such as secure time or offer less security such as 
        the absence of identity protection.  What tradeoffs are acceptable 
        and what are not is very much dictated by the application and 
        application environment.   
         
         
     4.3 Infrastructure for Alternative Registration Exchange Types 
         
        The registration protocols need external infrastructures to be able 
        to handle authentication, replay protection, protocol-run integrity, 
        authorization and potentially other security services such as 
        secure, synchronized clocks. These may be solved by e.g. deploying a 
        PKI (with either authorization-based certificates or a separate 
        management for this). Other existing solutions may be employed such 
        as AAA infrastructure. Depending on the registration protocol and 
        its application, other external infrastructures may also be needed 
        e.g. timestamp-based protocols may need an infrastructure to 
        synchronize the clocks.  
         
        However, external infrastructures may not always be needed. This 
        could be the case when e.g. pre-shared keys are used and the 
        subscription base is very small. In a conversational multimedia 
        scenario (e.g. a VoIP call between two or more people), it may very 
        well be the end user who handles the authorization by manually 
        accepting/rejecting the incoming calls. 
         
        In general, protocols that use fewer messages require more 
        infrastructure (such as synchronized clocks) or fewer security 
        features such as PFS or identity protection.  
         
     4.2 De-Registration Exchange 
         
        The session-establishment protocol (e.g. SIP, RTSP) that conveys a 
        Registration exchange often has a session-disestablishment protocol 
        such as RTSP TEARDOWN [RFC2326] or SIP BYE [RFC2543]. The session-
        disestablishment exchange between endpoints offers an opportunity to 
        signal the end of the GSA state at the endpoints.  This "exchange" 
        need only be a uni-directional notification by one side that the GSA 
        is to be destroyed.  Authentication of this notification can use a 
         
         
        Internet Draft    Group Key Management Architecture         [PAGE 15]

        proof-of-possession of the group key(s) by one side to the other.  
        Some applications benefit from acknowledgement in a mutual, two-
        message exchange signaling disestablishment of the GSA concomitant 
        with disestablishment of the session, e.g. RTSP or SIP session.  In 
        this case, a two-way proof-of-possession might serve for mutual 
        acknowledgement of the GSA disestablishment.   
         
      
     5.0 Rekey protocol 
         
        Group Rekey protocol is for transport of keys and SAs between a GCKS 
        and the members of a secure communications group.  The GCKS sends 
        Rekey messages to update a Rekey SA, or initialize/update a Data 
        Security SA or both. Rekey messages are protected by a Rekey SA. The 
        GCKS may update the Rekey SA when group membership changes or when 
        KEKs or TPKs expire.  Recall that KEKs correspond to a Rekey SA and 
        TPKs correspond to a Data Security SA. 
         
        The following are some desirable properties of the Rekey protocol: 
         
          o Rekey protocol ensures that all members receive the rekey 
            information in a timely manner. 
         
          o Rekey protocol specifies mechanisms for the parties 
            involved, to contact the GCKS and re-sync when their keys expire 
            and no updates have been received. 
         
          o Rekey protocol avoids implosion problems and ensures the 
            needed reliability in delivering Rekey information. 
         
        We further note that the Rekey protocol is primarily responsible for 
        scalability of the group key management architecture.  Hence it is 
        imperative that we provide the above listed properties in a scalable 
        manner.  Note that solutions exist in the literature (both IETF 
        standards and research articles) for parts of the problem.  For 
        instance, the Rekey protocol may use a scalable group key management 
        algorithm (GKMA) to reduce the number of keys sent in a rekey 
        message. Examples of a GKMA include LKH, OFT, Subset difference based 
        schemes etc. 
      
     5.1 Goals of the Rekey protocol 
         
        The goals of the Rekey protocol are: 
         
             o to synchronize a GSA 
         
             o to provide privacy and (symmetric or asymmetric)        
               authentication,

             o efficient rekeying after changes in group membership, or when 
               keys (KEKs) expire, 
         
             o (optional) reliable delivery of rekey messages 
         
             o high throughput and low latency, and 
         
             o to use IP Multicast or multi-unicast. 
         
         
        We identify five major issues in the design of a rekey protocol: 
         
          1. rekey message format 
         
          2. reliable transport of rekey messages 
         
          3. implosion 
         
          4. incorporating GKMAs in rekey messages 
         
          5. interoperability of GKMAs 
         
        Note that for a GCKS to successfully rekey a group, it is not 
        sufficient that Rekey protocol implementations interoperate.  We also 
        need to ensure that the GKMA also interoperates. 
         
        In the rest of this section we discuss these issues in detail. 
         
     5.2 Rekey messages 
         
        Rekey messages are at the core of the rekey protocol.  They contain 
        Rekey and/or Data Security SAs along with KEKs and TPKs.  These 
        messages need to be confidential, authenticated, and protected 
        against replay attacks. 
         
        Rekey messages contain group key updates corresponding to a 
        single[LKH,OFT] or multiple membership changes[Subset, BatchRekey] 
        and often contain group key initialization messages [OFT]. 
         
            
     5.3 Reliable transport of rekey messages 
         
        The GCKS needs to ensure that all members have the current Data 
        Security and Rekey SAs.  Otherwise, authorized members may be 
        inadvertently excluded from receiving group communications.  Thus, 
        the GCKS needs to use a rekey algorithm that is inherently reliable 
        or employ some reliable transport mechanism to send rekey messages.  
         
        There are two dimensions to the problem:  Messages that update group 
        keys may be lost in transit or may be missed by a host when it is 
         
         
        Internet Draft    Group Key Management Architecture         [PAGE 17]

        offline.  LKH and OFT group key management algorithms rely on past 
        history of updates being received by the host.  If the host is 
        offline, then it will need to resynchronize its group-key state, 
        which probably requires a unicast exchange with the GCKS.  The 
        Subset Difference algorithm, however, conveys all needed state in 
        its re-key message and does not need members to be always on nor 
        always connected.  Subset difference does not require a backchannel 
        and can operate on a broadcast network.  Subset difference, however, 
        does need to have its key management message received by the member. 
         
        Thus Subset difference, LKH and OFT are not inherently reliable. 
        Reliable multicasting is a hard problem, but there are several 
        solutions in the literature.  We discuss reliable transport of rekey 
        messages in this section. 
         
        Rekey messages are typically short (for single membership change as 
        well as for small groups) which makes it easy to design a reliable 
        delivery protocol.  On the other hand, the security requirements 
        may add an additional dimension to address.  Also there are some 
        special cases where membership changes are processed as a batch, 
        which reduces the frequency of rekey messages, but increases their 
        size.  Furthermore, among all the KEKs sent in a rekey message, 
        as many as half the members need only a single KEK.  We need to take 
        advantage of these properties in designing a rekey message(s) and 
        a protocol for their reliable delivery. 
         
        Three categories of solutions have been proposed: 
         
          1. Repeatedly transmit the rekey message:  Recall that in many   
             cases rekey messages translate to only one or two IP packets. 
         
          2. Use an existing reliable multicast protocol/infrastructure 
         
          3. Use FEC for encoding rekey packets (with NACKs as  
             feedback) [BatchRekey] 
         
        Note that for small messages, category 3 is essentially the same as 
        category 1. 
         
         
     5.4 Implosion 
         
        Implosion may occur due to one of two reasons.  First, recall that 
        one of the goals of the rekey protocol is to "synchronize a GSA."  
        When a rekey or data security SA expires, members may contact the 
        GCKS for an update.  If all or even many members contact the GCKS at 
        about the same time, the GCKS cannot handle all those messages.  We 
        refer to this as an "out-of-sync implosion." 
         

         
         
        Internet Draft    Group Key Management Architecture         [PAGE 18] 
         
         
        Baugher, Canetti, Dondeti, Lindholm                         June 2003 
         
         
        The second case is in the reliable delivery of rekey messages.  
        Reliable multicast protocols use feedback (NACK or ACK) to determine 
        which packets must be retransmitted.  Packet losses may result in 
        many members sending NACKs to the GCKS.  We refer to this as feedback 
        implosion. 
         
        The implosion problem has been studied extensively in the context of  
        reliable multicasting.  Some of the proposed solutions viz., feedback 
        suppression and aggregation, might be useful in this context as well. 
         
        The GCKS might send each receiver a random number to be used as time 
        to wait before sending a NACK or out-of-sync message.  Meanwhile, 
        members might receive the key updates they need and therefore will 
        not send a feedback message. 
         
        An alternative solution is to have the members contact one of several 
        registration servers when they are out-of-sync.  This results in  
        repetition of the registration process for those members.  
        Furthermore, there is the need to setup multiple registration servers 
        and synchronize them. 
         
        Feedback aggregation and local recovery employed by some reliable  
        multicast protocols are not easily adaptable to transport of rekey  
        messages.  There are authentication issues to address in aggregation. 
        Local recovery is more complex in that members need to establish SAs 
        with the local repair server. 
      
     5.5  Issues in incorporating group key management algorithms 
         
        Group key management algorithms make re-keying scalable. Large group 
        re-keying without employing GKMAs is prohibitively expensive. 
         
        First we list some requirements to consider in selecting a GKMA: 
         
          o Collusion:  Members (or non members) should not be able to  
            collaborate to deduce keys that they are not privileged  
           (following the GKMA key distribution rules) to. 
         
          o Forward access control: Ensure that departing members cannot get  
            access to future group data. 
         
          o Backward access control:  Ensure that joining members cannot  
            decrypt past data. 
         
     5.5.1 Stateless vs. stateful rekeying 
         
        We classify group key management algorithms into two categories, 
        viz., stateful and stateless algorithms. 
         

         
         
        Internet Draft    Group Key Management Architecture         [PAGE 19]

        Stateful algorithms use KEKs from the ith rekeying instance to 
        encrypt (protect) KEKS corresponding to the i+1st rekeying instance.  
        The main disadvantage in these schemes is that if a member was 
        offline or otherwise fails to receive KEKs from a rekeying instance 
        i, it can no longer synchronize its GSA even though it can receive 
        KEKs from all future rekeying instances starting at i+1.  The only 
        solution is to contact the GCKS explicitly for resynchronization.  
         
        Note that the KEKs for the first rekeying instance are protected by 
        the registration SA.  Recall that communication in that phase is one 
        to one, and therefore it is easy to ensure reliable delivery. 
         
        Stateless GKMAs encrypt rekey messages with KEKs sent during the 
        registration protocol.  Since rekey messages are independent of any 
        past rekey messages (i.e. not protected by KEKs therein), a member 
        may go offline, but continue to be able to decipher future 
        communications.  The catch however is that members can never decrypt 
        any messages sent while they were offline, even though there are 
        eligible to (i.e. paid for that content as well).  Stateless rekeying 
        may be relatively inefficient, particularly for immediate (in 
        contrast to batch) rekeying in highly dynamic groups. 
         
     5.6 Interoperability of a GKMA 
         
        Most GKMA specifications do not specify packet formats although any 
        group key management algorithms needs to for the purposes of 
        interoperability.  In particular there are several alternative ways 
        to managing key trees and numbering nodes within key trees.  The 
        following information is generally needed during initialization of a 
        rekey SA or included with each GKMA packet. 
         
          o GKMA name  (e.g. LKH, OFT, Subset difference) 
         
          o GKMA version number (implementation specific).  Version may imply 
            several things such as the degree of a key tree, proprietary  
            enhancements, and qualify another field such as a key id. 
         
          o Number of keys or Largest ID 
         
          o Version specific data 
         
          o Per key information 
         
             - Key ID 
         
             - Key lifetime (creation/expiration data) 
         
             - Encrypted key 
         
             - encryption key's ID (optional)

        Key IDs may change in some implementations in which case we need to 
        send: 
         
          o  List of <old id, new id> 
         
         
     6.0 Group Security Association 
         
        The GKM Architecture defines the interfaces between the Registration, 
        Re-key, and Data Security protocols in terms of the Security 
        Associations (SAs) of those protocols.  By isolating these protocols 
        behind a uniform interface, our architecture allows implementations 
        to use protocols best suited to their needs.  For example, a Re-key 
        protocol for a small group could use multiple unicast transmissions 
        with symmetric authentication, while that for a large group could use 
        IP Multicast with packet-level Forward Error Correction and source 
        authentication. 
         
        The Group Key Management Architecture provides an interface between 
        the security protocols and the group SA (GSA), which consists of 
        three SAs, viz., Registration SA, Re-key SA and Data SA.  The Re-key 
        SA is optional.  There are two cases in defining the relationships 
        between the three SAs.  In both cases, the Registration SA protects 
        the Registration protocol. 
         
        In Case 1, Group key management is done WITHOUT using a Re-key SA. 
        The Registration protocol initializes and updates one or more Data 
        SAs (having TPKs to protect files or streams).  Each Data SA 
        corresponds to a single group û and a group may have more than one 
        data SA.   
         
        In Case 2, group key management USES a Re-key SA to protect the Re-
        key protocol. The Registration protocol initializes the Re-key SAs 
        (one or more) as well as zero or more Data SAs upon successful 
        completion.  When a Data SA is not initialized in the Registration 
        protocol, this is done in the Re-key protocol.  The Re-key protocol 
        updates Re-key SA(s) AND establishes Data SA(s). 
         
     6.1 Group policy 
         
        Group-policy is currently being defined [GSPT].  It can be 
        distributed through announcement, key management protocols, and other 
        means.  The group key management protocol carries cryptographic 
        policies of the SA keys it establishes as well as additional policies 
        for the group as well. 
         
        The acceptable cryptographic policies for the Registration Protocol, 
        which may run over TLS, IPsec, or IKE, are not conveyed in the group 
        key-management protocol since they precede any of the key management

        exchanges.  Thus, a security policy repository having some access 
        protocol may need to be queried prior to key-management session 
        establishment to determine what the initial cryptographic policies 
        are for that establishment.  This document assumes the existence of 
        such a repository and protocol for GCKS and member policy queries. 
        Thus group security policy will be represented in a policy repository 
        and accessible using a policy protocol. 
         
        This memo assumes that at least the following group-policy 
        information is externally managed. 
         
          o Group owner, authentication method, and delegation method for  
            identifying a GCKS for the group 
          o Group GCKS, authentication method, and any method used for 
            delegating other GCKSs for the group 
          o Group membership rules or list and authentication method 
         
        There are also two additional policy-related requirements external to 
        group key management. 
         
          o There is an authorization and authentication infrastructure such 
            as X.509, SPKI, or pre-shared key scheme in accordance with the 
            group policy for a particular group. 
          o There is an announcement mechanism for secure groups and events 
            that operates according to group policy for a particular group. 
         
        Group policy determines how the Registration and Re-key protocols 
        initialize or update Re-key and Data SAs.  The following sections 
        describe the information that is sent by the GCKS for the Re-key and 
        Data SAs.  A member needs to have the information specified in the 
        next sections to establish Re-key and Data SAs. 
         
     6.2 Contents of the Re-key SA 
         
        The Re-key SA protects the Re-key protocol.  It contains 
        cryptographic policy, Security Parameter Index (SPI) [RFC2401] to 
        uniquely identify an SA, replay protection information, and secret 
        keys. 
         
     6.2.1 Re-key SA policy 
         
        The MEMBERSHIP MANAGEMENT ALGORITHM represents the group key 
        revocation algorithm that enforces forward and backward access 
        control.  Examples of key revocation algorithms include LKH, LKH+, 
        OFT, OFC and Subset Difference [RFC2627, OFT, CP00, LNN01].  The key 
        revocation algorithm could also be NULL.  In that case, the Re-key SA 
        contains only one KEK, which serves as the group KEK.  The Re-key 
        messages initialize or update Data SAs as usual.  But, the Re-key SA 
        itself can be updated (group KEK can be re-keyed) when members join 

         
         
        Internet Draft    Group Key Management Architecture         [PAGE 22]

        or the KEK is about to expire.  Leave re-keying is done by re-
        initializing the Re-key SA through the Re-key Protocol. 
         
        The KEK ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM uses a standard encryption algorithm 
        such as 3DES or AES.  The KEK KEY LENGTH is also specified. 
         
        The AUTHENTICATION ALGORITHM uses digital signatures for GCKS 
        authentication (since all shared secrets are known to some or all 
        members of the group), or some symmetric secret in computing MACs for 
        group authentication.  Symmetric authentication provides weaker 
        authentication in that any group member can impersonate a particular 
        source.  The AUTHENTICATION KEY LENGTH is also be specified. 
         
        The CONTROL GROUP ADDRESS is used for multicast transmission of Re-
        key messages.  This information is sent over the control channel such 
        as in an ANNOUNCEMENT protocol or call setup message. The degree to 
        which the control group address is protected is a matter of group 
        policy.  
         
        The REKEY SERVER ADDRESS allows the registration server to be a 
        different entity from the server used for re-key, such as for future 
        invocations of the Registration and Re-key protocols.  If the 
        registration server and the re-key server are two different entities, 
        the registration server sends the re-key server's address as part of 
        the Re-key SA. 
         
     6.2.2 Group identity 
         
        The Group identity accompanies the SA (payload) information as an 
        identifier if the specific group key management protocol allows 
        multiple groups to be initialized in a single invocation of the 
        Registration protocol or multiple groups to be updated in a single 
        Re-key message.  It is often much simpler to restrict each 
        Registration invocation to a single group, this Group Key Management 
        Architecture mandates no such restriction.  There is always a need to 
        identify the group when establishing a Re-key SA either implicitly 
        through an SPI or explicitly as an SA parameter. 
         
     6.2.3 Key encrypting key(s) 
         
        Corresponding to the key management algorithm, the Re-key SA contains 
        one or more KEKs.  The GCKS holds the key encrypting keys of the 
        group, while the members receive keys following the specification of 
        the key-management algorithm.  When there are multiple KEKs for a 
        group (as in an LKH tree), each KEK needs to be associated with a Key 
        ID, which is used to identify the key needed to decrypt it.  Each KEK 
        has a LIFETIME associated with it, after which the KEK expires. 
         
     6.2.4 Authentication key 
         
         
         
        Internet Draft    Group Key Management Architecture         [PAGE 23] 
         
         
        Baugher, Canetti, Dondeti, Lindholm                         June 2003 
         
         
        The GCKS provides a symmetric or public key for authentication of its 
        Re-key messages.  Symmetric-key authentication is appropriate only 
        when all group members can be trusted not to impersonate the GCKS.  
        The architecture does not rule out methods for deriving symmetric 
        authentication keys at the member [RFC2409] rather than being pushed 
        from the GCKS. 
         
     6.2.5 Replay protection information 
         
        Re-key messages need to be protected from replay/reflection attacks.  
        Sequence numbers are used for this purpose and the Re-key SA (or 
        protocol) contains this information. 
         
     6.2.6 Security Parameter Index (SPI) 
         
        The triple (Group identity, SPI, an identifier for "Re-key SA") 
        uniquely identifies an SA.  The SPI changes each time the KEKs 
        change. 
         
     6.3 Contents of the Data SA  
         
        The GCKS specifies the Data Security protocol used for secure 
        transmission of data from sender(s) to receiving members.  Examples 
        of Data Security protocols include IPsec ESP, SRTP, MESP, and AMESP.  
        While the content of each of these protocols is out of the scope of 
        this document, we list the information sent by the Registration 
        protocol (or the Re-key Protocol) to initialize or update the Data 
        SA. 
         
     6.3.1 Group identity 
         
        The Group identity accompanies SA information when Data SAs are 
        initialized or re-keyed for multiple groups in a single invocation of 
        the Registration protocol or in a single Re-key message (see 4.2.2).  
         
     6.3.2 Source identity 
         
        The SA includes source identity information when the Group Owner 
        chooses to reveal Source identity to authorized members only.  A 
        public channel such as announcement protocol is only appropriate when 
        there is no need to protect source or group identities. 
         
     6.3.3 Traffic encrypting key  
         
        Irrespective of the Data Security Protocol used, the GCKS supplies 
        the TPKs (or information to derive TPKs) used in secure data 
        transmission, source and group authentication. 
         
     6.3.4 Authentication key

        Depending on the data-authentication method used by the Data Security 
        protocol, group key management may pass one or more keys, functions 
        (e.g., TESLA), or other parameters used for authenticating streams or 
        files. 
         
     6.3.5 Sequence numbers 
         
        The GCKS passes sequence numbers when needed by the Data Security 
        protocol, for replay protection. 
         
     6.3.6 Security Parameter Index (SPI) 
         
        The GCKS sends provides an identifier as part of the Data SA contents 
        for data security protocols that use an SPI or similar mechanism to 
        identify an SA or keys within an SA. 
         
     6.3.7 Data SA policy 
      
        The Data SA parameters are specific to the Data Security Protocol but 
        generally include encryption algorithm and parameters, the source 
        authentication algorithm and parameters, the group authentication 
        algorithm and parameters, and/or replay protection information.  
        Generally, specification of source or group authentication is 
        mutually exclusive. 
         
     7.0 Scalability Considerations 
         
        Group communications is quite diverse.  In commercial 
        teleconferencing, a multipoint control unit (MCU) may be used to 
        aggregate a number of teleconferencing members into a single session; 
        MCUs may be hierarchically organized as well.  A "loosely coupled" 
        teleconferencing session [RFC 1889] has no central controller but is 
        fully distributed and end-to-end.  Teleconferencing sessions tend to 
        have at most dozens of participants whereas video broadcast, which 
        uses multicast communications, and media on demand, which uses 
        unicast, are large-scale groups numbering hundreds to millions of 
        participants.   
         
        As described in the Requirements section above, the group key 
        management architecture supports source-specific multicast.  One-to-
        many (single-sender) applications are well suited to source-specific 
        multicast, which tend to have large numbers of participants and 
        problems with synchronization among the participants.  Flash crowds  
        are one manifestation of the problem with synchronized participants 
        who make concurrent request for group data with concomitant requests 
        for secure group keys.  Thus, a group key management protocol 
        designed for single-source multicast applications must support large-
        scale operation.  The architecture described in this paper supports 
        large-scale operation through the following features. 
         
         
         
        Internet Draft    Group Key Management Architecture         [PAGE 25]

        1. There is no need for a unicast exchange to provide data keys to a 
        security protocol for members who have previously-registered in the 
        particular group; data keys can be pushed in the Re-key protocol. 
         
        2. The Registration and Re-key protocols are separable to allow 
        flexibility in how members get group secrets.  A group can use a 
        smart-card based system in place of the Registration protocol, for 
        example, to allow the Re-key protocol to be used with no back channel 
        for broadcast applications such as television conditional access 
        systems. 
         
        3. The Registration and Re-key protocols support new keys, 
        algorithms, authorization infrastructures and authentication 
        mechanisms in the architecture.  When the authorization 
        infrastructure supports delegation, as does X.509 and SPKI, the GCKS 
        function can be distributed as shown in Figure 3.

        The first feature in the list allows fast keying of Data Security 
        protocols when the member already belongs to the group.  While this 
        is realistic for subscriber groups and customers of service providers 
        who offer content events, it may be too restrictive for applications 
        that allow member enrollment at the time of the event.  The recourse 
        for handling member registration in the context of a "flash crowd" is 
        Figure 3, which will require the use of many GCKSs to accommodate the 
        load.  The Figure 3 configuration may be needed when conventional 
        clustering and load-balancing solutions of a central GCKS site cannot 
        meet customer requirements.  Unlike conventional caching and content-
        distribution networks, however, the configuration shown in Figure 3 
        has additional security ramifications for physical security of a 
        GCKS. 
         
        More analysis and work needs to be done on the protocol 
        instantiations of the Group Key Management architecture to determine 
        how effectively and securely the architecture can operate in large-
        scale environments such as source-specific multicast and video on 
        demand.  Specifically, the requirements for a Figure 3 configuration 
        must be determined such as the need for additional protocols between 
        the GCKS designated by the Group Owner and GCKSs that have been 
        delegated to serve keys on behalf of the designated GCKS. 
         
      
     8.0 GKM protocolsÆ applicability 
         
        Several protocols for group key management have been proposed at the 
        IETF. A few of them are already RFCs (e.g., GKMP) and a few others 
        are on their way to become RFCs.  Three protocols, viz., GDOI, 
        GSAKMP, MIKEY, are expected to become standards track RFCs.  In this 
        section, we discuss the applicability of these protocols to real-
        world applications. 
         
        A common theme to group key management protocols proposed at the IETF 
        is that they all facilitate "download" or push of a common key from a 
        server to a member.  The data security SA (or the rekey SA, where 
        applicable) is not negotiated, but unilaterally selected by the GCKS. 
         
        Key download must be protected from eavesdropping, and from active 
        attacks such as message modification, MiTM, and replay attacks.  
        Different protocols may use different mechanisms to provide these 
        security features, and not all may provide all features.  Next, 
        operational environments have a number of expectations on key 
        distribution protocols.  For example, the unicast key exchange 
        protocol, IKE, supports remote legacy authentication, and client 
        configuration (e.g., IP address assignment).  The end goal is to 
        establish a data security SA and an optional rekey SA.  Another 
        requirement is to finish in fewest round trips for efficient 
        operation.  Optionally, protocols may provide protection against 
        identity attacks and denial of service attacks.

     8.1 GDOI 
         
        GDOI is based on ISAKMP model of key establishment.  In Phase 1, the 
        DOI field indicates the nature of the protocol, viz., group key 
        download.  Other than that there is no change to ISAKMP Phase 1; 
        using main/aggressive mode, a secure channel is established using an 
        authenticated DH exchange.  At the end of the exchange an IKE SA is 
        established.  The member is expected to request to join a group, 
        optionally prove its authorization to join the group, and prove the 
        liveness of the exchange.  Under the protection of the IKE SA, the 
        GCKS downloads the rekey SA and the data security SAs to the member. 
         
        GDOI has a rekey exchange to update the rekey and/or the data 
        security SAs.  The data security SA can be an IPsec SA or an SRTP SA. 
         
     8.1.1 GDOI's Applicability: 
         
         
        GDOI is similar to IKE, owing to the fact that both are derived from 
        ISAKMP.  Thus any proposed/deployed/standardized extensions to IKE 
        may generally work for GDOI as well.  For example, GDOI supports the 
        use of pre-shared keys for end-point authentication, NAT traversal, 
        and client configuration.  GDOI policy download capabilities are 
        similar to that of ISAKMP/IKE.  In addition to IPsec policy, the GCKS 
        may download rekey SA and rekey algorithm (e.g., LKH, SDR) policy. 
        GDOI assumes that there is a single GCKS that downloads keys to any 
        number of members.  Multiple servers may be used to provide the GCKS 
        service, but they would all serve the same membership.  Subordinate 
        GCKSs serving subgroups is not supported in GDOI. 
         
        GDOI's Phase 1 provides all of the listed security features earlier; 
        however it requires too many round trips (Aggressive mode requires 
        1.5 + 2 round trips; and main mode requires 3 + 2 round trips in 
        providing identity protection) compared to the other two protocols.  
        Some of the additional complexity is due to the rich feature set; 
        however ISAKMPÆs model of establishing a secure tunnel before 
        downloading the rekey and data security SAs is also responsible for 
        the complexity. 
         
      
     8.2 GSAKMP 
         
         
        GSAKMP uses an authenticated (using digital signatures) DH exchange, 
        downloads keys and a policy token, and supports the concept of a 
        member ACK for auditing or billing purposes.  The policy token can be 
        transformed into a data security SA, such as an IPsec SA (and perhaps 

         
         
        Internet Draft    Group Key Management Architecture         [PAGE 28] 
         
         
        Baugher, Canetti, Dondeti, Lindholm                         June 2003 
         
         
        an SRTP SA).  GSAKMP assumes controlled operational environments and 
        supports DoS avoidance as an optional feature. 
         
        GSAKMP supports the concept of subordinate GCKSs and allows members 
        to be authorized as GCKSs.  GSAKMP does not have provisions to 
        support PSKs and identity protection (active or passive).  The policy 
        token needs to be translated into an IPsec SA, which is out of scope 
        of the document.  GSAKMP requires fewer RTs compared to GDOI, and 
        allows members to be designated as SGCKSs.  GSAKMP requires only 1.5 
        round trips, however the efficiency comes at the expense of lack of 
        DoS protection and lack of support for legacy client authentication 
        methods. 
         
     8.2.1 tGSAKMP <to be added> 
         
         
     8.3 MIKEY 
         
         
        MIKEY provides a single message key download using preshared keys or 
        public keys.  It is designed for peer-to-peer key download, or key 
        download for small one-many or many-to-many interactive groups.  It 
        defines a registration SA and a data security SA only; MIKEY does not 
        specify a rekey SA. 
         
        MIKEY also supports key download using DH exchange via a single RTT 
        exchange. Replay protection is provided using timestamps, to keep the 
        latency low.  MIKEY is specifically designed for multimedia call 
        setup, where low latency is a requirement.  MIKEY cannot seem to be 
        sufficient for general purpose group key management. GDOI or GSAKMP 
        should be used instead. 
         
         
     9.0 Security Considerations 
         
        This memo describes MSEC key management architecture.  This 
        architecture will be instantiated in one or more group key management 
        protocols, which must be protected against man-in-the-middle, 
        connection hijacking, replay or reflection of past messages, and 
        denial of service attacks. 
         
        Authenticated key exchange [STS, SKEME, RFC2408, RFC2412, RFC2409] 
        techniques limit the effects of man-in-the-middle and connection-
        hijacking attacks.  Sequence numbers and low-computation message 
        authentication techniques can be effective against replay and 
        reflection attacks. Cookies [RFC2522], when properly implemented, 
        provide an efficient means to reduce the effects of denial of service 
        attacks.

        Baugher, Canetti, Dondeti, Lindholm                         June 2003 
         
         
        This memo does not address attacks against key management or security 
        protocol implementations such as so-called "type attacks" that aim to 
        disrupt an implementation by such means as buffer overflow.  The 
        focus of this memo is on securing the protocol, not an implementation 
        of the protocol. 
         
        While classical techniques of authenticated key exchange can be 
        applied to group key management, new problems arise with the sharing 
        of secrets among a group of members:  Group secrets may be disclosed 
        by a member of the group and group senders may be impersonated by 
        other members of the group.  Key management messages from the GCKS 
        should not be authenticated using shared symmetric secrets unless all 
        members of the group can be trusted not to impersonate the GCKS.  
        Similarly, members who disclose group secrets undermine the security 
        of the entire group. Group Owners and GCKS administrators must be 
        aware of these inherent limitations of group key management. 
         
        Another limitation of group key management is policy complexity:  
        Whereas peer-to-peer security policy is an intersection of the policy 
        of the individual peers, a Group Owner sets group security policy 
        externally in secure groups.  This document assumes there is no 
        negotiation of cryptographic or other security parameters in group 
        key management.  Group security policy, therefore, poses new risks to 
        members who send and receive data from secure groups.  Security 
        administrators, GCKS operators, and users need to determine minimal 
        acceptable levels of trust, authenticity and confidentiality when 
        joining secure groups. 
        Given the limitations and risks of group security, the security of 
        the group key management Registration protocol should be as good as 
        the base protocols on which it is developed such as IKE, IPsec, TLS, 
        or SSL.  The particular instantiations of this Group Key Management 
        architecture must ensure that the high standards for authenticated 
        key exchange are preserved in their protocol specifications, which 
        will be Internet standards-track documents that are subject to 
        review, analysis and testing. 
         
        The second protocol, the group key management Re-key protocol, is new 
        and has unknown risks associated with it.  The source-authentication 
        risks describe above are obviated by the use of public-key 
        cryptography.  The use of multicast delivery may raise additional 
        security issues such as reliability, implosion, and denial of service 
        attacks based upon the use of multicast.  The Re-key protocol 
        specification (see Appendix A for the drafts roadmap) needs to offer 
        secure solutions to these problems.  Each instantiation of the Re-key 
        protocol, such as the GSAKMP Re-key or the GDOI Groupkey-push 
        operations, need to validate the security of their Re-key 
        specifications. 
         
        Novelty and complexity are the biggest risks to group key management 
        protocols.  Much more analysis and experience are needed to ensure

        that the architecture described in this document can provide a well-
        articulate standard for security and risks of group key management.
