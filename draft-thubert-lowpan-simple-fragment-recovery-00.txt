Abstract

   Considering that 6LoWPAN packets can be as large as 2K bytes and that
   an 802.15.4 frame with security will carry in the order of 80 bytes
   of effective payload, a packet might end up fragmented into as many
   as 25 fragments at the 6LoWPAN shim layer.  If a single one of those
   fragments is lost in transmission, all fragments must be resent,
   further contributing to the congestion that might have caused the
   initial packet loss.  This draft introduces a simple protocol to
   recover individual fragments between 6LoWPAN endpoints.

1.  Introduction

   Considering that 6LoWPAN packets can be as large as 2K bytes and that
   a 802.15.4 frame with security will carry in the order of 80 bytes of
   effective payload, a packet might be fragmented into about 25
   fragments at the 6LoWPAN shim layer.  This level of fragmentation is
   much higher than that traditionally experienced over the Internet
   with IPv4 fragments.  At the same time, the use of radios increases
   the probability of transmission loss and Mesh-Under techniques
   compound that risk over multiple hops.

   Past experience with fragmentation has shown that missassociated or
   lost fragments can lead to poor network behaviour and, eventually,
   trouble at application layer.  The reader might start his research
   from [I-D.mathis-frag-harmful] and follow the references.  That
   experience led to the definition of the Path MTU discovery [RFC1191]
   protocol that avoids fragmentation over the Internet.

   An end-to-end fragment recovery mechanism might be a good complement
   to a hop-by-hop MAC level recovery with a limited number of retries.
   This draft introduces a simple protocol to recover individual
   fragments between 6LoWPAN endpoints.  Specifically in the case of
   UDP, valuable additional information can be found in UDP Usage
   Guidelines for Application Designers [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-guidelines].


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Readers are expected to be familiar with all the terms and concepts
   that are discussed in "IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area
   Networks (6LoWPANs): Overview, Assumptions, Problem Statement, and
   Goals" [RFC4919] and "Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE 802.15.4
   Networks" [RFC4944].

   LoWPAN endpoints

      The LoWPAN nodes in charge of generating or expanding a 6LoWPAN
      header from/to a full IPv6 packet.  The LoWPAN endpoints are the
      points where fragmentation and reassembly take place.

3.  Rationale

   There are a number of usages for large packets in Wireless Sensor
   Networks.  Such usages may not be the most typical or represent the
   largest amount of traffic over the LoWPAN; however, the associated
   functionality can be critical enough to justify extra care for
   ensuring effective transport of large packets across the LoWPAN.

   The list of those usages includes:

   Towards the LoWPAN node:

      Packages of Commands:  A number of commands or a full
         configuration can by packaged as a single message to ensure
         consistency and enable atomic execution or complete roll back.
         Until such commands are fully received and interpreted, the
         intended operation will not take effect.

      Firmware update:  For example, a new version of the LoWPAN node
         software is downloaded from a system manager over unicast or
         multicast services.  Such a reflashing operation typically
         involves updating a large number of similar 6LoWPAN nodes over
         a relatively short period of time.

   From the LoWPAN node:

      Waveform captures:  A number of consecutive samples are measured
         at a high rate for a short time and then transferred from a
         sensor to a gateway or an edge server as a single large report.

      Large data packets:  Rich data types might require more than one
         fragment.

   Uncontrolled firmware download or waveform upload can easily result
   in a massive increase of the traffic and saturate the network.  When
   a fragment is lost in transmission, all fragments are resent, further
   contributing to the congestion that caused the initial loss, and
   potentially leading to congestion collapse.

   This saturation may lead to excessive radio interference, or random
   early discard (leaky bucket) in relaying nodes.  Additional queueing
   and memory congestion may result while waiting for a low power next
   hop to emerge from its sleeping state.


4.  Requirements

   This paper proposes a method to recover individual fragments between

Internet-Draft       LoWPAN simple fragment Recovery       February 2008


   LoWPAN endpoints.  The method is designed to fit the following
   requirements of a LoWPAN (with or without a Mesh-Under routing
   protocol):

   Controlled latency

      The ERP mechanism must succeed or give up within the time boundary
      imposed by the recovery process of the Upper Layer Protocols.

   Minimimum acknowledgement overhead

      Because the radio is inherently half duplex, an acknowledgement
      consumes roughly as many resources as the fragment itself.

   Support for out-of-order fragment delivery

      A Mesh-Under load balancing mechanism such as the ISA100 Data Link
      Layer can introduce out-of-sequence packets.  The recovery
      mechanism must account for packets that appear lost but are
      actually only delayed over a different path.

   Optional flow control

      The aggregation of multiple concurrent flows may lead to the
      saturation of the radio network and congestion collapse.

   Backward compatibility

      A node that implements this draft should be able to communicate
      with a node that implements [RFC4944].  The current draft assumes
      that compatibility information about the remote LoWPAN endpoint is
      obtained by external means.


5.  Overview

   The fragmentation/reassembly of a packet must complete within an
   acceptable overall latency, otherwise the packet expires and must be
   dropped.  This latency must be smaller than Upper Layer Protocol
   retry values, and smaller than expiration period of the information
   transported.

   The sender transfers a controlled number of fragments (possibly all
   of them) and flags the last fragment of a series with an
   Acknowledgement request.

   The sender sets a retry timer for the fragment that carries the
   Acknowledgement request.  That fragment is retransmitted individually



Thubert                  Expires August 10, 2008                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft       LoWPAN simple fragment Recovery       February 2008


   upon time out.  This is repeated until an Acknowledgement comes back
   or the packet expires.

   Upon receipt of an Acknowledgement request, the receiver responds
   with an Acknowledgement containing a bitmap that indicates which
   fragments were actually received.  The bitmap is a 32bit DWORD, which
   accommodates up to 32 fragments and is sufficient for the 6LoWPAN
   MTU.  For all n in [0..31], bit n is set to 1 in the bitmap to
   indicate that fragment n was received, otherwise the bit is set to 0.
   If any fragment immmediately preceding the acknowledgement request is
   missing, the receiver MAY intentionally delay its response to allow
   in-transit fragments to arrive.

   The sender has either one or no Acknowledgement pending.  An
   Acknowledgement that is not expected or does not acknowledge the
   pending sequence in the bitmap is a duplicate and is ignored.

   When a valid Acknowledgement is received, the sender resumes sending
   fragments and the process is repeated until all fragments are
   acknowledged or the packet expires.

   Fragments are sent in a round robin fashion: the sender sends all the
   fragments for a first time before it retries any lost fragment; lost
   fragments are retried in sequence, oldest first.  This mechanism
   enables the receiver to acknowledge fragments that were delayed in
   the network before they are actually retried.

   It is up to the sender to decide how many fragments are (re)sent
   before an acknowledgement is received, and the sender can adapt that
   number to the network conditions.  This way, the number of
   outstanding fragments can be used as a flow control mechanism to
   protect the network.


6.  New Dispatch types and headers

   This specification extends "Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE
   802.15.4 Networks" [RFC4944] with 3 new dispatch types, for
   Recoverable Fragments (RFRAG) headers with or without Acknowledgement
   Request, and for the Acknowledgement back.



            Pattern    Header Type
          +------------+-----------------------------------------------+

          | 11  101001 | RFRAG-AR   - RFRAG with Acknowledgement Req   |
          | 11  101010 | RFRAG-ACK  - RFRAG Acknowledgement            |

   Acknowledgement Bitmap

      Each bit in the Bitmap refers to a particular fragment: bit n set
      indicates that fragment with sequence n was received, for n in
      [0..31].  All zeroes means that the fragment was dropped because
      it corresponds to an obsolete datagram_tag.  This happens if the
      packet was already reassembled and passed to the network upper
      layer, or the packet expired and was dropped.


7.  Security Considerations

   The process of recovering fragments does not appear to create any
   opening for new threat.


8.  IANA Considerations

   Need extensions for formats defined in "Transmission of IPv6 Packets
   over IEEE 802.15.4 Networks" [RFC4944]. ?  Is that IANA ?.
