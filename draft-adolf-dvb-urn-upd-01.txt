1.  Introduction

   [RFC5328] registered the Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace "dvb"
   for the Digital Video Broadcasting Project.  Since the publication of
   that RFC, the registrant contact information has changed, and this
   document updates the registrant information to make it current.  It
   uses a role-based email address, to reduce the need for updates in
   the future.

2.  Registration Update

   This replaces the "Registration Information" and "Declared registrant
   of the namespace" fields in the registration, specified in RFC 5328,
   Section 2.  The new information for those fields is as follows:

   Registration Information:

      Version: 2
      Date: 2014-05-19 [[RFC Editor: Please use the date of publication here.]]

   Declared registrant of the namespace:

         Name:         Peter Siebert
         Title:        Executive Director, DVB Project Office
         Affiliation:  DVB Digital Video Broadcasting
         Address:      Ancienne Route 17a
                       CH-1218 Geneva
                       SWITZERLAND
         Phone:        +41 22 717 2717
         Email:        dvb@dvb.org

   All other fields in the registration information are unchanged, and
   remain as specified in RFC 5328

3.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations for this registration update.

Internet-Draft          DVB URN Registrant Update              June 2014


4.  IANA Considerations

   In the Formal URN Namespaces registry
   (http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces) IANA is asked to
   change the reference field for the "dvb" namespace to include this
   RFC in addition to RFC 5328.  The reference field will now contain
   two RFC numbers.

              Namespace for the Digital Video Broadcasting Project
              (DVB)", RFC 5328, September 2008.
