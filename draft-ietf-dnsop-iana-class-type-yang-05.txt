1.  Introduction

   YANG [RFC7950] has become a de facto standard as a language for
   modeling configuration and state data, as well as specifying
   management operations and asynchronous notifications.  It is
   reasonable to expect that the approach based on utilizing such data
   models along with standard management protocols such as
   NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040] can be effectively used in
   DNS operations, too.  In fact, several efforts are currently underway
   that attempt to use NETCONF or RESTCONF for configuring and managing

   *  authoritative servers

   *  resolvers

   *  zone data.

   While it is possible to use the management protocols mentioned above
   with ad hoc or proprietary data models, their real potential can be
   realized only if there is a (completely or partly) unified data model
   supported by multiple DNS software implementations.  Operators can
   then, for instance, run several DNS server implementations in
   parallel, and use a common configuration and management interface and
   data for all of them.  Also, it becomes considerably easier to
   migrate to another implementation.

   Based on the previous experience from the IETF Routing Area, it is to
   be expected that the development of unified data models for DNS will
   be a lengthy and complicated process that will require active
   cooperation and compromises from the vendors and developers of major
   DNS server platforms.  Nevertheless, it is likely that any DNS-
   related data modeling effort will need to use various DNS parameters
   and enumerations that are specified in several IANA registries.  For
   use with YANG, these parameters and enumerations have to be

   translated into corresponding YANG types or other structures.  Such
   translations should be straightforward and relatively
   uncontroversial.

   This document provides a translation of two fundamental DNS-related
   IANA registries to YANG.  It contains the initial revision of the
   YANG module "iana-dns-class-rr-type" that defines derived types for
   the common parameters of DNS resource records (RR): class and type.
   These YANG types, "dns-class" and "rr-type", reflect the IANA
   registries "DNS CLASSes" and "Resource Record (RR) TYPEs"
   [IANA-DNS-PARAMETERS].

   Appendix A contains an XSLT 1.0 stylesheet that is intended to be
   used by IANA for generating the initial revision of the "iana-dns-
   class-rr-type" YANG module.  Subsequently, whenever a new class or RR
   type is added to the above registries, IANA will also update the
   "iana-dns-class-rr-type" YANG module, following the instructions in
   Section 4 below.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The terminology for describing YANG data models can be found in
   [RFC7950].  DNS terminology used in this document can be found in
   [RFC1035] and [RFC8499].

3.  YANG Design Considerations

   At the time of writing, the IANA document "Domain Name System (DNS)
   Parameters" [IANA-DNS-PARAMETERS] contains altogether thirteen
   registries.  The YANG module "iana-dns-class-rr-type" defines derived
   types corresponding to only two of the registries that are essential
   for data models involving zone data, namely "DNS CLASSes" and
   "Resource Record (RR) TYPEs".  It is expected that the remaining
   registries in [IANA-DNS-PARAMETERS], as well as other DNS-related
   IANA registries, will be analogously reflected in future YANG modules
   as necessary.  This way, an appropriate combination of YANG modules
   can be chosen depending on which YANG types are needed for a given
   data modeling purpose.

   The registries "DNS CLASSes" and "Resource Record (RR) TYPEs" are
   transformed into YANG enumeration types "dns-class-name" and "rr-
   type-name", respectively.  This is the initial fragment of the
   former:

     typedef dns-class-name {
       type enumeration {
         enum IN {
           value 1;
           description
             "Internet (IN)";
           reference
             "RFC 1035";
         }
         ...
       }
       ...
     }

   The other derived type, "rr-type-name", is defined similarly.

   [RFC3597] introduced the option of specifying a class or RR type via
   its assigned decimal number, as an alternative to the mnemonic name.
   For example, the "IN" class can be equivalently written as "CLASS1",
   and "AAAA" type can be written as "TYPE28".

   Accordingly, the derived types "dns-class" and "rr-type" are defined
   in the YANG module as a union of two member types:

   *  16-bit decimal integer ("uint16")

   *  mnemonic name belonging to the enumerations "dns-class-name" and
      "rr-type-name", respectively.

   For instance, the "rr-type" type is defined as follows:

     typedef rr-type {
       type union {
         type uint16;
         type rr-type-name;
       }
       description
         "This type allows for referring to a DNS resource record type
          using either the assigned mnemonic name or numeric value.";
     }

Internet-Draft         iana-dns-class-rr-type-yang             June 2021


   As unassigned and reserved class and RR type values are not included
   in the mnemonic name enumerations, they can only be specified using
   their decimal values.

4.  IANA Considerations

   RFC Editor: In this section, replace all occurrences of "XXXX" with
   the actual RFC number (and remove this note).

   This section deals with actions and processes necessary for IANA to
   undertake to maintain the "iana-dns-class-rr-type" YANG module.  This
   YANG module is intended to reflect the "DNS CLASSes" and "Resource
   Record (RR) TYPEs" registries in [IANA-DNS-PARAMETERS].  The most
   recent revision of the YANG module is available from the "YANG
   Parameters" registry [IANA-YANG-PARAMETERS].

   Upon publication of this document, the initial revision of the "iana-
   dns-class-rr-type" YANG module SHALL be created by applying the XSLT
   stylesheet from Appendix A to the XML version of
   [IANA-DNS-PARAMETERS].

   IANA SHALL add this note to the "iana-dns-class-rr-type" item of the
   "YANG Module Names" registry [IANA-YANG-PARAMETERS]:

   |  Classes and types of DNS resource records must not be directly
   |  added to the "iana-dns-class-rr-type" YANG module.  They must
   |  instead be added to the "DNS CLASSes" and "Resource Record (RR)
   |  TYPEs" registries, respectively.

   When a new DNS class or RR type is added to the "DNS CLASSes" or
   "Resource Record (RR) TYPEs" registry, a new "enum" statement SHALL
   be added to the "dns-class-name" or "rr-type-name" type,
   respectively.  The assigned name defined by the "enum" statement
   SHALL be the same as the mnemonic name of the new class or type.  The
   following substatements to the "enum" statement SHALL be defined:

   "value":  Use the decimal value from the registry.

   "status":  Include only if a class or type registration has been
      deprecated or obsoleted.  IANA "deprecated" maps to YANG status
      "deprecated", and IANA "obsolete" maps to YANG status "obsolete".

   "description":  Replicate the corresponding information from the
      registry, namely the full name of the new DNS class, or the
      meaning of the new RR type, if any.

   "reference":  Replicate the reference(s) from the registry.

   Unassigned or reserved values SHALL NOT be included in the "dns-
   class-name" and "rr-type-name" enumeration types.

   Each time the "iana-dns-class-rr-type" YANG module is updated, a new
   "revision" statement SHALL be added before the existing "revision"
   statements.

   IANA SHALL add this new note to the "DNS CLASSes" and "Resource
   Record (RR) TYPEs" registries:

   |  When this registry is modified, the YANG module "iana-dns-class-
   |  rr-type" must be updated as defined in RFC XXXX.

   The "Reference" text in the "DNS CLASSes" registry SHALL be updated
   as follows:

   |     OLD:
   |       [RFC6895]
   |  
   |     NEW:
   |       [RFC6895][RFCXXXX]

   The "Reference" text in the "Resource Record (RR) TYPEs" registry
   SHALL be updated as follows:

   |     OLD:
   |       [RFC6895][RFC1035]
   |  
   |     NEW:
   |       [RFC6895][RFC1035][RFCXXXX]

5.  Security Considerations

   This document translates two IANA registries into YANG data types and
   otherwise introduces no technology or protocol.  The definitions
   themselves have no security impact on the Internet, but their use in
   concrete YANG modules might have.  The security considerations
   spelled out in the YANG specification [RFC7950] apply for this
   document as well.

Appendix A.  XSLT Stylesheet

   RFC Editor: In this section, replace all occurrences of "XXXX" with
   the actual RFC number (and remove this note).

   This appendix contains an XSLT 1.0 stylesheet [W3C.REC-xslt-19991116]
   that is intended to be used for generating the initial revision of
   the "iana-dns-class-rr-type" YANG module.  This is achieved by
   applying the stylesheet to the XML version of the IANA registry
   "Domain Name System (DNS) Parameters" [IANA-DNS-PARAMETERS] that was
   current at the time when this document was published.

   Using the ubiquitous xsltproc tool, the YANG module text can be
   generated with this command:

       $ xsltproc iana-dns-class-rr-type.xsl dns-parameters.xml
