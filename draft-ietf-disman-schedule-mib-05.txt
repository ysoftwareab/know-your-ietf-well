Internet-Draft                Schedule MIB                   August 1998


1.  Abstract

   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
   the Internet community. In particular, it describes a set of managed
   objects that are used to schedule management operations periodically
   or at specified dates and times.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

   This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet community.


2.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [1].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        RFC 1155 [2], RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The second version,
        called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [5], RFC 1903 [6] and RFC
        1904 [7].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message
        protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is
        called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
        The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and
        described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2272 [11] and RFC 2274 [12].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol operations
        and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [14] and
        the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2275
        [15].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed

   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.


3.  Overview

   The MIB defined in this memo provides scheduling of actions
   periodically or at specified dates and times. The actions can be used
   to realize on-duty / off-duty schedules or to trigger management
   functions in a distributed management application.

   Schedules can be enabled or disabled by modifying a control object.
   This allows pre-configured schedules which are activated or de-
   activated by some other management functions.

   The term `scheduler' is used throughout this memo to refer to the
   entity which implements the scheduling MIB and which invokes the
   actions at the specified points in time.


3.1.  Periodic Schedules


   Periodic schedules are based on fixed time periods between the
   initiation of scheduled actions. Periodic schedules are defined by
   specifying the number of seconds between two initiations. The time
   needed to complete the action is usually not known by the scheduler
   and does therefore not influence the next scheduling point.

   Implementations must guarantee that action invocations will not occur
   before their next scheduled time.  However, implementations may be
   forced to delay invocations in the face of local constraints (e.g., a
   heavy load on higher-priority tasks).  An accumulation of such delays
   would result in a drift of the scheduling interval with respect to
   time, and should be avoided.

   Scheduled actions collecting statistical data should retrieve time

   stamps from the data source and not rely on the accuracy of the
   periodic scheduler in order to obtain accurate statistics.


3.2.  Calendar Schedules

   Calendar schedules trigger scheduled actions at specified days of the
   week and days of the month. Calendar schedules are therefore aware of
   the notion of months, days, weekdays, hours and minutes.

   It is possible to specify multiple values for each calendar item.
   This provides a mechanism for defining complex schedules.  For
   example, a schedule could be defined which triggers an action every
   15 minutes on a given weekday.

   Months, days and weekdays are specified using the objects schedMonth,
   schedDay and schedWeekDay of type BITS. Setting multiple bits to one
   in these objects causes an OR operation. For example, setting the
   bits monday(1) and friday(5) in schedWeekDay restricts the schedule
   to Mondays and Fridays.

   The bit fields for schedMonth, schedDay and schedWeekDay are combined
   using an AND operation. For example, setting the bits june(5) and
   july(6) in schedMonth and combining it with the bits monday(1) and
   friday(5) set in schedWeekDay will result in a schedule which is
   restricted to every Monday and Friday in the months June and July.
   Wildcarding of calendar items is achieved by setting all bits to one.

   It is possible to define calendar schedules that will never trigger
   an action. For example, one can define a calendar schedule which
   should trigger an action on February 31st. Schedules like this will
   simply be ignored by the scheduler.

   Finally, calendar schedules are always expressed in local time. A
   scalar, schedLocalTime is provided so that a manager can retrieve the
   notion of local time and the offset to GMT time.


3.3.  One-shot Schedules

   One-shot Schedules are similar to calendar schedules. The difference
   between a calendar schedule and a one-shot schedule is that a one-
   shot schedule will automatically disable itself once an action has
   been invoked.

3.4.  Time Transitions

   When a system's notion of time is changed for some reason,
   implementations of the Schedule MIB must schedule actions
   differently.  One example of a change to a system's notion of time is
   when a daylight savings time transition occurs.

   There are two possible situations when a time transition occurs.
   First, time may be set backwards, in which case particular times will
   appear to occur twice within the same day.  These are called
   'ambiguous times'.  Second, time may be set forwards, in which case
   particular times will appear to not occur within a day.  This are
   called 'nonexistent times'.

   When an action is configured in the Schedule MIB to occur at an
   ambiguous time during a time transition, the action should only be
   invoked at the first occurence of the ambiguous time.  For example,
   if an action is scheduled to occur at 2:00 am, and a time transition
   occurs at 3:00 am which sets the clock back to 2:00 am, the action
   should only be invoked at the first occurence of 2:00 am.

   When an action is configured in the Schedule MIB to occur at a
   nonexistent time, the action should be invoked immediately upon a
   time transition. If multiple actions are invoked in this way, they
   should be invoked in the order in which they normally would be
   invoked had the time transition not occured. For example, if an
   action (a) is scheduled at 2:05 am and another action (b) at 2:10 am,
   then both actions should be invoked at 3:00 am in the order (a),(b)
   if the time jumps forward from 2:00 am to 3:00 am.


3.5.  Actions

   Scheduled actions are modeled by SNMP set operations on local MIB
   variables. Scheduled actions described in this MIB are further
   restricted to objects of type INTEGER. This restriction does not
   limit the usefulness of the MIB.  Simple schedules such as on-duty /
   off-duty schedules for resources that have a status MIB object (e.g.
   ifAdminStatus) are possible.

   More complex actions can be realized by triggering a management
   script which is responsible for performing complex state transitions.
   A management script can also be used to perform SNMP set operations
   on remote SNMP engines.

5.  Usage Examples

   This section presents some examples how the scheduling MIB can be
   used to schedule scripts with the Script MIB [17] or to realize on-
   duty/off-duty schedules by modifying status objects of other MIB
   modules.


5.1.  Starting a script to ping devices every 20 minutes

   It is assumed that the schedule entry is owned by schedOwner = "joe"
   and its name is schedName = "ping". The instance identifier for the
   scheduling entry is therefore 3.106.111.101.4.112.105.110.103.

   It is further assumed that the smLaunchTable entry is owned by
   smLaunchOwner = "joe" and its name is smLaunchName = "ping-devs". The
   complete object identifier for the smLaunchStart object is therefore
   smLaunchStart.3.106.111.101.9.112.105.110.103.45.100.101.118.115. The
   script lives in the context identified by the string "engine1".

   The configuration of the scheduler entry which presses the launch

5.2.  Starting a script at the next Friday the 13th

   It is assumed that the schedule entry is owned by schedOwner = "joe"
   and its name is schedName = "13th". The instance identifier for the
   scheduling entry is therefore 3.106.111.101.4.49.51.116.104.

   smLaunchOwner = "joe" and its name is smLaunchName = "ghost". The

   complete object identifier for the smLaunchStart object is therefore
   smLaunchStart.3.106.111.101.5.103.104.111.115.116. The script lives
   in the context identified by the string "engine1".

   The configuration of the scheduler entry which presses the launch
   button on every Friday 13th at midnight would look as follows:

5.3.  Turning an interface off during weekends

   This example assumes that a network interface should be taken down
   during weekends. The interface table (ifTable) of the IF-MIB [18] is
   assumed to exist in the context identified by an empty string and the
   index of the interface is ifIndex = 6.

   The scheduling entry which brings the interface down on every Friday
   evening at 20:30 (8:30 pm) is owned by schedOwner = "bob" and its
   name is schedName = "if-off". The instance identifier for the
   scheduling entry is therefore 3.98.111.98.6.105.102.45.111.102.102.

     schedWeekDay.3.98.111.98.6.105.102.45.111.102.102 = { friday }

   A similar configuration could be used to control other schedules. For
   example, one could change the "if-on" and "if-off" schedules to
   enable and disable the periodic scheduler defined in the first
   example.


6.  Security Considerations

   Scheduled SNMP set operations must use the security credentials that
   were present when the corresponding row in the scheduling entry was
   created.  An implementation must therefore record and maintain the
   credentials for every scheduling entry.

   An implementation must ensure that access control rules are applied
   when doing the set operation. This is accomplished by calling the
   isAccessAllowed abstract service interface defined in RFC 2271 [1]:

      statusInformation =          -- success or errorIndication
        isAccessAllowed(
        IN   securityModel         -- Security Model in use
        IN   securityName          -- principal who wants to access
        IN   securityLevel         -- Level of Security
        IN   viewType              -- read, write, or notify view
        IN   contextName           -- context containing variableName
        IN   variableName          -- OID for the managed object
             )

   The securityModel, securityName and securityLevel parameters are set
   to the values that were recorded when the scheduling entry was
   created. The viewType parameter must select the write view and the
   contextName and variableName parameters are taken from the
   schedContextName and schedVariableName values of the scheduling
   entry.

   This MIB limits scheduled actions to objects in the local MIB. This
   avoids security problems with the delegation of access rights.
   However, it might be possible for a user of this MIB to own some
   schedules that might trigger far in the future. This can cause
   security risks if the security administrator did not properly update
   the access control lists when a user is withdrawn from an SNMP
   engine. Therefore, entries in the schedTable SHOULD be cleaned up
   whenever a user is removed from an SNMP engine.

   To facilitate the provisioning of access control by a security
   administrator using the View-Based Access Control Model (VACM)

   defined in RFC 2275 [15] for tables in which multiple users may need
   to independently create or modify entries, the initial index is used
   as an "owner index". Such an initial index has a syntax of
   SnmpAdminString, and can thus be trivially mapped to a securityName
   or groupName as defined in VACM, in accordance with a security
   policy.

   All entries in related tables belonging to a particular user will
   have the same value for this initial index.  For a given user's
   entries in a particular table, the object identifiers for the
   information in these entries will have the same subidentifiers
   (except for the "column" subidentifier) up to the end of the encoded
   owner index. To configure VACM to permit access to this portion of
   the table, one would create vacmViewTreeFamilyTable entries with the
   value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree including the owner index portion,
   and vacmViewTreeFamilyMask "wildcarding" the column subidentifier.
   More elaborate configurations are possible.

        added references to SNMPv3.

   o    Replaced Utf8String with SnmpAdminString.

   o    Added Intellectual Property section.

   o    Changed some wordings to make the text more readable.


12.3.  Changes from <draft-ietf-disman-schedule-mib-02>


   o    Fixes some typos.

   o    Changed the semantics of "no bits set" and added DEFVALs which
        default to nothing scheduled.

   o    Added reference to BCP-11.

   o    Added the schedContextName object to indicate the context of the
        variable being set by the scheduler.

   o    Added three examples to demonstrate the usage of the scheduling
        MIB.

   o    Created a new TC SnmpPduErrorStatus which contains SNMP PDU
        error status codes plus `noResponse'.

   o    Added the new boilerplate and the references that go along with
        it.

   o    Removed the transitional states `enabling' and `disabling' from
        the schedOperStatus object.

   o    Defined the set of objects that must be writable if the storage
        type of a row is permanent.

   o    List the objects that have to get values assigned during row
        creation in order to set a row to `active'.

   o    Added text which describes how the isAccessAllowed abstract
        service interface is called for access control.

   o    Added Randy's text which explains the indexing structure without
        refering to a DISMAN framework.

   o    Replaced schedIndex with schedName. This allows semantic
        meaningful references to scheduling entries.


12.4.  Changes from <draft-ietf-disman-schedule-mib-03>


   o    Changed the MIB module name to DISMAN-SCHEDULE-MIB.

   o    Fixed the example to make the indexing consistent with the new
        version of the Script MIB.

   o    Removed the IMPLIED keyword and updated the examples.

   o    Moved the change logs to the end of the document.

Internet-Draft                Schedule MIB                   August 1998


12.5.  Changes from <draft-ietf-disman-schedule-mib-04>


   o    Added the key words boilerplate from RFC 2119.

   o    Replaced "DISMAN application" with distributed management
        application.

   o    Replaced schedMIBTraps with schedTraps.

   o    Reworded the last sentence in the second paragraph of the
        security considerations to use SHOULD as defined in RFC 2119.

   o    Exchanged monday and friday in the example.

   o    Added a new section about time transitions.

   o    Added the schedLocalTime object which provides access to the
        local time and the local timezone (offset from GMT). Add text to
        define that calendar schedules are always in local time.

   o    Added the DEFVAL { 0 } to schedInterval and added text which
        describes that periodic schedules with a schedInterval of 0
        seconds must be ignored.

   o    Added schedLastFailed to the schedActionFailure notification.

   o    Replaced the phrase "launch button" with more precise
        terminology.

   o    Changed schedAdminStatus and schedOperStatus to have only the
        states enabled/disabled. Added a new schedType object which
        defines whether we have a periodic, calendar or one-shot
        schedule. Added a new schedOperStatus state finished which is
        used when a one-shot schedule ends. Changed the first example to
        schedule an event on the next friday 13th using a one-shot
        schedule and updated all examples.

   o    Defined the term scheduler in the overview section.

   o    Added text to the section describing calendar schedules in order
        to better describe how it works.

   o    Added bits to schedDay which allow to specify days relative to
        the end of the month.
