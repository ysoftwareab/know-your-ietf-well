                      Strict Bundling Registration
               draft-yao-regext-bundling-registration-06

Abstract

   This document describes an extension of Extensible Provisioning
   Protocol (EPP) domain name mapping for the provisioning and
   management of strict bundling registration of domain names.
   Specified in XML, this mapping extends the EPP domain name mapping to
   provide additional features required for the provisioning of bundled
   domain names.  This is a non-standard proprietary extension.

Internet-Draft          EPP bundled names Mapping              June 2021


1.  Introduction

   In RFC4290 [RFC4290], the "variant(s)" are character(s) and/or
   string(s) that are treated as equivalent to the base character.  In
   this document, variants are those strings that are treated to be
   equivalent to each other according to the domain name registration
   policy.  Bundled domain names are those which share the same Top
   Level Domain (TLD) but whose second level labels are variants, or
   those which have identical second level labels for which certain
   parameters are shared in different TLDs.  For example, Public
   Interest Registry has requested to implement bundling of second level
   domains for .NGO and .ONG.  So we have two kinds of bundled domain
   names.  The first one is in the form of "V-label.TLD" in which the
   second level label (V-label) is a variant sharing the same TLD; The
   second one is in the form of "LABEL.V-tld" in which the second level
   label (LABEL) remains the same but ending with a different TLD
   (V-tld), and these different V-tlds are managed by the same entity.

   Bundled domain names normally share some attributes.  Policy-wise
   bundling can be implemented in three ways.  The first one is strict
   bundling, which requires all bundled names to share many of the same
   attributes.  When creating, updating, or transferring any of the
   bundled domain names, all bundled domain names will be created,
   updated or transferred atomically.  The second one is partial
   bundling, which requires the bundled domain names to be registered by
   the same registrant.  The third one is relaxed bundling, which has no
   specific requirements on the domain registration.  This document
   mainly addresses the strict bundling name registration.

   For the name variants, different registries have different policies.
   Some registries adopt the policy that variant Internationalized
   Domain Name (IDNs) should be blocked.  But some registries adopt the
   policy that variant IDNs which are identified as equivalent are
   allocated or delegated to the same registrant.  For example, most
   registries offering Chinese Domain Name (CDN) adopt a registration
   policy whereby a registrant can apply for an original CDN in any
   forms: Simplified Chinese (SC) form, Traditional Chinese (TC) form,
   or other variant forms, then the corresponding variant CDN in SC form
   and that in TC form will also be delegated to the same registrant.
   All variant names in the same TLD share a common set of attributes.
   This document mainly discuss the situation that variant IDNs which
   are identified as equivalent are allocated or delegated to the same
   registrant.

   The basic Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) domain name mapping
   [RFC5731] provides the facility for single domain name registration.
   It does not specify how to register the strict bundled names which
   share many of the attributes.

Internet-Draft          EPP bundled names Mapping              June 2021


   In order to meet the above requirements of strict bundled name
   registration, this document describes an extension of the EPP domain
   name mapping [RFC5731] for the provisioning and management of bundled
   names.  This document describes a non-standard proprietary extension.
   This extension is especially useful for registries of practicing
   Chinese domain name registration.  This method is also useful for
   other language domain names that have similar issues with Chinese
   domain names.  This document is specified using Extensible Markup
   Language (XML) 1.0 as described in [W3C.REC-xml-20040204] and XML
   Schema notation as described in [W3C.REC-xmlschema-1-20041028] and
   [W3C.REC-xmlschema-2-20041028].

   The EPP core protocol specification [RFC5730] provides a complete
   description of EPP command and response structures.  A thorough
   understanding of the base protocol specification is necessary to
   understand the extension mapping described in this document.

   This document uses many IDN concepts, so a thorough understanding of
   the IDNs for Application (IDNA, described in [RFC5890], [RFC5891],
   and [RFC5892]) and the variant approach discussed in [RFC4290] is
   assumed.

2.  Terminology

   Variants in this document are those strings that are treated to be
   equivalent to each other according to the domain name registration
   policy for certain TLDs.

   Bundled domain names are bundled together according to the domain
   name registration policy.  For example, many Chinese domain name
   registries follow the principle described in RFC3743[RFC3743].
   Bundled domain names should belong to the same owner.  If bundled
   domain names are under different TLDs, those TLDs should be managed
   by the same entity.

   The terms Registered Domain Name(RDN) and Bundled Domain Name(BDN)
   are used in this document.  RDN represents the valid domain name that
   registrants submitted for the initial registration.  BDN represents
   the bundled domain name produced according to the bundled domain name
   registration policy.  In current practice, the number of BDNs is
   usually be kept to one according to the registration policy set by
   the registry.  Both RDN and BDN specified in this document will be
   registered via EPP.  All other domain names related to the RDN will
   be blocked.

   uLabel in this document is used to express the U-label of an
   internationalized domain name as a series of characters where non-
   ASCII characters will be represented in the format of "&#xXXXX;"

Internet-Draft          EPP bundled names Mapping              June 2021


   where XXXX is a UNICODE point by using the XML escaping mechanism.
   U-Label is defined in [RFC5890].  This document chooses this format
   of literal HTML ampersand codes, not the expected UNICODE native
   characters, is because of that the UNICODE native characters may not
   be displayed correctly in some text file readers while literal HTML
   ampersand codes are easy for HTML processors.  The implementation
   following this document should use UNICODE native characters
   directly.

   This document uses the prefix "b-dn" for the namespace
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp:b-dn" throughout.  Implementations cannot
   assume that any particular prefix is used, and must employ a
   namespace-aware XML parser and serializer to interpret and output the
   XML documents.

   In examples, "C:" represents lines sent by a protocol client and "S:"
   represents lines returned by a protocol server.  Indentation and
   white space in examples are provided only to illustrate element
   relationships and are not a required feature of this specification.

   XML is case sensitive.  Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications
   and examples provided in this document must be interpreted in the
   character case presented to develop a conforming implementation.

3.  Overview

   Domain registries have traditionally adopted a registration model
   whereby metadata relating to a domain name, such as its expiration
   date and sponsoring registrar, are stored as properties of the domain
   object.  The domain object is then considered an atomic unit of
   registration, on which operations such as update, renewal and
   deletion may be performed.

   Bundled names brought about the need for multiple domain names to be
   registered and managed as a single package.  In this model, the
   registry typically accepts a domain registration request (i.e.  EPP
   domain <create> command) containing the domain name to be registered.
   This domain name is referred to as the RDN in this document.  As part
   of the processing of the registration request, the registry generates
   a set of bundled names that are related to the RDN, either
   programmatically or with the guidance of registration policies, and
   places them in the registration package together with the RDN.

   The bundled names share many properties, such as expiration date and
   sponsoring registrar, by sharing the same domain object.  So when
   registrants update any property of a domain object within a bundle
   package, that property will be updated at the same time for all other
   domain objects in the bundle package.

4.  Requirement for Bundling Registration of Names

   The bundled names whether they are in the form of "V-label.TLD" or in
   the form of "LABEL.V-tld" should share some parameters or attributes
   associated with domain names.  Typically, bundled names will share
   the following parameters or attributes:

   o  Registrar Ownership

   o  Registration and Expiry Dates

   o  Registrant, Admin, Billing, and Technical Contacts

   o  Name Server Association

   o  Domain Status

   o  Applicable grace periods (Add Grace Period, Renewal Grace Period,
      Auto-Renewal Grace Period, Transfer Grace Period, and Redemption
      Grace Period)

   Because the domain names are bundled and share the same parameters or
   attributes, the EPP command should do some processing for these
   requirements:

   o  When performing a Domain Check, either BDN or RDN can be queried
      for the EPP command, and will return the same response.

   o  When performing a Domain Info, either BDN or RDN can be queried,
      the same response will include both BDN and RDN information with
      the same attributes.

   o  When performing a Domain Create, if the domain name is available,
      both BDN and RDN will be registered.

   o  When performing a Domain Delete, either BDN or RDN will be
      accepted.  If the domain name is registered, both BDN and RDN will
      be deleted.

   o  When performing a Domain Renew, either BDN or RDN will be
      accepted.  Upon a successful domain renewal, both BDN and RDN will
      have their expiry date extended by the requested term.  Upon a
      successful domain renewal, both BDN and RDN will conform to the
      same renew grace period.

   o  When performing a Domain Transfer, either BDN or RDN will be
      accepted.  Upon successful completion of a domain transfer
      request, both BDN and RDN will enter a pendingTransfer status.

Internet-Draft          EPP bundled names Mapping              June 2021


      Upon approval of the transfer request, both BDN and RDN will be
      owned and managed by the same new registrant.

   o  When performing a Domain Update, either BDN or RDN will be
      accepted.  Any modifications to contact associations, name server
      associations, domain status values and authorization information
      will be applied to both BDN and RDN.

5.  Object Attributes

   This extension defines following additional elements to the EPP
   domain name mapping [RFC5731].  All of these additional elements are
   returned from <domain:info> command.

5.1.  RDN

   The RDN is an ASCII name or an IDN with the A-label [RFC5890] form.
   In this document, its corresponding element is <b-dn:rdn>.  An
   optional attribute "uLabel" associated with <b-dn:rdn> is used to
   represent the U-label [RFC5890] form.

   For example: <b-dn:rdn uLabel="&#x5B9E;&#x4F8B;.example"> xn--
   fsq270a.example</b-dn:rdn>

5.2.  BDN

   The BDN is an ASCII name or an IDN with the A-label [RFC5890] form
   which is converted from the corresponding BDN.  In this document, its
   corresponding element is <b-dn:bdn>.  An optional attribute "uLabel"
   associated with <b-dn:bdn> is used to represent the U-label [RFC5890]
   form.

   For example: <b-dn:bdn uLabel="&#x5BE6;&#x4F8B;.example"> xn--
   fsqz41a.example</b-dn:bdn>

6.  EPP Command Mapping

   A detailed description of the EPP syntax and semantics can be found
   in the EPP core protocol specification [RFC5730].  The command
   mappings described here are specifically for use in provisioning and
   managing bundled names via EPP.

6.1.  EPP Query Commands

   EPP provides three commands to retrieve domain information: <check>
   to determine if a domain object can be provisioned within a
   repository, <info> to retrieve detailed information associated with a

Internet-Draft          EPP bundled names Mapping              June 2021


   domain object, and <transfer> to retrieve domain-object transfer
   status information.

6.1.1.  EPP <check> Command

   This extension does not add any element to the EPP <check> command or
   <check> response described in the EPP domain name mapping [RFC5731].
   However, when either RDN or BDN is sent for check, response should
   contain both RDN and BDN information, which may also give some
   explanation in the reason field to tell the registrant that the
   associated domain name is a produced name according to some bundle
   domain name policy.


   Example <check> response:
   S:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
   S:<epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
   S:  <response>
   S:    <result code="1000">
   S:      <msg>Command completed successfully</msg>
   S:    </result>
   S:    <resData>
   S:      <domain:chkData
   S:        xmlns:domain="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:domain-1.0">
   S:          <domain:cd>
   S:           <domain:name avail="1">
   S:            xn--fsq270a.example</domain:name>
   S:          </domain:cd>
   S:          <domain:cd>
   S:            <domain:name avail="1">
   S:              xn--fsqz41a.example
   S:            </domain:name>
   S:            <domain:reason>This associated domain name is
   S:              a produced name based on bundle name policy.
   S:            </domain:reason>
   S:          </domain:cd>
   S:      </domain:chkData>
   S:    </resData>
   S:    <trID>
   S:      <clTRID>ABC-12345</clTRID>
   S:      <svTRID>54322-XYZ</svTRID>
   S:    </trID>
   S:  </response>
   S:</epp>

Internet-Draft          EPP bundled names Mapping              June 2021


6.1.2.  EPP <info> Command

   This extension does not add any element to the EPP <info> command
   described in the EPP domain mapping [RFC5731].  However, additional
   elements are defined for the <info> response.

   When an <info> command has been processed successfully, the EPP
   <resData> element must contain child elements as described in the EPP
   domain mapping [RFC5731].  In addition, unless some registration
   policy has some special processing, the EPP <extension> element
   should contain a child <b-dn:infData> element that identifies the
   extension namespace if the domain object has data associated with
   this extension and based on its registration policy.  The
   <b-dn:infData> element contains the <b-dn:bundle> which has the
   following child elements:

   o  An <b-dn:rdn> element that contains the RDN, along with the
      attribute described below.

   o  An optional <b-dn:bdn> element that contains the BDN, along with
      the attribute described below.

   The above elements contain the following attribute:

   o  An optional "uLabel" attribute represents the U-label of the
      element.

   Example <info> response for an authorized client:

   S:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
   S:<epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
   S:  <response>
   S:    <result code="1000">
   S:      <msg>Command completed successfully</msg>
   S:    </result>
   S:    <resData>
   S:      <domain:infData
   S:        xmlns:domain="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:domain-1.0">
   S:        <domain:name>xn--fsq270a.example</domain:name>
   S:        <domain:roid>58812678-domain</domain:roid>
   S:        <domain:status s="ok"/>
   S:        <domain:registrant>123</domain:registrant>
   S:        <domain:contact type="admin">123</domain:contact>
   S:        <domain:contact type="tech">123</domain:contact>
   S:        <domain:ns>

   <info> Response for the unauthorized client has not been changed, see
   [RFC5731] for detail.

   An EPP error response must be returned if an <info> command cannot be
   processed for any reason.

6.1.3.  EPP <transfer> Query Command

   This extension does not add any element to the EPP <transfer> command
   or <transfer> response described in the EPP domain mapping [RFC5731].

6.2.  EPP Transform Commands

   EPP provides five commands to transform domain objects: <create> to
   create an instance of a domain object, <delete> to delete an instance
   of a domain object, <renew> to extend the validity period of a domain

   object, <transfer> to manage domain object sponsorship changes, and
   <update> to change information associated with a domain object.

   When theses commands have been processed successfully, the EPP
   <resData> element must contain child elements as described in the EPP
   domain mapping [RFC5731].  Unless some registration policy has some
   special processing, this EPP <extension> element should contain the
   <b-dn:bundle> which has the following child elements:

   o  An <b-dn:rdn> element that contains the RDN, along with the
      attribute described below.

   o  An optional <b-dn:bdn> element that contains the BDN, along with
      the attribute described below.

   The above elements contain the following attribute:

   o  An optional "uLabel" attribute represents the U-label of the
      element.

6.2.1.  EPP <create> Command

   This extension defines additional elements to extend the EPP <create>
   command described in the EPP domain name mapping [RFC5731] for
   bundled names registration.

   In addition to the EPP command elements described in the EPP domain
   mapping [RFC5731], the <create> command shall contain an <extension>
   element.  Unless some registration policy has some special
   processing, the <extension> element should contain a child
   <b-dn:create> element that identifies the bundle namespace, and a
   child <b-dn:rdn> element that identifies the U-Label form of the
   registered domain name with the uLabel attribute.  U-Label is used
   for easy reading by the registrants and easy debugging by the
   registrars and the registries.

   When a <create> command has been processed successfully, the EPP
   <creData> element must contain child elements as described in the EPP
   domain mapping [RFC5731].  In addition, unless some registration

8.  Internationalization Considerations

   EPP is represented in XML, which provides native support for encoding
   information using the Unicode character set and its more compact
   representations including UTF-8.  Conformant XML processors recognize
   both UTF-8 and UTF-16.  Though XML includes provisions to identify
   and use other character encodings through use of an "encoding"
   attribute in an <?xml?> declaration, use of UTF-8 is recommended.

   As an extension of the EPP domain name mapping, the elements, and
   element content described in this document must inherit the
   internationalization conventions used to represent higher-layer
   domain and core protocol structures present in an XML instance that
   includes this extension.

9.  IANA Considerations

9.1.  XML Namespace and XML Schema

   This document uses URNs to describe XML namespaces and XML schemas
   conforming to a registry mechanism described in [RFC3688].

Internet-Draft          EPP bundled names Mapping              June 2021


9.1.1.  BDN Namespace

   IANA is requested to make an assignment from the IETF XML Registry
   "ns" registry as follows for the BDN namespace with this document as
   the reference:

   o  URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp:b-dn

   o  Registrant Contact: See the "Author's Address" section of this
      document.

   o  XML: None.  Namespace URI does not represent an XML specification.

9.1.2.  BDN XML Schema

   IANA is requested to make an assignment from the IETF XML Registry
   "schema" registry as follows for the BDN XML schema with this
   document as the reference:

   o  URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:epp:b-dn

   o  Registrant Contact: See the "Author's Address" section of this
      document.

   o  XML: See the "Formal Syntax" section of this document.

9.2.  EPP Extension

   The EPP extension described in this document should be registered by
   IANA in the "Extensions for the Extensible Provisioning Protocol
   (EPP)" registry described in [RFC7451].  The details of the
   registration are as follows:

   o  Name of Extension: "Domain Name Mapping Extension for Strict
      Bundling Registration"

   o  Document status: Informational

   o  Reference: This document

   o  Registrant Name and Email Address: See the "Author's Address"
      section of this document.

   o  Top-Level Domains (TLDs): Any

   o  IPR Disclosure: https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/2479

   o  Status: Active

10.  Security Considerations

   Normally, the EPP server will only be connected by the authorized EPP
   client which knows whether the EPP server supports the extension
   described in this document via out of band service.  The EPP client
   should avoid to send this extension to the unimplemented EPP server.
   In case that a client that supports this document sends a request to
   a server that does not support this document, the server will return
   the result code 2103 according to the section 3 of RFC5730[RFC5730].
   Section 3 of RFC5730[RFC5730] has the following information for
   result code 2103.


   2103    "Unimplemented extension"

              This response code must be returned when a server receives
              a valid EPP command element that contains a protocol
              command extension that is not implemented by the server.

   Some registries and registrars have more than 15 years experience of
   the bundled registration of domain names (especially Chinese domain
   names).  They have not found any significant security issues.  One
   principle that the registry and registrar should let the registrants
   know is that bundled registered domain names will be created,
   transferred, updated, and deleted together as a group.  The
   registrants for bundled domain names should remember this principle
   when doing some operations to these domain names.  [RFC5730] also
   introduces some security consideration.

   This document does not take a position regarding whether or not the
   bundled domain names share a DS/DNSKEY key.  The DNS administrator
   can choose whether DS/DNSKEY information can be shared or not.  If a
   DS/DNSKEY key is shared, then the bundled domain names share fate if
   there is a key compromise.

11.  Implementation Status and some clarifications

   Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication.

   o  The Chinese Domain Name Consortium(CDNC) including CNNIC, TWNIC,
      HKIRC, MONIC, SGNIC and more have followed the principles defined
      in this document for many years.

   o  CNNIC and TELEINFO have implemented this extension in their EPP
      based Chinese domain name registration system.

   o  Public Interest Registry, has requested to implement technical
      bundling of second level domains for .NGO and .ONG.  This means
      that by registering and purchasing a domain in the .ngo TLD, for
      an example, the NGO registrant is also registering and purchasing
      the corresponding name in the .ong TLD (and vice-versa for
      registrations in .ong).

   o  Patrick Mevzek has released a new version of Net::DRI, an EPP
      client (Perl library, free software) implementing this extension.

   o  The idea and main texts of this document has passed IETF REGEXT WG
      review.
