                       CSS Requirements for RFCs
                          draft-iab-rfc-css-01

Abstract

   The HTML format for RFCs, described in [I-D.iab-html-rfc] assigns
   style guidance to an RFC Editor-defined Cascading Style Sheet (CSS).
   The embedded, default CSS as included by the RFC Editor is expected
   to take into account accessibility needs and be built along a
   responsive design model.  This document describes the requirements
   for the default CSS used by the RFC Editor.  The class names are
   based on the classes defined in draft-iab-html-rfc.

   Discussion of this draft takes place on the rfc-interest mailing list
   (rfc-interest@rfc-editor.org), which has its home page at
   https://www.rfc-editor.org/mailman/listinfo/rfc-interest.

1.  Introduction

   The HTML format for RFCs, described in [I-D.iab-html-rfc] assigns
   style guidance to an RFC Editor-defined Cascading Style Sheet (CSS).
   This CSS will be embedded in the published HTML, and may be
   overridden by a locally defined CSS as desired.  The embedded,
   default CSS as included by the RFC Editor is expected to take into
   account accessibility needs and be built along a responsive design
   model.

   This document describes the requirements for the default CSS used by
   the RFC Editor.  Unless called out otherwise, any styling provided
   for these classes must not alter the natural language content in any
   visible way.  Many of these classes are provided to mark the elements
   semantically: elements using them should simply inherit their
   surrounding styling.  Exceptions are called out below.  A class is
   identified for Internet Drafts, such that certain features found only
   in I-Ds may be made distinct in some fashion within those drafts.
   The requirements will only be applied to HTML documents published by
   the RFC Editor as per [I-D.iab-rfc-framework].

   The details described in this document are expected to change based
   on experience gained in implementing the RFC production center's
   toolset.  Revised documents will be published capturing those changes
   as the toolset is completed.  Other implementers must not expect
   those changes to remain backwards-compatible with the details
   described in this document.

2.  Design Goal

   RFCs must be adaptable to a wide variety of devices and displays,
   accessible to assisted readers, and printable.

Internet-Draft                     I-D                         July 2016


3.  General Requirements

   o  Support the display of the semantic HTML described in
      [I-D.iab-html-rfc].

   o  Follow best practice for accessibility, as defined by the W3C's
      "Best Practices for Authoring HTML" [HTMLBP].

   o  Follow best practice for mobile devices, as defined by the W3C's
      "Best Practices for Authoring HTML."

   o  Allow for a broad range of internationalized scripts.

4.  Page Layout

4.1.  Title Page Header

   The document header must be at the top of the document and include
   all information described in the "Style Guide" and "RFC Streams,
   Headers, and Boilerplates" [RFC7322] [RFC5741]

4.2.  Body

   The body of the document must conform to the following:

   o  Examples and code blocks must be in a fixed-width font

   o  ASCII art must be in a fixed-width font

   o  Reflow the text as the screen gets smaller and limit max width

   o  Block quotes must be indented

   o  Tables must allow for distinct header rows

   o  Paragraphs should include a hover-over paragraph identifier

   All anchor tags and URLs should be clearly distinguished as links,
   for example through the use of color and/or text decoration,
   following appropriate accessibility standards.

4.3.  Font Choices

   o  Default to a sans-serif font family with broad Unicode support for
      web browser viewing.

   o  Default to a serif font family with broad Unicode support for
      printing.

Internet-Draft                     I-D                         July 2016


   o  A fixed-width font must be used for code and artwork-tagged
      sections.

   o  All fonts should be publicly licensed and supported by all major
      web browsers.

5.  Printing

   The CSS must include support for a printer-friendly output.  The
   print rules should be a part of the embedded style sheet; consumers
   of an RFC may develop their own print-specific style sheet as
   desired.

6.  Lists

   Lists should provide ample whitespace between list elements for
   legibility unless a 'compact' class is specified (e.g., .dlCompact,
   .ulCompact, .olCompact).

7.  CSS Classes and Attributes

   This section describes the CSS classes that result in specific
   changes to the natural language content of a document.  A full list
   of available classes, not including basic selectors, are included in
   "Appendix A".

7.1.  .alignCenter

   To be used with '.artwork' to indicate the figure should align in the
   center of the page flow.

7.2.  .alignRight

   To be used with '.artwork' to indicate the figure should align on the
   right of the page flow.

7.3.  .artwork

   These classes will mostly be styled as part of .artwork.  Specific
   classes may include '.art-ascii-art' and '.art-svg'.  Artwork will be
   held in its own block of space, centered in the page flow, and will
   not float.  Images should have a max width of 100% so views will
   scale properly across a variety of screens and devices.

7.3.1.  .art-ascii-art

   Must use a mono-spaced font.

7.3.2.  .art-logo

   No visible changes to the natural language content; keep in default
   style.  Note that such images are not currently allowed in RFCs.

7.4.  .cref

   A comment within an I-D; should be visually distinct.

   For I-Ds only; not for RFCs.

7.5.  .crefAnchor

   A comment within an I-D; should be visually distinct.

   For I-Ds only; not for RFCs.

7.6.  .crefSource

   A comment within an I-D; should be visually distinct.

   For I-Ds only; not for RFCs.

7.7.  .dlCompact

   Use less spacing on a definition list than the default.

7.8.  .dlHanging

   Use the standard hanging indent for a definition list; indent terms.

7.9.  .dlParallel

   Do not use the standard hanging indent for a definition list; align
   terms and definitions along left side.

7.10.  .docInfo

   Hide from visible content.

7.11.  .eref

   Standard link formatting (underlined, change in color).

7.12.  .finalized

   Hide from visible content.

7.13.  .note

   Notes should be emphasized and distinct from normal paragraph text.

7.13.1.  .rfcEditorRemove

   An RFC Editor note may be added after the standard boilerplage.  It
   should be visually distinct to highlight final removal of the note by
   the RFC Editor.

7.14.  .olCompact

   Use less spacing on a numbered list than the default.

7.15.  .olPercent

   If the style attribute from the source XML contains a percent sign, a
   particular style setting will be required to make this setting behave
   like an HTML ordered list.

7.16.  .pilcrow

   Pilcrows, when used as described in draft-iab-html-rfc, should appear
   at the end of the paragraph, artwork, or sourcecode segment.  They
   should not appear until moused-over.  They should not show when
   printed, and should not be selected when copied with a copy/paste
   function.

7.17.  .relref

   Should be clearly distinguished as links.

7.18.  .rendered

   Hide from visible content.

Internet-Draft                     I-D                         July 2016


7.19.  .sourcecode

   Code examples or components should be in a fixed-width font if the
   human language used has an available fixed-width font option, and
   should be visually distinct.  If no fixed-width font is available,
   use the default font for that human language.

7.20.  .toc

   The table of contents should be clearly distinguished using an
   indented, ordered list with the list style set to 'none', allowing
   for hyperlinked, in-line dotted number notation (e.g., 1., 1.1.,
   1.1.1.).

7.21.  .type

   No visible changes to the natural language content; keep in default
   style.

7.22.  .ulCompact

   Use less spacing on a bulleted list than the default.

7.23.  .ulEmpty

   Indent from the margin of the previous paragraph.

7.24.  .url

   Should be clearly distinguished as links.

7.25.  .xref

   Should be clearly distinguished as links.

8.  Security Considerations

   Security vulnerabilities can be introduced through the CSS.  How much
   detail do we need to go into here to say "don't do foolish things and
   introduce security issues?"

9.  IANA Considerations

   This draft contains no action for IANA
