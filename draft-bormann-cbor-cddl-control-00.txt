1.  Introduction

   The Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL), standardized in RFC
   8610, provides "control operators" as its main language extension
   point.

   The present document defines a number of control operators that did
   not make it into RFC 8610:

         | .cat     | String Concatenation                      |
         +----------+-------------------------------------------+
         | .plus    | Numeric addition                          |
         +----------+-------------------------------------------+
         | .abnf    | ABNF in CDDL (text strings)               |

Internet-Draft           CDDL control operators                June 2020


1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This specification uses terminology from [RFC8610].  In particular,
   with respect to control operators, "target" refers to the left hand
   side operand, and "controller" to the right hand side operand.

2.  Computed Literals

   CDDL as defined in [RFC8610] does not have any mechanisms to compute
   literals.  As an 80 % solution, this specification adds two control
   operators: ".cat" for string concatenation, and ".plus" for numeric
   addition.

2.1.  String Concatenation

   It is often useful to be able to compose string literals out of
   component literals defined in different places in the specification.

   The ".cat" control identifies a string that is built from a
   concatenation of the target and the controller.  As targets and
   controllers are types, the resulting type is formally the cross-
   product of the two types, although not all tools may be able to work
   with non-unique targets or controllers.

   Target and controller MUST be strings.  If the target is a byte
   string and the controller a text string, or vice versa, the
   concatenation is performed on the bytes in both strings, and the
   result has the type (byte string or text string) of the target.

   a = "foo" .cat '
     bar
     baz
   '
   ; is the same string as:
   b = "foo\n  bar\n  baz\n"

          Figure 1: Example: concatenation of text and byte string

   The example in Figure 1 builds a text string named "a" out of
   concatenating the target text string ""foo"" and the controller byte
   string entered in a text form byte string literal.  (This particular
   idiom is useful when the text string contains newlines, which, as

   shown in the example for "b", may be harder to read when entered in
   the format that the pure CDDL text string notation inherits from
   JSON.)

2.2.  Numeric Addition

   In many cases in a specification, numbers are needed relative to a
   base number.  The ".plus" control identifies a number that is
   constructed by adding the numeric values of the target and of the
   controller.

   Target and controller MUST be numeric.  If the target is a floating
   point number and the controller an integer number, or vice versa, the
   sum is converted (possibly by selecting the next lower integer) into
   the type of the target.

   interval<BASE> = (
     BASE => int             ; lower bound
     (BASE .plus 1) => int   ; upper bound
     ? (BASE .plus 2) => int ; tolerance
   )

   X = 0
   Y = 3
   rect = {
     interval<X>
     interval<Y>
   }

                Figure 2: Example: addition to a base value

   The example in Figure 2 contains the generic definition of a group
   "interval" that gives a lower and an upper bound and optionally a
   tolerance. "rect" combines two of these groups into a map, one group
   for the X dimension and one for Y dimension.

3.  Embedded ABNF

   Many IETF protocols define allowable values for their text strings in
   ABNF [RFC5234] [RFC7405].  It is often desirable to define a text
   string type in CDDL by employing existing ABNF embedded into the CDDL
   specification.  Without specific ABNF support in CDDL, that ABNF
   would usually need to be translated into a regular expression (if
   that is even possible).

   ABNF can directly be added to CDDL in the same way that regular
   expressions were added: by defining a ".abnf" control operator.

   There are several small issues, with solutions given here:

   *  ABNF can be used to define byte sequences as well as UTF-8 text
      strings interpreted as Unicode scalar sequences.  This means this
      specification defines two control operators: ".abnfb" for ABNF
      denoting byte sequences and ".abnf" for denoting sequences of
      Unicode scalar values (codepoint) represented UTF-8 text strings.

   *  ABNF defines a list of rules, not a single expression (called
      "elements" in [RFC5234]).  This is resolved by requiring the
      control string to be one "element", followed by zero or more
      "rule".

   *  For the same reason, ABNF requires newlines; specifying newlines
      in CDDL text strings is tedious (and leads to essentially
      unreadable ABNF).  The workaround employs the ".cat" operator
      introduced in Section 2.1 and the syntax for text in byte strings.

   *  One set of rules provided in an ABNF specification is often used
      in multiple positions, in particular staples such as DIGIT and
      ALPHA.  The composition this calls for can also be provided by the
      ".cat" operator.

   These points, combined into an example in Figure 3, which uses ABNF
   from [RFC3339] to specify the CBOR tags defined in
   [I-D.ietf-cbor-date-tag].

4.  Features

   Traditionally, the kind of validation enabled by languages such as
   CDDL provided a Boolean result: valid, or invalid.

Internet-Draft           CDDL control operators                June 2020


   In rapidly evolving environments, this is too simplistic.  The data
   models described by a CDDL specification may continually be enhanced
   by additional features, and it would be useful even for a
   specification that does not yet describe a specific future feature to
   identify the extension point the feature can use, accepting such
   extensions while marking them as such.

   The ".feature" control annotates the target as making use of the
   feature named by the controller.  The latter will usually be a
   string.  A tool that validates an instance against that specification
   may mark the instance as using a feature that is annotated by the
   specification.

   Figure 4 shows what could be the definition of a person, with
   potential extensions beyond "name" and "organization" being marked
   "further-person-extension".  Extensions that are known at the time
   this definition is known can be collected into "$$person-extensions".
   However, future extensions would be deemed invalid unless the
   wildcard at the end of the map is added.  These extensions could then
   be specifically examined by a user or a tool that makes use of the
   validation result.

   Leaving out the entire extension point would mean that instances that
   make use of an extension would be marked as whole-sale invalid,
   making the entire validation approach much less useful.  Leaving the
   extension point in, but not marking its use as special, would render
   mistakes such as using the label "organisation" instead of
   "organization" invisible.

   person = {
     ? name: text
     ? organization: text
     $$person-extensions
     * (text .feature "further-person-extension") => any
   }

   $$person-extensions //= (? bloodgroup: text)

6.  Implementation Status

   An early implementation of the control operator ".feature" has been
   available in the CDDL tool since version 0.8.11.  The validator warns
   about each feature being used and provides the set of target values
   used with the feature.

7.  Security considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC8610] apply.
