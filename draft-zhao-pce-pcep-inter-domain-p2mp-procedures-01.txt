Abstract

   Point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE
   LSPs) may be established using signaling techniques, but their paths
   must first be determined.  The Path Computation Element (PCE) has
   been identified as an appropriate technology for the determination of
   the paths of P2MP TE LSPs.

   This document describes the procedures and extensions to the PCE
   communication Protocol (PCEP) to handle requests and responses for
   the computation of inter-domain paths for P2MP TE LSPs.

2.  Introduction

   Multicast services are increasingly in demand for high-capacity
   applications such as multicast VPNs, IPTV (on-demand or streaming),
   and content-rich media distribution (for example, software
   distribution, financial streaming, or data-sharing).  The inter-
   domain P2MP TE LSP is a feature that facilities the deployment and
   operation of these services across multi domains.

   The need to establish point-to-multipoint (P2MP) traffic engineered
   (TE) Label Switching Paths (LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching
   (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks is covered in [RFC4461].

   The applicability of the Path Computation Element (PCE) for the
   computation of such paths is discussed in [PCE-P2MP-APP], and the
   requirements placed on PCEP for this are given in [PCE-P2MP-REQ].
   
   This document defines a PCE-based solution which will compute the 
   optimal inter-domain P2MP TE LSP.

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Problem Statement

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) defined in [RFC4655] is an entity
   that is capable of computing a network path or route based on a
   network graph, and applying computational constraints.  A Path
   Computation Client (PCC) may make requests to a PCE for paths to be
   computed.

   [RFC4875] describes how to set up P2MP TE LSPs for use in MPLS GMPLS
   networks.

   The PCE is identified as a suitable application for the computation
   of paths for P2MP TE LSPs [PCE-P2MP-APP].

   The draft-ietf-pce-brpc-09.txt specifies a procedure relying on the
   use of multiple Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to compute point-to-
   point (P2P) inter-domain shortest constrained paths across a
   predetermined sequence of domains, using a backward recursive path
   computation technique.  The technique preserves confidentiality
   across domains, which is sometimes required when domains are managed
   by different Service Providers.

   The PCE communication protocol (PCEP) [RFC5440] is extended as a
   communication protocol between PCCs and PCEs for point-to-
   multipoint(P2MP) path computations and is defined in [PCE-P2MP-EXT].
   However, that specification does not provide a mechanism to request
   path computation of inter-domain P2MP TE LSPs.

   This document presents a solution, and procedures and extensions to
   PCEP to support P2MP inter-domain path computation.


4.  Assumptions

   It is assumed that due to deployment and commercial limitations
   (e.g.,inter-AS peering agreements) the sequence of domains for a path
   (the path domain tree) will be known in advance.

   The examples and scenarios used in this document are also based on
   the following assumptions:

   - The PCE that serves each domain in the path domain tree is known
   and the set of PCEs and their relationships is propagated to each PCE
   during the first exchange of path computation requests;

   - Each PCE knows about any leaf LSRs in the domain it serves;

   - The boundary nodes to use on the LSP are pre-determined and form
   path of the path domain tree.  In this version of the document we do
   not consider multi-homed domains.

5.  Requirements

   This section summarizes the PCEP requirements specific to computing
   inter-domain P2MP paths.  In these requirements we note that the
   actual computation times by any PCE implementation are outside the
   scope of this document, but we observe that reducing the complexity
   of the required computations has a beneficial effect on the
   computation time regardless of implementation.  Additionally,
   reducing the number of message exchanges and the amount of
   information exchanged willreduce the overall computation time for the
   entire P2MP tree.  We refer to the "Complexity of the computation" as
   the impact on these aspects of path computation time as various
   parameters of the topology and the P2MP LSP are changed.

   1.  The requirements specified in [RFC5376];

   1.1 PCEP must allow an SP to hide from other SPs the set of hops
   within its own ASes that are traversed by an inter-AS inter-provider
   TE LSP for each inter-AS TE LSP path segment an inter-AS PCE
   computes, it may return to the requesting inter-AS PCE an inter-AS TE
   LSP path segment from its own ASes without detailing the explicit
   intra-AS hops.

   2.  A number of additional requirements have also been identified in
   [RFC4461].

   3.  The computed P2MP LSP should be optimal when only considering The
   paths among the BNs.

   4.  Grafting and pruning of multicast destinations in a domain should
   have no impact on other domains and on the paths among BNs.

   5.  The complexity of the computing for each sub-tree within each
   domain should be only dependent on the topology of the domain and it
   should be independent of the domain sequences.

   6.  The number of PCEP request and reply messages should be
   independent of the number of multicast destinations in each domain.


6.  Objective Functions

   During the computation of a single or a set of P2MP TE LSPs a request
   to meet specific optimization criteria, called an Objective Function
   (OF), may be requested.

draft-zhao-pce-pcep-inter-domain-p2mp-procedures-01            July 2009


   The computation of one or more P2MP TE-LSPs maybe subject to an OF in
   order to select the "best" candidate paths.  A variety of objective
   functions have been identified as being important during the
   computation of inter-domain P2MP LSPs.  These are:

   1.  The sub-tree within each domain should be optimized.

   1.1 Minimum cost tree [PCE-P2MP-REQ].

   1.2 Shortest path tree [PCE-P2MP-REQ].

   2.  The P2MP LSP paths should be optimal while only considering the
   entry and exit nodes of each domain as the transit, branch and leaf
   nodes of the P2MP LSP path.  (That is, the Core Tree should be
   optimized.)

   3.  It should be possible to limit the number of entry points to a
   domain.

   4.  It should be possible to force the branches for all leaves within
   a domain to be in that domain.


7.  Protocol Procedures

   The following sections describe the procedures to satisfy the
   requirements specified in the previous section.

7.1.  Per Domain Path Computation

   Computing P2P LSPs individually is an acceptable solution for
   computing a P2MP tree.  Per domain path computation [RFC5152] can be
   used to compute P2P multi-domain paths, but it does not guarantee
   to find the optimal path which crosses multiple domains.
   Furthermore, constructing a P2MP tree from individual source to leaf
   P2P LSPs does not guarantee to produce a least-cost tree.
   This approach may be considered to have scaling issues during LSP
   setup.  That is, the LSP to each leaf is signaled separately, and
   each border node must perform path computation for each leaf. This 
   solution does suit simply-connected domains and where the preferred 
   points of interconnection are known.

7.2.  Backwards Recursive Path Computation

   Backward recursive path computation (BRPC) [RFC5441] provides a
   mechanism to compute optimal P2P LSPs.  This overcomes one of the
   issues raised in Section 3.1, but nevertheless, a P2MP tree
   constructed from individually computed optimal P2P LSPs does not
   guarantee to produce a least-cost tree; it does produce a least-cost-
   to-destination tree.

Zhao, et al.            Expires December 3, 2009                [Page 7]

draft-zhao-pce-pcep-inter-domain-p2mp-procedures-01            July 2009


   THis solution suits environments where multiple connections exist 
   between domains and there is no preference for the choice of points 
   of interconnection. This approach may have scaling issues during 
   path computation as each the path to each leaf must be computed 
   separately.  Although path fragments already used for other leaves 
   may be re-used by stateful PCEs, the information must still be 
   transmitted in a full exchange of PCEP messages for each leaf.

7.3.  Core Tree Based Path Computation

   A core tree based solution provides an optimal inter-domain P2MP TE
   LSP and meets the requirements and OFs outlined in previous sections.

   A core tree is a path tree with nodes from each domain corresponding
   to the PCE topology which satisfies the following conditions:

   - The root of the core tree is the ingress LSR in the root domain;

   - The leaf of the core tree is the entry node in the leaf domain;

   - The transit and branch nodes of the core tree are from the entry
   and exit nodes from the transit and branch domains.

   Computing the complete P2MP LSP path tree is done in two phases:

   Procedure Phase 1: Build the P2MP LSP Core Tree.

   The algorithms to compute the optimal large core tree are outside
   scope of this document.  In the case that the number of domains and
   the number of BNs are not big, the following extended BRPC based
   procedure can be used to compute the core tree.

   BRPC Based CoreTree Path Computation Procedure

   (1).  Using the BRPC procedures to compute the VSPT(i) for each leaf
   BN(i), i=1 to n, where n is the total number of entry nodes for all
   the leaf domains.  In each VSPT(i), there are a number of P(i) paths.

   (2).  When the root PCE has computed all the VSPT(i), i=1 to n, take
   one path from each VSPT and form a set of paths, we call it a
   PathSet(j), j=1 to M, where M=P(1)xP(2)...xP(n);

   (3).  For each PathSet(j), there are n S2L (Source to Leaf BN) paths 
   and form these n paths into a CoreTree(j);

   (4).  There will be M number of CoreTrees computed from step3.  Apply
   the OF to each of these M CoreTrees and find the optimal CoreTree.

draft-zhao-pce-pcep-inter-domain-p2mp-procedures-01            July 2009


   Procedure Phase 2: Grafting destinations to the P2MP LSP Core Tree.

   Once the core tree is built, the grafting of all the leaf nodes from
   each domain to the core tree can be achieved by a number of
   algorithms.  One algorithm for doing this phase is that the root PCE
   will send the request with C bit set for the path computation to the
   destination(s) directly to the PCE where the destination(s) belong(s)
   along with the core tree computed from the phase 1.


8.  Protocol Extensions for Core Tree Based Computation

   The following section describes the protocol extensions for Core Tree
   based inter-domain P2MP path calculation.

8.1.  The Extension of RP Object

   The extended format of the RP object body to include the C bit as
   follows:

   The C bit is added in the flag bits field of the RP object to signal
   the receiver of the message that the request/reply is for inter-
   domain P2MP coreTree or not.

         0: This indicates that this is normal PCReq/PCRrep for P2MP.

         1: This indicates that this is PCReq or PCRep message for
         inter-domain coreTree P2MP.  When the C bit is set, then the
         request message should have the coretree passed along with the
         destinations which are needed to be graphted.

8.2.  The PCE Sequence Object

   The PCE Sequence Object is added to the existing PCE protocol.  A
   list of this objects will represent the PCE topology tree.  A list of
   Sequence Objects can be exchanged between PCEs during the PCE
   capability exchange or on the first path computation request message
   between PCEs.  In this case, the request message format needs to be
   changed to include the list of PCE Sequence Objects for the PCE
   inter-domain P2MP calculation request.

   Each PCE Sequence can be obtained from the domain sequence for a
   specific path.  All the PCE sequences for all the paths of P2MP
   inter-domain form the PCE Topology Tree of the P2MP LSP.

   The format of the new PCE Sequence Object for IPv4 (Object-Type 3) is
   as follows:


       0                   1                   2                   3

9. Manageability Considerations

   [PCE-P2MP-REQ] describes various manageability requirements in
   support of P2MP path computation when applying PCEP.  This section
   describes how manageability requirements mentioned in [PCE-P2MP-REQ]
   are supported in the context of PCEP extensions specified in this
   document.

   Note that [RFC5440] describes various manageability considerations in
   PCEP, and most of manageability requirements mentioned in [PCE-P2MP
   P2MP] are already covered there.

9.1.  Control of Function and Policy

   In addition to configuration parameters listed in [RFC5440], the
   following parameters MAY be required.

   o  P2MP path computations enabled or disabled.

   o  Advertisement of P2MP path computation capability enabled or
      disabled (discovery protocol, capability exchange).

9.2. Information and Data Models

   As described in [PCE-P2MP-REQ], MIB objects MUST be supported for
   PCEP extensions specified in this document.

9.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   There are no additional considerations beyond those expressed in
   [RFC5440], since [PCE-P2MP-REQ] does not address any additional
   requirements.

9.4.  Verifying Correct Operation

   There are no additional considerations beyond those expressed in
   [RFC5440], since [PCE-P2MP-REQ] does not address any additional
   requirements.

9.5. Requirements on Other Protocols and Functional Components

   As described in [PCE-P2MP-REQ], the PCE MUST obtain information
   about the P2MP signaling and branching capabilities of each LSR in
   the network.

   Protocol extensions specified in this document does not provide such
   capability.  Other mechanisms MUST be present.

9.6. Impact on Network Operation

   It is expected that use of PCEP extensions specified in this document
   will not have significant impact on network operations.
      

10.  Security Considerations

   As described in [PCE-P2MP-REQ], P2MP path computation requests are
   more CPU-intensive and also use more link bandwidth.  Therefore, it
   may be more vulnerable to denial of service attacks. Therefore it is 
   more important that implementations conform to security requirements 
   of [RFC5440], and the implementor utilize those security features.


11.  IANA Considerations

   A number of IANA considerations have been highlighted in previous
   sections of this document. This section will highlight those 
   requests in future versions of this document.
