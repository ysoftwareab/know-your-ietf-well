1. Introduction

  This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
  for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
  In particular, it describes managed objects for the General Switch
  Management Protocol (GSMP).

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2. The SNMP Management Framework


  The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
  components:

  *  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

  *  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
     purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
     Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD
     16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 1215
     [RFC1215]. The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD
     58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and RFC 2580[RFC2580].

  *  Message protocols for transferring management information. The
     first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
     described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second version of the
     SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
     protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901] and
     RFC 1906 [RFC1906]. The third version of the message protocol is
     called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906], RFC 2572
     [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

  *  Protocol operations for accessing management information. The first
     set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described
     in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second set of operations and
     associated PDU formats is described in 1905 [RFC1905].

  *  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [RFC2573]
     and the view-based access control mechanism described RFC 2575
     [RFC2575].

Internet Draft                 GSMP MIB                     October 2001

  A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
  can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
  the Management Information Base or MIB. Objects in the MIB are
  defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

  This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
  MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
  translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
  equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
  translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
  information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
  SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
  readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
  MIB.

3. Structure of the MIB

  This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
  for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
  In particular, it describes managed objects for the General Switch
  Management Protocol (GSMP) as defined in [GSMPv3].

3.1 Overview

  The General Switch Management Protocol (GSMP) is a general purpose
  protocol to control a label switch. GSMP allows a controller to
  establish and release connections across the switch, to manage switch
  ports and to request configuration information or statistics. It also
  allows the switch to inform the controller of asynchronous events
  such as a link going down.

  The GSMP protocol is asymmetric, the controller being the master and
  the switch being the slave. Multiple switches may be controlled by a
  single controller using multiple instantiations of the protocol over
  separate control connections. Also a switch may be controlled by more
  than one controller by using the technique of partitioning..

  Each instance of a switch controller - switch partition adjacency is
  a session between one switch controller entity and one switch entity.
  The MIB provides objects to configure/setup these entities to form
  the GSMP sessions. It also provide objects to monitor these GSMP
  sessions.

3.2 Scope

  The GSMP mib is a protocol mib. It contains object to configure,
  monitor and maintain the GSMP protocol entity. It does not provide
  any information learned via the protocol, such as "all ports config"
  information.

  The relationships between virtual entities, such as Virtual Switch
  Entities, and entities, such as Switch Entities, falls outside of the
  management of GSMP. This also applies for the management of switch
  partitions. So this is excluded from the GSMP mib.

  It is possible to configure which and how many Switch Controllers
  that are controlling one Switch since every potential session with
  the switch has to be represented with an Switch entity. It is however
  not possible to define that one Switch Controller shouldn't allow
  other Switch controllers to control the same switch or partition on
  the switch. It is assumed that there are mechanisms that synchronise

  controllers and the configuration of them. This is outside the scope
  of this mib.

3.3 MIB guideline

  Two tables are used to configure potential GSMP sessions depending if
  you are acting as a GSMP switch controller or a GSMP switch. Each row
  in these tables initiates a GSMP session.

  The entity ID is a 48-bit name that is unique within the operational
  context of the device. A 48-bit IEEE 802 MAC address, if available,
  MAY be used for the entity ID. If the Ethernet encapsulation is used,
  the entity ID MUST be the IEEE 802 MAC address of the interface on
  which the GSMP session is to be setup.

  First the encapsulation the potential GSMP session shall be defined.
  If atm is used, a row in the gsmpAtmEncapTable has to be created with
  the index set to the entity ID. The specified resources should be
  allocated to GSMP. If tcp/ip is used, a row in the
  gsmpTcpIpEncapTable has to be created with the index set to the
  entity ID. The specified port shall be allocated to GSMP. No special
  action is needed if ethernet encapsulation is used.

  Then the entity information shall be defined. To create a Switch
  Entity, an entry in the gsmpSwitchTable is created with the index set
  to the entity ID. To create a Switch Controller Entity, an entry in
  the gsmpControllerTable is created with the index set to the entity
  ID.

  When the row status of the GsmpControllerEntry or GsmpSwitchEntry is
  set to active, and in the case with atm or tcp/ip there are active
  rows with corresponding entity ID, the adjacency protocol of GSMP is
  started.

  Another table, the gsmpSessionTable, shows the actual sessions that
  are established or are in the process of being established. Each row
  represents a specific session between an Entity and a peer. This
  table carries information about the peer, the session and parameters
  that was negotiated by the adjacency procedures. The
  gsmpSessionTable also contains statistical information regarding the
  session.

  This creation order SHOULD be used by all GSMP managers. This is to
  avoid clash situations in multiple SNMP manager scenarios where
  different managers may create competing entries in the different
  tables.

  Entities may very well be configured by other means than SNMP, e.g.
  cli command. Such configured entities SHOULD be represented as

  entries in the tables of this mib and SHOULD be possible to query and
  MAY be possible to alter with SNMP.

3.4 MIB groups

3.4.1 GSMP Switch Controller group

  The controller group is used to configure a potential GSMP session on
  a Switch Controller. A row in the gsmpControllerTable is created for
  each such session. If ATM or TCP/IP encapsulation is used a
  corresponding row has to be created in these tables before the
  session adjacency protocol is initiated.

  If ATM or TCP/IP is used, encapsulation data is defined in the
  corresponding encapsulation tables. If ethernet is used the MAC
  address of the interface defined for the session is set by the
  Controller ID object.

  The adjacency parameters are defined; such as
  - Max supported GSMP version
  - Time between the periodic adjacency messages
  - Controller local port number and instance number.
  - Whether partitions are being used and the partition ID for the
    specific partitions this controller is concerned with if
    partitions are used.
  - The resynchronisation strategy for the session is specified.

  The notification mapping is set to specify for with events the
  corresponding SNMP notifications are sent.

3.4.2 GSMP Switch group

  The switch group is used to configure a potential GSMP session on a
  Switch. A row in the gsmpSwitchTable is created for each such
  session. If ATM or TCP/IP encapsulation is used a corresponding row
  has to be created in these tables before the session adjacency
  protocol is initiated.

  If ATM or TCP/IP is used, encapsulation data is defined in the
  corresponding encapsulation tables. If ethernet is used the MAC
  address of the interface defined for the session is set by the Switch
  ID object.

  The adjacency parameters are defined; such as
  - Max supported GSMP version
  - Time between the periodic adjacency messages
  - Switch Name, local port number and instance number.
  - Whether partitions are being used and the partition ID for this
    specific partition if partitions are used.

  - The switch type could be set.
  - The suggested maximum window size for unacknowledged request
    messages.

  Also, a notification mapping is set to specify for with events the
  corresponding SNMP notifications are sent.

3.4.3 GSMP Encapsulation groups

  The ATM Encapsulation Table and the TCP/IP Encapsulation Table
  provides a way to configure information that are encapsulation
  specific. The encapsulation data is further specified in [GSMPenc].

  If ATM encapsulation is used, the interface and the virtual channel
  are specified.

  If TCP/IP is used, the IP address and the port number are specified.

  No special config data needed if Ethernet encapsulation is used.

  This mib MAY be extended with new, standard or proprietary, GSMP
  encapsulation types. If a new encapsulation type needs to be added,
  it SHOULD be done in the form of a new table with the entity ID as
  index. A row in that encapsulation table SHOULD be created before any
  row in an GSMP entity table are created that are using this new GSMP
  encapsulation.

3.4.4 GSMP General group

  The GSMP session table provides a way to monitor and maintain GSMP
  sessions.

  The session is defined by a Switch Controller Entity and Switch
  Entity pair.

3.4.5 The GSMP Notifications Group

  The GSMP Notification Group defines notifications for GSMP entities.
  These notifications provide a mechanism for a GSMP device to inform
  the management station of status changes. Also a notification is
  defined for each type of GSMP events.

  The group of notifications consists of the following notifications:

  - gsmpSessionDown

  This notification is generated when a session is terminating and also
  reports the final accounting statistics of the session.

Internet Draft                 GSMP MIB                     October 2001

  - gsmpSessionUp

  This notification is generated when a new session is established.

  - gsmpSendFailureInd

  This notification is generated when a message with a failure
  indication was sent. This means that this notification identifies a
  change to the gsmpSessionStatFailureInds object in a row of the
  gsmpSessionTable.

  - gsmpReceivedFailureInd

  This notification is generated when a message with a failure
  indication received. This means that this notification identifies a
  change to the gsmpSessionStatReceivedFailures object in a row of the
  gsmpSessionTable.

  - gsmpPortUpEvent

  This notification is generated when a Port Up Event is either
  received or sent.

  - gsmpPortDownEvent

  This notification is generated when a Port Down Event is either
  received or sent.

  - gsmpInvalidLabelEvent

  This notification is generated when an Invalid Label Event is either
  received or sent.

  - gsmpNewPortEvent

  This notification is generated when New Port Event either is received
  or sent.

  - gsmpDeadPortEvent

  This notification is generated when a Dead Port Event is either
  received or sent.

  - gsmpAdjacencyUpdateEvent

  This notification is generated when an Adjacency Update Event is
  either received or sent.

Internet Draft                 GSMP MIB                     October 2001

  To disable or enable sending of each notification is done by setting
  the bitmap accordingly in the Notification mapping objects in the
  Controller Entity or Switch Entity tables.

  The GSMP notification map capability should not be seen as a
  duplication of the filter mechanism in the snmp notification
  originator application [RFC2573], but as a compliment, to configure
  the relation between GSMP events and the SNMP notifications already
  in the GSMP agent. SNMP notifications and GSMP events operate
  sometimes on a different timescale, and it may in some applications
  be devastating for a SNMP application to receive events for each GSMP
  events. E.g. the invalid label event in a ATM switch scenario may
  cause mass SNMP notification flooding if mapped to a SNMP
  notification.

3.5 Textual Conventions

  The datatypes GsmpNameType, GsmpLabelType, GsmpVersion, 
  GsmpPartitionType and GsmpPartitionIdType are used as textual 
  conventions in this document. These textual conventions are used for 
  the convenience of humans reading the MIB. Objects defined using 
  these conventions are always encoded by means of the rules that 
  define their primitive type. However, the textual conventions have 
  special semantics associated with them. Hence, no changes to the SMI 
  or the SNMP are necessary to accommodate these textual conventions 
  which are adopted merely for the convenience of readers.

  Besides from editorial changes the following updates was made;
  - Imported AtmVcIdentifier, AtmVpIdentifier FROM ATM-TC-MIB
  - Removed serviceModelType
  - Separated the Vse and Vsce config stuf in separate tables.
  - Also added ATM,TCP/IP, Vse and Vsce groups
  - Added control of multiple controllers
  - Added Vse window size and switch type configuration.
  - Added control of resync strategy
  - Added last failure code and discontinuity time
  - Added event config and count
  - Added notifications

5.3 Changes from < draft-ietf-gsmp-mib-02.txt >

  Besides from editorial changes the following updates was made;
  - Added gsmpThisSideId and gsmpFarSideId helper objects.
  - Replaced Ipv4 address type with TC for Internet Network
    Addresses
  - Added textual conventions for reader convenience.
  - Removed gsmpVsceName object and added default behaviour of
    gsmpVseName
  - Added row status objects for the encap tables.
  - Added DEFVAL and ranges to objects.
  - Persistent storage clarified
  - "Virtual" removed from names and concepts. gsmpVsceTable now
    gsmpControllerTable and gsmpVseTable is gsmpSwitchTable.
  - Partition Type object added.
  - Session state moved from Session table to Controller and
    Switch tables.
  - Removed gsmpSwitchAllowMultContr object, it's redundant.

8. Security Considerations

  Assuming that secure network management (such as SNMP v3) is
  implemented, the objects represented in this MIB do not pose a threat
  to the security of the network.

  There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
  have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. Such
  objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
  environments. The support for SET operations in a non-secure
  environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
  network operations.

  There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain
  sensitive information. These are contained in the gsmpControllerTable
  and gsmpSwitchTable. It is thus important to control even GET access
  to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these
  object when sending them over the network via SNMP. Not all versions
  of SNMP provide features for such a secure environment.

  SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the network
  itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
  control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
  GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

  It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
  features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically, the use
  of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-
  based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.

  It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
  entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
  configured to give access to the objects only to those principals

  (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
  (change/create/delete) them.
