Internet-Draft                  Pairtree                   November 2008


Abstract

   This document specifies Pairtree, a filesystem hierarchy for holding
   objects that are located within that hierarchy by mapping identifier
   strings to object directory (or folder) paths two characters at a
   time.  If an object directory (folder) holds all the files, and
   nothing but the files, that comprise the object, a "pairtree" can be
   imported by a system that knows nothing about the nature or structure
   of the objects but can still deliver any object's files by requested
   identifier.  The mapping is reversible, so the importing system can
   also walk the pairtree and reliably enumerate all the contained
   object identifiers.  To the extent that object dependencies are
   stored inside the pairtree (e.g., fast indexes stored outside contain
   only derivative data), simple or complex collections built on top of
   pairtrees can recover from index failures and reconstruct a
   collection view simply by walking the trees.  Pairtrees have the
   advantage that many object operations, including backup and restore,
   can be performed with native operating system tools.

1.  The basic pairtree algorithm

   The pairtree algorithm maps an arbitrary UTF-8 [RFC3629] encoded
   identifier string into a filesystem directory path based on
   successive pairs of characters, and also defines the reverse mapping
   (from pathname to identifier).

   In this document the word "directory" is used interchangeably with
   the word "folder" and all examples conform to Unix-based filesystem
   conventions which should tranlate easily to Windows conventions after
   substituting the path separator ('\' instead of '/').  Pairtree
   places no limitations on file and path lengths, so implementors
   thinking about maximal interoperation may wish to consider the issues
   listed in the Interoperability section of this document.

   The mapping from identifier string to path has two parts.  First, the
   string is cleaned by converting characters that would be illegal or
   especially problemmatic in Unix or Windows filesystems.  The cleaned
   string is then split into pairs of characters, each of which becomes
   a directory name in a filesystem path: successive pairs map to
   successive path components until there are no characters left, with
   the last component being either a 1- or 2-character directory name.
   The resulting path is known as a _pairpath_, or _ppath_.

   abcd      -> ab/cd/
   abcdefg   -> ab/cd/ef/g/
   12-986xy4 -> 12/-9/86/xy/4/

   Armed with specific knowledge of a given namespace's identifier
   distribution, one might achieve more balanced or efficient trees by
   mapping to paths from character groupings other than successive
   pairs.  Pairtree assumes that this sort of optimization, however,
   being tailored to individual and transient namespace conditions, is
   often less important than having a single generalized and shareable
   mapping.  It uses pairs of characters to achieve hierarchies that
   exhibit a reasonable balance of path length and fanout (number of
   probable entries in any component directory).

2.  Pairpath termination and object encapsulation

   A ppath (pairpath) terminates when it reaches an object.  A little
   jargon helps explain this.  A _shorty_ is a 1- or 2-character
   directory name, or any file or directory name that begins with
   "pairtree" (these are reserved for future use).  A ppath consists of
   a sequence of "shorties" ending in a non-shorty, such as a
   3-character directory name or the 2-character file name "xy".  The
   pairtree below contains two objects with identifiers "abcd" and
   "abcde".

   ab/
   |
   \--- cd/
        |
        |--- foo/
        |    |   README.txt
        |    |   thumbnail.gif
        |    |
        |    |--- master_images/
        |    |    |   ...
        |    |    ...
        |    |
        |    \--- gh/
        |
        \--- e/
             |
             \--- bar/
                  |   metadata
                  |   54321.wav
                  |   index.html

   An object is reached when a non-shorty is detected.  An object is
   _properly encapsulated_ if it is entirely contained in a non-shorty
   directory that is the immediate child of a shorty directory, in other
   words, if the 1- or 2-char directory name ending the object's ppath
   contains exactly one non-shorty directory that holds all the object's
   descendants.  The two objects "abcd" and "abcde" above are properly
   encapsulated.  Any shorty directory found at the same level as the
   non-shorty extends the pairtree.  So while the "foo/" directory above
   does not subsume "e/" at the same level, by encapsulation, it does
   subsume the "gh/" underneath it (i.e., "gh/" is invisible to the
   pairtree algorithm, at least on a first pass).

   Practice will vary according to local custom as to how to name the
   encapsulating object directory beneath that last shorty.  Its name is
   completely independent of the object identifier.  For example, every
   object directory in a pairtree could have the uniform name "thingy".

   It is common for the directory name to be a terminal substring of the
   object identifier, as in:

      id:  13030_45xqv_793842495
   ppath:  13/03/0_/45/xq/v_/79/38/42/49/5/793842495

   All objects should be properly encapsulated.  If an object is
   detected that is _improperly encapsulated_, that is, when a ppath
   ends with a shorty directory that contains more than one non-shorty,
   the detecting system should take corrective action.  In this
   situation, also known as a "split end", all those non-shorties
   (directories and files) are considered to belong to one object (not
   properly encapsulated) identified by the containing ppath.  Excluding
   shorties from the object permits one identifier to be a substring of
   another (e.g., "abcd" and "abcde" can co-exist in a pairtree), and
   defining ppath termination in this way prevents "hidden riders", or
   data residing in a pairtree that is not contained or accounted for in
   any object.  Here is an example of an improperly encapsulated object
   named "bent".

             |   ...

   If a "split end" is encountered, an importing system is encouraged to
   normalize it by creating a single object directory called "obj" and
   pushing the non-shorties in question underneath it, as in:

   be/
   |
   \--- nt/
        |
        |--- obj/        [ split end repaired with "obj" directory ]

3.  Identifier string cleaning

   Prior to splitting into character pairs, identifier strings are
   cleaned in two separate steps.  One step would be simpler, but
   pairtree is designed so that commonly used characters in reasonably
   opaque identifiers (e.g., not containing natural language words,
   phrases, or hints) result in reasonably short and familiar-looking
   paths.  For completeness, the pairtree algorithm specifies what to do
   with all possible UTF-8 characters, and relies for this on a kind of
   URL hex-encoding.  To avoid conflict with URLs, pairtree hex-encoding
   is introduced with the '^' character instead of '%'.

   First, the identifier string is cleaned of characters that are
   expected to occur rarely in object identifiers but that would cause
   certain known problems for file systems.  In this step, every UTF-8
   octet outside the range of visible ASCII (94 characters with
   hexadecimal codes 21-7e) [ASCII], as well as the following visible
   ASCII characters,

      "   hex 22           <   hex 3c           \   hex 5c
      *   hex 2a           =   hex 3d           ^   hex 5e
      +   hex 2b           >   hex 3e           |   hex 7c
      ,   hex 2c           ?   hex 3f

   must be converted to their corresponding 3-character hexadecimal
   encoding, ^hh, where ^ is a circumflex and hh is two hex digits.  For
   example, ' ' (space) is converted to ^20 and '*' to ^2a.

   In the second step, the following single-character to single-
   character conversions must be done.

      / -> =
      : -> +
      . -> ,

   These are characters that occur quite commonly in opaque identifiers
   but present special problems for filesystems.  This step avoids
   requiring them to be hex encoded (hence expanded to three
   characters), which keeps the typical ppath reasonably short.  Here
   are examples of identifier strings after cleaning and after ppath
   mapping.

   terribly inconvenient for mainstream Unix and Windows systems, for
   their command interpreters, and as web-exposed URL paths.

4.  Pairpath initiation

   The top of a pairtree hierarchy is signaled by the presence of a
   directory called "pairtree_root".  There may be other filenames
   beginning with "pairtree" accompanying it, as in the example below.
   Lines of file content, when shown, appear in parentheses beneath the
   file name.

 current_directory/
 |   pairtree_version0_1        [which version of pairtree]
 |    ( This directory conforms to Pairtree Version 0.1. Updated spec: )
 |    ( http://www.cdlib.org/inside/diglib/pairtree/pairtreespec.html  )
 |
 |   pairtree_prefix
 |    ( http://n2t.info/ark:/13030/xt2                                 )
 |
 \--- pairtree_root/
      |--- aa/
      |    |--- cd/
      |    |    |--- foo/
      |    |    |    |   README.txt
      |    |    |    |   thumbnail.gif
      |    |    ...
      |    |--- ab/ ...
      |    |--- af/ ...
      |    |--- ag/ ...
      |    ...
      |--- ab/ ...
      ...
      \--- zz/ ...
           | ...

   The "pairtree_prefix" contains a string that should be prepended to
   every identifier inferred from the pairtree rooted at
   "pairtree_root".  This may be used to reduce path lengths when every
   identifier in a given pairtree shares the same initial substring.  In
   the example above, the pairpath "/aa/cd/" would thus correspond to
   the identifier "http://n2t.info/ark:/13030/xt2aacd".

5.  Pairtree benefits

   Pairtree can be used with any object identifier, but its real
   strength comes when two main assumptions are also in effect.  The
   first assumption is that every component on which an object depends
   will be stored in the filesystem.  Increasingly, digital library
   systems recognize that the risk of scattering components among
   databases and files can be reduced when all primary data is kept in
   non-volatile storage that can be backed up and manipulated using
   core, ubiquitous operating system tools.  While database indexes are
   important for supporting fast or complex query execution, this pre-
   condition merely requires that those indexes hold secondary copies of
   object components (e.g., metadata).

   The second assumption is that all the components of an object, and
   only the components of that object, are stored in an object's
   directory.  Thus an object's directory contains no components
   belonging to another object.  Of course complex objects will still
   contain other objects, and possibly other pairtrees, but such object
   containment is not visible to the pairtree algorithm except with a
   recursive pass.

   With these two pre-conditions met, a pairtree can be imported by a
   system that knows nothing about the nature or structure of the
   objects but can still deliver any object's files by requested
   identifier.  The mapping is reversible, so the importing system can
   also walk the pairtree and reliably enumerate all the contained
   object identifiers.  To the extent that object dependencies are
   stored inside the pairtree, simple or complex collections built on
   top of pairtrees can recover from index failures and reconstruct a
   collection catalog simply by walking the trees.  Finally, pairtrees
   have the advantage that many object operations, including backup and
   restore, can be performed with native operating system tools.

6.  Interoperability: Windows and Unix File Naming

   Besides the fundamental difference between path separators ('\' and
   '/'), generally, Windows filesystems have more limitations than Unix
   filesystems.  Windows path names have a maximum of 255 characters,
   and none of these characters may be used in a path component:

       < > : " / | ? *

   Windows also reserves the following names: CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM1,
   COM2, COM3, COM4, COM5, COM6, COM7, COM8, COM9, LPT1, LPT2, LPT3,
   LPT4, LPT5, LPT6, LPT7, LPT8, and LPT9.  See [MSFNAM] for more
   information.

7.  Security Considerations

   Pairtree poses no direct risk to computers and networks.  As a
   filesystem format, pairtree is capable of holding files that might
   contain malicious executable content, but it is no more vulnerable in
   this regard than formats such as TAR and ZIP.

Appendix A.  Sample Implementation

   There is a [PAIRTREE] Perl module at CPAN the implements two
   mappings.  The routine, id2ppath, maps an identifier to a pairpath,
   and another routine, ppath2id, performs the inverse mapping.  The
   usage synopsis follows.

   use File::Pairtree;           # imports routines into a Perl script

   id2ppath($id);                # returns pairpath corresponding to $id
   ppath2id($path);              # returns id corresponding to $path
