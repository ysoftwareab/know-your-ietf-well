Internet-Draft     IGMP & MLD Snooping Yang Module     October 08, 2021

1. Introduction

This document defines a YANG [RFC7950] data model for the management of
Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and Multicast Listener
Discovery (MLD) Snooping [RFC4541] devices.

The YANG module in this document conforms to the Network Management
Datastore Architecture defined in [RFC8342]. The "Network Management
Datastore Architecture" (NMDA) adds the ability to inspect the current
operational values for configuration, allowing clients to use identical
paths for retrieving the configured values and the operational values.

1.1. Terminology

The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in [RFC6020]

and [RFC7950], including:

  *  augment

  *  data model

  *  data node

  *  identity

  *  module

The following terminologies are used in this document:

  *  mrouter: multicast router, which is a router that has multicast
routing enabled [RFC4286].

  *  mrouter interfaces: snooping switch ports where multicast routers
are attached [RFC4541].

The following abbreviations are used in this document and defined model:

  IGMP: Internet Group Management Protocol [RFC3376].

  MLD:  Multicast Listener Discovery [RFC3810].

1.2. Tree Diagrams

Tree diagrams used in this document follow the notation defined in

[RFC8340].

1.3. Prefixes in Data Node Names

In this document, names of data nodes, actions, and other data model
objects are often used without a prefix, as long as it is clear from the
context in which YANG module each name is defined. Otherwise, names are
prefixed using the standard prefix associated with the corresponding
YANG module, as shown in Table 1.

2. Design of Data Model

An IGMP/MLD snooping switch [RFC4541] analyzes IGMP/MLD packets and sets
up forwarding tables for multicast traffic. If a switch does not run
IGMP/MLD snooping, multicast traffic will be flooded in the broadcast
domain. If a switch runs IGMP/MLD snooping, multicast traffic will be
forwarded based on the forwarding tables to avoid wasting bandwidth. The
IGMP/MLD snooping switch does not need to run any of the IGMP/MLD
protocols. Because the IGMP/MLD snooping is independent of the IGMP/MLD
protocols, the data model defined in this document does not augment, or
even require, the IGMP/MLD data model defined in [RFC8652].
The model covers considerations for Internet Group Management Protocol
(IGMP) and Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) Snooping Switches
[RFC4541].

IGMP and MLD snooping switches do not adhere to the conceptual model
that provides the strict separation of functionality between different

communications layers in the ISO model, and instead utilize information
in the upper level protocol headers as factors to be considered in
processing at the lower levels [RFC4541].

IGMP Snooping switches utilize IGMP, and could support IGMPv1 [RFC1112],
IGMPv2 [RFC2236], and IGMPv3 [RFC3376]. MLD Snooping switches utilize
MLD, and could support MLDv1 [RFC2710] and MLDv2 [RFC3810]. The goal of
this document is to define a data model that provides a common user
interface to IGMP and MLD Snooping.

2.1. Overview

The IGMP and MLD Snooping YANG module defined in this document has all
the common building blocks for the IGMP and MLD Snooping switches.

The YANG module includes IGMP and MLD Snooping instance definition,
using instance in the L2 service type of BRIDGE [dot1Qcp]. It also
includes actions for clearing IGMP and MLD Snooping group tables.

The YANG module doesn't cover L2VPN, which will be specified in a
separated document.

2.2. Optional Capabilities

This model is designed to represent the basic capability subsets of IGMP
and MLD Snooping. The main design goals of this document are that the
basic capabilities described in the model are supported by any major
now-existing implementation, and that the configuration of all
implementations meeting the specifications is easy to express through
some combination of the optional features in the model and simple vendor
augmentations.

There is also value in widely supported features being standardized, to
provide a standardized way to access these features, to save work for
individual vendors, and so that mapping between different vendors'
configuration is not needlessly complicated. Therefore, this model
declares a number of features representing capabilities that not all
deployed devices support.

The extensive use of feature declarations should also substantially
simplify the capability negotiation process for a vendor's IGMP and MLD
Snooping implementations.

On the other hand, operational state parameters are not so widely
designated as features, as there are many cases where the defaulting
of an operational state parameter would not cause any harm to the
system, and it is much more likely that an implementation without
native support for a piece of operational state would be able to derive
a suitable value for a state variable that is not natively supported.

2.3. Position of Address Family in Hierarchy

IGMP Snooping only supports IPv4, while MLD Snooping only supports IPv6.
The data model defined in this document can be used for both IPv4 and
IPv6 address families.

This document defines IGMP Snooping and MLD Snooping as separate schema
branches in the structure. The benefits are:

*  The model can support IGMP Snooping (IPv4), MLD Snooping (IPv6), or
both optionally and independently. Such flexibility cannot be achieved
cleanly with a combined branch.

*  The structure is consistent with other YANG data models such as
[RFC8652], which uses separate branches for IPv4 and IPv6.

*  Having separate branches for IGMP Snooping and MLD Snooping allows
minor differences in their behavior to be modelled more simply and
cleanly. The two branches can better support different features and node
types.



3. Module Structure

This model augments the core routing data model specified in [RFC8349].

      +--rw routing
         +--rw router-id?
         +--rw control-plane-protocols

         |     +--rw mld-snooping-instance  <= Augmented by this Model
                        ...
The "igmp-snooping-instance" container instantiates an IGMP Snooping
Instance. The "mld-snooping-instance" container instantiates an MLD
Snooping Instance.

The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network
Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342]. The operational
state data is combined with the associated configuration data in the
same hierarchy [RFC8407].

3.1. IGMP Snooping Instances

The YANG module ietf-igmp-mld-snooping augments /rt:routing/rt:control-
plane-protocols/rt:control-plane-protocol to add the igmp-snooping-
instance container.

Internet-Draft     IGMP & MLD Snooping Yang Module     October 08, 2021

All the IGMP Snooping related attributes have been defined in the igmp-
snooping-instance. The read-write attributes represent configurable
data. The read-only attributes represent state data.

One igmp-snooping-instance could be used in one BRIDGE [dot1Qcp]
instance, and it corresponds to one BRIDGE instance.

Currently the value of l2-service-type in igmp-snooping-instance could
only be set bridge. After it is set, igmp-snooping-instance could be
used in the BRIDGE service.

The values of bridge-mrouter-interface is filled by the snooping device
dynamically. It is different from static-bridge-mrouter-interface which
is configured.

The attributes under the interfaces show the statistics of IGMP Snooping
related packets.

3.2. MLD Snooping Instances

The YANG module ietf-igmp-mld-snooping augments /rt:routing/rt:control-
plane-protocols/rt:control-plane-protocol to add the mld-snooping-
instance container. The mld-snooping-instance could be used in the
BRIDGE [dot1Qcp] service to enable MLD Snooping.

All the MLD Snooping related attributes have been defined in the mld-
snooping-instance. The read-write attributes represent configurable
data. The read-only attributes represent state data.

Internet-Draft     IGMP & MLD Snooping Yang Module     October 08, 2021

The mld-snooping-instance has similar structure as IGMP snooping. Some
of leaves are protocol related. The mld-snooping-instance uses IPv6
addresses and mld-version, while igmp-snooping-instance uses IPv4
addresses and igmp-version. Statistic counters in each of the above
snooping instances are also tailored to the specific protocol type. One
mld-snooping-instance could be used in one BRIDGE instance, and it
corresponds to one BRIDGE instance.

Currently the value of l2-service-type in mld-snooping-instance could
only be set bridge. After it is set, mld-snooping-instance could be used
in the BRIDGE service.

The value of bridge-mrouter-interface is filled by the snooping device
dynamically. It is different from static-bridge-mrouter-interface which
is configured.

The attributes under the interfaces show the statistics of MLD Snooping
related packets.

3.3. Using IGMP and MLD Snooping Instances

The igmp-snooping-instance could be used in the service of BRIDGE
[dot1Qcp] to configure the IGMP Snooping.

For the BRIDGE service this model augments /dot1q:bridges/dot1q:bridge
to use igmp-snooping-instance. It means IGMP Snooping is enabled in the
whole bridge.

It also augments /dot1q:bridges/dot1q:bridge/dot1q:component/
dot1q:bridge-vlan/dot1q:vlan to use igmp-snooping-instance. It means
IGMP Snooping is enabled in the specified VLAN on the bridge.

The mld-snooping-instance could be used in concurrence with igmp-
snooping-instance to configure the MLD Snooping.

     augment /dot1q:bridges/dot1q:bridge:
       +--rw igmp-snooping-instance?   igmp-mld-snooping-instance-ref

3.4. IGMP and MLD Snooping Actions

IGMP and MLD Snooping actions clear the specified IGMP and MLD Snooping
group tables. If both source X and group Y are specified, only source X
from group Y in that specific instance will be cleared.

5. Security Considerations

The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such as
NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040]. The lowest NETCONF layer is the
secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport
is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242]. The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and
the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS [RFC8446].

The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341] provides
the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to
a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
operations and content.

There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the default).
These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
network environments. Write operations (e.g., edit-config) to these data
nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect on network
operations. These are the subtrees and data nodes and their
sensitivity/vulnerability:

Under /rt:routing/rt:control-plane-protocols/rt:control-plane-protocol:/

ims:igmp-snooping-instance

The subtrees under /dot1q:bridges/dot1q:bridge

The subtrees under /dot1q:bridges/dot1q:bridge/dot1q:component
/dot1q:bridge-vlan/dot1q:vlan

ims:igmp-snooping-instance

ims:mld-snooping-instance

Unauthorized access to any data node of these subtrees can adversely
affect the IGMP & MLD Snooping subsystem of both the local device and
the network. This may lead to network malfunctions, delivery of packets
to inappropriate destinations, and other problems.

Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus
important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
notification) to these data nodes. These are the subtrees and data nodes
and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

Under /rt:routing/rt:control-plane-protocols/rt:control-plane-protocol:/

ims:igmp-snooping-instance

ims:mld-snooping-instance

Unauthorized access to any data node of these subtrees can disclose the
operational state information of IGMP & MLD Snooping on this device. The
group/source/host information may expose multicast group memberships,
and transitively the associations between the user on the host and the
contents from the source which could be privately sensitive. Some of the
action operations in this YANG module may be considered sensitive or
vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus important to control
access to these operations. These are the operations and their
sensitivity/vulnerability:

Under /rt:routing/rt:control-plane-protocols/rt:control-plane-protocol:/

ims:igmp-snooping-instance/ims:clear-igmp-snooping-groups

ims:mld-snooping-instance/ims:clear-mld-snooping-groups

Internet-Draft     IGMP & MLD Snooping Yang Module     October 08, 2021

Some of the actions in this YANG module may be considered sensitive or
vulnerable in some network environments. The IGMP & MLD Snooping YANG
module supports the "clear-igmp-snooping-groups" and "clear-mld-
snooping-groups" actions. If unauthorized action is invoked, the IGMP
and MLD Snooping group tables will be cleared unexpectedly. Especially
when using wildcard, all the multicast traffic will be flooded in the
broadcast domain. The devices that use this YANG module should heed the
Security Considerations in [RFC4541].
