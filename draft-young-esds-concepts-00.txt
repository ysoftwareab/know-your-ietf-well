   Supply-chain Discovery Service (ESDS), an application layer protocol
   for the distributed sharing and discovery of notification events
   between associated partners within a supply chain.  Specified as a
   web service interface, the protocol defines event tracking and
   tracing operations as well as core object management operations.

Internet-Draft                ESDS Concepts                   April 2007


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the concepts related to the application layer
   protocol called the Extensible Supply-chain Discovery Service (ESDS).
   The ESDS captures and queries historical events related to specific
   objects with attached object identifiers, such as those programmed
   into RFID (radio frequency identifier) tags.  The interface enables
   disparate applications to track and trace shared life cycle views of
   object identifiers across a supply chain.  Additionally, the ESDS
   provides referral services in a loosely coupled mechanism with
   granular security that enables selective visibility.

   An object identifier represents an object (or a group of objects)
   that exists or has previously existed within a supply chain.  Each
   object identifier has a life cycle defined by a set of events and
   associated services for those events.  Each event includes a
   timestamp that enables a historical view of events over time.

   The ESDS is agnostic to both the object identifier type and string
   syntax, thus supporting a wide base of identifier representations.
   An example of an object identifier could be an RFID EPC (Electronic
   Product Code) in EPCglobal TDT (Tag Data Translation) URI notation
   TDT1.0 [TDT1.0].

   For details and examples of the operation interface of the ESDS
   protocol, see Extensible Supply-chain Discovery Service Schema
   [draft-thompson-esds-commands].  Extensible Supply-chain Discovery
   Service Schema [draft-thompson-esds-schema] details the schema for
   the ESDS, which is specified in Web Service Description Language
   (WSDL) and XML Schema (XSD).

1.1.  Background

   Supply chain communication traffic over the Internet is in common use
   for B2B (business to business).  Data exchange has traditionally
   taken the form of flat file data exchange, XML, and other proprietary
   forms across existing mechanisms, such as SFTP and SMTP.  This method
   of exchange requires bilateral agreements and networking arrangements
   amongst all partners of a given supply chain.  In this model,
   information sharing begins with the supply chain partner who provides
   lists of the objects (shipping manifest) that the other partners can
   expect to exchange within the supply chain.  While this one way
   method is effective in very static supply chain relationships, its
   main drawback lies in dynamic routing and, therefore, exception
   handling.  For example, if an object arrived at supply chain partner
   C without prior notification from supply chain partner B or A, the
   product remains unidentified and not routable.

Internet-Draft                ESDS Concepts                   April 2007


   With the advent of RFID tags as a catalyst, a desire to reverse-
   lookup the object information is evolving.  Products are being tagged
   with RFIDs, traditional barcodes, and other types of proprietary
   object identifiers.  The exchange of information now begins with the
   object and leads back to the supply chain partner.  As the object is
   scanned at various key gates in the supply chain, a referral service
   must be available to match the object's identifier to either a
   relevant supply chain partner or a list of relevant supply chain
   partners and the available data services these partners may offer to
   a requestor.  This enables supply chains to route flexibly and handle
   exceptions.

1.2.  Public Networks and Tree-Walking Concerns

   Currently another standards body, EPCGlobal, has issued a related
   draft standard referred to as ONS (Object Naming Service).  ONS is
   effectively an extended version of DNS that does not benefit from the
   IETF process and, by design, necessitates increased tree-walking.  As
   a stateful and unauthenticated service, the hierarchal ONS would need
   to be constantly updated to indicate incremental supply chain partner
   referrals, reducing the effectiveness of caching.  Even a relatively
   static entry, which could only refer to the point of origin within
   the supply chain, would drive the number of public zone entries to
   extremely large numbers.  Although EPCglobal has offered an alternate
   root system to assist with this problem, cost incentives are such
   that implementers will almost certainly use the Internet.  Already
   there has been a pilot ONS implementation under the .aero zone
   (sgtin.id.ons.autoid.aero) where this can be observed.

   ESDS seeks to prevent this problem by keeping most of the network
   traffic off the Internet root hierarchy.  It provides a relatively
   flat, authenticated lookup system that is incrementally updatable by
   its known participants.  ONS still comes into play, but only as an
   exception process.  Should no relevant event records to an object be
   posted through the ESDS, then a subsequent lookup to ONS could
   provide a referral to the start of a given supply chain.  However,
   now the ONS becomes a secondary, not a primary use lookup resolving
   the traffic concerns on the root hierarchy.  Additionally, since ESDS
   is a single point of authority, it provides the ability to reference
   multiple past events for a given object (in a single query) and does
   not necessitate iterative queries for past service referrals.

2.  Protocol Objects

   The ESDS defines the following protocol objects in order to provide
   the granular permission system that grants access to business event
   data generated in the process of tracking objects and services in a
   supply chain.  A supply chain represents a group of partners that
   will be sharing event information generated within that group.
   Partners grant or deny access to event data by assigning roles to
   particular users associated with partners in the supply chain.  The
   following protocol objects are described in more detail below:
   SupplyChain, Partner, User, Role, and Event.

2.1.  SupplyChain

   A supply chain is a logical group of partners that can share business
   event data generated within the group.  A partner's data can be made
   visible to other partners in the supply chain based on the access
   rules defined in the Security Considerations section of this
   document.

2.2.  Partner

   A partner is a business entity whose computer systems or employees
   may post events associated with a supply chain via an authenticated
   user.  Partners may inquire about events posted to any one of the
   supply chains they are members of, but will only receive results for
   events they are authorized to access.  A partner may belong to more
   than one supply chain and can create and set policies for a given
   supply chain.

2.3.  User

   Each agent associated with a partner is called a user, which may
   represent either a computer system or a person that acts on behalf of
   the partner.  A user is assigned a role that dictates what operations
   the user may invoke.  The ESDS may require partners to provide
   different access credentials for each user that connects to the
   discovery service.  When a partner's computer system initiates a
   connection to the ESDS on behalf of a person, that system must
   solicit the person's access credentials and provide them to the ESDS.
   A user can belong to only one partner.

2.4.  Role

   A role is an object used to define the permissions that are to be
   assigned to a user for the duration of an authenticated session.  A
   user MUST have exactly one role assigned to it.

2.5.  Event

   An event represents a new step in the life cycle of a tracked object
   or service.  It carries a time stamp indicating the instant
   (<sourceTS>) at which the event was generated by the client system
   and injected into ESDS.  There are two types of events:

   o  An <objectEvent> is captured when the system records a new life
      cycle step for an object bearing a given identifier (<objectID>).
      The event consists of a supply chain specific life cycle step
      (<lifeCycleStepID>).

   o  A <voidEvent> amends a specific event to indicate that the event
      was posted in error.  The voided event will no longer appear in
      event queries.  Every <voidEvent> specifies an <eventID> and a
      <reason> for the void, which is a freeform text string.
