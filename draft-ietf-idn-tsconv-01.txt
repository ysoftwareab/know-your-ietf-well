Preface

This article revise TSCONV-00 to give more detail about:
1. User requirements for TC/SC conversion of Chinese Domain Name.
2. Implementation of TC/SC conversion of Chinese Domain Name with 
   AMC-ACE-Z extension.
3. Updated 1-1 TC/SC conversion table (1-1 Chinese variant table), 
   which should be confirmed by CJK folks.
[Editor's note: As Chinese character's in common use by CJK people, 
so such table may be modified after making consensus with language 
experts of CJK area.]

To emphasis firstly, TC/SC conversion is just a fixed glossary for 
Chinese, it doesn't mean "mapping TC to SC or mapping SC to TC 
unilaterally" but "matching in comparison of DNS system". Please refer
to section 1 for more.

This article describes the history, actual status of Chinese characters. 
Especially, it expatiates on the connotation and foundation of Chinese 
domain name TC/SC conversion in the domain name system, it defines the 
CDN user requirements based on the culture, custom and habit of Chinese 
users, so that users around the world who use Chinese Domain Name can 
get consistent results.

Since the domain name itself is unique with certain ideographic 
functions, it is associated with intellectual property rights. 
Internationalized domain name will extend its ideographic scope into 
different languages and characters. Therefore it has an obvious mark of 
intellectual property rights. As an internationalized domain name 
protocol, how to reduce 2^n combination that user have to register 
to protect the intellectual property rights of Chinese domain name in 
deed is very important.

This article discusses the AMC-ACE-Z extension that can mostly achieve 
the TC/SC conversion of Chinese domain name (from Traditional Chinese(TC)
character to Simplified Chinese(SC) character or from SC to TC) in DNS.
This method will not affect the distribution of Unicode code point, and
will not influence other related process defined by IDNA and Nameprep. 
It only extends the AMC-ACE-Z's algorithm. On one hand the characteristic
of TC and SC are maintained, and on the other hand, TC, SC, or TC/SC 
mixed domain names should match each other when comparing in DNS. This 
method supports the consistent resolving and display of all Traditional
Chinese, all Simplified Chinese or mixed ones.

TC/SC conversion is a complex problem, but most of them are 1-1 
conversion that is content insensitive. In this draft, we mainly propose 
the solution for that. Some of the one to one conversion (1-1), which is 
confirmed by CJK folks, can be implemented by the AMC-ACE-Z Extension, 
while the rest can be solved in other solutions, which are not in the 
scope of this draft. The amount of 1-1 TC/SC characters are large (more 
than 2,000 pairs), most of which are used commonly, so they appear in the 
domain names frequently (about 83.6%, just 1-1 TC/SC, 500,000 samples). 
We hope this article could help readers to understand the necessity and 
significance of TC/SC conversion in DNS.

In appendix A, we describe the Evolutionary History of Chinese Characters 
and the Origin of Simplified Chinese Characters.

In appendix B, we analyze the existing technical solutions about TC/SC 
conversion in DNS in detail.

In appendix C, we give the 1-1 Chinese variant table.

In appendix D, we give the modified source codes based on AMC-ACE-Z.

Contents

1. What is TC/SC conversion?

The TC/SC conversion in DNS has two implications:
(1) During the whole process of DNS operation, the characteristic of TC 
and SC MUST be retained.

(2) Domain names that contain TC or SC variants MUST get the same result 
when making character string comparisons.

Based on this, to implement TC/SC conversion in DNS system means that:
(1) Preservation of original characters information (i.e. no matter if it 
is TC or SC) in ACEd label uses technical measures, such as mixed case 
annotation described in [AMC-ACE-Z], is highly recommended to recover 
original characters in application's presentation layer.
(2) All possible TC/SC variants of domain labels must be converted to 
ACEd labels which will lead to the same result while comparing in a case 
insensitive manner in DNS.

2. Base on which TC/SC is converted

2.1 Complete Set of Simplified Chinese Characters

To rectify the disorderly application state of Chinese characters, the 
Committee of National Language & Chinese Character published the Chinese 
characters simplification plan in 1956, and in 1964, A Complete Set of 
Simplified Chinese Characters was published as the standard of Chinese 
characters, and republished on June 24, 1986. This indicated the biggest 
renovation of Chinese characters during the past two thousands year. 

Over forty years' practice has proved that this simplification has 
greatly promoted the spread and the standardization of Chinese 
characters.

A Complete Set of Simplified Chinese Characters has three tables and one 
appendix. 352 simplified characters that cannot be used as a part of 
other characters are included in the first table. 132 simplified 
characters that can be a part of other characters and 14 simplified 
character components are included in the second table. 1,753 simplified 
characters that derived from the simplified characters or character 
components in the second table are included in the third table. The 
appendix contains 39 simplified characters extracted from the First 
Collection Character Variants Table published by the Ministry of Culture 
and China Chinese Characters Reform Committee in 1955.

2.2 Dictionary of Chinese Characters Variant 

Mandarin Promotion Council of Taiwan compiled Dictionary of Chinese 
Characters Variant. The version 2 was published in Aug 2001 on Web site, 
it covers all the traditional Chinese characters used in Taiwan, 
simplified Chinese characters used in mainland of China as well as 
Chinese characters used in Korea and Japan.

It has collected 106,071 characters and defined the parallel relations 
between the variant characters according to the Complete Set of 
Simplified Chinese Characters and the parallel tables of Chinese 
characters in China, Japan and Korea, and some other ancient books or 
resources.

The variant characters defined in the Dictionary of Chinese Characters 
Variant including the TC and SC. This part is refer to The Complete Set
of Simplified Chinese Characters. 

3. Implication to the end user application

The end user application can display either traditional or simplified 
Chinese font as required by the users. For example, the TC supporting 
application displays TC font as required by users by adjusting the 
original character information in the ACEd label, while the SC supporting 
application displays SC by adjusting the original character information 
in the ACEd label. If an application does not adjust the original 
character information in the ACEd label, the application will display 
the original glyphs reversed from ACEd label as default or just
display ACE label.

Once end user's application could support IDNA module, it also could 
support TC/SC variant table (about 12KB) without adding more complexity.

End user application may apply TC/SC variant transparently when ACEd 
label lose information about original character or it cannot display 
recovered character properly in accordance with the application 
requirement. So, there are four display modes: glyphs reversed from ACEd 
label by default, TC only, SC only, ACEd label.

4. Reasons and preferred place of TC/SC conversion in DNS

4.1 Reasons for TC/SC conversion in DNS

1) There are two situations where simplifications of Chinese characters 
occur: 
  (1) Due to historical development and changes, the forms of some 
  characters have been changed, for example, there is trivial difference
  in script for a same traditional Chinese character between Korea and
  Taiwan. Since Unicode assigns code points based on script, it will 
  assign them two different Unicode code points. 
  (2) In Complete Set of Simplified Chinese Characters issued by China 
  National Language Committee, traditional Chinese characters are 
  simplified by simplifying forms and character components, the 
  simplifying of forms and character components change complicated 
  characters into new simplified forms, most of them are new to ancient
  characters, therefore, these simplified characters are independence,
  and this is one of the major reasons that make the TC/SC conversion
  possible in DNS.

2) In the common part of characters in Complete Set of Simplified Chinese 
Characters and Dictionary of Chinese Character Variants, there are 3,968 
characters are TC/SC 1-1 variants, of which, 1,984 are Simplified 
characters, and 1,984 are Traditional characters, since a majority of 
them are in common use, they may appear in a domain name frequently. If 
this the possible 2^n combination problem is not solved, a number of 
variant domain names may coexist. In order to reduce the possible 2^n 
combination to protect the rights and interests of registrant, 
and to reduce the possibility of disputations sharply, this issue must be 
addressed. At the same time, the delegation problem of domains must be 
solved.

4.2 Preferred place of TC/SC conversion in DNS

The common part of characters in Complete Set of Simplified Chinese 
Characters and Dictionary of Chinese Character Variant will be placed in 
the 1-1 TC/SC parallel table as an encoding module in IDNA.

5. Requirements of Chinese domain name

5.1 User requirements
[1] TC/SC Conversion of CDN MUST be a global solution.

[2] CDN labels have three different representations:
    = Sequence of SCs
    = Sequence of TCs
    = Sequence of mixed TC/SC
In the third case, there are at least 2^n variations, where n is number 
of characters in the label which has (TC, SC) pairs.

When a user wants to register Chinese domain names, he doesn't need to 
register all the three sequences above, he can register only one of the 
sequences above, and then get the specified Chinese domain name and all 
its variants.

[3] Users of CDN may represent their domain name request also in three 
different ways and expect that it will match whatever sequence was used 
for registration. 

[4] Some applications cannot display TC (or SC) properly. In that case, 
those applications may display SC (or TC) instead, but this is not a 
mandatory feature of IDNA.

5.2 Problems concerning backward compatibility and interoperability 
[5] Case preserving: the TC/SC flag can be preserved in ACE encoding, so 
that the original form of user's representation will be maintained. That 
is the TC is not converted into SC and vice versa, in other words, the 
original code is not changed at all and CDN must preserve its original 
information (i.e. TC or SC) in display, cut & paste, DNS lookup and so 
on.

[6] In DNS, compare the TC/SC 1-1 variants as the uppercase and 
lowercase English letters, will get the the same result.

5.3 Domain data maintenance

[7] When administering delegations of DNS domains, to keep the consistent 
delegation of the TC/SC variants is necessary.

5.4 Implementation problems

[8] It is necessary to implement 1-1 TC/SC variants equivalence in 
protocol to reduce the combination of variants and inconsistent access 
problems caused by other solutions (mentioned in Appendix B).

5.5 Globalization problems

[9] Converting TC/SC in DNS MUST take considerations of the literal 
requirements of CJK people.

6. Implementation of Chinese domain name TC/SC conversion

6.1 Introduction
6.1.1 AMC-ACE-Z Review

AMC-ACE-Z (AMC-Z for abbreviation) can encode Unicode string to ASCII 
string, and decode the ASCII string to Unicode string uniquely and 
reversibly. And AMC-ACE-Z also supports Mixed-case annotation. When 
encoding Unicode code point to ASCII code point, the case of Unicode code 
point will be presented by the case of the last letter. We use this 
case-insensitivity characteristic of domain names mentioned in AMC-ACE-Z 
to support the TC/SC conversion of Chinese domain name, using Mixed-case 
annotation(and case-insensitivity characteristic of DNS) to show the 
TC/SC forms of Chinese character.

6.1.2 The Advantages of AMC-Z Extension

The method of AMC-Z Extension proposed in this article extends the AMC-Z 
algorithm, so that the AMC-Z algorithm can solve the conversion of TC/SC. 
The method has the following advantages:

1) The definition and distribution of Unicode Code Points will not be 
affected.
	
2) It only extends the AMC-ACE-Z algorithm.

3) It will correctly resolve and display most of the Chinese domain names 
in all the forms of all TC, all SC or the mixture of the both.

6.2 The Introduction of AMC-ACE-Z Extension

         Figure 1. AMC-ACE-Z Extension

Half Self Encoding means: If there are n SCs and n TCs need to be 
converted in the TC/SC 1-1 table, all together there are 2n code points 
of Chinese characters. After this conversion with an optimization 
algorithm, there are n corresponding code points selected from the 2n 
code points. 

6.2.2 AMC-Z Extension Description

In AMC-Z Extension, the 1-1 TC/SC which is confirmed by the CJK people, 
will undergo the process of Half Self Encoding with index, and the index 
will be used to differentiate TC and SC. The value obtained with the 
encoding of Half Self Encoding with index will be further encoded to ACE 
using the AMC-Z algorithm. And then the ACE string will be passed to DNS 
resolver to process.

        Figure 2: The flow of Half Self Encoding 
                  with Index Algorithm

The algorithm of Half Self Encoding with Index is as follows:
1) First, determining whether the inputted Unicode is a Han ideograph. If 
it is not, it will not be processed.
	
2) To determine whether this Unicode belongs to the scope of TC/SC 1-1. 
If it does, the code point will be processed with HSE with index. If not, 
it will not be processed.
	
3) If it will be processed with HSE with index, a conversion process will 
be carried out according to the HSE encoding conversion table. The output 
will still be some code points in same set of HSE.
	
4) The HSE processed Unicode string will be further processed by AMC-Z 
algorithm, and then ACE string will be outputted.
	
5) When decoding, the process can be reversed.

The core of Half Self Encoding with index (HSE) is TC/SC 1-1 and HSE code 
point conversion table, as showed in table 1. There are 3 columns in this 
table, that is, TC column, SC column and corresponding HSE code point 
column. The first and second columns in the table are the 1-1 TC/SC 
characters jointly confirmed by China, Japan and Korea, the HSE code 
point column is the Unicode code point generated from the encoding of 
these two TC and SC characters. Since the number of TC code points in the 
table equal to the number of SC code points, and assuming the number 
is n, the number of HSE code points will be n as well. These n numbers of 
HSE encoded code points were selected from the 2n number of code points 
with an optimization algorithm and at the same time the parameter index 
was used to differentiate the TC and SC characters (index=0 refers to TC, 
index=1 refers to SC).

  |  TC         |   SC         |  HSE code point |

  ------------------------------------------------ 

  Table 1: The Table of TC/SC & HSE code point

During the process of encoding, judgment on whether a certain character 
falls into the TC column or SC column is made through this table. If it 
does, the code point of this Chinese character will be converted into 
relating HSE code point, and the value of "Index" will be settled based 
on which column it falls into (TC column or SC column).

During the process of decoding, the search on equal value in the HSE code 
point column is carried out with the Unicode sent by AMC-Z. If there is 
an equal value, the system will determine whether to revert it to TC or 
SC according to the "Index" of the Unicode.

Because during the process of AMC-Z encoding, AMC-Z algorithm will 
determine the case of the last letter of ACE by the uppercase flags of 
the inputted Unicode code point, we can use the index generated by the 
"HSE with index" as the uppercase flags for each TC/SC. Similarly, during 
the decoding process of AMC-Z, the uppercase flags (as TC/SC index) will 
be restored.

6.3.1.2 The HSE table

The implementation process of HSE is as follows:

1) The TC/SC Pairs in the conversion table were established according to 
the 1986 Comprehensive List of Simplified Characters issued in the 
Mainland of China and the 2001 Dictionary of the Variant Form of Chinese 
characters published in Taiwan, and were approved by related Japanese and 
Korean authorities. 
	
2) With the statistics on the usage frequency of Chinese character, 
published by the Committee of National Language & Chinese Character and 
State Standards Bureau (1992), we listed the TC/SC 1-1 Pairs, which were 
joint confirmed by China, Japan and Korea, in an ascending order and 
generated the two columns of TC and SC. Altogether there are n pairs of 
TC/SC 1-1.
	
3) Based on the statistics obtained from 2), deducting the Chinese 
characters in the conversion table, there are m code points in Unicode. 
This assumes code points collection of these Frequently Used Chinese 
Characters is C={Ci, i=1...m} and the corresponding Usage Frequency 
Collection is P={Pi, i=1...m}.
		
4) There are 2n numbers of code points for the n number of TC/SC Pair in 
the conversion table. The collection of these code points is 
E={Ek,k=1...2n}. Counting the following results Wk=SUM (|Ci-Ek|*Pi), 
i=1...m, k=1...2n. SUM() means to sum up.
	
5) If Wj=Min(Wk, k=1...2n) , 1<= j <=2n , then Ej has the shortest 
distance with these m number of frequently used characters, it occupies 
the most advantageous position. Therefore, Ej will be chosen as HSE code 
point for the mostly frequently used TC/SC Pair (TC/SC in the first row 
of the conversion table). Put Ej in HSE code point column   in the first 
row.
	
6) Taking the Ej, which was selected from the last step from 
E={Ek,k=1...2n}, and put it into the collection C, put the character 
frequency of the corresponding TC/SC pair into the collection P. At this 
time, the element number in the collection E will be reduced by 1, 
i.e.2n-1. And the number of element in collection C and P will be 
increased to m+1.
	
7) As for the remaining 2n-1 elements in the collection E, counting 
Wk=SUM (|Ci-Ek|*Pi), i=1...m+1, k=1...2n-1. 

8) If Ws=Min (Wk, k=1...2n-1), 1<= s <=2n-1, then Es is the best position 
in the remaining 2n-1 number of code points, then Es will be chosen as 
the HSE code point of second frequently used TC/SC Pair.
	
9) As it goes, until all the n number of TC/SC Pairs are assigned with 
relating HSE code point.

10) Index Value: (TC, index=0), (SC, index=1).

6.3.2 Encoding Procedure:

On the Unicode string sent by Nameprep, the following procedure will be 
carried out.

1) Let output=null, take the first code point.

2) Judging if the code points is Chinese character, if it is a Chinese 
character, go to step 3), it is not, add it to the output and go to step 
4).
	
3) Take this code point, search in the TC column and SC column in the 
TC/SC 1-1 Table. If it can be found, then take the corresponding HSE code 
point value. At the time, set the index of TC/SC (0 ->TC, 1 -> SC) and 
add it to the output. If it can't be found in the TC/SC 1-1 Table, add it 
to the output and go to 4).
	
4) Take the next code point, and go to 2), until all the code points are 
processed.
	
5) Send the code point and index in the output to the AMC-Z algorithm for 
ACE encoding.

The pseudocode of encode:
let Output = output_index = null
for(i=1; i<=input_length;i++) {
	Output(i)=Input(i) 
	if(Input(i) is CJK) {
	 	if( Input(i) in conv_table) {
	 		Output(i)=HSE
	 		if (Input(i) is TC)
	 		    output_index(i) = 0
	 		else
	 		    output_index(i) = 1
	 	}
	 }
}

6.3.3 Decoding Procedure:

As for the Unicode string sent by AMC-Z, the process contrary to the 
encoding process will be carried out to decode.

1) Let output=null, take the first code point.

2) Search for code points in the HSE column of the TC/SC 1-1 Table. If it 
is found, go to 3). If it is not found, add it to output and go to 4).
	
3) In the corresponding TC/SC Pair, judge if the Chinese character is TC 
or SC, and add it to the output string.
	
4) Take the next code point, go to 2), until all the code points are 
processed.
	
The pseudocode of decoding:
let Output = null
for(i=1; i<=input_length;i++) {
	Output(i)=Input(i) 
	if(Input(i) is CJK) {
	 	if( Input(i) in HSE) {
	 		if (input_index(i) equal 0)
	 		    Output(i) = TC
	 		else
	 		    Output(i) = SC
	 	}
	 }
}

6.3.4 The Consumption of System Resource

The Consumption of System Memory: There are about 1,984 TC/SC pairs in 
the TC/SC and HSE conversion table, occupying a memory space of about 
2K*6Byte = 12Kbyte. Of course, in a specific implementation process, if 
the implementation algorithm is different, the actual consumed memory 
space would be slightly different.

If binary search is applied, the time complexity of search is O (log n). 
If Hash search is used, the time complexity is O(1) and the consumed CPU 
time would be at a low level.

6.4 The handling of the situation in case of Case Lost

If the case of the ACE string letters is changed during DNS transit and 
other relating handling, i.e. the symbols representing TC and SC are 
lost, the original TC/SC form can no longer be restored. According to the 
[IDNA], the application MAY have an option for the user to select the 
preferred method of display. This problem can be solved by the following 
measures during the decoding process:

When carrying out decoding operation with TC/SC and HSE code conversion 
table, specifying whether the user wants to display TC only, SC only or 
Default, a switch will be set and users will be allowed to set this 
switch through the applications, which will correct the display for users 
while the TC/SC can't be display. If user wants to display TC, then 
during the decoding process, all the TC/SC characters will be converted 
into TC after the table searching operation. If the user wants to display 
SC, then all the TC/SC characters will be converted into SC. If user 
doesn't set the option, the default option will be applied. The 
characters will not be converted into all TC or all SC, instead, it will 
be converted according to actual code point and index or keep ACEd label.


In order to detect whether the case of the letters in ACEd string are 
changed or not, the parity check method is applied. The tag of the ACEd 
string is used as parity check of the upper case letters in the ACEd 
string and the measures are listed as follows:

1) The ACEd string of AMC-Z consists of three parts, i.e. 
{tag}{basic_code_points-}{non_ASCII_codepoints}. The tag may be bq--, 
bQ--, Bq--, BQ-- and the letters in the basic_code_poins are all 
lowercase, since the uppercase are all mapped to lowercase in the 
Nameprep process.

2) The "bq--" tag is used if the number of the uppercase in the 
non_ASCII_codepoints is odd, that is to say, the letter "q" in the tag is 
used for the odd parity indicator of all-uppercase in the 
non_ASCII_codepoints. So the number of uppercase in the whole ACEd string 
(including tag) is odd.

3) The "bQ--" tag is used if the number of the uppercase in the 
non_ASCII_codepoints is even and the number of uppercase in the whole 
ACEd string (including tag) is odd too. 

4) If the case of the letters in ACEd string is changed during transit, 
we can assume that most of the changes are forcing letters to be all 
uppercase or all lowercase. In the all uppercase situation, all the 
letters in the ACEd string are uppercase . The tag will be changed to 
"BQ--" and the other letters are all uppercase. This situation will never 
occur if the case isn¯t modified. So we can judge that the case is 
changed. In the all-lowercase situation, all the letters in the ACEd 
string are lowercase. The tag will be changed to "bq--" and the other 
letters are all lowercase.
If all the letters in the non_ASCII_codepoints are lowercase, the tag 
must be "bQ--", because letter "q" is used as odd parity check. So we can 
also judge that the case is changed.

5) If case of letters in the ACEd string is partly changed, i.e. neither 
all uppercase nor all lowercase, the tag will also help to detect whether 
case is changed or not to some extent. If the number of uppercase becomes 
even, we can judge that the case is changed, since the letter "q" and "Q" 
in the tag is used for odd parity indicator.

6) The other two styles of tag, i.e. "Bq--" and "BQ--" are reserved for 
future extension.

6.5 Example:

For example:

TC      SC      HSE (index 1:SC,0:TC)
U+92C1  U+94DD  HSE+64ab
U+9223  U+9499  HSE+6ae7

The procedure of extended ACE encoding:

Nameprepped Unicode   AMC-Z Extension                 ACE
 {U+92C1,U+9499} -> { (HSE+64ab,0),(HSE+6ae7,1) }  -> bq--x6us2L
 {U+94DD,U+9223} -> { (HSE+64ab,1),(HSE+6ae7,0) }  -> bq--x6Us2l
 {U+94DD,U+9499} -> { (HSE+64ab,1),(HSE+6ae7,1) }  -> bQ--x6Us2L
 {U+92C1,U+9223} -> { (HSE+64ab,0),(HSE+6ae7,0) }  -> bQ--x6us2l

When comparing in DNS Server, same results can be obtained no matter 
which ACE form will be applied.

When decoding, AMC-Z will decode the ACE into Unicode code point. The 
original Unicode can be restored according to the TC and SC index by 
searching through the encoding conversion table.

7. Security considerations

The security consideration is similar to AMC-ACE-Z.

12. Appendix A - Evolutionary History of Chinese Characters and the 
Origin of Simplified Chinese Characters

12.1 Evolutionary History of Chinese Characters

Chinese characters are evolved from ideographic symbols with 6,000 to 
7,000 years of history. Chinese people have created a unique Chinese 
character system and have left a large number of letters, inscriptions 
and classics. As the language of an ancient civilization, people treasure 
its long history and artistic value and call it "fossil character".

The Chinese language is concise in pronunciation and grammar with rich 
and colorful vocabulary, but it is complicated in structure and has a 
large number of characters, making it hard to learn and memorize, and 
posing a big barrier in the proliferation of the language. LiShu, 
calligraphic style, has marked the turning point between ancient and 
modern Chinese characters; it had made extensive modifications to Chinese 
characters and was the beginning of modern Chinese characters.

Simplification is an important trait of the evolution of Chinese 
characters; oracle bone inscriptions and bronze inscriptions are the most 
ancient Chinese characters, Chinese characters has undergone three 
radical changes phases in history:
Phase one: hieroglyphic, before Shang dynasty.
Phase two: phonographic based on hieroglyphic, from oracle bone 
           inscriptions to characters in Qin dynasty.
Phase three: phonogram forming the principal part with some 
             hieroglyphic and phonographic characters reserved, from 
             Qin and Han dynasty to modern Chinese characters.

12.2 The Present Application Status of Chinese Characters

At present, people using the Chinese characters are mainly concentrated 
in Mainland of China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, Japan, Korea, Singapore, 
Vietnam, and other countries and regions where a large number of Chinese 
people live.

Since the promulgation of simplification plan of Chinese characters in 
1956, simplified Chinese has been used in Mainland of China; the plan has 
greatly promoted the spread and application of the Chinese language in 
people's daily life, meanwhile, the traditional Chinese still extensively 
exist in the social life, for its long history and artistic value.

People in Taiwan region have always used traditional Chinese characters. 
Studies and researches show that the traditional Chinese characters used 
in Taiwan has been formed in Wei and Jin dynasties.

Traditional Chinese characters used in Hong Kong and Macao is similar to 
that in Taiwan, but with their own unique characters system. After the 
reunification of Hong Kong to the Mainland of China in 1997 and Macao in 
1999, both simplified and traditional Chinese characters are used widely 
in the these two regions.

Korea and Japan mainly use traditional Chinese, while Singapore mainly 
uses simplified Chinese.


13. Appendix B - Why must do the TC/SC issues after the Nameprep?

13.1 Solution to CDN TC/SC conversion prior to IDNA - analysis

If CDN TC/SC is converted before IDNA, then the following problems may 
arise:
(1) Suppose that all applications support CDN TC/SC be implemented prior 
to IDNA, it would be a feasible solution. But in fact, the situation is 
on the contrary. There is no standardized technical solution, thus it is 
impossible for all the applications to support this solution. Further 
more the interoperability problem and the visit inconsistency problem of 
domain names will surely arise. How to ensure all applications to support 
this solution is inevitable.

(2) Since the CDN TC/SC conversion is done before IDNA, and then it must 
make sure that all domain name servers should support the consistency of 
TC/SC variant domain names. If domain name servers allow the coexistence 
of multiple TC/SC variant domain names, then only one domain name can be 
accessed by the users, while other TC/SC variant domain name will not be 
available to users, in other words, the rights and interests of the 
owners of these inaccessible domain names cannot be protected. If these 
owners' rights and interests are to be protected, then part of the 
application program must support TC/SC conversion before IDNA, and part 
of the application program must be allowed not to support the conversion 
before IDNA. Under this condition, the interoperability problems between 
applications and visit inconsistency problems are sure to arise.

(3) If multiple TC/SC variants domain names are allowed to coexist in the 
domain name server, then it will cause delegation domain problems 
predicatively.

If TC/SC domain names are not standardized, some domain name registration 
authorities allow users to register multiple TC/SC variant domain names. 
This registration policy will give rise to extensive disputation over 
domain names. At the same time, other registration authorities may forbid 
users to register multiple domain names, consistency problems are 
inevitable.

13.2 Adopting multiple records solution - analysis

If a multiple records solution are adopted, and all possible TC/SC forms 
of a single Chinese domain name are added into a zone file as the 
different forms of one identical domain name, then this approach has the 
following weakness:

(1) 2^n problem. To ensure a Chinese domain name both TC/SC to be 
correctly resolved, 2^n records must be registered and all the records 
point to one IP address (Note: n indicates the total number of the TC/SC 
variants of the domain name). Chinese has over 4,000 variants, and most 
of them are in common use, a single ordinary domain name may have dozens 
of, hundreds of even thousands of TC/SC records, if all of them are to be 
registered, then total number of registrations will explode. In order to 
protect their domain name, users must register 2^n domain names, 
registration cost will increase rapidly, and this is obviously not 
practical.

(2) The lower level delegation domain name servers may adopt a different 
domain administrative policy or they simply don't support multiple 
records registration, therefore the consistency of TC/SC domain names 
cannot be ensured.

(3) How to ensure that the 2^n records are to be owned by a single 
registered user? This is also an inevitable question, if this cannot be 
ensured, there are will be a large number of domain name disputations. 
Different registration authorities has different registration policies, 
even if the registration policies can prevent gTLD and ccTLD practice; 
they don't have control over secondary or tertiary domain.

13.3 Adopting TC only records and SC only records solution - analysis

TC only records and SC only records solution has the following weakness:
(1) Not applicable to Hong Kong and Macao where both TC and SC are used, 
simplified Chinese is not used at all in Taiwan, TC only or SC only 
records cannot meet the requirements of the users.

(2) This approach cannot solve technical delegation domain problems 
either.

(3) How to ensure that the two kinds of records are to be owned by a 
single registrant? This is also an inevitable question, if this cannot be 
ensured, there are will be a large number of domain name disputes. 
Different registration authorities have different registration policies. 
Even if the registration policies can prevent gTLD and ccTLD practice, 
they don't have control over secondary or tertiary domain.

Besides these two records, how to regulate the large amount of variant 
records through registration policies is still a problem to be solved.

13.4 Adding a TC/SC parallel table in the domain name server - analysis

Adding a TC/SC parallel table in the domain name server is the same as 
setting up an equivalent mapping table on the part of a DNS server for 
TC/SC conversion, this method has the following shortcomings:
(1) Modifications are needed on the DNS server to add an equivalent 
mapping table.

(2) Technically, the upgraded DNS server may have compatibility problems 
with a DNS server that has not been upgraded. Compatibility problems may 
bring cache problems to the DNS server and cause the inconsistency of 
visits.

13.5 TC/SC domain name conversion via changing the comparison algorithm 
and loading algorithm of the domain name server - analysis

Converting the TC/SC domain names by changing the comparison algorithm 
and loading algorithm of the DNS server has two major drawbacks: 

(1) Modifications are needed on the DNS server to change its comparison 
algorithm and loading algorithm.

(2) Technically, the upgraded DNS server may have compatibility problems 
with a DNS server that has not been upgraded. Compatibility problems may 
bring cache problems to the DNS server and cause the inconsistency of 
visits.

13.6 TC/SC domain name conversion in Nameprep - analysis

The TC/SC domain name conversion in Nameprep will make one type of 
characters disappeared, either TC or SC. In Unicode character set, since 
TC and SC has different structural forms and will have different code 
points, and the Unicode cannot treat the different code points as one 
equivalent code point, therefore it does not suitable for TC/SC 
conversion. TC/SC conversion demands that both TC and SC reserves their 
identity and they're equivalent when making domain name comparisons. 

To sum up, the TC/SC conversion can only be done between Nameprep and 
AMC-ACE-Z. The AMC-ACE-Z extension encoding method we presented doesn't 
make any changes on Unicode, Nameprep and AMC-ACE-Z. It supports TC only, 
SC only or TC and SC mixed together. It also enables the user inputs to 
convert back to their original forms.

Users require that CDN supports all TC, all SC or mixed, and the 
corresponding 1-1 TS/SC variant characters can get a unique comparison 
result throughout the world. Only by defining and processing in 
accordance with the existing protocol standards can the CDN requirement 
of worldwide users be met.
