Abstract


   This document provides an Applicability Statement for Securemail, a
   framework proposal for secure transmission and better authentication
   of email based on current Internet standards.  The SecureMail
   framework proposes the use of Transaction Layer Security (TLS), the
   Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and Sender ID to support secure email
   communication between internet servers with some assurance of the
   authenticity of the message sender.

1.  Introduction


   This document provides an Applicability Statement for Securemail, a
   pragmatic framework to increase email security based on current
   internet standards.  SecureMail secures the transport of email in a
   way analagous to the postal system and paper mail.

   The SecureMail framework is being proposed as a replacement for the
   New Zealand Government's existing proprietary secure email system,
   SEEMail.  It is expected to provide a useful framework for secure
   transmission of email generally and makes use of common technologies
   to achieve a greater degree of transmission security and
   authentication than standard internet email.



1.1.  Terminology


   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].



2.  Background


   The New Zealand government has been using secure email since 1999.

   An initial pilot used secure email clients with individual users
   being issued Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) digital certificates on
   smart cards.  This worked, but had a number of issues:

   - Content: All content was encrypted to individuals; therefore
   agencies were unable to enforce inappropriate content policies

   - Accessibility: Vendors could not guarantee a continued long-term
   technical ability to decrypt material; therefore agencies were unable
   to maintain the material in encrypted form for long-term access

   - Client software variability: The four trial agencies between them
   had 7 different email clients; therefore users found email clients
   behaved differently, creating user support issues

   - Inconvenience: Users found it inconvenient to unlock the smartcard



Pearson, Hendrikx & Hunt                            Section 2.  [Page 4]

   with a PIN after a 30 second timeout.

   The project then successfully piloted server-to-server PKI-based
   secure email, with each server being issued a domain-based digital
   certificate and securing all messages to other participating servers.

   This infrastructure, called SEEMail, is currently used by more than
   60 government agencies to securely exchange email (and attachments)
   over the Internet.  However, the agencies have some issues with the
   infrastructure:

   - Cost: Commercial secure email software is licensed on a per mailbox
   basis, making it prohibitively expensive for larger agencies, wanting
   to use commercial software, where not all staff need secure email.
   In addition, the software often has management intensive processes
   associated with setting up secure accounts.

   - Experience: Running a PKI application is technically challenging.
   As staff change, there is a loss of experience associated with PKI
   implementation and maintenance.

   - Robustness: When a PKI-based secure email system goes wrong, it can
   disrupt communication.  For instance, whenever the Certificate
   Revocation List (CRL) is unavailable, email applications may halt
   email delivery until the information is available again - and yet,
   email is about speedy delivery.  In addition, the behaviour of email
   applications in the event of conditions such as certificate expiry is
   not always well understood.  Very few commercial certificate
   authorities offer a service to generate broken, corrupt, or expired
   certificates, to test the behaviour of vendor products.



3.  Motivation


   Government agencies and other organisations want to be able to
   communicate securely with their customers using an email system that
   is equivalent, in terms of security, to postal mail.

   In the ideal situation - where government customers' ISPs supported
   SEEmail - the government agencies would utilise the existing SEEMail
   infrastructure to conduct secure communications with their customers.

   However, the ISPs providing email infrastructure for agency clients
   are concerned with:

   - Cost: Who will pay for the software?



Pearson, Hendrikx & Hunt                            Section 3.  [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT           Expires: December 2007                June 2007


   - Experience: Who will implement and maintain it?

   - Robustness: Will it cause problems and will it scale?

   Clearly, SEEMail is not going to be easily scalable to the Internet
   as a whole.



4.  SecureMail


   The NZ Government's experience with server-to-server secure email is
   that it can work exceedingly well.  SecureMail is an application of
   existing standards to achieve secure email without the limitations of
   SEEMail.

   It uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) for confidentiality and
   integrity of the message and Sender ID [RFC4406] and the Sender
   Policy Framework (SPF) [RFC4408] to authenticate the sender.

   It is intended to secure IN-CONFIDENCE email communications between
   government, business and citizens.



4.1.  Confidentiality - TLS


   SecureMail uses TLS to create an encrypted connection that plaintext
   messages are passed through.  SecureMail connections are negotiated
   server-to-server using anonymous key exchange.  The connections are
   set up as required using anonymous Diffie-Hellman key exchange,
   rather than through a pre-arranged agreement or approval list.



4.1.1.  Why TLS?


   TLS is a gateway based model, operating between SMTP servers.

   - Cost: There are no significant capital costs.  TLS is available
   with most email systems

   - Experience: It is already active (slightly more than 10% of 4000
   New Zealand domains tested already had TLS enabled on their SMTP
   servers)

INTERNET-DRAFT           Expires: December 2007                June 2007


   - Robustness: TLS is a mature standard and operates transparently to
   secure transport protocols



4.1.2.  Why Anonymous Key Exchange?


   This removes the need for any centralised Public Key Infrastructure,
   and resolves several of the issues discovered using SEEMail.



4.2.  Authentication - SPF And Sender ID


   The SecureMail framework uses two sender authentication standards:
   SPF and Sender ID.

   SPF operates at the session layer rather than on the email's content.
   The advantage of this is that it can validate the address before the
   message is accepted for delivery by the receiving server.  However,
   this also means that the "From:" address that the recipient user sees
   is not necessarily that which was authenticated.

   SenderID mitigates this risk as, in its PRA mode, it checks the
   sender information contained in the content of the email message
   against the published information for the domain.



5.  Implementation Standards For All Mail Servers



   For sending:

   - Mail server domain MUST have an SPF record so that the server can
   be authenticated as an approved sender of the message

   - Mail server SHOULD try to send messages securely using a TLS
   connection

   For receiving:

   - Servers with "securemail" as the left-most part of their hostname
   name SHALL only accept email if a TLS connection is established




Pearson, Hendrikx & Hunt                            Section 5.  [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT           Expires: December 2007                June 2007


   - Other servers, SHOULD attempt to accept messages securely via a TLS
   connection, but otherwise allow an insecure connection

   - Server SHALL enforce the mail sending policy specified by a sending
   domain's SPF record (if any)

   - Server SHALL enforce the mail sending policy specified by a sending
   domain's Sender ID record (if any)



6.  Implementation Standards For SecureMail Servers

6.1.  Discovery mechanisms


   Given that a SecureMail server will only ever receive email securely,
   it cannot be considered a genuine MTA (according to [RFC3207]).  This
   RFC clearly states that publicly-referenced MTAs must not require TLS
   connections.

   A SecureMail server cannot therefore be listed in the MX records for
   a domain.  Instead, we propose a standard naming convention for
   servers that implement the SecureMail framework.

   For receiving:

   - SecureMail servers have a standard naming convention, with
   "securemail" as the leftmost part of the domain name, for example,
   securemail.example.com

   - SecureMail servers MUST refuse to accept email from senders under
   any of the following conditions:

     - the sender's SPF record
       does not exist; or
       does not prohibit all other senders "-all"; or
       upon evaluation, returns any result other than "Pass"

     - the sender's Sender ID record
       does not exist; or
       does not prohibit all other senders "-all"; or
       upon evaluation, returns any result other than "Pass"

     - the sender's TLS connection
       does not exist; or
       does not meet the minimum cryptography standards




Pearson, Hendrikx & Hunt                          Section 6.1.  [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT           Expires: December 2007                June 2007


   For sending

   - SecureMail servers MUST have a valid Sender ID record specifying
   valid senders and prohibiting all other senders ("-all"), so that the
   message envelope and sender information in the content can be
   authenticated.

   - SecureMail servers MUST refuse to send email (and return it to the
   sender) under any of the following conditions:

     - the receiver's TLS connection does not exist

     - the receiver's TLS connection does not meet the minimum
   cryptography standards.



6.2.  Cryptography Standard


   The minimum cryptography standards are defined by the commonly
   available implementations of TLS.  SecureMail servers MUST support
   Diffie-Helman key exchange, 256-bit AES encryption and SHA1 message
   digest.  In future these requirements are expected to require ECDSA
   key exchange and SHA-256 message digest.

   Server crypto modules SHOULD be evaluated to FIPS140-2 and SHOULD be
   combined with a Common Criteria evaluation of the product to EAL3, or
   higher, by the Australasian Information Security Evaluation Programme
   (AISEP), or equivalent.

7.  Security Considerations

7.1.  TLS


   Although TLS is provided as a library (e.g., OpenSSL), the MTA still
   needs to be able to use it correctly.  Administrators need to ensure
   they use an implementation that has been tested.



7.2.  Man In The Middle


   Before the TLS session is established, the SecureMail approach is
   vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.  The MITM sets up
   secure TLS sessions with the sending and receiving servers, who
   believe they are communicating with each other.  Both links could
   appear to be fully authenticated if the DNS records are modified or
   if the attacker can force packets between the two servers' IP
   addresses to pass through the attacker's device (alternatively, the
   attacker might not bother setting up the attacker to recipient link).

   DNSSEC [RFC4033] or the use of mutually authenticated TLS (instead of
   anonymous TLS) would mitigate the risk.  It would require PKI
   certificates for each mail server but, unlike S/MIME, the
   certificates would not need to be pre-positioned as they can be
   passed in the handshaking phase.  A directory would still be
   required, but only to publish CRLs (Certificate Revocation Lists).

   In situations requiring higher levels of assurance, it is recommended
   that PKI certificates be exchanged between the two parties.



7.3.  DNS Attack


   If the sending domain's DNS record is compromised and the SPF record
   is modified to include an attacker's address, that device would
   appear to be authorised to send mail on the domain's behalf.  This
   type of attack is unlikely as the types of threat agents (spammers,
   phishers, etc.) are unlikely to want the additional effort and risk
   of modifying DNS servers to pretend to originate from a SecureMail
   address.  As with the example above, the vulnerability could be
   minimised by the use of mutually authenticated TLS (i.e., the
   attacker would also have to get a legitimate key pair and
   certificate, and the attack would be traceable through that

   certificate).



8.  Other Considerations


   SecureMail is intended to provide better security during transmission
   for email sent over the Internet between two mail servers.  It is not
   intended to specify how the sender or receiver manages their own
   email security.



8.1.  Store And Forward


   Organisations that use an intermediate mail server between the
   sending and recipient servers (e.g., store and forwarded through an
   ISP or an application-level firewall) can break security.  The
   configuration to make this work could make the SPF look-up process
   ineffectual and the mail may be transmitted in plaintext at this
   point.



8.2.  Mixing Secure And Insecure Receiving


   It is recommended that received SecureMail messages be kept separate
   from other messages.  Otherwise it will be difficult to determine
   whether the message was authenticated (via SecureMail), or arrived
   unauthenticated via the normal mail system.

   The method proposed to mitigate this risk is to have alternative
   accounts or inboxes for SecureMail versus other mail.  Based on the
   "To:" address and the mailbox a message is in, the user knows whether
   the sender has been validated.

   Alternatively or additionally, the receiving mail server could mark
   incoming messages with their authentication level in a similar way to
   junk mail marking employed in some systems (the normal mail system
   would have to check/remove similar markings in email that arrived
   through 'normal' channels).

INTERNET-DRAFT           Expires: December 2007                June 2007


8.3.  Mixing Secure And Insecure Sending


   When a user sends a message securely, they have no control or
   knowledge of how the message will be delivered.  Their own system may
   not be configured to correctly secure the message.

   A user can assume that a SecureMail server, identified by
   "securemail" as the leftmost part of the hostname, will fail-safe and
   refuse to accept insecure messages sent from the user's domain.

   The user can test this, using the free testing tool service at
   http://tools.secmx.org/.



9.  Email Distribution


   Users who access a SecureMail server should connect to the server
   using a secure connection (e.g., using POP3/SSL or a secure internal
   network).  Remote users should only connect to such a mail server
   utilising equipment which has been appropriately certified and
   accredited for that purpose.



10.  Timekeeping Requirements


   SecureMail servers should maintain time synchronisation using Network
   Time Protocol (NTP).



11.  Future Development


   In the future, thought will be given to improving the security,
   through public key technology or other technologies not involving
   digital certificates, such as Kerberos.



12.  IANA Considerations


   This document has no actions for IANA.
