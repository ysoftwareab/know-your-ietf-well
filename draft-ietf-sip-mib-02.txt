1. Introduction 
    
   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) 
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. 
   In particular, it describes a set of managed objects that are used 
   to schedule management operations periodically or at specified dates 
   and times. 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [16].  
    
    
2. The SNMP Management Framework 
    
   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major 
   components: 
    
   . An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [1]. 
 
   . Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the 
     purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of 
     Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in 
     STD16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The 
     second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 
     [5], RFC 2579 [6] and RFC 2580 [7]. 
 
   . Message protocols for transferring management information.  The 
     first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and

   Internet-Draft              SIP MIB                  February 2001 
    
     described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message 
     protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is 
     called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10]. 
     The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and 
     described in RFC 2272 [11] and RFC 2274 [12]. 
 
   . Protocol operations for accessing management information. The 
     first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is 
     described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol 
     operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 
     [13]. 
 
. A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [14] and the 
  view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2275 [15]. 
      
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are 
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.  
    
   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A 
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate 
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically 
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no 
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine-readable 
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in 
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine-
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of 
   the MIB. 
    
    
3. Overview 
    
   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [17] is an application-layer 
   control protocol that can establish, modify and terminate multimedia 
   sessions or calls. This MIB provides some managed objects for SIP 
   entities defined in RFC 2543 - User Agent, Proxy server, Redirect 
   server and Registrar. It is provided as a base for the work within 
   the working group to define a MIB. 
    
   This MIB is intended to provide management of the basic SIP 
   entities. It provides for monitoring of status and protocol 
   statistics, as well as for configuration of SIP entities. It also 
   includes objects for the SIP INFO method [20]. 
    
    
4. Structure of SIP MIB 
 
   This memo specifies five MIB modules.  They are SIP-MIB-SMI, SIP-
   COMMON-MIB, SIP-SERVER-MIB, SIP-UA-MIB and SIP-TC. SIP-MIB-SMI 
   indicates the root OID of SIP MIB modules.  SIP-COMMON-MIB contains 
   common objects used in all the SIP entities such as Registrars, 
   Proxy Servers, Redirect Servers and User Agents. SIP-SERVER-MIB and 
   SIP-UA-MIB includes objects defined for Registrars, Proxy Redirect 
     
   Lingle/Maeng/Mule/Walker                                          3 

   Internet-Draft              SIP MIB                  February 2001 
    
   servers and User Agents, respectively.  SIP-TC defines the textual 
   conventions used throughout MIB modules.  
    
   Each MIB Module contains following groups of objects: 
 
   -- SIP-COMMON-MIB: Common to all the SIP entities 
      sipCommonConfigGroup,  
      sipCommonStatsGroup,  
      sipCommonConfigTimerGroup, 
      sipCommonConfigTimerExtMethodGroup, 
      sipCommonConfigRetryGroup, 
      sipCommonConfigRetryExtMethodGroup, 
      sipCommonStatsRetryGroup, 
      sipCommonStatsRetryExtMethodsGroup, 
      sipCommonNotifGroup, 
      sipCommonStatusCodeNotifGroup. 
    
   -- SIP-SERVER-MIB: Groups of objects for Registrars, Proxy and 
   -- Redirect Servers 
      sipServerConfigGroup, 
      sipProxyConfigGroup, 
      sipProxyStatsGroup 
      sipServerConfigGroup, 
      sipRegistrarConfigGroup, 
      sipRegistrarStatsGroup, 
 
   -- SIP-UA-MIB: Groups of objects for User Agents 
      sipUAConfigGroup 
        
    
   It is required to implement SIP-COMMON-MIB together with its own MIB 
   module in Registrars, Proxy Servers, Redirect Servers and User 
   Agents.  For instance, a SIP Registrar will need four MIB modules, 
   SIP-MIB-SMI, SIP-COMMON-MIB, SIP-SERVER-MIB, and SIP-TC in order to 
   provide a complete set of objects. If a device has more than one sip 
   entity or multiple instances of the same entity, it should implement 
   multiple SIP modules.  Section 4.2 describes handling of multiple 
   instances in detail.    
    
    
4.1. Textual Conventions 
    
   The data type SipTransportProtocol is used as textual conventions in 
   this document.  These textual conventions have NO effect on either 
   the syntax or the semantics of any managed object.  Objects defined 
   using these conventions are always encoded by means of the rules 
   that define their primitive type.  Hence, no changes to the SMI or 
   the SNMP are necessary to accommodate these textual conventions, 
   which are adopted merely for the convenience of readers.

4.2. Relationship to Other MIB 
    
   There is a requirement to be able to support multiple instances of 
   SIP MIB modules in the context of a single system having a single 
   SNMP agent.       
   It is also possible to have multiple instances of a particular type 
   of SIP entity running on the same system.  For example, there may be 
   Registrars for different domains with completely different 
   behaviors. 
    
   While there are separate MIB modules defined for SIP User Agents and 
   SIP servers, there is also a "common" MIB module expected to be 
   supported by every SIP entity.  Further, all SIP entities are either 
   acting as a UAC, UAS or perhaps both.  So a SIP Proxy Server must 
   support the SIP-SERVER-MIB and SIP-COMMON-MIB modules.  Likewise, 
   the Registrar must support the SIP-SERVER-MIB and SIP-COMMON-MIB 
   modules.  Here we have the requirement for supporting multiple 
   instances of a particular MIB module in one system. 
    
   This requirement is solved by using the framework provided by the 
   NETWORK-SERVICES-MIB, RFC 2788 [19]. A device implementing the SIP 
   MIB MUST support the NETWORK-SERVICES-MIB and, at a minimum, it MUST 
   support the applIndex and applName objects in applTable.  The 
   following applName conventions will be adopted: 
    
       o for a SIP Proxy entity, applName must be equal to "sip_proxy" 
       o for a SIP Redirect entity, applName must be equal to 
         "sip_redirect" 
       o for a SIP Registrar entity, applName must be equal to
         "sip_registrar" 
       o for a SIP User Agent entity, applName must be equal to 
         "sip_ua" 
       o for a SIP entity acting in any combination of Proxy, Redirect, 
         or Registrar, AND wishing to support only a single instance of 
         the SIP-COMMON-MIB, the applName for the combined server 
         entity must reflect the appropriate combination. For example, 
         "sip_proxy_redirect" or "sip_proxy_registrar". 
    
   Additionally, the following objects may be supported in applTable.  
   If they are, the object values SHOULD be populated as follows: 
    
       o applVersion: version of the SIP application;  if the SIP 
         protocol version is used, the value MUST be as defined in SIP 
         [17], section 4.3.1. 
       o applUptime: value must be identical to sipServiceStartTime 
         defined in the SIP-COMMON module, 
       o applOperStatus: value should reflect the operational status 
         defined in sipServiceOperStatus, at least by means of a 
         mapping, 
       o applLastChange: value must be identical to 
         sipServiceLastChange defined in the SIP-COMMON module.

   Note: There are a number of other objects in the applTable.  They 
   are not included for the sake of brevity and for the fact that they 
   do not enhance the concept being presented. 
    
    
   Example 1: The table below illustrates how it would conceptually 
   appear in a system acting as both, a Proxy and Registrar server and 
   wishing to maintain separate SIP-COMMON-MIB instances. 
    
   The NETWORK-SERVICES-MIB applTable would be populated as follows: 
    
      applIndex | applName        | applDescription 
      ----------+-----------------+------------------------------ 
          1     | "sip_proxy"     | "ACME SIP Proxy" 
      ----------+-----------------+------------------------------ 
          2     | "sip_registrar" | "ACME SIP Registrar" 
      ----------+-----------------+------------------------------ 
    
    
   The SIP-COMMON-MIB sipCommonCfgTable would have two rows: one for 
   the proxy (applIndex=1) and one for the registrar (applIndex=2).  
   The SIP-SERVER-MIB tables would, however, only be populated with one 
   row  indexed by applIndex=1 and applIndex=2 respectively if the 
   server provides either proxy or registrar. 
    
   SIP-COMMON-MIB sipCommonCfgTable might be populated as: 
    
      applIndex | sipProtocolVersion | sipServiceOperStatus | ... 
      ----------+--------------------+----------------------+---- 
          1     |     "SIP/2.0"      |      up(1)           | 
      ----------+--------------------+----------------------+---- 
          2     |     "SIP/2.0"      |      restarting(6)   | 
      ----------+--------------------+----------------------+---- 
    
   while sipProxyCfgTable in SIP-SERVER-MIB is populated as: 
    
      applIndex | sipRequestMaxExpires | sipProxyStateful | ... 
      ----------+----------------------+------------------+---- 
          1     |        3600          |      false       | 
      ----------+----------------------+------------------+---- 
    
   and sipRegUserTable in SIP-SERVER-MIB is populated as: 
    
      applIndex | sipUserIndex |   sipUserUri             | ... 
      ----------+--------------+--------------------------+----

   Example 2: The next table illustrates how it would conceptually 
   appear in a system acting as both, a Proxy and Registrar server and 
   wishing to share a single instance of SIP-COMMON-MIB. 
        
   The NETWORK-SERVICES-MIB applTable would be populated as follows:  
        
         applIndex | applName             | applDescription  
         ----------+----------------------+--------------------------- 
             1     | "sip_proxy_registrar"| "ACME SIP Proxy&Registrar"  
         ----------+----------------------+--------------------------- 
       
   The SIP-COMMON-MIB sipCommonCfgTable would have only one row to 
   cover both the proxy and the registrar. 
        
      SIP-COMMON-MIB sipCommonCfgTable might be populated as:  
        
         applIndex | sipProtocolVersion | sipServiceOperStatus | ...  
         ----------+--------------------+----------------------+----  
             1     |     "SIP/2.0"      |      up(1)           |  
         ----------+--------------------+----------------------+----  
        
      while sipProxyCfgTable in SIP-SERVER-MIB is populated as:  
        
         applIndex | sipRequestMaxExpires | sipProxyStateful | ...  
         ----------+----------------------+------------------+----  
             1     |        3600          |      false       |

      and sipRegUserTable in SIP-SERVER-MIB is populated as:

   Internet-Draft              SIP MIB                  February 2001 
    
                 may be common to all SIP entities.  
                   
                 SIP is an application-layer signalling protocol for   
                 creating, modifying and terminating multimedia   
                 sessions with one or more participants. These sessions  
                 include Internet multimedia conferences and Internet   
                 telephone calls.  SIP is defined in RFC 2543 (March   
                 1999).  
     
                 This MIB is defined for the managing objects which are  
                 common to SIP User Agents (UAs), Proxy and Redirect   
                 Servers, and Registrars.  Objects specific to each of  
                 these entities may be managed using entity specific  
                 MIBs defined in other modules.  
     
                 A User Agent is an application that contains both a  
                 User Agent Client (UAC) and a User Agent Server (UAS).  
                 A UAC is an application that initiates a SIP request.  
                 A UAS is an application that contacts the user when a  
                 SIP request is received and that returns a response on  
                 behalf of the user.  The response accepts, rejects, or  
                 redirects the request.  
     
                 A Proxy Server acts as both a client and a server.  
                 It accepts requests from other clients, either  
                 responding to them or passing them on to other  
                 servers, possibly after modification.  
     
                 A Redirect Server accepts requests from clients and  
                 returns zero or more addresses to that client. Unlike  
                 a Proxy server it does not initiate requests.  Unlike  
                 a User Agent Server it does not accept calls.  
     
                 A Registrar is a server that accepts REGISTER  
                 requests.  A Registrar is typically co-located with a  
                 Proxy or Redirect Server."

                 SIP is an application-layer signalling protocol for   
                 creating, modifying and terminating multimedia   
                 sessions with one or more participants. These sessions  
                 include Internet multimedia conferences and Internet   
                 telephone calls.  SIP is defined in RFC 2543 (March   
                 1999).  
                   
                 A User Agent is an application that contains both a  
                 User Agent Client (UAC) and a User Agent Server (UAS).  
                 A UAC is an application that initiates a SIP request.  
                 A UAS is an application that contacts the user when a  
                 SIP request is received and that returns a response on  
                 behalf of the user.  The response accepts, rejects, or  
                 redirects the request."

        DESCRIPTION  
                "Initial version of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)  
                 Server MIB module.  
     
                 SIP is an application-layer signalling protocol for   
                 creating, modifying and terminating multimedia   
                 sessions with one or more participants. These sessions  
                 include Internet multimedia conferences and Internet   
                 telephone calls.  SIP is defined in RFC 2543 (March   
                 1999).  
     
                 This MIB is defined for the management of SIP Proxy,   
                 Redirect, and Registrar Servers.  
     
                 A Proxy Server acts as both a client and a server.  
                 It accepts requests from other clients, either  
                 responding to them or passing them on to other  
                 servers, possibly after modification.  
     
                 A Redirect Server accepts requests from clients and  
                 returns zero or more addresses to that client. Unlike  
                 a Proxy server it does not initiate requests.  Unlike

6. Security Considerations 
    
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that 
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such 
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
   environments. The support for SET operations in a non-secure

   Internet-Draft              SIP MIB                  February 2001 
    
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
   network operations. 
    
   The managed objects in this MIB contain sensitive information since, 
   collectively, they allow tracing and influencing of connections in 
   SIP entities and provide information of their connection 
   characteristics. 
    
   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and 
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending 
   them over the network via SNMP. Not all versions of SNMP provide 
   features for such a secure environment. 
    
   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the network 
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is 
   no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and 
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB. 
    
   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security 
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically, the use 
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [18] and the View-based 
   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [19] is recommended. 
    
   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP 
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly 
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals 
   users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them. 
 
7. Intellectual Property
