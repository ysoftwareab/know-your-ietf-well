 Abstract 
  
    This document addresses Fast Handover over HMIPv6 networks. A simple 
    integration of FMIPv6 with HMIPv6 may induce unnecessary processing 
    overhead for re-tunneling at the previous Access Router and 
    inefficient usage of network bandwidth. This document describes the 
    Fast Handover for HMIPv6 (F-HMIPv6), which is designed to be friendly 
    with the data transport feature of HMIPv6. In F-HMIPv6, the Mobile 
    Nodes inform the MAP about its movement anticipation and thus the bi-
    directional tunnels for fast handover are established between MAP and 
    NAR, not between PAR and NAR. The F-HMIPv6 scheme utilizes the 
    existing FMIPv6 messages, without defining any new control messages.

 1. Introduction 
     
    The overall handover latency in Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) is dependent on 
    the various delay factors such as movement detection, IP address 
    configuration, and location (or binding) update. The Hierarchical 
    MIPv6 (HMIPv6) facilitates to reduce the delay concerned with the 
    location update, in which an MN sends a local Binding Updates (BU) to 
    the local MAP, rather than the Home Agent and Correspondent Nodes 
    that are typically further away. On the other hand, the Fast Handover 
    for MIPv6 (FMIPv6) uses L2 signals for earlier movement detection and 
    configuration of a new CoA for the new access router in advance, so 
    as to minimize the disruption of services during handover. For these 
    purposes, the FMIPv6 defines a set of various messages and also 
    establishes bi-directional tunnels between Access Routers concerned. 
     
    This document addresses Fast Handover over HMIPv6 networks. It may be 
    straightforward to simply integrate the FMIPv6 scheme with HMIPv6. 
    However, such simple integration may induce unnecessary processing 
    overhead for re-tunneling at the previous Access Routers and also 
    inefficient usage of network bandwidth. The main reason for this is 
    that the data transport of HMIPv6 is based on the tunneling from the 
    MAP to MNs (i.e., ARs are not involved here), while the FMIPv6 uses 
    the tunneling between the previous and new Access Routers for fast 
    handover.  
     
    This document describes the Fast Handover scheme for HMIPv6 (F-
    HMIPv6). In F-HMIPv6, the bi-directional tunnels for fast handover 
    are established between MAP and NAR, not between PAR and NAR. The F-
    HMIPv6 is friendly with the data transport feature of HMIPv6 and 
    utilizes the well-defined FMIPv6 messages, without defining any new 
    messages.  
  
  
 2. Terminology 
  
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
    document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2]. 
     
    This document uses all the terminology described in the MIPv6 [3], 
    HMIPv6 [4], and FMIPv6 [5] documents. In addition, this document uses 
    the following terms for the on-link Care of Address (LCoA): 
     
    PLCoA: MN's LCoA valid on the Previous Access Router (PAR). It 
          corresponds to the PCoA of the FMIPv6. 
     
    NLCoA: MN's LCoA valid on the New Access Router (NAR). It corresponds 
          to the NCoA of the FMIPv6.

 3. Motivations 
  
    Figure 1 illustrates a reference configuration for fast handover in 
    HMIPv6 networks. In the figure, the MAP acts as an aggregation router 
    in the hierarchical domain. In the domain, a mobile node (MN) moves 
    from the previous AR (PAR) region into the new AR (NAR) region, and 
    the corresponding LCoA will change from PLCoA to NLCoA.

    A natural choice for fast handover in HMIPv6 networks may be to apply 
    the existing FMIPv6 scheme over the HMIPv6 networks. In this case, a 
    bi-directional tunnel will be established between PAR and NAR by the 
    FMIPv6 procedures. 
     
    However, it is noted that such simple integration of FMIPv6 with 
    HMIPv6 may possibly induce additional processing overhead for re-
    tunneling at PAR and also inefficient usage of network bandwidth.

    Figure 2 shows the data flow by the simple integration of FMIPv6 with 
    HMIPv6. According to the HMIPv6 operations, the data packets sent by 
    CN will arrive at MAP and then be tunneled to MN over PLCoA.

      Figure 2: Data flows by simple integration of FMIPv6 with HMIPv6  
     
     
    When the handover is initiated, a bi-directional tunnel will be 
    established between PAR and NAR according to the FMIPv6 procedures. 
    To forward the data packets to the NAR by using the tunnel, the PAR 
    must first intercept those data packets flowing from the MAP, and 
    then perform the re-tunneling process. This may be done by adding a 
    new outer IP header of <Source = PAR, Destination = NAR> to the data 
    packets sent by MAP according to the HMIPv6 operations.  
     
    In the viewpoint of the HMIPv6 operations, the above approach has the 
    following disadvantages: 
     
    (1) The PAR must perform the tunneling operations for fast handover, 
       in addition to the HMIPv6 tunneling from MAP to MN. To do this, 
       the PAR must first intercept the data packets flowing from the 
       MAP, which will be an additional overhead for HMIPv6. It is noted 
       that the data delivery in HMIPv6 is performed based on MAP. 
     
    (2) In HMIPv6, the actual data path of the bi-directional tunnel 
       between PAR and NAR may include the MAP (i.e., PAR û MAP û NAR). 
       Accordingly, the data packets will flow twice along the path 
       between PAR and MAP. This induces inefficiency of network 
       bandwidth usage.  
     
    (3) From such detouring feature, the overall handover latency may 
       possibly increase during the handover period.

    From the observations described above, it is clear that the fast 
    handover for HMIPv6 needs to be designed by considering the data 
    transport features of the HMIPv6 (i.e., in HMIPv6, all data packets 
    are intercepted by MAP and delivered over the tunnel between MAP and 
    MNs). 
     
    This document describes the scheme of Fast Handover for HMIPv6 (F-
    HMIPv6), in which the MAP performs the tunneling for fast handover 
    instead of the PAR. By the F-HMIPv6 scheme, the data packets sent by 
    CN will be tunneled by the MAP toward the NAR during the handover. 
     
    Figure 3 illustrates the data flows by the F-HMIPv6.

                    Figure 3: Data flows by F-HMIPv6  
     
  
    Before handover, according to the HMIPv6 operations, the data packets 
    sent by CN are tunneled by MAP to MN with the following IP fields: 
     
    - Inner IP header: <Source = CN, Destination = RCoA of MN> 
    - Outer IP header: <Source = MAP, Destination = PLCoA of MN> 
     
    When the F-HMIPv6 handover is triggered (e.g., by receiving the FBU 
    message from the MN), the MAP will establish a bi-directional tunnel 
    with the NAR, and then begin to forward the data packets to the NAR 
    over the tunnel. By the tunnel, each data packet has an additional 
    outer IP header to the normal HMIPv6 headers with the following IP 
    fields: 
     
    - Additional outer IP header: <S = MAP, Destination = NAR> 
     
    When receiving the tunneled data packets from the MAP, the NAR will 
    de-capsulate them and then be caching the de-capsulated data packets. 
    When the MN moves into the NAR region, the NAR will deliver the 
    cached data packets to the MN, as done in FMIPv6.

 4. F-HMIPv6 Operations 
  
    This section describes the F-HMIPv6 operations for fast handover in 
    HMIPv6 networks. The control messages for F-HMIPv6 are identical to 
    those for FMIPv6, except for the source/destination addresses of IP 
    fields. The correspondent node (CN) and Home Agent (HA) operations 
    will not be affected.  
      
    Basically, the F-HMIPv6 procedures described in this section are 
    based on the assumption that the MAP has already the information 
    about all the ARs located in the HMIPv6 domain, including the network 
    prefix and link layer identifier/address of the respective ARs.  
  
    The behaviors of MN and MAP in F-HMIPv6 are identical to those 
    defined in the HMIPv6 document. In addition, when an MN is about to 
    change its subnet within the HMIPv6 domain (i.e., to change LCoA from 
    PLCoA to NLCoA), the F-HMIPv6 procedures will be applied for fast 
    handover. 
     
    The overall F-HMIPv6 procedures are illustrated in Figure 4.

    (1) When an MN receives information about L2 handover anticipation in 
       the PAR region, it sends the RtSolPr message to MAP (not PAR). 
       The RtSolPr will contain information about the link layer address 
       or identifier of the NAR. 
     
    (2) In response to the RtSolPr message, the MAP sends the PrRtAdv 
       message to the MN, which may contain information about the pre-
       configured NLCoA.  
     
    (3) The MN sends Fast Binding Update (FBU) message to MAP, as done in 
       FMIPv6. 
     
    (4) After receiving the FBU message from MN, the MAP will send a 
       Handover Initiate (HI) message to the NAR so as to establish a 
       bi-directional tunnel.  
     
       In response to the HI message, the NAR will set up a host route 
       entry for the MN's PLCoA and then respond with a Handover 
       Acknowledge (HACK) message.  
        
       As a result of exchanging these HI and HACK messages, a bi-
       directional tunnel between MAP and NAR will be established. By 
       this, the MAP and NAR will be informed about PLCoA, NLCoA and 
       link layer address of the MN. 
        
    (5) After successfully establishing the bi-directional tunnel, the 
       MAP sends the Fast Binding ACK (FBACK) messages toward the MN via 
       both PAR and NAR. 
     
    (6) Then, the MAP will begin to forward the data packets destined to 
       MN to the NAR by using the established tunnel, until the MN 
       complete a new Local BU to MAP, as done in HMIPv6. 
     
    Over the tunnel, the data packets sent by MAP have the additional 
    outer IP header with the following IP fields of <Source = MAP, 
    Destination = NAR>. The NAR may cache those data packets flowing from 
    the MAP, until it receives the RS (with FNA option) message from the 
    newly incoming MN.  
     
    The NAR will begin to deliver the cached data packets, when it 
    receives the RS message from the MN. On the other hand, the MAP will 
    clear the tunnel for fast handover, when it receives the new Local 
    Binding Update with NLCoA from the MN. 
     
    The remaining handover procedures are identical to those defined in 
    the FMIPv6.

 5. Messages for F-HMIPv6  
     
    The F-HMIPv6 uses all the messages defined in FMIPv6 and HMIPv6 with 
    the following exceptions: 
     
    - A new flag is defined in the HMIPv6 MAP option, so as to indicate 
     whether the MAP supports the F-HMIPv6 or not within the HMIPv6 
     domain.  
     
    - Some of the FMIPv6 messages have different IP source and 
     destination addresses in the respective IP fields. In particular, 
     the MAP address is used instead of the PAR address. 
     
     
 5.1 A New Flag in the HMIPv6 MAP Option 
     
    When a MN moves into a new MAP domain, it receives the Router 
    Advertisement with a MAP option from an access router. When the F bit 
    set in the MAP option indicates that the mobile node MAY use F-HMIPv6. 
    If the MN is not aware of F-HMIPv6, or the F bit is not set, it 
    SHOULD NOT use F-HMIPv6.

 5.2 Use of FMIPv6 messages 
     
    F-HMIPv6 uses the messages for fast handover defined in FMIPv6, with 
    different source and destination IP addresses. Table 1 summarizes the 
    use of these messages.

 6. Further Considerations on F-HMIPv6 
     
    In this section, several issues are described for further 
    considerations. Some of them may be incorporated into the main part 
    of this document after appropriate resolution. 
     
 6.1 F-HMIPv6 based on Access Routers 
     
    In this document, it is assumed that the MAP has already all the 
    information about Access Routers located within the HMIPv6 domain, 
    which includes the network prefix and link layer address of the 
    respective ARs. 
     
    In certain cases, as done in FMIPv6, the network administrator may 
    prefer that all the ARs share all the necessary information with 
    their neighboring ARs.

 INTERNET DRAFT         Fast Handover for HMIPv6               May 2003 
  
    In this scenario, the RtSolPr may be sent to the PAR, rather than the 
    MAP, as done in FMIPv6. The PAR will then respond with the PrRtAdv 
    message that contains a new NLCoA address, as shown in Figure 6.

               | RtSolPr       |               |               |  
               |-------------->|               |               |  
               | PrRtAdv       |               |               |  
               |<--------------|               |               |    
               |      FBU      |               |     HI        |

                     Figure 6: F-HMIPv6 based on ARs  
     
     
    The remaining procedures are the same with those for F-HMIPv6, as 
    described in Section 4. How to integrate the F-HMIPv6 and the 
    existing FMIPv6 is for further study. 
     
     
 6.2 Fast Handover between different MAP domains 
  
    This document focuses on the fast handover within an HMIPv6 domain. 
    It is also noted that one of the challenging issues is how to support 
    the fast handover between different MAP domains. 
     
    For Inter-MAP handover, we may need to address the following issues:  
     
    (1) Fast movement detection in the new MAP domain 
     
       When a MN moves to a new MAP domain, it may need to obtain the 
       associated MAP information for fast handover, before the normal 
       HMIPv6 Local BU procedures begin. To do this, the HMIPv6 MAP 
       option may be contained in the RtSolPr and/or PrRtAdv messages. 
     
    (2) Tunneling between MAPs  
     
       For fast handover between different MAPs, the bi-directional 
       tunneling may need to be established between the associated old 
       and new MAPs.  
        
       Such tunneling may need to be extended from the new MAP toward 
       the new Access Router attached to the MAP.

    (3) BU procedure 
        
       For the inter-MAP handover, the MN needs to perform the Binding 
       Updates with the CN and HA, as well as the local binding update 
       with the new MAP. 
        
    Additional considerations on inter-MAP handover are for further study. 
     
     
 6.3 Bicasting in F-HMIPv6 
  
    It is noted that the bicasting can be used to enhance the handover 
    performance, in particular, for addressing the ping-pong effect. In 
    F-HMIPv6, it is strongly recommended that the bicasting be used for 
    stable and fast handover. 
     
    Figure 7 shows the bicasting scenario in F-HMIPv6. 
     
     
     
              MN             PAR             MAP             NAR

    In F-HMIPv6, if the bicasting is enabled, when the packet forwarding 
    to the NAR is indicated, the MAP will also continue to send the data 
    packets to the MN (over PLCoA). That is, after transmitting the FBACK 
    messages, the MAP will send the data packets destined to MN toward 
    the NAR over the established tunnel as well as the MN over the PLCoA. 
     
    The packet forwarding to the MN over PLCoA will stop, when the MAP 
    receives a new Local Binding Update (by HMIPv6) from the MN that has 
    moved into the NAR. 
     
     
 6.4 Other Naming of F-HMIPv6 Messages 
  
    The F-HMIPv6 uses the RtSolPr and PrRtAdv messages, as defined in 
    FMIPv6. It is noted that those messages are exchanged between MN and 
    MAP in F-HMIPv6, not between MN and PAR in FMIPv6.  
     
    In F-HMIPv6, those messages may be named differently from F-HMIPv6 in 
    the future so as to indicate such distinction. 
     
  
 6.5 Use of L2 Triggers in F-HMIPv6 
  
    Issues on the use of L2 triggers for fast handover are the same with 
    those in FMIPv6 [5]. With help of the various L2 triggers such as 
    source and target triggers, the F-HMIPv6 mechanisms could be 
    simplified and enhanced, which is for further study. 
     
     
 6.6 Unidirectional tunnel between MAP and NAR 
     
    In FMIPv6, the tunnel between PAR and NAR is bi-directional. In 
    HMIPv6, however, the MN may send the data packets directly to the CN 
    without using the tunnel with MAP, if the RCoA could be used in the 
    AR region. 
     
    Accordingly, the F-HMIPv6 tunnel from MAP to NAR may not be 
    necessarily bi-directional, differently from FMIPv6. In the 
    unidirectional tunneling case, the MN will send the data packets to 
    the CN without tunneling (i.e., with the IP fields of <Source = RCoA, 
    Destination = CN>), regardless of being in the PAR or NAR regions. 
     
     
 6.7 Consideration of Network-Initiated Handover 
     
    The F-HMIPv6 described in this document may be particularly useful 
    for Mobile-Initiated Handover scenarios or for the wireless networks 
    where the MN needs to send a solicitation by anticipating the 
    movement (e.g. WLAN).  

  
  
 Jung, Lee, Koh, Soliman, El-Malki                            [Page 13] 
 INTERNET DRAFT         Fast Handover for HMIPv6               May 2003 
  
     
    For some network links such as cellular network or for a Network-
    Initiated handover scenario, there may be no need for the 
    solicitation message. In this case, the ARs would already know that 
    the MN is about to move and where it is going toward, so the 
    appropriate AR could send an unsolicited PrRtAdv to the MN. 
     
    Inclusion of such network-initiated handover case into the F-HMIPv6 
    will be done in the future. 
     
     
 6.8 Tunnel Extension and HI/HACK Messages 
     
    Another flavor of this F-HMIPv6 solution can be achieved if the  
    HI/HACK exchanges are eliminated. In this case, the MN may instead be 
    required to use optimistic DAD, which will work almost all the time.  
     
    As an alternative, the tunnel from MAP for Fast Handover can be 
    terminated to the MN, not the NAR. This will be helpful to reduce the 
    signaling of HI/HACK and also to avoid having to send a local BU, 
    after F-BU (i.e. only one local BU would be sufficient). This 
    extensional use will be examined in the further works. 
     
     
 7. Security Considerations  
    
    The security issues on F-HMIPv6 are basically the same with those on 
    FMIPv6 and HMIPv6.  
     
    Noting that the MN and the MAP could have an IPsec SA in the HMIPv6, 
    the PrRtSol and PrRtAdv messages can be protected with IPsec. This 
    feature actually provides an advantage over FMIPv6 where ND messages 
    cannot be secured in its present form. 
     
    In addition, the MAP MUST ensure that the RtSolPr and FBU packets 
    arrived from an MN that legitimately owns the RCoA. Otherwise, a 
    bogus node could attempt to disrupt packets meant for the MN and 
    redirect them to some access router.
