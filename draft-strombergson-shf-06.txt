1.  Introduction

   In the computing, network and embedded systems communities several
   different types of data formats for hexadecimal data are being used.
   One of the more common formats is known as "S-records" (and several
   derivatives) which reportedly originated at the Motorola company.
   The S Hexdump Format is named in its honour.

   Typical uses of these dump formats include executable object code for
   embedded systems (i.e.  "firmware"), on-chip flash memories and
   filesystems, FPGA configuration bitstreams, graphics and other
   application resources, routing tables, etc.  Unfortunately, none of
   the formats used are truly open, vendor neutral and/or well defined.

   Even more problematic is the fact that none of these formats are able
   to represent data sizes that are getting more and more common.  Data
   dumps comprised of multiple sub-blocks with different Word sizes,
   data sizes spanning anywhere from a few Bytes of data to data sizes
   much larger than 2^32 bits are not handled.  Also, the checksums
   included in these formats are too simplistic and for larger data
   sizes provides insufficient ability to accurately detect errors.
   Alternatively, the overhead needed for proper error detection is very
   large.

   The S Hexdump format therefore is an effort to provide a modern,
   XML-based format that is not too complex for simple tools and
   computing environments to implement, generate, parse and use.  Yet
   the format is able to handle large data sizes and complex data
   structures and can provide high quality error detection by leveraging
   standardized cryptographic hash functions.

   One of the simplifications introduced in the format is to disallow
   other number systems such as octal or decimal notation, and to allow
   for Word sizes of even bytes (8-bit groups) only.  This is
   intentional and was done to simplify implementations aimed for
   practical present-day applications.  Formats aimed for esoteric
   number systems or odd Word sizes may be implemented elsewhere.

   At present, the usage of the SHF format may be mainly for Internet
   transport and file storage on development machinery.  A parser for
   the XML format is presently not easily deployed in hardware devices,
   but the parsing and checksumming of the SHF data may be done by a
   workstation computer, which in turn converts the SHF tokens to an
   ordinary bitstream before the last step (e.g., of a firmware upgrade)
   commence.

   SHF is a dump format only and shall not be confused with similar
   applications, such as binary configuration formats or patches, which

   are intended to e.g.  alter contents of a core memory.  Such
   applications require the possibility to modify individual bits or
   groups of bits in the memory of a machine, and is not the intended
   usage of the mechanism described in the present document.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

   The key word Byte is to be interpreted as a group of 8 bits.  The key
   word Octet is another name for Byte.

   The key word Word is to be interpreted as a group containing an
   integral number of Bytes.

   The key word Block is to be interpreted as an ordered sequence of
   Words, beginning at a certain address, running from lower to higher
   addresses.  A Block typically represents a sequence of Words at a
   certain address range in the memory of a computer.

   The key word Dump is to be interpreted as a sequence of Blocks, which
   may or may not be in a particular order.  A Dump typically represents
   some non-continous, interesting parts of the memory of a computer,
   such that the Dump as a whole has a certain meaning, for example (but
   not limited to) a complete firmware for an embedded system.

   The expression 2^n is to be interpreted as the value two (2) raised
   to the n:th power.  For example 2^8 equals the value 256.

3.  Features and functionality

   The SHF-format has the following features:
   o  Support for arbitrarily wide data Words
   o  Support for very large data Blocks
   o  Support for an arbitrary number of independent data Blocks
   o  Data integrity detection against errors provided by the RFC3174
      specified (see [2]) SHA-1 cryptographic signature
   o  An XML-based format

   In the embedded systems domain, 8- and 16-bit processors are still
   used in large numbers and will continue to be used for any forseeable
   future.  Simultaneously, more and more systems are using 64-bit and
   even larger Word sizes.

   SHF supports all of these systems by allowing the Word size to be
   specified.  The Word size MUST be an integer number of Bytes and at
   least one (1) Byte.

   SHF is able to represent both large and small data Blocks.  The data
   Block MUST contain at least one (1) Word.  Additionally, the data
   Block MUST NOT be larger than (2^64)-1 bits.

   The SHF Dump MUST contain at least one (1) data Block.  The maximum
   number of Blocks supported is 2^64.  Each data Block in the Dump MAY
   have different Word sizes and start at different addresses.

   The checksum (or message digest) used to verify the correctness or
   data integrity of each Block is 20 Bytes (160 bits) long.  The digest
   MUST be calculated on the data actually represented by the SHF data
   Block, NOT the representation, i.e.  NOT the ASCII-code.  SHA-1 is
   only able to calculate a digest for a data Block no larger than
   (2^64)-1 bits and this limits the size of each data Block in SHF to
   (2^64)-1 bits.

4.  SHF XML specification

   The SHF format consists of an XML data structure representing a Dump.
   The Dump consists of a Dump header section and one (1) or more Block
   sections containing data.  Each Block of data is independent of any
   other Block.

   A short, symbolic example of a SHF Dump is illustrated by the
   following structure:


   <dump name="(Human readable string)" blocks="(64 bit value)">
     <block name="(Human readable string)" start_address="(64 bit
            value)" word_size="(64 bit value)" length="(64 bit value)"
            checksum="(20 Byte digest)">
        (Data)
     </block>
   </dump>


4.1  Header section

   The header section comprises the Dump tag, which includes the
   following attributes:

   o  name: A compulsory string of arbitrary length used by any
      interested party to identify the specific SHF Dump.
   o  blocks: An optional 64 bit hexadecimal value representing the
      number of Blocks in the specific SHF Dump.  Whenever available,
      this value should be supplied.  There are however potential
      scenarios where the number of Blocks cannot be given beforehand.
      If the value is present, it should be verified by implementers: if
      the value is untrue the behaviour is implementation-defined.

   After the opening Dump tag, one or more subsections of Blocks must
   follow.  Finally, the complete SHF Dump ends with a closing Dump tag.

4.2  Block subsection

   The Block subsection contains a Block tag and a number of data words
   The Block tag includes the following attributes:

   o  name: A compulsory string of arbitrary length used by any
      interested party to identify the specific Block.
   o  start_address: A compulsory 64 bit hexadecimal value representing
      the start address in Bytes for the data in the Block.
   o  word_size: A compulsory 64 bit hexadecimal value representing the
      number of Bytes (the width) of one Word of the data.

Internet-Draft            The S Hexdump Format                March 2005


   o  length: A compulsory hexadecimal representation of an unsigned
      64-bit integer indicating the number of Words following inside the
      Block element.  If this value turns out to be untrue, the Block
      MUST be discarded.
   o  checksum: A compulsory hexadecimal representation of the 20 Byte
      SHA-1 digest of the data in the Block.

   The total size of the data in the Block (in bits) is given by the
   expression (8 * word_size * length).  The expression MUST NOT be
   larger than (2^64)-1.

   After the opening Block tag, a hexadecimal representation of the
   actual data in the Block follows.  Finally, the Block section ends
   with a closing Block tag.

5.  SHF rules and limits

   There are several rules and limits in SHF:
   o  All attribute values representing an actual value and the data
      MUST be in hexadecimal notation.  The only attribute excluded from
      this rule is the name attribute in the Dump and Block tags.  This
      restriction has been imposed for ease of reading the dump: a
      reader shall not be uncertain about whether a figure is in hex
      notation or not, and can always assume it is hexadecimal.
   o  All attribute values with the exception for the checksum MAY omit
      leading zeros.  Conversely, the checksum MUST NOT omit leading
      zeros.
   o  The data represented in a Block MUST NOT be larger than (2^64)-1
      bits.
   o  The size of a Word MUST NOT be larger than (2^64)-1 bits.  This
      implies that a Block with a Word defined to the maximum width can
      not contain more than one Word.  An SHF consumer shall assure that
      it can handle a certain Word length before beginning to parse
      blocks of an SHF Dump.  Failure to do so may cause buffer
      overflows and endanger the stability and security of the system
      running the consuming application.
   o  The attribute values representing an actual value MUST be in "Big
      Endian-format".  This means that the most significant hexadecimal
      digits are to be put to the left in a hexadecimal Word, address or
      similar field, so that e.g.  the address value 1234 represents the
      address 1234 and not 3412.  While some computing architectures may
      be using Little Endian Words as their native format, it is the
      responsibility of any SHF producer running on such an architecture
      to swap the attribute values to a Big Endian format.  The reverse
      holds for a consumer receiving the Big Endian SHF attributes: if
      the consumer is Little Endian, the values have to be swapped
      around.
   o  The words inside a Dump MUST likewise be stored in a Big Endian
      format if the word size is larger than one Byte.  Here the same
      need for swapping Bytes around may arise as mentioned in the
      previous paragraph.

6.  SHF DTD

   The contents of the element named "block" and the attributes
   "blocks", "address", "word_size" and "checksum" should only contain
   the characters that are valid hexbyte sequences.  These are:

    whitespace ::= (#x20 | #x9 | #xC | #xD | #xA)
    hexdigit   ::= [0-9A-Fa-f]
    hexbytes   ::= whitespace* hexdigit (hexdigit|whitespace)*

    A parser reading in an SHF file should silently ignore any other
   characters that (by mistake) appear in any of these elements or
   attributes.  These alien characters should be treated as if they did
   not exist.  Also note that "whitespace" has no semantic meaning; it
   is only valid for the reason of improving the human readability of
   the Dump.  Whitespace may be altogether removed and the hexbyte
   sequences concatenated if desired.  Notice that the fact that word
   size is to be given in a number of bytes implies that the number of
   hexadecimal digits inside a block need to be even.  Malformed blocks
   should be ignored by implementations.

7.  SHF examples

   This section contains three different SHF examples, illustrating the
   usage of SHF and the attributes in SHF.

   The first example is a simple SHF Dump with a single Block of data:

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <dump name="Simple SHF example" blocks="01">
     <block name="Important message in hex format" address="0400"
       word_size="01" length="1f"
       checksum="5601b6acad7da5c7b92036786250b053f05852c3">
         41 6c 6c 20 79 6f 75 72 20 62 61 73 65 20 61 72
         65 20 62 65 6c 6f 6e 67 20 74 6f 20 75 73 0a
     </block>
   </dump>

   The second example is a program in 6502 machine code residing at
   memory address 0x1000, which calculates the 13 first fibonacci
   numbers and stores them at 0x1101-0x110d:

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <dump name="6502 Fibonacci" blocks="02">
     <block name="Code" address="1000" word_size="01" length="2a"
       checksum="5cab5bf8ee299af1ad17e8093d941914eb5930c7">
         a9 01 85 20 85 21 20 1e 10 20 1e 10 18 a5 21 aa
         65 20 86 20 85 21 20 1e 10 c9 c8 90 ef 60 ae 00
         11 a5 21 9d 00 11 ee 00 11 60
     </block>
     <block name="Mem" address="1100" word_size="01" length="e"
       checksum="c8c2001c42b0226a5d9f7c2f24bd47393166487a">
         01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
     </block>
   </dump>

   The final example contains a Block of 40-bit wide data:

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <dump name="Example of a SHF dump with wide data words" blocks="00001">
     <block name="SMIL memory dump" address="000" word_size="5"
            length="1A" checksum="ff2033489aff0e4e4f0cd7901afc985f7a213c97">
         00100 00200 00000 00090 00000 00036 00300 00400
         00852 00250 00230 00858 00500 00600 014DC 00058

8.  SHF security considerations

   The SHF format is a format for representing hexadecimal data that one
   wants to transfer, manage or transform.  The format itself does not
   guarantee that the represented data is not falsely represented,
   malicious or otherwise dangerous.

   The data integrity of the SHF file as a whole is to be provided, if
   needed, by means external to the SHF file, such as the generic
   signing mechanism described by RFC 3275 [3].

9.  IANA Considerations

   This section contains the registration information for the MIME type
   to SHF.

   o  Registration: application/shf+xml
   o  MIME media type name: application
   o  MIME subtype name: shf+xml
   o  Required parameters: charset

   Required parameters: charset

   This parameter must exist and must be set to "UTF-8".  No other
   character sets are allowed for transporting SHF data.  The character
   set designator MUST be uppercase.

   Encoding considerations

   This media type may contain binary content; accordingly, when used
   over a transport that does not permit binary transfer, an appropriate
   encoding must be applied.

   Security considerations

   A hex Dump in itself has no other security considerations than what
   applies for any other XML file.  However the included binary data may
   in decoded form contain any executable code for a target platform.
   If additional security is desired, additional transport security
   solutions may be applied.  For target code contained in a hex Dump,
   developers may want to include certificates, checksums and the like
   in hexdump form for the target platform.  Such uses are outside the
   scope of this document and a matter of implementation.

   Interoperability considerations

   n/a

   Published specification

   This media type is a proper subset of the the XML 1.0 specification
   [WWWXML].  One restriction is made: no entity references other than
   the five predefined general entities references ("&", "<", ">", "'",
   and """) and numeric entity references may be present.  Neither the
   "XML" declaration (e.g., ) nor the "DOCTYPE" declaration (e.g., )
   need be present.  (XML fragments are allowed.) All other XML 1.0
   instructions (e.g., CDATA blocks, processing instructions, and so on)
   are allowed.

10.  Extensions

   The attributes of elements in the SHF XML format may be extended when
   need arise.  For example, certain applications will want to represent
   executable code as a SHF Dump and may then need a execution start
   address to be associated with certain Dump Blocks, so that the
   address can be configured as a starting point for the CPU part of any
   processor code present in the Block, as opposed to the raw data which
   is already given a start address by way of the "address" attribute.
   This can be done by extending the Block tag with a "start_address"
   attribute.

   Another possible scenario is when a dump is applied to a computer
   system with several independent address spaces, such as a system with
   two CPU:s with independent memories.  In this case, a user may want
   to add an "address_space" attribute.

   As long as such new attributes are added, with no attributes being
   removed or redefined, the resulting Dump shall be considered a valid
   SHF Dump, transported using the application/xml+shf transport type,
   and parsers unaware of the modified namespace shall silently ignore
   any such extended attributes, or simply duplicate them from input to
   output when processing an SHF file as a filter.  The management of
   such extended attributes is a matter of convention between different
   classes of users and not a matter of the IETF.
