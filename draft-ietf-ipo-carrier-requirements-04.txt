     Abstract 
     This Internet Draft describes the major carrier's optical service requirements 
     for the Automatically Switched Optical Networks (ASON) from both an end-user's 
     as well as an operator's perspectives. Its focus is on the description of the 
     service building blocks and service-related control plane functional 
     requirements. The management functions for the optical services and their 
     underlying networks are beyond the scope of this document and will be addressed 
     in a separate document.

     1. Introduction 
 
     Optical transport networks are evolving from the current TDM-based SONET/SDH 
     optical networks as defined by ANSI T1.105 and ITU Rec. G.803[ansi-sonet, itu-
     sdh] to emerging WDM-based optical transport networks (OTN) as defined by ITU 
     Rec. G.872 in [itu-otn]. Therefore in the near future, carrier optical transport 
     networks are expected to consist of a mixture of the SONET/SDH-based sub-
     networks and the WDM-based wavelength or fiber switched OTN sub-networks. The 
     OTN networks can be either transparent or opaque depending upon if O-E-O 
     functions are utilized within the optical networks. Optical networking 
     encompasses the functionalities for the establishment, transmission, 
     multiplexing and switching of optical connections carrying a wide range of user 
     signals of varying formats and bit rate. The optical connections in this 
     document include switched optical path using TDM channel, WADM wavelength or 
     fiber links. 
      
     Some of the challenges for the carriers are efficient bandwidth management and 
     fast service provisioning in a multi-technology and possibly multi-vendor 
     networking environment. The emerging and rapidly evolving Automatically Switched 
     Optical Network (ASON) technology [itu-astn, itu-ason] is aimed at providing 
     optical networks with intelligent networking functions and capabilities in its 
     control plane to enable rapid optical connection provisioning, dynamic rerouting 
     as well as multiplexing and switching at different granularity levels, including 
     fiber, wavelength and TDM channel. The ASON control plane should not only enable 
     the new networking functions and capabilities for the emerging OTN networks, but 
     significantly enhance the service provisioning capabilities for the existing 
     SONET/SDH networks as well. 
      
     The ultimate goals should be to allow the carriers to automate network resource 
     and topology discovery, to quickly and dynamically provision network resources 
     and circuits,  and to support assorted network survivability using ring and 
     mesh-based protection and restoration techniques. The carriers see that this new 
     networking platform will create tremendous business opportunities for the 
     network operators and service providers to offer new services to the market, and 
     in the long run to reduce their network operation cost (OpEx saving), and to 
     improve their network utilization efficiency (CapEx saving). 
      
     1.1. Justification

     The charter of the IPO WG calls for a document on "Carrier Optical Service 
     Requirements" for IP over Optical networks. This document addresses that aspect 
     of the IPO WG charter. Furthermore, this document was accepted as an IPO WG 
     document by unanimous agreement at the IPO WG meeting held on March 19, 2001, in 
     Minneapolis, MN, USA. It presents a carrier as well as an end-user perspective 
     on optical network services and requirements. 
      
     1.2. Conventions used in this document 
      
     The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT","SHOULD", 
     "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be 
     interpreted as described in RFC 2119. 
      
     1.3. Value Statement 
      
     By deploying ASON technology, a carrier expects to achieve the following 
     benefits from both technical and business perspectives: 
     Automated Discovery: ASON technology will enable automatic network  Inventory 
     management, topology and resource discovery which eliminates the manual or semi-
     manual process for maintaining the network information database that exist in 
     most carrier environment. 
      
     Rapid Circuit Provisioning: ASON technology will enable the dynamic end-to-end 
     provisioning of the optical connections across the optical network by using 
     standard routing and signaling protocols. 
      
     Enhanced Protection and Restoration: ASON technology will enable the network to 
     dynamically reroute an optical connection in case of failure using mesh-based 
     network protection and restoration techniques, which greatly improves the cost-
     effectiveness compared to the current line and ring protection schemes in the 
     SONET/SDH network. 
      
     - Service Flexibility: ASON technology will support provisioning of 
     an assortment of existing and new services such as protocol and bit- 
     rate independent transparent network services, and bandwidth-on- 
     demand services. 
      
     - Enhanced Interoperability: ASON technology will use a control plane 
     utilizing industry and international standards-based architecture and 
     protocols, which facilitate the interoperability of the optical 
     network equipment from different vendors. 
      
      
     In addition, the ASON control plane may offer the following potential  
     value-added benefits: 
      
     - Reactive traffic engineering at optical layer that allows network 
     resources to be dynamically allocated to traffic flow. 
      
     - Reduce the need for service providers to develop new operational 
     support systems (OSS) software for the network control and new service

     provisioning on the optical network, thus speeding up the deployment 
     of the optical network technology and reducing the software 
     development and maintenance cost. 
      
     - Potential development of a unified control plane that can be used 
     for different transport technologies including OTN, SONET/SDH, ATM 
     and PDH. 
      
     1.4.  Scope of this document 
      
     This document is intended to provide, from the carriers perspective, 
     a service framework and some associated requirements in relation to 
     the optical transport services to be offered in the next generation optical 
     transport networking environment and their service control and 
     management functions.  As such, this document concentrates on the 
     requirements driving the work towards realization of the automatic 
     switched optical networks.  This document is intended to be protocol- 
     neutral, but the specific goals include providing the requirements to 
     guide the control protocol development and enhancement within IETF in 
     terms of reuse of IP-centric control protocols in the optical 
     transport network. 
      
     Every carrier's needs are different. The objective of this document 
     is NOT to define some specific service models. Instead, some major 
     service building blocks are identified that will enable the carriers 
     to use them in order to create the best service platform most 
     suitable to their business model. These building blocks include 
     generic service types, service enabling control mechanisms and 
     service control and management functions. 
      
     OIF carrier group has developed a comprehensive set of control plane 
     requirements for both UNI and NNI [oif-carrier, oif-nnireq] and they  
     have been used as the base line input to this document. 
      
     The fundamental principles and basic set of requirements for the 
     control plane of the automatic switched optical networks have been 
     provided in a series of ITU Recommendations under the umbrella of  
     ITU ASTN/ASON architectural and functional requirements as listed

     This document provides further detailed requirements based on the ASTN/ASON 
     framework. In addition, even though for IP over Optical we consider IP as a 
     major client to the optical network in this document, the same requirements 
     and principles should be equally applicable to non-IP clients such as 
     SONET/SDH, ATM, ITU G.709, Ethernet, etc. The general architecture for IP over

     3. General Requirements 
     In order to provide the carriers with flexibility and control of the optical 
     networks, the following set of architectural requirements are essential. 
      
     3.1. Separation of Networking Functions 
      
     A fundamental architectural principle of the ASON network  
     is to segregate the networking functions within 
     each layer network into three logical functional planes: control 
     plane, data plane and management plane. They are responsible for

      Y. Xue et al 
                                    
     providing network control functions, data transmission functions and 
     network management functions respectively. The crux of the ASON 
     network is the networking intelligence that contains automatic 
     routing, signaling and discovery functions to automate the network 
     control functions. 
      
     Control Plane: includes the functions related to networking control 
     capabilities such as routing, signaling, and policy control, as well 
     as resource and service discovery. These functions are automated. 
      
     Data Plane (Transport Plane): includes the functions related to 
     bearer channels and signal transmission. 
      
     Management Plane: includes the functions related to the management 
     functions of network element, networks and network resources and 
     services. These functions are less automated as compared to control 
     plane functions. 
      
     Each plane consists of a set of interconnected functional or control 
     entities, physical or logical, responsible for providing the 
     networking or control functions defined for that network layer. 
      
     Each plane has clearly defined functional responsibilities. However, the 
     management plane is responsible for the management of both control and data 
     planes, thus playing an authoritative role in overall control and management 
     functions as discussed in Section 8. 
      
     The separation of the control plane from both the data and management 
     plane is beneficial to the carriers in that it: 
      
     - Allows equipment vendors to have a modular system design that will 
     be more reliable and maintainable. 
      
     - Allows carriers to have the flexibility to choose a third party 
     vendor control plane software systems as the control plane solution 
     for its switched optical network. 
      
     - Allows carriers to deploy a unified control plane and 
     OSS/management systems to manage and control different types of 
     transport networks it owns. 
      
     - Allows carriers to use a separate control network specially 
     designed and engineered for the control plane communications. 
      
      
     The separation of control, management and transport function is 
     required and it shall accommodate both logical and physical level 
     separation. The logical separation refers to functional separation while 
     physical separation refers to the case where the control, management and 
     transport functions physically reside in different equipment or locations. 
      
 
     draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-04.txt            [page 7] 
 
                                    
                                    
      Y. Xue et al 
                                    
     Note that it is in contrast to the IP network where the control 
     messages and user traffic are routed and switched based on the same 
     network topology due to the associated in-band signaling nature of 
     the IP network. 
      
     When the physical separation is allowed between the control and data plane, a 
     standardized interface and control protocol (e.g. GSMP [ietf-gsmp]) should be 
     supported. 
      
     3.2. Separation of call and connection control 
      
     To support many enhanced optical services, such as scheduled 
     bandwidth on demand, diverse circuit provisioning and bundled connections, a 
     call model based on the separation of call control and connection control is 
     essential. 
      
     The call control is responsible for the end-to-end session 
     negotiation, call admission control and call state maintenance while 
     connection control is responsible for setting up the connections 
     associated with a call across the network. A call can correspond to 
     zero, one or more connections depending upon the number of 
     connections needed to support the call. 
      
     The existence of the connection depends upon the existence of its 
     associated call session and connection can be deleted and re- 
     established while still keeping the call session up. 
      
     The call control shall be provided at an ingress port or gateway port 
     to the network such as UNI and E-NNI [ see Section 5 for definition].  
     The connection control is provided at the originating node of the circuit as 
     well as on each link along the path. 
      
     The control plane shall support the separation of the call control 
     from the connection control. 
      
     The control plane shall support call  admission control on call setup 
     and connection admission control on connection setup. 
      
     3.3.  Network and Service Scalability 
      
     Although some specific applications or networks may be on a small 
     scale, the control plane protocol and functional capabilities shall 
     support large-scale networks. 
      
     In terms of the scale and complexity of the future optical network, 
     the following assumption can be made when considering the scalability 
     and performance that are required of the optical control and 
     management functions. 
      
     - There may be up to thousands of OXC nodes and the same or higher 
     order of magnitude of OADMs per carrier network. 
 
     draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-04.txt            [page 8] 
 
                                    
                                    
      Y. Xue et al 
                                    
      
     - There may be up to thousands of terminating ports/wavelength per 
     OXC node. 
      
     - There may be up to hundreds of parallel fibers between a pair of 
     OXC nodes. 
      
     - There may be up to hundreds of wavelength channels transmitted on 
     each fiber. 
      
     As for the frequency and duration of the optical connections: 
      
     - The expected end-to-end connection setup/teardown time should be in 
     the order of seconds, preferably less. 
      
     - The expected connection holding times should be in the order of 
     minutes or greater. 
      
     - There may be up to millions of simultaneous optical connections 
     switched across a single carrier network. 
      
     3.4. Transport Network Technology 
      
     Optical services can be offered over different types of underlying 
     optical transport technologies including both TDM-based SONET/SDH 
     network and WDM-based OTN networks. 
      
     For this document, standards-based transport technologies SONET/SDH 
     as defined in the ITU Rec. G.803 and OTN implementation framing as 
     defined in ITU Rec. G.709 [itu-g709] shall be supported. 
      
     Note that the service characteristics such as bandwidth granularity 
     and signaling framing hierarchy to a large degree will be determined 
     by the capabilities and constraints of the server layer network. 
      
     3.5.  Service Building Blocks 
      
     The primary goal of this document is to identify a set of basic 
     service building blocks the carriers can use to create the best 
     suitable service models that serve their business needs. 
      
     The service building blocks are comprised of a well-defined set of 
     capabilities and a basic set of control and management functions. 
     These capabilities and functions should support a basic set of 
     services and enable a carrier to build enhanced services through 
     extensions and customizations. Examples of the building blocks 
     include the connection types, provisioning methods, control 
     interfaces, policy control functions, and domain internetworking 
     mechanisms, etc. 
      
     4.  Service Model and Applications 
 
     draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-04.txt            [page 9] 
 
                                    
                                    
      Y. Xue et al 
                                    
      
     A carrier's optical network supports multiple types of service 
     models. Each service model may have its own service operations, 
     target markets, and service management requirements. 
      
     4.1.  Service and Connection Types 
      
     The optical network is primarily offering optical paths that are  
     fixed bandwidth connections between two client network elements, such 
     as IP routers or ATM switches, established across the optical 
     network. A connection is also defined by its demarcation from ingress 
     access point, across the optical network, to egress access point of 
     the optical network. 
      
     The following connection capability topologies must be supported: 
      
     - Bi-directional point-to-point connection 
      
     - Uni-directional point-to-point connection 
      
     - Uni-directional point-to-multipoint connection 
      
     The point-to-point connections are the primary concerns of the carriers. In this 
     case, the following three types of network 
     connections based on different connection set-up control methods 
     shall be supported: 
      
     - Permanent connection (PC): Established hop-by-hop directly on each 
     ONE along a specified path without relying on the network routing and 
     signaling capability. The connection has two fixed end-points and 
     fixed cross-connect configuration along the path and will stays 
     permanently until it is deleted. This is similar to the concept of 
     PVC in ATM and there is no automatic re-routing capability. 
      
     - Switched connection (SC): Established through UNI signaling 
     interface and the connection is dynamically established by network 
     using the network routing and signaling functions. This is similar to the 
     concept of SVC in ATM. 
      
     - Soft permanent connection (SPC): Established by specifying two PC 
     at end-points and let the network dynamically establishes a SC 
     connection in between. This is similar to the SPVC concept in ATM. 
      
     The PC and SPC connections should be provisioned via management plane 
     to control interface and the SC connection should be provisioned via 
     signaled UNI interface. 
      
     Note that even though automated rapid optical connection provisioning 
     is required, the carriers expect the majority of provisioned 
     circuits, at least in short term, to have a long lifespan ranging 
     from months to years. 
 
     draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-04.txt            [page 10] 
 
                                    
                                    
      Y. Xue et al 
                                    
      
     In terms of service provisioning, some carriers may choose to perform 
     testing prior to turning over to the customer. 
      
     4.2.  Examples of Common Service Models 
      
     Each carrier may define its own service model based on it business 
     strategy and environment. The following are three example service 
     models that carriers may use. 
      
     4.2.1.  Provisioned Bandwidth Service (PBS) 
      
     The PBS model provides enhanced leased/private line services 
     provisioned via service management interface (MI)  using either PC or 
     SPC type of connection. The provisioning can be real-time or near 
     real-time. It has the following characteristics: 
      
     - Connection request goes through a well-defined management interface 
      
     - Client/Server relationship between clients and optical network. 
      
     - Clients have no optical network visibility and depend on network 
     intelligence or operator for optical connection setup. 
      
      
     4.2.2.  Bandwidth on Demand Service (BDS) 
      
     The BDS model provides bandwidth-on-demand dynamic connection 
     services via signaled user-network interface (UNI). The provisioning 
     is real-time and is using SC type of optical connection. It has the 
     following characteristics: 
      
     - Signaled connection request via UNI directly from the user or its 
     proxy. 
      
     - Customer has no or limited network visibility depending upon the 
     control interconnection model used and network administrative policy. 
      
     - Relies on network or client intelligence for connection set-up 
     depending upon the control plane interconnection model used. 
      
      
     4.2.3.  Optical Virtual Private Network (OVPN) 
      
     The OVPN model provides virtual private network at the optical layer 
     between a specified set of user sites.  It has the following 
     characteristics: 
      
     - Customers contract for specific set of network resources such as 
     optical connection ports, wavelengths, etc. 
      
 
     draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-04.txt            [page 11] 
 
                                    
                                    
      Y. Xue et al 
                                    
     - Closed User Group (CUG) concept is supported as in normal VPN. 
      
     - Optical connection can be of PC, SPC or SC type depending upon the 
     provisioning method used. 
      
     - An OVPN site can request dynamic reconfiguration of the connections 
     between sites within the same CUG. 
      
     - A customer may have visibility and control of network resources up 
     to the extent allowed by the customer service contract. 
      
     At a minimum, the PBS, BDS and OVPN service models described above 
     shall be supported by the control functions. 
      
     5.  Network Reference Model 
      
     This section discusses major architectural and functional components 
     of a generic carrier optical network, which will provide a reference 
     model for describing the requirements for the control and management 
     of carrier optical services. 
      
     5.1.  Optical Networks and Sub-networks 
      
     As mentioned before, there are two main types of optical networks 
     that are currently under consideration: SDH/SONET network as defined 
     in ITU Rec. G.803, and OTN as defined in ITU Rec. G.872. 
      
     In the current SONET/SDH-based optical network, digital cross-connects (DXC) and 
     add-drop multiplexer (ADM) and line multiplexer terminal (LMT) are connected in 
     ring or linear topology. Similarly, we assume an OTN is composed of a set of 
     optical cross-connects (OXC) and optical add-drop multiplexer (OADM) which is 
     interconnected in a general mesh topology using DWDM optical line systems (OLS). 
      
     It is often convenient for easy discussion and description to treat 
     an optical network as an sub-network cloud, in which the details of 
     the network become less important, instead focus is on the function 
     and the interfaces the optical network provides. In general, a 
     subnetwork can be defined as a set of access points on the network 
     boundary and a set of point-to-point optical connections between 
     those access points. 
 
      
     5.2. Control Domains and Interfaces 
     A generic carrier network reference model describes a multi-carrier 
     network environment. Each individual carrier network can be further 
     partitioned into sub-networks or administrative domains based on administrative, 
     technological or architectural reasons. This partition can be recursive. 
     Similarly, a network can be partitioned into control domains that match the 
     administrative domains and are controlled by a single administrative policy.  
     The control domains can be recursively divided into sub-domains to form control 
     hierarchy for scalability. The control domain concept can be applied to routing, 
 
     draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-04.txt            [page 12] 
 
                                    
                                    
      Y. Xue et al 
                                    
     signaling and protection & restoration to form an autonomous control function 
     domain. 
 
     The demarcation between domains can be either logical or physical and consists 
     of a set of reference points identifiable in the optical network. >From the 
     control plane perspective, these reference points define a set of 
     control interfaces in terms of optical control and management 
     functionality. The figure 1 is an illustrative diagram for this.

     The network interfaces encompass two aspects of the networking 
     functions: user data plane interface and control plane interface. The 
     former concerns about user data transmission across the physical 
     network interface and the latter concerns about the control message 
     exchange across the network interface such as signaling, routing, 
     etc. We call the former physical interface (PI) and the latter 
     control interface. Unless otherwise stated, the control 
     interface is assumed in the remaining of this document.

      Y. Xue et al 
                                    
     Control interface defines a relationship between two connected 
     network entities on both sides of the interface. For each control 
     interface, we need to define the architectural function that each side 
     plays and a controlled set of information that can be exchanged 
     across the interface. The information flowing over this logical 
     interface may include, but not limited to: 
      
     - Interface endpoint name and address 
      
     - Reachability/summarized network address information 
      
     - Topology/routing information 
      
     - Authentication and connection admission control information 
      
     - Connection management signaling messages 
      
     - Network resource control information 
      
     Different types of the interfaces can be defined for the network 
     control and architectural purposes and can be used as the network 
     reference points in the control plane. In this document, the 
     following set of interfaces is defined as shown in Figure 1.  
     User-Network Interface (UNI): is a bi-directional control interface 
     between service requester and service provider control entities. The 
     service request control entity resides outside the carrier network 
     control domain. 
      
     Network-Network/Node-Node Interface (NNI): is a bi-directional signaling 
     interface between two optical network elements or sub-networks. 
      
     We differentiate between internal NNI (I-NNI) and external NNI (E-NNI) as 
     follows: 
      
     - E-NNI: A NNI interface between two control plane entities belonging 
     to different control domains. 
      
     - I-NNI: A NNI interface between two control plane entities within 
     the same control domain in the carrier network. 
      
     Different types of interface, internal vs. external, have different implied 
     trust relationship for security and access control purposes. The trust 
     relationship is not binary, instead a policy-based control mechanism need to be 
     in place to restrict the type and amount of information that can flow cross each 
     type of interfaces depending the carrier's service and business requirements. 
     Generally, two networks have a fully trusted relationship if they belong to 
     the same administrative domain, in this case, the control information exchange 
     across the control interface between them should be unlimited. Otherwise, the 
     type and amount of the control information that can go across the information 
     should be constrained by the administrative policy. 
      
 
     draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-04.txt            [page 14] 
 
                                    
                                    
      Y. Xue et al 
                                    
     An example of fully trusted interface is an I-NNI between two optical 
     network elements in a single control domain. Non-trusted interface 
     examples include an E-NNI between two different carriers or a UNI 
     interface between a carrier optical network and its customers. The trust level 
     can be different for the non-trusted UNI or E-NNI interface depending upon if it 
     within the carrier or not.  In general, intra-carrier E-NNI has higher trust 
     level than inter-carrier E-NNI. 
      
     The control plane shall support the UNI and NNI interface described 
     above and the interfaces shall be configurable in terms of the type 
     and amount of control information exchange and their behavior shall 
     be consistent with the configuration (i.e., external versus internal 
     interfaces). 
      
     5.3. Intra-Carrier Network Model 
      
     Intra-carrier network model concerns the network service control and 
     management issues within networks owned by a single carrier. 
      
     5.3.1. Multiple Sub-networks 
      
     Without loss of generality, the optical network owned by a carrier 
     service operator can be depicted as consisting of one or more optical 
     sub-networks interconnected by direct optical links. There may be 
     many different reasons for more than one optical sub-network. It may 
     be the result of using hierarchical layering, different technologies 
     across access, metro and long haul (as discussed below), or a result 
     of business mergers and acquisitions or incremental optical network 
     technology deployment by the carrier using different vendors or 
     technologies. 
      
     A sub-network may be a single vendor and single technology network. 
     But in general, the carrier's optical network is heterogeneous in 
     terms of equipment vendor and the technology utilized in each sub- 
     network. 
      
     5.3.2.  Access, Metro and Long-haul networks 
      
     Few carriers have end-to-end ownership of the optical networks. Even 
     if they do, access, metro and long-haul networks often belong to 
     different administrative divisions as separate optical sub-networks. 
     Therefore Inter-(sub)-networks interconnection is essential in terms 
     of supporting the end-to-end optical service provisioning and 
     management. The access, metro and long-haul networks may use 
     different technologies and architectures, and as such may have 
     different network properties. 
      
     In general, end-to-end optical connectivity may easily cross multiple 
     sub-networks with the following possible scenarios: 
     Access -- Metro -- Access 
     Access - Metro -- Long Haul -- Metro - Access

      Y. Xue et al 
                                    
      
     5.4.  Inter-Carrier Network Model 
      
     The inter-carrier model focuses on the service and control aspects 
     between different carrier networks and describes the internetworking 
     relationship between them. 
      
     Inter-carrier interconnection provides for connectivity between 
     optical network operators. To provide the global reach end-to-end 
     optical services, optical service control and management between 
     different carrier networks becomes essential. It is possible to 
     support distributed peering within the IP client layer network where 
     the connectivity between two distant IP routers can be achieved via 
     an optical transport network. 
      
     5.5. Implied Control Constraints 
      
     The intra-carrier and inter-carrier models have different implied control 
     constraints. For example, in the intra-carrier model, the address for routing 
     and signaling only need to be unique with the carrier while the inter-carrier 
     model requires the address to be globally unique. 
      
     In the intra-carrier network model, the network itself forms the largest control 
     domain within the carrier network. This domain is usually partitioned into 
     multiple sub-domains, either flat or in hierarchy. The UNI and E-NNI interfaces 
     are internal to the carrier network, therefore higher trust level is assumed. 
     Because of this, direct signaling between domains and summarized topology and 
     resource information exchanged can be allowed across the internal UNI or intra-
     carrier E-NNI interfaces. 
      
     In the inter-carrier network model, each carrier's optical network is 
     a separate administrative domain. Both the UNI interface between the 
     user and the carrier network and the NNI interface between two 
     carrier's networks are crossing the carrier's administrative boundary 
     and therefore are by definition external interfaces. 
      
     In terms of control information exchange, the topology information 
     shall not be allowed to cross both E-NNI and UNI interfaces. 
      
     6.  Optical Service User Requirements 
      
     This section describes the user requirements for optical services, 
     which in turn impose the requirements on service control and 
     management for the network operators. The user requirements reflect 
     the perception of the optical service from a user's point of view. 
      
      
     6.1.  Common Optical Services 
      
     The basic unit of an optical transport service is fixed-bandwidth 
     optical connectivity between applications. However different services are 
 
     draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-04.txt            [page 16] 
 
                                    
                                    
      Y. Xue et al 
                                    
     created based on its supported signal characteristics (format, bit 
     rate, etc), the service invocation methods and possibly the 
     associated Service Level Agreement (SLA) provided by the service 
     provider. 
      
     At present, the following are the major optical services provided in 
     the industry: 
      
     - SONET/SDH, with different degrees of transparency 
      
     - Optical wavelength services, transparent or opaque 
      
     - Ethernet at 10Mbps, 100Mbps, 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps 
      
     - Storage Area Networks (SANs) based on FICON, ESCON and Fiber 
     Channel 
      
     Optical Wavelength Service refers to transport services where signal 
     framing is negotiated between the client and the network operator 
     (framing and bit-rate dependent), and only the payload is carried 
     transparently. SONET/SDH transport is most widely used for network- 
     wide transport. Different levels of transparency can be achieved in 
     the SONET/SDH transmission. 
      
     Ethernet Services, specifically 1Gb/s and 10Gbs Ethernet services, 
     are gaining more popularity due to the lower costs of the customers' 
     premises equipment and its simplified management requirements 
     (compared to SONET or SDH). 
      
     Ethernet services may be carried over either SONET/SDH (GFP mapping) 
     or WDM networks. The Ethernet service requests will require some 
     service specific parameters: priority class, VLAN Id/Tag, traffic 
     aggregation parameters. 
      
     Storage Area Network (SAN) Services. ESCON and FICON are proprietary 
     versions of the service, while Fiber Channel is the standard 
     alternative. As is the case with Ethernet services, SAN services may 
     be carried over either SONET/SDH (using GFP mapping) or WDM networks. 
      
     The control plane shall provide the carrier with the capability 
     functionality to provision, control and manage all the services 
     listed above. 
      
     6.2.  Bearer Interface Types 
      
     All the bearer interfaces implemented in the ONE shall be supported 
     by the control plane and associated signaling protocols. 
      
     The signaling shall support the following interface types 
     protocol: 
     - SDH/SONET 
 
     draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-04.txt            [page 17] 
 
                                    
                                    
      Y. Xue et al 
                                    
     - Ethernet  
     - FC-N for Fiber Channel services 
     - OTN (G.709) 
     - PDH 
     - APON and EPON 
     - ESCON and FICON 
      
     6.3.  Optical Service Invocation 
     As mentioned earlier, the methods of service invocation play an 
     important role in defining different services. 
      
     6.3.1. Provider-Initiated Service Provisioning 
      
     In this scenario, users forward their service request to the provider 
     via a well-defined service management interface. All connection 
     management operations, including set-up, release, query, or 
     modification shall be invoked from the management plane. This provisioning 
     method is for PC and SPC connections. 
      
     6.3.2. User-Initiated Service Provisioning 
      
     In this scenario, users forward their service request to the provider 
     via a well-defined UNI interface in the control plane (including 
     proxy signaling). All connection management operation requests, 
     including set-up, release, query, or modification shall be invoked 
     from directly connected user devices, or its signaling proxy. 
     This provisioning method is for SC connection. 
      
     6.3.3. Call set-up requirements 
     In summary the following requirements for the control plane have been 
     identified: 
     - The control plane shall support action result codes as responses to 
     any requests over the control interfaces. 
      
     - The control plane shall support requests for call set-up, subject 
     to policies in effect between the user and the network. 
      
     - The control plane shall support the destination client device's 
     decision to accept or reject call set-up requests from the source 
     client's device. 
      
     - The control plane shall support requests for call set-up and 
     deletion across multiple (sub)networks. 
      
     - NNI signaling shall support requests for call set-up, subject to 
     policies in effect between the (sub)networks. 
      
     - Call set-up shall be supported for both uni-directional and bi- 
     directional connections. 
      
     - Upon call request initiation, the control plane shall generate a 
 
     draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-04.txt            [page 18] 
 
                                    
                                    
      Y. Xue et al 
                                    
     network unique Call-ID associated with the connection, to be used for 
     information retrieval or other activities related to that connection. 
      
     - CAC shall be provided as part of the call control functionality. It 
     is the role of the CAC function to determine if the call can be 
     allowed to proceed based on resource availability and authentication. 
      
     - Negotiation for call set-up for multiple service level options 
     shall be supported. 
      
     - The policy management system must determine what kinds of call setup  
     requests can be authorized. 
      
     - The control plane elements need the ability to rate limit (or pace) 
     call setup attempts into the network. 
      
     - The control plane shall report to the management plane, the 
     success/failures of a call request. 
      
     - Upon a connection request failure, the control plane shall report 
     to the management plane a cause code identifying the reason for the 
     failure and all allocated resources shall be released. A negative 
     acknowledgment shall be returned to the source. 
      
     - Upon a connection request success a positive acknowledgment shall 
     be returned to the source when a connection has been successfully 
     established. 
      
     - The control plane shall support requests for call release by Call- 
     ID. 
      
     - The control plane shall allow any end point or any intermediate 
     node to initiate call release procedures. 
      
     - Upon call release completion all resources associated with the call 
     shall become available for access for new requests. 
      
     - The management plane shall be able to release calls or connections 
     established by the control plane both gracefully and forcibly on 
     demand. 
      
     - Partially deleted calls or connections shall not remain within the 
     network. 
      
     - End-to-end acknowledgments shall be used for connection deletion 
     requests. 
      
     - Connection deletion shall not result in either restoration or 
     protection being initiated. 
      
     - The control plane shall support management plane and neighboring 
 
     draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-04.txt            [page 19] 
 
                                    
                                    
      Y. Xue et al 
                                    
     device requests for status query. 
      
     - The UNI shall support initial registration and updates of the UNI-C 
     with the network via the control plane. 
      
     6.4.  Optical Connection granularity 
      
     The service granularity is determined by the specific technology, 
     framing and bit rate of the physical interface between the ONE and 
     the client at the edge and by the capabilities of the ONE. The 
     control plane needs to support signaling and routing for all the 
     services supported by the ONE. In general, there should not be a one- 
     to-one correspondence imposed between the granularity of the service 
     provided and the maximum capacity of the interface to the user. 
      
     The control plane shall support the ITU Rec. G.709 connection 
     granularity for the OTN network. 
      
     The control plane shall support the SDH/SONET connection granularity. 
      
     The optical control plane shall support sub-rate interfaces 
     such as VT /TU granularity (as low as 1.5 Mb/s). 
      
     The following fiber channel interfaces shall be supported by the 
     control plane if the given interfaces are available on the equipment: 
      
     - FC-12 
     - FC-50 
     - FC-100 
     - FC-200 
      
     Encoding of service types in the protocols used shall be such that 
     new service types can be added by adding new code point values or 
     objects. 
      
     6.5.  Other Service Parameters and Requirements 
      
     6.5.1. Classes of Service 
      
     We use "service level" to describe priority related characteristics 
     of connections, such as holding priority, set-up priority, or 
     restoration priority. The intent currently is to allow each carrier 
     to define the actual service level in terms of priority, protection, 
     and restoration options. Therefore, individual carriers will 
     determine mapping of individual service levels to a specific set of 
     quality features. 
      
     The control plane shall be capable of mapping individual service 
     classes into specific priority or protection and restoration options. 
      
     6.5.2.  Diverse Routing Attributes 
 
     draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-04.txt            [page 20] 
 
                                    
                                    
      Y. Xue et al 
                                    
      
     Diversity refers to the fact that a disjoint set of network resources (links and 
     nodes) is utilized to provision multiple parallel optical connections terminated 
     between a pair of ingress and egress ports.  There are different levels of 
     diversity based on link, node or administrative policy as described below. In 
     the simple node and link diversity case: 
       . Two optical connections are said to be node-disjoint diverse, if the two 
          connections do not share any node along the path except the ingress and 
          egress nodes. 
       . Two optical connections are said to be link-disjoint diverse, if the two 
          connections do not share any link along the path. 
      
     A more general concept of diversity is the Shared Risk Group (SRG) that is based 
     on a risk-sharing model and allows the definition of administrative policy-based 
     diversity.  A SRG is defined as a group of links or nodes that share a common 
     risk component, whose failure can potentially cause the failure of all the links 
     or nodes in the group. When the SRG is applied to the link resource, it is 
     referred to as shared risk link group (SRLG). For example, all fiber links that 
     go through a common conduit under the ground belong to the same SRLG group, 
     because the conduit is a shared risk component whose failure, such as a cut, may 
     cause all fibers in the conduit to break. Note that SRLG is a relation defined 
     within a group of links based upon a specific risk factor that can be defined 
     based on various technical or administrative grounds such as Êsharing a 
     conduit∆, Êwithin 10 miles of distance proximity∆ etc.  Please see ITU-T G.7715 
     for more discussion [itu-rtg]. 
      
     Therefore, two optical connections are said to be SRG-disjoint diverse if the 
     two connections do not have any links or nodes that belong to the same SRG along 
     the path. 
      
     The ability to route service paths diversely is a required control 
     feature. Diverse routing is one of the connection parameters and is 
     specified at the time of the connection creation.  
      
     The control plane routing algorithms shall be able to route an optical 
     connection diversely from a previously routed connection in terms of link 
     disjoint path, node disjoint path and SRG disjoint path. 
 
     7.  Optical Service Provider Requirements 
      
     This section discusses specific service control and management 
     requirements from the service provider's point of view. 
      
     7.1.  Service Access Methods to Optical Networks 
      
     In order to have access to the optical network service, a customer needs to be 
     physically connected to the service provider network on the transport plane. The 
     control plane connection may or may not be required depending upon the service 
     invocation model provided to the customer: provisioned vs. signaled. For the 
     signaled, either direct or indirect signaling methods can be used depending upon 
 
     draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-04.txt            [page 21] 
 
                                    
                                    
      Y. Xue et al 
                                    
     if the UNI proxy is utilized on the client side. The detailed discussion on the 
     UNI signaling methods is in [oif-uni]. 
      
     Multiple access methods blow shall be supported: 
      
     - Cross-office access (CNE co-located with ONE) 
      
     - Direct remote access (Dedicated links to the user) 
      
     - Remote access via access sub-network (via a 
     multiplexing/distribution sub-network) 
      
     7.2.  Dual Homing and Network Interconnections 
      
     Dual homing is a special case of the access network. Client devices 
     can be dual homed to the same or different hub, the same or different 
     access network, the same or different core networks, the same or 
     different carriers.  The different levels of dual homing connectivity 
     result in many different combinations of configurations. The main 
     objective for dual homing is for enhanced survivability. 
      
     Dual homing must be supported. Dual homing shall not require the use 
     of multiple addresses for the same client device. 
      
     7.3.  Inter-domain connectivity 
      
     A domain is a portion of a network, or an entire network that is 
     controlled by a single control plane entity.  This section discusses 
     the various requirements for connecting domains. 
      
     7.3.1.  Multi-Level Hierarchy 
      
     Traditionally current transport networks are divided into core inter- 
     city long haul networks, regional intra-city metro networks and 
     access networks. Due to the differences in transmission technologies, 
     service, and multiplexing needs, the three types of networks are 
     served by different types of network elements and often have 
     different capabilities.  The network hierarchy is usually implemented through 
     the control domain hierarchy. 
      
     When control domains exists for routing and signaling purpose, there will be 
     intra-domain routing/signaling and inter-domain routing/signaling. In general, 
     domain-based routing/signaling autonomy is desired and the intra-domain 
     routing/signaling and the inter-domain routing/signaling should be agnostic to 
     each other.  
      
     Routing and signaling for multi-level hierarchies shall be supported 
     to allow carriers to configure their networks as needed. 
      
      
     7.3.2.  Network Interconnections 
 
     draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-04.txt            [page 22] 
 
                                    
                                    
      Y. Xue et al 
                                    
      
     Sub-networks may have multiple points of inter-connections. All 
     relevant NNI functions, such as routing, reachability information 
     exchanges, and inter-connection topology discovery must recognize and 
     support multiple points of inter-connections between subnetworks. 
     Dual inter-connection is often used as a survivable architecture. 
      
     The control plane shall provide support for routing and signaling for 
     subnetworks having multiple points of interconnection. 
      
     7.4.  Names and Address Management 
      
     7.4.1.  Address Space Separation 
      
     To ensure the scalability of and smooth migration toward to the 
     optical switched network, the separation of three address spaces are 
     required as discussed in [oif-addr]: 
      
     - Internal transport network addresses: This is used for routing 
     control plane messages within the transport network. For example,  
     if GMPLS is used then IP address should be used. 
      
     - Transport Network Assigned (TNA) address: This is a routable 
     address in the optical transport network and is assigned by the  
     network. 
      
     - Client addresses: This address has significance in the client layer. 
     For example, if the clients are ATM switches, the NSAP address can be used.  
     If the clients are IP router, then IP address should be used. 
      
     7.4.2.  Directory Services 
      
     Directory Services shall support address resolution and translation 
     between various user/client device names or address and the corresponding TNA 
     addresses.  UNI shall use the user naming schemes for connection request. The 
     directory service is essential for the implementation of overlay model. 
      
     7.4.3.  Network element Identification 
      
     Each control domain and each network element within a carrier network shall be 
     uniquely identifiable. Similarly all the service access points shall be uniquely 
     identifiable. 
      
     7.5.  Policy-Based Service Management Framework 
      
     The optical service must be supported by a robust policy-based management 
     system to be able to make important decisions. 
      
     Examples of policy decisions include: 
     - What types of connections can be set up for a given UNI? 
      
 
     draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-04.txt            [page 23] 
 
                                    
                                    
      Y. Xue et al 
                                    
     - What information can be shared and what information must be 
     restricted in automatic discovery functions? 
      
     - What are the security policies over signaling interfaces? 
      
     - What routing policies should be applied in the path selection? E.g 
     The definition of the link diversity. 
      
     Requirements: 
     - Service and network policies related to configuration and 
     provisioning, admission control, and support of Service Level 
     Agreements (SLAs) must be flexible, and at the same time simple and 
     scalable. 
      
     - The policy-based management framework must be based on standards- 
     based policy systems (e.g., IETF COPS [rfc2784]). 
      
     - In addition, the IPO service management system must support and be 
     backwards compatible with legacy service management systems. 
      
     8.  Control Plane Functional Requirements for Optical Services 
      
     This section addresses the requirements for the optical control plane 
     in support of service provisioning. 
      
     The scope of the control plane include the control of the interfaces 
     and network resources within an optical network and the interfaces 
     between the optical network and its client networks. In other words, 
     it should include both NNI and UNI aspects. 
      
     8.1.  Control Plane Capabilities and Functions 
      
     The control capabilities are supported by the underlying control 
     functions and protocols built in the control plane. 
      
     8.1.1.  Network Control Capabilities 
      
     The following capabilities are required in the network control plane 
     to successfully deliver automated provisioning for optical services: 
     - Network resource discovery 
      
     - Address assignment and resolution 
      
     - Routing information propagation and dissemination 
      
     - Path calculation and selection 
      
     - Connection management 
      
     These capabilities may be supported by a combination of functions 
     across the control and the management planes. 
 
     draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-04.txt            [page 24] 
 
                                    
                                    
      Y. Xue et al 
                                    
      
     8.1.2.  Control Plane Functions for Network Control 
      
     The following are essential functions needed to support network 
     control capabilities: 
      
     - Signaling 
     - Routing 
     - Automatic resource, service and neighbor discovery 
      
     Specific requirements for signaling, routing and discovery are 
     addressed in Section 9. 
      
     The general requirements for the control plane functions to support 
     optical networking and service functions include: 
      
     - The control plane must have the capability to establish, teardown 
     and maintain the end-to-end connection, and the hop-by-hop connection 
     segments between any two end-points. 
      
     - The control plane must have the capability to support optical traffic- 
     engineering (e.g. wavelength management) requirements including resource 
     discovery and dissemination, constraint-based routing and path computation. 
      
     - The control plane shall support network status or action result 
     code responses to any requests over the control interfaces. 
      
     - The control plane shall support call admission control on UNI and 
     connection-admission control on NNI. 
      
     - The control plane shall support graceful release of network 
     resources associated with the connection after a successful 
     connection teardown or failed connection. 
      
     - The control plane shall support management plane request for 
     connection attributes/status query. 
      
     - The control plane must have the capability to support various 
     protection and restoration schemes. 
      
     - Control plane failures shall not affect active connections and 
     shall not adversely impact the transport and data planes. 
      
     - The control plane should support separation of control function 
     entities including routing, signaling and discovery and should allow 
     different control distributions of those functionalities, including 
     centralized, distributed or hybrid. 
      
     - The control plane should support physical separation of the control 
     plane from the transport plane to support either tightly coupled or 
     loosely coupled control plane solutions. 
 
     draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-04.txt            [page 25] 
 
                                    
                                    
      Y. Xue et al 
                                    
      
     - The control plane should support the routing and signaling proxy to 
     participate in the normal routing and signaling message exchange and 
     processing. 
      
     - Security and resilience are crucial issues for the control plane 
     and will be addressed in Section 10 and 11 of this document. 
      
     8.2.  Signaling Communication Network (SCN) 
      
     The signaling communication network is a transport network for 
     control plane messages and it consists of a set of control channels 
     that interconnects the nodes within the control plane. Therefore, the 
     signaling communication network must be accessible by each of the 
     communicating nodes (e.g., OXCs). If an out-of-band IP-based control 
     message transport network is an overlay network built on top of the  
     IP data network using some tunneling technologies, these tunnels must 
     be standards-based such as IPSec, GRE, etc. 
      
     - The signaling communication network must terminate at each of the 
     nodes in the transport plane. 
      
     - The signaling communication network shall not be assumed to have 
     the same topology as the data plane, nor shall the data plane and 
     control plane traffic be assumed to be congruently routed. 
      
     A control channel is the communication path for transporting control 
     messages between network nodes, and over the UNI (i.e., between the 
     UNI entity on the user side (UNI-C) and the UNI entity on the network 
     side (UNI-N)). The control messages include signaling messages, 
     routing information messages, and other control maintenance protocol 
     messages such as neighbor and service discovery. 
      
     The following three types of signaling in the control channel shall 
     be supported: 
      
     - In-band signaling: The signaling messages are carried over a 
     logical communication channel embedded in the data-carrying optical 
     link or channel. For example, using the overhead bytes in SONET data 
     framing as a logical communication channel falls into the in-band 
     signaling methods. 
      
     - In fiber, Out-of-band signaling: The signaling messages are carried 
     over a dedicated communication channel separate from the optical 
     data-bearing channels, but within the same fiber. For example, a 
     dedicated wavelength or TDM channel may be used within the same fiber 
     as the data channels. 
      
     - Out-of-fiber signaling: The signaling messages are carried over a 
     dedicated communication channel or path within different fibers to 
     those used by the optical data-bearing channels. For example, 
 
     draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-04.txt            [page 26] 
 
                                    
                                    
      Y. Xue et al 
                                    
     dedicated optical fiber links or communication path via separate and 
     independent IP-based network infrastructure are both classified as 
     out-of-fiber signaling. 
      
     The UNI control channel and proxy signaling defined in the OIF UNI 
     1.0 [oif-uni] shall be supported. 
      
     The signaling communication network provides communication 
     mechanisms between entities in the control plane. 
      
     - The signaling communication network shall support reliable 
     message transfer. 
      
     - The signaling communication network shall have its own OAM mechanisms. 
      
     - The signaling communication network shall use protocols that 
     support congestion control mechanisms. 
      
     In addition, the signaling communication network should support 
     message priorities. Message prioritization allows time critical 
     messages, such as those used for restoration, to have priority over 
     other messages, such as other connection signaling messages and 
     topology and resource discovery messages. 
      
     The signaling communication network shall be highly reliable and 
     implement failure recovery. 
      
     8.3  Control Plane Interface to Data Plane 
 
     In the situation where the control plane and data plane are decoupled, this 
     interface needs to be standardized. 
     Requirements for a standard control-data plane interface are under 
     study. The specification of a control plane interface to the data 
     plane is outside the scope of this document. 
      
     Control plane should support a standards based interface to configure 
     switching fabrics and port functions via the management plane. 
      
     Data plane shall monitor and detect the failure (LOL, LOS, etc.) and 
     quality degradation (high BER, etc.) of the signals and be able to 
     provide signal-failure and signal-degrade alarms to the control plane 
     accordingly to trigger proper mitigation actions in the control 
     plane. 
      
     8.4.  Management Plane Interface to Data Plane 
      
     The management plane shall be responsible for the network resource 
     management in the data plane. It should able to partition the network 
     resources and control the allocation and the deallocation of the 
     resource for the use by the control plane. 
      
 
     draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-04.txt            [page 27] 
 
                                    
                                    
      Y. Xue et al 
                                    
     Data plane shall monitor and detect the failure and quality 
     degradation of the signals and be able to provide signal-failure and 
     signal-degrade alarms plus associated detailed fault information to 
     the management plane to trigger and enable the management for fault 
     location and repair. 
      
     Management plane failures shall not affect the normal operation of a 
     configured and operational control plane or data plane. 
      
     8.5.  Control Plane Interface to Management Plane 
      
     The control plane is considered a managed entity within a network. 
     Therefore, it is subject to management requirements just as other 
     managed entities in the network are subject to such requirements. 
      
     Control plane should be able to service the requests from the 
     management plane for end-to-end connection provisioning (e.g. SPC 
     connection) and control plane database information query (e.g. 
     topology database) 
      
     Control plane shall report all the control plane faults to the 
     management plane with detailed fault information 
      
     The control, management and transport plane each has its well-defined network 
     functions. Those functions are orthogonal to each other. However, this does not 
     total independency. Since the management plane is responsible for the management 
     of both control plane and transport plane, the management plane plays an 
     authoritative role 
      
     In general, the management plane shall have authority over the 
     control plane. Management plane should be able to configure the 
     routing, signaling and discovery control parameters such as hold-down 
     timers, hello-interval, etc. to affect the behavior of the control 
     plane.  
      
     In the case of network failure, both the management plane and 
     the control plane need fault information at the same priority. The 
     control plane shall be responsible for providing necessary statistic 
     data such as call counts, traffic counts to the management plane. 
     They should be available upon the query from the management plane. 
     The management plane shall be able to tear down connections 
     established by the control plane both gracefully and forcibly on 
     demand. 
      
      
     8.6.  IP and Optical Control Plane Interconnection 
      
     The control plane interconnection model defines how two 
     control networks can be interconnected in terms of controlling 
     relationship and control information flow allowed between them. 
     There are three basic types of control plane network interconnection 
 
     draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-04.txt            [page 28] 
 
                                    
                                    
      Y. Xue et al 
                                    
     models: overlay, peer and hybrid, which are defined in the IETF IPO 
     WG document [ipo_frame]. See Appendix A for more discussion. 
      
     Choosing the level of coupling depends upon a number of different 
     factors, some of which are: 
      
     - Variety of clients using the optical network 
      
     - Relationship between the client and optical network 
      
     - Operating model of the carrier 
      
     Overlay model (UNI like model) shall be supported for client to 
     optical control plane interconnection. 
      
     Other models are optional for client to optical control plane 
     interconnection. 
      
     For optical to optical control plane interconnection all three models 
     shall be supported. In general, the priority for support of 
     interconnection models should be overlay, hybrid and peer, in 
     decreasing order. 
      
     9.  Requirements for Signaling, Routing and Discovery 
      
     9.1.  Requirements for information sharing over UNI, I-NNI and E-NNI 
      
     Different types of interfaces shall impose different requirements and 
     functionality due to their different trust relationships. 
     Specifically: 
      
     -  Topology information shall not be exchanged across inter-carrier E-NNI and 
     UNI. 
      
     -  The control plane shall allow the carrier to configure the type 
     and extent of control information exchange across various interfaces. 
      
     -  Address resolution exchange over UNI is needed if an addressing 
     directory service is not available. 
      
     9.2.  Signaling Functions 
      
     Call and connection control and management signaling messages are 
     used for the establishment, modification, status query and release of 
     an end-to-end optical connection.  Unless otherwise specified, the 
     word "signaling" refers to both inter-domain and intra-domain 
     signaling. 
      
     - The inter-domain signaling protocol shall be agnostic to the intra- 
     domain signaling protocol for all the domains within the network. 
      
 
     draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-04.txt            [page 29] 
 
                                    
                                    
      Y. Xue et al 
                                    
     - Signaling shall support both strict and loose routing. 
      
     - Signaling shall support individual as well as groups of connection 
     requests. 
      
     - Signaling shall support fault notifications. 
      
     - Inter-domain signaling shall support per connection, globally 
     unique identifiers for all connection management primitives based on 
     a well-defined naming scheme. 
      
     - Inter-domain signaling shall support crank-back and rerouting. 
      
     9.3.  Routing Functions 
      
     Routing includes reachability information propagation, network 
     topology/resource information dissemination and path computation. 
     Network topology/resource information dissemination is to provide 
     each node in the network with information about the carrier network 
     such that a single node is able to support constraint-based path 
     selection.  A mixture of hop-by-hop routing, explicit/source routing 
     and hierarchical routing will likely be used within future transport 
     networks. 
      
     All three mechanisms (Hop-by-hop routing, explicit / source-based 
     routing and hierarchical routing) must be supported.  Messages 
     crossing untrusted boundaries must not contain information regarding 
     the details of an internal network topology. 
      
     Requirements for routing information dissemination: 
      
     - The inter-domain routing protocol shall be agnostic to the intra- 
     domain routing protocol within any of the domains within the network. 
      
     - The exchange of the following types of information shall be 
     supported by inter-domain routing protocols: 
          - Inter-domain topology 
          - Per-domain topology abstraction 
          - Per domain reachability summarization 
      
     Major concerns for routing protocol performance are scalability and 
     stability, which impose the following requirement on the routing 
     protocols: 
      
     - The routing protocol shall scale with the size of the network 
      
     The routing protocols shall support following requirements: 
      
     - Routing protocol shall support hierarchical routing information 
     dissemination, including topology information aggregation and 
     summarization. 
 
     draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-04.txt            [page 30] 
 
                                    
                                    
      Y. Xue et al 
                                    
      
     - The routing protocol(s) shall minimize global information and keep 
     information locally significant as much as possible. 
     Over external interfaces only reachability information, next 
     routing hop and service capability information should be exchanged.  
     Any other network related information shall not leak out to other  
     networks. 
      
     - The routing protocol shall be able to minimize global information 
     and keep information locally significant as much as possible (e.g., 
     information local to a node, a sub-network, a domain, etc). For 
     example, a single optical node may have thousands of ports. The ports 
     with common characteristics need not to be advertised individually. 
      
     - The routing protocol shall distinguish static routing information 
     and dynamic routing information. The routing protocol operation shall 
     update dynamic and static routing information differently. Only  
     dynamic 
     routing information shall be updated in real time. 
      
     - Routing protocol shall be able to control the dynamic information 
     updating frequency through different types of thresholds. Two types 
     of thresholds could be defined: absolute threshold and relative 
     threshold. 
      
     - The routing protocol shall support trigger-based and timeout-based 
     information update. 
      
     - Inter-domain routing protocol shall support policy-based routing 
     information exchange. 
      
     - The routing protocol shall be able to support different levels of 
     protection/restoration and other resiliency requirements. These are  
     discussed in Section 10. 
      
     All the scalability techniques will impact the network resource 
     representation accuracy. The tradeoff between accuracy of the routing 
     information and the routing protocol scalability is an important 
     consideration to be made by network operators. 
      
     9.4.  Requirements for path selection 
      
      The following are functional requirements for path selection: 
      
     - Path selection shall support shortest path routing. 
      
     - Path selection shall also support constraint-based routing.  At 
     least the following constraints shall be supported: 
       - Cost 
       - Link utilization 
       - Diversity

      Y. Xue et al 
                                    
       - Service Class 
      
     - Path selection shall be able to include/exclude some specific 
     network resources, based on policy. 
      
     - Path selection shall be able to support different levels of 
     diversity, including node, link, SRLG and SRG. 
      
     - Path selection algorithms shall provide carriers the ability to 
     support a wide range of services and multiple levels of service 
     classes. Parameters such as service type, transparency, bandwidth, 
     latency, bit error rate, etc. may be relevant. 
      
     Constraint-based routing in the optical network in significantly complex 
     Compared to the IP network. There are many optical layer constraints to consider 
     such as wavelength, diversity, optical layer impairments, etc.  A detailed 
     discussion on the routing constraints at the optical layer is in [ietf-olr]. 
      
     9.5.  Discovery Functions 
     The discovery functions include neighbor, resource and service 
     discovery. The control plane shall support both manual configuration and 
     automatic discovery 
      
     9.5.1.  Neighbor discovery 
     Neighbor Discovery can be described as an instance of auto-discovery 
     that is used for associating two network entities within a layer 
     network based on a specified adjacency relation. 
      
     The control plane shall support the following neighbor discovery 
     capabilities as described in [itu-disc]: 
      
     - Physical media adjacency that detects and verifies the physical 
     layer network connectivity between two connected network element 
     ports. 
      
     - Logical network adjacency that detects and verify the logical 
     network layer connection above the physical layer between network 
     layer specific ports. 
      
     - Control adjacency that detect and verify the logical neighboring 
     relation between two control entities associated with data plane 
     network elements that form either physical or logical adjacency. 
      
      The control plane shall support manual neighbor adjacency 
     configuration to either overwrite or supplement the automatic 
     neighbor discovery function. 
      
     9.5.2. Resource Discovery 
      
     Resource discovery is concerned with the ability to verify physical 
     connectivity between two ports on adjacent network elements, improve 
 
     draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-04.txt            [page 32] 
 
                                    
                                    
      Y. Xue et al 
                                    
     inventory management of network resources, detect configuration 
     mismatches between adjacent ports, associating port characteristics 
     of adjacent network elements, etc. Resource discovery shall be 
     supported. 
      
     Resource discovery can be achieved through either manual provisioning 
     or automated procedures. The procedures are generic while the 
     specific mechanisms and control information can be technology 
     dependent. 
      
     After neighbor discovery, resource verification and monitoring must be 
     performed periodically to verify physical attributes to ensure 
     compatibility. 
      
     9.5.3. Service Discovery 
      
     Service Discovery can be described as an instance of auto-discovery 
     that is used for verifying and exchanging service capabilities of a 
     network. Service discovery can only happen after neighbor discovery. 
     Since service capabilities of a network can dynamically change, 
     service discovery may need to be repeated. 
      
     Service discovery is required for all the optical services supported. 
      
     10.  Requirements for service and control plane resiliency 
      
     Resiliency is a network capability to continue its operations under 
     the condition of failures within the network.  The automatic switched 
     optical network assumes the separation of control plane and data 
     plane. Therefore the failures in the network can be divided into 
     those affecting the data plane and those affecting the control plane. 
     To provide enhanced optical services, resiliency measures in both 
     data plane and control plane should be implemented. The following 
     Failure-handling principles shall be supported. 
      
     The control plane shall provide optical service failure detection and 
     recovery functions such that the failures in the data plane within 
     the control plane coverage can be quickly mitigated. 
      
     The failure of control plane shall not in any way adversely affect 
     the normal functioning of existing optical connections in the data 
     plane. 
      
     In general, there shall be no single point of failure for all major 
     control plane functions, including signaling, routing etc. The 
     control plane shall provide reliable transfer of signaling messages 
     and flow control mechanisms for easing any congestion within the 
     control plane. 
      
     10.1.  Service resiliency 
      
 
     draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-04.txt            [page 33] 
 
                                    
                                    
      Y. Xue et al 
                                    
     In circuit-switched transport networks, the quality and reliability 
     of the established optical connections in the transport plane can be 
     enhanced by the protection and restoration mechanisms provided by the 
     control plane functions.  Rapid recovery is required by transport 
     network providers to protect service and also to support stringent 
     Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that dictate high reliability and 
     availability for customer connectivity. 
      
     Protection and restoration are closely related techniques for 
     repairing network node and link failures. Protection is a collection 
     of failure recovery techniques meant to rehabilitate failed 
     connections by pre-provisioning dedicated protection network 
     connections and switching to the protection circuit once the failure 
     is detected.  Restoration is a collection of reactive techniques used 
     to rehabilitate failed connections by dynamic rerouting the failed 
     connection around the network failures using the shared network 
     resources. 
      
     The protection switching is characterized by shorter recovery time at 
     the cost of the dedicated network resources while dynamic restoration 
     is characterized by longer recover time with efficient resource 
     sharing.  Furthermore, the protection and restoration can be 
     performed either on a per link/span basis or on an end-to-end 
     connection path basis. The former is called local repair initiated a 
     node closest to the failure and the latter is called global repair 
     initiated from the ingress node. 
      
     The protection and restoration actions are usually in reaction to the 
     failure in the networks. However, during the network maintenance 
     affecting the protected connections, a network operator needs to 
     proactively force the traffic on the protected connections to switch 
     to its protection connection. 
      
     The failure and signal degradation in the transport plane is usually 
     technology specific and therefore shall be monitored and detected by 
     the transport plane. 
      
     The transport plane shall report both physical level failure and 
     signal degradation to the control plane in the form of the signal 
     failure alarm and signal degrade alarm. 
      
     The control plane shall support both alarm-triggered and hold-down 
     timers based protection switching and dynamic restoration for failure 
     recovery. 
      
     Clients will have different requirements for connection availability. 
     These requirements can be expressed in terms of the "service level", 
     which can be mapped to different restoration and protection options 
     and priority related connection characteristics, such as holding 
     priority(e.g. pre-emptable or not), set-up priority, or restoration 
     priority. However, how the mapping of individual service levels to a 
 
     draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-04.txt            [page 34] 
 
                                    
                                    
      Y. Xue et al 
                                    
     specific set of protection/restoration options and connection 
     priorities will be determined by individual carriers. 
      
     In order for the network to support multiple grades of service, the 
     control plane must support differing protection and restoration 
     options on a per connection basis. 
      
     In order for the network to support multiple grades of service, the 
     control plane must support setup priority, restoration priority and 
     holding priority on a per connection basis. 
      
     In general, the following protection schemes shall be considered for 
     all protection cases within the network: 
     - Dedicated protection: 1+1 and 1:1 
     - Shared protection: 1:N and M:N. 
     - Unprotected 
      
     The control plane shall support "extra-traffic" capability, which 
     allows unprotected traffic to be transmitted on the protection 
     circuit. 
      
     The control plane shall support both trunk-side and drop-side 
     protection switching. 
      
     The following restoration schemes should be supported: 
     - Restorable 
     - Un-restorable 
      
     Protection and restoration can be done on an end-to-end basis per 
     connection. It can also be done on a per span or link basis between 
     two adjacent network nodes. These schemes should be supported. 
      
     The protection and restoration actions are usually triggered by the 
     failure in the networks. However, during the network maintenance 
     affecting the protected connections, a network operator need to 
     proactively force the traffic on the protected connections to switch 
     to its protection connection. Therefore in order to support easy 
     network maintenance, it is required that management initiated 
     protection and restoration be supported. 
      
     Protection and restoration configuration should be based on software 
     only. 
      
     The control plane shall allow the modification of protection and 
     restoration attributes on a per-connection basis. 
      
     The control plane shall support mechanisms for reserving bandwidth 
     resources for restoration. 
      
     The control plane shall support mechanisms for normalizing connection 
     routing (reversion) after failure repair.

      Y. Xue et al 
                                    
      
     Normal connection management operations (e.g., connection deletion) 
     shall not result in protection/restoration being initiated. 
      
     10.2.  Control plane resiliency 
      
     The control plane may be affected by failures in signaling network 
     connectivity and by software failures (e.g., signaling, topology and 
     resource discovery modules). 
      
     The signaling control plane should implement signaling message 
     priorities to ensure that restoration messages receive preferential 
     treatment, resulting in faster restoration. 
      
     The optical control plane signal network shall support protection and 
     restoration options to enable it to self-healing in case of failures 
     within the control plane. 
      
     Control network failure detection mechanisms shall distinguish 
     between control channel and software process failures. 
      
     The control plane failure shall only impact the capability to 
     provision new services. 
      
     Fault localization techniques for the isolation of failed control 
     resources shall be supported. 
      
     Recovery from control plane failures shall result in complete 
     recovery and re-synchronization of the network. 
      
     There shall not be a signal point of failure in the control plane systems 
     design. 
      
     Partial or total failure of the control plane shall not affect the existing 
     established connections. It should only lose the capability to accept the new 
     connection requests. 
      
     11.  Security Considerations 
      
     In this section, security considerations and requirements for optical 
     services and associated control plane requirements are described. 
      
      
     11.1.  Optical Network Security Concerns 
      
     Since optical service is directly related to the physical network 
     which is fundamental to a telecommunications infrastructure, 
     stringent security assurance mechanism should be implemented in 
     optical networks. 
      
     In terms of security, an optical connection consists of two aspects. 
 
     draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-04.txt            [page 36] 
 
                                    
                                    
      Y. Xue et al 
                                    
     One is security of the data plane where an optical connection itself 
     belongs, and the other is security of the control plane. 
      
     11.1.1.  Data Plane Security 
      
     - Misconnection shall be avoided in order to keep the user's data 
     confidential.  For enhancing integrity and confidentiality of data, 
     it may be helpful to support scrambling of data at layer 2 or 
     encryption of data at a higher layer. 
      
      
     11.1.2.  Control Plane Security 
      
     It is desirable to decouple the control plane from the data plane 
     physically. 
      
     Restoration shall not result in miss-connections (connections 
     established to a destination other than that intended), even for 
     short periods of time (e.g., during contention resolution). For 
     example, signaling messages, used to restore connectivity after 
     failure, should not be forwarded by a node before contention has been 
     resolved. 
      
     Additional security mechanisms should be provided to guard against 
     intrusions on the signaling network. Some of these may be done with 
     the help of the management plane. 
      
     - Network information shall not be advertised across external 
     interfaces (UNI or E-NNI). The advertisement of network information 
     across the E-NNI shall be controlled and limited in a configurable 
     policy based fashion. The advertisement of network information shall 
     be isolated and managed separately by each administration. 
      
     - The signaling network itself shall be secure, blocking all 
     unauthorized access.  The signaling network topology and addresses 
     shall not be advertised outside a carrier's domain of trust. 
      
     - Identification, authentication and access control shall be 
     rigorously used by network operators for providing access to the 
     control plane. 
      
     - Discovery information, including neighbor discovery, service 
     discovery, resource discovery and reachability information should be 
     exchanged in a secure way. 
      
     - Information on security-relevant events occurring in the control 
     plane or security-relevant operations performed or attempted in the 
     control plane shall be logged in the management plane. 
      
     - The management plane shall be able to analyze and exploit logged 
     data in order to check if they violate or threat security of the 
 
     draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-04.txt            [page 37] 
 
                                    
                                    
      Y. Xue et al 
                                    
     control plane. 
      
     - The control plane shall be able to generate alarm notifications 
     about security related events to the management plane in an 
     adjustable and selectable fashion. 
      
     - The control plane shall support recovery from successful and 
     attempted intrusion attacks. 
      
     11.2.  Service Access Control 
      
     From a security perspective, network resources should be protected 
     from unauthorized accesses and should not be used by unauthorized 
     entities. Service access control is the mechanism that limits and 
     controls entities trying to access network resources. Especially on 
     the UNI and E-NNI, Connection Admission Control (CAC) functions 
     should also support the following security features: 
      
     - CAC should be applied to any entity that tries to access network 
     resources through the UNI (or E-NNI). CAC should include an 
     authentication function of an entity in order to prevent masquerade 
     (spoofing). Masquerade is fraudulent use of network resources by 
     pretending to be a different entity. An authenticated entity should 
     be given a service access level on a configurable policy basis. 
      
     - The UNI and NNI should provide optional mechanisms to ensure origin 
     authentication and message integrity for connection management 
     requests such as set-up, tear-down and modify and connection 
     signaling messages. This is important in order to prevent Denial of 
      
     Service attacks. The UNI and E-NNI should also include mechanisms, 
     such as usage-based billing based on CAC, to ensure non-repudiation 
     of connection management messages. 
      
     - Each entity should be authorized to use network resources according 
     to the administrative policy set by the operator.

     Appendix A: Interconnection of Control Planes 
      
     The interconnection of the IP router (client) and optical control 
     planes can be realized in a number of ways depending on the required 
     level of coupling.  The control planes can be loosely or tightly 
     coupled.  Loose coupling is generally referred to as the overlay 
     model and tight coupling is referred to as the peer model. 
     Additionally there is the augmented model that is somewhat in between 
     the other two models but more akin to the peer model.  The model 
     selected determines the following: 
      
     - The details of the topology, resource and reachability information 
     advertised between the client and optical networks 
      
     - The level of control IP routers can exercise in selecting paths 
     across the optical network 
      
     The next three sections discuss these models in more details and the 
     last section describes the coupling requirements from a carrier's 
     perspective. 
      
      
      Peer Model (I-NNI like model) 
      
     Under the peer model, the IP router clients act as peers of the 
     optical transport network, such that single routing protocol instance 
     runs over both the IP and optical domains.  In this regard the 
     optical network elements are treated just like any other router as 
     far as the control plane is concerned. The peer model, although not 
     strictly an internal NNI, behaves like an I-NNI in the sense that

      Y. Xue et al 
                                    
     there is sharing of resource and topology information. 
      
     Presumably a common IGP such as OSPF or IS-IS, with appropriate 
     extensions, will be used to distribute topology information.  One 
     tacit assumption here is that a common addressing scheme will also be 
     used for the optical and IP networks.  A common address space can be 
     trivially realized by using IP addresses in both IP and optical 
     domains.  Thus, the optical networks elements become IP addressable 
     entities. 
      
     The obvious advantage of the peer model is the seamless 
     interconnection between the client and optical transport networks. 
     The tradeoff is that the tight integration and the optical specific 
     routing information that must be known to the IP clients. 
      
     The discussion above has focused on the client to optical control 
     plane inter-connection.  The discussion applies equally well to 
     inter-connecting two optical control planes. 
      
     Overlay (UNI-like model) 
      
     Under the overlay model, the IP client routing, topology 
     distribution, and signaling protocols are independent of the routing, 
     topology distribution, and signaling protocols at the optical layer. 
     This model is conceptually similar to the classical IP over ATM 
     model, but applied to an optical sub-network directly. 
      
     Though the overlay model dictates that the client and optical network 
     are independent this still allows the optical network to re-use IP 
     layer protocols to perform the routing and signaling functions. 
      
     In addition to the protocols being independent the addressing scheme 
     used between the client and optical network must be independent in 
     the overlay model.  That is, the use of IP layer addressing in the 
     clients must not place any specific requirement upon the addressing 
     used within the optical control plane. 
      
     The overlay model would provide a UNI to the client networks through 
     which the clients could request to add, delete or modify optical 
     connections.  The optical network would additionally provide 
     reachability information to the clients but no topology information 
     would be provided across the UNI. 
      
      
     Augmented model (E-NNI like model) 
      
     Under the augmented model, there are actually separate routing 
     instances in the IP and optical domains, but information from one 
     routing instance is passed through the other routing instance.  For 
     example, external IP addresses could be carried within the optical 
     routing protocols to allow reachability information to be passed to

      Y. Xue et al 
                                    
     IP clients.  A typical implementation would use BGP between the IP 
     client and optical network. 
      
     The augmented model, although not strictly an external NNI, behaves 
     like an E-NNI in that there is limited sharing of information. 
      
     Generally in a carrier environment there will be more than just IP 
     routers connected to the optical network.  Some other examples of 
     clients could be ATM switches or SONET ADM equipment.  This may drive 
     the decision towards loose coupling to prevent undue burdens upon 
     non-IP router clients.  Also, loose coupling would ensure that future 
     clients are not hampered by legacy technologies. 
      
     Additionally, a carrier may for business reasons want a separation 
     between the client and optical networks.  For example, the ISP 
     business unit may not want to be tightly coupled with the optical 
     network business unit.  Another reason for separation might be just 
     pure politics that play out in a large carrier.  That is, it would 
     seem unlikely to force the optical transport network to run that same 
     set of protocols as the IP router networks.  Also, by forcing the 
     same set of protocols in both networks the evolution of the networks 
     is directly tied together.  That is, it would seem you could not 
     upgrade the optical transport network protocols without taking into 
     consideration the impact on the IP router network (and vice versa). 
      
     Operating models also play a role in deciding the level of coupling. 
     [id-freeland] gives four main operating models envisioned for an optical 
     transport network:  
     Category 1: ISP owning all of its own infrastructure (i.e., 
     including fiber and duct to the customer premises) 
      
     Category 2:  ISP leasing some or all of its capacity from a third party 
      
     Category 3:  Carriers carrier providing layer 1 services 
      
     Category 4:  Service provider offering multiple layer 1, 2, and 3 services over 
     a common infrastructure 
      
     Although relatively few, if any, ISPs fall into category 1 it would 
     seem the mostly likely of the four to use the peer model.  The other 
     operating models would lend themselves more likely to choose an 
     overlay model.  Most carriers would fall into category 4 and thus 
     would most likely choose an overlay model architecture.
