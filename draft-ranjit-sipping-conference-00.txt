1. Introduction

This document builds upon the conferencing requirements speified in [4] 
and explains the mechanism to initiate, modify and teardown conference. 
It also describes a mechanism to add,remove and modify one or more
participants To/From the SIP conference.
   
2. Terminology

In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", 
"SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", 
"MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14,
RFC 2119 [1] and indicate requirement levels for compliant 
implementations.

3. Overview of conference mechanism

In a SIP based voice conference the SIP User Agent which wants to 
initiate a conference becomes the Initiator of the conference. The 
Initiator can then add other users into the conference. The initiator
of the conference has some exclusive privileges on the conference 
session.
 - Initiator can add participants to the conference session.
 - Initiator can modify the mode of the existing participants.
 - Initiator can remove the participants from the conference session.  
 - Initiator can close the conference session.

Note: The Initiator maps to focus-owner as defined in [4].

4. Motivation for new Method and Header

The INVITE method of SIP [1] protocol helps in establishing and 
tearing down of voice calls between SIP user agents. Also the SIP
INFO [2] helps in carrying application level information along the 
SIP signaling path during a SIP Session and SIP Method MESSAGE [3]
sends an instant message to remote UA. Neither of these methods do
not fulfill the requirement of conveying SIP Client's intention of
initiating multiparty SIP session. Hence INITIATE method been 
introduced.

Also there is no SIP header through which a list of URIs can be 
provided to the server or to the conference server. So the 
Confer-To header is introduced.

A Method called INITIATE is proposed. The INITIATE method does not 
establish any session nor carries any media information.  It 
conveys the users intention to start the conference session with
the list of participants mentioned in the Confer-To header.

5. The INITIATE Method
  
INITIATE is a SIP method as defined by RFC 3261 [1]. The INITIATE 
method indicates that the initiator (identified by From URL) wants
to initiate a session (Conferencing) with the server. 
   
5.1  Definition of INITIATE Method
   
The semantics of the INITIATE method are described as follows. This
extension adds another value to the Method BNF described in RFC3261[2].

      INITIATEm = %x49.4E.49.54.49.41.54.45; INITIATE in caps
      Method   = INVITEm / ACKm / OPTIONSm / BYEm
                  / CANCELm / REGISTERm / UPDATEm 
                  / INITIATEm / extension-method.
                  
     Table 1 extends Table 2 of RFC 3261 [2] for the INITIATE method.
      
     Table 2 extends Table 3 of RFC 3261 [2] for the INITIATE method.
                  
5.2 Confer-To Header

This header indicates to the Proxy or Conference server the list of
participants, which need to be added to the conference. Only a single
Confer-To header field value SHOULD be present in the INITIATE request.
Along with the participants URI, this header contains an Action
paramater which indicates the action to be taken for the URI. The 
default action paramater will be "ADD".

The Confer-To header follows the Route header syntax defined in
[1] .The Confer-To header specifies the set of users with which the
caller wants to initiate a session.

Header field    where   proxy   INITIATE
------------    -----   -----   --------
Confer-To          R              o

The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
Form (BNF) as described in RFC-2234 [3].

	Confer-To = "Confer-To" HCOLON ConferTo-Param
				* (COMMA ConferTo-Param)
	ConferTo-Param = name-addr *( SEMI confer-to-params )
	confer-to-params = action-param / generic-param
	action-param = "action" EQUAL ("add" / "hold" /  "remove")

 6. Types of Conferences
 
 6.1 User Initiated Conference
 
 Here the user who wants to initiate a conference becomes the initiator
 and sends INITIATE request to the conference server with the list of
 participants in Confer-To header.

 Internet Draft         SIP Conference                        April 2004

   
 The call flow for this scenario is depicted in Figure 6.1
 On receiving INITIATE request, the conference server sends INVITE 
 to all the users listed in the Confer-To header. The server sends 
 notifications as  described in section 3.6 of [5].
 
 On receiving INVITE the UAs (participants) send 200 OK to join the
 conference. The server on receiving 200 OKs from the participants
 sends notification using NOTIFY to the initiator.
 
 For more details on frequency of notifications and how they are sent
 refer sections 3.2 and 3.4 of [5].

    it sends a REFER to the Conference server with Refer-To header 
    containing the URI of the new participant and action parameter 
    with value as æaddÆ.The server then reads the Refer-To header and
    action parameter and if the value is æaddÆ sends INVITE with SDP [2]
    parameter a=sendrecv to indicate that the user to be added The 
    participant upon receiving the INVITE sends 200 OK to join the 
    conference to send and receive the media. The server on receiving 
    the 200 OK, sends NOTIFY to the initiator indicating the joining 
    of new participant.

    In the call flow depicted below, the initiator (UA1) is placing 
    on the participants' UA2 on hold.

7.3 Placing Participant on Hold

    The initiator sends a REFER to the Conference Server with the URI
    of the participant to be kept on hold in the Refer-To header and 
    action=hold. The server then reads the Refer-To header and action
    parameter with value æholdÆ sends INVITE with SDP parameter 
    a='recvonly' to indicate that the user should go on hold  Here the 
    user can only recv (can hear) and cannot send media.
     
    The participant upon receiving the INVITE sends 200 OK to the 
    conference server. The server on receiving the 200 OK, sends NOTIFY
    to the initiator indicating that the participant is on hold
