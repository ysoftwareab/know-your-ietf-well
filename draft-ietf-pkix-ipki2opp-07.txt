2.  Abstract

     The protocol described in this document is designed to satisfy some
     of  the  operational  requirements within the Internet X.509 Public
     Key Infrastructure (IPKI).  Specifically, this  document  addresses
     requirements  to  provide access to Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
     repositories for the purposes of  retrieving  PKI  information  and
     managing  that  same  information.  The mechanism described in this
     document is based on  the  Lightweight  Directory  Access  Protocol
     (LDAP) v2, defined in RFC 1777, defining a profile of that protocol
     for use within the IPKI and updates encodings for certificates  and
     revocation  lists  from  RFC 1778. Additional mechanisms addressing
     PKIX operational requirements are specified in separate documents.

     The key words  "MUST",  "REQUIRED",  "SHOULD",  "RECOMMENDED",  and
     "MAY"  in  this  document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
     2119.

3.  Introduction

     This specification is part of a multi-part standard for development
     of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for the Internet. This specif-
     ication addresses requirements to provide retrieval  of  X.509  PKI
     information,  including  certificates  and  CRLs from a repository.
     This specification also addresses requirements to add,  delete  and
     modify PKI information in a repository. A profile based on the LDAP
     version 2 protocol is provided to satisfy these requirements.

4.  Model

     The PKI components, as defined in PKIX Part 1, which  are  involved
     in PKIX operational protocol interactions include:

        -  End Entities
        -  Certification Authorities (CA)
        -  Repository

     End entities and CAs using LDAPv2, retrieve  PKI  information  from
     the repository using a subset of the LDAPv2 protocol.

     CAs populate the repository with PKI information using a subset  of
     the LDAPv2 protocol.

5.  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)

     The following sections examine the  retrieval  of  PKI  information
     from  a  repository  and management of PKI information in a reposi-
     tory. A profile of the LDAPv2 protocol  is  defined  for  providing
     these services.

     Section 6 satisfies the requirement to retrieve PKI information  (a
     certificate,  CRL, or other information of interest)  from an entry
     in the repository, where  the  retrieving  entity  (either  an  end
     entity  or  a  CA)  has knowledge of the name of the entry. This is
     termed "repository read".

     Section 7 satisfies the same requirement as  6  for  the  situation
     where  the  name  of the entry is not known, but some other related
     information which may optionally be used as a filter against candi-
     date  entries in the repository, is known.  This is termed "reposi-
     tory search".

     Section 8 satisfies the requirement  of  CAs  to  add,  delete  and
     modify  PKI  information  information (a certificate, CRL, or other
     information of interest)in the repository. This is termed  "reposi-
     tory modify".

     The subset of LDAPv2 needed to support each of these  functions  is
     described  below.  Note  that  the  repository search service  is a
     superset of the repository read service  in  terms  of  the  LDAPv2
     functionality needed.

     Note  that all tags are implicit by default in  the  ASN.1  defini-
     tions that follow.

6.  LDAP Repository Read

     To retrieve information from an entry corresponding to the  subject
     or issuer name of a certificate, requires a subset of the following
     three LDAP operations:

       BindRequest (and BindResponse)
       SearchRequest (and SearchResponse)
       UnbindRequest

     The subset of each REQUIRED operation is given below.

6.1.  Bind

6.1.1.  Bind Request

     The full LDAP v2 Bind Request is defined in RFC 1777.

     An application providing a LDAP repository read service MUST imple-
     ment the following subset of this operation:

        BindRequest ::=
          [APPLICATION 0] SEQUENCE {
             version      INTEGER (2),
             name         LDAPDN, -- MUST accept NULL LDAPDN
             simpleauth [0] OCTET STRING  -- MUST accept NULL simple
             }

     An application providing a LDAP repository read service MAY  imple-
     ment other aspects of the BindRequest as well.

     Different services may have different security  requirements.  Some
     services may allow anonymous search, others may require authentica-
     tion. Those services allowing anonymous search may choose  only  to
     allow search based on certain criteria and not others.

     A LDAP repository read  service  SHOULD  implement  some  level  of
     anonymous  search access. A LDAP repository read service MAY imple-
     ment authenticated search access.

6.1.2.  Bind Response

     The full LDAPv2 BindResponse is described in RFC 1777.

     An application providing a LDAP repository read service MUST imple-
     ment  this entire protocol element, though only the following error
     codes may be returned from a Bind operation:

       success                      (0),
       operationsError              (1),
       protocolError                (2),
       authMethodNotSupported       (7),
       noSuchObject                 (32),
       invalidDNSyntax              (34),
       inappropriateAuthentication  (48),
       invalidCredentials           (49),
       busy                         (51),
       unavailable                  (52),
       unwillingToPerform           (53),
       other                        (80)

6.2.  Search

6.2.1.  Search Request

     The full LDAPv2 SearchRequest is defined in RFC 1777.

     An application providing a LDAP repository read service MUST imple-
     ment the following subset of the SearchRequest.

        SearchRequest ::=
          [APPLICATION 3] SEQUENCE {
             baseObject     LDAPDN,
             scope             ENUMERATED {
                               baseObject   (0),
                                          },
             derefAliases   ENUMERATED {
                               neverDerefAliases   (0),
                                       },
             sizeLimit      INTEGER (0),
             timeLimit      INTEGER (0),
             attrsOnly      BOOLEAN, -- FALSE only
             filter         Filter,
             attributes     SEQUENCE OF AttributeType
                                 }

        Filter ::=
          CHOICE {



Boeyen, Howes & Richard                                         [Page 4]


INTERNET DRAFT                                                March 1998


            present        [7] AttributeType, -- "objectclass" only
                   }

     This subset of the LDAPv2 SearchRequest allows  the  LDAPv2  "read"
     operation:  a  base  object  search  with  a filter testing for the
     existence of the objectClass attribute.

     An application providing a LDAP repository read service MAY  imple-
     ment other aspects of the SearchRequest as well.

6.2.2.

     The full LDAPv2 SearchResponse is defined in RFC 1777.

     An application providing a LDAP repository read service over LDAPv2
     MUST implement the full SearchResponse.

     Note that in the case of multivalued attributes such as  userCerti-
     ficate  a SearchResponse containing this attribute will include all
     values, assuming the requester has sufficient  access  permissions.
     The  application/relying  party  may  need to select an appropriate
     value to be used. Also note that retrieval of a certificate from  a
     named  entry  does  not guarantee that the certificate will include
     that same Distinguished Name (DN) and in some cases the subject  DN
     in the certificate may be NULL.

6.3.  Unbind

     The full LDAPv2 UnbindRequest is defined in RFC 1777.

     An application providing a LDAP repository read service MUST imple-
     ment the full UnbindRequest.

7.  LDAP Repository Search

     To search ,using arbitrary criteria, for an entry in  a  repository
     containing  a  certificate,  CRL, or other information of interest,
     requires a subset of the following three LDAP operations:

       BindRequest (and BindResponse)
       SearchRequest (and SearchResponse)
       UnbindRequest

     The subset of each operation REQUIRED is given below.

7.1.  Bind

     The BindRequest and BindResponse subsets needed  are  the  same  as

     those described in Section 6.1.

     The full LDAP v2 Bind Request is defined in RFC 1777.

7.2.  Search

7.2.1.  Search Request

     The full LDAPv2 SearchRequest is defined in RFC 1777.

     An application providing a  LDAP  repository  search  service  MUST
     implement the following subset of the SearchRequest protocol unit.

        SearchRequest ::=
          [APPLICATION 3] SEQUENCE {
             baseObject     LDAPDN,
             scope          ENUMERATED {
                                 baseObject     (0),
                                 singleLevel    (1),
                                 wholeSubtree   (2)
                                       },
             derefAliases   ENUMERATED {
                                 neverDerefAliases     (0),
                                       },
             sizeLimit      INTEGER (0 .. maxInt),
             timeLimit      INTEGER (0 .. maxInt),
             attrsOnly      BOOLEAN,  -- FALSE only
             filter         Filter,
             attributes     SEQUENCE OF AttributeType
                                  }

     All aspects of the SearchRequest MUST be supported, except for  the
     following:

     - Only the neverDerefAliases value of derefAliases needs
       to be supported

     - Only the FALSE value for attrsOnly needs to be supported

     This subset provides a more general  search  capability.  It  is  a
     superset  of the SearchRequest subset defined in Section 6.2.1. The
     elements added to this service are:

     - singleLevel and wholeSubtree scope needs to be supported

     - sizeLimit is included

     - timeLimit is included

INTERNET DRAFT                                                March 1998


8.3.2.  Add Response

     The full LDAPv2 AddResponse is defined in RFC 1777.

     An application providing a  LDAP  repository  modify  service  MUST
     implement the full AddResponse.

8.4.  Delete

     implement the full DelResponse.

8.5.  Unbind

     An application providing a  LDAP  repository  modify  service  MUST

9.  Non-standard attribute value encodings

     When conveyed in LDAP requests and results, attributes  defined  in
     X.500 are to be encoded using string representations defined in RFC
     1778, The String Representation  of  Standard  Attribute  Syntaxes.
     These string encodings were based on the attribute definitions from
     X.500(1988).  Thus, the string representations of the PKI  informa-
     tion  elements are for version 1 certificates and version 1 revoca-
     tion lists.  Since this specification uses version  3  certificates
     and  version 2 revocation lists, as defined in X.509(1997), the RFC
     1778 string encoding of these attributes is inappropriate.

     For this reason, these attributes MUST be encoded  using  a  syntax
     similar  to  the  syntax  "Undefined" from section 2.1 of RFC 1778:
     values of these attributes are encoded as if they  were  values  of
     type  "OCTET  STRING",  with the string value of the encoding being
     the DER-encoding of the value itself.  For example, when writing  a
     userCertificate  to the repository, the CA generates a DER-encoding
     of the certificate and uses that encoding as the value of the user-
     Certificate  attribute  in  the  LDAP  Modify request.This encoding

INTERNET DRAFT                                                March 1998


     style is consistent with the encoding scheme proposed  for  LDAPv3,
     which is now being defined within the IETF.

     Note that certificates and revocation  lists  will  be  transferred
     using  this  mechanism rather than the string encodings in RFC 1778
     and client systems  which  do  not  understand  this  encoding  may
     experience problems with these attributes.

10.  Transport

     An application providing a LDAP repository read service, LDAP repo-
     sitory  search service, or LDAP repository modify service MUST sup-
     port LDAPv2 transport over TCP, as defined in Section  3.1  of  RFC
     1777.

     An application providing a LDAP repository read service, LDAP repo-
     sitory  search  service, or LDAP repository modify service MAY sup-
     port LDAPv2 transport over other reliable transports as well.

11.  Security Considerations

     Since the elements of information which are key to the PKI  service
     (certificates  and CRLs) are both digitally signed pieces of infor-
     mation, additional integrity service is NOT REQUIRED.   As  neither
     information  element  need  be  kept secret and anonymous access to
     such information, for retrieval purposes is  generally  acceptable,
     privacy service is NOT REQUIRED for information retrieval requests.

     CAs have additional requirements,  including  modification  of  PKI
     information.  Simple  authentication  alone  is  not sufficient for
     these purposes. It is  RECOMMENDED  that  some  stronger  means  of
     authentication and/or (if simple authentication is used) some means
     of protecting the privacy of the password  is  used,  (e.g.  accept
     modifications  only  via physically secure networks, use IPsec, use
     SSH or TLS or SSL tunnel). Without such authentication, it is  pos-
     sible  that  a  denial-of-service  attack  could  occur  where  the
     attacker replaces valid certificates with bogus ones.

     For the LDAP repository modify  service,  profiled  in  section  8,
     there  are  some  specific  security considerations with respect to
     access control. These controls apply to a repository which is under
