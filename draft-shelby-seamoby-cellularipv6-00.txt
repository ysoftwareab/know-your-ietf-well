What's Changed


   The following changes have been made to the original protocol
   presented in  <draft-ietf-mobileip-cellularip-00>:

   - Control messages use IPv6 extension headers for control
     information
   - The Authentication Header is used for all authentication [3]
   - IPv6 Stateless Auto configuration for obtaining care-of-address
   - Alternative indirect semi-soft handoff method added (section 4.1.2)

   In addition, the following minor changes have been made:

   - Added definitions for registration request and semi-soft handoffs
   - Mobile hosts are now identified by their IPv6 care-of-address
     (section 3.4)
   - Added active-state-timeout as parameter (section 3.1)
   - Further clarification of paging cache placement (section 2.1)
   - Misc. text corrections



1. Introduction


   Hosts connecting to the Internet via a wireless interface are likely
   to change their point of access frequently.  A mechanism is required
   that ensures that packets addressed to moving hosts are successfully
   delivered with high probability.  A change of access point during
   active data transmission or reception is called a handoff.  During or
   immediately after a handoff, packet losses may occur due to the
   delayed propagation of new location information.  These losses should
   be minimized in order to avoid a degradation of service quality as
   handoff become more frequent.

   This memo specifies Cellular IP for IPv6, a protocol that provides
   mobility and handoff support for frequently moving hosts.  It is
   intended to be used on a local level, for instance in a campus or
   metropolitan area network.  Cellular IP can inter work with Mobile
   IPv6 [1] to support wide area mobility, that is, mobility between
   Cellular IP Networks.

1.1. Applicability


   Cellular IP supports local mobility, that is, mobility inside an
   access network.  To provide global mobility support, Mobile IPv6 [1]
   should be used in conjunction.

   It is designed to support frequently migrating, rarely moving or
   static hosts as well.

   It is assumed that a random access L2 protocol covers the air inter-
   face.  Optional support for non-random access wireless interfaces to
   perform semi-soft handoff is described in 4.1.2.

   Throughout the draft the term Base Station is used exclusively. This
   also refers to the Access Point used in WLAN and WPAN networks.



1.2. New Architectural Entities

   Cellular IP Node
           A Cellular IP Network consists of interconnected Cellular IP
           nodes.  The role of nodes is twofold.  They route IP packets
           inside the Cellular IP Network and communicate with mobile
           hosts via a wireless interface.  Referring to the latter role,
           a Cellular IP node that has a wireless interface is also called
           a Base Station.

   Cellular IP Base Station
           See Cellular IP node.

   Cellular IP Gateway
           A Cellular IP node that is connected to a regular IP network by
           at least one of its interfaces.

   Cellular IP Mobile Host
           A mobile host that implements the Cellular IP protocol.



1.3. Terminology

   Active Mobile Host
           A mobile host is in active state if it is transmitting or
           receiving IP packets.  (Exact definition is given in Section
           3.8.)

   Cellular IP Network Identifier
           A unique identifier assigned to Cellular IP Networks.

   Control packet
           Paging-update, paging-teardown and route-update packet.

   Data packet
           An IP packet that is not a control packet.

   Downlink
           Directed to a mobile host.

   Downlink neighbor
           All neighbors of a Cellular IP node except its Uplink neighbor
           are referred to as Downlink neighbors.

   Idle Mobile Host
           A mobile host is in idle state if it has not recently
           transmitted or received IP packets.  (Exact definition is given
           in Section 3.8.)

   Internet
           A Cellular IP Network provides access to a regular IP network.
           This IP network in this memo is referred to as "Internet", but
           it can also be a corporate intranet, for example.

   Neighbor
           One Cellular IP node is said to be the neighbor of another if
           they are connected directly. Neighbors are identified in a
           Cellular IP node by interface and MAC address.

   Paging Area
           A set of Base Stations. Idle mobile hosts crossing cell
           boundaries within a Paging Area do not need to transmit control
           packets to update their position. (Exact definition is given in
           Section 2.1.)

   Paging Cache
           A cache maintained by some Cellular IP nodes, used to route
           packets to mobile hosts.

   In what follows, we present an overview of the operation of Cellular
   IP, followed by a figure illustrating the functional entities that
   comprise Cellular IP.

   Base Stations periodically emit beacon signals.  Mobile hosts use
   these beacon signals to locate the nearest Base Station.  A mobile
   host can transmit a packet by relaying it to the nearest Base Sta-
   tion.

   By default all IP packets transmitted by a mobile host are routed
   from the Base Station to the Gateway by hop-by-hop shortest path
   routing, regardless of the destination address.

   Cellular IP nodes maintain a Route Cache. Packets transmitted by the
   mobile host create and update entries in each node's Cache.  An entry
   maps the mobile host's IP address to the neighbor from which the
   packet arrived to the node.

   The chain of cached mappings referring to a single mobile host con-
   stitutes a reverse path for downlink packets addressed to the same
   mobile host.  As the mobile host migrates, the chain of mappings
   always points to its current location because its uplink packets
   create new and change old mappings.

   IP packets addressed to a mobile host are routed by the chain of
   cached mappings associated with the said mobile host.

   To prevent its mappings from timing out, a mobile host can periodi-
   cally transmit control packets.  Control packets are IPv6 packets
   with Hop-by-Hop extension headers containing Cellular IP control
   information.

   Mobile hosts that are not actively transmitting data but want to be
   reachable for incoming packets, let their Route Cache mappings time
   out but maintain Paging Cache mappings.  IP packets addressed to
   these mobile hosts will be routed by Paging Caches.  Paging Caches
   have a longer timeout value than Route Caches and are not necessarily
   maintained in every node.

1.5. Location Management and Routing


   Cellular IP uses two parallel cache systems to store the information
   related to the location of mobile hosts.  The two systems basically
   operate in the same way.  This section is intended to clarify why we
   use two distinct caches.

   When a mobile host is in active state, the network must follow its
   movement from Base Station to Base Station to be able to deliver
   packets without searching for the mobile host.  As a consequence
   active mobile hosts must notify the network about each handoff.  For
   idle mobile hosts exact location tracking is less important, instead
   minimizing communication to save battery is of higher priority.  By
   deploying two caches, the granularity of location tracking can be
   different for idle and active mobile hosts.

   Separating the location tracking for idle and active mobile hosts
   also has a performance benefit.  Supposing there is just one set of
   cache, for each downlink packet the entire cache must be searched to
   find the destination mobile host.  It is expected, however, that only
   a portion of the hosts will be in active state at any given time and
   that most of the packets are destined for active mobile hosts.  Thus
   by separating the caches for active and idle mobile hosts only a
   smaller cache needs to be searched for most of the packets.  This
   results in faster lookups and better scalability [5].



2. Cellular IP Functions

2.1. Location Management


   Cellular IP allows idle mobile hosts to roam large geographic areas
   without the need to transmit location update packets at cell borders.
   The network operator can group cells into Paging Areas, each compris-
   ing of an arbitrary number of (typically adjacent) cells.  Each Pag-
   ing Area has an identifier that is unique in the given Cellular IP
   Network.  Each Base Station transmits its Paging Area Identifier in
   its periodic beacon signals, thus enabling mobile hosts to notice
   when they move into a new Paging Area.

   An idle mobile host that moves into a new Paging Area must transmit a
   paging-update packet.  Paging-update packets are routed from the Base
   Station to the Gateway using hop-by-hop routing.  Selected nodes of
   the Cellular IP network are equipped with Paging Cache. These nodes
   monitor passing paging-update packets and update Paging Cache



Shelby, Gatzounas, Campbell, Wan                                [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT               Cellular IPv6                 November 2000


   mappings to point toward the new Paging Area.  Paging-update packets
   reach the Gateway and are discarded there to isolate Cellular IP
   specific operations from the Internet.

   When the idle mobile host moves within a Paging Area, it transmits a
   paging-update packet only when the system specific time, paging-
   update-time expires.  Outdated mappings of Paging Caches are cleared
   if no update arrives before paging-timeout expires.

   When an IP packet arrives at a Cellular IP node, addressed to a
   mobile host for which no up-to-date Route Cache mapping is available,
   the Paging Cache is used to route the packet.  This is called "impli-
   cit paging".  If the node has no Paging Cache, it forwards the packet
   to all Downlink neighbors.  A node that has Paging Cache but has no
   mapping in it for the destination mobile host discards the packet.

   On the path from the gateway to the mobile host there may be Cellular
   IP nodes with and without Paging Cache.  After the paging packet
   leaves the last node which has a Paging Cache it is effectively down-
   link broadcast by all nodes it passes.  The set of cells that are
   reached by the paging packet forms a Paging Area.  The number, size
   and population of Paging Areas in a Cellular IP network are deter-
   mined by the topology of the network and the placement of Paging
   Caches. Each interface of the last downlink node with a paging cache
   must belong to a separate paging area.  Based on the configuration of
   a Paging Area each base station (with Paging Cache configured) could
   be considered an autonomous Paging Area.  The other extreme case is
   when a Cellular IP Network has no Paging Cache configured in which
   case the complete network represents a Paging Area where paging
   devolves to broadcasting throughout the network.

   When the mobile host receives the paging packet, it moves to active
   state and creates its Route Cache mappings by sending a route-update
   packet.  Subsequent IP packets addressed to the same host will be
   routed by Route Caches as long as the mobile host keeps the Route
   Caches updated.



2.2. Routing


   Packets transmitted by mobile hosts are routed to the Gateway using
   shortest path hop-by-hop routing.  Cellular IP nodes monitor these
   passing data packets and use them to create and update Route Cache
   mappings.  These map mobile host IP addresses to Downlink neighbors
   of the Cellular IP node.  Packets addressed to the mobile host are
   routed along the reverse path, on a hop-by-hop basis, by these Route

INTERNET-DRAFT               Cellular IPv6                 November 2000


   Cache mappings.

   The structure and basic operation of routing is similar to that of
   location management.  To clarify the duality between the two, we sum-
   marize the operation of Paging Caches and Route Caches in the follow-
   ing table.  For the reasons of separating the two functions, see Sec-
   tion 1.5.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
                       Paging Caches                  Route Caches

   updated by        all update packets           route-update packets
                (paging-update, route-update)

   updated when   moving to a new Paging             moving to a new
                      Area, or after                 cell, or after
                    paging-update-time              route-update-time

   scope          both idle and active MHs         active mobile hosts

   purpose        route downlink packets if           route downlink
                there is no Route Cache entry            packets
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   The mobile host may keep receiving data packets without sending data
   for possibly long durations.  To keep its Route Cache mappings up to
   date and to avoid repeated paging, mobile hosts in active state that
   have no data to send must send periodic route-update packets.  Like
   uplink data packets, route-update packets update Route Caches and
   ensure that the hop-by-hop route from the Gateway to the mobile host
   does not time out.

   In addition, active mobile hosts must transmit a route-update packet
   when they cross cell borders. This is required because the Route
   Cache mappings associated with the new Base Station can only be
   created by authenticated route-update packets. Data packets are not
   required to carry authentication information and hence can refresh,
   but not modify Route Cache mappings.

   For reliability and timeliness, Paging Caches also contain mobile
   hosts that are contained by Route Caches.  For this reason, Paging
   Caches are updated by all uplink update packets and refreshed by all
   uplink packets including data packets as well.

2.3. Handoff


   Handoff is initiated by the mobile host.  As an active host
   approaches a new Base Station, it transmits a route-update packet and
   redirects its packets from the old to the new Base Station. The
   route-update packet will configure Route Caches along the way from
   the new Base Station to the Gateway.  (The paths leading to the old
   and new Base Stations may overlap.  In nodes where the two paths
   coincide, the route-update packet simply refreshes the old mapping
   and the handoff remains unnoticed.)

   An idle mobile host, moving to a new Base Station, transmits a
   paging-update packet only if the new Base Station is in a new Paging
   Area. During handoffs between Base Stations within the same Paging
   Area idle mobile hosts may remain silent, as paging is performed
   within the entire Paging Area.



2.4. Wide Area Mobility


   Wide area mobility occurs when the mobile host moves between Cellular
   IP Networks.  The mobile host can identify Cellular IP Networks by
   the Cellular IP Network Identifier contained in the Base Stations'
   beacon signals.  The beacon signal also contains the IP address of
   the Gateway. After successful authentication to the Cellular IP net-
   work the mobile host will invoke the IPv6 Stateless Address Auto con-
   figuration mechanism to generate a temporary Mobile IPv6 care-of
   address in the visited Cellular IP network.  This address will be
   assembled by pre pending the IPv6 subnet prefix advertised by Cellu-
   lar IP beacon signals to the mobile host's interface identifier [8].
   To ensure that the configured Mobile IPv6 care-of address is likely
   to be unique, the mobile host may run a duplicate address detection
   algorithm before assigning the new Mobile IPv6 address on its inter-
   face. For security and charging purposes, authentication and other
   user-related information may need to be provided by the mobile host,
   when it first contacts a Cellular IP Network.  This information will
   be included in the first paging-update packet and may be repeated in
   a few subsequent paging-update packets for reliability.  Upon receiv-
   ing the first paging-update packet, the Gateway performs admission
   control that may involve technical and charging decisions.  The
   Gateway's response is sent to the mobile host in regular IP
   packet(s).  If the request was accepted, the response may also carry
   the required setting for protocol parameters. Upon successful admis-
   sion, the mobile host should send binding update messages to its Home
   Agent and its correspondent nodes notifying them about its new point

   of attachment [1].

   The mobile host may leave the service area at any time without prior
   notice.  Mappings associated to the host will be cleared after the
   timeout.  Alternatively, as a performance optimization the host may
   send a paging-teardown packet to clear Cache mappings from both Route
   and Paging Caches.



2.5. Security


   Cellular IP control packets (paging-update, route-update and paging-
   teardown packets) carry mandatory Authentication Headers [3].  This
   prevents malicious mobile hosts from changing location information
   related to other mobile hosts using a spoofed source address.

   Data security issues are not discussed in this document.  We note
   that any further authentication or encryption can be performed in
   addition to control packet authentication built into Cellular IP.

3.1. Protocol Parameters


   The following parameters shall be set by network management.  The
   values listed here are for information only.  Note that in the most
   typical case a mobile host that is in active state will regularly
   transmit data packets and hence route-update packets will need to be
   transmitted at handoffs only.

3.2. Beacon Signal Structure


   Cellular IP Base Stations must periodically transmit beacon signals
   to allow for mobile hosts to identify an available Base Station.

   Beacons are sent in an IPv6 packet with Destination Options header
   [7]. This is multicast to FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 (All nodes multicast).

   Timestamp
           Contains a timestamp used to determine the order in which update
           packets are sent.  The timestamp field is formatted as specified
           by the Network Time Protocol [2].  The low-order 32 bits of the
           NTP format represent fractional seconds, and those bits which are
           not available from a time source should be generated from a good
           source of randomness.  Mobile hosts must ensure that the 64 bit
           value of timestamps is strictly increasing in consecutive control
           packets.

   CU
           Currently Unused. Must be set to 0.

   S flag
           Set to 1 to indicate semi-soft handoff. Default value is 0.  Any
           Cellular IP node that does not support semi-soft handoffs may
           ignore this bit. (See Section 4.1.1)

   I flag
           Used to indicate an indirect semi-soft handoff. Only a Base
           Station will recognize this flag and act accordingly.

   Control Information

           Currently only one is defined:

           Registration request
                   Used when a mobile host enters the Cellular IP Network.



3.3.3. Paging-update packet


   A paging-update packet is an IPv6 packet with a Hop-by-Hop Options
   extension header where

   - the source address is the IP address of the sending mobile host;
   - the destination address is the Gateway; and
   - the Hop-by-Hop option is of Paging-update type.

   The option of the paging-update packet carries control information in
   the same format as the route-update packet. The S and I flags must be
   0 for paging-update packets.

3.3.4. Paging-teardown packet


   A paging-teardown packet is an IPv6 packet with a Hop-by-Hop Options
   extension header where

   - the source address is the IP address of the sending mobile host;
   - the destination address is the Gateway; and
   - the Hop-by-Hop option is of Paging-teardown type.

   The payload of the paging-teardown packet carries control information
   in the same format as the route-update packet. The S and I flags must
   be 0 for paging-teardown packets.



3.4. Addressing


   Cellular IP requires no address space allocation beyond what is
   present in IPv6.  Mobile hosts are identified by their care-of
   addresses.



3.5. Security


   Each Cellular IP Network has a secret network key of arbitrary length
   known to all Cellular IP nodes.  The network key is kept secret from
   mobile hosts and other nodes outside the Cellular IP Network, how-
   ever.  Upon initial registration the Gateway must authenticate and
   possibly authorize the mobile host.  This initial authentication and
   authorization can be based on any known symmetric or asymmetric
   method.  After authentication the Gateway concatenates the key of the
   network and the IP address of the mobile host and calculates the PID
   of the mobile host by an MD5 Hash similarly as in [4]:

   PID := MD5(network key, IP address of MH)

   Then it acquires the public key of the mobile host from a trusted
   party, encrypts the PID and sends it to the mobile host.  This way
   the mobile host and the Cellular IP network have a shared secret. The
   PID remains the same during handoff and can be easily computed by
   each Base Station.

   The PID can be used to authenticate (and optionally to encrypt) IP
   packets over the air interface.  Authentication is performed by



Shelby, Gatzounas, Campbell, Wan                               [Page 17]

INTERNET-DRAFT               Cellular IPv6                 November 2000


   creating a short hash from the (PID, timestamp, packet content) tri-
   ple that is placed into the transmitted packets.  The validity of
   each packet can be easily checked by any Base Station even immedi-
   ately after a handoff and without prior communication with the mobile
   host or with the old Base Station.

   In addition to authenticating control packets, PID can optionally
   also be used to provide security for data packets transmitted over
   the wireless link.  To this avail, any known shared secret based
   security mechanism can be used where PID serve as the shared secret.



3.6. Cellular IP Routing


   Cellular IP nodes need only to implement the algorithm described in
   this section.  They do not need regular IP routing capability.  This
   section describes the routing algorithm in Cellular IP nodes other
   than the Gateway.  The extra functions required only in the Cellular
   IP Gateway are described in Section 3.7.



3.6.1 Topology


   In uplink direction (toward the Gateway), packets are routed in the
   Cellular IP Network on a hop-by-hop basis.  The neighbor to which a
   node will forward a packet toward the Gateway is referred to as the
   node's Uplink neighbor.  The Uplink neighbor at each node may be
   designated by network management.  Alternatively, a simplified shor-
   test path algorithm can select Uplink neighbors  instead of manual
   configuration.  (A regular shortest path algorithm is also applicable
   but is more complex than required since it determines routes to all
   nodes in the network.)  A simple algorithm that configures Uplink
   neighbors and automatically reconfigures them if necessary after a
   topology change is described in Appendix A.

   A node's neighbors other than the Uplink neighbor are called Downlink
   neighbors.



3.6.2 Uplink Routing


   A packet arriving at a node from one of its Downlink neighbors is



Shelby, Gatzounas, Campbell, Wan                               [Page 18]

INTERNET-DRAFT               Cellular IPv6                 November 2000


   assumed to be coming from a mobile host.  The packet is first used to
   update the node's Route and Paging Caches and is then forwarded to
   the node's Uplink neighbor.

   To update the Caches, the node reads the packet type, port number and
   the source IP address.  Paging-update packets update the Paging Cache
   only.  Route-update packets update both Route and Paging Caches.
   Data packets only refresh the soft state of both caches, but do not
   change it.  Both types of caches consist of

   { IPv6 address, interface, MAC address, expiration time, timestamp }

   5-tuples, called mappings.  The IPv6 address is the address of the
   mobile host the mapping corresponds to.  The interface and the MAC
   address denote the Downlink neighbor toward the mobile host.  The
   timestamp field contains the timestamp of the control packet that has
   established the mapping.

   When a data packet arrives from a Downlink neighbor, the Route Cache
   entry of the source IP address is searched first.  If the data packet
   is coming from the same neighbor as indicated by the cache entry then
   it is sent from the direction where the mobile host was last seen. In
   that case the mapping is only refreshed: the expiration time is set
   to the current time + route-timeout. If the node has Paging Cache,
   then the expiration time of the mapping in the Paging Cache is set to
   current time + paging-timeout as well.

   If the data packet arrived from a different neighbor than that is in
   its mapping or no mapping exists for the IP address, then the packet
   is dropped.

   When an update packet arrives from a Downlink neighbor then the
   authentication is first validated.  Packets with invalid authentica-
   tion must be dropped and the event should be logged as a potential
   tampering attempt.  For valid packets the node creates the following
   5-tuple:

   { the newly arrived packet's source IPv6 address,
     the interface through which it arrived,
     the source MAC address of the arrived packet,
     current time + route-timeout,
     the timestamp in the arrived update packet     }

   This mapping is used to update Route Cache, if the incoming packet is
   a route-update packet.  If a valid mapping for the source IPv6
   address already exists, then it is replaced by the new 5-tuple, if
   the timestamp is newer, otherwise the packet is dropped.  If no map-
   ping exists for the source IP address then the mapping is added to



Shelby, Gatzounas, Campbell, Wan                               [Page 19]

INTERNET-DRAFT               Cellular IPv6                 November 2000


   the Route Cache. The Paging Cache is updated in the same way, but
   using paging-timeout instead of route-timeout.  If the node has no
   Paging Cache then only the Route Cache is updated.  If the incoming
   packet is a paging-update, then only the Paging Cache is updated (if
   any).

   If the packet is a paging-teardown packet and the authentication
   information is valid, then mappings of the mobile host with timestamp
   earlier than the timestamp of the packet are removed from both the
   Route and the Paging Cache.

   After cache modifications the control packet is forwarded to the
   Uplink neighbor.



3.6.3 Downlink Routing


   A packet arriving to a Cellular IP node from the Uplink neighbor is
   assumed to be addressed to a mobile host.  The node first checks if
   the destination IP address has a valid mapping in the Route Cache.
   If such a mapping exists, the packet is forwarded to the Downlink
   neighbor found in the mapping.

   If the Route Cache contains no mapping for the destination IP address
   and the node has no Paging Cache, then the packet is broadcast on all
   interfaces of the node except the interface of the Uplink neighbor.

   If the node has Paging Cache and there is a mapping for the destina-
   tion IP address, then the packet is forwarded to the neighbor found
   in that mapping.

   If the node has Paging Cache, but there is no mapping for the desti-
   nation IP address, then the packet is dropped.



3.7. Cellular IP Gateway


   The following figure is a schematic view of a Cellular IP Gateway.
   The Gateway can logically be divided into three building blocks: a
   regular Cellular IP node, a Gateway Packet Filter and a Gateway Con-
   troller.

   IP node block and are forwarded towards the Gateway filter.  The
   Gateway filter reads the destination IP address.  If this is the
   Gateway's address, the packet is forwarded to the Gateway controller.
   Most of these packets are control packets with empty control informa-
   tion field and are immediately dropped.  If the packet carries con-
   trol information, for instance a registration request, it is inter-
   preted and processed by the Gateway controller.

   If the destination address is not the Gateway's, the packet is for-
   warded to the Internet.  (This means that a packet sent from a mobile
   host to another mobile host in the same Cellular IP Network goes
   through the destination Home Agent.  However, this is not the case if
   route optimization is used.  To operate efficiently even without
   Mobile IP route optimization, the Gateway Packet Filter can also
   check if the destination address of an uplink packet has a valid map-
   ping in any of the Gateway's caches.  If a mapping is found, the
   packet is "turned back" and is treated as a downlink packet.)

   All packets arriving from the Internet are forwarded normally to the
   Cellular IP node block. The Gateway's Cellular IP node block treats
   these packets as determined by the Cellular IP Routing algorithm
   (Section 3.6) according to the mappings in Route and Paging Cache.
   It is optional whether Cellular IP Nodes have Paging Cache configured
   or not. However, it is recommended that at least the Gateway's Cellu-
   lar IP node has a Paging Cache configured.  This ensures that packets
   addressed to hosts currently not connected to the Cellular IP Network
   do not enter the network and do not load it in vain but are immedi-
   ately discarded in the Gateway when neither Route, nor Paging Cache
   mapping is found for the destination address.  (It may be advanta-
   geous to also generate an ICMP message in this case and send it back

   to the packet's source address.)



3.8. Cellular IP Mobile Host


   While connected to a Cellular IP Network, a mobile host must be in
   one of two states: 'active' or 'idle'.  The host moves from idle to
   active state when it receives or wishes to send a data packet.
   Active state is maintained as long as the host is transmitting or
   receiving data packets.  When the host has not received or transmit-
   ted any data packets for some time (the value of this timer may be
   implementation-specific) then it returns to idle state.

   When the host moves from idle to active state, it must transmit a
   route-update packet.  At the same time, a timer is initiated from a
   value equal to route-update-time.  If the timer expires without any
   data packet being transmitted from the host, again a route-update
   packet is transmitted and the timer is re-initiated.  Any IP packet
   transmitted before the timer expires, resets the timer to route-
   update-time.  This ensures that while the mobile host is in active
   state, the largest interval between two transmitted packets is never
   longer than route-update-time.  The mechanism also ensures that if
   data packets are transmitted with sufficient frequency, no route-
   update packets will be generated, which will probably be typical.

   If the host is in active state, it must immediately transmit a
   route-update packet whenever it connects to a new base station.  This
   typically happens at migration, but is also the case after a wireless
   channel black-out or when the host enters the Cellular IP Network. A
   packet transmitted this way also resets the route-update packet
   timer.

   In idle state, the mobile host must transmit paging-update packets
   periodically, at intervals of paging-update-time.  In addition, the
   host must transmit a paging-update packet when it connects to a new
   Base Station which has a different Paging Area ID from the previous
   Base Station.  (When connecting to a Base Station that belongs to the
   same Paging Area as the previous one, the host need not transmit
   paging-update packet.) Similarly to the route-update packet timer,
   the paging-update timer is reset if a data packet is transmitted.

   The mobile host must ensure that the 64 bit value of timestamps is
   strictly increasing in consecutive control packets.

   The mobile host processes all IPv6 packets which it receives. If an
   IPv6 packet carries a Routing extension header then it is processed



Shelby, Gatzounas, Campbell, Wan                               [Page 22]

INTERNET-DRAFT               Cellular IPv6                 November 2000


   normally to cause the packet to be delivered to the upper layers (the
   home address of the mobile host is included in the Routing header as
   the final destination of the packet). Alternatively, the packet is
   received encapsulated into an IPv6 tunnel header. In this case the
   mobile host performs IPv6 decapsulation to extract the original IPv6
   packet and then sends a Mobile IPv6 binding update message to the
   packet sender.



4. Extensions to Cellular IP

4.1. Handoff Extensions

4.1.1. Semi-soft Handoff

   When a mobile host switches to a new Base Station it sends a route-
   update packet to make the chain of cache bindings to point to the new
   Base Station.  Packets that are traveling on the old path will be
   delivered to the old Base Station and will be lost.  Although this
   loss may be small it can potentially degrade TCP throughput.  This
   kind of handoff, when the mobile switches all at once to the new Base
   Station is called "hard" handoff. For performance details of hard
   handoff in a Cellular IP network see [5].

   To improve the performance of loss sensitive applications, another
   type of handoff may be introduced, called "semi-soft" handoff.  Dur-
   ing semi-soft handoff a mobile host may be in contact with either of
   the old and new Base Stations and receive packets from them.  Packets
   intended to the mobile host are sent to both Base Stations, so when
   the mobile host eventually moves to the new location it can continue
   to receive packets without interruption.

   To initiate semi-soft handoff, the moving mobile host transmits a
   route-update packet to the new Base Station and continues to listen
   to the old one.  The S flag is set in this route-update packet to
   indicate semi-soft handoff.  Semi-soft route-update packets create
   new mappings in the Route and Paging Cache similarly to regular
   route-update packets. When the semi-soft route-update packet reaches
   the cross-over node where the old and new path meet (note that the
   cross-over node already has a mapping for the mobile host), the new
   mapping is added to the cache instead of replacing the old one.
   Packets sent to the mobile host are transmitted to both Downlink
   neighbors.  When the mobile host eventually makes the move then the
   packets will already be underway to the new Base Station and the
   handoff can be performed with minimal packet loss. After migration
   the mobile host sends a route-update packet to the new Base Station
   with the S bit cleared. This route-update packet will remove all



Shelby, Gatzounas, Campbell, Wan                               [Page 23]

INTERNET-DRAFT               Cellular IPv6                 November 2000


   mappings in Route Cache except for the ones pointing to the new Base
   Station.  The semi-soft handoff is then complete.

   If the path to the new Base Station is longer than to the old Base
   Station or it takes non negligible time to switch to the new Base
   Station, then some packets may not reach the mobile host.  To over-
   come the problem, packets sent to the new Base Station can be delayed
   during the semi-soft handoff.  This way a few packets may be
   delivered twice to the mobile host, but in many cases this results in
   better performance than a few packets lost.  Introduction of packet
   delay can be best performed in the Cellular IP node that has multiple
   mappings for the mobile host as a result of a semi-soft route-update
   packet.  Packets that belong to flows that require low delay but can
   tolerate occasional losses should not be delayed. For performance
   details of semi-soft handoff in a Cellular IP network see [5].



4.1.2. Indirect Semi-soft Handoff


   Not all wireless technologies have simultaneous connection capabil-
   ity. e.g. They cannot listen to the current BS while sending a
   route-update packet to the new BS (as required in 4.1.1).  For this
   situation an alternative indirect technique is used.  It is assumed
   the network can obtain the IP address of the new BS.  This is the
   case in many cellular networks.

   When the mobile decides to make a handoff, instead of sending a
   route-update packet to the new BS directly (as it cannot), it sends
   the packet to the current BS.  This packet will have as a destination
   IP address, the IP address of the new BS.  Unlike in section 4.1.1.
   the I flag will be set to indicate indirect semi-soft handoff.  The
   current BS will forward this uplink to the Gateway normally.  The
   Gateway then uses normal IP routing to deliver the packet to the new
   BS. When the new BS receives the indirect handoff packet, a semi-soft
   route update packet is created with the IP address of the mobile
   host.  It is then forwarded upstream. The algorithm then proceeds to
   work as in 4.1.1, just as if the packet had originated through the
   new BS. A security association is assumed for the new BS.



4.2. Multiple Gateway Networks


   Cellular IP requires that a mobile host be using exactly one Gateway
   at a time.  This requirement comes from the fact that the Gateway



Shelby, Gatzounas, Campbell, Wan                               [Page 24]

INTERNET-DRAFT               Cellular IPv6                 November 2000


   relays its packets both up and downlink.  It is also required to make
   uplink routing unambiguous.  The Cellular IP Network can have multi-
   ple Gateways as long as a single host still uses just one Gateway at
   any time. (The host can change Gateway, involving a Mobile IPv6 loca-
   tion updating.) In a Network with multiple Gateways, nodes must be
   able to determine which Gateway a given mobile host is using.
   Assignment of Gateways can, for instance, be based on geographical
   partitioning of the network, or on partitioning the mobile hosts'
   address space.  This issue is for further study.



4.3. Charging


   Cellular IP Network providers can charge Cellular IP Mobile users for
   connectivity or for transmitted data or both.  Charging information
   is best collected in the Gateway.  The Gateway receives all control
   packets and can determine the time a mobile host was connected to the
   network.  It can also measure through traffic in both directions.



5. Security Considerations


   A Cellular IP Network is a single administrative domain.  It is con-
   nected to the Internet through a Gateway that may eventually also
   serve as a firewall.  Hence security issues only need to be con-
   sidered at the wireless interface.

   The security of a Cellular IP system will be determined by the wire-
   less link.  Security issues relating to wireless links are not
   specific to Cellular IP, and are out of the scope of Cellular IP,
   even though they must be dealt with in practical Cellular IP imple-
   mentations.

   A security problem specific to Cellular IP is the security of the
   control packets, which can be solved by the authentication mechanism
   described in Section 3.5.



6. Intellectual Property Right Notice


   Ericsson has filed patent applications that might possibly become
   essential to the implementation of this contribution.

Appendix A. Uplink Neighbor Selection


   This algorithm selects the Uplink neighbor of all nodes of a Cellular
   IPv6 Network and reconfigures them if necessary after a change of
   topology.  An Uplink neighbor is identified by the interface through
   which it is accessible from the node and its corresponding MAC
   address.  The algorithm also distributes the Cellular IP Network
   Identifier, the IP address of the Gateway and the Paging Area IDs to
   the Base Stations.

   The Gateway periodically creates a control packet called a "Gateway
   broadcast packet".  Packet uses a hop-by-hop extension header. The
   Gateway broadcast packet contains

   - the Cellular IP Network Identifier;
   - the IP address of the Gateway;
   - a sequence number increased each time by the Gateway; and
   - a Paging Area ID field initially set to the ID of the Gateway.

   The Gateway broadcasts the packet on all of its interfaces except
   those connected to the Internet.  A Cellular IP node receiving a
   Gateway broadcast packet follows the steps below.

   1) It drops the packet if the sequence number is lower or equal to
      the sequence number of one of the previously received Gateway
      broadcast packets.  In this case no further processing is needed.
   2) It stores the sequence number of the Gateway broadcast packet for
      later comparison.
   3) It stores the Cellular IP Network Identifier and the IP address of
      the Gateway.
   3) It stores the interface through which the packet arrived together
      with source MAC address of the packet (if any) to identify the

      Uplink neighbor.  All other interface/MAC address combinations
      will denote Downlink neighbors.
   4) If the node has a Paging Cache, it overwrites the value of the
      Paging Area ID field in the packet by its own ID.
   5) The value of the (possibly overwritten) Paging Area ID field is
      stored as the Paging Area ID of the node.  This value will be used
      in beacon signals if the node is a Base Station.
   6) It stores the Cellular IP Network Identifier and the IP address of
      the Gateway.  These values will be used in beacon signals if the
      node is a Base Station.
   7) After a short random delay, the node broadcasts the packet through
      all of its interfaces, except the air interface(s) and the
      interface of the Uplink neighbor.
