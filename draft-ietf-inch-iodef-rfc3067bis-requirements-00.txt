     1. Abstracts 
         
        The purpose of the Incident Object Description and Exchange Format is 
        to define a common data format for describing and exchanging incident 
        information between collaborating Computer Security Incident Response 
        Teams (CSIRTs). The specific goals and requirements of the IODEF are 
        described in [2]. One of the design principles in the IODEF is 
        compatibility with the Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format 
        (IDMEF) [3] developed for intrusion detection systems. For this 
        reason, IODEF is heavily based on the IDMEF and provides upward 
        compatibility with it. 

      
                                                                   [Page 1]

        The purpose of the Incident Object Description and Exchange Format is 
        to define a common data format for the description, archiving and 
        exchange of information about incidents between CSIRTs (Computer 
        Security Incident Response Teams) (including alert, incident in 
        investigation, archiving, statistics, reporting, etc.).  This 
        document describes the high-level requirements for such a description 
        and exchange format, including the reasons for those requirements. 
        Examples are used to illustrate the requirements where necessary. 
         
         
         
     1. Conventions used in this document 
         
        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
        document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1]. 
         
         
     2. Introduction 
         
        This document is a revision of RFC 3067 [2] which defined 
        requirements for the initial development of the Incident Object 
        Description and Exchange Format (IODEF) by TERENA IODEF WG [3] which 
        since IETF53 transferred further development of the IODEF to IETF 
        INCH Working Group [4]. 
         
        This document itself defines requirements for the IODEF. IODEF is 
        intended to be a standard format which allows Computer Security 
        Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) to exchange operational and 
        statistical information; it may also provide a basis for the 
        development of compatible and inter-operable tools for Incident 
        recording, tracking and exchange. 
         
        Most of revisions of RFC3067 are compliant to currently published 
        IODEF Data Model and XML Data Type Description Internet-draft [5]. 
         
        This document also has intention to provide requirement document that 
        is open for discussion in IETF INCH WG and will evolve together with 
        ongoing IODEF development and implementation.  
         
        Further discussion of this document will take place on the INCH WG 
        mailing lists < inch@nic.surfnet.nl>, archive is available at 
        http://listserv.surfnet.nl/archives/inch.html 
         
         
        2.1. Rationale 
         
        Computer Incidents are becoming distributed and International and 
        involve many CSIRTs across borders, languages and cultures.  Post- 
        Incident information and statistics exchange is important for future 
        Incident prevention and Internet security improvement.  The key

     INTERNET DRAFT            IODEF Requirements             October, 2002 

        element for information exchange in all these cases is a common 
        format for Incident (Object) description. 
         
        It is probable that in further development or implementation the 
        IODEF might be used for forensic purposes, and this means that 
        Incident description must be unambiguous and allow for future custody 
        (archiving/documentation) features. 
         
        Another issue that is targeted by developing IODEF is a need to have 
        higher level Incident description and exchange format than will be 
        provided by IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems) and the proposed IDMEF 
        (Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format).  Compatibility with 
        IDMEF and other related standards will be satisfied by the IODEF 
        requirement on modularity and extensibility.  IODEF should vertically 
        be compatible with IDMEF, IODEF might be able to include or reference 
        IDMEF Alert message as initial information about Incident. 
         
        2.2. Incident Description Terms 
         
        A definition of the main terms used in the rest of document is given 
        for clarity. 
         
        Where possible, existing definitions will be used; some definitions 
        will need additional detail and further consideration. 
         
        Currently proposed definitions are based on the Taxonomy of the 
        Computer Security Incident related terminology made by TERENA's IODEF 
        WG [2] and presented in [6], other documents used include [7, 8]. 
         
        2.2.1. Attack 
         
        An assault on system security that derives from an intelligent 
        threat, i.e., an intelligent act that is a deliberate attempt 
        (especially in the sense of a method or technique) to evade security 
        services and violate the security policy of a system. 
         
        Attack can be active or passive, by insider or by outsider, or via 
        attack mediator. 
         
        2.2.2. Attacker 
         
        Attacker is individual who attempts one or more attacks in order to 
        achieve an objective(s). 
         
        For the purpose of IODEF attacker is described by its network ID, 
        organisation which network/computer attack was originated and 
        physical location information (optional). 
         
        2.2.3. CSIRT 
         
        CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team) is used in IODEF to 
        refer to the authority handling the Incident and creating Incident

     INTERNET DRAFT            IODEF Requirements             October, 2002 

        Object Description.  The CSIRT is also likely to be involved in 
        evidence collection and custody, incident remedy, etc. 
         
        In IODEF CSIRT represented by its ID, constituency, public key, etc. 
         
        2.2.4. Damage 
         
        An intended or unintended consequence of an attack which affects the 
        normal operation of the targeted system or service.  Description of 
        damage may include free text description of actual result of attack, 
        and, where possible, structured information about the particular 
        damaged system, subsystem or service. 
         
        2.2.5. Event 
         
        An action directed at a target which is intended to result in a 
        change of state (status) of the target.  From the point of view of 
        event origination, it can be defined as any observable occurrence in 
        a system or network which resulted in an alert being generated.  For 
        example, three failed logins in 10 seconds might indicate a brute- 
        force login attack. 
         
        2.2.6. Evidence 
         
        Evidence is information relating to an event that proves or supports 
        a conclusion about the event. With respect to security incidents (the 
        events), it may include but is not limited to: data dump created by 
        Intrusion Detection System (IDS), data from syslog file, kernel 
        statistics, cache, memory, temporary file system, or other data that 
        caused the alert or were collected after the incident happened. 
         
        Special rules and care must be taken when storing and archiving 
        evidence, particularly to preserve its integrity.  When necessary 
        evidence should be stored encrypted. 
         
        According to the Guidelines for Evidence Collection and Archiving 
        (Evidence) evidence must be strictly secured.  The chain of evidence 
        custody needs to be clearly documented. 
         
        It is essential that evidence should be collected, archived and 
        preserved according to local legislation. 
         
        2.2.7. Incident 
         
        An Incident is a security event that involves a security violation. 
        An incident can be defined as a single attack or a group of attacks 
        that can be distinguished from other attacks by the method of attack, 
        identity of attackers, victims, sites, objectives or timing, etc. 
         
        An incident is a root element of the IODEF. In the context of IODEF, 
        the term Incident is used to mean a Computer Security Incident or an 
        IT Security Incident. 
         
      
     Demchenko             Expires April 2003              [Page 4] 
      
     INTERNET DRAFT            IODEF Requirements             October, 2002 

        However we should distinguish between the generic definition of 
        'Incident' which is an event that might lead to damage or damage 
        which is not too serious, and 'Security Incident' and 'IT Security 
        Incident' which are defined below: 
         
        a) Security incident is an event that involves a security violation. 
        This may be an event that violates a security policy, UAP, laws and 
        jurisdictions, etc. A security incident may also be an incident that 
        has been escalated to a security incident. 
         
        A security incident is worse than an incident as it affects the 
        security of or in the organisation. A security incident may be 
        logical, physical or organisational, for example a computer 
        intrusion, loss of secrecy, information theft, fire or an alarm that 
        doesn't work properly.  A security incident may be caused on purpose 
        or by accident.  The latter may be if somebody forgets to lock a door 
        or forgets to activate an access list in a router. 
         
        b) An IT security incident is defined according to [9] as any real or    
        suspected adverse event in relation to the security of a computer or 
        computer network.  Typical security incidents within the IT area are: 
        a computer intrusion, a denial-of-service attack, information theft 
        or data manipulation, etc. 
         
        2.2.8. Impact 
         
        Impact describes result of attack expressed in terms of user 
        community, for example the cost in terms of financial or other 
        disruption 
         
        2.2.9. Target 
         
        A computer or network logical entity (account, process or data) or 
        physical entity (component, computer, network or internetwork). 
         
        2.2.10. Victim 
         
        Victim is individual or organisation which suffered the attack which 
        is described in incident report. 
         
        For the purpose of IODEF victim is described by its network ID, 
        organisation and location information. 
         
        2.2.11. Vulnerability 
         
        A flaw or weakness in a system's design, implementation, or operation 
        and management that could be exploited to violate the system's 
        security policy. 
         
        Most systems have vulnerabilities of some sort, but this does not 
        mean that the systems are too flawed to use.  Not every threat 
        results in an attack, and not every attack succeeds.  Success depends 
        on the degree of vulnerability, the strength of attacks, and the 
      
     Demchenko             Expires April 2003              [Page 5] 
      
     INTERNET DRAFT            IODEF Requirements             October, 2002 

        effectiveness of any countermeasures in use.  If the attacks needed 
        to exploit a vulnerability are very difficult to carry out, then the 
        vulnerability may be tolerable.  If the perceived benefit to an 
        attacker is small, then even an easily exploited vulnerability may be 
        tolerable.  However, if the attacks are well understood and easily 
        made, and if the vulnerable system is employed by a wide range of 
        users, then it is likely that there will be enough benefit for 
        someone to make an attack. 
         
        2.2.12. Other terms 
         
        Other terms used: alert, activity, IDS, Security Policy, etc., - are 
        defined in related I-Ds, RFCs and standards [7 - 12]. 
         
     3. General Requirements 
         
        3.1. The IODEF shall reference and use previously published RFCs   
        where possible. 
         
        Comment: The IETF has already developed a number of standards in the 
        areas of networks and security that are actually deployed in present 
        Internet. Current standards provide framework for compatibility of 
        IODEF with other related technologies necessary to operate /implement 
        IODEF in practice.  Another issue of compatibility for the IODEF is 
        its general compatibility with IDMEF developed by IETF IDWG.  In the 
        interest of time and compatibility, defined and accepted standards 
        should be used wherever possible. 
         
        In particularly, IODEF specification proposals SHOULD rely heavily on 
        existing communications, encryption and language standards, where 
        possible. 
         
     4. Description Format 
         
        4.1. IODEF shall support full internationalization and localization. 
         
        Comment: Since some Incidents need involvement of CSIRTs from 
        different countries, cultural and geographic regions, the IODEF 
        description must be formatted such that they can be presented to an 
        operator in a local language and adhering to local presentation 
        formats. 
         
        Although metalanguage for IODEF identifiers and labels is considered 
        to be English, a local IODEF implementation might be capable to 
        translate metalanguage identifiers and labels into local language and 
        presentations if necessary. 
         
        Localized presentation of dates, time and names may also be required. 
        In cases where the messages contain text strings and names that need 
        characters other than Latin-1 (or ISO 8859-1), the information 
        preferably should be represented using the ISO/IEC IS 10646-1 
        character set and encoded using the UTF-8 transformation format, and 
        optionally using local character sets and encodings.

     INTERNET DRAFT            IODEF Requirements             October, 2002 

         
        4.2. The IODEF must support modularity in Incident description to 
        allow aggregation and filtering of data. 
         
        Comment: It is suggested that Incident description with IODEF might 
        include external information, e.g., from IDS, or reference externally 
        stored evidence custody data, or such information might be removed 
        from current IODEF description, e.g., in purposes of privacy or 
        security. Another practical/real life motivation for this requirement 
        is to give possibility for some CSIRTs/managers to perform filtering 
        and/or data aggregation functions on IODEF descriptions for the 
        purposes of statistics, reporting and high level Incident information 
        exchange between CSIRTs and/or their constituency and sponsors. 
         
        Therefore the IODEF descriptions MUST be structured to facilitate 
        these operations.  This also implies to strong IODEF semantics. 
         
        4.3. IODEF must support the application of an access restriction 
        policy to individual components and to individual accessing entities. 
         
        Comment: IODEF Incident descriptions potentially contain sensitive or 
        private information (such as passwords, persons/organisations 
        identifiers or forensic information (evidence data)) and in some 
        cases may be exposed to non-authorised persons.  Such situations may 
        arise particularly in case of Incident information exchange between 
        CSIRTs or other involved bodies. Technical realization may included 
        using special restriction attributes or general external technology 
        available with implementation format (like XSLT for XML based IODEF  
        implementation), which can be applied by Incident Handling System. 
        Some cases may be addressed by encrypting IODEF elements, however 
        this will not always be possible. 
         
        Therefore, to prevent accidental disclosure of sensitive data, parts 
        of the IODEF object must be marked with access restriction 
        attributes.  These markings will be particularly useful when used 
        with automated processing systems. 
         
         
     5. Communications Mechanisms Requirements 
         
        5.1. IODEF exchange will normally be initiated by humans using 
        standard communication protocols, for example, e-mail, HTTP, XML Web 
        Services (based on SOAP XML Protocol). 
         
        Comment: IODEF description is normally created by a human using 
        special or standard text editors.  The IODEF is targeted to be 
        processed by automated Incident handling systems but still must be 
        human readable, able to be viewed and browsed with standard tools 
        (e.g., browsers or electronic table processors or database tools like 
        MS Excel or Access).  Incident information exchange will normally 
        require authorisation by  an operator or CSIRT manager so is not 
        expected to be initiated automatically.  The role of Incident

     INTERNET DRAFT            IODEF Requirements             October, 2002 

        handling system is to provide assistance and tools for performing the 
        exchange. 
         
        It is important to distinguish the purposes of the machine readable 
        and exchangeable IDEF Intrusion message format and the human oriented 
        and created IODEF Incident description. 
         
        Communications security requirements will be applied separately 
        according to local policy so are not defined by this document. 
         
     6. Message Contents 
         
        6.1. The root element of the IO description should contain a unique   
        identification number (or identifier), IO purpose and default   
        permission level 
         
        Comment: Unique identification number (or identifier) is necessary to 
        distinguish one Incident from another.  It is suggested that unique 
        identification number will contain information at least about IO 
        creator, i.e. CSIRT or related body.  The classification of the 
        Incident may also be used to form a unique identification number.  IO 
        purpose will actually control which elements are included in the 
        IODEF object Purposes may include incident alert/registration, 
        handling, archiving, reporting or statistics.  The purpose, incident 
        type or status of Incident investigation may require different levels 
        of access permission for the Incident information. 
         
        It is considered that root element of the IODEF will be <INCIDENT> 
        and additional information will be treated as attributes of the root 
        element. 
         
         
        6.2. The content of the IODEF description should contain the type of   
        the attack if it is known. 
         
        It is expected that this type will be drawn from a standardized list 
        of events; a new type of event may use a temporary implementation- 
        specific type if the event type has not yet been standardized. 
         
        Comment: Incident handling may involve many different staff members 
        and teams. It is therefore essential that common terms are used to 
        describe incidents. 
         
        If the event type has not yet been standardized, temporary type 
        definition might be given by team created IO.  It is expected that 
        new type name will be self-explanatory and derived from a similar, 
        existing type definition. 
         
        6.3. The IODEF description must be structured such that any relevant   
        advisories, such as those from CERT/CC, CVE, can be referenced. 
         
        Comment: Using standard Advisories and lists of known Attacks and 
        Vulnerabilities will allow the use of their recommendations on

     INTERNET DRAFT            IODEF Requirements             October, 2002 

        Incident handling/prevention.  Such information might be included as 
        an attribute to the attack or vulnerability type definition. 
         
        6.4. IODEF may include a detailed description of the attack that   
        caused the current Incident. 
         
        Comment: Description of attack includes information about attacker 
        and victim, the appearance of the attack and possible impact.  At the 
        early stage of Intrusion alert and Incident handling there is likely 
        to be minimal information, during handling of the Incident this will 
        grow to be sufficient for Incident investigation and remedy. Element 
        <ATTACK> should be one of the main elements of Incident description. 
         
        6.5. The IODEF description must include or be able to reference   
        additional detailed data related to this specific underlying   
        event(s)/activity, often referred as evidence. 
         
        Comment: For many purposes Incident description does not need many 
        details on specific event(s)/activity that caused the Incident; this 
        information may be referenced as external information (by means of 
        URL).  In some cases it might be convenient to store separately 
        evidence that has different access permissions.  It is foreseen that 
        another standard will be proposed for evidence custody [5]. 
         
         
        6.6. The IODEF description MUST contain the description of the   
        attacker and victim. 
         
        Comment: This information is necessary to identify the source and 
        target of the attack.  The minimum information about attacker and 
        victim is their IP or Internet addresses, extended information will 
        identify their organisations allowing CSIRTs to take appropriate 
        measures for their particular constituency. 
         
        6.7. The IODEF description must support the representation of   
        different types of device addresses, e.g., IP address (version 4 or   
        6) and Internet name. 
         
        Comment: The sites from which attack is launched might have addresses 
        in various levels of the network protocol hierarchy (e.g., Data layer 
        2 MAC addresses or Network layer 3 IP addresses).  Additionally, the 
        devices involved in an intrusion event might use addresses that are 
        not IP-centric, e.g., ATM-addresses.  It is also understood that 
        information about the source and target of the attack might be 
        obtained from IDS and include the IP address, MAC address or both. 
         
        6.8. IODEF must include the Identity of the creator (or current 
        owner) of the Incident Object (CSIRT or other authority).  This may 
        be the sender in an information exchange or the team currently 
        handling the incident. 
         
        Comment: The identity of Incident description creator is often 
        valuable information for Incident response.  In one possible scenario 
      
     Demchenko             Expires April 2003              [Page 9] 
      
     INTERNET DRAFT            IODEF Requirements             October, 2002 

        the attack may progress through the network, comparison of 
        corresponding incidents reported by different authorities might 
        provide some additional information about the origin of the attack.  
        This is also useful information at post-incident information 
        handling/exchange stage. 
         
        Experience based on initial IODEF development also uses working 
        concept of Incident Object ownership for resolving technical problems 
        with identifying and tracking Incident reports. 
         
        6.9. The IODEF description must contain an indication of the   
        possible impact of this event on the target.  The value of this   
        field should be drawn from a standardized list of values if the   
        attack is recognized as known, or expressed in a free language by   
        responsible CSIRT team member. 
         
        Comment: Information concerning the possible impact of the event on 
        the target system provides an indication of what the attacker is 
        attempting to do and is critical data for the CSIRTs to take actions 
        and perform damage assessment.  If no reference information 
        (Advisories) is available, this field may be filled in based on CSIRT 
        team experience. 
         
        It is expected that most CSIRTs will develop Incident handling 
        support systems, based on existing Advisories (such as those from 
        CERT/CC, CVE, etc.) that usually contain list of possible impacts for 
        identified attacks. 
         
        This also relates to the development of IDEF which will be 
        implemented in intelligent IDS, able to retrieve information from 
        standard databases of attacks and vulnerabilities. 
         
        6.10. The IODEF must be able to state the degree of confidence in    
        the report information. 
         
        Comment: Including this information is essential at the stage of 
        Incident creation, particularly in cases when intelligent automatic 
        IDS or expert systems are used.  These normally use statistical 
        engines to estimate the event probability. 
         
        6.11. The IODEF description must provide information about the    
        actions taken in the course of this incident by previous CSIRTs. 
         
        Comment: The IODEF describes an Incident throughout its life-time 
        from Alert to closing and archiving.  It is essential to track all 
        actions taken by all involved parties.  This will help determine what 
        further action needs to be taken, if any.  This is especially 
        important in case of Incident information exchange between CSIRTs in 
        process of investigation. 
         
        6.12. The IODEF must support reporting of the time of all stages    
        along Incident life-time.

     INTERNET DRAFT            IODEF Requirements             October, 2002 

        Comment: Time is important from both a reporting and correlation 
        point of view.  Time is one of main components that can identify the 
        same Incident or attack if launched from many sites or distributed 
        over the network.  Time is also essential to be able to track the 
        life of an Incident including Incident exchange between CSIRTs in 
        process of investigating. 
         
         
        6.13. Time shall be reported as the local time and time zone offset    
        from UTC.  (Note: See RFC 1902 for guidelines on reporting time.) 
         
        Comment: For event correlation purposes, it is important that the 
        manager be able to normalize the time information reported in the 
        IODEF descriptions. 
         
        6.14. The format for reporting the date must be compliant with all    
        current standards for Year 2000 rollover, and it must have    
        sufficient capability to continue reporting date values past the    
        year 2038. 
         
        Comment: It is stated in the purposes of the IODEF that the IODEF 
        shall describe the Incident throughout its life-time.  In the case of 
        archiving this duration might be unlimited.  Therefore, 
        implementations that limit expression of time value (such as 2038 
        date representation limitation in "Unix time") MUST be avoided. 
         
        6.15. Time granularity in IO time parameters shall not be specified    
        by the IODEF. 
         
        Comment: The time data may be included into IODEF description by 
        existing information systems, retrieved from incident reporting 
        messages or taken from IDS data or other event registration tools.  
        Each of these cases may have its own different time granularity.  For 
        the purposes of implementation, it should be possible to handle time 
        at different stages according to the local system capabilities. 
         
        6.16. The IODEF should provide the possibility to secure the 
        confidentiality of the description content. 
         
        The selected design should be capable of supporting a variety of 
        encryption algorithms and must be adaptable to a wide variety of 
        environments. However, to simplify technical implementations, 
        implementers may choose to use confidentiality preserving methods and 
        solutions external to Incident Object itself. 
         
        Comment: IODEF Incident descriptions potentially contain sensitive or 
        private information (such as forensic data (evidence data), 
        passwords, or person/organisation identifiers) which would be of 
        great interest to an attacker or malefactor.  Incident information 
        normally will be stored on a networked computer, which potentially 
        may be exposed to attacks (or compromised).  Incident information may 
        be transmitted across uncontrolled network segments.  Therefore, it 
        is important that the content be protected from unauthorised access

     INTERNET DRAFT            IODEF Requirements             October, 2002 

        and modification.  Furthermore, since the legal environment for 
        privacy and encryption technologies are varied from regions and 
        countries and change often, it is important that the design selected 
        be capable of supporting a number of different encryption options and 
        be adaptable by the user to a variety of environments. Additional 
        measures may be undertaken for securing the Incident during 
        communication but this issue is outside of IODEF scope as it implies 
        more strict rules for IO archiving and storing in general. 
         
        6.17. The IODEF should ensure the integrity of the description    
        content. 
         
        The selected design should be capable of supporting a variety of 
        integrity mechanisms and must be adaptable to a wide variety of 
        environments. 
         
        Comment: Special measures should be undertaken to prevent malicious 
        IO changes. 
         
        Additional measures may be undertaken for securing the Incident 
        during communication but this issue is outside of IODEF scope. 
         
        6.18. The IODEF should ensure the authenticity of the Incident 
        description content. 
         
        Authenticity ensuring method should be also capable to provide non-
        repudiation of Incident report exchanged between communicating 
        CSIRTs. 
         
        Comment: Authenticity and accountability is needed by many teams, 
        especially given the desire to automatically handle IOs, therefore it 
        MUST be included in the IODEF.  Because of the importance of IO 
        authenticity and non-repudiation to many teams and especially in case 
        of communication between them, the implementation of these 
        requirements is strongly RECOMMENDED. 
         
        6.19. The IODEF description must support an extension mechanism    
        which may be used by implementers.  This allows future    
        implementation-specific or experimental data.  The implementer    
        MUST indicate how to interpret any included extensions. 
         
        Comment: Implementers might wish to supply extra data such as 
        information for internal purposes or necessary for the particular 
        implementation of their Incident handling system.  These data may be 
        removed or not in external communications but it is essential to mark 
        them as additional to prevent wrong interpretation by different 
        systems. 
         
         
        6.20. The semantics of the IODEF description must be well defined. 
         
        Comment: IODEF is a human oriented format for Incident description, 
        and IODEF description should be capable of being read by humans.  The

     INTERNET DRAFT            IODEF Requirements             October, 2002 

        use of automatic parsing tools is foreseen but should not be 
        critically necessary.  Therefore, IODEF must provide  good semantics, 
        which will be  key to understanding what the description contains.  
        In some cases the IODEF description will be used for  automatic 
        decision making, so it is important that the description be 
        interpreted correctly.  This is an argument for using language-based 
        semantics. The metalanguage for IODEF identifiers and labels is 
        proposed to be English, a local IODEF implementation might be able to 
        translate metalanguage identifiers and labels into local language and 
        presentations if necessary. 
         
     7. IODEF extensibility 
         
        7.1. The IODEF itself MUST be extensible.  It is essential that when   
        the use of new technologies and development of automated Incident   
        handling system demands extension of IODEF, the IODEF will be   
        capable to include new information. 
         
        Comment: In addition to the need to extend IODEF to support new 
        Incident handling tools, it is also suggested that IODEF will 
        incorporate new developments from related standardisation areas such 
        as IDEF for IDS or the development of special format for evidence 
        custody.  The procedure for extension should be based on CSIRT/IODEF 
        community acceptance/approval. 
         
         
     8. Security Considerations 
         
        This memo describes requirements to an Incident Object Description 
        and Exchange Format, which intends to define a common data format for 
        the description, archiving and exchange of information about 
        incidents between CSIRTs (including alert, incident in investigation, 
        archiving, statistics, reporting, etc.).  In that respect the 
        implementation of the IODEF is a subject to security considerations. 
        Particular security requirement to access restriction indication is 
        discussed in section 4.3, requirements to Incident description 
        confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and non-repudiation are 
        described in sections 6.16, 6.17, 6.18.
