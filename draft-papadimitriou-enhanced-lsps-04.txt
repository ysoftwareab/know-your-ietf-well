1. Introduction

   Current IP protocols extensions for Integrated or Differentiated
   services, for Traffic-Engineering (Multi-Protocol Label Switching),
   for privacy (Virtual Private Networks), for multicast applications
   (IP Multicast protocols) and for security (IPSec Protocol) result
   from the short-term perspective when the IP protocol was defined at
   the beginning of the eighties. Now, the current developments on
   optical networking are challenging the same problem: if these
   features are not included from the beginning within the signalling
   and routing protocols used in optical networking, future needs wonÆt
   be covered by the current developments.

   The main objective of this memo is to include within the LSP
   connection services provided currently when using GMPLS-based
   signalling and routing protocols, the following connections
   services: the Virtual Private optical Network (VPoN), the Class-of-
   Service (CoS), Waveband and Optical Multicast connection services.
   Such services are really the ones (additional services can be
   defined in the future) that will provide added value comparing to
   the current situation in traditional optical networks.

   In order to structure the integration of these services within the
   signalling and routing protocols, we propose to separate the types
   of information enabling the optical network to provide these
   services. For an optical network controlled through a distributed
   IP-based control plane optical sub-network we suggest here to
   differentiate the identification and connection service information
   available on each Optical LSR (OLSR) from the centralized
   information (for instance, related to the network policy) available
   through directory services. This means that we consider for
   scalability, convergence and performance reasons that keeping all
   the policy-related parameters would result in an overflow of
   information to be distributed throughout the optical network giving
   rise to an increasing convergence time of the optical network
   routing database.


2. Optical Networks Foundation


   This section briefly describes two examples of widely used optical
   technologies that can provide enhanced LSP Services through the use
   of an IP-based distributed control plane (such as the one defined by
   the Generalized MPLS protocol suite) with a Domain Service Model.
   The latter in described in section 2.2.

2.1 Transport Technologies for Optical Networking

   The Optical Transport Network (OTN) defined in G.872 [ITUT-G872] and
   G.709 [ITUT-G709] enables optical transmission of various client
   signal types through the use of Forward Error Correction (FEC)
   bytes. ITU-T G.872 defines a functional architecture for an optical

draft-papadimitriou-enhanced-lsps-04.txt                     July 2001

   transport network that supports the transport of digital client
   signals. ITU-T G.709 recommendation specifies the data plane
   transport structure and allocates overhead bytes for the OTN control
   plane. It defines the digital path structure to be transported into
   optical channels.

   In the below sub-sections section, we describe shortly the G.709
   Digital and Optical Transport Hierarchies (OTH) defined at the ITU-
   T. This by taking into account that today the most widely deployed
   legacy transmission networks (in particular in Wide Area Networks -
   WAN) are based on SDH and SONET. More details on OTN and Pre-OTN
   developments can be found in [G709-FRM].

2.1.1 Pre-OTN DWDM Development

   ITU-T G.709 describes pre-OTN development (also referred to as DWDM
   development) for backward compatibility with the current DWDM system
   deployment. Pre-OTN DWDM systems (which were not defined at the ITU
   prior to the G.709 recommendation) have been developed during the
   last years in order to overcome the bandwidth limitations and
   increase the bit-rate per fiber until several Tbps per fiber. In the
   future, pre-OTN DWDM systems will provide up to hundred of
   wavelengths per fiber.

   These developments include the definition of point-to-point DWDM
   optical channels on top of a mesh optical topology including Optical
   Cross-Connects (OXC) or Photonic Cross-Connects (PXC). A PXC is
   defined as an all-optical device (i.e. no O/E/O interface
   conversion) so that 1R optical amplification can be provided by such
   interfaces. Conversely, an OXC is defined as a non-transparent
   device providing O/E/O conversion at each interface (also referred
   to as 3R for Reamplification, Reshaping and Retiming) such devices
   are capable to switch a whole STM-N/OC-N signal or MSn/STS-N signal.
   Thus the Regenerator Section or the Multiplex Section is
   respectively terminated (at least for certain overhead bytes) by the
   switch interfaces. This means that such devices donÆt provide the
   so-called VC-4/STS-1 SPE re-grooming capability. On the contrary, an
   Opaque OXC is defined in the scope of this document as a VC-4/STS-1
   SPE SDH/Sonet cross-connect, which is therefore strictly equivalent
   to a DXC with optical transceivers on its line interfaces.

   The current bandwidth bottleneck is overcome by the use of DWDM
   systems. Today, DWDM systems allow the multiplexing of more than 160
   wavelengths of 10 Gbps (1.6 Tbps per fiber with a 25 GHz spacing)
   using the C-band and the L-band. Recent optical technology
   improvements enable channel spacing of 12.5 GHz for 2.5 Gbps
   signals. Consequently, it will be possible to house 320 wavelengths
   of 2.5 Gbps in a single fiber. A complementary method for increasing
   the effective capacity of a DWDM system is to include the 1480nm
   (Short Band) and 1650nm (Ultra-Long Band) bands by providing fibers
   covering ultra-wide optical bands from 1460 to 1675nm.

   In the pre-OTN application, client signals are either directly
   mapped on the wavelength (i.e. optical channel) or mapped through by
   using an intermediate mapping-framing variable-length layer also
   referred to as a digital wrapper layer. The former direct mapping is
   defined for STM-N/OC-N (and Gigabit Ethernet) client signal while
   the latter is mainly used for packet client layers such as IP and
   ATM. This means that such developments do not include G.709 client-
   signal mapping specification through the definition of a dedicated
   framing procedure. Moreover, additional standard Transparency levels
   to the one defined for SONET/SDH networks can be specified for Pre-
   OTN networks.

2.1.2 Optical Transport Networks (OTN)

   Optical networks comprise a set of functionality providing
   transport, multiplexing, routing, supervision and survivability of
   client signals that are processed predominantly in the optical
   domain. Optical signals are characterized by wavelength and may be
   processed per wavelength or as a wavelength division multiplexed
   group of wavelengths.

   The OTN model is decomposed into independent (transport) network
   layers where each layer can be separately partitioned in a way that
   reflects its internal structure. Thus, the OTN model refers to a
   layered structure comprising a Digital and an Optical Transport
   Hierarchy (OTH).

   The development of a digital and an optical transport hierarchy
   (i.e. networking layer) is required for the following reasons:
   - It is the next step (after TDM - SDH/SONET) to support ever
     growing data driven needs for bandwidth and emergence of new
     broadband services
   - To support next generation Terabit/second per fiber via DWDM lines
     at the transport level as well as optical channels at 2.5 Gbps, 10
     Gbps and 40 Gbps bit rates at wire speed level (and in the future
     160 Gbps currently under definition)
   - To provide network operational management, planning,
     administration, survivability, and finally cost of maintenance
     limited only to the OTUk/ODUk rates of transmission without caring
     about the granularity of the client signal.

   In the optical domain, the following network layers are currently
   defined, they constitute the Optical Transport Hierarchy:
   - Optical Transmission Section (OTS) layer: This network layer
     provides functionality for transmission of optical signals on
     optical media of various types. This layer ensures the integrity
     and maintenance of the optical transmitted signal by overhead
     processing.
   - Optical Multiplex Section (OMS) layer: This network layer provides
     functionality for networking of a multi-wavelength optical signal.
     A "multi-wavelength" signal includes the case of just one optical
     channel. This layer ensures the integrity and maintenance of the

draft-papadimitriou-enhanced-lsps-04.txt                     July 2001

     multi-wavelength signal by overhead processing.
   - Optical Channel (OCh) layer: this network layer provides end-to-
     end networking of optical channels for transparently conveying
     client information of various formats (e.g. SDH STM-N, Sonet OC-N,
     ATM, IP, etc.). The capabilities of this network layer concern
     connection re-arrangement for flexible routing, overhead
     processing, administration and maintenance functions.

   For the three layers specified above, non-associated overhead is
   transported via the Optical Supervisory Channel (OSC) in order to
   manage the optical connectivity. It has to be noted that these three
   layers are common to both pre-OTN and OTN applications.

   As far as the client signal handling is concerned, the Digital
   Wrapper layer is further layered as follows:
   - The Optical Channel Transport Unit (OTUk) provides FEC
     capabilities and optical section protection and monitoring
     capabilities.
   - The Optical Channel Data Unit (ODUk) layer provides client
     independent connectivity, connection protection and monitoring
     (also without the need to terminate the overhead information,
     the ODUk overhead may be monitored non-intrusively).
   - Clients signals i.e. STM-N signals, IP packets, ATM cells and
     Ethernet frames are mapped (meaning digitally wrapped) into a new
     structured frame defined as Optical Channel Payload Unit (OPUk).

   For each of the three layers specified above, an associated (in-
   band) overhead carrying the management information is added inside
   the framed structure itself. Notice, that only the ODUk (k= 1, 2, 3)
   and OCh are defined today as networking layers. The OPUk, ODUk and
   OTUk layers constitute the Digital Transport Hierarchy also referred
   to as the Digital Wrapper Layer.

2.2 Service Models for Optical Networking

   Two service models are generally considered for the services at the
   boundary between distinct administrative entities (sometimes
   corresponding to separate technological domain or clouds): the
   domain service and the unified service model. The former is largely
   covered in [GMPLS-ARCH] and [IPO-FRM] while the latter is discussed
   more extensively in this section in particular from the connection
   service perspective.

   Under the domain service model, the transport network primarily
   offers high bandwidth connectivity in the form of Lambda Switched
   LSP (L-LSP). The client LSR when requesting the following connection
   services uses standardized signalling protocols across the domain
   service interface: LSP creation/deletion/modification (non-
   disruptive) and status enquiry. Moreover LSP tracing from the source
   to the destination (as provided today by a TraceRoute function in
   the IP domain) or simply ICMP-like commands must be provided to the
   client LSR in order to check the integrity of the connections.
   Remember here that LSPs are non-packet LSPs meaning that under
   definition MPLS (tunnel) tracing methods are not applicable as such
   to verify the status of a connection.

   An end-system discovery procedure (also referred to as neighbor
   discovery) may be used over the boundary interface (the domain
   service interface) to verify local port connectivity between the
   optical network and client LSR. Finally, a service discovery
   procedure can be executed to obtain details about the connection
   services offered by the optical network. The protocol (or
   extensions) defined for neighbor discovery purposes are different
   from the signaling protocol itself. They can be implemented for
   instance through the use of LMP (see [MPLS-LMP]) or BGP (see [RFC-
   1771]).

   The set of connection services is offered across the domain service
   interface such that the signaling protocol must provide a few
   messages with certain edge-to-edge dedicated attributes only
   significant between the client LSR and the optical network. Such a
   protocol can be based on RSVP-TE [MPLS-RSVP] or CR-LDP [MPLS-LDP] as
   defined today in [GMPLS-SIG] extended to RSVP-TE [GMPLS-RSVP] and
   CR-LDP [GMPLS-CRLDP].

   The domain services model does not deal with the type and nature of
   routing protocols within the optical network. However, the use of an
   IGP routing protocol extended to include Traffic-Engineering
   attributes such as [GMPLS-OSPF-TE] and [GMPLS-ISIS-TE] is certainly
   the best solution. Furthermore, the integration of multiple, sub-
   networks across inter-domain interface could require the
   specification of extensions to inter-domain routing protocols such
   as BGP. The domain services model would then result in the

   establishment of an LSP topology (in the context of this memo,
   Lambda-LSP and Fiber-LSP) and between client LSRs located at the
   edge of the optical network.


3. Connection Identification


   The connection services provided by the optical network are closely
   related to the connection end-point identification. The following
   LSR interface (referred here to as non-PSC interface) identification
   parameters are considered from the client and network perspective.


3.1 Client and Optical LSR Interfaces


   An Optical LSR (OLSR) refers to either an Optical Cross-Connect
   (OXC) or a Photonic Cross-Connect (PXC) while a Client LSR refers
   usually to a router, an SDH/Sonet or an OXC. In the context of this
   memo and as usually agreed an OXC is defined as an O-E-O capable
   device while a PXC is defined as an O-O capable device.

3.1.1 Non-PSC Interfaces

   Optical and Client LSRs include devices where the forwarding
   decision is based on time slots, wavelengths, or physical ports. So,
   the set of Optical LSRs interfaces is defined as including the
   following classes of interfaces in addition to the Packet Switch
   Capable (PSC) interfaces and Layer-2 Switch Capable (L2SC)
   interfaces:

   - Time-Division Multiplex Capable (TDM) interfaces:

     Interfaces that forward data based on the data's time slot in a
     repeating cycle. Such interfaces belong mainly to SDH/SONET
     Cross-Connect (XC), Add-Drop Multiplexer (ADM) and G.709 Cross-
     Connect (operating at the Digital Transport Layer).

   - Lambda Switch Capable (LSC) interfaces:

     Interfaces that forward data based on the wavelength on which the
     data is received. Such interfaces belong mainly to Photonic Cross-
     Connect (PXC), Optical Cross-Connect (OXC) and G.709 Cross-Connect
     operating at the optical channel layer.

   - Fiber-Switch Capable (FSC) interfaces:

     Interfaces that forward data based on a position of the data in
     the real world physical spaces. Such interfaces belong mainly to
     (Multi-Service) Cross-Connects capable to switch the content of a
     whole fiber.

   To each of these interface types corresponds a Label Switched

   Path (LSP) type. Consequently, the following LSP types are defined:
   TDM-LSP, Lambda-LSP (L-LSP) and Fiber LSP (F-LSP). LSPs can be
   established only between, or through, interfaces of the same type.

   The concept of nested LSP (LSP within LSP) facilitates building of
   an LSP hierarchy. This hierarchy of LSPs can occur on the same
   interface or between different interfaces. Therefore nesting can
   also occur between interfaces belonging to distinct layers. The
   following diagram illustrates the LSP nesting concept and the LSP
   hierarchy.

   Needless to say, that this memo is mainly focused on Lambda-LSP (L-
   LSP) services either standard (G.709 OTN based) or non-standard
   (including pre-OTN developments).

3.1.2 Non-PSC Interfaces Address Space

   We consider here that any transport and control addressing scheme
   uses IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses. Other categories of addressing
   schemes such as NSAP are not considered in this memo. This because
   as described in [GMPLS-ARCH], it would imply a modification of the
   already existing signaling and routing protocols (included in the
   Generalized MPLS protocol suite) that uses IPv4 and/or IPv6
   addresses.

   The fact that IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses are the only considered
   doesn't imply at all that they should be allocated in the same
   addressing space than public IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses used for the
   Internet.

draft-papadimitriou-enhanced-lsps-04.txt                     July 2001

   Each network layer could have a different administrative authority
   responsible for address allocation and re-using the full addressing
   space, completely independently though this does not seem to be the
   most efficient way to allocate and manage the address space(s).
   While private IP addresses can be used if they don't require to be
   exchanged with any other operator, public IP addresses are otherwise
   required.

   As part of the Domain Service Model and as described in [IPO-RTG],
   reachability information exchange through the Domain Service
   interface, using eBGP protocol for instance, is considered as a must
   within the scope of this document.

3.1.3 Non-PSC Interface Identifier Space

   The following parameters are related to the physical-level
   interfaces identification of Client and Optical LSR. Identifier
   space value is purely local to each node. Therefore these values are
   not used for routing purposes:

   - Port ID: integer indicating and identifying a port within an
     Optical LSR (OLSR)

   - Channel ID: integer indicating and identifying a channel (i.e. a
     wavelength) within a given port ID

   - Logical-port ID: identifies a logical port whose identifier is
     defined as the concatenation of the Port ID and the Channel-ID.

   These definitions can be extended to identify the client network
   element (client LSR) interfaces also simply referred to as LSR
   interfaces.

3.2 Optical Network Identification

   The optical network identification parameters can be defined, as a
   Carrier Identifier (Carrier ID) is an integer defining the identity
   of the carrier to which the OLSR element belongs.

   The Carrier ID uniquely determines the owner of a signalling message
   when travelling over inter-domain interface signalling channels
   between optical networks. Typically the Carrier ID will be assigned
   to the BGP AS number (2 bytes).

   This identifier is provisioned by the administrative authority of
   the optical network and can be exchanged during the neighbor
   discovery process or any other inter-domain routing protocol
   exchange such as BGP [RFC-1771].


3.3 Client Network identification

draft-papadimitriou-enhanced-lsps-04.txt                     July 2001

   The client network identification parameters include additionally to
   the Client LSR logical-port ID, the Client Network Identifier
   (Client Network ID) and the VPN Identifier (VPN ID):

   - Client Network ID: identifier uniquely defining a client network
     (or a group of client LSR belonging to the same administrative
     authority) with respect to a given optical network domain.

     This parameter should not have any complex semantic nor meaning
     and could be useful when considering optical broadcast and
     multicast applications. The Client Network ID (or simply Client-
     ID) will be typically the BGP AS number (2 bytes) of the client
     Network or simply the Client device Node ID (for instance, an IPv4
     loopback address taken from the public IPv4 address space).

   - VPN ID: VPN identifiers as defined in [RFC-2685]

     The VPN ID is equivalent to the VPoN ID (Virtual Private optical
     Network), however since the corresponding model does not apply
     only to optical networks but also to SDH/SONET or any kind of
     ôlayeredö transport network, we donÆt refer to VPoN identifiers in
     this document. 

     In absence of a centralized network authority, the source and
     destination OLSR are responsible for authentication of VPN IDs and
     for call acceptance policies. In the absence of a pre-determined
     policy, the default behavior is for the destination client LSR to
     accept the LSP create request if the destination client LSR is
     part of the signaled and authenticated VPoN.

     Since a boundary OLSR can potentially be connected to multiple
     client LSR, or a given client LSR can potentially request LSP
     for several VPoNs, this identifier defines the possibility to
     setup Virtual Private optical Networks (VPoN). The corresponding
     models are described in Section 3.4.

     The association of the client source address (and by extension the
     OLSR address) with the logical-port ID (LPID) is used in the
     context of the VPoN model. This implies the VPoNs services are
     defined at the optical channel level and not only at the port
     level meaning that the granularity of the VPoN can be finer than
     the one classically defined for the so-called layer-1 VPNs.

     The association of an (Client or OLSR) address and an LPID
     <Address;LPID> is referred to as a connection termination-point
     identifier (CTID). Typically, the Client and OLSR address space is
     IPv4. Mappings between Client and OLSR termination point
     identifier [<Client Address;LPID>;<OLSR Address;LPID>] are then
     associated through the domain service interface signalling to the
     VPN ID to which the LSP connection requests refers. The ingress
     (and egress) OLSR need only to maintain a mapping table where this
     information is stored per VPN ID. This approach easily provides

     VPoN service to the client network.

3.4 VPoN Model

   The VPoN - Virtual Private optical Network model considered here are
   based on the following concepts:
      - the Client ID defines the identification of an optical network
        client (for instance, an ISP)
      - the VPN ID defines the identification of a group defined
        within this optical network client (for instance an ISP client)

   The first model considers the Client ID as a VPoN identifier in
   addition to the VPN ID while the second one considers only the VPN
   ID as a VPoN identifier.

   If we consider the Client ID as a VPoN identifier, then the
   following alternative could be considered:
      - isolation of the resources within a given VPoN (for instance, a
        given ISP client)
      - isolation of the resources between VPoNs within a given Client-
        ID (for instance, between ISP clients belonging to the same
        ISP)
      - no-isolation of the resources i.e. sharing of the resource
        between clients within the optical network

   In this example, the optical network has several clients (i.e. ISPs
   identified by a unique Client ID) and each of the optical network
   clients has several clients (i.e. ISP clients identified by a unique
   VPN ID).

   If we only consider the VPN ID as a VPoN identifier, then the
   following alternative could be considered:
      - isolation of the resources within a given VPoN (for instance, a
        given ISP)
      - no-isolation of the resources i.e. sharing of the resource
        between VPoNs within the optical network

   In this example, the optical network has several clients (i.e. ISPs
   identified by a unique VPN ID) and there is no dependence of the
   isolation regarding the owner of the VPoN.

   If we consider a unique address space per optical network, it means
   that any address belonging to any VPoN must be unique. Otherwise, if
   we consider on address space per VPoN (for instance, per Client ID),
   then the address uniqueness is limited to this VPoN.

   As specified in [RFC-2685], a VPoN may use a private address space,
   which may overlap with the address space of another VPN or the
   Internet public networks. A VPoN may span multiple optical domains
   (BGP AS) meaning that an IP address only has meaning within the VPN
   in which it exists.  For this reason, it is necessary to identify
   the VPoN in which a particular address space is meaningful. Note

Papadimitriou et al.     Expires January 2002                       11


draft-papadimitriou-enhanced-lsps-04.txt                     July 2001

   also that [RFC-2685] recognized the advantage of identifying any
   particular VPoN at any layer and at any location in which it exists
   using ideally the same VPoN identifier.

   Consequently, the case with address space uniqueness per VPoN is
   most flexible since it permits to connect clients having overlapping
   address spaces. However, this also requires for the optical network
   to maintain a mapping table per VPN ID.


4. Optical Connection Services


   Optical Connection Services include LSP Connection Services, LSP
   Protection and LSP Routing.


4.1 Basic LSP Connection Services

   Basic LSP connection services are provided through the exchange of
   the parameters considered within this sub-section. They offer the
   possibility to implement the basic connection (i.e. LSP) service
   requests through the domain service interface. These parameters are
   mainly the framing, the bandwidth, the directionality and the
   network protection level.

4.1.1 Framing

   The Framing parameter specifies the encoding format of the signal
   for the requested connection. The Framing represents the networking
   layer at which the requested connection will operate throughout the
   optical network.

   The Framing-type (referred to as LSP Encoding Type in [GMPLS-SIG])
   for LSP established throughout an optical network could be one of
   the following:
      - Ethernet: LAN Ethernet (LAN PHY) and WAN Ethernet (WAN PHY)
      - TDM: SDH (ITU-T G.707) and SONET (ANSI T1.105)
      - Digital Wrapper: ITU-T G.709 Digital Path and Proprietary
      - Optical: ITU-T G.709 Optical Channels and Non-standard Lambda

4.1.2 Bandwidth

   The Bandwidth values are defined with respect to the Framing-type.
   Signal Types extend bandwidth values since the latter can take only
   discrete values for non-packet LSP: TDM-LSP (i.e. SDH/SONET LSP), L-
   LSP (i.e. G.709 Optical Channel LSP). We refer here to [GMPLS-SIG],
   [GSMPL-SDH] and [GMPLS-G709] for more details concerning the Signal
   Types definition and their respective value space for SDH/SONET and
   G.709 OTN.

4.1.3 Directionality




Papadimitriou et al.     Expires January 2002                       12


draft-papadimitriou-enhanced-lsps-04.txt                     July 2001

   As described in [GMPLS-SIG], bi-directionality of an LSP is defined
   by the use of an upstream label within the LSP create request.

4.1.4 Network Protection

   Signalling the network protection requested for an L-LSP can be
   performed in two ways: either explicitly or implicitly.

   1. Explicit Protection indication

   The Protection parameter specifies the protection level desired for
   the requested LSP inside the optical network (i.e. internal network
   protection). Notice that protection at the domain service interface
   (source- and destination-side protection) levels is not covered
   since the domain service model implies that the protection of the L-
   LSP initiated by the client is up to the corresponding networking
   layer. The corresponding LSP nesting can be illustrated as follows:

                  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
                  +                            +
        C1 ----------- N1 ----- N2 ----- N3 ------------ C2
         |  -> A  +    |      /    \      |    +  -> A   |
         |        +    |    /        \    |    +         |
         |        +    |  /            \  |    +         |
          ------------ N4 -------------- N5 -------------
            -> B  +                            +  -> B
                  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

   Protection at the Network layer:
   - Client Request: C1 to C2 Protected LSP
   - Network Request: Primary LSP using [N1 û N2 û N3]
                      Secondary LSP using [N1 û N4 û N5 û N3]

   Protection at the Client layer:
   - Client Request: C1 to C2 LSP (Primary LSP) through path A
   - Client Request: C1 to C2 LSP (Secondary LSP) through path B

   Several network protection services (or network edge-to-edge LSP
   protection) can be defined:
       - Extra-Traffic (preemptable)
       - Unprotected (default value)
       - Re-routing (path-level edge-to-edge restoration)
       - Multi-Group Shared Protection M:N (particular case 1:N)
       - Group Shared Protection M:N (particular case 1:N)
       - Dedicated 1:1 Protection
       - Dedicated 1+1 Protection
       - Enhanced Protection (ring-based protection)

   Related to these protection types and levels, a reversion strategy
   could be defined:
       - a revertive strategy means that a LSP gets restored
         to its original route after a failure has been recovered (or

Papadimitriou et al.     Expires January 2002                       13


draft-papadimitriou-enhanced-lsps-04.txt                     July 2001

         restored)
       - a non-revertive strategy means that a LSP does not
         get restored to its original route after a failure has been
         recovered (or restored)

   The network protection mechanisms are extensively detailed in [IPO-
   RES] together with the required signalling protocol extensions.
   Enhanced protection (i.e. ring-based protection) concepts and
   mechanisms are detailed in [IPO-RFR].

   2. Implicit Protection indication

   There is another way to specify within a connection service request
   the protection level desired; this by indicating the Class of
   Service to which the requested LSP belongs. The Class-of-Services
   (CoS) are detailed in section 5.4.

4.2 Pre-OTN Connection Service

   Pre-OTN LSPs are also referred to as optical SDH/SONET connections.
   Since the SDH/SONET parameters applies only to SDH/SONET framing
   (i.e. LSP Encoding Type), Pre-OTN connection service includes the
   Transparency levels supported by the optical non-transparent network.

   Transparency levels currently supported in such optical networks
   are:
      - Path OH transparency: the network can transparently
        transport HOVC/STS-SPE connections (in that case the
        corresponding LSP is equivalent to a TDM-LSP)
      - Multiplex Section/Line OH (MSOH/LOH) Transparency: the network
        can transparently transport MSn/STS-N connections
      - Regenerator Section/Section OH (RSOH/SOH) Transparency: the
        network can transparently transport STM-N/OC-N connections
        (such transparency service is supported by default throughout
        G.709 OTN networks)

   Semi-transparent levels can also be defined with respect to the
   Client Signal; in that case, the network transparency levels are
   referred to as OverHead tunneling levels:
      - Specific MSOH/LOH bytes Transparency such as MS/Line DCC (D4
        - D12) or K1/K2 bytes: the network can non transparently
        transport MSn/STS-N connections while keeping the MS/Line DCC
        or other MSOH/LOH bytes unchanged
      - Specific RSOH/SOH bytes Transparency such as RS/Section DCC (D1
        û D3) or J0 bytes: the network can non transparently
        transport MSn/STS-N connections while keeping the MS/Line DCC
        or other MSOH/LOH bytes unchanged

   Such transparency service provides for instance in-fiber/in-band
   signalling transport mechanism across the optical network for
   SDH/SONET client networks. Consequently, the optical network does

draft-papadimitriou-enhanced-lsps-04.txt                     July 2001

   not use anymore the corresponding MSOH/LOH and/or RSOH/SOH overhead
   bytes to provide its internal signalling transport mechanism.

4.3 OTN Connection Service

   As described in Section 2.1 based, the OTN connection service is
   based on the G.709 specification [ITUT-G709]. However, today most of
   the client LSR interfaces donÆt support G.709 specification (in
   particular when client LSR are routers) so that at the domain
   service interface client-to-network interconnection is provided
   through the use of Pre-OTN interfaces supporting STM-N/OC-N signals.
   The client signal is terminated at the ingress Optical LSR (OLSR)
   and then either tunneled or simply continued within the optical
   network.

   This suggests the definition of an interworking function OTN<->Pre-
   OTN at the Domain Service Interface (i.e. ingress and egress OLSR).

   GMPLS Signalling for OTN connection service is defined in [GMPLS-
   G709]. Such service provides also the full transparency of the
   client signal (see Section 4.2).

4.4 All-Optical Connection Service

   The distinction between the OTN and the All-Optical connection
   service is made for the following reasons. First the OTN compliance
   refer to an Optical Transport Hierarchy (OTH) as described in [G709-
   FRM]. Then, OTN compliance implies the implementation of intra-
   domain optical signal control and monitoring capabilities through a
   specific implementation of the control plane using non-associated
   overhead at the OTH level.

   Therefore, the optical signal control and monitoring capabilities
   can be provided either by using the G.709 non-associated OverHead
   (naOH) through the Optical Supervisory Channel (OSC) or by using
   non-standardized methods. The latter refers to methods using
   technology such as optical signal Sub-Carrier Multiplexing (SCM).
   More details about this technology are available in [IPO-SCM].

4.4.1 All-optical Connection Service - Overview

   When considering a Domain Service Model, the key issue concerning
   all-optical connection service is that the client optical signal
   must be terminated at the ingress AND at the egress of the optical
   domain (which includes only PXC nodes except at the edge interfaces
   toward the client network). Otherwise, it would be impossible for
   the optical network to control and monitor the connection service
   provided to the client network. This independently to the fact that
   the client LSR interfaces must be either colored otherwise
   wavelength conversion has to be provided at the ingress of the
   optical network.

draft-papadimitriou-enhanced-lsps-04.txt                     July 2001

   The alternative is to provide all-optical connection services from
   the source to the destination client network without terminating the
   optical channel at the ingress and egress of the network. However,
   such approach requires providing to the client LSR an access to the
   optical control plane since clients nodes must now have the
   capability to perform their own L-LSP connection management. This
   would in turn require the definition of Virtual Private control
   Networks (VPcN) in order to guarantee some privacy. Notice here the
   difference between a VPoN and VPcN: the VPoN is a private network
   defined at the transport plane level while the VPcN is defined at
   the control plane level.

4.4.2 All-Optical Connection Parameters

   These parameters are related to all-optical networking connection
   services. These parameters can be sub-divided into two groups.
   First, the ones used to monitor the optical signal quality such as
   the Bit Error Rate (BER). Then, the optical parameters used for
   optical routing purposes (commonly referred to as optical routing
   impairments) such as the Optical Signal-to-Noise Ratio (OSNR),
   Polarization Mode Dispersion (PMD).

   The optical signal performance monitoring is achieved by measuring
   (through methods not defined in this document) the BER. As
   parameters, the BER is defined the exponent of the maximum BER
   admitted for a given optical signal (default value is zero). Real-
   time measurements allow performing signal quality monitoring and
   therefore on-line measurements. In turn, this method enables to
   determine whether or not the current optical signal quality meets
   the optical connection Service Level Specification (SLS).

   Concerning optical routing impairments, linear parameters such as
   Optical SNR (OSNR) and Polarization Mode Dispersion (PMD) are
   considered in [IPO-ORI] for sub-optimal optical routing. Amplified
   Spontaneous Emission (ASE) influence the Optical SNR (OSNR), which
   determines an upper bound to the maximum number of spans that an L-
   LSP can traverse. The PMD determines an upper bound to the maximum
   optical span length that an L-LSP can traverse. More details about
   optical routing linear impairments can be additionally found in
   [IEEE-ORL]. Nevertheless, these linear parameters constitutes a
   subset of the optical routing impairments that have to be considered
   for Long Haul optical transmission (> 2000 km). We refer to [IPO-
   NLRI], where non-linear optical routing impairments are considered.

   For non-transparent optical transport networks, one has to take into
   account the Jitter parameter in addition to the Bit Error Rate
   (BER). This parameter is defined as the maximum jitter admitted for
   a given optical signal (default value is zero) also referred to as
   Jitter Tolerance. There are currently three types of jitter
   specifications:
      - jitter tolerance: the peak-to-peak amplitude of sinusoidal
        jitter applied on the input signal that causes a 1dB power

        penalty
      - jitter generation: the process whereby jitter appears at the
        output port û transmission û in absence of input jitter
      - jitter transfer: a measure of the quantity of input jitter
        attenuation with respect to the output signal

5. Enhanced Optical Connection Services

   This section covers the connection services such as Optical
   Multicast, Waveband Switching, Optical Class-of-Services and VPoN
   services.

5.1 Multicast Service

   Today, as described in [GMPLS-SIG], an LSP request can translate
   either a unidirectional unicast connection or a bi-directional
   unicast connection. Optical multicast connection service provides
   the capability to establish point-to-multipoint LSPs throughout the
   optical network. In this case, the ingress client and optical LSR
   could have many destinations in common therefore reducing the number
   of wavelengths used per fiber link. Optical multicast is detailed in
   [IPO-OMF] as well as the related signalling considerations. We
   briefly summarize here the rationale and key associated concepts.

   The optical multicast concept can be applied to numerous client-
   layer applications covering mainly Optical Broadband applications,
   Multimedia, Video and HDTV.

   When extended to the optical domain, the multicast concept offers
   the following advantages:
      - Efficient optical 1+1 (dedicated) protection
      - Improved performance (no store and forward) compared to packet-
        oriented multicast technology
      - Overall network throughput improvement by reducing the number
        of wavelengths used per fiber link (i.e. minimizing the overall
        bandwidth usage per fiber link)
      - Reduction of the total number of transceivers in all-
        optical networks.

   However, the major drawback to overcome in optical multicast-capable
   networks is to compensate the power penalty introduced during the
   optical signal splitting. Moreover, the multicast problem in
   communication networks is NP-Complete (since described by the
   Steiner Tree Problem applied to communication networks).

   [IPO-OMF] also extensively details the diverse possibilities that
   can be considered to extend the currently defined (or under-
   definition) multicast signalling protocols.

5.2 Waveband Switching Service



Papadimitriou et al.     Expires January 2002                       17


draft-papadimitriou-enhanced-lsps-04.txt                     July 2001

   Waveband Switching refers to the switching of a non-contiguous set
   of identical optical channels which are to be routed, switched and
   protected as an individual entity. This service can be useful for
   inverse multiplexing where high bandwidth client signal is
   partitioned into multiple lower rate optical channels. For instance
   a 10 Gbps client signal partitioned into four 2.5 Gbps optical
   channels. It is desirable that each optical channel use the same
   physical resources, with identical propagation delay (if O/E/O
   conversion is needed) and protection schemes, thus minimizing the
   segmentation and reassembly within the client domain.

   Waveband Switching underlying concepts are extensively covered in
   [IPO-WBS] where we demonstrate the benefits from the introduction in
   optical networks of the optical multi-granularity concept.

   LetÆs briefly examine the key drivers and advantages provided by the
   waveband switching services. Today, optical switches are able to
   handle different switching granularities from wavelength to fiber
   and especially wavebands. Taking benefits from these technologies,
   switching larger granularities reduce at the same time the
   complexity of control operations, the amount of hardware in the
   optical layer, and in addition relax some physical constraints.
   Gains expected from the approach are partly function of the
   efficiency of the grooming of wavelengths into larger granularities.
   In particular, intelligent intermediate grooming makes the multi-
   granularity concept even more attractive since reducing the required
   size of optical switching matrix typically by a factor of two or
   more.

   Optical switching allows the transmission capacity of point to point
   links to scale up to the predicted traffic requirements of multiple
   Tbps. Hence the switching capacity of backbone nodes has to scale up
   to thousands of Wavelength Switching Capable (WBSC) interfaces. To
   overcome the bottleneck of electronic switching, wavelength cross-
   connects have been introduced.

   Optical switching can also be extended to switch larger
   granularities such as bands of wavelengths (also referred to as
   wavebands) and fibers (also referred to as spatial switching). By
   considering that optical networks will not experience a significant
   evolution of their topology properties (connectivity, number of
   nodes), these new granularities will easily support the traffic
   growth with limited impact on efficiency.

   Therefore, the main issue is to find the optimum way to arrange the
   spatial distribution of traffic flows on the topology in order to
   create connections at the different optical granularities (i.e.
   different LSP bandwidth). The intrinsic properties of a typical
   backbone network give us good perspectives to achieve the goal of
   dynamically creating LSPs at these granularities. The relatively
   limited number of nodes (tens of nodes) and the relative small
   connectivity (3 to 8 neighbors per node) allow us to assume that

Papadimitriou et al.     Expires January 2002                       18


draft-papadimitriou-enhanced-lsps-04.txt                     July 2001

   there will be a strong correlation between flows of traffic inside
   the network.

   In other terms, it means that, assuming an efficient planning,
   numerous flows (e.g. STM-N/OC-N or IP flows) have to be processed in
   the same way in the nodes. Thus, this should give the opportunity to
   establish wavelength, waveband and fiber connections, and process
   most of the traffic using optical granularities as large as
   possible. This will alleviate some capacity bottlenecks and above
   all reduce the network cost.

   In [IPO-WBS], we propose to use this concept of multiple optical
   granularities in association with grooming strategies and GMPLS
   integration requirements. Among possible optical switching
   granularities, waveband is an attractive trade-off for foreseen
   traffic volumes in next few years and will be particularly
   considered in the following.

   For this purpose, waveband-switching layer is introduced as an
   additional sub-layer between the Lambda and the Fiber layer i.e.
   between corresponding Lambda-LSP (wavelength switching) and Fiber-
   LSP (spatial switching). However, this sub-layer does not introduce
   either a new type of interface or a new class of Forwarding
   Adjacencies (FA) class since we consider a Lambda LSP (L-LSP) as a
   particular case of a more generic Waveband-LSP (WB-LSP).

   In terms of grooming strategies, we also propose to have both end-
   to-end and intermediate grooming at waveband and fiber levels to
   make the concept more attractive. Intermediate grouping is referred
   to as the aggregation of traffic with different source nodes and/or
   different destination nodes but with a common sub-path at the
   optical layer. End-to-end grooming (i.e. between source and
   destination OLSR) is a particular case of intermediate grooming
   where the sub-path in the optical layer is the entire Lambda-LSP (L-
   LSP) between source and destination OLSR.

5.3 Priority-Preemption

   The priority-preemption is a service offering prioritization of the
   connection requested during the LSP setup with respect to the
   provisioned priorities of the optical network resources (links,
   paths, etc.). Then the priority of the connection is used to define
   a preemptability level of the connection with respect to the setup
   and/or recovery of other LSPs already provisioned or dynamically
   established within the optical network.

5.3.1 Priority

  The Priority specification (as described in [MPLS-CRLDP] for
  instance) includes the setup and the hold priority. The priority
  field is defined as an (8-bit) integer indicating the priority of the
  requested L-LSP:

      - Priorities from 0x<C>0 is reserved

   Where <C> (4 MS bits) defines the priority-class: C ranges from 1 to
   E Class 1 is considered as the default class and Class 0 and Class F
   are reserved priority-classes. The priority value (4 LS bits) within
   a given priority-class ranges from 0xE (higher priority) to 0x1
   (lower priority).

5.3.2 Preemption

   Preemption is defined as a (4-bit) integer indicating the
   preemptability behavior of an L-LSP. This parameter specifies
   whether a given LSP can be preempted by a L-LSP of higher priority
   if the resource used by the lower-priority L-LSP need to be used
   during the setup and/or the recovery of this higher priority L-LSP.

   The possible values for the preemption behavior can be defined as:
      - Setup and Recovery preemptability: 0x0 (Class 1)
      - Recovery preemptability          : 0x1 (Class 2 to 7)
      - Setup preemptability             : 0x2 (Class 8 to D)
      - No_preemptability                : 0x3 (Class E)

5.4 Class-of-Services

   The Class-of-Services (CoS), described in [IPO-COS] and based on
   [DIFF-ARCH] specification, are build upon the following principle:
   at the (ingress) client LSR, if we consider Packet-Switch
   Capable(PSC) interfaces, the DiffServ Codepoint (DSCP) [DIFF-DSF]
   defining the Per Hop Behaviour (PHB) [DIFF-PHB], are mapped to the
   LSP priority class. For this purpose, we propose the following
   rules:
      - Class 1 corresponds to Best-Effort service
      - Class 2 to D corresponds to Assured Forwarding (AF) services
         . Class AF1 ranges from 2 to 4
         . Class AF2 ranges from 5 to 7
         . Class AF3 ranges from 8 to A
         . Class AF4 ranges from B to D
      - Class E corresponds to Expedited Forwarding (EF) service

   These DiffServ classes are related within the optical network to the
   service-level defined in section 3:
      - Class 1 defines a best-effort service
      - Class 2 to 7 defines a bronze service
      - Class 8 to D defines a silver service
      - Class E defines a gold service

   Within our definition of LSP, the analogy between the drop
   precedence in DiffServ and the priority class could also be related
   to the preemption setting at the domain service interface during the

draft-papadimitriou-enhanced-lsps-04.txt                     July 2001

   LSP creation. In this case, the priority value setting is performed
   through the following rules:
      - Class 1 defines a priority ranging from 0x11 to 0x1E
      - Class 2 to 7 defines a priority ranging from 0x21 to 0x7E
      - Class 8 to D defines a priority ranging from 0x81 to 0xDE
      - Class E defines a priority ranging from 0xE1 to 0xEE

   Application of this model will enable to have a selection mechanism
   at the boundary client LSR (in most of the cases, it will be a
   router) providing LSP multiplexing based on the mapping between the
   DiffServ Code Points (DSCP) and the LSP Class-of-Services provided
   by the optical network. Moreover, this technique enables the direct
   mapping of finer granularity Packet-based LSP to coarser granularity
   L-LSPs without any disruption in the end-to-end QoS offered to the
   client network connections.

5.5 VPoN Service

   The relationship between the Priority/Preemption and the CoS and
   VPoN model is based on the resource isolation concept. Two VPoN
   models have been defined (depending on the usage of the Client ID)
   so that the Priority/Preemption levels considered here are directly
   related to these models and the resource isolation concept.

   If we consider the Client ID as an identifier, then we have the
   following options concerning the preemption levels:
      - preemption within a given VPoN (i.e. within VPoN belonging
       to the same optical network client)
      - preemption within a given Client ID (i.e. between VPoN
        belonging to the same optical network client)
      - preemption between Client IDs (i.e. between optical network
        clients)

   If we do not consider the Client ID as an identifier, then we have
   the following options concerning the preemption levels:
      - preemption within a given VPoN (i.e. within VPoN belonging
        to the same optical network client)
      - preemption between VPoNs (i.e. between VPoN belonging to
        the separate optical network client)

5.6 LSP Monitoring

   TBD.

5.7 LSP Routing Diversity

   From the optical network viewpoint, LSP routing diversity is related
   to the path disjointness provided by the constraint-based route
   computation at the ingress optical LSR. Routing diversity can be
   related to link, node, path and Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG). Here,
   we focus on the disjointness of the LSP explicit route with respect
   to SRLGs.

Papadimitriou et al.     Expires January 2002                       21


draft-papadimitriou-enhanced-lsps-04.txt                     July 2001


   It is commonly admitted [IPO-FRM] that SRLGs identifiers are
   exchanged between nodes belonging to the same optical domain to
   prevent the use of shared resources that can affect all links
   belonging to this group in case of shared resource failure. For
   instance, as described in [IPO-SRLG], two LSPs flowing through the
   same fiber link in the same fiber trunk. The SRLG concept has been
   extended by demonstrating that a given link could belong to more
   than one SRLG, and two links belonging to a given SRLG may
   individually belong to two other SRLGs.

   Many proposals already include the SRLG concept when considering the
   constraint-based path computation of optical channel routes. In
   optical domains this concept of SRLG is used for deriving a path,
   which is disjoint from the physical resource and logical topology
   point-of-view. However, the definition of SRLG in the current format
   as described in [GMPLS-OSPF-TE] and [GMPLS-ISIS-TE] does not
   provide:
      - the relationship between logical structures or physical
        resources (for example, a fiber could be part of a sequence of
        fiber segments, which is included in a given geographical
        region), and
      - the risk assessment during path computation implying the
        allocation of a conditional failure probabilities with the
        SRLGs
      - the analysis of the specifications of constraint-based path
        computation and path re-optimization taking SRLG information
        into account.

   The model proposed in [IPO-SRLG] document proposes a technique to
   compute the SRLG with respect to a given risk type. This is achieved
   by identifying for a given physical layer the resources belonging to
   an SRLG. The proposed model also permits to compute the dependencies
   of these resources into the resources belonging to lower physical
   layers. The result of the computation also enables OLSR to determine
   the risk associated to each of the SRLGs.

   1. Hierarchical Model

   The SRLG model defined in [IPO-SRLG] includes two hierarchies: the
   physical hierarchy and the logical hierarchy.

   The physical hierarchy is related to the fiber topology (more
   generally the physical resources) of the optical network including
   the wavelengths build on top of this physical topology. The network
   (physical) resource model considered in [IPO-SRLG] is based on
   concepts introduced in [IPO-FRM]. The concepts around network
   resource hierarchy developed within this document are based on the
   following components:
      - Sub-Channel (TDM circuit û only applicable for SDH/SONET
        networks)
      - Optical Channel (or Wavelength)

Papadimitriou et al.     Expires January 2002                       22


draft-papadimitriou-enhanced-lsps-04.txt                     July 2001

      - Fiber Link
      - Fiber Segment
      - Fiber Sub-segment
      - Fiber Trunks

   The Logical hierarchy is related to the geographical topology of the
   network. The definition of the logical hierarchical structure covers
   an increasing extended logical structure partitioning of the area
   covered by the optical network. For that purposes the concept of
   node, zone and region are defined in [IPO-SRLG].

   2. Risk Assessment

   Risk assessment is defined as the evaluation of the potential risk
   associated to the inclusion of a given resource (this resource
   belongs to a given resource type located within a given logical
   structure such as a geographical location). Since the SRLG
   computation is performed with respect to a given risk type
   associated to a given network resource, a failure probability is
   assigned to the network resources instances included within the same
   logical structure. So, in the approach described in [IPO-SRLG] there
   is a direct mapping between the risk type and the resource type as
   well as the failure probability associated to this resource type
   within a given logical structure.

   3. Inference Model

   The model described in [IPO-SRLG] is provided to automate the
   discovery of the Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs) at a given layer
   for a given physical resource type. This resource type could be
   located within a given region and OLSR.

   Note however, that in the domain service model, when a client OLSR
   sends an LSP service request it can only reference about the LSPs it
   has already established. Consequently, it can only reference an LSP
   M from which the new LSP N should be diverse. The OLSR will
   interpret this request by considering the Shared Risk Link Group
   (SRLG) of the LSP M and find a physical route for the LSP N whose
   SRLG is diverse from.

   The same process applies at the inter-domain interface where the
   outgoing OLSR (belonging to the BGP AS[i]) does only knows about the
   LSPs he has already established to the incoming OLSR (belonging to
   the BGP AS[j], AS[i] =/= AS[j]). Consequently, the outgoing OLSR can
   only reference an LSP M from which the new LSP N should be diverse.

6. Connection Service Policy

   Policy-related parameters are related to directory services provided
   to the client client LSR through the domain service interface
   services. These parameters include the following items:
      - Service-Level parameters

Papadimitriou et al.     Expires January 2002                       23


draft-papadimitriou-enhanced-lsps-04.txt                     July 2001

      - Schedule parameters
      - Contract parameters
      - Billing parameters
      - Optional parameters

   By receiving such kind of parameters the source boundary OLSR needs
   to forward the content of these request through the NMI interface
   (interface between the OLSR and a management server) to a
   centralized directory service or de-centralized service in
   combination with a distributed connection admission control.

6.1 Service-level Specification

   Service level (i.e. service-level specification) parameter could be
   implemented as a 16-bit integer which refer to parameters detailed
   in the previous sub-section (service-related parameters). This
   parameter indicates the class-of-service offered by the optical
   network carrier.

   The first 256 values (0 û 255) are reserved for future inter-
   operability agreements between carriers and service providers. The
   remaining values are carrier specific.

   The service-level parameter could include the following attributes:
      - Optical Signal Quality
      - Protection parameters
      - Priority and Preemption
      - Routing parameters
      - Signaling security levels

   For instance, value 0x1x might indicate through a request to a
   directory service, a best-effort service:
      - unprotected LSP
      - default priority
      - no routing diversity
      - no signalling authentication

   Value ranging from 0x2x to 0x7x to might indicate through a request
   to a directory service, a bronze service:
      - M:N protected LSP
      - low-priority
      - no routing diversity
      - signalling authentication (no signalling encryption)

   Value ranging from 0x8x to 0xDx to might indicate through a request
   to a directory service, a silver service:
      - M:N protected LSP
      - medium-priority
      - no routing diversity
      - signalling authentication (no signalling encryption)



Papadimitriou et al.     Expires January 2002                       24


draft-papadimitriou-enhanced-lsps-04.txt                     July 2001

   Value 0xEx might indicate through a request to a directory service,
   a gold service:
      - 1:1 protected LSP
      - high-priority
      - global routing diversity
      - signalling authentication and encryption

   The optical signal quality levels need to be defined while a low
   signal quality does not have to necessarily correspond to a Best-
   Effort service.

   Consequently, this means that the client knows the meaning of the
   service-level prior to the corresponding LSP service request. Within
   the LSP request, explicit parameter values take precedence over
   service-level.

   The definition of the corresponding mechanisms lead us to two
   options that seems feasible for this purpose:
      - either the client LSR knows the content of the policy-related
        parameters without any additional information coming from the
        optical network
      - or the client LSR initiates an LSP service request (or
        even a dedicated request) with appropriate extensions to
        request the policy-related parameters values to the optical
        network. So the client learns dynamically the service-level
        offered by the optical network through a directory service
        before initiate a LSP create request to the ingress OLSR. In
        future release of this memo, we will refer to this as Service
        Discovery Service (SDS) at the domain service interface.


6.2 Scheduling Service

   Scheduling refers to the possibility to create, delete or modify LSP
   through a given time-of-day, day-to-day, day-to-week, etc.
   scheduling plan.

   For a given plan, the scheduling functions could be start, stop and
   repeat. The attributes of these scheduling functions could be:
      - the start/stop time at which the function has to be
        executed/stopped
      - the start/stop date at which the function has to be
        executed/stopped
      - the recurrence interval between two repeated execution of the
        function
      - the number of recurrence intervals

   The default values of the schedule parameter regarding the LSP
   requested service:
      - the start time is the current time (start now)
      - the start date is the current date (start now)
      - the recurrence interval is infinite since the LSP request has

draft-papadimitriou-enhanced-lsps-04.txt                     July 2001

        to be executed only once
      - the number of recurrence intervals equals zero

6.3 Billing Service

   The billing parameter refers to the billing client identifier onto
   which the requested services will be charged. A given client ID
   could have more than one billing client identifier.

   An optical network client (identified by a Client ID) could have
   several clients (i.e. VPN IDs) and assign to each of them a
   dedicated billing identifier.

   This parameter is implemented as a 16-bit integer. The first 256
   values (from 0 to 255) are reserved for future inter-operability
   agreements. The remaining values are carrier specific so left with
   unspecified semantic.

7. Security Considerations

   By including within the service-level parameter the signalling
   security level, the proposed document, as detailed in section 6,
   takes into account the security of the client signalling request
   in a build-in manner.
