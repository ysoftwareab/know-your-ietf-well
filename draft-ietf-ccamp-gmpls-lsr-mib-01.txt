1. Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects for modeling a
   Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) [GMPLSArch] Label
   Switching Router (LSR).

   Comments should be made directly to the CCAMP mailing list at
   ccamp@ops.ietf.org.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119, reference
   [RFC2119].

1.1. Migration Strategy

   This MIB module extends the Label Switching Router MIB module defined
   for use with MPLS [LSRMIB].  The only changes made are additions for
   support of GMPLS or changes that are necessary to support the
   increased complexity of a GMPLS system.

   The companion document modeling and managing GMPLS based traffic
   engineering [GMPLSTEMIB] extends the MPLS TE MIB module [TEMIB] with
   the same intentions.

   Textual conventions and OBJECT-IDENTIFIERS are defined in
   [GMPLSTCMIB] which extends the set of textual conventions originally
   defined in [TCMIB].

2. Terminology

   This document uses terminology from the document describing the MPLS
   architecture [RFC3031] and the GMPLS architecture [GMPLSArch].

   A label switched path (LSP) is modeled as a connection consisting of
   one or more incoming segments (in-segments) and/or one or more
   outgoing segments (out-segments) at an LSR. The association or
   interconnection of the in-segments and out-segments is accomplished
   by using a cross-connect. We use the terminology "connection" and
   "LSP" interchangeably where the meaning is clear from the context.

      in-segment     This is analogous to a GMPLS label on an interface.
      out-segment    This is analogous to a GMPLS label on an interface.
      cross-connect  This describes the conceptual connection between a
                     set of in-segments and out-segments.
                     Note that either set may be 0; that is, a cross-
                     connect may connect only out-segments together with
                     no in-segments in the case where an LSP is
                     originating on an LSR.


3. The SNMP Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a
   MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD
   58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC
   2580 [RFC2580].


4. Outline

   Configuring statically provisioned GMPLS LSPs through an LSR involves
   the following steps:

   -  Configuring an interface using the MPLS LSR MIB module.

   -  Enabling GMPLS on GMPLS capable interfaces using this MIB module.

   -  Configuring in-segments and out-segments using the MPLS LSR MIB
      module.

   -  Configuring GMPLS extensions to the in-segments and out-segments
      using this MIB module.

   -  Setting up the cross-connect table in the MPLS LSR MIB module to
      associate segments and/or to indicate connection origination and
      termination.

Internet Draft    draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-lsr-mib-01.txt      August 2003

   -  Optionally setting up labels in the label table in this MIB module
      if the textual convention
      MplsLabel is not capable of holding the required label (for
      example, if the label requires more than 32 bits to encode it), or
      if the operator wishes to disambiguate GMPLS label types.

   -  Optionally specifying label stack actions in the MPLS LSR MIB
      module.

   -  Optionally specifying segment traffic parameters in the MPLS LSR
      MIB module.

4.1. Summary of the GMPLS LSR MIB Module

   The MIB tables in this MIB module are as follows.

   -  The interface configuration table (gmplsInterfaceTable), which
      extends mplsInterfaceTable to enable the GMPLS protocol on MPLS-
      capable interfaces.

   -  The in-segment (gmplsInSegmentTable) and out-segment
      (gmplsOutSegmentTable) tables extend mplsInSegmentTable and
      mplsOutSegmentTable to configuring GMPLS-specific parameters for
      LSP segments at an LSR.

   -  The gmplsLabelTable extends mplsLabelTable and allows Generalized
      Labels to be defined and managed in a central location.
      Generalized Labels can be of variable length and have distinct
      bit-by-bit interpretations according to the use that is made of
      them.

   These tables are described in the subsequent sections.


5. Bidirectional LSPs

   This MIB supports bidirectional LSPs as required for GMPLS.
   A single value of mplsXCIndex is shared by all of the segments for
   the entire bidirectional LSP. This facilitates a simple reference
   from [TEMIB] and [GMPLSTEMIB], and makes fate-sharing more obvious.

   It is, however, important that the direction of segments is
   understood to avoid connecting all in-segments to all out-segments.
   This is achieved by an object in each segment that indicates the
   direction of the segment with respect to data flow.

   A segment that is marked as 'forward' carries data from the 'head' of
   the LSP to the 'tail'. A segment marked as 'reverse' carries data in
   the reverse direction.

   Where an LSP is signaled using a conventional signaling protocol, the
   'head' of the LSP is the source of the signaling (also known as the
   ingress) and the 'tail' is the destination (also known as the
   egress). For manually configured LSPs an arbitrary decision must be
   made about which segments are 'forward' and which 'reverse'. For



Nadeau, Srinivasan, Farrel, Hall and Harrison                   [Page 4]

Internet Draft    draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-lsr-mib-01.txt      August 2003

   consistency this decision should be made across all LSRs that
   participate in the LSP by assigning 'head' and 'tail' ends to the
   LSP.


6. Example of LSP Setup

   In this section we provide a brief example of using the MIB objects
   described in section 9 to set up an LSP. While this example is not
   meant to illustrate every nuance of the MIB, it is intended as an aid
   to understanding some of the key concepts. It is meant to be read
   after going through the MIB itself. A prerequisite is an
   understanding of [LSRMIB].

   Suppose that one would like to manually create a best-effort, bi-
   directional LSP. Assume that, in the forward direction, the LSP
   enters the LSR via MPLS interface A with ifIndex 12 and exits the LSR
   via MPLS interface B with ifIndex 13. For the reverse direction, we
   assume the LSP enters via interface B and leaves via interface A
   (i.e. the forward and reverse directions use the same bi-directional
   interfaces). Let us also assume that we do not wish to have a label
   stack beneath the top label on the outgoing labeled packets. The
   following example illustrates which rows and corresponding objects
   might be created to accomplish this.

   First, the traffic parameter entries must be set-up for both
   segments. These are configured entirely in the MPLS LSR MIB through
   the mplsTrafficParamTable.

   Note that for a bi-directional LSP, the segments in the reverse
   direction MAY share the traffic parameter entries (and hence
   resources) with the segments in the forward direction.

   We must next create the appropriate in-segment and out-segment
   entries with suitable traffic parameters by pointing to the
   appropriate traffic parameter entries that we have just created. This
   is also done in the MPLS LSR MIB using mplsInSegmentTable and
   mplsOutSegmentTable.

   These table entries are extended by entries in gmplsInSegmentTable
   and gmplsOutSegmentTable. Note that the nature of the 'extends'
   relationship is that the entry in gmplsInSegmentTable has the same
   index values as the entry in mplsInSegmentTable. Similarly, the entry
   in gmplsOutSegmentTable has the same index values as the entry in
   mplsOutSegmentTable.

   First for the forward direction:

   In gmplsInSegmentTable
   {
     gmplsInSegmentDirection          = forward (1),
   }

   In gmplsOutSegmentTable
   {
     gmplsOutSegmentDirection         = forward (1)
   }

Internet Draft    draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-lsr-mib-01.txt      August 2003

   Next for the reverse direction:

   In gmplsInSegmentTable
   {
     gmplsInSegmentDirection          = reverse (2)
   }

   In gmplsOutSegmentTable
   {
     gmplsOutSegmentDirection         = reverse (2)
   }

   Next, two cross-connect entries are created in the mplsXCTable of the
   MPLS LSR MIB, thereby associating the newly created segments
   together.

           of labels in use in the system. When label
           representation is desired to apply to the whole

           labels by their interfaces, this index MAY be set

        -  The label index provides a way of identifying the

        -  The label sub-index is only used for concatenated
           labels. It identifies each component label. When
           non-concatenated labels are used, this index
           SHOULD be set to zero.

        A storage type object is supplied to control the
        storage type for each entry, but implementations
        should note that the storage type of conceptual rows
        in other tables that include row pointers to an

9. Security Considerations

   It is clear that the MIB modules described in this document in
   association with the MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB are potentially useful for
   monitoring of GMPLS LSRs. These MIB modules can also be used for
   configuration of certain objects, and anything that can be configured
   can be incorrectly configured, with potentially disastrous results.

   There are a number of management objects defined in these MIB modules
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. Such

Nadeau, Srinivasan, Farrel, Hall and Harrison                  [Page 25]

Internet Draft    draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-lsr-mib-01.txt      August 2003

   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments. The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations. These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  the gmplsInterfaceTable, gmplsInSegmentTable, gmplsOutSegmentTable
      and gmplsLabelTable collectively contain objects to provision
      GMPLS interfaces, LSPs and their associated parameters on a Label
      Switching Router (LSR). Unauthorized write access to objects in
      these tables, could result in disruption of traffic on the
      network. This is especially true if an LSP has already been
      established. The use of stronger mechanisms such as SNMPv3
      security should be considered where possible. Specifically, SNMPv3
      VACM and USM MUST be used with any SNMPv3 agent which implements
      these MIB modules.

   Some of the readable objects in these MIB modules "i.e., objects with
   a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible" may be considered sensitive
   or vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP. These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  the gmplsInterfaceTable, gmplsInSegmentTable, gmplsOutSegmentTable
      and gmplsLabelTable collectively show the LSP network topology and
      its capabilities. If an Administrator does not want to reveal this
      information, then these tables should be considered
      sensitive/vulnerable.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even
   if the network itself is secure "for example by using IPSec", even
   then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed
   to access and GET/SET "read/change/create/delete" the objects in
   these MIB modules. It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the
   security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework "see [RFC3410],
   section 8", including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic
   mechanisms "for authentication and privacy".

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals "users" that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET "change/create/delete" them.

11. IANA Considerations

   MPLS related standards track MIB modules are rooted under the
   mplsStdMIB subtree.

   One of the MIB modules contained in this document extends tables
   contained in MPLS MIB modules.

   As requested in requested in the GMPLS-TC-STD-MIB [GMPLSTCMIB] the
   two MIB modules contained in this document should be placed in the
   mplsStdMIB subtree as well.

   New assignments can only be made via a Standards Action as specified
   in [RFC2434].

11.1. IANA Considerations for GMPLS-LSR-STD-MIB

   The IANA is requested to assign { mplsStdMIB xx } to the
   GMPLS-LSR-STD-MIB module specified in this document.

11.2. IANA Considerations for GMPLS-LABEL-STD-MIB

   The IANA is requested to assign { mplsStdMIB xx } to the
   GMPLS-LABEL-STD-MIB module specified in this document.

16. Changes and Pending Work

   This section must be removed before the draft progresses to RFC.

16.1. Pending Work

   The following work items have been identified for this draft. They
   will be addressed in a future version.

   - Expand conformance statements to give one for monitoring only,
     and one for monitoring and control.

   - Extend mplsTrafficParamsTable from the MPLS-LSR-MIB to support
     GMPLS traffic parameters for signaled and static LSPs.

   - Provide support for monitoring tunnel resources in GMPLS systems.
     For example, SONET/SDH or G.709.  This might be done through an
     arbitrary RowPointer to an external MIB.

   - Extend the performance tables from the MPLS-LSR-MIB for
     technology-specific GMPLS LSPs.

   - Supply more and better examples, especially ones using the Label
     Table.

   - Provide a next index object to supply the next available
     arbitrary index into the Label Table.
