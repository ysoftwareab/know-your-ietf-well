1.  Introduction

   YANG [RFC6020] is a data definition language that was introduced to
   define the contents of a conceptual data store that allows networked
   devices to be managed using NETCONF [RFC6241].  YANG is proving
   relevant beyond its initial confines, as bindings to other interfaces
   (e.g RESTCONF [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf]) and encodings other than
   XML (e.g JSON) are being defined.  Furthermore, YANG data models can
   be used as the basis of implementation for other interfaces, such as
   CLI and programmatic APIs.

   This document defines a YANG data model that can be used to configure
   and manage Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)[RFC5880].  BFD is
   a network protocol which is used for liveness detection of arbitrary
   paths between systems.  Some examples of different types of paths
   over which we have BFD:

   1) Two systems directly connected via IP.  This is known as BFD over
   single-hop IP [RFC5881]

   2) Two systems connected via multiple hops [RFC5883]

   3) Two systems connected via MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs)
   [RFC5884]

   4) Two systems connected via a Link Aggregation Group (LAG) interface
   [RFC7130]

   BFD typically does not operate on its own.  Various control
   protocols, also known as BFD clients, use the services provided by
   BFD for their own operation [RFC5882].  The obvious candidates which
   use BFD are those which do not have Hellos to detect failures, e.g.
   static routes, and routing protocols whose Hellos do not suport sub-
   second failure detection, e.g.  OSPF and IS-IS.

2.  Design of the Data Model

   The BFD YANG data model follows a VRF-centric model by augmenting the
   "routing-protocol" data node in [I-D.ietf-netmod-routing-cfg].

Internet-Draft                  BFD Yang                       July 2015


2.1.  Design of Configuration Model

   The configuration model consists mainly of the parameters specified
   in [RFC5880].  Some examples are desired minimum transmit interval,
   required minimum receive interval, detection multiplier, etc

   Some implementations have BFD session configuration under the BFD
   clients.  For example, BFD session configuration is under routing
   applications such as OSPF, IS-IS, BGP etc.  Other implementations
   have BFD session configuration centralized under BFD, i.e. outside
   the multiple BFD clients.

   The BFD parameters of interest to a BFD client are mainly the
   multiplier and interval(s) since those parameters impact the
   convergence time of the BFD clients when a failure occurs.  So the
   configuration model has groupings, containing multiplier and
   interval(s), which are to be used by BFD clients.  Other parameters
   which remain under BFD control, e.g. demand mode and authentication,
   are configured under BFD.

   We provide groupings, which contain the basic BFD session parameters,
   for applications to use.  This ensures consistency of BFD parameters
   across applications.

   Although [RFC5880] allows for different values for transmit and
   receive intervals, many implementations allow users to specify just
   one interval which is used for both transmit and receive intervals or
   separate values for transmit and receive intervals.  Our YANG model
   supports this: there is a choice between "min-interval", used for
   both transmit and receive intervals, and "desired-min-tx-interval"
   and "required-min-rx-interval".


2.1.1.  Single-hop IP

   For single-hop IP, the BFD multiplier and interval(s) are configured
   in BFD clients.  It is highly desirable to have the BFD configuration
   consistent between those clients.  Therefore, we have a grouping for
   BFD configuration that applications can import in their YANG module:

   - This provides consistency since the same grouping is being used in
   all applications making use of BFD.

   - Not all implementations of those BFD clients have support for BFD,
   we must use if-feature in the respective YANG modules.

   An application importing the BFD configuration grouping could do so
   in a hierarchical manner if it has multiple levels at which BFD

Internet-Draft                  BFD Yang                       July 2015


   configuration can be applied.  In a subsequent section, we provide an
   example of how a BFD client would use the grouping in such a way.

   The configuration items are:

   enabled
           Set to true to enable BFD.

   local-multiplier
           This is the detection time multiplier as defined in
           [RFC5880].

   min-interval
           This is the Desired Min TX Interval and Required Min RX
           Interval as defined in [RFC5880].

           OR

   desired-min-tx-interval
           This is the Desired Min TX Interval as defined in [RFC5880].

   required-min-rx-interval
           This is the Required Min RX Interval as defined in [RFC5880].

2.1.2.  Multi-hop IP

   We have a list for BFD sessions over multi-hop IP.  The key consists
   of:

   source address
           Address belonging to the local system as per [RFC5883]

   destination address
           Address belonging to the remote system as per [RFC5883]

   Since we are following a VRF-centric model we do not need a VRF field
   in the key.

   Here is the list of parameters:

   local-multiplier
           This is the detection time multiplier as defined in
           [RFC5880].

   desired-min-tx-interval
           This is the Desired Min TX Interval as defined in [RFC5880].

   required-min-rx-interval

Internet-Draft                  BFD Yang                       July 2015


           This is the Required Min RX Interval as defined in [RFC5880].

   demand-enabled
           Set to true to enable demand mode as defined in [RFC5880].

   enable-authentication
           Set to true to enable BFD authentication.

   authentication-algorithm
           Authentication algorithm to use, if enabled.

   key-chain-name
           Key-chain to be used for authentication, if enabled.

   tx-ttl
           TTL of outgoing BFD control packets.

   rx-ttl
           Minimum TTL of incoming BFD control packets.

2.1.3.  Traffic Engineering Tunnels

   For Traffic Engineering (TE) tunnels, BFD is configured under the TE
   tunnel since it is the Traffic Enginnering application which knows
   the desired failure detection parameters.  The grouping for BFD
   clients in Section 2.1.1 can be used by the TE application for the
   basic BFD parameters.  For BFD parameters which are specific to the
   TE application, e.g. whether to tear down the tunnel in the event of
   a BFD session failure, these parameters will be defined in the YANG
   model of the TE application.

2.1.4.  LDP Label Switched Paths

   For LDP LSPs, BFD is configured under the LDP FEC.  The grouping for
   BFD clients in Section 2.1.1 can be used by the LDP application for
   the basic BFD parameters.  For BFD parameters which are specific to
   the LDP application, if any, these parameters will be defined in the
   YANG model of the LDP application.

2.1.5.  Link Aggregation Groups

   Per [RFC7130], configuring BFD on LAG consists of having micro-BFD
   sessions on each LAG member link.  The grouping for BFD clients in
   Section 2.1.1 can be used by the LAG application for the basic BFD
   parameters.  This grouping can be used per-LAG or per member-link.
   For BFD parameters which are specific to the LAG application, e.g.
   the IP address of the peer system which can be reached by the LAG,

   the parameters will be defined in the YANG model of the LAG
   application.

2.1.6.  Per-interface Configuration

   With multiplier and intervals configured under the BFD clients, we
   still need a central location to configure authentication, demand
   mode, etc.  This can be done by configuring the following parameters
   per interface:

   demand-enabled
           Set to true to enable demand mode as defined in [RFC5880].

   enable-authentication
           Set to true to enable BFD authentication.

   authentication-algorithm
           Authentication algorithm to use, if enabled.

   key-chain-name
           Key-chain to be used for authentication, if enabled.

   desired-min-echo-tx-interval
           This is the minimum interval that the local system would like
           to use when transmitting BFD echo packets.  If 0, the echo
           function as defined in [RFC5880] is disabled.

   required-min-echo-rx-interval
           This is the Required Min Echo RX Interval as defined in
           [RFC5880].

2.2.  Design of Operational Model

   The operational model contains both the overall statistics of BFD
   sessions running on the device and the per session operational
   statistics.  Since BFD is used for liveness detection of arbitrary
   paths, there is no uniform key to identify a BFD session.  E.g. a BFD
   single-hop IP session is uniquely identified by the combination of
   destination IP address and interface whereas a multihop IP session is
   uniquely identified by the combination of source IP address and
   destination IP address (in the context of a VRF).  For this reason,
   for per-session operational statistics, we do not have a single list
   with different type BFD sessions.  Instead, we have a container where
   we have multiple lists, where each list corresponds to one specific
   path type for BFD.  For example, we have one operational list for BFD
   single-hop IP, another list for BFD multi-hop IP, etc.  In each list,
   mainly three categories of operational items are shown.  The
   fundamental information of a BFD session such as the local



Zheng, et al.            Expires January 6, 2016                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                  BFD Yang                       July 2015


   discriminator, remote discriminator and the capability of supporting
   demand detect mode are shown in the first category.  The second
   category includes a BFD session running information, e.g. the FSM the
   device in and diagnostic code received.  Another example is the
   actual transmit interval between the control packets, which may be
   different from the desired minimum transmit interval configured, is
   shown in this category.  Similar examples are actual received
   interval between the control packets and the actual transmit interval
   between the echo packets.  The third category contains the detailed
   statistics of the session, e.g. when the session transitioned up/down
   and how long it has been in that state.

   For some session types, there may be more than 1 session on the
   virtual path to the destination.  For example, with IP multi-hop
   there could be multiple BFD sessions from the source to the same
   destination to test the various paths (ECMP) to the destination.
   Each of the BFD sessions on the same virtual path is uniquely
   identified by the source UDP port


2.3.  Notifications

   This YANG model defines a list of notifications to inform clients of
   BFD of important events detected during the protocol operation.  Pair
   of local and remote discriminator identifies a BFD session on local
   system.  Notifications also give more important details about BFD
   sessions; e.g. new state, time in previous state, routing-instance
   and the reason that the BFD session state changed.


2.4.  RPC Operations

   TBD

2.5.  BFD Configuration Data Hierarchy

2.5.1.  Centralized BFD Configuration

   The following is the centralized configuration data hierarchy:

   We have a container which contains a list for each session type.
   This contains session configuration for only IP multi-hop sessions.

   We have per-interface configuration for authentication, demand-mode,
   etc.  This is used e.g. for IP single-hop sessions whose base BFD
   configuration belongs to the BFD clients.

   We have a list of areas and in each area we have a list of
   interfaces.  The BFD configuration grouping is used in a hierarchical
   fashion, it can be applied in "area" and "interface":

   - If BFD configuration is applied under an interface, that
   configuration takes precedence over any BFD configuration, if any, at
   the area level

   - If BFD configuration is applied under an "area" and none of the
   interfaces in that area has BFD configuration, then all interfaces
   belong to the "area" in question inherit the BFD configuration for
   the area in question.

   - If the BFD client implementation supports "interface all", then all
   the interfaces belonging to that area will inherit the BFD
   configuration under "interface all".  Additionally, if there is
   specific interface configuration, then the specific interface will
   override the "interface all" parameters.

   - The tx and rx intervals can be configured separately or a single
   interval can be configured.

2.12.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this memo is designed to be accessed via
   the NETCONF protocol [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the
   secure transport layer and the mandatory to implement secure
   transport is SSH [RFC6242].  The NETCONF access control model
   [RFC6536] provides the means to restrict access for particular
   NETCONF users to a pre-configured subset of all available NETCONF
   protocol operations and content.

   The YANG module has writeable data nodes which can be used for
   creation of BFD sessions and modification of BFD session parameters.
   The system should "police" creation of BFD sessions to prevent new
   sessions from causing existing BFD sessions to fail.  For BFD session
   modification, the BFD protocol has mechanisms in place which allow
   for in service modification.

2.13.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to as assign a new new namespace URI from the
   IETF XML registry.

   URI:TBD
