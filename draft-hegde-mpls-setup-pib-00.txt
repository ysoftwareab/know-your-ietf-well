Abstract 
    
   This document specifies a set of provisioning classes (PRC) for 
   configuring a MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) router. Instances 
   of these classes reside in a virtual information store called MPLS 
   Setup Policy Information Base (PIB). COPS protocol [COPS] with the 
   extensions for provisioning [COPS-PR] is used to transmit this MPLS 
   Setup policy information to MPLS Routers. The PRCs defined in this 
   MPLS Setup PIB are intended for use by the COPS-PR MPLS client type. 
   They complement the PRCs defined in the Framework PIB [FR-PIB].

1. Introduction 
    
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) [MPLS-ARCH] defines an 
   architecture where data packets are forwarded based on a short label 
   instead of the entire packet header. This allows faster processing 
   of packets as well as network traffic engineering. The sequence of 
   routers or hops taken by a packet with MPLS label is called Label 
   Switched Path (LSP) and a router that forwards the packets based on 
   MPLS label is a Label Switching Router (LSR).  
    
   In order to distribute labels and configure LSPs, a label 
   distribution protocol is used. MPLS allows for multiple signaling 
   protocols. Two protocols that seem to be prominent are RSVP-TE 
   (RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels) [RSVP-TE] and CR-LDP 
   (Constraint-Based LSP Setup using LDP). 
    
   Configuring and managing the LSPs can be a difficult task especially 
   when there are a large number of LSPs and when multiple routers are 
   to be configured. Policy Based Management (PBM), as specified in 
   [RAP-FRAMEWORK], is a good solution to configure and manage MPLS 
   routers.  
    
   In PBM, using the configuration model, a Policy Decision Point (PDP) 
   downloads policies to Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs) whenever 
   required. Policy provisioning is done by means of the COPS protocol 
   [COPS] with the extensions for provisioning [COPS-PR]. The MPLS 
   routers act as PEPs and a PDP can provision the required policies to 
   these devices. The policies consist of information required to 
   configure MPLS LSPs on an MPLS router.

   This document specifies the format of policy information required 
   for MPLS LSP Setup in the form of PIB. The PIB contained in this 
   draft is written using SPPI (Structure of Policy Provisioning 
   Information) [SPPI]. This PIB specifies PRovisioning Classes (PRCs) 
   for configuring an MPLS router.  
    
   The PRCs defined in this MPLS Setup PIB are intended for use by the 
   COPS-PR MPLS Setup client type.  Furthermore, these PRCs are in 
   addition to the PRCs defined in the Framework PIB [FR-PIB].

2. Operation Overview 
    
   A brief description of interaction between PEP (MPLS router) and PDP 
   (policy server) is given in the next paragraph. For a more detailed 
   description of protocol exchange between PDP and provisioning PEPs, 
   please see [COPS-PR]. 
    
   Once TCP connection is established between the PEP and the PDP, the 
   PEP sends a Client-Open message to the PDP, specifying MPLS Setup 
   client type. The PDP responds with a Client-Accept (CAT) message. 
   The PDP may send a Client-Close message, if it does not recognize 
   the MPLS Setup client type. After receiving CAT message, the PEP 
   sends a request (REQ) message to the PDP. The REQ message contains 
   æconfiguration requestÆ context object and relevant PIB class 
   instances that include the PEPÆs (MPLS Router's) capabilities, 
   supported PIB classes etc. The PDP then sends a Decision (DEC) 
   message that includes all the PIB classes that are used to configure 
   the MPLS LSPs on the PEP. The PEP uses the information in the DEC 
   message and configures LSPs accordingly. The PEP then sends a 
   Report-State (RPT) message to the PDP indicating success or failure 
   to install the policies. The PEP may also send periodic RPT messages 
   to inform about status of installed policies or to convey 
   accounting/monitoring type information to the PDP. The PEP may issue 
   updated REQ message if there is any change in its status and the PDP 
   may send updated DEC message with update PIB whenever necessary. The 
   PEP can delete a request by sending Delete-Request (DRQ) message to 
   the PDP. The PDP may also ask the PEP to delete an existing request 
   state by sending a command via DEC message. Finally, Client-Close 
   (CC) message is used to cancel the corresponding Client-Open 
   message.  
    
    
3. Structure of MPLS Setup PIB 
    
   The MPLS PIB consists of six main groups of PRCs. The first group 
   contains PRCs for MPLS Forward Equivalence Class (FEC). The second 
   group contains PRCs for MPLS label request objects. The third group 
   contains PRCs for MPLS Traffic (Flow) specifications. The fourth 
   group contains PRCs for MPLS LSP Explicit Route Objects (ERO). The 
   fifth group contains a PRC for MPLS LSP Preemption parameters. The 
   sixth and final group contains a PRC for MPLS LSPs that essentially 
   tie instances of the first five groups together. 
    
   The following simple figure shows the relationship between the 
   various PRC groups.

            Fig. 2. Relationships of MPLS Setup PRCs (Classes)  
    
    
3.1. Forward Equivalence Class (FEC) Classes 
    
   This group contains PRCs for MPLS FEC. Each PRC defines a type of 
   FEC. The various types of FECs are IPv4 host address, IPv6 host 
   address, IPv4 prefix, IPv6 prefix and Autonomous System number.  
    
3.2. Label Request Classes 
    
   This group contains PRCs for MPLS Label Request objects. The three 
   PRCs in this group define Generic Label Request object, ATM Label 
   Request object and Frame Relay Label Request object. 
    
3.3. Flow (Traffic) Specification Classes 
    
   This group contains PRCs for Traffic Parameters for LSPs. The three 
   PRCs in this group define MPLS traffic specification, Integrated 
   Services Controlled Load Service flow specification and Integrated 
   Services Guaranteed Service flow specification. The first one is 
   used in CR-LDP and the rest are used in RSVP-TE.  
    
3.4. Explicit Route Object (ERO) Classes 
    
   This group contains PRCs for ERO. There are three PRCs that define 
   the three types of Sub Objects; namely, IPv4 Prefix, IPv6 Prefix and 
   Autonomous System Number. The fourth PRC is used to make a list with 
   any of the above three sub objects and the fifth PRC is used to 
   group the subjects together to form an ERO list for an LSP. 
    
3.5. Preemption Classes 
    
   This group contains a PRC for defining LSP Preemption parameters.

3.6. LSP Setup Classes 
    
   This group contains a PRC for tying instances of above PRCs to form 
   an LSP. This PRC contains pointers to instances of other PRCs to 
   collect all the parameters required for setting up an LSP.

5. Security Considerations 
    
   The information contained in a PIB when transported by the COPS 
   protocol [COPS-PR] may be sensitive, and its function of provisioning 
   a PEP requires that only authorized communication take place. COPS 
   provides an Integrity mechanism for its messages that achieves 
   authentication and integrity of all messages exchanged between PEP 
   and PDP. The use of IPSEC between PDP and PEP, as described in 
   [COPS], which is optional, provides additional protection in the form 
   of confidentiality. For a more detailed description of security 
   considerations relevant to PIBs, please see [FR-PIB].
