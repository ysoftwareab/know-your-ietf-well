   Internet Draft             IPPM reporting MIB              November 2002 




   1. Introduction 
	  This memo defines a MIB for managing measures based upon the IP 
	  performance metrics specified by the IPPM Working Group. 

	  The definition of objects in the IPPM MIB are built on notions 
	  introduced and discussed in the IPPM Framework document, RFC 2330 
	  [ii]. 

	  This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB), and as such it 
	  is intended to be respectful of the "Boilerplate for IETF MIBs" 
	  defined in http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-boilerplate.html. 

	  There are companion documents to the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB both in the 
	  Transport Area (See section 2), and in the Operations and Management 
	  Area (See section 3). The reader should be familiar with these 
	  documents.  

   2. The IPPM Framework 

	  The IPPM Framework consists of 3 major components: 

	  A general framework for defining performance metrics, as described in 
	  the Framework for IP Performance Metrics, RFC 2330 [2]; 

	  A set of standardized metrics which conform to this framework: The 
	  IPPM Metrics for Measuring Connectivity, RFC 2678 [iii]; The One-way 
	  Delay Metric for IPPM, RFC 2679 [iv]; The One-way Packet Loss Metric 
	  for IPPM, RFC 2680 [v]; The Round-trip Delay Metric for IPPM, RFC 
	  2681 [vi]. 

	  Emerging metrics that are being specified in respect of this 
	  framework. 

   3. The IPPM Framework 

	  The IPPM Framework consists in 3 major components: 

		   A general framework for defining performance metrics, described  
	  in the Framework for IP Performance Metrics, RFC 2330 [2]; 

		   A set of standardized metrics which conform to this framework: 
	  The IPPM Metrics for Measuring Connectivity, RFC 2678 [3]; The One-
	  way Delay Metric for IPPM, RFC 2679 [4]; The One-way Packet Loss 
	  Metric for IPPM, RFC 2680 [5]; The Round-trip Delay Metric for IPPM, 
	  RFC 2681 [6]. 

	  Emerging metrics that are being specified in respect of this 
	  framework.

   4. The SNMP Management Framework 

	  The SNMP Management Framework consists of five major components: 

		   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [7]. 

		   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the 
	  purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of 
	  Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, 
	  RFC 1155 [8], STD 16, RFC 1212 [9] and RFC 1215 [10].  The second 
	  version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [11], STD 58, 
	  RFC 2579 [12] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [13]. 

		   Message protocols for transferring management information. The 
	  first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and 
	  described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [14]. A second version of the SNMP 
	  message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, 
	  is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [15] and RFC 1906 [16].  
	  The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and 
	  described in RFC 1906 [16], RFC 2572 [17] and RFC 2574 [18]. 

		   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The 
	  first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is 
	  described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [14].  A second set of protocol 
	  operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [19]. 

		   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [20] and 
	  the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 [21]. 

	  A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework 
	  can be found in RFC 2570 [22]. 

	  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
	  the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are 
	  defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI. 

	  This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A 
	  MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate 
	  translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically 
	  equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no 
	  translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable 
	  information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in 
	  SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine 
	  readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the 
	  MIB. 

	  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
	  the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are 
	  defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)

	  defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an 
	  OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.   

	  The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely 
	  identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human 
	  convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to 
	  refer to the object type.

   5. Overview 

	  Although the number of measurement devices that implement IPPM 
	  metrics is growing, there is not currently any standardized 
	  management interface to manage remotely the measurement of these 
	  metrics. This memo defines a Management Information Base for managing 
	  the measurement of IPPM metrics.  

	  To permit metrics to be referenced by other MIBs and other protocols, 
	  the IPPM WG has defined a registry of the current metrics and a 
	  framework for the integration of future metrics in the [IPPM metrics 
	  registry]. 

	  As the specification of new metrics is a continuous process, this 
	  memo defines a framework for the integration of the future 
	  standardized metrics. To address future needs specialized tables may 
	  be created, while augmenting the definition of the ippmMeasureTable. 

	  The MIB architecture is inspired by the RMON model [xxiii],[xxiv] 
	  which specifies the MIB for the monitoring of a single point of 
	  measure. The IPPM-REPORTING-MIB differs from this model in that IPPM 
	  metrics measurement involves several points of measure and requires 
	  common references for time and for measure identification. The IPPM-
	  REPORTING-MIB defines an absolute timeFilter. 

	  The IPPM-REPORTING-MIB introduces a framework where each application 
	  identifies its measures in an owner namespace. Using the namespace 
	  framework, an application may grant other owners access to its 
	  measurement results for aggregated metrics computation, reporting, or 
	  alarming. 

	  Different architectures may be used to perform metric measurements, 
	  using a control protocol and a test protocol. Different control 
	  frameworks are suitable for performing measurements. The memo lists 
	  them, while also looking for a way to integrate them with the IPPM-
	  REPORTING-MIB. This section is for informational purposes only, and 
	  is intended to help to specify the relationship among the test 
	  protocol, the control protocol and IPPM-REPORTING-MIB. 

	  Special care has been taken to provide a reporting mode suitable for 
	  control protocols and test protocols. It addresses the need to 
	  provide access to results for the applications. Moreover, it may be 
	  used to reduce the number of control frameworks. 

	  This MIB is intended to handle multiple concurrent sessions by SNMP 
	  applications. However, the SNMP requests are not necessarily to be 
	  handled explicitly by the measurement devices, but can be sent to 
	  middleware performing an aggregation function. This allows for 
	  continuous collection of measurements and statistics computation.

   5.1. Textual Conventions 

		 Four types of data are introduced as a textual convention in this 
	  document: TypeP, GMTTimeStamp, IppmStandardMetrics and 
	  IppmReportDefinition. 

   5.1.1. Packet of type P 

	  Section 13 of the IPPM framework [2] introduces the generic notion of 
	  a "packet of type P" because in some contexts the metric's value 
	  depends on the type of the packets involved in the metric. In the 
	  definition of a metric, the type P will be explicitly defined, 
	  partially defined, or left generic. Measurement of metrics defined 
	  with generic type P are made specific when performing actual 
	  measurements. This naming convention serves as an important reminder 
	  that one must be conscious of the exact type of traffic being 
	  measured. 

	  The standardization of the management of the IPPM measures relies on 
	  the capability to finely and unambiguously configure the type P of 
	  the packets, and the parameters of the protocol suites of the type P. 

	  RMON2 introduced the concept of protocol identifiers.  RFC2895 [xxv] 
	  specifies a macro for the definition of protocol identifier. The 
	  RFC2896 [xxvi] defines the protocol identifiers for different 
	  protocol encapsulation trees. 

	  The type P implementation relies on the MACRO PROTOCOL-IDENTIFIER 
	  defined for identifying protocol suites in RMON2. It is achieved by 
	  defining the TypeP as a new syntax in SMIv2 TEXTUAL-CONVENTION. 

   5.1.1.1. Internet addresses 

	  The section 14 of the IPPM framework defines (for the usual case of a 
	  unidirectional path through the Internet) the term "Src" and "Dst". 
	  "Src" denotes the IP address of the beginning of the path, and "Dst" 
	  denotes the IP address of the end.  

	  The section 3 of the RMON PI Reference specifies the Protocol 
	  Identifier Encoding rules which consists briefly in a recursive 
	  length value format. "Src" and "Dst" are protocol identifier 
	  parameters. Their values are encoded in separated fields using the 
	  protocol identifier encoding rule, but without trailing parameters. 

	  The packet encapsulation defined in an instance of TypeP embeds the 
	  format of "Src" and "Dst" and their values. The type and value of 
	  these addresses depend on the type P of the packet, IP version 4, V6, 
	  IP in IP... Both participate in the completion of the packet 
	  encoding.

   Internet Draft             IPPM reporting MIB              November 2002 




	  Examples: 

	  RFC2896 defines the protocol identifiers ip and ipip4. Should there 
	  be an Internet tunnel end-point of the IP address 192.168.1.1 in the 
	  tunnel 128.2.6.7. the TypeP of the source address of the tunnel, Src, 
	  is 8.0.0.8.0.0.0.0.17.2.0.0 (ip.ipip4). The trailer 2.0.0 in the 
	  TypeP indicates that there are 2 parameters. In the IPPM context 
	  these 2 parameters are provided in Src, which has the value 
	  10.4.192.168.1.1.4.128.2.6.7. 

   5.1.2. GMTTimeStamp 

	  This textual convention defines the time at which an event occurred. 
	  It is very similar to the NTP timestamp format except that it 
	  represents the time elapsed since January 1st, 2000 instead of 
	  January 1st, 1900. 


   5.1.3. IppmStandardMetrics 

	  Each standard metric is identified in the IPPM-METRICS-REGISTRY under 
	  the node rfc in a chronological order. To permit several metrics to 
	  be performed in a single measure there is an need to describe in a 
	  bit string the metrics to be performed, granted... This textual 
	  convention defines an octet string that gathered in a bit string a 
	  sequence of bits. The bit order corresponds to the order of the 
	  metrics identifiers in the registry.  



   5.1.4. Report definition 

	  A report consists of sending, or logging, a subset of results of 
	  measurements that have been taken over a period of time. The report 
	  consists of actions that are taken on the measurement results. An 
	  action is performed either: 

	  + For each result 
	  + On the results corresponding to a measurement cycle 
	  + On the results available at the measurement completion.  

	  To preserve the scalability of the whole measurement system, it 
	  limits: 

	  + The amount of data sent to the applications 
	  + The bandwidth consumption for uploading the result 
	  + The number of alarms sent to the applications 
	  + The amount of data saved in the point of measure 


   Stephan/Jewitt     Informational - Expires April 2003           [Page 8] 


   Internet Draft             IPPM reporting MIB              November 2002 



	  The comparison of the measures results in a metric threshold that 
	  identifies particular measure values and times that directly impact 
	  service availability. 

	  The comparison of the duration of repeated events with a duration 
	  threshold identifies particular measure values and times that 
	  directly affect an SLA.  

	  The combination of IPPM metric results, threshold events, and event 
	  filtering provides a very efficient mechanism to report results, 
	  events, and alarms. 

	  A report is described using the TEXTUAL-CONVENTION 
	  IppmReportDefinition. The report setup must not dramatically increase 
	  the amount of data needed by the control protocol to setup a measure: 

	  +  A basic report is defined in the object ippmReportSetupDefinition; 
	  +  More elaborate reports are described using a metric threshold to 
	  generate alarms and events.  
	  +  Pushing of alarms and reports requires a management station 
	  address to which the data will be sent. 
	  +  SLA alarms are described using an events duration threshold. 

	  The TEXTUAL-CONVENTION IppmReportDefinition specifies the list of 
	  events and actions that are used to create a report. 


   5.2. Structure of the MIB 

	  The MIB is arranged as follow:                
	  - ippmOwnersGroup             

	  - ippmSystemGroup             

	  - ippmMeasureGroup    

	  - ippmHistoryGroup            

	  - ippmNetworkMeasureGroup             

	  - ippmAggregatedMeasureGroup  

	  - ippmReportGroup     

	  - ippmNotifications   



   5.2.1.  The ippmOwners Group  


   Stephan/Jewitt     Informational - Expires April 2003           [Page 9] 


   Internet Draft             IPPM reporting MIB              November 2002 


	  This group identifies an owner, or group of owners that have access 
	  to measurements on a probe. 

   5.2.2.  The ippmSystem Group 

	  This group consists of a set of parameters describing the clock 
	  synchronization at a particular point of measure over time. 

	  This group is critical to the implementation of the IPPM MIB.  

	  Section 6.3. of the IPPM Framework states that 
	  "Those who develop such measurement methodologies should strive to: 
		+    Minimize their uncertainties/errors, 
		+    Understand and document the sources of uncertainty/error, and 
		+    Quantify the amounts of uncertainty/error." 

	  The aim of this group is to have these values available to compute 
	  reliable statistics. The implementation of this group is mandatory, 
	  whether the time synchronization is automatic or not. 

   5.2.3. The ippmMeasureGroup 

	  This group displays all the measures configured on the measurement 
	  entity. It consists of the ippmMetricsTable and ippmMeasureTable. The 
	  ippmMeasureTable holds the common part of a measure, while the 
	  specific parameters are handled in the corresponding auxiliary table 
	  (ippmNetworkMeasure, ippmAggregatedMeasureTable...) . 


	  The measurement entity describes in the ippmMetricsTable of the SNMP 
	  agent the local implementation of the standardized metrics. All 
	  standardized metrics should be displayed in this table, with the 
	  capability object defining whether the metric is implemented or not. 

	  The control protocol registers a description of the existing measures 
	  in the ippmMeasureTable and in the auxiliary measure tables. The 
	  ippmMeasureTable table is read-create, but only allows for the 
	  creation of "aggregated" measures when defined in conjunction with 
	  the ippmAggregatedMeasureTable. Network measures are not allowed to 
	  be created directly by the management entity, and as such the measure 
	  table values for these measures should be display only. 


	  The results of the measurements are logged in the ippmHistoryTable. 



   5.2.4. The ippmNetworkMeasure Group  

	  The control protocol registers a description of the existing network 
	  measures in the ippmNetworkMeasureTable and in the ippmMeasureTable. 

   Stephan/Jewitt     Informational - Expires April 2003          [Page 10] 


   Internet Draft             IPPM reporting MIB              November 2002 



	  This group displays the network measures defined by the control 
	  protocol. The results are saved in the ippmHistoryTable.  

	  ippmNetworkMeasureTable is an auxiliary table of ippmMeasureTable, 
	  and is responsible for the configuration of the network measure. 

   5.2.5. The ippmAggregatedMeasure Group  

	  ippmAggregatedMeasureTable is an auxiliary table of ippmMeasureTable, 
	  and is responsible for the consolidation of the results previously 
	  measured and saved in the ippmHistoryTable. The aggregated results 
	  are saved in the ippmHistoryTable and may be used for higher 
	  aggregated measures.  

   5.2.6. The Report Group  

	  This group displays the existing reports of the measures collected. 
	  ippmReportSetupTable is an auxiliary table of ippmMeasureTable, and 
	  is responsible for the configuration of the reports. 
	  The reports are saved in the ippmReportTable, or sent directly to the 
	  applications.  


   5.2.7. The Notification Group  

	  The Notification group specifies a list of valid notifications. They 
	  are used to push alarms or reports to the applications. 

   5.3. Row identification in an application namespace 

	  The control protocol or the test protocol adds rows in the namespace 
	  of the corresponding measure. 

	  An identifier of an instance of an object is defined as a list of 
	  objects in the clause INDEX. An object instance identifier in an 
	  owner namespace is defined as a list of objects in the clause INDEX 
	  where the first object type is OwnerString. 

	  As the OBJECT IDENTIFIER, which identifies the instance, begins with 
	  the owner value, the remaining values of the index fields may be 
	  chosen independently from one namespace to another. 

	  This allows the user to choose arbitrary values for the remaining 
	  fields of the INDEX clause without checking that the values of these 
	  fields exists in the MIB tables. This allows the owner to use the 
	  same values across MIB implementations. 

	  Thus, it avoids polling to determine the next free index. Also, as a 
	  consequence, two applications will never find the same free index 
	  value. 

   Stephan/Jewitt     Informational - Expires April 2003          [Page 11] 


   Internet Draft             IPPM reporting MIB              November 2002 



	  The usage of owner namespace increases the speed of the management 
	  operations while reducing bandwidth consumption and CPU load in the 
	  agents and applications. 

	  Measurements are requested by management applications. An instance of 
	  an object managed by a management station is identified by the 
	  management station OwnerString and the private index provided by the 
	  MS. 

	  As the MS manages its private range of indices, it simply chooses one 
	  when it wishes to create a new control entry. For the same reason, 
	  the setup of a measure on several points of measures consists of 
	  simply sending the same copy of the measure setup to the different 
	  points of measures involved.  

   5.4. Relationship of IPPM MIB tables 

	  There is inherently a relationship between various tables in the IPPM 
	  Mib, and as such, the data integrity must be assured. This 
	  relationship is depicted in the following examples. 

   5.4.1. Relationship between the Owners Table and the Measure Table 

	  The owners table contains the list of "owners" that can create and 
	  activate remote IPPM measurements in an agent. As the table is 
	  "Read/Create", these users and their associated  
	  "access" rights on metric measurements can be directly configured. It 
	  is recommended to make use of "view based access control" in order to 
	  restrict access to this table. For example, the  
	  master user "acme" may be given "write" privileges on the 
	  ippmOwnersTable, whereas all others are restricted to "read" access.  
	  The user "acme" can then setup the list of other users that have 
	  access to measures.  

	  There must be at least 1 owner in the owners table. This owner may be 
	  either setup by default by the IPPM agent, or configured as stated 
	  above. 
	  An owner may have multiple corresponding entries in the measure 
	  table. Each entry in the measure table must be associated with one, 
	  and only one, entry in the owners table. That is to say, that a 
	  defined measure may NOT have multiple owners. 







	  Thus, we have a 1:N relationship between the owners table and the 
	  measure table.

   5.4.2. Relationship between the Measure Table and the Network Measure 
		  Table/Aggregated Measure Table 

	  The network measure table and the aggregated measure table can be 
	  seen as logical "extensions" to the measure table.  
	  The measure table contains information that is common to both types 
	  of measurements. The information found in the Network Measure Table 
	  and the Aggregated Measure Table is specific to each type of measure.   

	  As the network measure table is read-only, entries in this table must 
	  be populated by the agent upon startup. 
	  The agent could potentially read a database that contains network 
	  measures configured by a 3rd party proprietary management system that 
	  directly interacts with the points of measure. An entry can not be 
	  created in the network measure table without creating the 
	  corresponding entry in the measure table associated to the measure. 
	  This also implies that the "owner" of the measure be defined in the 
	  owners table.  

	  The aggregated measure table allows for an "owner" to create 
	  aggregated measures (such as average, minimum, maximum) on existing 
	  measures that are in the measure table. If an "owner" (A) wishes to 
	  create an aggregated measure on a measure "owned" by another  
	  "owner" (B), then "owner" (B) must grant "owner" (A) access to his 
	  measures. This can be done in the resultsharing table. 

	  Even though the Measure Table is read-create, an "owner" should only 
	  be able to create, or modify entries in the measure table that 
	  correspond to aggregated measure types. Should an "owner" attempt to 
	  update an entry in the measure table that corresponds to an entry 
	  in the network measure table, than access should be denied.

	  As the aggregated measure table essentially "inherits" from the 
	  measure table, one can not create an entry is this table without 
	  first creating an entry in the measure table. Likewise, one can not 
	  delete an entry in the measure table without first deleting the 
	  corresponding row in the aggregated measure table. This logic ensures 
	  that there are no "orphaned" table entries in the aggregated measure 
	  table.

	  The managed objects of the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB are the measures and 
	  the results.

   6.2. Conceptual programming interface 

	  This section describes a conceptual programming interface for the 
	  integration of the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB in a point of measure. 

   6.2.1. Measure control 

	  A measure is created/deleted/suspended through the ControlMeasure() 
	  call.  

   6.2.2. Result log 

	  A result of a measure is created in the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB History 
	  table using a CreateResult() call. Results belonging to a measure are 
	  managed according to the setup of the measure. 

   6.2.3. Reporting 

	  Results are reported using the method GetResult(), 
	  GetMeasureMetricResults() and GetMeasureResults() respectively to get 
	  a singleton result, the singleton result of a metric measure,  and 
	  finally to get the singleton result of a measure.                     

   6.2.4. Logical calls 

	  Objects are managed using 5 main primitives:    

		   controlMeasure(); 
		   CreateResult(); 
		   GetResult(); 
		   GetMeasureMetricResults(); 
		   GetMeasureResults(). 

   6.3. SNMP mapping 

	  ControlMeasure() corresponds to a SNMP set-request on a conceptual 
	  row of ippmMeasureEntry and on a conceptual row of  
	  ippmNetworkMeasureEntry. 

	  CreateResult() is a internal interface for adding measure results in 
	  the ippmHistoryTable. 

	  GetResult() corresponds to an SNMP get-request on a result. 

	  GetMeasureMetricResults() corresponds to a SNMP walk on the results 
	  of a metric measure subtree. 

	  GetMeasureResults() corresponds to a SNMP walk on the results of a 
	  measure subtree.

   7. Measurement architectures 

	  There are four main measurement architectures. 

   7.1. Proxy architecture 


					+----+                       +----+ 
					|NMS1|                       |NMS2|

					  |                           | 
					  +----------+     +----------+

								 |     | 
								 v     v 
						+--------------------------+ 
						| IPPM-REPORTING-MIB agent | 
						+--------------------------+ 
								 ^     ^ 
								 |     | 
							   OWDP-Control 
								 |     | 
					  +----------+     +----------+ 
					  |                           |         
					  v                           v 
		   +----------------+              +------------------+ 
		   | Packets-Sender |--OWDP-Test-->| Packets-Receiver | 
		   +----------------+              +------------------+ 

	  In this architecture, the different NMSÆs query the IPPM-REPORTING-
	  MIB agent for measurements. The agent controls whether the NMS is 
	  granted access to perform the measure requested. Each NMS accesses 
	  the results of its measurements in the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB statistics 
	  table. 

	  The measurement setup/teardown and the data collection are done using 
	  the control protocol and the test protocol. 

	  In this mode the NMS does not depend either on the control protocol 
	  nor on the test protocol. The entities involved in the measurement do 
	  not need to implement the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB nor SNMP. This mode 
	  allows for lightweight implementation in the point of measure, and 
	  also for heterogeneous control protocols to coexist. 

	  Finally, the proxy is a checkpoint where measurement activity may be 
	  logged, and where access to measurement setups may be tightly

	  controlled. Thus, it provides a reliable architecture to manage the 
	  security of a measurement system. 


   7.2. Reporting architecture 

   In this architecture the SNMP protocol is only used to read the results 
   of the measurements in the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB History Table, and also to 
   inform the NMS that an event has occurred.

   The activation of a measure by the control protocol or the test protocol 
   creates a measure in the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB Measure table. The table in 
   question may be not accessible by SNMP. In this case, a list of the 
   measure identifiers (owner, index) is handled by the measurement 
   software. 

   Each timestamped result of the measure is logged on the fly in the IPPM-
   REPORTING-MIB History table in order to allow read access to the NMSÆs 
   and event handling. 

   On completion, the measurement results are managed according to the 
   measure setup:

			  + The results may be sent to an NMS using a SNMP Trap PDU or 
			  a SNMP Inform PDU. The NMS may be the sender entity or the 
			  control entity; 
			  + They may be dropped from the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB History 
			  table. 

   In this mode, it is recommended to use an SNMPv2 Inform PDU to send the 
   result because it ensures that the entire block of the result is 
   received. There is no control using SNMP Trap PDU.     

   Also, in this mode, it is recommended to implement the IPPM-REPORTING-
   MIB Measure table in read only in order to allow an NMS to read the 
   status of their measures.

   The NMS measurement queries are registered in the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB 
   scheduler and performed by the control and the test protocol. The NMS 
   directly consults the result in the corresponding points of measure. 

   7.4. Security 

   The proxy mode provides flexibility and control of the access to the 
   points of measure, while allowing lightweight control protocol and test 
   protocol implementations in the points of measure. Different security 
   rules may be applied to the NMS domain and to measurement system 
   domains. 

   The reporting mode has 2 security domains: 

   Stephan/Jewitt     Informational - Expires April 2003          [Page 21] 


   Internet Draft             IPPM reporting MIB              November 2002 


	  +The control of the measurement setups relies on the control and the 
	  test protocol security mechanisms.  
	  + The control of access to the results depends on the SNMP security 
	  mechanisms. 

   The gateway mode security relies on the security of the proxy mode and 
   of the reporting mode. 

   8. Reporting mode integration with the control and test protocols 

   The IPPM-REPORTING-MIB standardizes the parameters that: 

			  + Define the configuration of the IPPM metrics measures; 
			  + Define the format of the results of the measure; 
			  + Define the report of the IPPM metric measures results. 

   It introduces the concept of owner namespace to allow for fast 
   configuration and reporting across multiple points of measurement.  

   A measure is a distributed object describing a task to be performed by 
   the control and the test protocols. A measure is identified by its owner 
   and its owner index. This identifier is the same in all the points of 
   measure. As the owner chooses the index, there is no need for 
   negotiation between the NMS and the points of measure before activating 
   the measure. 

   A measure is primarily defined by its identifier, the metrics to 
   measure, the description of the end point addresses and the description 
   of the scheduling of the measure. 



   The description of the measure is distributed to the points of measure 
   involved. The distribution may not be synchronized. 

   8.1. Integration  

   The control protocol, test protocol and the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB share the 
   same semantic. 

   The integration of the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB, and the test and control 
   protocols, relies on the use of the conceptual programming interface 
   described in section 6. It consists in pushing the measure 
   setup/teardown parameters and the result values from the measurement 
   software to the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB agent. 

   8.2. Setup of the measure  

   The creation of the measure consists only in transferring the measure 
   description from the measurement software to the MIB. The management of 
   the measure is done using the ControlMeasure().  

   Stephan/Jewitt     Informational - Expires April 2003          [Page 22] 


   Internet Draft             IPPM reporting MIB              November 2002 



   The protocol, which provides the parameters of the measure to manage, 
   may be the control protocol of the test protocol. 

   Different frameworks may be used to setup a measure.  

   8.2.1. Synchronous setup 

   The control protocol sets up the measure both in the sender and the 
   receiver before the measurement. 

   8.2.2. Asynchronous setup 

   The control protocol sets up the measure only in the sender. In this 
   case, the receiver has a service already activated (or pending )for the 
   typeP of the measurement.  

   As the first test packet includes the description of the measure, it may 
   differ from regular test packets. If the first test packet is not 
   consistent with the regular test packets, it must not be used for 
   performing metrics measurement. 

   8.3. Setup of the measurement report 

   The report description is an extension to the definition of a measure. 
   It describes the event and the data to include in the report. A report 
   is read by an NMS in the ippmReportTable, or pushed to a NMS using a 
   SNMP Trap PDU, a SNMP Inform PDU, an email, or a SMS. 

   The control protocol, or the test protocol, includes the description of 
   the report in the setup of the measure.  

   Different types of reports may be combined: 

			  + A trivial report defines the results to be saved in the 
			  ippmReportTable; 
			  + A basic report defines the host to which the results are 
			  pushed on completion of the measure; 
			  + An alarm report defines a threshold on the results of the 
			  measure. A message is sent to a host when the result raises 
			  or fall the threshold; 
			  + An SLA report defines a threshold on the results of the 
			  measure. The events are filtered using a staircase method. 
			  The report consists in the results of the measure (time and 
			  value) of the filtered events. The reports are sent at each 
			  measure cycle or when the measure completes. 

   8.4. Writing the measurement results in the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB  

   Results have to be written by the measurement task in the agent 
   implementing the IPPM MIB.  

   Stephan/Jewitt     Informational - Expires April 2003          [Page 23] 


   Internet Draft             IPPM reporting MIB              November 2002 



   Adding the results of a measurement consists in the transfer of the 
   result from the measurement software to the agent. The protocol that 
   provides the result may be the control protocol, or the test protocol.  

   Writing a result is done using the CreateResult(). 

   8.5. Report download and upload 

   A report is read in the ippmReportTable using SNMP, or pushed by the 
   IPPM_MIB agent using a SNMP Trap PDU, a SNMP Inform PDU, an email or a 
   SMS. 

   8.6. Default value 

	  The default values correspond to Ipv4 best effort.

   The timestamp format is directly inspired from the NTP timestamp format. 
   It differs because it counts the second since 1 Jan 2000 0H00 instead of 1 Jan 1900 
   0H00. The most significant bit of the part that represents the second is reserved. It 
   will wrap in year 2068 (The NTP timestamp will wrap in year 2036).  

   This bit is set to indicate if the fractional part of the second contains a precision 
   field and a synchronization field as initially proposed in the OWAMP draft.  

   When this bit is not set the resolution is maximal. 

   The maximal resolution is close to 250 picoseconds.

	   DESCRIPTION 
   "This textual convention is used to describe the protocol encapsulation list of a 
   packet, and is used as the value of the SYNTAX clause for the type of the Src and Dst 
   of an IPPM measure. The RFC2895 specifies a macro for the definition of protocol 
   identifiers while its companion document, the RFC2896 defines a set of protocol 
   identifiers. 

   Notes: An IPPM TypeP does not differ from RMON2 Protocol identifiers, but TypeP usage 
   in IPPM MIB differs from Protocol identifier usage in RMON2. A IPPM measure is active, 
   so generally TypeP does not describe the link layer (i.e. ether2...). Valid Internet 
   packets are sent from Src to Dst. Then the choice of the link layer relies on the 
   Internet stack.  

   For example, the RFC2896 defines the protocol identifier 
   '16.0.0.0.1.0.0.8.0.0.0.0.6.0.0.0.23.3.0.0.0' which represents ether2.ip.tcp.telnet 
   and the protocol identifier 16.0.0.0.1.0.0.8.0.0.0.0.4.0.0.0.17.3.0.0.0 which stands 
   for ether2.ip.ipip4.udp. The corresponding TypeP are

   IppmHistoryValue is the value of the metric measured at the time ippmHistoryTimestamp. 

   Example: <TODO provide an example with a stream of one way result for the same 
   measure> 
   A one way delay measure is created by the entity 'acme' using the owner index 1 and 
   setting the 6th bit (corresponding to One-way-Delay) of ippmMeasureMetrics to 1. 
   Consider that the first result of the one way delay measured for acme on the day 15 of 
   June at 8h20mn 10s 50ms is 23. The result is identified as the singleton 
   ippmHistoryValue.acme.1.6.1 and stored with value 23. 

   Its value may be retrieved using a get-next(ippmHistoryValue.acme.1.6) which returns 
   (ippmHistoryValue.acme.1.6.1 == 23). The IppmMetricsIndex value of '6' corresponds to 
   the 6th metric of ippmMetricsTable which is Type-P-One-way-Delay.

   report consists of the results of the measure which have been saved in the

		   The message sent is a notification defined in the ippmNotifications node. The

   + Singleton events are sent using the notification ippmSingletonAlarm 
   + Exceeded events durations are sent using the notification

   + A report of a cycle of measure is sent using the notification 
   ippmCycleOfMeasureReport 
   + A report of a complete measure is sent using the notification 
   ippmCompletedMeasureReport 

		   Example 1: 
		   The setup of an alarm to be sent to the owner in a SNMP Trap each time the 
   staircase crosses the metric threshold value of 5: 

				   ippmReportSetupMetricThreshold 5 
				   ippmReportSetupDefinition { 
						   onSingleton(1), 
						   reportOnlyUptoDownMetricResults(4), 
						   inSNMPTrapPDU(8) 
				   } 

		   Example 2: 
		   The setup of a report to be sent to the owner in a SNMP informRequestPDU per 
   measure cycle. It reports the staircase values corresponding to a metric threshold of 
   5: 

				   ippmReportSetupMetricThreshold 5 
				   ippmReportSetupDefinition { 
						   onMeasureCycle(2), 
						   reportOnlyUptoDownMetricResults(4), 
						   inInformRequestPDU(10), 
						   clearHistory(13) 
				   } 

		   Default report: 
		   The default report provides the control protocol with an implicit mechanism 
   to forward the result of a cycle of measure to the owner of the measure while deleting 
   the results from the ippmHistoryTable on reception of the response to the 
   InformRequestPDU :

   10. Security Considerations 

   10.1. Privacy 

	  The privacy concerns of network measurement are intrinsically limited 
	  by the active measurements. Unlike passive measurements, there can be 
	  no release of existing user data. 


   10.2. Measurement aspects 

	  Conducting Internet measurements raises both security and privacy 
	  concerns. This memo does not specify an implementation of the 
	  metrics, so it does not directly affect the security of the Internet 


   Stephan/Jewitt     Informational - Expires April 2003          [Page 58] 


   Internet Draft             IPPM reporting MIB              November 2002 


	  nor of applications that run on the Internet. However, 
	  implementations of these metrics must be mindful of security and 
	  privacy concerns. 

	   There are two types of security concerns: potential harm caused by 
	  the measurements, and potential harm to the measurements. The 
	  measurements could cause harm because they are active, and inject 
	  packets into the network. The measurement parameters MUST be 
	  carefully selected so that the measurements inject trivial amounts of 
	  additional traffic into the networks they measure. If they inject 
	  "too much" traffic, they can skew the results of the measurement, and 
	  in extreme cases cause congestion and denial of service. 

	   The measurements themselves could be harmed by routers giving 
	  measurement traffic a different priority than "normal" traffic, or by 
	  an attacker injecting artificial measurement traffic. If routers can 
	  recognize measurement traffic and treat it separately, the 
	  measurements will not reflect actual user traffic. If an attacker 
	  injects artificial traffic that is accepted as legitimate, the loss 
	  rate will be artificially lowered. Therefore, the measurement 
	  methodologies SHOULD include appropriate techniques to reduce the 
	  probability measurement traffic can be distinguished from "normal" 
	  traffic.  

	  Authentication techniques, such as digital signatures, may be used 
	  where appropriate to guard against injected traffic attacks. 


   10.3. Management aspects 

	  There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that 
	  have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-only. Such objects 
	  may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
	  environments. The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
	  environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
	  network operations. 

	   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the network 
	  itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no 
	  control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and 
	  GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.  

	   It is recommended that the implementors consider the security 
	  features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically, the use 
	  of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [18] and the View-based 
	  Access Control Model RFC 2575 [21] is recommended.  

	   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP 
	  entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly 
	  configured to give access to the objects only to those principals

	  Put in a description of the relationship of certain tables, 
	  particularly the measure/network measure/aggregated measure table. 

	  The TC GMTTimeStamp is the common type to define timestamp objects. 

	  ippmHisoryTable index simplified: ippmHistoryTimestamp replaced with 
	  ippmHistorySqceNdx in the index. 

	  The MIB has been compiled using net-snmp. 

	  Snmpadminstring replaces Displaystring. 

	  IP addresses defined using INETaddresstype. 

	  Sharing table is optional to permit the VACM framework to be used.

	  The description of the network measure table emphases that the set up 
	  of network measure is not permitted using SNMP. 

	  The TC StandardMetrics is removed and replaced with the table 
	  ippmMetricsTable. 


	  The table pointOfMeasureTable is added to describe multiples 
	  interfaces devices 

	  5 tables have been changed to read/create: ippmOwnersTable, 
	  ippmMeasureTable, ippmAggregatedMeasureTable, ippmResultSharingTable, 
	  and ippmReportSetupTable. 


	  IppmHistoryTable and ippmReportTable index reviews: 
		   IppmHistorySqceNdx field added in the ippmHistoryTable. 
		   INDEX modified. IppmHistorySqceNdx replaces IppmHistoryTimemark. 

	  IppmSystem group refurbished: 
		   IppmSystemTimer renamed ippmSystemTime. 
		   Current and last synch event concept generalized in the 
		   ippmSynchronizationTable.
