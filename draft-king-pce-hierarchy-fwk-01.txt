Abstract

   Computing optimum routes for Label Switched Paths (LSPs) across
   multiple domains in Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineering
   (MPLS-TE) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks presents a problem
   because no single point of path computation is aware of all of the
   links and resources in each domain. A solution may be achieved using
   the Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture.

   Where the sequence of domains is known, a priori, various techniques
   can be employed to derive an optimum path. If the domains are 
   simply- connected, or if the preferred points of interconnection are
   also known, the Per-Domain Path Computation technique can be used. 
   Where there are multiple connections between domains and there is 
   no preference for the choice of points of interconnection, the 
   Backward Recursive Path Computation Procedure (BRPC) can be used.

   This document examines techniques to establish the optimum path when
   the sequence of domains is not known in advance. The document       
   provides mechanisms that allow the optimum sequence of domains to be
   selected and the optimum end-to-end path to be derived.

1. Introduction

   The capability to compute, establish and control end-to-end inter-
   domain Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE)
   and Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) paths, using a
   Path Computation Element is well known. The Path Computation Element
   (PCE) architecture is defined in [RFC4655]. The methods for
   establishing and controlling inter-domain MPLS and GMPLS are
   documented in [RFC4726]

   In a multi-domain environment, a PCE can be used to compute 
   end-to-end paths using a per-domain path computation technique 
   [RFC5152]. Alternatively, the backward recursive path computation 
   (BRPC) mechanism [RFC5441] allows multiple PCEs to collaborate in 
   order to select an optimal end-to-end path that crosses multiple 
   domains.

   A domain can be defined as separate administrative, geographic, or
   switching environment within the network. A domain may be further
   defined as a zone of routing or computational ability. These might be
   categorized as an Antonymous System (AS) or an Interior Gateway
   Protocol (IGP) [RFC4726] and [RFC4655]. Domains are connected through
   ingress and egress boundary nodes (BNs).
   
   This document examines techniques to establish the optimum path when
   the sequence of domains is not known in advance. It documents the
   architecture and mechanisms necessary to allow the optimum sequence 
   of domains to be selected and the optimum end-to-end path to be 
   derived.
   
   The model proposed in this document is applicable to environments 
   with small groups of domains (where visibility is limited from the 
   ingress LSR). Applying the hierarchical PCE model to large groups of 
   domains such as the Internet, is not feasible or relevant. 
   
1.1 Problem Statement 

   Using a PCE to compute a path between nodes within a single domain is
   relatively straightforward. Computing an end-to-end path when the
   source and destination nodes are located in different domains 
   requires co-operation between multiple PCEs, each responsible for 
   its own domain.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
King and Farrel                                                 [Page 3]
draft-king-hierarchy-fwk-01.txt                              July 2009
  
  
   Both techniques, assume that the sequence of domains to be crossed
   from source to destination is well known. No explanation is given of
   how this sequence is generated or what criteria may be used for the
   selection of paths between domains. In small clusters of domains, 
   such as simple cooperation between adjacent ISPs, this selection 
   process is not complex. In more advanced deployments (such as 
   optical networks constructed from multiple sub-domains, or multi-
   AS environments)the choice of domains in the end-to-end domain 
   sequence can be critical to the determination of an optimum 
   end-to-end path.

   The document introduces the concept of a hierarchical PCE 
   architecture and shows how to coordinate PCEs in peer domains in 
   order to derive an optimal end-to-end path. The work is currently 
   scoped to operate with a small group of domains and there is no 
   intent to apply this model to a large group of domains, e.g., 
   the Internet.

1.2 Definition of a Domain

   A domain is defined in [RFC4726] as any collection of network 
   elements within a common sphere of address management or path 
   computational responsibility.  Examples of such domains include 
   IGP areas and Autonomous Systems.  Wholly or partially overlapping
   domains e.g., path computation sub-domains of areas or ASes are 
   not within the scope of this document.

   In the context of GMPLS, a particularly important example of a domain
   is the ASON subnetwork [G-8080]. In this case computation of an
   end-to-end path requires the selection of nodes and links within a
   parent domain where some nodes may in fact be subnetwork. Furthermore
   a domain might be an ASON routing area [G-7715]. A PCE may perform 
   the path computation function of an ASON routing controller as 
   described in [G-7715-2].

   This document assumes that the selection of a sequence of domains for
   an end-to-end path is in some sense a hierarchical path computation
   problem. That is, where one mechanism is used to determine across a
   domain a separate mechanism (or at least a separate set of paradigms)
   is used to determine the sequence of domains.

1.3 Requirements

   Networks are often constructed from multiple domains. These 
   domains are often interconnected via multiple interconnect points. 
   Its assumed that the sequence of domains are not always well-known.

   The traffic engineering properties of a domain cannot be seen from 
   outside the domain. Traffic engineering aggregation or abstraction, 
   hides information and leads to failed path setup. Flooding TE 
   information breaks confidentiality and does not scale in the 
   routing protocol and in the aggregation process 
  
King and Farrel                                                 [Page 4]
draft-king-hierarchy-fwk-01.txt                              July 2009
  
   
   The primary goal of this document is to define how to derive optimal
   end-to-end multi-domain paths when the sequence of domains is not
   known. The solution needs to be scalable, maintain internal  
   domain topology confidentiality while providing the optimal end-
   to-end path.

1.3.1 Metric Objectives
   
   The definition of optimality is dependent on policy and will be 
   based on a single objective or a group objectives. An objective 
   may be requested during the path computation request. The 
   following objectives have been initially identified but the list 
   may be expanded in future versions of this document: 
   
   * Minimum cost path
   * Minimum load path
   * Maximum residual bandwidth path
   * Minimize aggregate bandwidth consumption
   * Minimize the number of border routers used
   * Limit the number of domains crossed

1.3.2 Domain Diversity

   Domain diversity should facilitate the selection of paths that share
   ingress and egress domains, but do not share transit domains. This
   provides a way to ensure domain diversity for most of the path of the
   LSP.

1.3.3 Domain Path Diversity

   Domain path selection should provide the capability to include or
   exclude specific border nodes, for an example to ensure path 
   diversity for the path of the label switched path (LSP).

1.3.4 Existing Traffic Engineering Constraints

   Any solution should take advantage of typical traffic engineering
   constraints (hop count, bandwidth, lambda continuity, path cost,
   etc.[RFC4655]

1.3.5 Commercial Constraints

   The solution should provide the capability to include commercially
   relevant constraints such as policy, SLAs, security, peering
   preferences, and dollar costs. 
   
   Additionally it may be necessary for the service provider to 
   request that specific domains are included or excluded based on 
   commercial relationships, security implications, and reliability.   

King and Farrel                                                 [Page 5]
draft-king-hierarchy-fwk-01.txt                              July 2009


1.3.6 Domain Confidentiality

   A key requirement is the ability to maintain domain confidentiality 
   when computing inter-domain end-to-end paths. When required by local 
   policy, a PCE should not need to disclose to any other PCE the intra-
   domain paths it computes or the internal topology of the domain it 
   serves..

1.4 Terminology

   This document uses PCE terminology defined in [RFC4655], [RFC4875],
   and [RFC5440]. Additional terms are defined below and draw on the
   concepts set out for P2MP LSPs in [RFC4461].

   Boundary Nodes: Each Domain has entry LSRs and exit LSRs that can
   either be ABRs or ASBRs. They are defined here as Boundary Nodes
   (BNs).

   Entry BN of domain(n): a BN connecting domain(n-1) to domain(n)
   along a determined sequence of domains.

   Exit BN of domain(n): a BN connecting domain(n) to domain(n+1)
   along a determined sequence of domains.

   OF: Objective Function: A set of one or more optimization criterion
   (criteria) used for the computation of a single path (e.g. path cost
   minimization), or the synchronized computation of a set of paths
   (e.g. aggregate bandwidth consumption minimization, etc.). See
   [RFC4655] and [RFC5541].

   Domain Path: The known sequence of domains for a path.

   Egress Domain: The domain that includes the egress LSR.

   Root Domain: The domain that includes the ingress LSR.

   Transit Domain: A domain that has an upstream and downstream 
   neighbour domain.

2. Per Domain Path Computation

   The per-domain path computation method for establishing inter-Domain
   TE-LSPs [RFC5152] defines a technique for establishing an 
   inter-domain GMPLS TE Label Switched Path (LSP) whereby the path is
   computed during the signalling process on a per-domain basis by the
   entry boundary node of each domain (each node responsible for 
   triggering the computation of a section of an inter-domain TE LSP 
   path is always along the path of such TE LSP). Domain boundary LSRs
   may have different computation capabilities, run different path 
   computation algorithms, apply different sets of constraints and 
   optimization criteria, etc.

   During per domain path computation each border node must perform a
   computation and invoke its PCE. Each PCE selects the first 
   available path, even though the path might be met the minimum 
   constraints requested it may not represent the optimal path. 
   Ultimately per domain path computation may lead to sub-optimal 
   paths. 

   In the case that the domain path (in particular the sequence of 
   border nodes) is not known. A PCE must select an exit border node, 
   based on some determination of how to reach the destination that 
   is outside [RFC5152] the domain of which the PCE has computational
   responsibility. [RFC5152] suggest that this might be achieved using
   the IP shortest path as advertise by BGP. Not however that the
   existence of an IP forwarding path does guarantee the presence of
   sufficient bandwidth, let alone an optimal TE path. Furthermore in
   many GMPLS systems inter-domain IP routing will not be present. 
   Thus, per domain path computation may require a significant 
   crankback attempts to establish even a sub-optimal TE path.

   Per domain path computation may suit simply-connected domains and 
   where the preferred points of interconnection are known


3. Backwards Recursive Path Computation

   The PCE-based Backwards Recursive Path Computation procedure 
   [RFC5441] also applies to the computation of an optimal constrained
   inter-domain TE LSP. The sequence of domains to be traversed can 
   either be determined before or during the path computation 
   procedure. The BRPC procedure communicates between cooperating 
   PCEs in order to compute the end-to-end path across multiple 
   domains.






King and Farrel                                                 [Page 7]
draft-king-hierarchy-fwk-01.txt                              July 2009


   In the case where the sequence of domains is known. The source PCC
   (Path Computation Client) sends a path computation requests to the
   PCE responsible for its domain. This request is then forwarded
   between PCEs, domain-by-domain, to the PCE responsible for the
   destination domain. The PCE in the destination domain creates a
   Virtual Shortest Path Tree (VSPT), a tree of potential paths, to
   the destination and passes this back to the previous PCE. As the
   VSPT is passed back towards the source domain each PCE adds to the
   VSPT until it reached the PCE in the source domain uses the VSPT to
   select an end-to-end path that it sends to the initiating PCC.
   
   BRPC may suit environments where multiple connections exist between 
   domains and there is no preference for the choice of points of 
   interconnection.

3.1. Applicability of BRPC when the Domain Path is Not Known

   As described above BRPC can be used to determine an optimal
   inter-domain path when the sequence is known. Even when the sequence
   of domains is not known BRPC could be used as follows.

   - PCC sends PC request to its local PCE (ingress PCE)
   - The ingress PCE sends the path computation request direct to the 
     PCE responsible for the domain containing the destination node 
     (egress PCE)
   - The egress PCE computes an egress VSPT and passes it to a PCE
     responsible for each of the adjacent domains.
   - Each PCE in turn constructs a VSPT and passes it on to all of its
     neighboring PCEs.
   - When the ingress PCE has received a VSPT from each of its
     neighboring domains it is able to select the optimum path.

   Clearly this mechanism (which could be called path computation
   flooding) has significant scaling issues. It could be improved by 
   the application of policy and filtering but such mechanisms are not 
   simple and would still leave scaling concerns.


4. Hierarchical PCE

   In the hierarchical PCE architecture, a Parent (hierarchical) 
   PCE maintains a domain topology map. The domain topology map contains 
   the Child domains, seen as nodes, and their interconnections. The 
   Parent PCE has no information about the contents of the Child 
   domains. The Parent PCE is aware of the TE capabilities of the 
   Child domain interconnections. 
  
  
  
  
  
King and Farrel                                                 [Page 8]
draft-king-hierarchy-fwk-01.txt                              July 2009

 
   Each domain has a PCE responsible for computing paths across it. 
   These PCEs are known as Child PCEs and have a relationship with the 
   Parent PCE. Each Child PCE also knows the identity of the domains 
   that neighbor its own domain. One Child PCE cannot know the topology
   of another Child domain. Child PCEs are also not aware of the general 
   domain mesh connectivity.

   The Parent PCE learns from configuration or from each Child PCE how 
   the domains are interconnected including the traffic engineering (TE) 
   capabilities of domain interconnections, but does not know the 
   contents of the domains. Discovery of the domain topology and 
   interconnections is discussed further in section 5.3.
   
   When a path is needed outside of the ingress domain, the ingress 
   PCE sends a PCEP request the parent PCE. The Parent PCE computes a 
   domain path based on the current domain topology. The Parent PCE 
   selects candidate domain paths; it then sends computation requests 
   to the Child PCEs responsible for the domains on any candidate domain
   path.


5. Hierarchical PCE Procedures 

5.1 Objective Functions and Policy

   Deriving the optimal end-to-end domain path sequence will be 
   dependent on the policy applied during the domain path 
   computation. An Objective Function (OF), or set of OFs may be applied 
   in order to define the policy being applied to the domain path 
   computation.
       
   The OF specifies the desired outcome of the computation. It does 
   not describe the algorithm to use. When computing end-to-end inter
   -domain paths, required OFs may include:
  
   - Minimum cost path
   - Minimum load path
   - Maximum residual bandwidth path
   - Minimize aggregate bandwidth consumption
   - Minimize the number of border routers used

   Limit on number of domains crossed
   - Initially set by admin
   - Length of the shortest path found so far

   The objective function may be requested by the PCC, the ingress 
   domain PCE (according to local policy), or a maybe applied by the 
   Parent PCE according to inter-domain policy. 



King and Farrel                                                 [Page 9]
draft-king-hierarchy-fwk-01.txt                              July 2009


5.2 Maintaining Domain Confidentiality

   A Parent PCE is aware of the topology and connections between 
   domains, but is not aware of the contents of the domains. Child 
   domains are completely confidential. One Child PCE cannot know the 
   topology of another Child domain. Child domains do not know the 
   general domain mesh connectivity.
   
   As described in early sections of this document, PCEs can exchange 
   path information in order to achieve end-to-end inter-domain 
   connectivity. Each path fragment, per domain, reveals information 
   about a domain. Some management regions or ASes will not want to 
   share this information. A PCE can replace a path segment with a 
   path-key instead of the full path according to [RFC5520]. This   
   mechanism effectively hides the content of a segment of a path.

5.3 PCE Discovery

   It is a simple matter for each Child PCE to be configured with the
   address of its Parent PCE. Typically, there will only be one or two
   Parents of any Child.

   The Parent PCE also needs to be aware of the Child PCEs for all Child
   domains that it can see. This information is most likely to be 
   configured (as part of the administrative definition of each 
   domain). 
   
   The Parent PCE also needs to know the inter-domain connectivity. 
   This information could be configured with suitable policy and 
   commercial rules, or could be learned from the Child PCEs as 
   described in Section 4.
   
   Consideration of discovery of Parent PCE relationships, 
   between Parent PCEs and Child PCEs, is for future study. 
   Mechanisms that rely on advertising or querying PCE locations across 
   domains or provider boundaries are undesirable.
   
   In order for the Parent PCE to learn about domain interconnection 
   the Child PCE will report the identity of its neighbor domains. The
   IGP in each neighbor domain can advertise its inter-domain TE link 
   capability.
   
   Multi-domain and multi-provider discovery is undesirable due to 
   security and scalability issues.

draft-king-hierarchy-fwk-01.txt                              July 2009


5.4 Domain Traffic Engineering Abstraction

   The Parent PCE maintains a topology map of the Child domains 
   and their interconnectivity. Where inter-domain connectivity is 
   provide by TE links the capabilities of those links must also be 
   known to the Parent PCE. Furthermore the Parent domain 
   may contain nodes and links in its own right. Therefore, the 
   Parent PCE maintains a traffic engineering database (TED) for
   its domain in the same way that any PCE does.

   The mechanism for building the parent TED is likely to rely heavily
   on administrative configuration and commercial issues.  However in
   models such as ASON, it is possible to consider a separate instance
   of an IGP running within the parent domain where the participating
   protocol speakers are the nodes directly present in that domain and
   the PCEs (routing controllers) responsible for each of the Child 
   domains. 

5.5 Determination of Destination Domain 

   The source node (PCC) is aware of the identity of the destination 
   node. If it knows the destination domain it can supply this 
   information as part of the PCEP request. However, if it does not 
   know the destination domain this information must be determined by 
   the PCEs.

   In some specialist topologies the Parent PCE could determine the 
   destination domain based on the destination address, for example from
   configuration. However this is not appropriate for many multi-domain
   addressing scenarios. In IP based multi-domain networks the 
   Parent PCE may be able to determine the destination domain by 
   participating in inter-domain routing. Finally, the Parent PCE could
   issue specific requests to the Child PCEs to discover if they contain
   the destination node. 

   This topic will require continued study.

5.6 Hierarchical PCE Examples

   Figure 1 demonstrates four interconnected domains within a fifth 
   Parent domain. Each domain contains a PCE.

   - Domain 1 is the ingress domain and contains Child PCE 1. Its
     neighbours are domain 2 (with Child PCE 2) and Domain 4 (with Child
     PCE 4. The domain also contains the source (S) label switch router 
    (LSR) and three egress border nodes (BN11, B12 and BN13).

   - Domain 2 contains Child PCE 2. Its neighbours are domain 1 (with
     Child PCE 1) and domain 3 (with Child PCE 3). The domain also
     contains two ingress border nodes (BN21 and BN22) and two egress 
     border nodes (BN23 and BN24).

   - Domain 3 is the egress domain and contains Child PCE 3. Its 
     neighbours are domain 2 (with Child PCE 2) and domain 4 (with Child 
     PCE 4). The domain also contains the destination (D) label switch 
     router (LSR) and three ingress border nodes (BN31, BN32 and BN33).

   - Domain 4 contains Child PCE 4. Its neighbours are domain 2 (with
     Child PCE 2) and domain 3 (with Child PCE 3). The domain also 
     contains an ingress border node (BN41) and an egress border node  
    (BN42).

   All of these domains are encompassed within Domain 5 which contains 
   the Parent PCE (PCE 5).

   Figure 2, demonstrates the view of the domain topology as seen by 
   Parent PCE (PCE 5). This view is an abstracted topology; PCE 5 is 
   aware of domain connectivity but not of the internal topology within
   each domain.

   Figure 2 Abstract Domain Topology as Seen by the Parent PCE

5.6.1 Hierarchical PCE Initial Information Exchange

   Based on the Figure 1 topology. The following is an illustration of 
   the initial hierarchical PCE information exchange. 
   
   1. Child PCE 1, the PCE responsible for Domain 1, is configured 
   with the location of its Parent PCE (PCE5).
   
   2. Child PCE 1 establishes contact with its Parent PCE.
   
   3. Child PCE 1 listens to Child IGP and learns its inter-domain 
   connectivity.
   
   4. Child PCE 1 reports its neighbor domain connectivity.
   
   5. Child PCE reports inter-domain link status changes.

   Each Child PCE will perform the steps outlined above so the Parent 
   PCE can create an abstracted domain topology view as described in 
   Figure 2.

5.6.2 Hierarchical PCE End-to-End Path Computation Procedure

   The procedure below is an example of a source LSR (PCC) requesting an 
   end toend path in a multi-domain environment. The topology is 
   represented in Figure 1. It is assumed that the each Child PCE has 
   connected to its Parent PCE and exchanged the initial information 
   required for the Parent PCE to create its abstracted domain 
   topology view.

  
   1. The source (PCC), ingress LSR , sends a request to the PCE 
   responsible for its domain (PCE1) for a path to the 
   destination, egress LSR.
   
   2. PCE 1 determines the destination, is not in domain 1.
   
   3. PCE 1 sends a computation request to its Parent PCE (PCE 5). 
   
   4. PCE 5 determines the likely domain paths.
   
   5. PCE 5 sends an edge to edge a path computation request to PCE 2 
   which is responsible for domain 2 and PCE 4 which is responsible for 
   domain 4.
   
   6. PCE 5 sends a source to an edge path computation request to PCE 1 
   which is responsible for domain 1. 
      
   7. PCE 5 sends an edge to egress request to PCE3 which is responsible 
   for domain 3.
   
   8. PCE 5 correlates all computation request responses and applies 
   any requested policy requirements. 
   
   9. PCE 5 will then select the optimal end-to-end multi-domain path 
   that meets any policy and objective functions and supplies the ERO to 
   PCE 1.
   
   10. PCE 1 will forward the ERO to the source, ingress LSR. 


6. Hierarchical PCE Applicability

6.1 Antonymous Systems

6.2 ASON architecture (G-7715-2)

   The Parent PCE mechanism fits well within the ASON routing 
   architecture. It can be used to provide paths across subnetworks, 
   and to determine end-to-end paths in networks constructed from 
   multiple subnetworks or routing areas. The routing controllers 
   each implement a PCE that can be queried by any Network Element 
   (NE) within the routing area for which the routing controller has 
   responsibility. When a path is needed outside of the domain, the 
   routing controllers use the hierarchical PCE model to fully match 
   the hierarchical routing model of ASON.
