                      PSTNization of the Internet
              draft-rdsx1-intarea-pstnize-internet-01.txt

Abstract

   This draft discusses the features and functions that the Internet
   must support in order to be as robust and trustworthy as the public
   switched telephone network (PSTN, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
   Public_switched_telephone_network).  In general the PSTN-like
   features and functions include verifiable addressing and numbering,
   higher privacy and security, increased reliability (no more than
   around five minutes of unplanned outage over one year time period),
   survivability and resiliency, desirable level of scalability, alarms,
   correlation, and diagnosis capability, and local/international level
   of accountability.  Incorporation of these (or similar) features are
   expected to harden the Internet.

   The topics related to Internet hardening were discussed during IETF88
   technical plenary (http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/88/technical-
   plenary.html) in Vancouver, BC, Canada in Nov. 2013.  A follow-up
   joint W3C/IAB workshop on strengthening the Internet against
   pervasive monitoring (STRINT, https://www.w3.org/2014/strint) was
   held before IETF89 meeting in London, UK.  During the IETF90
   Technical Plenary Session
   (http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/90/minutes/minutes-90-iab-
   techplenary) on Monday, 21 July 2014 in Toronto, Canada the Technical
   Topic discussion focused on Network topology and geography.  The
   presentations revealed that for business relationship and/or policy
   reasons, local traffic routinely cross national borders for so called
   'efficient' routing, thereby facilitating monitoring, copying, and
   surveillance of traffic from users' sessions by both authorized and
   unauthorized entities.  All of the technical presentations are
   available at the website of IETF90
   proceedings(http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/90/slides/slides-90-iab-
   techplenary-9.pdf).

   In this draft, we discuss the requirements for PSTNization of
   Internet interfaces, protocols, services, and management and
   configuration capabilities.

1.  Introduction

   The Internet, as defined in [RFC2026] along with the World Wide Web
   [W3C, http://www.w3.org/] can provide data, text, voice, video, etc.
   services seamlessly to almost everywhere in the World.  Work groups
   like RTCWeb (in IETF, http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/rtcweb/) and
   WebRTC (in W3C) have been enhancing the protocols and interfaces in
   order to enrich Web-based audio, video, collaboration, and gaming
   services.  However, a number of Entities have been utilizing privacy-
   invading Internet innovations (PIIs) in the name of societal and
   economic advancements.  Some of these Entities (e.g., the
   Internet.org) are partnering with local Communities and Non-Profit
   organizations in order to improve bandwidth, connectivity, and
   reachability to all of the inhabitants of the World through wired and
   wireless (mobile) devices.  Consequently, it is becoming increasingly

2.  Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)

   PSTN is hierarchically organized centrally-controlled distributed
   switching network.  CLASS ...  PBX ..  Terminal ...

   PSTN offers circuit switch based communication service.  An end-to-
   end circuit (similar to a tunnel in packet-switched network) must be
   established before a session can be initiated.  The circuit
   establishment, maintenance, and release are achieved through a
   separate network (called SS7 network).  This clear separation between
   signaling and transmission systems has many advantages including
   flexibility, scalability, and accountability.

   Terminal Address: ...

   PBX Address: ...

   CLASS-5 and other Switch Addresses: ...

2.2.  PSTN Interfaces

   The line and circuit interfaces in PSTN are very well-defined (rigid)
   and hence have limited flexibility for rapid adaptation and updates.
   Internet interfaces offer a tremendous amount of flexibility.
   Although this is good for innovation, it offers a paradise for
   hackers, sniffers, and cheaters.

2.4.  PSTN Configuration

   In this section we discuss tools and methods for configuring the PSTN
   switches and services.

2.5.  PSTN Management

   In this section we discuss management aspects of PSTN switches and
   services.

2.6.  PSTN Borders and Safeguards

   In this section we discuss how well-defined and guarded boundaries
   PSTN provides for National (domestic) protection of the services.

2.7.  PSTN Services

   In this section we discuss traditional PSTN services.  Intelligent
   Networking (IN) and Advanced IN (AIN) concepts for service innovation
   are also described.

3.  Enhancing (PSTNIzation) the Internet Services

   In this section we discuss how the PSTN-like features and functions
   can be introduced/incorporated in the Internet.  Of specific interest
   are the logical and physical points and functions that can be
   enhanced so that PSTN-grade hardening can be supported when it is
   desied/required.  A recent draft
   [I-D.khasnabish-dispatch-qoe-management] discusses how end-point's
   intelligence can be utilized for maintaining consistent quality of
   Internet service experience.

3.1.  Addressing and Numbering

   In this section we discuss how address, name and numbers can be
   hardened in the Internet.  Both physical and virtual location may
   need to be associated with the name, address and number of Internet-
   attached points (ports and devices) of interest to make them
   traceable.

3.2.  Service Security and Privacy

   In this section we discuss how Internet domain services can be made
   as secure (or better) and private (or better) as in the PSTN.

   As discussed in [ENISA-14], there is a collusion between the need to
   keep the private data secure and processing in the emerging
   virtualized (cloud or shared resources) network environment, be it
   mobile network or the Internet.  Traditional cryptographic mechanisms
   are not useful for supporting privacy and processing in mobile and
   cloud storage environments over the Internet.

   The emerging technologies like Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE),
   Order Preserving Encryption (OPE), and Delegated and Brokered
   Encryption (DBE) appears to be promising.  However, inherent
   weakness, and dependency on technology and human factors may make
   them equally vulnerable as many of the commonly used cryptographic
   protocols.  A combination of different process, procedures, policies,
   and technologies may offer a better outcome in this gamble.

3.3.  Service Availability

   In this section we discuss how Internet domain services can be made
   as highly available (or better) as in the PSTN.

Internet-Draft           PSTNizing the Internet                June 2015


3.4.  Service Reliability

   In this section we discuss how Internet domain services can be made
   as highly reliable (or better) as in the PSTN.

3.5.  Service Resiliency

   In this section we discuss how Internet domain services can be made
   as highly resilient (or better) as in the PSTN.

3.6.  Accountability for Service

   In this section we discuss how the Internet service providers can be
   made as accountable (or better) as in PSTN.

3.7.  Network Robustness

   In this section we discuss how the Internet domain can be made as
   highly robust (or better) as in the PSTN.

3.8.  Hardening (Local/Domestic) Internet Borders

   In this section we discuss how the local/domestic borders/boundaries
   of the Internet can be hardened for protecting both contents,
   communications (sessions), and other relevant network information.

3.9.  Traceability and Diagnosis

   In this section we discuss how verifiable network and service
   traceability and diagnosis can be incorporated in the Internet.

4.  Service Lifecycle Management

   In this section we discuss the generic lifecycle management of
   Internet services including those of information and packets/flows.

5.  Hardening of the Internet Services APIs

   The APIs of the Internet domain services commonly use open
   interfaces, protocols, profiles, etc.  This offers the desired level
   of flexibility that supports dynamic navigation of sessions/flows
   through a variety of operations systems and physical/virtual
   infrastructure network/service elements.  This also helps achieve
   unified and seamless user experience irrespective of what the
   underlying Internet infrastructure is.  The emerging Cloud reference
   framework [I-D.khasnabish-cloud-reference-framework] discusses these
   in details.

Internet-Draft           PSTNizing the Internet                June 2015


   In this section we discuss how the Internet domain services APIs can
   be hardened in order to provide general PSTN-like reliability and
   trustworthiness without sacrificing the flexibility and openness.

6.  Network Management and Service Orchestration

   In this section we discuss how PSTN-like management and Orchestration
   can be inducted in multi-technology and multi-admin-domain Internet
   environment.

7.  Privacy and Security Considerations

   In order to improve the flexibility and scalability of the Internet,
   the current trend is to utilize virtualization, as discussed in
   [I-D.junsheng-opsawg-virtual-resource-management], and separation of
   control and transport (and forwarding), as discussed in e.g.,
   [RFC3654] and [RFC3746].  It is expected that both capital and
   operational expenditures will be significantly reduced because of
   using virtualization of resources like CPU, memory, storage, links,
   nodes, and value-added service devices like firewall, deep packet
   inspector, deep stats inspector, etc.

   However, the use of virtualization may also make the network
   resources more vulnerable to abuse and spoofing.  For example, the
   security considerations for virtualized resources in data-center
   environment can be found in [I-D.karavettil-vdcs-security-framework].

7.1.  Privacy and Personal Data Protection (PDP) in Digital World

   The initiatives for improving of the Information Society (IS) define
   new requirements to the contemporary information technologies (IT) to
   decide important problems of globalization including field as
   distributed information servicing, remote access to distributed
   environments, sharing and using different public and own resources,
   cloud and mobile cloud computing, social computing, e-learning, etc.
   All these opportunities of contemporary network world expect creation
   of personal profiles and uploading personal information that could be
   accessed by other users, not always in a correct way [Lam].  This
   requires necessity for modernization of data protection rules and
   digital privacy for all participants in the digital world.

   It is possible to ask the question "What are the components of the
   digital world built on the base of the network space?"  Traditional
   component of course is the web-environment that proposes large
   collection of contents, specific and traditional and specialized
   information resources, tools for virtual reality [Garber], etc. that
   could help users obtain some knowledge based on interactive
   communications.



Romansky & Khasnabish   Expires December 30, 2015               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft           PSTNizing the Internet                June 2015


   This collection of means and tools could be extended by opportunities
   of cloud environments and data centres (using remote resources as a
   services) [Chen], social media and Web 2.0 (tools that permit
   collaboration and sharing of information and knowledge between large
   set of users) [Kinast], distributed environments for online/distance
   learning (using and sharing learning content and organize the
   collaboration on the base of specific interests) [Yong], Massive Open
   Online Courses (MOOCs) that many educational institutions apply; the
   tendency is that MOOCs will change the higher education in the coming
   years [Meyer].

   Creation and supporting users' profiles in the network space permit
   different personal information to be accessed by other users of the
   global network.  This could be made very undesirable problems for
   users and to disturb their privacy.  In this reason the Personal Data
   Protection (PDP) should be important obligation of the distributed
   services providers.  Some problems of digital privacy in the network
   world and challenges of cloud servicing for the personal data
   protection are discussed in [Romansky-1] and [Romansky-2].  A brief
   summary of the challenges of digital world for privacy and PDP is
   presented below.

7.2.  Digital World and Digital Privacy

   It is well-known that privacy is an important fundamental human right
   uniting personal data processing, personal communications via post
   and Internet, processing personal profiles in social media, forums
   and other distributed environments.  The new situation in the digital
   world changes the traditional understanding of the privacy as "the
   right to be alone" and introduces the new vision of "the right to be
   forgotten."  In this reason, giving different information resources
   and distributed information services by Internet requires creation of
   knowledge in the society for principles, methods and technological
   means and tool for adequate data processing.

   The digital world permits accessing and using components as web-
   sites, distributed resources, content, libraries, forums, social
   media, cloud services, etc.  Most people (individuals and employees)
   use Internet to extend their knowledge, social contacts and
   relationships.  Social network, forums and blogs permits to contact
   with different users.  Fact is that more employers visit social
   forums to select possible employees for their companies.  In this
   case the users are not only passive participants, but they could
   realize different forms of direct communications, uploading
   information and make access to published information of other users.

   Identical problems with data protection policy exist in the fields of
   network communications, distance learning, cloud services and other

Internet-Draft           PSTNizing the Internet                June 2015


   opportunities of the digital world.  This requires a serious risk
   analysis of activities by using web applications and network
   environments.  For example, the using of cloud services permits to
   increase the processing and storage power without additional
   investments for a company.  This form of remote data processing uses
   virtual machines and disks (storage) via Internet.  The problem is
   that the cloud collects more and more personal data of individuals
   and information about institutions.  All these activities in the
   digital world require developing an adequate information security
   policy and improving personal data protection legislation.

   Extended discussion about main principles and rules for data
   protection organization, securing privacy in the network world and
   summarized some important challenges of cloud servicing for the
   personal data protection are discussed in [Romansky-1] and
   [Romansky-2].

7.3.  Mine Principles of Personal Data Protection

   The Data Protection Policy must be regarded in the context of IT
   Security Policy as a part of Security Policy as shown in Figure-1.


     o--------------------o         o-----------------o
     | IT Security Policy | <------ | Security Policy |
     o--------+-----------o         o-----------------o
              |
              |
              |
     o--------v-----------o -->  Computer Layer
     |  Data Protection   |  -->  Physical Layer
     |     Policy         |   -->  Administrative Layer
     o--------------------o    -->  Legislative Layer

     Figure 1: Data Protection Policy in the Frame of Security Policy


   Security Policy should be regarded as set of means and methodologies
   for preventing incidents, detecting attacks and restoring the system
   after successful attack.  It includes rules, procedures and tools
   used on hierarchical layers (network, software, hardware, physical
   and administrative).  Data Protection Policy should be discussed in
   the frame of IT Security Policy and harmonization of data protection
   with information security rules from the security core (computer
   layer) to the external layers (administrative and legislative) is
   needed.  The computer layer presents embedded instruments for
   protection of personal data structures (hardware, software,
   cryptographic, biometric).  The physical layer consists of technical

   instruments, means and tools for unauthorized access blocking,
   separation of LAN segments, recognition of legitimate users, etc.
   The next two layers unite organizational rules, instructions and
   procedures for administrative control and legislative and normative
   documents.

   European understanding for "personal data" is the information that
   permits to identify a person directly or indirectly, in particular by
   reference to an identification number or to one or more factors
   specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural
   or social identity.  A popular definition in USA is connected to the
   rights and obligations of the individuals and institutions about
   collection, using, keeping and disclosing personal information.  In
   this reason any operation or set of operations with personal data
   (using automatic or not-automatic means) is called "processing of
   personal data."  The main participants in this process are "data
   subject" (the owner of personal data), "data controller" (determines
   the purpose and the means of processing and it is responsible for all
   procedures with personal data), "data processor" (real processing of
   personal data on the base of agreement with the data controller),
   "receiver of personal data" (the giving of personal data could be on
   the base of lawful reason only).

   Life cycle of personal data processing is proposed in Figure-2 and
   describes the traditional processing of personal data by a sequence
   of phases beginning from giving of personal data by individual and
   finishing with personal data destroying (by the data controller)
   after the goal realization.  The purpose of the phases is listed
   below.

   o  The COLLECTION of personal data must be made based on a legitimate
      reason only and with the consent of the individual;

   o  The PRESERVATION of collected data should be realized in the
      registers based on preliminary defined goal and criteria;

   o  The UTILIZATION must be made by legitimate persons on the base of
      principles of information security; authentication by using
      username, password, digital certificate, personal identification
      number, and biometric means; authorization on the base of
      developed digital right management system; accountability using
      personalization of the access to the data structures and
      registration of user activities;

   o  ACTUALIZATION, that is the personal data must be correct, full and
      actual; integrity and content management;

   o  The TRANSFER to other country and the giving to other person must
      be realized on the base of strong rules only;

   o  ARCHIVING could be made if it is required by law but for a limited
      period of time only;

   o  DELETION of personal data must be made after realization of the
      goal.

7.4.  Problems of Digital World for Privacy and Personal Data Protection

   The contemporary network world causes different problems for digital
   privacy.  For example the privacy in social media concerns with
   protection of users' information and securing the users' rights.  The
   media must try to prevent different incidents with users' data as
   unauthorized access, viruses, illegal transfer to third party, etc.
   Analogous problems could be detected and at cloud services also
   because the cloud customers need to be assured that providers
   implement adequate security policy for data protection.  Challenges
   of cloud for PDP discussed in [Romansky-2] are common for all network
   world.  Typical problem for cloud environments is multi-tenancy that
   could be risk category because it permits possible access to personal
   data of network user by another unauthorized user.  A short summary

Internet-Draft           PSTNizing the Internet                June 2015


   of common challenges for the privacy in the digital world is
   presented below.

   o  Clear IDENTIFICATION of the roles of the participants in PDP
      processes ("Data Controller," "Data Processor" and "Data
      Subject")and to determine the responsibility for data protection
      procedures (rules, measures, data subject rights, etc.).
      According to the definitions of Directive 95/46/EC the data
      controller determines purposes and means of the processing of
      personal data.  The problem in network world is that the functions
      of customer, vendor and provider and the relation between them
      could be defined for concrete case only.  The service providers
      have no legal obligation to protect personal data if they are not
      defined as controllers or processors.  This characterization will
      permit to ignore the data protection obligations at the cases of
      personal data outsourced or transferred to a third party for
      processing.

   o  Data subject's RIGHTS.  This is an integrated problem because the
      individuals have different rights during the personal data
      processing.  One of the main problems during the registration is
      that there is a risk for user's privacy (more personal data could
      be required for registration and identification).  For example,
      some social networking sites collect extended personal information
      in the page known as a "profile"(names, birth date, address, phone
      number, social life, gender, country, hobbies, relationships,
      etc.).  These pieces of data personalize the users in major level
      and the individuals must know the purpose of these data and reason
      for processing.  Another problem with the data subject's rights is
      the impossibility to revise, access, block or delete their
      personal data.  In other hand, the providers have a full access to
      the customer's data.  Data controller must guarantee that each
      user could define restriction for the own profile accessing.  This
      will prevent unauthorized access and incorrect dissemination of
      personal information.  This action could be realized by making the
      profile private from the user by selection of these who can visit
      the page and access to be after authentication.

   o  International data TRANSFER - according to Directive 95/46/EC
      personal data could be transferred to third countries if the level
      of personal data protection is adequate to those in the EU
      countries.  The data transfer between different service providers
      (social media) or data centers (clouds) located anywhere in the
      word is typical procedure.  Each personal information that is
      uploaded to cloud, social media, networking site, etc. must be
      protected according to the Directive 95/46/EC and users (data
      owners) must be informed for all transfers.

Internet-Draft           PSTNizing the Internet                June 2015


   o  Data DELETION.  If any user wants to delete data in his/her
      profile he/she must be sure that these data will be really
      deleted.  In some cases, data could be transferred to other
      service provider and a copy of data could be stored in different
      place(s).  This will be a problem of privacy for the individual.
      Another case is when the information that was deleted or removed
      by the user is passed to third party before deletion.  Data
      protection legislation gives strong rules for deletion of personal
      data in the traditional cases, but for the social media this is
      not clearly determined.

   o  SHARED information - all objects in the network society (sites,
      social media, clouds) could be accessible from different places of
      the world and the sharing of information will cause Internet-
      related security problems (loss of data, destroying the integrity,
      problems with accountability, hackers' attacks, etc.).  For
      example, each user of social media uploads information that will
      be shared between a set of users and it could be disseminated to
      different locations.  In this case the data subject does not know
      what policy and measures are used for counteraction to eventual
      attacks.  This problem is very important if data are sensitive
      (medical status, for example).

   o  TECHNICAL and ORGANIZATIONAL measures for data protection - an
      important obligation for the data controllers is to implement
      appropriate measures for information security.  These measures
      should be a counteraction to all forms of destruction or loss of
      personal data, to an unauthorized access (during the personal data
      processing or transmission via communication links), and to all
      illegal forms of processing.  The service providers should
      guarantee an effective protection of data integrity and data
      availability in cloud environment, but it is known that more data
      security measures will reduce the performance of the information
      processing.  In this reason, the providers must choose the most
      appropriate security measures.

7.5.  Last Regulations in Privacy and PDP

   Modernization of data protection rules on European level has been
   made in the last years.  An example is the document "Proposed
   Regulation" of the European Commission in January 2012 that proposes
   new rules to strengthen online data protection rights.  The reason
   for these draft amendments is the fact "that rapid technological
   development and globalization have profoundly changed the world and
   brought new challenges to the protection of personal data"
   [Knijpenga].  This document discuses the paradigm "right to be
   forgotten" as shown in Article 17, and the data subject rights to

   data portability as discussed in Article 18, transfer between
   different electronic processing systems.

   The European Parliament has determined on 12 March 2014 that
   architecture and fundamental principles of the data protection reform
   for improving user protection and security in Cyber-space [Fischer].
   The conclusion is that the further development and exploitation of
   Cyber-space could not be realized without an adequate and strong
   protection of the rights of individual users [EC].  The following
   FOUR pillars have been determined.

   o  Pillar-1: "One continents one law" - a requirement about the
      regulation and sanctions in private and public sectors.

   o  Pillar-2: "Strong regulation of European digital industry" - a
      requirement for the non-European companies, when offering services
      to European consumers, to apply the European rules and level of
      data protection.

   o  Pillar-3: "The right to be forgotten / The right to be erased" -
      this is the right of an individual to remove own personal data
      from the system if she/he no longer want to use the online
      services or there is no legitimate reason for keeping it in this
      online system.  This regulation will permit the individuals to
      control own online identify and to require the personal profile to
      be removed from the system (including social media platforms).

   o  Pillar-4: A "One-stop-shop" for businesses and citizens - a
      regulation for the personal data processing by controller or
      processor established in more that one country of European
      Union.The new principles of regulation must extend the PDP frame
      determined by the previously directives, and to propose adequate
      solutions for all problems of PDP in social environments.

   The new principles of regulation must extend the PDP frame determined
   by the previously directives, and to propose adequate solutions for
   all problems of PDP in the digital world.

   In other hand, the users should undertake personal measures to
   protect own information.  The best practice say "protect yourself" by
   using modern Internet security solutions (anti-virus programs,
   firewalls, tools for browser protection, reputation-checking tools,
   etc.).  These tools must be regularly updated.  An important side of
   the protection is using effective policy for authentication - the
   password should be a mix of letters and numbers, and change them
   often.  It is not correct to use the same password at the access to
   different network resources.  The visiting network resources must be
   deliberated and the reputation and safety rating of websites before

   using must be analyzed.  Finally, the main principle of users must be
   "guard your personal data."  Users must publish limited personal and
   financial information in the Internet, for example, social media,
   Internet cafes, websites, libraries, forums, etc.
