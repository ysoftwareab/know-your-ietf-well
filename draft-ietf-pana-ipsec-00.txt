Abstract  
     
   The PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access)  
   working group is developing protocol for authenticating clients to  
   the access network using IP based protocols.  The PANA protocol  
   authenticates the client and also establishes a PANA security  
   association between the PANA client and PANA authentication agent at  
   the end of a successful authentication. This document discusses the  
   details for establishing an IPsec security association using the PANA  
   security association for enabling IPsec based access control.

1.0 Introduction  
     
   The PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access)  
   working group is developing protocol for authenticating clients to  
   the access network using IP based protocols.  The PANA protocol  
   authenticates the client and also establishes a PANA security  
   association between the PANA client and PANA authentication agent at  
   the end of successful authentication. The PANA authentication agent  
   (PAA) indicates the results of the authentication using the PANA- 
   Bind-Request message wherein it can indicate the access control  
   method enforced by the access network. The PANA protocol [PANA-PROT]  
   does not discuss any details of IPsec [IPSEC] SA establishment, when  
   IPsec is used for access control. This document discusses the details  
   of establishing an IPsec security association between PANA client and  
   the enforcement point. When the IPsec SA is successfully established,  
   it can be used for access control and specifically used to prevent  
   the service theft mentioned in [PANA-THREATS].  
     
   Please refer to [PANAREQ] for terminology and definitions of terms  
   used in this document. The following picture illustrates what is  
   being protected with IPsec. In Figure 1, it is assumed that PAA and  
   EP are co-located. It is also possible that they are not co-located.  
   The IPsec security association protects the traffic between PaC and  
   EP. In IPsec terms, EP is a security gateway (therefore a router) and  
   forwards packets coming from the PaC to other nodes.

   First, this document discusses some of the pre-requisites for IPsec  
   SA establishment. Next, it gives details on what should be  
   communicated between PAA and EP. Then, it gives the details of  
   IKE/IPsec exchange with packet formats and SPD entries. Finally, it  
   discusses the issues when IPsec is used for remote access together  
   with local access.  
  
2.0 Keywords  
      
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",  
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this  
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].   
  
     
3.0 Pre-requisites for IPsec SA establisment  
  
   This document assumes that the following have already happened before  
   the IPSEC SA is established.  
     
     1) PANA client (PaC) learns the IP address of the Enforcement point  
        (EP) during the PANA exchange.  
     
     2) PaC learns that the network uses IPsec [IPSEC] for securing the  
        link between PaC and EP during the PANA exchange.  
     
     3) PaC has already acquired an IP address and EP knows about the IP  
        address of the PaC, before the IKE exchange starts. If IPv6 is  
        being used, the EP needs to know both the global address and the  
        link-local address of the PaC.  
  
4.0 IKE Pre-shared key derivation  
     
   If the network chooses IPsec to secure the link between PaC and EP,  
   PAA should communicate the IKE pre-shared key, the IP address of the  
   PaC and the PANA session ID to EP before the IKE exchange begins.  
   This might be just an API call, if PAA and EP are co-located. It is  
  
  
<Parthasarathy>           Expires March 2004                  [Page 3]  
  
               PANA enabling IPsec based Access Control   October 2003  
  
   assumed that the communication between PAA and EP is already secured  
   [PANA-REQ].   
     
   The IKE exchange between PaC and PAA is equivalent to the 4-way  
   handshake in [IEEE80211i] following the EAP exchange. The IKE  
   exchange establishes the IPsec SA similar to the pair-wise transient  
   keys (PTK) established in [IEEE80211i]. The IKE exchange provides  
   both key confirmation and protected cipher-suite negotiation.  
     
   IKE pre-shared key is derived as follows.  
     
   IKE Pre-shared Key = HMAC-SHA-1 (MSK, "IKE-preshared key" |  
                           Session ID)  
     
   The values have the following meaning:    
     
   MSK: The Master Session Key (MSK) is provided by the EAP method as  
   part of the PANA/EAP protocol execution. Please refer to [EAP-KEY]  
   for details.  
     
   Session ID: This value is a 128-bit value as defined in the PANA  
   protocol [PANA-PROT], which identifies a particular session of a  
   client.  
     
   The character "|" denotes concatenation as defined in [IKE].  
     
  
5.0 IKE and IPsec details  
     
   IKE [IKE] MUST be used for establishing the IPsec SA. Manual keying  
   may not be possible, as the network does not know all the PaCs that  
   will be authenticating to the network, a priori. Main mode with pre- 
   shared key SHOULD be supported. Aggressive mode with pre-shared key  
   MUST be supported. PaC and EP SHOULD use its IP address as the phase  
   I identifier in main mode and PANA session ID [PANA-PROT] as the  
   payload of ID_KEY_ID in aggressive mode for establishing the phase I  
   SA. An IP address would also work well as an identifier in aggressive  
   mode. But session ID was chosen to avoid potential problems with  
   link-local addresses in IPv6, which are guaranteed to be unique only  
   within the scope of a link.   
     
   After Phase I SA is established, quick mode exchange is performed to  
   establish an ESP tunnel mode IPsec SA for protecting the traffic  
   between PaC and EP. The next few sections discusses the packet  
   formats and SPD entries.  
  
6.0 Packet Formats  
  
   Following acronyms are used in this section.

   EP's address is denoted by EP-ADDR.  
   PaC's address is denoted by PAC-ADDR.  
   The node with which the PaC is communicating is denoted by END-ADDR.  
  
   Following is the packet format on the wire for packets sent from PaC  
   to EP:  
     
         IPv4/IPv6 header (source = PAC-ADDR,  
                           destination = EP-ADDR)  
         ESP header  
         IPv4/IPv6 header (source = PAC-ADDR,  
                           destination = END-ADDR)  
     
   In case of IPv6, the outer IP header's addresses SHOULD be the link- 
   local address of PaC and EP.  
     
   Following is the packet format on the wire for packets sent from EP  
   to PaC:  
     
     
         IPv4/IPv6 header (source = EP-ADDR,  
                           destination = PAC-ADDR)  
         ESP header  
         IPv4/IPv6 header (source = END-ADDR,  
                           destination = PAC-ADDR)  
     
   In case of IPv6, the outer IP header's addresses SHOULD be the link- 
   local address of PaC and EP.  
     
7.0 IPsec SPD entries  
     
   Following acronyms are used in this section.  
     
   EP's address is denoted by EP-ADDR.  
   PaC's address is denoted by PAC-ADDR.  
   PaC's link-local address is denoted by PAC-LINK-LOCAL  
   PaC's global address is denoted by PAC-GLOBAL-ADDR  
   EP's link-local address is denoted by EP-LINK-LOCAL  
     
   The SPD entries given below affect the traffic destined to EP-ADDR.  
   If PAA and EP share the same IP address, then the traffic destined to  
   PAA will also be affected. This implies that some of the control  
   traffic, which is already protected using PANA SA will be protected  
   with IPsec also. This can be avoided (if needed) by configuring  
   bypass IPsec policy for packets, which are not shown below.  
  
7.1 IPv4 SPD entries

   PaC's SPD OUT:  
             IF source = PAC-ADDR & destination = any  
              THEN USE ESP TUNNEL MODE SA:  
              outer source = PAC-ADDR  
              outer destination = EP-ADDR  
     
   PaC's SPD IN:  
            IF source = any & destination = PAC-ADDR  
             THEN USE ESP TUNNEL MODE SA:  
             outer source = EP-ADDR  
             outer destination = PAC-ADDR  
              
   EP's SPD OUT:  
            IF source = any & destination = PAC-ADDR  
             THEN USE ESP TUNEL MODE SA:  
             outer source = EP-ADDR  
             outer destination = PAC-ADDR  
     
   EP's SPD IN:  
            IF source = PAC-ADDR & destination = any  
             THEN USE ESP TUNNEL MODE SA:  
              outer source = PAC-ADDR  
              outer destination = EP-ADDR  
     
   During the IPsec SA setup, PaC uses PAC-ADDR as its phase 2 identity  
   (IDci) and EP uses ID_IPV4_ADDR_RANGE or ID_IPV4_ADDR_SUBNET as its  
   phase 2 identity. The starting address is zero IP address and the end  
   address is all ones for ID_IPV4_ADDR_RANGE. The starting address is  
   zero IP address and the end address is all zeroes for  
   ID_IPV4_ADDR_SUBNET.  
     
7.2 IPv6 SPD entries  
     
   The IPv6 SPD entries are slightly different from IPv4 to prevent the  
   neighbor/router discovery [IPV6-ND] packets from being protected with  
   IPsec. Due to the current limitation in specifying the proper  
   selectors for neighbor discovery packets, separate set of selectors  
   are added for bypassing IPsec for link-local traffic. All traffic  
   destined to global address is always sent to the default router i.e,  
   the global prefix is not considered to be on-link. In the future,  
   when the IPsec [IPSEC] allows selectors to be based on ICMPv6 types,  
   we just need an entry to bypass IPsec for neighbor/router discovery  
   packets and the rest of the entries will be similar to IPv4 SPD  
   entries.  
     
   Pac's SPD OUT:  
     
             IF source = ::/128  & destination = any

   Following the conceptual model in section 5.1 of [IPV6-ND], PaC would  
   maintain the following.  
     
   1) Neighbor Cache: This contains the entry for the link-local  
      address of EP.  
   2) Destination Cache: This contains the entry for all on-link and  
      off-link destinations.  
   3) Prefix List: This list contains the link-local prefix alone.  
   4) Default Router List: This list contains the EP alone.  
     
   Note that there are no entries for link-local addresses of other PaCs  
   as it is assumed that communications with other PaCs use global  
   addresses. All packets that are not destined to a link-local address  
   are sent to the default router (EP). This can be achieved by turning  
   off the "L" bit in the router advertisement.  
     
   During the IPsec SA setup, PaC uses PAC-GLOBAL-ADDR as its phase 2  
   identity (IDci) and EP uses ID_IPV6_ADDR_RANGE or ID_IPV6_ADDR_SUBNET  
   as its phase 2 identity. The starting address is zero IP address and  
   the end address is all ones for ID_IPV6_ADDR_RANGE. The starting  
   address is zero IP address and the end address is all zeroes for  
   ID_IPV6_ADDR_SUBNET.  
     
8.0 Double IPsec  
     
   If the PaC uses IPsec for secure remote access e.g., Corporate VPN  
   access, there will be separate SPD entries protecting the traffic  
   to/from remote network. In this case, IPsec may need to be applied  
   twice, once for protecting the remote access and once for protecting  
   the local access. This is the same as the iterative tunneling  
   discussed in [IPSEC].  
     
   When the IPsec SA is established with the remote security gateway,  
   the IKE packets from the PaC to the remote security gateway may or  
   may not need IPsec protection on the local link depending on the

   configuration at the EP. If EP requires IPsec protection for all  
   packets, then the PaC should configure SPD entries appropriately so  
   that IKE packets destined to EP are bypassed whereas IKE packets to  
   the remote SG are protected. If EP does not require IPsec protection  
   for IKE packets destined to remote security gateway, it needs to  
   configure SPD entries that would bypass them. This issue of  
   configuring SPD entries for IKE packets is being currently discussed  
   in the IPsec mailing list [IPSEC-ML].  
  
  
9.0 Security considerations  
     
   This document discusses the use of IPsec for access control when PANA  
   is used for authenticating the clients to the access network.  
     
   If the PAA does not verify whether PaC is authorized to use an IP  
   address, it is possible for the PaC to steal the traffic destined to  
   some other PaC. The use of IPsec does not prevent this attack. PAA  
   may use other mechanisms to prevent this attack.  
     
   When IPv6 is used, the SPD entries bypass all link-local traffic  
   without applying IPsec. This should not be a limitation as the link- 
   local address is used only by link-local services e.g.  
   neighbor/router discovery, which uses a different mechanism to  
   protect their traffic. Moreover, this limitation may not be there in  
   the future if IPsec extends the SPD selectors to specify ICMP types.
