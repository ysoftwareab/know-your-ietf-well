1. Introduction

   This memo describes an access service that is built upon the APEX [1]
   "relaying mesh".  The APEX access service is used to control use of
   both the relaying mesh and other APEX services.

   APEX, at its core, provides a best-effort datagram service.  Within
   an administrative domain, all relays must be able to handle messages
   for any endpoint within that domain.  APEX services are logically
   defined as endpoints but given their ubiquitous semantics they do not
   necessarily need to be associated with a single physical endpoint.
   As such, they may be provisioned co-resident with each relay within
   an administrative domain, even though they are logically provided on
   top of the relaying mesh, i.e.,

      +----------+     +----------+    +----------+    +---------+
      |   APEX   |     |   APEX   |    |   APEX   |    |         |
      |  access  |     | presence |    |  report  |    |   ...   |
      | service  |     |  service |    | service  |    |         |
      +----------+     +----------+    +----------+    +---------+
           |                |               |               |
           |                |               |               |
   +----------------------------------------------------------------+
   |                                                                |
   |                            APEX core                           |
   |                                                                |
   +----------------------------------------------------------------+

   That is, applications communicate with an APEX service by exchanging
   data with a "well-known endpoint" (WKE).

   APEX applications communicate with the access service by exchanging
   data with the well-known endpoint "apex=access" in the corresponding
   administrative domain, e.g., "apex=access@example.com" is the
   endpoint associated with the access service in the "example.com"
   administrative domain.

   Note that within a single administrative domain, the relaying mesh
   makes use of the APEX access service in order to determine if an
   originator is allowed to transmit data to a recipient (c.f., Step 5.3
   of Section 4.4.4.1 of [1]).

2. Management of Access Information

   Access information is organized around access entries, each of which
   contains:

   o  an owner: an APEX address with which the entry is associated;

   o  an actor: an APEX address that is granted permission to perform
      some action in the context of the owner;

   o  a list of actions; and,

   o  a timestamp indicating when the service last created or modified
      the access entry.

   The access entry for a given owner controls access to a potentially
   large range of different APEX services, such as data delivery, access
   control, and presence information.  In addition, Section 4.5 of [1]
   discusses APEX access policies that govern such activities as peer
   authentication, message relaying, and so on.

   Management of access information falls into three categories:

   o  applications may query the access service to see if one or more
      actions are allowed;

   o  applications may retrieve access information associated with an
      owner/actor combination; and,

   o  applications may modify (i.e., create, replace, or delete) access
      information associated with an owner/actor combination.

   Each is now described in turn.

2.1 Querying Access Information

   When an application wants to determine whether one or more actions
   are allowed for an owner/actor combination, it sends a "query"
   element to the service, e.g.,

       +-------+                  +-------+
       |       | -- data -------> |       |
       | appl. |                  | relay |
       |       | <--------- ok -- |       |
       +-------+                  +-------+

     C: <data content='#Content'>
            <originator identity='fred@example.com' />
            <recipient identity='apex=access@example.com' />
            <data-content Name='Content'>
                <query owner='fred@example.com' transID='1'
                       actor='barney@example.com'
                       actions='core:data presence:subscribe' />
            </data-content>
        </data>
     S: <ok />

Internet-Draft           The APEX Access Service             August 2001


   The service immediately responds with either an allow or deny
   operation containing the same transaction-identifier, e.g.,

                                    +-------+                  +-------+
                                    |       | <------- data -- |       |
                                    | relay |                  |access |
                                    |       | -- ok ---------> |  svc. |
                                    +-------+                  +-------+

       C: <data content='#Content'>
              <originator identity='apex=access@example.com' />
              <recipient identity='fred@example.com' />
              <data-content Name='Content'>
                  <allow transID='1' />
              </data-content>
          </data>
       S: <ok />

   or

       C: <data content='#Content'>
              <originator identity='apex=access@example.com' />
              <recipient  identity='fred@example.com' />
              <data-content Name='Content'>
                  <deny transID='1' />
              </data-content>
          </data>
       S: <ok />

2.2 Retrieval of Access Information

   When an application wants to retrieve the access entry associated
   with an owner/actor combination, it sends a "get" element to the
   service, e.g.,

       +-------+                  +-------+
       |       | -- data -------> |       |
       | appl. |                  | relay |
       |       | <--------- ok -- |       |
       +-------+                  +-------+

     C: <data content='#Content'>
            <originator identity='fred@example.com' />
            <recipient identity='apex=access@example.com' />
            <data-content Name='Content'>
                <get transID='2'
                     owner='fred@example.com'
                     actor='*@example.com' />
            </data-content>
        </data>
     S: <ok />

   The service immediately responds with a set operation containing the
   access entry and the same transaction-identifier, e.g.,

                                  +-------+                  +-------+
                                  |       | <------- data -- |       |
                                  | relay |                  |access |
                                  |       | -- ok ---------> |  svc. |
                                  +-------+                  +-------+

     C: <data content='#Content'>
            <originator identity='apex=access@example.com' />
            <recipient identity='fred@example.com' />
            <data-content Name='Content'>
                <set transID='2'>
                    <access owner='fred@example.com'
                            actor='*@example.com'
                            actions='core:data presence:subscribe'
                            lastUpdate='2000-05-14T13:02:00-08:00' />
                </set>
            </data-content>
        </data>
     S: <ok />

2.3 Update of Access Information

   When an application wants to create or modify an access entry
   associated with an owner/actor combination, it sends a "set" element
   to the service containing the new access entry, e.g.,

       +-------+                  +-------+
       |       | -- data -------> |       |
       | appl. |                  | relay |
       |       | <--------- ok -- |       |
       +-------+                  +-------+

     C: <data content='#Content'>
            <originator identity='wilma@example.com' />
            <recipient identity='apex=access@example.com' />
            <data-content Name='Content'>
                <set transID='1'>
                    <access owner='fred@example.com'
                            actor='*@example.com'
                            actions='core:data presence:subscribe'
                            lastUpdate='2000-05-14T13:02:00-08:00' />
                </set>
            </data-content>
        </data>
     S: <ok />

   Note that Step 4 of Section 4.4 requires that the "lastUpdate"
   attribute of an access entry be supplied in order to update that
   entry; accordingly, applications must successfully retrieve an access
   entry prior to trying to modify that entry.

   The service immediately responds with a reply operation containing
   the same transaction-identifier, e.g.,

                                  +-------+                  +-------+
                                  |       | <------- data -- |       |
                                  | relay |                  |access |
                                  |       | -- ok ---------> |  svc. |
                                  +-------+                  +-------+

     C: <data content='#Content'>
            <originator identity='apex=access@example.com' />
            <recipient identity='wilma@example.com' />
            <data-content Name='Content'>
                <reply code='250' transID='1' />
            </data-content>
        </data>
     S: <ok />

   Note that Steps 6.2 and 9.2 of Section 4.4 require that the access
   service update the "lastUpdate" attribute of an access entry when it
   is created or modified.

   The service also immediately sends a set operation to the address
   associated with the access entry, e.g.,

                                  +-------+                  +-------+
                                  |       | <------- data -- |       |
                                  | relay |                  |access |
                                  |       | -- ok ---------> |  svc. |
                                  +-------+                  +-------+

     C: <data content='#Content'>
            <originator identity='apex=access@example.com' />
            <recipient identity='fred@example.com' />
            <data-content Name='Content'>
                <set transID='1'>
                    <access owner='fred@example.com'
                            actor='*@example.com'
                            actions='core:data presence:subscribe'
                            lastUpdate='2000-05-14T23:02:00-08:00' />
                </set>
            </data-content>

   When an application wants to delete the access entry associated with
   an owner/actor combination, it sends a "set" element to the service
   omitting the permitted actions, e.g.,

       +-------+                  +-------+

   The service also immediately sends a set operation to the address
   associated with the access entry, e.g.,

                                  +-------+                  +-------+

     C: <data content='#Content'>
            <originator identity='apex=access@example.com' />
            <recipient identity='fred@example.com' />
            <data-content Name='Content'>

                    <access owner='fred@example.com'
                            actor='*@example.com'
                            lastUpdate='2000-05-14T13:02:00-08:00' />
                </set>
            </data-content>
        </data>
     S: <ok />

   Because there are no actions associated with this access entry, the
   owner knows that the entry has been deleted.

3. Format of Access Entries

   Each administrative domain is responsible for maintaining one or more
   "access entries" for each of its endpoints and associated
   subaddresses (regardless of whether those addresses are currently
   attached to the relaying mesh).

   A separate access entry is required for each actor or group of actors
   for whom access permission is specified.  Section 6 defines the
   syntax for access entries.  Each access entry has an "owner"
   attribute, an "actor" attribute, an "actions" attribute, a
   "lastUpdate" attribute, and no content:

   o  the "owner" attribute specifies the address (endpoint or
      subaddress) associated with the access entry;

   o  the "actor" attribute specifies an entity or group of entities for
      whom access permissions are specified, as described below;

   o  the "actions" attribute specifies the permissions granted to the
      actor in the context of the owner; and,

   o  the "lastUpdate" attribute specifies the date and time that the
      service last created or modified the access entry.

   An action is specified as a service/operation pair, e.g., the action
   "presence:publish" refers to the "publish" operation of the
   "presence" service.  Two values are reserved:

   o  "all" is used to refer to all services and/or operations, e.g.,
      "all:data", "presence:all"; and,

   o  "core" is used to refer to the service implemented by the relaying
      mesh, e.g., the "core:data" permission is consulted by the
      relaying mesh (c.f., Step 5.3 of Section 4.4.4.1 of [1]).

   An actor is an APEX address and is specified using the "entity"
   syntax specified in Section 2.2 of [1].  However, both the "local"
   and "domain" parts may contain limited wildcarding:

   o  The "local" part is either:

      *  a literal string (e.g., "fred"); or,

      *  the value "apex=*", specifying all APEX services; or,

      *  the value "*", specifying any address other than an APEX
         service.

   o  The "domain" part is either:

      *  a FQDN (e.g., "example.com"); or,

      *  the value "*", specifying all administrative domains.

   The following default entries are provided for each owner, but are
   overridden by an explicitly supplied entry with the same actor value:

       actor='local@domain'  actions='all:all'
       actor='apex=*@domain' actions='all:all'
       actor='apex=*@*'      actions='core:data'
       actor='*@*'           actions=''

   where "local@domain" specifies the owner associated with the access
   entry.

   For example, the explicit entry

       actor='*@*'           actions='core:data'

   allows endpoints from any domain to use the relaying mesh to send
   data to the owner, but does not override the default entry for
   "apex=*@domain", which allows all APEX services in the owner's domain
   access to all actions.

3.1 Finding the Appropriate Entry: Matching Owners and Actors

   The use of actor wildcarding makes it possible for several access
   entries to apply for a given owner/actor combination.  When
   determining which access entry to use, the following selection
   priorities, from highest to lowest, are applied in this order:

   1.  An exact match (e.g., "fred@example.com")

   2.  Any service in the specified domain (e.g., "apex=*@example.com")

   3.  Any local-part in the specified domain (e.g., "*@example.com")

   4.  The specified local-part in any domain (e.g., "fred@*" or
       "apex=presence@*")

   5.  Any service in any domain (i.e., "apex=*@*")

   6.  Any local-part in any domain (i.e., "*@*")

   For example, consider these access entries:

       <access owner='fred@example.com'
               actor='wilma@example.com'
               actions='all:all'
               lastUpdate='2000-05-14T13:20:00-08:00' />
       <access owner='fred@example.com'
               actor='mr.slate@example.com'
               actions='core:data'
               lastUpdate='2000-05-14T13:20:00-08:00' />
       <access owner='fred/appl=wb@example.com'
               actor='barney/appl=wb@example.com'
               actions='core:data'
               lastUpdate='2000-05-14T13:20:00-08:00' />
       <access owner='fred@example.com'
               actor='*@example.com'
               actions='core:data presence:subscribe presence:watch'
               lastUpdate='2000-05-14T13:20:00-08:00' />
       <access owner='fred@example.com'
               actor='*@*'
               actions='core:data'
               lastUpdate='2000-05-14T13:20:00-08:00' />

   Briefly:

   o  For addresses within the "example.com" administrative domain:

      *  "fred", "wilma", and all APEX services within the "example.com"
         administrative domain are allowed access to all operations for
         "fred@example.com";

      *  "mr.slate" is allowed access only to send data through the
         relaying mesh to "fred@example.com";

      *  "barney/appl=wb" is allowed access only to send data to
         "fred/appl=wb", a subaddress of "fred@example.com"; and,

      *  any other address within the "example.com" administrative
         domain is allowed access to send data and invoke the
         "subscribe" and "watch" operations of the APEX presence service
         with respect to "fred@example.com".

   o  For any address outside the "example.com" administrative domain,
      the address is allowed access to send data, regardless of whether
      it is an APEX service.

   Note that although the four default entries are always available, the
   explicit entry for actor "*@*" overrides the corresponding default
   entry.

4. The Access Service

   Section 5 contains the APEX service registration for the access
   service:

   o  Within an administrative domain, the service is addressed using
      the well-known endpoint of "apex=access".

   o  Section 6 defines the syntax of the operations exchanged with the
      service.

   o  A consumer of the service initiates communications by sending data
      containing a query, get, or set operation.

   o  The service replies to these operations.

   o  When an access entry is changed, the service sends a notification
      to the owner associated with the changed entry.

   An implementation of the service must maintain information about
   access entries in persistent storage.

   Consult Section 6.1.1 of [1] for a discussion on the properties of
   long-lived transaction-identifiers.

4.1 Use of XML and MIME

   Section 4.1 of [1] describes how arbitrary MIME content is exchanged
   as a BEEP [2] payload.  For example, to transmit:

       <data content='...'>
           <originator identity='fred@example.com' />
           <recipient identity='apex=access@example.com' />
       </data>

    where "..." refers to:

       <query owner='fred@example.com' transID='1'
              actor='barney@example.com'
              actions='core:data presence:subscribe' />

    then the corresponding BEEP message might look like this:

       C: MSG 1 2 . 42 1234
       C: Content-Type: multipart/related; boundary="boundary";
       C:               start="<1@example.com>";

4.2 The Query Operation

   When an application wants to see if a particular operation is
   allowed, it sends a "query" element to the service.

   The "query" element has an "owner" attribute, an "actor" attribute,
   an "actions" attribute, a "transID" attribute, and no content:

   o  the "owner" attribute specifies the address associated with the
      access entry;

   o  the "actor" attribute specifies the address (without wildcarding)
      for which access permissions are queried;

   o  the "actions" attribute specifies one or more actions for which
      permission is queried; and,

   o  the "transID" attribute specifies the transaction-identifier
      associated with this operation.

   When the service receives a "query" element, we refer to the "owner"
   attribute as the "subject".  The service performs these steps:

   1.  If the subject is outside this administrative domain, a "reply"
       element having code 553 is sent to the originator.

   2.  If the subject does not refer to a valid address, a "reply"
       element having code 550 is sent to the originator.

   3.  If the subject's access entry matching the originator does not
       contain an "access:query" token, a "reply" element having code
       537 is sent to the originator.

   4.  The subject's access entry matching the actor attribute of the
       query element is selected.

   5.  If all of the permissions in the "actions" attribute of the query
       element are contained in the selected access entry, then an
       "allow" element is sent to the originator.

   6.  Otherwise, a "deny" element is sent to the originator.

   Regardless of whether an "allow", "deny", or "reply" element is sent
   to the originator, the "transID" attribute is identical to the value
   found in the "query" element sent by the originator.

4.3 The Get Operation

   When an application wants to retrieve the access entry associated
   with an owner/actor combination, it sends a "get" element to the
   service.

   The "get" element has an "owner" attribute, an "actor" attribute, a
   "transID" attribute, and no content:

   o  the "owner" attribute specifies the address associated with the
      access entry;

   o  the "actor" attribute specifies the address (with possible
      wildcarding) for which access permissions are retrieved; and,

   o  the "transID" attribute specifies the transaction-identifier
      associated with this operation.

   When the service receives a "get" element, we refer to the "owner"
   attribute as the "subject".  The service performs these steps:

   1.  If the subject is outside this administrative domain, a "reply"
       element having code 553 is sent to the originator.

   2.  If the subject does not refer to a valid address, a "reply"
       element having code 550 is sent to the originator.

   3.  If the subject's access entry matching the originator does not
       contain an "access:get" token, a "reply" element having code 537
       is sent to the originator.

   4.  The subject's access entry whose "actor" attribute identically
       matches the "actor" attribute of the "get" element is selected.

   5.  If no such entry exists, a "reply" element having code 550 is
       sent to the originator.

   6.  Otherwise, a "set" element corresponding to the selected access
       entry is sent to the originator.

   Regardless of whether a "set" or "reply" element is sent to the
   originator, the "transID" attribute is identical to the value found
   in the "get" element sent by the originator.

4.4 The Set Operation

   When an application wants to modify (i.e., create, replace, or
   delete) the access entry associated with an owner/actor combination,
   it sends a "set" element to the service.

   The "set" element has a "transID" attribute, and contains an "access"
   element:

   o  the "transID" attribute specifies the transaction-identifier
      associated with this operation; and,

   o  the "access" element contains the access entry to be created,
      replaced, or deleted.

   The "access" element has an "owner" attribute, an "actor" attribute,
   an optional "actions" attribute, an optional "lastUpdate" attribute,
   and no content:

   o  the "owner" attribute specifies the address associated with the
      access entry;

   o  the "actor" attribute specifies the address (with possible
      wildcarding) for which access permissions are specified;

   o  the "actions" attribute (present only to add or replace an entry)
      specifies one or more actions for which permission is to be
      determined; and,

   o  the "lastUpdate" attribute (present only to replace an entry)
      specifies the current timestamp of the access entry that is to be
      replaced.

   When the service receives a "set" element, we refer to the "owner"
   attribute of the access element as the "subject".  The service
   performs these steps:

   1.  If the subject is outside this administrative domain, a "reply"
       element having code 553 is sent to the originator.

   2.  If the subject does not refer to a valid address, a "reply"
       element having code 550 is sent to the originator.

   3.  If the subject's access entry matching the originator does not
       contain an "access:set" token, a "reply" element having code 537
       is sent to the originator.

   4.  The subject's access entry whose "actor" attribute identically
       matches the "actor" attribute of the "set" element is selected.

   5.  If no such entry exists and the "lastUpdate" attribute is present
       in the supplied "set" element, a "reply" element having code 555
       is sent to the originator.

   6.  If no such entry exists, then:

       1.  The access entry for the owner/actor combination is created
           from the supplied "access" element.

       2.  The "lastUpdate" attribute of that access entry set to the
           service's notion of the current date and time.

       3.  A "reply" element having code 250 is sent to the originator.

       4.  A "set" element corresponding to the newly-created access
           entry is sent to the subject's address.

   7.  If the selected entry's "lastUpdate" attribute is not identical
       to the "lastUpdate" attribute of the supplied "access" element, a
       "reply" element having code 555 is sent to the originator.

   8.  If "actions" attribute of the supplied "access" element is empty,
       then:

       1.  The selected entry is deleted.

       2.  A "reply" element having code 250 is sent to the originator.

       3.  A "set" element corresponding to the owner/actor combination,
           but containing an empty "actions" attribute is sent to the
           subject's address.

   9.  Otherwise:

       1.  The access entry for the owner/actor combination is updated
           from the supplied "access" element.

       2.  The "lastUpdate" attribute of the updated access entry is set
           to the service's notion of the current date and time (which
           should be different from the "lastUpdate" value associated
           with any replaced entry).

       3.  A "reply" element having code 250 is sent to the originator.

       4.  A "set" element corresponding to the newly-updated access
           entry is sent to the subject's address.

   When sending the "reply" element, the "transID" attribute is
   identical to the value found in the "set" element sent by the

7. Security Considerations

   Consult [1]'s Section 11 for a discussion of security issues.

   In addition, timestamps issued by the the access service may disclose
   location information.  If this information is considered sensistive,
   the special timezone value "-00:00" may be used.

Appendix B. Revision History

   Note to RFC editor: please remove this entire appendix, and the
   corresponding entries in the table of contents, prior to publication.

B.1 Changes from draft-ietf-apex-access-06

   o  Corrected four typos, used some better grammar in one spot.

   o  Removed the reference to "xml.resource.org" in the DTD.

   o  Added timezone warning to the "Security Considerations" section.


B.2 Changes from draft-ietf-apex-access-05

   o  The new date-time format referenced in the core document is now
      used for the timestamp data-type.

   o  The relationship of the "reply" element to the core document was
      clarified.


B.3 Changes from draft-ietf-apex-access-04

   o  Re-organization previous version for consistency.


B.4 Changes from draft-ietf-apex-access-03

   o  Change access service to use an owner/actor combination as the
      fundamental unit of access information.

   o  Separate access query function from access information management
      functions.

   o  Remove redundant "owner" attribute from "set" element.

   o  Merge "access" and "entry" elements into just "access".  Multiple
      "access" elements are now needed for a single subject.

   o  Change framework for applying defaults: default entries are
      applied in the absence of any overriding access entry.

   o  Add some introductory text about the relationship between access
      permision owners and APEX operations.

B.5 Changes from draft-ietf-apex-access-02

   o  A small number of typos were corrected.


B.6 Changes from draft-ietf-apex-access-01

   o  It is made more clear that each subaddress has its own access
      entry.

   o  A successful set operation results in the new access entry being
      sent to the endpoint associated with the entry.

   o  A small number of typos were corrected.


B.7 Changes from draft-ietf-apex-access-00

   o  Change "addr-spec" syntax from RFC 822 to APEX's custom ABNF.
