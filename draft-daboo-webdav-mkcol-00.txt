1.  Introduction

   WebDAV [RFC4918] defines an HTTP [RFC2616] method MKCOL.  This method
   is used to create WebDAV collections on the server.  However, several
   WebDAV-based specifications (e.g., DeltaV [RFC3253], CalDAV
   [RFC4791]) define "special" collections or resources - ones which are
   identified by additional values in the DAV:resourcetype property
   assigned to the collection resource, or through other means.  These
   "special" collections are created by new methods (e.g., MKACTIVITY,
   MKWORKSPACE, MKCALENDAR).  The addition of a new MKxxx method for
   each new "special" collection or resource adds to server complexity
   and is detrimental to overall reliability due to the need to make
   sure intermediaries are aware of these methods.

   This specification proposes an extension to the WebDAV MKCOL method
   that adds a request body allowing a client to specify WebDAV
   properties to be set on the newly created collection or resource.  In
   particular, the DAV:resourcetype property can be used to create a
   "special" collection, or other properties used to create a "special"
   resource.  This avoids the need to invent new MKxxx methods.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   When XML element types in the namespace "DAV:" are referenced in this
   document outside of the context of an XML fragment, the string "DAV:"
   will be prefixed to the element type names.

3.  WebDAV extended MKCOL

   The WebDAV MKCOL request is extended to allow the inclusion of a
   request body.  The request body is an XML document containing a
   single DAV:mkcol XML element at the top-level.  One or more DAV:set
   XML elements MAY be included in the DAV:mkcol XML element to allow
   setting properties on the collection as it is created.  In
   particular, to create a collection of a particular type, the DAV:
   resourcetype XML element MUST be included in a DAV:set XML element
   and MUST specify the correct resource type elements for the new
   resource.

   As per the PROPPATCH method, servers MUST process any DAV:set
   instructions in document order (an exception to the normal rule that
   ordering is irrelevant).  Instructions MUST either all be executed or
   none executed.  Thus, if any error occurs during processing, all
   executed instructions MUST be undone and a proper error result

   returned.  Failure to set a property value on the collection MUST
   result in a failure of the overall MKCOL request.

   Additional XML elements, specific to the type of resource being
   created, MAY be included in the DAV:mkcol XML element.  For example,
   the DAV:mkactivity XML element can be included to provide the same
   behavior that it would have done if used in an MKACTIVITY request.

   If a server attempts to make any of the property changes in an
   extended MKCOL request (i.e., the request is not rejected for high-
   level errors before processing the body), the response MUST be an XML
   document containing a single DAV:mkcol-response XML element, which
   MUST contain DAV:propstat XML elements with the status of each
   property.

   Additional XML elements, specific to the type of resource being
   created, MAY be included in the DAV:mkcol-response XML element.  For
   example, the DAV:mkactivity-response XML element can be included to
   provide the same behavior that it would have done if used in an
   MKACTIVITY response.

   In all other respects the behavior of the extended MKCOL request
   follows that of the standard MKCOL request.

3.1.  Extended MKCOL Support

   A server supporting the features described in this document, MUST
   include "extended-mkcol" as a field in the DAV response header from
   an OPTIONS request on any resource that supports use of the extended
   MKCOL method.

3.1.1.  Example: Using OPTIONS for the Discovery of Support for extended
        MKCOL

   >> Request <<

   OPTIONS /addressbooks/users/ HTTP/1.1
   Host: addressbook.example.com

   >> Response <<

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Allow: OPTIONS, GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, TRACE, COPY, MOVE
   Allow: MKCOL, PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, LOCK, UNLOCK, REPORT, ACL
   DAV: 1, 2, 3, access-control, extended-mkcol

3.2.  Status Codes

   As per Section 9.3.1 of [RFC4918].

3.3.  Example: Successful extended MKCOL Request

   This example shows how the extended MKCOL request is used to create a
   collection of a fictitious type "special-resource".

   >> Request <<

   MKCOL /home/special/ HTTP/1.1
   Host: special.example.com
   Content-Type: application/xml; charset="utf-8"
   Content-Length: xxxx

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
   <D:mkcol xmlns:D="DAV:"
                 xmlns:E="http://example.com/ns/">
     <D:set>
       <D:prop>
         <D:resourcetype>
           <D:collection/>
           <E:special-resource/>
         </D:resourcetype>
         <D:displayname>Special Resource</D:displayname>
       </D:prop>
     </D:set>
   </D:mkcol>

       <D:status>HTTP/1.1 200 OK</D:status>
     </D:propstat>
   </D:mkcol-response>

4.  Replacing existing MKxxx methods

   One of the goals of this extension is to eliminate the need for other
   extensions to define their own variant of MKCOL to create the special
   collections they need.  This extension can be used to replace
   existing MKxxx methods in other extensions as detailed below.  If a
   server supports this extension and the other extension listed, then
   the server MUST support use of the extended MKCOL method to achieve
   the same result as the MKxxx method of the other extension.

4.1.  MKCALENDAR replacement

   CalDAV [RFC4791] defines the MKCALENDAR method to create a calendar
   collection as well as set properties during creation.

   The extended MKCOL method can be used instead by specifying both DAV:
   collection and CALDAV:calendar-collection XML elements in the DAV:
   resourcetype property, set during the extended MKCOL request.

4.1.1.  Example: Replacing MKCALENDAR with MKCOL

   The first example below shows an MKCALENDAR request containing a
   CALDAV:mkcalendar XML element in the request body, and returning a
   CALDAV:mkcalendar-response XML element in the response body.  The
   second example shows the equivalent extended MKCOL request with the
   same request and response XML elements.

4.2.  MKWORKSPACE replacement

   Versioning Extensions to WebDAV [RFC3253] defines the MKWORKSPACE
   method to create a collection that is used as a versioning workspace.

   The extended MKCOL method can be used instead by specifying the DAV:
   collection XML element in the DAV:resourcetype property, and

   specifying the DAV:workspace property (set to the URI of the
   workspace resource itself) during the extended MKCOL request.

   In addition, any DAV:mkworkspace XML element that would have been
   sent in the MKWORKSPACE request can also be included in the DAV:mkcol
   XML element.

   Also, the DAV:mkcol-response XML element in the response to the
   extended MKCOL request can also include the DAV:mkworkspace-response
   element, if that would have been sent in the response to the
   equivalent MKWORKSPACE request.

4.2.1.  Example: Replacing MKWORKSPACE with MKCOL

   The first example below shows an MKWORKSPACE request containing a
   DAV:mkworkspace XML element in the request body, and returning a DAV:
   mkworkspace-response XML element in the response body.  The second
   example shows the equivalent extended MKCOL request with the same
   request and response XML elements.

4.3.  MKACTIVITY replacement

   Versioning Extensions to WebDAV [RFC3253] defines the MKACTIVITY
   method to create a resource to represent a versioning activity.

   The extended MKCOL method can be used instead by specifying the DAV:
   activity XML element in the DAV:resourcetype property set during the
   extended MKCOL request.

   In addition, any DAV:mkactivity XML element that would have been sent
   in the MKACTIVITY request can also be included in the DAV:mkcol XML
   element.

   Also, the DAV:mkcol-response XML element in the response to the
   extended MKCOL request can also include the DAV:mkactivity-response
   element, if that would have been sent in the response to the
   equivalent MKACTIVITY request.

4.3.1.  Example: Replacing MKACTIVITY with MKCOL

   The first example below shows an MKACTIVITY request containing a DAV:
   mkactivity XML element in the request body, and returning a DAV:
   mkactivity-response XML element in the response body.  The second
   example shows the equivalent extended MKCOL request with the same
   request and response XML elements.
