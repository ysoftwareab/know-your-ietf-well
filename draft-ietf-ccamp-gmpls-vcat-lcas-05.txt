1. Introduction 

   The Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) suite of 
   protocols allows for the automated control of different switching 
   technologies including Synchronous Optical Network (SONET), 
   Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH), Optical Transport Network (OTN) 
   and Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy (PDH). This document describes 
   extensions to RSVP-TE to support the Virtual Concatenation (VCAT) 
   layer 1 inverse multiplexing mechanism that has been standardized for 
   SONET, SDH, OTN and PDH technologies along with its companion Link 
   Capacity Adjustment Scheme (LCAS).   

   VCAT is a TDM oriented byte striping inverse multiplexing method that 
   works with a wide range of existing and emerging TDM framed signals, 
   including very high bit rate OTN and SDH/SONET signals. Other than 
   member signal skew compensation this layer 1 inverse multiplexing 
   mechanism adds minimal additional signal delay. VCAT enables the 
   selection of an optimal signal bandwidth (size), extraction of 
   bandwidth from a mesh network, and, when combined with LCAS, hitless 
   dynamic resizing of bandwidth and fast graceful degradation in the 
   presence of network faults. To take full advantage of VCAT/LCAS 
   functionality extensions to GMPLS signaling are given that enable the 
   setup of diversely routed circuits that are members of the same VCAT 
   group.

3. VCAT/LCAS Scenarios and Specific Requirements 

   There are a number of specific requirements for the support of 
   VCAT/LCAS in GMPLS that can be derived from the carriers' 
   application-specific demands for the use of VCAT/LCAS and from the 
   flexible nature of VCAT/LCAS.  These are set out in the following 
   section. 

    

3.1. VCAT/LCAS Interface Capabilities  

   In general, an LSR can be ingress/egress of one or more VCAT groups.  
   VCAT and LCAS are interface capabilities.  An LSR may have, for 
   example, VCAT-capable interfaces that are not LCAS-capable.  It may 
   at the same time have interfaces that are neither VCAT nor LCAS-
   capable. 

3.2. Member Signal Configuration Scenarios 

   We list in this section the different scenarios.  Here we use the 
   term "VCG" to refer to the entire VCAT group and the terminology 
   "set" and "subset" to refer to the collection of potential VCAT group 
   member signals. 

   Fixed, co-routed: A fixed bandwidth VCG, transported over a co-routed 
      set of member signals.  This is the case where the intended 
      bandwidth of the VCG does not change and all member signals follow 
      the same route to minimize differential delay.  The intent here is 
      the capability to allocate an amount of bandwidth close to that 
      required at the client layer. 

   Fixed, diversely routed: A fixed bandwidth VCG, transported over at 
      least two diversely routed subsets of member signals.  In this 
      case, the subsets are link-disjoint over at least one link of the 
      route.  The intent here is more efficient use of network 
      resources, e.g., no unique route has the required bandwidth.

Internet-Draft    Operating VCAT and LCAS with GMPLS          June 2008 
    

   Fixed, member sharing: A fixed bandwidth VCG, transported over a set 
      of member signals that are allocated from a common pool of 
      available member signals without requiring member connection 
      teardown and setup.        

   Dynamic, co-routed: A dynamic VCG (bandwidth can be increased or 
      decreased via the addition or removal of member signals), 
      transported over a co-routed set of members.  The intent here is 
      dynamic resizing and resilience of bandwidth. 

   Dynamic, diversely routed: A dynamic VCG (bandwidth can be increased 
      or decreased via the addition or removal of member signals), 
      transported over at least two diversely routed subsets of member 
      signals.  The intent here is efficient use of network resources, 
      dynamic resizing and resilience of bandwidth. 

   Dynamic, member sharing: A dynamic bandwidth VCG, transported over a 
      set of member signals that are allocated from a common pool of 
      available member signals without requiring member connection 
      teardown and setup.   

3.3. VCAT Operation With or Without LCAS 

   VCAT capabilities may be present with or without the presence of 
   LCAS.  The use of LCAS is beneficial to the provision of services, 
   but in the absence of LCAS, VCAT is still a valid technique.  
   Therefore GMPLS mechanisms for the operation of VCAT are REQUIRED for 
   both the case where LCAS is available and the case where it is not 
   available.  The GMPLS procedures for the two cases SHOULD be 
   identical. 

   GMPLS signaling for LCAS-capable interfaces MUST support all 
      scenarios of section 3.2. with no loss of traffic. 

   GMPLS signaling for non-LCAS-capable interfaces MUST support only the 
      "fixed" scenarios of section 3.2.  

   To provide for these requirements GMPLS signaling MUST carry the 
   following information on behalf of the VCAT endpoints: 

   The type of the member signal that the VCG will contain, e.g., VC-3, 
      VC-4, etc.

   The total number of members to be in the VCG. This provides the 
      endpoints in both the LCAS and non-LCAS case with information on 
      which to accept or reject the request, and in the non-LCAS case 
      will let the receiving endpoint know when all members of the VCG 
      have been established. 

   Identification of the VCG and its associated members. This provides 
      information that allows the endpoints to differentiate multiple 
      VCGs and to tell what members (LSPs) to associate with a 
      particular VCG. 

3.4. VCGs and VCG Members 

   VCG members (server layer connections) may be set up prior to their 
      use in a VCG.  

   VCG members (server layer connections) may exist after their 
      corresponding VCG has been removed.  

   The signaling solution SHOULD provide a mechanism to support the 
   previous scenarios. However, it is not required that arbitrarily 
   created server layer connections be supported in the above scenarios. 

4. GMPLS Mechanisms in Support of VCGs 

   We describe in this section the signaling mechanisms that already 
   exist in GMPLS using RSVP-TE [RFC3473] and [RFC4328], and the 
   extensions needed to completely support the requirements of section 
   3. 

   When utilizing GMPLS with VCAT/LCAS we utilize a number of control 
   and data plane concepts that we describe below. 

  VCG member -- This is an individual data plane signal of one of the 
     permitted SDH, SONET, OTN or PDH signal types. 

  Co-signaled member set -- One or more VCG members (or potential 
     members) set up via the same control plane signaling exchange. Note 
     that all members in a co-signaled set follow the same route. 

  Co-routed member set - One or more VCG members that follow the same 
     route. Although VCG members may follow the same path, this does not 
     imply that they were co-signaled. 

  Data plane LSP -- for our purposes here, this is equivalent to an 
     individual VCG member.

Internet-Draft    Operating VCAT and LCAS with GMPLS          June 2008 
    

  Control plane LSP -- A control plane entity that can control multiple 
     data plane LSPs. For our purposes here this is equivalent to our 
     co-signaled member set.  
      

   Section 4.1 is included for informational purposes only.  It 
   describes existing GMPLS procedures that support a single VCG 
   composed of a single co-signaled member set. 

   Section 4.2 describes new procedures to support VCGs composed of more 
   than one co-signaled member sets. This includes the important 
   application of a VCG composed of diversely routed members.  Where 
   possible it reuses applicable existing procedures from section 4.1.  

4.1. VCGs Composed of a Single Co-Signaled Member Set 

   Note that this section is for informational purposes only. 

   The existing GMPLS signaling protocols support a VCG composed of a 
   single co-signaled member set. Setup using the NVC field is explained 
   in section 2.1 of [RFC4606].  In this case, one (single) control 
   plane LSP is used in support of the VCG. 

   There are two options for setting up the VCG, depending on hardware 
   capability, or management preferences: one-shot setup and incremental 
   setup. 

   The following sections explain the procedure based on an example of 
   setting up a VC-4-7v SDH VCAT group (corresponding to an STS-3c-7v 
   SONET VCAT group). 

4.1.1. One-shot VCG Setup with Co-Signaled Members 

   An RSVP-TE Path message is used with the following parameters. 

   With regards to the traffic parameters, the elementary signal is 
   chosen (6 for VC-4/STS-3c_SPE).  The value of NVC is then set to 7. 

   A Multiplier Transform greater than 1 (say N>1) is used if the 
   operator wants to set up N VCAT groups that will belong to, and be 
   assigned to, one LSP. 

   SDH or SONET labels in turn have to be assigned for each member of 
   the VCG and concatenated to form a single Generalized Label 
   constructed as an ordered list of 32-bit timeslot identifiers of the 
   same format as TDM labels.  [RFC4606] requires that the order of the 

 
 
Bernstein              Expires December 8, 2008                [Page 8] 

Internet-Draft    Operating VCAT and LCAS with GMPLS          June 2008 
    

   labels reflect the order of the payloads to concatenate, and not the 
   physical order of time-slots. 

4.1.2. Incremental VCG Setup with Co-Signaled Members 

   In some cases, it may be necessary or desirable to set up the VCG 
   members individually, or to add group members to an existing group. 

   One example of this need is when the hardware that supports VCAT can 
   only add VCAT elements one at a time or cannot automatically match 
   the elements at the ingress and egress for the purposes of inverse 
   multiplexing.  Serial or incremental setup solves this problem. 

   In order to accomplish incremental setup an iterative process is used 
   to add group members.  For each iteration, NVC is incremented up to 
   the final value required.  The iteration consists of the successful 
   completion of Path and Resv signaling.  At first, NVC = 1 and the 
   label includes just one timeslot identifier  

   At each of the next iterations, NVC is set to (NVC +1), one more 
   timeslot identifier is added to the ordered list in the Generalized 
   Label (in the Path or Resv message).  A node that receives a Path 
   message that contains changed fields will process the full Path 
   message and, based on the new value of NVC, it will add a component 
   signal to the VCAT group, and switch the new timeslot based on the 
   new label information. 

   Following the addition of the new label to the LSP, LCAS may be used 
   in-band to add the new label into the existing VCAT group.  LCAS 
   signaling for this function is described in [ITU-T-G.7042]. 

4.1.3. Procedure for VCG Reduction by Removing a Member 

   The procedure to remove a component signal is similar to that used to 
   add components as described in Section 4.1.2.  The LCAS in-band 
   signaling step is taken first to take the component out of service 
   from the group.  LCAS signaling is described in [ITU-T-G.7042].  
    
   In this case, the NVC value is decremented by 1 and the timeslot  
   identifier for the dropped component is removed from the ordered  
   list in the Generalized Label.  
    
   Note that for interfaces that are not LCAS-capable, removing one  
   component of the VCG will result in errors in the inverse-
   multiplexing procedure of VCAT and result in the teardown of the 
   whole group.  So, this is a feature that only LCAS-capable VCAT 
   interfaces can support without management intervention at the end 
 
 
Bernstein              Expires December 8, 2008                [Page 9] 

Internet-Draft    Operating VCAT and LCAS with GMPLS          June 2008 
    

   points.  
    
   Note also that a VCG member can be temporary removed from the VCG due 
   to a failure of the component signal. The LCAS in-band signaling will 
   take appropriate actions to adjust the VCG as described in [ITU-T-
   G.7042]. 

4.1.4. Removing Multiple VCG Members in One Shot 

   The procedure is similar to 4.1.3.  In this case, the NVC value is 
   changed to the new value and all relevant timeslot identifiers for 
   the components to be torn down are removed from the ordered list in 
   the Generalized Label.  This procedure is also not supported for 
   VCAT-only interfaces without management intervention as removing one 
   or more components of the VCG will tear down the whole group. 

4.1.5. Teardown of Whole VCG 

   The entire LSP is deleted in a single step (i.e., all components are 
   removed in one go) using deletion procedures of [RFC3473]. 

4.2. VCGs Composed of Multiple Co-Signaled Member Sets 

   The motivation for VCGs composed of multiple co-signaled member sets 
   comes from the requirement to support VCGs with diversely routed 
   members. The initial GMPLS specification did not support diversely 
   routed signals using the NVC construct.  In fact, [RFC4606] says: 

         [...] The standard definition for virtual concatenation allows 
         each virtual concatenation components to travel over diverse 
         paths.  Within GMPLS, virtual concatenation components must 
         travel over the same (component) link if they are part of the 
         same LSP.  This is due to the way that labels are bound to a 
         (component) link.  Note however, that the routing of components 
         on different paths is indeed equivalent to establishing 
         different LSPs, each one having its own route.  Several LSPs 
         can be initiated and terminated between the same nodes and 
         their corresponding components can then be associated together 
         (i.e., virtually concatenated). 

   The setup of diversely routed VCG members requires multiple co-
   signaled VCG member sets, i.e., multiple control plane LSPs. 

   To support a VCG with multiple co-signaled VCG members sets requires 
   being able to identify separate control plane LSPs with a single VCG 
   and exchange information pertaining to the VCG as a whole. This is 
   very similar to the "Call" concept described in [RFC4974]. We can

Internet-Draft    Operating VCAT and LCAS with GMPLS          June 2008 
    

   think of our VCAT/LCAS connection, e.g., our VCG, as a higher layer 
   service that makes use of multiple lower layer (server) connections 
   that are controlled by one or more control plane LSPs.  

4.2.1. Signaled VCG Layer Information 

   When a VCG is composed of multiple co-signaled member sets, none of 
   the control plane LSP's signaling information can contain information 
   pertinent to the entire VCG. In this section we give a list of 
   information that should be communicated at what we define as the VCG 
   Call layer, i.e., between the VCG signaling endpoints.  To 
   accommodate this information additional objects or TLVs are 
   incorporated into the Notify message as it is described for use in 
   call signaling in [RFC4974]. 

   VCG Call setup information signaled via the Notify message with the 
   Call management bit (C-bit) set: 

     1. Signal Type 

     2. Number of VCG Members 

     3. LCAS requirements: 

          a. LCAS required  

          b. LCAS desired  

          c. LCAS not desired (but acceptable)  

     4. VCG Identifier - Used to identify a particular VCG separately 
        from the call ID so that call members can be reused with 
        different VCGs per the requirements for member sharing and the 
        requirements of section 3.4.  

4.3. Call Data Object 

   In RFC4974 the general mechanism for communicating call information 
   via Notify messages is given. In general different types of calls 
   will need to convey call related information during call 
   establishment and updates. We define a general CALL_DATA object for 
   inclusion in call related notify messages and define a specific class 
   type (C-Type) for VCAT calls.

4.4. VCAT TLV Object 

   For use in the CALL_DATA object (of VCAT-Call C-Type) in Notify 
   messages we define the following VCAT TLV: 

       0                   1                   2                   3 
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      | Signal Type                   |      Number of Members        | 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      | LCAS Req      |  Action       |            VCG ID             | 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    

   Signal Type can take the following values and MUST never change over 
   the lifetime of a VCG: 

      Value  Type (Elementary Signal) 
      -----  ------------------------ 
        1     VT1.5  SPE / VC-11 
        2     VT2    SPE / VC-12 
        3     STS-1  SPE / VC-3 
        4     STS-3c SPE / VC-4 
       11     OPU1 (i.e., 2.5 Gbit/s 
       12     OPU2 (i.e., 10  Gbit/s) 
       13     OPU3 (i.e., 40  Gbit/s) 
       21     T1   (i.e., 1.544 Mbps) 
       22     E1   (i.e., 2.048 Mbps) 
       23     E3   (i.e., 34.368 Mbps) 
       24     T3   (i.e., 44.736 Mbps) 
    

   Number of Members is a non-negative integer that indicates the total 
   number of members in the VCG (not just the call)and MUST be changed 
   over the life of the VCG to indicate the current number of members. 

    

   LCAS Required can take the following values and MUST NOT change over 
   the life of a VCG:

   Action is used to indicate the relationship between the call and the 
   VCG and takes the following values. 

      Value                Meaning 
      -----    --------------------------------- 
      0        No VCG ID (set up call prior to VCG creation) 
      1        New VCG for Call  
      2        No Change in VCG ID (number of members may have changed)  
      3        Remove VCG from Call  
    

   VCG ID: A 16 bit non-negative integer used to identify a particular 
   VCG within a session. This number MUST NOT change over the lifetime 
   of a VCG but can change over the lifetime of a call. To support the 
   member sharing scenario of section 3.2. and the requirements of 
   section 3.4. we allow the VCG Identifier within a call to be changed. 
   In this way the connections associated with a call can be dedicated 
   to a new VCG (allowing for a priori connection establishment and 
   connection persistence after a VCG has been removed).  

    

4.5. Procedures for Multiple Co-signaled Member Sets 

   To establish a VCG a CALL_DATA object containing a VCAT TLV is 
   exchanged as part of call establishment or update. A VCG can be 
   established at the same time as a new call or associated with an 
   existing call that currently has no VCG association. When modifying 
   the bandwidth of a VCG a CALL_DATA object containing a VCAT TLV MUST 
   precede any of those changes and indicate the new total number of VCG 
   members. 

   The following mechanisms can be used to increase the bandwidth of a 
   VCG. 

   LSPs are added to a VCAT Call associated with a VCG (Action = 2).  

   A VCG is associated with an existing VCAT call containing LSPs 
      (Action = 1).

Internet-Draft    Operating VCAT and LCAS with GMPLS          June 2008 
    

   The following internal ordering is used when increasing the bandwidth 
   of a VCG in a hitless fashion when LCAS is supported: 

   A CALL_DATA Object containing a VCAT TLV indicating the new number of 
      members after the proposed increase is sent. If an error is 
      returned from the receiver the VCG state remains the same prior to 
      the attempted increase. 

   Either: (a) New LSPs are set up within a call associated with the 
      VCG, or (b) LSPs in an existing call are now associated with the 
      VCG. 

   The internal LCAS entity is instructed by the endpoints to "activate" 
      the new VCG member(s). 

   The following mechanisms can be used to decrease the bandwidth of a 
   VCG. 

   LSPs are removed from a VCAT Call associated with a VCG (Action = 2). 

   A VCG association is removed from existing VCAT call containing LSPs 
      (Action = 3). 

   In general the following internal ordering is used when decreasing 
   the bandwidth of a VCG in a hitless fashion when LCAS is supported: 

   1. A CALL_DATA Object containing a VCAT TLV indicating the new number 
      of members after the proposed decrease is sent. If an error is 
      returned from the receiver the VCG state remains the same prior to 
      the attempted decrease. 

   2. The LCAS entity is instructed by the endpoints to "deactivate" the 
      members to be removed from the VCG. 

   3. Either: (a) An LSP is removed from a call associated with a VCG; 
      or (b) All the LSPs of a call are removed from the VCG when the 
      association between the VCG and VCAT call is removed. 

   Note that when LCAS is not used or unavailable the VCG will be in an 
   unknown state between the time the VCG call level information is 
   updated and the actual data plane LSPs are added or removed. Note 
   that the incremental setup procedure of section 4.1.2. can be applied 
   to any of the above procedures.

4.5.1. Setting up a VCAT call and VCG 

   Arguably the most common operation will be simultaneously setting up 
   a VCAT call and its associated VCG at the same time. To do this when 
   one sets up a new VCAT call in the VCAT TLV one sets Action = 1 
   indicating that this is a new VCG for this call.  LSPs would then be 
   added to the call until the number of members reaches the number 
   specified in the VCAT TLV.  

   Note that any other bandwidth modifications to the VCG whether up or 
   down will require a new VCAT call message with an appropriately 
   modified TLV reflecting the new number of members. 

4.5.2. Setting up a VCAT call + LSPs with no VCG 

   To provide for pre-establishment of the server layer connections for 
   a VCG one can establish a VCAT call without an associated VCG. In 
   addition, to provide for member sharing a pool of calls with 
   connections can be established, then one or more of these calls (with 
   accompanying connections) can be associated with a particular VCG 
   (via the VCG ID). Note that multiple calls can be associated with a 
   single VCG but that no call contains members used in more than one 
   VCG. 

   To establish a VCAT call with no VCG association when one sets up a 
   new VCAT call in the VCAT TLV one sets Action = 0 indicating that 
   this is a VCAT call without an associated VCG.  LSPs can then be 
   added to the call. The number of members parameter in the VCAT TLV 
   has no meaning at this point since it reflects the intended number of 
   members in a VCG and not in a call.  A call will know via the 
   containment hierarchy about its associated data plane LSPs. However, 
   the signal type does matter since signal types can never be mixed in 
   a VCG and hence a VCAT call should only contain one signal type. 

    

4.5.3. Associating an existing VCAT call with a VCG 

   Given a VCAT call without an associated VCG such as that set up in 
   section 4.5.2. one associates it with a VCG as follows. In the VCAT 
   call a new notify message is sent with a CALL_DATA object with a VCAT 
   TLV with Action = 1, a VCG ID, and the correct number of VCG members 
   specified based on adding all of the calls data plane LSPs to the VCG 
   as members. 

   Note that the total number of VCGs supported by a piece of equipment 
   may be limited and hence on reception of any message with a change of

Internet-Draft    Operating VCAT and LCAS with GMPLS          June 2008 
    

   VCG ID this limit should be checked. Likewise the sender of a message 
   with a change in VCG ID should be prepared to receive an error 
   response. To take a particular VCG out of service, rather than just 
   removing all its member, a special flag element is included. 

    

4.5.4. Removing the association between a call and VCG 

   To reuse the server layer connections in a call in another VCG one 
   first needs to remove the current association between the call and a 
   VCG.  To do this, in the VCAT call a new notify message is sent with 
   a CALL_DATA object with a VCAT TLV with Action = 3, a VCG ID, and the 
   correct number of VCG members specified based on removing all of the 
   calls data plane LSPs from the VCG as members. When the association 
   between a VCG and all existing calls has been removed then the VCG is 
   considered torn down. 

5. Error Conditions and Codes 

   VCAT Call and member LSP setup can be denied for various reasons. 
   Below is a list of error conditions that can be encountered during 
   these procedures.  These fall under RSVP error code TBD. 

   These can occur when setting up a VCAT call or associating a VCG with 
   a VCAT call. 

   Error                                  Subcode 
   ------------------------------------   -------- 
   VCG signal type not Supported             1 
   LCAS option not supported                 2 
   Max number of VCGs exceeded               3 
   Max number of VCG members exceeded        4 
   LSP Type incompatible with VCAT call      5 
    

6. IANA Considerations 

   This document requests from IANA the assignment of a new RSVP-TE 
   Object for CALL_DATA and a C-Type within that class for a VCAT call. 
   Within this VCAT C-Type are a set of code points for permissible 
   signal types. In addition, we request a new RSVP error code for use 
   with VCAT call and define a number of corresponding error sub-codes.

7. Security Considerations 

   This document introduces a specific use of the Notify message and 
   admin status object for GMPLS signaling as originally specified in 
   [RFC4974].  It does not introduce any new signaling messages, nor 
   change the relationship between LSRs that are adjacent in the control 
   plane.  The call information associated with diversely routed control 
   plane LSPs, in the event of an interception may indicate that there 
   are members of the same VCAT group that take a different route and 
   may indicate to an interceptor that the VCG call desires increased 
   reliability. 

   Otherwise, this document does not introduce any additional security 
   considerations.
