1. Introduction

   Ad hoc networks are infrastructure-less, multi-hop routing, wireless
   mobile networks formed spontaneously. Multi-hop routing, random
   movement of the nodes and other features unique to ad hoc networks
   results in lots of control signal overhead for route discovery and
   maintenance. This is highly unacceptable in bandwidth-constrained ad
   hoc networks. Usually these devices have limited computing resources
   and severe energy constraints. Due to these characteristics, there is
   lot of research work happening in the performance optimization of ad
   hoc networks. However, most of the research works are based on
   optimization at individual layer. [10] indicates that optimizing a
   particular layer might improve the performance of that layer locally
   but might produce non-intuitive side effects that will degrade the
   overall system performance.

   This draft briefly summarizes the interlayer interaction metrics,
   points to the information to be exchanged and the benefits of such 
   information exchange between lower layer, routing layer and transport layer. 
   This is useful to design and standardize an adaptive architecture that 
   can exploit the interdependencies among link, medium access, network and
   application protocols. The architecture where each layer of the
   protocol stack responds to the local variations as well as to the
   information from other layers is a major challenge.

2. Implications of interlayer interactions

   Currently ad hoc routing protocols are researched to work mainly on
   the network layer. It guarantees the independency of the network
   layer. However each layer need to do redundant processing and
   unnecessary packet exchange to get information that is easily
   available to other layers. This increases control signals resulting
   in wastage of bandwidth, packet collision, etc. By using interlayer
   interaction, different layers can share locally available
   information. This will result in substantial amount of performance
   improvement.

   Any method is scalable with respect to a (parameter, metric,
   environment) triple [14]. The interlayer interactions are nothing but
   the interactions among various environmental parameters. These
   interactions may affect the fairness of the scalability comparison 
   between different methods. Thus it is important to standardize these
   parameters as well as interactions among them. Ad hoc network
   protocol architecture can give optimized performance by exploiting
   the environmental parameters information flow across different
   layers.

3. Interaction metrics

   Interlayer interactions schemes that can support adaptability and
   optimization of the routing protocols are needed. We need to treat
   the entire stack as a single algorithmic construct in order to
   improve the performance. Such optimized routing protocol can discover
   and maintain the routes based on current link status, traffic
   congestion, signal strength etc. There is need for a general 
   framework to improve performance in scalable ad hoc network.

3.1 Interactions between Lower layer and routing layer


3.1.1 Signal strength

   Usually routing layer is not concerned with signal strength related
   information handling. Lower layer takes care of signal strength
   related issues. Signal strength can be useful to know a nodes
   neighbor, the link to select for best effort packet forwarding etc.
   Only the link with signal strength above the threshold value can
   forward the packet.Routing algorithm can exploit signal characteristics
   related information for such benefits.

3.1.2 Interface identifiers

   To reduce overhead and bandwidth consumption due to large packet
   size, lower layer identifier is useful e.g. in source routing based
   protocols such as DSR, flow state extension is determined to reduce
   the packet size. If a node uses flow state extension, previous and
   next nodes interface identifier is recorded in the flow table.

3.1.3 Link failure detection time

   MAC layer has to go through multiple transmissions before concluding
   about the link failure resulting in time gap between the occurrence
   of link failure and its determination. This detection time increases
   with increasing load in the network. Periodic beacons at the routing
   layer can be used to reduce this time gap.

3.1.4 Interference

   There is some delay involved between the time when RTS packet is sent
   and when data packet is received. This delay is high due to the
   contention of the channel in the region where there is lot of
   interference from other nodes. Thus interference awareness at the
   network layer discourages new routes from using such links.

3.1.5 Congestion

   Delay arising due to queuing of the packet at the MAC layer is a
   measure of congestion in a node. Congestion aware routing algorithm 
   avoids nodes with large number of queued packets in its buffer.

3.1.6 Bandwidth

   A link with high bandwidth can naturally carry more traffic. Thus
   bandwidth aware routing algorithm assigns more route to higher
   bandwidth link. This helps in uniform link utilizations.

3.1.7 SNR information

   Transmission rate can be adjusted based on the number of errors in
   the received packets. At the physical layer, channel
   estimation is performed to obtain the instantaneous SNR of a link. A
   transmitter then chooses a transmission rate based on the estimated
   SNR value. This in turn affects the packet delay of the link. At the
   network layer, routing decisions are made based on the packet delay
   associated with each link. The routing decisions in turn affect the
   offered load distribution in the network and impact the packet delay,
   transmission rate, and SNR on individual link.

3.1.8 Link type information

   Some routing protocols (such as AODV) assume that all links between 
   originating node and destination node are symmetric links. So, during 
   route discovery, an additional notification method should be added to 
   efficiently discover the path between source and destination.

3.2 Interactions between lower layer and transport layer

Internet-Draft           Interlayer interaction           September 2003


3.2.1 TCP window size

   If TCP sends more packets, probability of false link failures
   increases. As a result of this, link failures lead to dropping of
   packets, route failures, unnecessary slow start initiation at TCP
   sender, possible timeout at TCP sender, and finally decreased overall
   throughput. Limiting Max. TCP window size results in a
   reduction of false link failures and throughput improvements.

3.2.2 Link capacity

   Transport layer protocol such as TCP has its own flow control adapted
   to network status. Ad hoc networks consist of wireless links
   with bandwidth constraints. If there is an indication for link
   overflow at link layer, transport layer can control the sending rate
   before network congestion in advance.

3.2.3 The number of retransmissions at MAC layer

   Increasing the number of retransmission results in i) increasing the
   probability of successful frame transfer, ii) reducing the
   probability of false link failures, iii) increases a link failure
   detection time. However, that gives rise to a side effect such as an
   increasing end-to-end delay and degrading network performance due to
   TCP RTO timeout. To solve these problems, the notification/feedback
   from link layer to transport layer is needed to prevent the
   initiation of congestion control at transport layer.

3.2.4 Link status notification

   In Ad hoc networks, performance degradation happens mainly due to
   node mobility. When lower layer detects link failure, a feedback/
   notification is needed to prevent packet losses during route
   re-discovery. If any notification/feedback is not provided, upstream
   node of failed link must cache on-flight packet. This may cause
   buffer overflow and waste network resources.

4. Security Considerations

   This document does not specifically address any security concerns.
   This document does assume that all layers in the node communicate
   with other layers without any security considerations. But the
   security concern involved in it must be considered appropriately.

5. Future works

   This document briefly summarizes the interaction metrics. More detail
   information is needed about these metrics. Also the exact information
   flow between lower layer and routing layer is needed. How the routing
   layer or lower layer should use information received from lower layer 
   or routing layer and its effect on performance optimization remain a
   challenge to achieve.
