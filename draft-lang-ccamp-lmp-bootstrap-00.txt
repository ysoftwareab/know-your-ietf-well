2. Abstract 
    
   The Link Management Protocol (LMP) requires that at least one bi-
   directional control channel is established between the nodes. The 
   control channel may be transmitted either in-band with the data 
   links or out-of-band over a separate wavelength, fiber, or IP 
   network. This draft specifies a simple procedure to dynamically 
   bootstrap control channels and exchange interface mappings using a 
   new LMP message that is transmitted in-band over the data links.

   This work fits squarely in the CCAMP box. 
    
3.3 Why is it Targeted at this WG 
    
   This draft is targeted at the CCAMP WG because this draft specifies 
   an extension to the Link Management Protocol (LMP). 
    
3.4 Justification 
    
   The WG should consider this document as it specifies the extensions 
   to the link management protocol in support auto-discovery of control 
   channel endpoint addresses for out-of-band signaling. This falls in 
   the category of multiple physical path and tunnel technologies.

4. Introduction 
    
   The Link Management Protocol (LMP) [LMP] is run between a pair of 
   nodes and is used to manage traffic engineering (TE) links. This 
   includes discovering the local/remote interface mappings and 
   exchanging the TE link properties. LMP requires that a bi-
   directional control channel is established between the nodes. This 
   control channel may be in-band with the data links or out-of-band, 
   possibly over a separate wavelength, fiber, or IP network. 
    
   Control channel bootstrapping is the procedure of automatically 
   discovering the neighboring node and the IP address(es) of the 
   neighborÆs control channel endpoints. Once these are learned, normal 
   LMP procedures (i.e., Config message exchange) can be used to bring 
   up one or more LMP control channels. Note that these procedures can 
   be initiated by either node if both nodes know the addresses of the 
   control channel endpoints. 
    
   Automatic discovery of the local/remote interface mappings can be 
   done by sending in-band messages that contain the local interface 
   identifiers. For example, this functionality is provided in LMP 
   using the Test procedure. To support interfaces with multiple 
   termination capabilities (i.e., encoding type, transport mechanism, 
   bandwidth, wavelength, etc.), a negotiation phase is used to agree 
   upon the parameters of the Test procedure. This is done in LMP by 
   first establishing a control channel, and then discovering the data 
   port connectivity according to the negotiated parameters. 
    
   When the control channel is in-band, the existing LMP Config message 
   exchange can be used to bootstrap the control channel as well as 
   exchange the local interface mappings. 
    
   Currently there is no LMP mechanism to bootstrap out-of-band control 
   channels and discover the interface mappings before establishing a 
   control channel. In this draft, we provide a simple mechanism to do 
   both (i.e., dynamically bootstrap out-of-band control channels as 
   well as exchange the local port Ids). 
    
5. LMP Bootstrap message 
    
   In this section, we define a new LMP bootstrap message (Msg Type = 
   TBA by IANA). This message is transmitted in-band over a data link 
   and identifies the Node Id of the sender, the Interface ID of the 
   data link, and one or more IP addresses of the control channel 
   endpoints. The format of the Bootstrap message is as follows: 
    
   <Bootstrap Message> ::= <Common Header> <LOCAL_INTERFACE_ID> 
   <LOCAL_NODE_ID> <LOCAL_CONTROL_ADDRESS> [<LOCAL_CONTROL_ADDRESS>...] 
    
   Multiple LOCAL_CONTROL_ADDRESS objects may be included in a single 
   Bootstrap message. In this case each Control Address MUST be unique. 
   If a Bootstrap Message is received with multiple LOCAL_CONTROL

Internet Draft  draft-lang-ccamp-lmp-bootstrap-00.txt       June 2002 

   ADDRESS objects with the same Control Address, only one control 
   channel SHOULD be established; the duplicate objects SHOULD be 
   ignored. 
    
   The LMP Common Header, LOCAL_INTERFACE_ID object, and LOCAL_NODE_ID 
   object are defined in [LMP]. The LOCAL_CONTROL_ADDRESS object is 
   defined in Section 5.2. 
    
   This message SHOULD be sent to the Multicast address (224.0.0.1). 
    
5.1 Procedures 
    
   The process of bootstrapping the control channel(s) requires 
   periodic transmission of the LMP Bootstrap message over the data 
   link(s) until (1) A Config message is received for each (distinct) 
   address specified in the LOCAL_CONTROL_ADDRESS object or (2) a 
   timeout expires and no Config message has been received for all of 
   the addresses specified in the LOCAL_CONTROL_ADDRESS objects of the 
   Bootstrap message. The default value for the retransmission interval 
   is 500ms. The default value for the timeout is 5 minutes. 
    
   When the Bootstrap message is received, the received Interface Id is 
   recorded and mapped to the local Interface Id for that data link. 
   The received Node Id is recorded to identify the neighbor associated 
   with the data link. The Control Address(es) SHOULD be used for 
   establishing the out-of-band LMP control channel(s). If a Control
   Address is numbered, then the LMP Config message should be sent to 
   that address. If a Control Address is unnumbered, then the LMP 
   Config message should be sent to the Node Id. 
    
   It is possible that Bootstrap messages are received over several 
   data links. If the Control Addresses are the same, or if they 
   correspond to a control channel that is already established or in 
   the process of being established, then they should be ignored. The 
   received Interface Ids should still be recorded and mapped to the 
   local Interface Id.

5.3 LMP Bootstrap transport 
    
   In this section, we define the transport mechanism for the LMP 
   Bootstrap message when the data link encoding is SONET/SDH. Based on 
   the termination capabilities of the nodes and the links connecting 
   the nodes, the following different transport mechanisms are defined: 
    
        J0-16: 16 byte J0 LMP Bootstrap message 
         
           The Bootstrap message is transmitted using J0 overhead bytes 
           with string length of 16 bytes (with CRC-7).  See table 4 of 
           ITU G.707 [G707] for the 16-byte J0 definition.  The 
           definition of CRC-7 is found in Annex B of ITU G.707. 
            
           Note that due to the byte limitation, the Bootstrap message 
           is NOT sent as an IP packet and as such, no L2 encapsulation 
           is used. In addition, only IPv4 or unnumbered interfaces may 
           be used for the Interface Id or Control Address. 
           Furthermore, only one Control Address can be included. A 
           special Bootstrap message format is defined as follows: 
            
           The Bootstrap message is a 15-byte message, where the 7 most 
           significant bits (MSb) of each byte are usable.  Due to the 
           byte limitation, the LMP Header is not included. 
            
           The first usable bit is used to identify the type of 
           Interface Id: if set, the Interface Id is numbered (IPv4); 
           if clear, the Interface Id is unnumbered. The next usable 32 
           bits MUST be the Interface Id. The next usable 32 bits MUST

Internet Draft  draft-lang-ccamp-lmp-bootstrap-00.txt       June 2002 

           be the Node Id. The next usable bit is used to identify the 
           type of Control Address: if set, the Interface Id is 
           numbered (IPv4); if clear, the Control Address is 
           unnumbered. The next usable 32 bits MUST be the Control 
           Address. The remaining bits are Reserved. 
            
        J0-64: 64 byte J0 Bootstrap Message 
                  
           The Bootstrap message is transmitted using J0 overhead bytes 
           with string length of 64 bytes (see GR-253-CORE [GR253]).  
           Note that this is only appropriate for SONET encoding and 
           not SDH encoding. 
            
           The Bootstrap message is sent as an IP packet as defined 
           above. 
            
           Byte limitations may restrict the address combinations 
           and/or the number of Control Addresses that are included. 
            
        DCCS: Bootstrap Message over the Section DCC 
         
           The Bootstrap message is transmitted using the DCC Section 
           Overhead bytes with bit-oriented HDLC framing format. 
            
           The Bootstrap message is sent as an IP packet as defined 
           above. 
                 
        DCCL: Bootstrap Message over the Line DCC  
         
           The Bootstrap message is transmitted using the DCC Line 
           Overhead bytes with bit-oriented HDLC framing format. 
            
           The Bootstrap message is sent as an IP packet as defined 
           above. 
    
6. Discussion 
    
   The LMP bootstrap procedure is based on the assumption that the data 
   link encoding type, transport mechanism, transmission rate, and 
   transmission wavelength are either (a) known, (b) agreed upon in 
   advance, or (c) able to be dynamically detected at the time the 
   procedure is run. Furthermore, the addresses of the control channel 
   enpoints are assumed to be reachable via normal IP routing. If the 
   control channel is provided through a VPN, either IP-based VPN 
   (e.g., [RFC2547], IP tunneling (GRE or IP in IP), etc.), or a sub-IP 
   based VPN (e.g., MPLS, FR, ATM, etc.), further configuration may be 
   needed. 
    
7. Security Considerations 
    
   Security considerations are for future study.
