          1. Introduction 

            This memo was produced by the DHCP Working Group and defines a 
            portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with 
            network management protocols in the Internet community.  In 
            particular, it describes a set of extensions that DHCP and Bootstrap 
            Protocol (BOOTP) servers implement.  Many implementations support 
            both DHCP and BOOTP within a single server and hence this memo 
            describes the MIB for both DHCP and BOOTP servers. 

            This memo does not cover DHCP/BOOTP client nor relay agent MIB 
            extensions: these are possibly the subjects of future investigation. 

            This memo is based on the Internet-standard Network Management 
            Framework as defined by documents [RFC1902, RFC1903, RFC1904]. 

            Objects defined in this MIB allow access to and control of DHCP 
            Server Software.  Servers MAY also provide additional management 
            capabilities through the use of the Applications MIB [RFC2287]. 

            The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
            "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
            this document are to be interpreted as described in document 
            [RFC2119]. 


          2. Overview 

            In the tradition of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) 
            the minimum number of objects possible are defined in this MIB, 
            while still providing as rich a set of management information as 
            possible.  An object is left out of this MIB when it can be derived 
            from other objects that are provided.  Further to the tradition of 
            the SNMP, computationally intense operations are left to the domain 
            of the management station.  Thus, this MIB provides a set of objects 
            from which other management information may be derived.

          Internet Draft              DHCP Server MIB               November 2000 

            The examples provided in the following sections are not meant to be 
            comprehensive, they are merely illustrative of the potential uses of 
            the objects defined by this MIB. 

          2.1. BOOTP and DHCP Counter Groups 

            This section describes some of the management information that may 
            be derived from the objects provided in the counter groups. 

            The total number of valid DHCP packets received by the server is 
            computed as the sum of the dhcpCountDiscovers, dhcpCountRequests, 
            dhcpCountReleases, dhcpCountDeclines, and dhcpCountInforms objects.  
            The total number of valid packets (BOOTP and DHCP) received is 
            computed as the total number of valid DHCP packets plus the value of 
            the bootpCountRequests object.  The total number of packets received 
            is computed as the total number of valid packets plus 
            bootpCountInvalids and dhcpCountInvalids. 

            Similar to the received computations, the total number of DHCP 
            packets sent by the server is computed as the sum of the 
            dhcpCountOffers, dhcpCountAcks, and dhcpCountNacks objects.  The 
            number of packets (BOOTP and DHCP) sent by the server is computed as 
            the total number of DHCP packets sent plus the value of the 
            bootpCountReplies object. 

          2.2. BOOTP and DHCP Statistics Group 

            This section describes some of the management information that may 
            be derived from the objects provided in the statistics group. 

            Given time 1 (t1) and time 2 (t2) greater than t1, the mean inter-
            arrival time of valid DHCP messages for the interval t1 to t2 can be 
            computed as (dhcpStatLastArrivalTime at t2 minus 
            dhcpStatLastArrivalTime at t1) divided by (valid DHCP received 
            packet count at t2 minus valid DHCP received packet count at t1). 

            Under the simplifying assumption that the capture of packet counts 
            and times is discontinuous (that is, for the measurement interval 
            the captured data represents the complete set for the server) the 
            variance of the mean may be computed as 
            (dhcpStatSumSquaresArrivalTime at t2 less 
            dhcpStatSumSquaresArrivalTime at t1) divided by (valid DHCP received 
            packet count at t2 less valid DHCP received packet count at t1).  
            Standard deviation of the mean is the square root of the variance. 

            Calculation of statistics for message response time is entirely 
            similar to the calculations for inter-arrival time, except that the 
            response time objects are used for the calculations. 

            Calculation of statistics for BOOTP is similar to the calculations 
            for DHCP, except that the similar objects from the bootStatistics 
            group are used instead of the objects from dhcpStatistics group. 

          2.3. Server Configuration Group 

            The server configuration group contains objects that describe the 
            configuration information that is contained in the server.  Some of 


          Hibbs & Waters        Expires: Nov 2000 + 6 months             [Page 3] 

          Internet Draft              DHCP Server MIB               November 2000 

            the configuration information is static (e.g.: a statically 
            configured IP address) and some of the configuration is dynamic 
            (e.g.: an assigned DHCP lease).  The intent of the server 
            configuration group is to be able to read the server's 
            configuration. Mechanisms outside of the SNMP are currently in use 
            (e.g.: vendor defined solutions) and are being standardized (e.g.: 
            the Directory Enabled Networks [DEN] initiative) to update a 
            server's configuration. 

            The configuration information provides a minimal set of information 
            that most servers should be able to provide.  Each row of the 
            serverSubnetTable lists the subnet, the subnet mask, and the subnet 
            that is equivalent to this subnet.  Equivalence is defined as more 
            than one subnet being present on the same physical media as some 
            other subnet. 

            The serverRangeTable lists the start and end IP addresses of the 
            ranges and the subnet which the range is a member of.  The 
            serverRangeInUse object indicates the amount of the range that is 
            currently in use, either through dynamic allocation or being 
            reserved.  The range size can be computed by taking the difference 
            of the serverRangeStart and serverRangeEnd objects. 

            The serverAddressTable provides information about the static and 
            dynamic addresses that the server contains in its configuration.  
            Addresses may be: 

            o Static, in which case they are predefined though the server's 
              configuration.  Static addresses may or may not have been 
              previously served by the server; 

            o Dynamic, in which case the server has served the addresses at 
              least once.  Leases which have expired MAY appear in the address 
              list; 

            o Configuration-reserved, in which case the address is not 
              available for the server to allocate to a client.  A 
              configuration-reserved address is one that has been reserved by 
              the administrator. An example of a configuration-reserved address 
              is an address that is assigned to a client, not through DHCP 
              (e.g.: statically assigned), and the address is within a DHCP 
              range;  and, 

            o Server-reserved, in which case the server has taken the address 
              out of use.  Examples of server-reserved addresses are those 
              which have been declined (i.e.: through a DHCPDECLINE) by a 
              client or those which have responded to an ICMP echo before they 
              were assigned. 

            The protocol used to allocate the address may be determined from the 
            serverAddressServedProtocol object.  This object indicates whether 
            the address has never been served (value of none(1)), or, whether 
            BOOTP or DHCP was used to allocate the address.

          2.4. Response Times and ICMP Echo 

            According to [RFC2131], servers SHOULD try to determine if an 
            address is in use before assigning it.  Some servers choose not to 
            perform this check, letting the client determine for itself if the 
            address is in use.  Other servers perform an ICMP echo (Ping) just 
            prior to assigning an address.  Servers that perform a Ping before 
            responding to a DHCPDISCOVER should not include in the response time 
            the time from when the Ping was transmitted until the time that 
            either a response was received or that the server timed out waiting 
            for a response.

              enthusiastically supported.  If traps are to be included, that 
              should be done soon. 

            o what is the best way to reset statistics? 

              o do we need to reset them individually, as groups, or as a 
                 whole? 

              o we need a timestamp of when they were reset

          Internet Draft              DHCP Server MIB               November 2000 

            o should all invalid packets received be collapsed into a single 
               counter for each protocol type (BOOTP and DHCP), or broken out by 
               type of error? 

            o if counted by error type, what is the set of errors that we 
               should use? 

            o perhaps we should develop a common vocabulary (and glossary) for 
               terms such as "abandoned" so that the objects defined and their 
               descriptions aren't misinterpreted by implementers. 

            o do we need to be concerned about the potential size of some of 
               the configuration data tables?  Wouldn't it be better to maintain 
               counters for things like number of leases assigned than to expect 
               the management station to calculate the values by reading very 
               large tables to count the number of leases in that state? 

          5.2. Changes from Prior Drafts 

            The "-01" revision removed the Server Identity section from the 
            proposed MIB, relying on the Application MIB to accomplish the same 
            result. 

            The min/max (inter-arrival and response times) were changed to 
            Unsigned32 so that they could be reset.  Sum of inter-arrival and 
            response times was deleted since the management station can easily 
            calculate them.  The last arrival time objects were added. 

            The "-03" version incorporated the proposed configuration tables 
            suggested by Ryan Troll of CMU.  The "01" revision of this version 
            added three elements to the server subnet table, number of 
            outstanding offers, number of addresses in use, and number of free 
            addresses, as well as changing subnet address to subnet mask in the 
            server address, server range, and client address tables.  The client 
            MAC address element of the client address table was separated into a 
            1-octet hardware type and a 16-octet client hardware address, 
            causing a renumbering of the elements in this table.  Clarifying 
            text was added to several element descriptions, and limitations on 
            values, and the reported value when the server did not support the 
            data element were also specified. 

            The "-03b" version incorporated an address change for one of the 
            authors, revisions to standard text required by the IETF, and some 
            editorial clarifications. 

            The "-04" version changed the maximum size of the object 
            serverAddressHostName from 64 to 255 octets, and added clarifying 
            text to both that object and to serverAddressDomainName regarding 
            the practical values for the length of both objects. 

            The "-05" version added a number of traps suggested by Kim Kinnear, 
            made a number of small renaming and renumbering changes (annotated 
            in the MIB itself) and added the Shared Network concept to describe 
            shared network segments:  several subnetworks that coexist on one 
            medium.  This was done partly because the Address Range concept did 
            not adequately describe the "scoping" of address pools as is common 
            with many current server implementations.  Also updated the authors

            address and contact information, and incorporated a number of 
            corrections and amplifications suggested by various readers of the 
            -04 draft, including a missing OID for serverNotifyObjects and a 
            syntax error for PhysicalAddress. 

            The "-05" draft closes several issues raised during peer review 
            discussions on the DHC mailing list, incorporates several new 
            elements, and makes a number of small revisions based on comments 
            from reviewers. 


          6. Acknowledgements 

            This document is the result of work undertaken the by DHCP working 
            group.  The authors would like to particularly acknowledge the 
            development team from Carnegie-Mellon University whose work creating 
            a private MIB for their DHCP server inspired the development of this 
            proposal. In particular, many thanks to Ryan Troll who provided a 
            great deal of useful feedback during the development of this MIB. 

            Thanks to Kim Kinnear, Yannick Koehler, and Nathan Lane for their 
            review, comments, and contributions. 


          7. Security Considerations 

            There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that 
            have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. Such 
            objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some 
            environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
            environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
            network operations. 

            SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network 
            itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is 
            no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and 
            GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB. 

            It is recommended that the implementers consider the security 
            features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use 
            of the User-based Security Model RFC 2274 [RFC2274] and the View-
            based Access Control Model RFC 2275 [RFC2275] is recommended. 

            It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP 
            entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly 
            configured to give access to the objects only to those principals 
            (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET 
            (change/create/delete) them.
