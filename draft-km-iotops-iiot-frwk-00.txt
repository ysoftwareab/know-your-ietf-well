              Framework For Integrated Industrial Networks
                      draft-km-iotops-iiot-frwk-00

Abstract

   Industry control networks host a diverse set of non-internet
   protocols supporting Industrial-IoT and legacy device connections.
   These networks are physically separated from the enterprise networks
   and have been slow to adopt the virtualization technologies.
   Virtualization is necessary to remove the boundaries between the
   enterprise and process control networks.  This document specifies a
   framework for the converged industrial network.  Specifically, it
   focuses on the virtual PLC scenario.  It covers transition
   technologies required for the convergence of industrial devices with
   the enterprise application endpoints.

1.  Introduction

   There is a little cross-over between the network technologies used in
   the Operational Technology (OT) and Information Technology (IT)
   environments as the architecture of industrial networks has evolved
   independently from the IT networks.  While industrial networks
   focussed on deterministic communication, safety, and reliability of
   process control, they have trailed behind in the adoption of
   virtualization capabilities.  Virtualization is necessary for the
   industry automation to enable compute and data-intensive services at
   scale.  Moreover, it is also a necessary tool for the convergence of
   OT and IT systems.

   Although the virtualization of SCADA and other systems (HMI, MES,
   Historian, etc.) has happened, the low-level PLCs have remained on
   the factory floor.  Virtualization of PLC is a topic of great
   interest for fully automated and remote operations in the
   manufacturing and similar process control industry because it allows
   direct control of low-level processes from the applications.

   This memo studies the overall network requirements for support of
   virtualized PLCs and identifies their characteristics.  The benefits
   include:

   *  Flexibility to control the devices from application-level logic
      thus improving automation,

   *  Potentially eliminate need for dedicated PLCs on the floor that
      reduces interconnection and integration overheads.

   *  Ability to leverage high-end general purpose processing platforms
      to perform complex compute intensive operations.

   *  Adapt rapidly to changing business requirements with software,
      avoiding hardware changes.

   Enabling PLC virtualization imposes a set of challenging
   requirements.  Broadly they can be viewed from

   1.  PLC perspective: the mechanisms with which it integrates with
       other business applications while preserving PLC logic, and its
       real-time or deterministic constraints when communicating with
       the devices it interacts with;

   2.  Network perspective: the impact on the network when PLCs are not
       directly connected to devices i.e., requirements to reliably move
       data between the virtualized PLC elements and OT devices
       (sensors, and actuators) while maintaining operational safely.

   This document presents the baseline industrial architecture in
   Section 3 and demonstrates that the current hierarchical architecture
   poses difficulty for the adoption of PLC virtualization in industrial
   networks Section 4.  Section 5 further develops approaches to the
   support for virtualized PLCs.

   A distributed conceptual model that could potentially address the
   above limitations is presented for discussion as a converged
   industrial-network architecture Section 6.  Finally, a summary of
   requirements is extracted in Section 7.

   This document discusses those requirements and proposes a path to
   converged industrial networking.

3.  Industrial Network Architecture

   The physical network architecture for process control and operations
   centric networks as shown in Figure 1 is rigidly hierarchical.  Note
   that the figure is over-simplified and in general, each level will
   have additional hierarchies to extend networks for scale.  For
   example, a PLC that is controlling a group of fieldbus devices may be
   controlled by another PLC controller which runs ProfiNet protocol.
   In such cases protocol translation gateways are needed.  Between
   these gateways there may exist a set of intermediate network switches
   to extend the range (physical distance) and scale (number of devices)
   of connectivity on the factory floor.  Similarly, system integrators
   also need a variety of translation gateways to extract and integrate
   data from field devices as an input to MIS, HMI and other enterprise
   applications.

   The hierarchical architecture comprises of security oriented zones
   that are combined together to represent ICA-95 model (or Purdue model
   see Appendix A) in which each zone further contains well-defined
   levels.  The communication across the zone tends to get complex as
   each zone runs over a different technology.  Among the three zones
   (Manufacturing, IDMZ and Enterprise), the enterprise zone network is
   all IP while manufacturing and IDMZ network on factory floor are a
   combination of IP and Industrial protocols.  IP-based routers are
   used in manufacturing-zone when there is need to extend the network
   across different cells on factory floors.  There are a large number
   of IP based firewalls and gateways that perform translation in IDMZ
   but are required to look at transport payload to determine the
   industrial protocols and corresponding matching rules.

   Higher layer applications directly interact with PLCs for send and
   receive commands and data from the field devices.  The data generated
   by sensors is transmitted by PLCs to industry control systems (SCADA,
   HMI, MES).  Both DCS and SCADA systems collect data from process
   instruments and respond with commands to the actuators.  They control
   several process control loop instances simultaneously to handle
   complex processes.  Originally, such systems were built using
   proprietary hardware and software, operating in its own zone without
   additional connectivity.  Operators had to work from centralized
   control room because these systems did not support remote access.
   The best practices for data delivery to other systems was in the form
   of reports, which caused significant time lag.

   I/O devices (sensors, actuators) generate a large volume of data and
   also accept process control commands.  For an application to handle a
   variety of low-level protocol translations can be extremely
   challenging, therefore, solutions such as OPC-UA [OPC_ARCH] or common
   messaging broker mechanisms MQTT [MQTT_SPEC] are deployed.  While
   OPC-UA is a common representation of data collected from different I/
   O devices; MQTT is messaging service designed for systems with low
   resources.  Both are higher-level protocols that are generally
   transmitted over TCP as shown in Figure 2 below.

4.  Challenges and Limitations

   As is evident from the ICA-95 model (described in Appendix A), the
   business applications are centralized in the enterprise networks.  In
   this network architecture, with PLCs virtualized, they may be
   colocated at the edge of manufacturing zone, with the supervisory
   control systems, or in Enterprise zone along with business
   applications.

   Alternatively, virtualized PLCs enable new capabilities such as
   utilizing cloud to edge-aware network architectures by flexible
   placement of applications and allocation of resources to different
   components in industry control systems.  Virtualzed PLCs serving from
   the edges can meet latency constraints to close the control loop for
   process automation.

4.1.  Associating virtualized PLCs with I/O Devices

   A physical PLC is generally associated with a few I/O devices and is
   directly connected.  The I/O modules are not required to authenticate
   or perform any verification on connection.  As virtualized PLC may be
   on the other side of the network, the I/O device requires an
   authentication mechanism to connect to the PLC.  This is necessary to
   maintain reliability and safety of the system and prevent
   unauthenticated PLC to interact with the software.

4.2.  Expectations from network performance

   Virtualiaton allows consolidation of compute, storage, and network
   resources, as well as independence from custom hardware.  The
   magnitude by which compute capability is improved allows a single
   virtualized controller to handle more complex and faster scan cycles.

      Note: A scan cycle is generally the time taken to read the inputs,
      execute the program (e.g. ladder logic), and update the outputs.
      The actual scan time is affected by the processing speed of the
      PLC, the size of the program, the type of instructions used in the
      program.  Therefore, in virtualized PLCs general-purpose processor
      speed and the amount of memory available is much higher than most
      physical PLCs.

   Then, the performance of the network to handle communicaton delays,
   packet formation, processing and forwarding overheads become critical
   to overall system performance.  Additionally, use of edge-compute
   platforms is expected for both consolidating resource consumption and
   lowering the operational costs.

Internet-Draft               iiot-framework                 January 2022


4.3.  Multiprotocol supporting PLCs

   Another difference between physical and virtualized PLC is that with
   virtualization of PLC, a single controller can communicate with a
   different group of I/O devices over one or more non-internet
   protocols such as Modbus, Profibus, CANbus, Profinet [SURV], etc.
   Each of the protocols specifies its packet format.

   The benefit is a reduction in the number of controllers, but the
   requirement challenge is to provide a standard communication format
   for different I/O devices.  Since it is not feasible to communicate
   packets in native (Fieldbus protocol) format due to address scale
   limitations (field bus devices have limited address space up to 256
   devices), a network element or an end-device is required to perform
   some format translation.

   As an example, a factory floor is composed of different cell sites.
   A set of PLCs controls I/O modules or machines in each cell.
   Traditionally, when there is an inter-connection requirement between
   two or more cells, the protocol translation is carried out between
   the cells.  With physical PLC, the translation would be done at the
   controller, but with virtualized, it may require translation
   capability on the network element connecting to I/O devices or the
   devices themselves.  Moreover, additional deployments are not
   integrated with the existing network, creating a new network.

4.4.  Identification of virtualized PLC

   The fieldbus devices are serial buses and identify PLC as a device
   with a specific bus address.  In the large scale network and in the
   application layer this much information is insufficient.  It may be
   required for virtualized PLC to support dual addresses, one exposed
   for the I/O module and other for IT applications.

   Moreover, as an exmaple, it is no longer sufficient to indicate basic
   address 0x14; it may require to specify 'device 0x14, of cell - C1
   and factory floor, F1, PLC bus address 0x1 in communication path.
   The reachability to a specific I/O module should have complete
   information from virtualized PLC.

4.5.  Security Aspects

   The fundamental paradigm of security as expressed in ICA-95
   architecture changes with virtualized PLC since the PLCs are now
   moved away from the local manufacturing zone.  The zone based
   security design considerations can employ either or both of the
   approaches:

   1.  Describe mechanisms to abstract the manufacturing and other
       zones.  This maybe achieved using secure communication channel
       approaches such as such as VPN, IPSEC etc.  In this approach
       traffic admission policies applied on a PLC, will now be applied
       on traffic entering virtual PLC.

   2.  Describe mechanisms for location-specifc (site) perimeter
       security.  This maybe achieved using conventional firewall
       methods.

   When zone-based secuity rules are leveraged, location-specific
   security policies may be more coarse grained.  For example, an
   ingress firewall rule will be required to verify and authenticate
   that the source site is permitted to send traffic for specified
   destination.

5.  Evolving Networks for virtualized PLCs

   This section conceptualizes a fully virtualized industrial control
   system in which all the components - network, compute, storage, and
   applications run on virtual platforms to better understand the gaps
   and requirements.

5.1.  Virtualization of Components in Industrial Systems

   Virtualization enables the separation of software from hardware.  It
   is the foundation for disaggregating different system components such
   as operating systems, management tools, service logic, and data.

   In the case of industrial control systems, by virtualizing SCADA,
   MES, and HMI, etc.  [VPLC_CONV], these softwarized systems are run on
   commodity hardware or general-purpose CPUs.  Main benefit of
   virtualizing supervisory and control systems is that the overall cost
   can be controlled since specialized hardware is not required, while
   operators can perform software upgrades more frequently.  Such
   virtualized software can be placed anywhere, often close to the
   source of data it needs to process.  This, in turn, leads to
   leveraging edge compute networking for multi-site integration.

   While applications and services are beginning to get disaggregated,
   PLCs' virtualization is very early stage.  Conceptually, a virtual
   PLC means that the controller functions are separated from the I/O
   modules of the devices.

5.2.  Incremental Approaches

   Similar to SCADA, MES, HMIs, virtualized PLC may be located anywhere
   in industry control architecture.  However, expanding beyond a
   factory cite, requires special security considerations discuss in
   Section 4.5.  Adding new virtualization capabilities may require and
   overall redesign of the network infrastructure which may not
   desirable in all the cases specifically, from the perspective of
   maintaining same level of security, reliability and safety
   requirements.

   Therefore, we envision that the following different approaches are
   possible:

5.2.1.  Softwarized

   This is the basic approach with minimal change and minimal impact.  A
   PLC software is virtualized and runs on a commodity hardware
   supporting legacy interfaces to I/O modules.  This type of change is
   isolated to a specific PLC functionality and the only benefit is use
   of commodity hardware.  Potentially, there is a one to one
   replacement of physical to software PLC.

5.2.2.  Localized

   In this approach PLC is virtualized and can run on a commodity
   hardware as above; additionally providing a clear separation between
   hardware and software components by relying on protocol translation
   gateways as part of the network edges that connect to I/O modules
   conceptually represented in Figure 3.

   Depending on the compute capabilities of the hardware, different
   instances of virtualized PLC may run simultaneously or a group of
   PLCs are bundled together in a single instance of virtualized PLC.
   Furthermore, a virtualized PLC maybe hosted on the same hardware
   along with SCADA or ICS components.

   There are two new concepts that will need to be formalized: - The I/O
   translation gateways are a new component in ICA architecture.  These
   are interface translators on an edge network element devices that
   perform conversion of network side PDU to device side PDU. -
   identification of the virtualized PLC as discussed in Section 4.4.

   The incremental benefit beyond the use of commodity hardware is the
   ability of encapsulating complex logic in a single instance.  A clean
   separation between PLC logic from I/O module allows changes to PLC
   logic and I/O devices independently.  Since the location of
   virtualized PLC is with in manufacturing zone there is no impact on
   the security design.

5.2.3.  Distributed

   This is the eventual goal to support virtualized PLC in a location
   independent manner.  All benefits considered in Section 5.2.2 apply
   with an advantage of leveraging third-party edge-compute
   infrastructure as a tenant.

   However, security zones are impacted as discussed in Section 4.5.

6.  Converged Architectural Concepts

   Since a virtualized PLC now looks like an IT-centric software
   component with OT-specific capabilities, the industrial network
   framework should evolve accordingly to handle virtual entities in the
   network.  This is referred to as a converged network architecture and
   its conceptual model with significant functions, components and
   interfaces are discussed in this section.

   The foundational concepts of converged industry network architecture
   has three design principles (i) Ability to virtualize end-points,
   (ii) Disaggregation of I/O Devices, and (iii) Converged industry-
   network fabric to support communication between virtualized endpoints
   and I/O modules.

6.1.  Overview

   Figure 4 represents a converged network fabric (bottom-left) that
   enables the transfer of data between software system components (top-
   left) and the physical devices (bottom-right).  The fabric is a
   shared network infrastructure that allows all the characteristics
   required in the industrial control networks, such as deterministic,
   low-latency, and real-time communications.

   In Figure 4, "B. factory site" represents one or more cell
   (locations) of the physical devices.  Each cell group belongs to one
   physical site, and there can be multiple such sites.  A cell site may
   be the smallest network in this fabric.

   "A.  Software components" emulate different OT and IT functions
   hosted in a cloud-like environment which is distributed, i.e.,
   components may be located at various sites or at the edge to support
   low-latency, deterministic applications.  Both field and software
   components are connected over a converged network (shown as "C.
   <network"> in Figure 4), which presents a unified view of the network
   infrastructure interconnecting software and field components.

   The converged fabric is composed of 3 types of network elements with
   specific roles.

   CISN (Converged Industry Service Node):
      The application or service nodes that get virtualized and
      softwarized maybe instantiated anywhere in the Industry network
      independent of the I/O module placement.  They are placed in cloud
      or at the edge or the factory floor itself depending on the usage
      and type of application.  From the communication perspective,
      these nodes following the state of the art in IT could use
      technologies and protocol such as IPv6 addresses [RFC8200], and
      service chains [RFC8300] for steering between different service
      nodes.  Their interface to network will have specific transport
      requirements (when not transmitted as overlay).

   CIFR (Converged Industry Fabric Router):
      Network nodes that form the converged fabric and understand the
      traffic flows between I/O modules and applications.  CIFRs are all
      expected to run a uniform suite of protocols.  In a much
      simplified view the fabric maybe a core IPv4 or IPv6 based
      forwarding plane, regardless whether overlay technologies (such as
      VPN, VxLAN etc.) are used).  Potentially interconnected over
      different physical media technologies (commodity or TSN) Ethernet.

  
      CIFRs also perform functions for WAN interfaces and multi site
      interconnections.  The routers performing this function will be at
      the upper edge of the physical network.

   CIIG (Converged I/O-Gateways)  These gateways are the lower-level
      edges of the converged fabric.They are very similar to the
      existing PLC gateways that are purpose-built for translation
      between fieldbus/fieldbus or fieldbus/IT protocols.  In contrast
      to traditional gateways CIIGs could be stateless and optionally
      provide more secure control to I/O device.

6.2.  Component Virtualization

   In the existing deployments, components such as HMI, Historian, MES,
   and SCADA systems run on dedicated hardware.  Virtualizing these
   system components can be consolidated on a single general-purpose
   hardware platform, reducing the number of hardware devices and
   improving the security of data exchanges among these systems.

6.2.1.  Virtualized PLC

   A virtualized PLC decouples controller logic from the I/O component.
   It allows integration of supervisory and control software components
   as part of the execution environment by leveraging mature IP-based
   technologies.

   Although an exploratory work [VPLC_CONV] and [VPLC_IIC] propose I/O
   field-buses to be replaced with the high-speed, deterministic media
   (such as Ethernet).  The legacy systems (such as serial fieldbus
   interfaces) will continue to exist in the foreseeable future.  Thus,
   the architecture must support the communication between the field-bus
   I/O and PLCs, even when the PLCs are virtualized.  This implies that
   in some cases the fabric will still need protocol translation
   gateways on cell sites, but they need to be close to the the I/O
   modules i.e. at the edge of the converged fabric.

6.2.2.  Application and Services

   Component virtualization enables co-location of different service
   functions on the same hypervisor or entirely at a different location
   regardless of what security zone they belong to.  The constraints
   aware path chain can be set using [RFC7665].  Moreover, it provides
   multiple service function chain to support different applications.
   This type of architecture along with NFV [ETSI_GS_NFV_003] can be
   extremely resource efficient.

   Several sensors emit time-series data, that can add to the bandwidth
   consumption to the information going to the cloud.  Deploying big-
   data application closer on the edge and scale them on-demand provides
   a sophisticated tool to disaggregate processing of sensory data and
   summarize for the cloud-enterprise applications.

6.3.  I/O Modules and Field Components

   A manufacturing facility can be located at more than one site and
   each site is further divided into cells.  Further the machinery,
   actuators, sensors are associated with the cell connected to the
   PLCs.  These controllers run different protocols such as Ethernet,
   RT-Ethernet, Modbus, ProfiNet etc.

   In a vPLC supported environment, the I/O cards are responsible for
   media access conversion from in and out of the converged fabric.
   Even the support for legacy PLCs is similar to vPLCs, with the role
   reduced to only translation function.

6.4.  Converged Fabric

   Converged fabric shown as "B." in Figure 4 is central to the
   architecture.  The connectivity is largely Ethernet based (except I/O
   device interfaces), potentially running IP protocols on the switches
   and routers in the network.

   Since this is a logical fabric, the connectivity is local on a
   factory floor and can be extended to multiple sites.  Interconnecting
   different sites will use WAN functions.  The fabric breaks the
   hierarchical structure and topology can now be designed as fat-tree
   (or leaf-spine) network which provides overall more number and
   multiple deterministic paths between two end points.

   A key characteristic of legacy Industry networks is that they do not
   require frequent changes and therefore, topology changes are not
   dynamic.  The fabric could potentially use a combination of software-
   defined connectivity with IP routing protocols.  The routing
   protocols will maintain the infrastructure reachability among the
   network nodes and software-defined solutions will manage flow of
   traffic in a deterministic manner addressing the low-latency and
   deterministic data delivery of certain type of flows.

7.  Requirements

7.1.  General Requirements

   *  Basic requirement for converged fabric is the efficiency of
      connections between the IT software and floor I/O modules or
      modules, i.e. the connection to a low-level factory devices is
      uniform (or homogenized) manner.  Uniformity implies a variety of
      endpoints interconnect in an identical fashion without requiring
      device specific translations.  Efficient connections lead to less
      processing or states in the network with improved resiliency and
      performance.  There maybe opportunities to design packet formats
      with minimal overheads by using in-band programmability paradigms
      that carry embedded metadata and control information relating to
      reachability, latency, jitter, reliability, and exceptions
      characteristics.  This type of approach is expected to reduce
      configurations and number of policies required for data steering
      through the network.  Existing methods that maybe used, evaluated
      or extended include IP with TSN, DETNET[DETNET], reachability
      headers SCHC, IPv6 compression schemes or may be evaluated against
      newer schemes.

   *  The converged-fabric shall support traffic segmentation.  As
      connections change between the devices, it should not have adverse
      effect on deterministic, low latency behavior on the other



Makhijani & Dong          Expires 20 July 2022                 [Page 16]

Internet-Draft               iiot-framework                 January 2022


      segmented traffic.  Each segmented traffic may be associated with
      a different protocol or traffic profile including legacy traffic
      format and profiles.  In case the fabric supports legacy traffic
      flow or devices, its performance should be no worse than before
      the fabric.  The methods to support segmentation include virtual
      network technologies inside the fabric such as VxLAN, VPNs, etc.

   *  The fabric protocols used must not limit to a constrained physical
      topology.  It should support efficient multi-path distributed
      connectivity framework to prevent bottlenecks, traffic
      concentration.  Even in the industrial networks growth in data-
      generation is obvious as more number of telemetry and reporting
      sensors are being added in the system.  Managing bandwidth for
      different types of data (operational, control, statistics) should
      be considered.  It is expected that an entire cell may be added or
      removed on-demand.  This type of changes shall be dynamic (i.e.
      does not require long-term planning) and non disruptive (no impact
      on existing performance metrics) to other traffic-paths in the
      network.  These characteristics scale better with layer-3 network
      designs.

   *  The fabric is a logical representation of LAN and WAN connections.
      The traffic ICA-95 zone-transfer may happen anywhere in the
      logical topology.  In this regard, appropriate perimeter or zone
      admission policies MUST be designed and enforced in such a manner
      that are not bound to a specific location.  Alternately, it may
      require two-stage policies first one to validate traffic conforms
      to the zone policies and second conforming to specific service
      behavior.  A potential approach here could be the use of semantic
      addressing
      [I-D.draft-farrel-irtf-introduction-to-semantic-routing] where
      part of the addresses may describe match rules for zones and
      services.

7.2.  Device Specific Requirements

   Device functions and operation does not change.  The requirements
   here are related to how that are reached, identified and discovered
   in the network.

   *  Addresses scope: As the scale of industry network grows, there
      will be many same type of devices with limited address space (a
      fieldbus or ModBus address limits up to 256) all across the floor.
      Therefore, a structured addressing scheme is necessary to uniquely
      identify each device from the operator's command center.

Internet-Draft               iiot-framework                 January 2022


   *  Converged Namespace: Each industry vertical could have different
      preferences for how it chooses to view devices and applications in
      the system.  It should be possible to identify all the endpoints
      as part of a system defined namespace.  The solution should not
      require different operations and management schemes for industry
      I/O modules vs IT applications.  A common namespace that aligns
      with business goals can simplify management.  For example,
      assigning segmented identifiers for each level (PLCs, cell sites,
      type of application etc.) and concatenating them together provides
      helps industry operations considering that factory devices do not
      change their location often in the topology.

   *  Network Identifiers: Each device should be identifiable in the
      network by what application it can talk to.  The network
      identification should be provided for setting up security or
      firewall policies.  Note: today legacy devices do not have network
      identifiers.  With virtual instances of PLCs, it is to be
      determined how different instances of the same PLC will be
      identified, discovered and associated.  Moreover, it maybe
      desirable to support variable length identifiers to handle both IT
      servers and I/O module type devices.

   *  Legacy support: Architecture must provide legacy device support
      for deployed protocol formats and their core capabilities.  This
      is needed to maintain non-disruptive operations.

   *  Once part of the larger fabric, the devices must be discoverable.
      Given the 'physical-location' of the device can often be
      preprogrammed, device on-boarding should allow a device to be
      auto-configurable.

   *  The auto configuration procedures should be efficient, i.e.,
      comparable to the processing capabilities of the I/O devices.

   *  On-boarding procedures (manual or automatic) must have built-in or
      well-defined authentication procedures.

   *  Device policies: Each device connects to at least one controller
      (PLC or a gateway).  When the network detects a misbehaving
      controller, the policies should define the default behavior of the
      device (such as quarantined from the network along with the
      gateway or allow it to operate autonomously with default settings,
      or shutdown etc).

   Further motivation and analysis for adapting to OT/IT asymmetric
   address formats is covered in
   [I-D.draft-km-industrial-internet-requirements].

7.3.  Key Performance Indicator Requirements

   *  Performance of industry operations depend on the deterministic
      behavior of devices.  The network must preserve and support this
      attribute such as the legacy device connections with controllers.

   *  Safety mechanisms : To keep a factory floor hazard and accident
      free environment, the system should implement built-in mechanisms
      for proper operation of a devices (i.e. software commands sent
      from vPLC must not exceed thresholds).

   *  Security: mechanisms should be implemented to protect man-in-the-
      middle attack.  Knowing that E2E encryption procedures on device
      can impact low-latency, due to low processing power, light-weight
      mechanisms should be devised (such as reduce the data to be
      encrypted, account it in KPIs, etc).

7.4.  Virtualization Related Requirements

   The topologies in the manufacturing zones do not change frequently
   and devices are designated in a zone or a cell for long-term use.
   Such observations can help simplify network designs.  As such,
   industry networks substantially benefit from a hybrid approach of
   software-defined networking and distributed routing.  Former for
   initial provisioning, latter for reachability and health of the
   fabric.  Such hybrid approaches eliminates the need for complex
   routing protocol features.

   *  Edge compute and networking - TBD.

7.5.  Virtualized PLC Requirements

   *  Solution must provide a secure method of pairing, authenticating a
      virtualized PLCs with their I/O devices.

   *  Virtualization allows multiple PLCs to control the same device.
      This can potentially lead to conflicts in device operation.
      Therefore, careful policies are required to prioritize operation
      across the PLCs.

   *  Currently, L0 and L1 devices (ICA_95) do not use any transport
      protocol.  The data is embedded after control header.  With a
      network layer solution, TCP maybe too heavy for field-bus devices.
      Some other means of assuring device delivery will be needed.

Appendix A.  Appendix A.  Purdue Model (ICA-95)

   The International Society of Automation (ICA) has developed a model
   [ISA95] to describe automated interfaces between enterprise and
   control systems.  In this widely deployed hierarchical model, five
   levels are defined and they follow a strict ordering of interfaces
   across the levels.  At the lowest level 0, are the physical devices
   while enterprise applications are at level 5.  In between these two
   levels, there are several supervisory, management, and intermediate
   data collection applications that provide information to

     |      +-------------------------------+  Enterprise

     |      +-------------------------------+
     | L4   | Gateways, servers (ops, mgmt) |  IDMZ

A.1.  Separation between Manufacturing and Enterprise Networks

   The ICA-95 architecture recommends hierarchy, thereby a separation
   between factory devices and applications through three different
   security zones called Manufacturing, DMZ and enterprise zones as
   shown in Figure 5 as below:

   *  Enterprise Security Zone:  The IT applications reside in

         enterprise networks and perform tasks necessary for business
         operations such as inventory control, supply-chain logistics,
         schedule and capacity planning.  They need to collect data from
         the OT systems in order to make those decisions.

   *  Industrial Demilitarized Zone:  The OT and IT networks were
         designed to prevent direct communication between them.  The
         IDMZ serves as an information sharing layer between the IT and
         OT (L4 and L3) systems.  This indicates that additional
         security rules, inspection and protection of device identity
         and access is necessary when transiting from L3 to L4.

   *  Manufacturing Zone:  Consists of Levels 0 through 3 site wide
         production system.  Operations at level 3 (L3) Support site-
         wide view of the production system.  They also provide data to
         L4.  Area supervisory control (L2) performs operation and
         control over a zone or smaller area in a production floor.
         Each area has specific set of tasks or operations to perform.
         Basic control at level 1 (L1) is for the actual control of the
         equipment.  The L1 components such include PLCs; they send
         commands to L0 equipments to perform tasks (e.g. start motor,
         alter pressure level, or reduce motor speed).  Finally, actual
         process takes place at level 0 (L0).  At this level for the
         process equipments performing actual operations are performed.
         This include equipment and devices such as motors, pressure
         valves, temperature, speed, etc sensors, etc.

   The devices or controllers at level 1 are the ones of specific
   interest for virtualization and the corresponding challenges are
   covered in later section.

A.2.  Collaborating with SDOs with Industry Network Focus

   The paradigms of networking in OT are quite different than IP based
   best-effort networking protocols.  Yet, IETF protocols are
   extensively used in OT applications.  Often, it is not possible to
   get contributors directly from the OT sectors, then it would make
   more sense to coordinate with well-established consortia where OT
   scenarios and requirements are is discussed may be utilized.  Two
   well established foundations are IIC [IIC] and OPC-UA [OPC].  For
   example, a [IIC_TALK] provided overview of IIC activities.

   Industrial IoT Consortium (IIC) provides use cases, scenarios, and
   best-practice frameworks to solve specific problems and solution pain
   points.  It is a rich resources of case studies and demonstrations of
   different test beds.  The IIC itself is not involved in standards
   development, but may help in formalizing requirements, further
   insights into solutions developed in IETF, and potentially help
   adoption of those solutions.

   Open Platform Communications-Unified Architecture (OPC-UA) provides
   interoperability across different hardware platforms using a standard
   data model.  It standardizes various information models,
   corresponding client-server architecture and defines necessary access
   mechanisms to those information models.  The OPC-UA is an abstraction
   layer to provide common interface to different data look-up and event
   notifications.  A number of information models are provided by OPC-UA
   can be found here [OPC_INFO].  Foe example, OPC has a specification
   on PLCs.  It abstracts PLC specific protocols (such as Modbus,
   Profibus, etc.) into a standardized interface allowing HMI/SCADA
   systems to interface with a middleware that converts generic-OPC
   read/write requests into device-specific requests and vice-versa.

      Note: OPC-UA information model similar to YANG?

   IETF solutions will focus on leveraging or extending IETF
   technologies for IT and OT integration which is at the infrastructure
   or communication layer.  Thus, providing protocols that could
   potentially benefit higher-level OPC-UA work.

   Both IIC and OPC could provide guidance to the lower level work.

   *  For Discussion: assuming there is an IIN framework - how does it
      fit in the OPC-UA architecture and facilitate adoption of existing
      information models.
