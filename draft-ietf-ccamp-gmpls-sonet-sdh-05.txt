Abstract 
    
   This document is a companion to the Generalized Multiprotocol 
   Label Switching (GMPLS) signaling.  It defines the SONET/SDH 
   technology specific information needed when using GMPLS signaling. 
    
    
1. Introduction 
    
   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) extends MPLS from supporting packet 
   (Packet Switching Capable - PSC) interfaces and switching to 
   include support of four new classes of interfaces and switching: 
   Layer-2 Switch Capable (L2SC), Time-Division Multiplex (TDM), 
   Lambda Switch Capable (LSC) and Fiber-Switch Capable (FSC). A 
   functional description of the extensions to MPLS signaling needed 
   to support the new classes of interfaces and switching is provided 
   in [GMPLS-SIG]. [GMPLS-RSVP] describes RSVP-TE specific formats 
   and mechanisms needed to support all five classes of interfaces, 
   and CR-LDP extensions can be found in [GMPLS-LDP]. This document 
   presents details that are specific to SONET/SDH. Per [GMPLS-SIG], 
   SONET/SDH specific parameters are carried in the signaling 
   protocol in traffic parameter specific objects. 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" 
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 
    
    
2. SONET and SDH Traffic Parameters 
    
   This section defines the GMPLS traffic parameters for SONET/SDH. 
   The protocol specific formats, for the SDH/SONET-specific RSVP-TE 
   objects and CR-LDP TLVs are described in sections 2.2 and 2.3 
   respectively. 
    
   These traffic parameters specify indeed a base set of capabilities 
   for SONET (ANSI T1.105) and SDH (ITU-T G.707) such as 
   concatenation and transparency. Some extra non-standard 
   capabilities are defined in [GMPLS-SONET-SDH-EXT]. Other documents 
   could further enhance this set of capabilities in the future. For 
   instance, signaling for SDH over PDH (ITU-T G.832), or sub-STM-0 
   (ITU-T G.708) interfaces could be defined. 
    
   The traffic parameters defined hereafter MUST be used when 
   SONET/SDH is specified in the LSP Encoding Type field of a 
   Generalized Label Request [GMPLS-SIG].

   Annex 1 defines examples of SONET and SDH signal coding. 
    
   Signal Type (ST): 8 bits 
    
     This field indicates the type of Elementary Signal that 
     comprises the requested LSP. Several transforms can be applied 
     successively on the Elementary Signal to build the Final Signal 
     being actually requested for the LSP. 
      
     Each transform is optional and must be ignored if zero, except 
     MT that cannot be zero and is ignored if equal to one. 
      
     Transforms must be applied strictly in the following order: 
    
      - First, contiguous concatenation (by using the RCC and NCC 
        fields) can be optionally applied on the Elementary Signal, 
        resulting in a contiguously concatenated signal. 
      - Second, virtual concatenation (by using the NVC field) can 
        be optionally applied either directly on the Elementary 
        Signal, or on the contiguously concatenated signal obtained 
        from the previous phase (see [GMPLS-SONET-SDH-EXT]). 
      - Third, some transparency can be optionally specified when 
        requesting a frame as signal rather than an SPE or VC based 
        signal (by using the Transparency field). 
      - Fourth, a multiplication (by using the Multiplier field) can be 
        optionally applied either directly on the Elementary Signal, or 
        on the contiguously concatenated signal obtained from the first 
        phase, or on the virtually concatenated signal obtained from 
        the second phase, or on these signals combined with some 
        transparency.

   Permitted Signal Type values for SONET/SDH are: 
    
       Value      Type 
       -----  ----------------- 
        1    VT1.5  SPE / VC-11 
        2    VT2    SPE / VC-12 
        3    VT3    SPE 
        4    VT6    SPE / VC-2 
        5    STS-1  SPE / VC-3 
        6    STS-3c SPE / VC-4 
        7    STS-1      / STM-0   (only when requesting transparency) 
        8    STS-3      / STM-1   (only when requesting transparency) 
        9    STS-12     / STM-4   (only when requesting transparency) 
        10   STS-48     / STM-16  (only when requesting transparency) 
        11   STS-192    / STM-64  (only when requesting transparency) 
        12   STS-768    / STM-256 (only when requesting transparency) 
      
     A dedicated signal type is assigned to a SONET STS-3c SPE instead 
     of coding it as a contiguous concatenation of three STS-1 SPEs. 
     This is done in order to provide easy interworking between SONET 
     and SDH signaling. 
      
     Appendix 1 adds one more signal type (optional). Refer to [GMPLS-
     SDH-SONET-EXT] for an extended set of signal type values beyond 
     the signal types as defined in T1.105/G.707.  
 
   Requested Contiguous Concatenation (RCC): 8 bits 
    
     This field is used to request and sometimes negotiate (see 
     [GMPLS-SDH-SONET-EXT]) the optional SONET/SDH contiguous 
     concatenation of the Elementary Signal. 
      
     This field is a vector of flags. Each flag indicates the 
     support of a particular type of contiguous concatenation. 
     Several flags can be set at the same time to indicate a choice.  
      
     These flags allow an upstream node to indicate to a downstream 
     node the different types of contiguous concatenation that it 
     supports. However, the downstream node decides which one to use 
     according to its own rules. 
      
     A downstream node receiving simultaneously more than one flag 
     chooses a particular type of contiguous concatenation, if any 
     supported, and based on criteria that are out of this document 
     scope. A downstream node that doesnÆt support any of the 
     concatenation types indicated by the field must refuse the LSP 
     request. In particular, it must refuse the LSP request if it 
     doesnÆt support contiguous concatenation at all. 
      
     The upstream node knows which type of contiguous concatenation 
     the downstream node chosen by looking at the position indicated 
     by the first label and the number of label(s) as returned by 
     the downstream node.

     The entire field is set to zero to indicate that no contiguous 
     concatenation is requested at all (default value). A non-zero 
     field indicates that some contiguous concatenation is 
     requested. 
      
     The following flag is defined: 
      
         Flag 1 (bit 1): Standard contiguous concatenation. 
      
     Flag 1 indicates that only the standard SONET/SDH contiguous 
     concatenation as defined in T1.105/G.707 is supported. Note 
     that bit 1 is the low order bit. Other flags are reserved for 
     extensions, if not used they must be set to zero when sent, and 
     should be ignored when received. 
      
     See note 1 hereafter in the section on the NCC about the SONET 
     contiguous concatenation of STS-1 SPEs when the number of 
     components is a multiple of three. 
      
     Refer to [GMPLS-SONET-SDH-EXT] for an extended set of contiguous 
     concatenation types beyond the contiguous concatenation types as 
     defined in T1.105/G.707. 
 
   Number of Contiguous Components (NCC): 16 bits 
    
     This field indicates the number of identical SONET/SDH SPEs/VCs 
     that are requested to be concatenated, as specified in the RCC 
     field. 
      
     Note 1: when requesting a SONET STS-Nc SPE with N=3*X, the 
     elementary signal to use must always be an STS-3c SPE signal 
     type and the value of NCC must always be equal to X. This 
     allows also facilitating the interworking between SONET and 
     SDH. In particular, it means that the contiguous concatenation 
     of three STS-1 SPEs cannot not be requested because according 
     to this specification, this type of signal must be coded using 
     the STS-3c SPE signal type. 
      
     Note 2: when requesting a transparent STM-N/STS-N signal 
     limited to a single contiguously concatenated VC-4-Nc/STS-Nc-
     SPE, the signal type must be STM-N/STS-N, RCC with flag 1 and 
     NCC set to 1. 
      
     This field is irrelevant if no contiguous concatenation is 
     requested (RCC = 0), in that case it must be set to zero when 
     send, and should be ignored when received. A RCC value 
     different from 0 must imply a number of components greater than 
     1. The NCC value must be consistent with the type of contiguous 
     concatenation being requested in the RCC field.

   Number of Virtual Components (NVC): 16 bits 
      
     This field indicates the number of signals that are requested 
     to be virtually concatenated. These signals are all of the same 
     type by definition. They are Elementary Signal SPEs/VCs for 
     which signal types are defined in this document, i.e. VT1.5 
     SPE, VT2 SPE, VT3 SPE, VT6 SPE, STS-1 SPE, STS-3c SPE, VC-11, 
     VC-12, VC-2, VC-3 or VC-4. 
      
     This field is set to 0 (default value) to indicate that no 
     virtual concatenation is requested. 
      
     Refer to [GMPLS-SONET-SDH-EXT] for an extended set of signals that 
     can be virtually concatenated beyond the virtual concatenation as 
     defined in T1.105/G.707. 
      
   Multiplier (MT): 16 bits 
      
     This field indicates the number of identical signals that are 
     requested for the LSP, i.e. that form the Final Signal. These 
     signals can be either identical Elementary Signals, or 
     identical contiguously concatenated signals, or identical 
     virtually concatenated signals. Note that all these signals 
     belong thus to the same LSP. 
      
     The distinction between the components of multiple virtually 
     concatenated signals is done via the order of the labels that 
     are specified in the signaling. The first set of labels must 
     describe the first component (set of individual signals 
     belonging to the first virtual concatenated signal), the second 
     set must describe the second component (set of individual 
     signals belonging to the second virtual concatenated signal) 
     and so on. 
      
     This field is set to one (default value) to indicate that 
     exactly one instance of a signal is being requested. Zero is an 
     invalid value. 
      
   Transparency (T): 32 bits 
    
     This field is a vector of flags that indicates the type of 
     transparency being requested. Several flags can be combined to 
     provide different types of transparency. Not all combinations 
     are necessarily valid. The default value for this field is 
     zero, i.e. no transparency requested. 
      
     Transparency, as defined from the point of view of this 
     signaling specification, is only applicable to the fields in 
     the SONET/SDH frame overheads. In the SONET case, these are the 
     fields in the Section Overhead (SOH), and the Line Overhead 
     (LOH). In the SDH case, these are the fields in the Regenerator 
     Section Overhead (RSOH), the Multiplex Section overhead (MSOH), 
     and the pointer fields between the two. With SONET, the pointer 
     fields are part of the LOH.

     Note as well that transparency is only applicable when using 
     the following Signal Types: STM-0, STM-1, STM-4, STM-16, STM-
     64, STM-256, STS-1, STS-3, STS-12, STS-48, STS-192, and STS-
     768. At least one transparency type must be specified when 
     requesting such a signal type. 
      
     Transparency indicates precisely which fields in these 
     overheads must be delivered unmodified at the other end of the 
     LSP. An ingress LSR requesting transparency will pass these 
     overhead fields that must be delivered to the egress LSR 
     without any change. From the ingress and egress LSRs point of 
     views, these fields must be seen as unmodified. 
      
     Transparency is not applied at the interfaces with the 
     initiating and terminating LSRs, but is only applied between 
     intermediate LSRs.  
      
     The transparency field is used to request an LSP that supports 
     the requested transparency type; it may also be used to setup 
     the transparency process to be applied in each intermediate 
     LSR. 
      
     The different transparency flags are the following: 
      
        Flag 1 (bit 1): Section/Regenerator Section layer. 
        Flag 2 (bit 2): Line/Multiplex Section layer. 
      
     Where bit 1 is the low order bit. Others flags are reserved, 
     they should be set to zero when sent, and should be ignored 
     when received. A flag is set to one to indicate that the 
     corresponding transparency is requested. 
      
     Section/Regenerator Section layer transparency means that the 
     entire frames must be delivered unmodified. This implies that 
     pointers cannot be adjusted. When using Section/Regenerator 
     Section layer transparency all other flags must be ignored. 
      
     Line/Multiplex Section layer transparency means that the 
     LOH/MSOH must be delivered unmodified. This implies that 
     pointers cannot be adjusted.  
      
     Refer to [GMPLS-SONET-SDH-EXT] for an extended set of transparency 
     types beyond the transparency types as defined in T1.105/G.707. 
    
   Profile (P) 
    
     This field is intended to indicate particular capabilities that 
     must be supported for the LSP, for example monitoring 
     capabilities. 
      
     No standard profile is currently defined and this field SHOULD 
     be set to zero when transmitted and SHOULD be ignored when 
     received.

2.2. RSVP-TE Details 
    
   For RSVP-TE, the SONET/SDH traffic parameters are carried in the 
   SONET/SDH SENDER_TSPEC and FLOWSPEC objects.  The same format is 
   used both for SENDER_TSPEC object and FLOWSPEC objects. The 
   content of the objects is defined above in Section 2.1. The 
   objects have the following class and type: 
 
    For SONET ANSI T1.105 and SDH ITU-T G.707: 
    
    SONET/SDH SENDER_TSPEC object: Class = 12, C-Type = TBA (by IANA) 
    SONET/SDH FLOWSPEC object: Class = 9, C-Type = TBA (by IANA) 
    
   There is no Adspec associated with the SONET/SDH SENDER_TSPEC. 
   Either the Adspec is omitted or an int-serv Adspec with the 
   Default General Characterization Parameters and Guaranteed Service 
   fragment is used, see [RFC2210]. 
    
   For a particular sender in a session the contents of the FLOWSPEC 
   object received in a Resv message SHOULD be identical to the 
   contents of the SENDER_TSPEC object received in the corresponding 
   Path message. If the objects do not match, a ResvErr message with 
   a "Traffic Control Error/Bad Flowspec value" error SHOULD be 
   generated. 
 
 
2.3. CR-LDP Details 
    
   For CR-LDP, the SONET/SDH traffic parameters are carried in the 
   SONET/SDH Traffic Parameters TLV.  The content of the TLV is 
   defined above in Section 2.1. The header of the TLV has the 
   following format: 
    
    0                   1                   2                   3

3. SDH and SONET Labels 
    
   SDH and SONET each define a multiplexing structure, with the SONET 
   multiplex structure being a subset of the SDH multiplex structure. 
   These two structures are trees whose roots are respectively an 
   STM-N or an STS-N; and whose leaves are the signals that can be 
   transported via the time-slots and switched between time-slots 
   within an ingress port and time-slots within an egress port, i.e. 
   a VC-x, a VT-x SPE or an STS-x SPE. An SDH/SONET label will 
   identify the exact position (i.e. first time-slot) of a particular 
   VC-x, VT-x SPE or STS-x SPE signal in a multiplexing structure. 
   SDH and SONET labels are carried in the Generalized Label per 
   [GMPLS-RSVP] and [GMPLS-LDP]. 
    
   Note that by time-slots we mean the time-slots as they appear 
   logically and sequentially in the multiplex, not as they appear 
   after any possible interleaving. 
    
   These multiplexing structures will be used as naming trees to 
   create unique multiplex entry names or labels. Since the SONET 
   multiplexing structure may be seen as a subset of the SDH 
   multiplexing structure, the same format of label is used for SDH 
   and SONET. As explained in [GMPLS-SIG], a label does not identify 
   the "class" to which the label belongs. This is implicitly 
   determined by the link on which the label is used. 
    
   In case of signal concatenation or multiplication, a list of 
   labels can appear in the Label field of a Generalized Label. 
    
   In case of contiguous concatenation, only one label appears in the 
   Label field. This label identifies the lowest time-slot occupied 
   by the contiguously concatenated signal. By lowest time-slot we 
   mean the one having the lowest label when compared as integer 
   values, i.e. the time-slot occupied by the first component signal 
   of the concatenated signal encountered when descending the tree. 
    
   In case of virtual concatenation, the explicit ordered list of all 
   labels in the concatenation is given. Each label indicates the 
   first time-slot occupied by a component of the virtually 
   concatenated signal. The order of the labels must reflect the 
   order of the payloads to concatenate (not the physical order of 
   time-slots). The above representation limits virtual concatenation 
   to remain within a single (component) link; it imposes as such a 
   restriction compared to the G.707/T1.105 recommendations. 
    
   The standard definition for virtual concatenation allows each 
   virtual concatenation components to travel over diverse paths. 
   Within GMPLS, virtual concatenation components must travel over 
   the same (component) link if they are part of the same LSP. This 
   is due to the way that labels are bound to a (component) link. 
   Note however, that the routing of components on different paths is 
   indeed equivalent to establishing different LSPs, each one having 
   its own route. Several LSPs can be initiated and terminated

   between the same nodes and their corresponding components can then 
   be associated together (i.e. virtually concatenated). 
    
   In case of multiplication (i.e. using the multiplier transform), 
   the explicit ordered list of all labels that take part in the 
   Final Signal is given. In case of multiplication of virtually 
   concatenated signals, the first set of labels indicates the time-
   slots occupied by the first virtually concatenated signal, the 
   second set of labels indicates the time-slots occupied by the 
   second virtually concatenated signal, and so on. The above 
   representation limits multiplication to remain within a single 
   (component) link. 
    
   The format of the label for SDH and/or SONET TDM-LSR link is: 
 
    0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |               S               |   U   |   K   |   L   |   M   | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   This is an extension of the numbering scheme defined in G.707 
   sections 7.3.7 to 7.3.13, i.e. the (K, L, M) numbering.  Note that 
   the higher order numbering scheme defined in G.707 sections 7.3.1 
   to 7.3.6 is not used here. 
 
   Each letter indicates a possible branch number starting at the 
   parent node in the multiplex structure. Branches are considered as 
   numbered in increasing order, starting from the top of the 
   multiplexing structure. The numbering starts at 1, zero is used to 
   indicate a non-significant or ignored field. 
    
   When a field is not significant or ignored in a particular context 
   it MUST be set to zero when transmitted, and MUST be ignored when 
   received. 
    
   When a hierarchy of SDH/SONET LSPs is used, an LSP with a given 
   bandwidth can be used to carry lower order LSPs.  The higher order 
   SDH/SONET LSP behaves as a "virtual link" with a given bandwidth 
   (e.g. VC-3), it may also be used as a Forwarding Adjacency. A 
   lower order SDH/SONET LSP can be established through that higher 
   order LSP. Since a label is local to a (virtual) link, the highest 
   part of that label is non-significant and is set to zero, i.e. the 
   label is "0,0,0,L,M". Similarly, if the structure of the higher 
   order LSP is unknown or not relevant, the lowest part of that 
   label is non-significant and is set to zero, i.e. the label is 
   "S,U,K,0,0". 
    
   For instance, a VC-3 LSP can be used to carry lower order LSPs. In 
   that case the labels allocated between the two ends of the VC-3 
   LSP for the lower order LSPs will have S, U and K set to zero, 
   i.e., non-significant, while L and M will be used to indicate the 
   signal allocated in that VC-3.

   In case of tunneling such as VC-4 containing VC-3 containing VC-
   12/VC-11 where the SUKLM structure is not adequate to represent 
   the full signal structure, a hierarchical approach must be used, 
   i.e. per layer network signaling. 
 
   The possible values of S, U, K, L and M are defined as follows: 
    
     1. S=1->N is the index of a particular AUG-1/STS-3 inside an 
     STM-N/STS-N multiplex. S is only significant for SDH STM-N (N>0) 
     and SONET STS-N (N>1) and must be 0 and ignored for STM-0 and 
     STS-1. 
    
     2. U=1->3 is the index of a particular VC-3/STS-1 SPE within an 
     AUG-1/STS-3. U is only significant for SDH STM-N (N>0) and SONET 
     STS-N (N>1) and must be 0 and ignored for STM-0 and STS-1. 
 
     3. K=1->3 is the index of a particular TUG-3 within a VC-4. K is 
     only significant for an SDH VC-4 structured in TUG-3s and must 
     be 0 and ignored in all other cases. 
    
     4. L=1->7 is the index of a particular TUG-2/VT Group within a 
     TUG-3, VC-3 or STS-1 SPE. L must be 0 and ignored in all other 
     cases. 
    
     5. M is the index of a particular VC-1/VT-1.5, VT-2 or VT-3 SPE 
     within a TUG-2/VT Group. M=1->2 indicates a specific VT-3 SPE 
     inside the corresponding VT Group, these values MUST NOT be used 
     for SDH since there is no equivalent of VT-3 with SDH. M=3->5 
     indicates a specific VC-12/VT-2 SPE inside the corresponding 
     TUG-2/VT Group. M=6->9 indicates a specific VC-11/VT-1.5 SPE 
     inside the corresponding TUG-2/VT Group. 
      
     Note that a label always has to be interpreted according the 
     SDH/SONET traffic parameters, i.e. a label by itself does not 
     allow knowing which signal is being requested (a label is 
     context sensitive). 
 
     The S encoding is summarized in the following table: 
    
          S    SDH                     SONET

   Example 3: the label for the Uth-1 VC-3/STS-1 SPE within the Sth 
   AUG-1/STS-3 is: S>0, U>0, K=0, L=0, M=0. 
    
   Example 4: the label for the VC-2/VT-6 in the Lth-1 TUG-2/VT Group 
   in the Uth-1 VC-3/STS-1 SPE within the Sth AUG-1/STS-3 is: S>0, 
   U>0, K=0, L>0, M=0. 
    
   Example 5: the label for the 3rd VC-11/VT-1.5 in the Lth-1 TUG-
   2/VT Group within the Uth-1 VC-3/STS-1 SPE within the Sth AUG-
   1/STS-3 is: S>0, U>0, K=0, L>0, M=8. 
 
   Example 6: the label for the VC-4-4c/STS-12c which uses the 9th 
   AUG-1/STS-3 as its first timeslot is: S=9, U=0, K=0, L=0, M=0. 
 
   In case of contiguous concatenation, the label that is used is the 
   lowest label of the contiguously concatenated signal as explained 
   before. The higher part of the label indicates where the signal 
   starts and the lowest part is not significant. 
    
   In case of STM-0/STS-1, the values of S, U and K must be equal to 
   zero according to the field coding rules. For instance, when 
   requesting a VC-3 in an STM-0 the label is S=0, U=0, K=0, L=0, 
   M=0. When requesting a VC-11 in a VC-3 in an STM-0 the label is 
   S=0, U=0, K=0, L>0, M=6..9. 
 
   When a transparent STM-N/STS-3*N (N=1, 4, 16, 64, 256) is 
   requested, the label is not applicable and is set to zero. 
    
   Refer to [GMPLS-SONET-SDH-EXT] for the label for the extended set 
   of transparency types beyond the transparency types as defined in

Appendix 1 - Signal Type Values Extension For VC-3 
    
   This appendix defines the following optional additional Signal 
   Type value for the Signal Type field of section 2.1: 
    
       Value         Type 
       -----  --------------------- 
        20     "VC-3 via AU-3 at the end" 
    
   According to the G.707 standard a VC-3 in the TU-3/TUG-3/VC-4/AU-4 
   branch of the SDH multiplex cannot be structured in TUG-2s, 
   however a VC-3 in the AU-3 branch can be. In addition, a VC-3 
   could be switched between the two branches if required. 
 
   A VC-3 circuit could be terminated on an ingress interface of an 
   LSR (e.g. forming a VC-3 forwarding adjacency). This LSR could 
   then want to demultiplex this VC-3 and switch internal low order 
   LSPs. For implementation reasons, this could be only possible if 
   the LSR receives the VC-3 in the AU-3 branch. E.g. for an LSR not 
   able to switch internally from a TU-3 branch to an AU-3 branch on 
   its incoming interface before demultiplexing and then switching 
   the content with its switch fabric. 
    
   In that case it is useful to indicate that the VC-3 LSP must be 
   terminated at the end in the AU-3 branch instead of the TU-3 
   branch. 
    
   This is achieved by using the "VC-3 via AU-3 at the end" signal 
   type. This information can be used, for instance, by the 
   penultimate LSR to switch an incoming VC-3 received in any branch 
   to the AU-3 branch on the outgoing interface to the destination 
   LSR. 
    
   The "VC-3 via AU-3 at the end" signal type does not imply that the 
   VC-3 must be switched via the AU-3 branch at some other places in 
   the network. The VC-3 signal type just indicates that a VC-3 in 
   any branch is suitable.

Annex 1 - Examples 
    
   This annex defines examples of SONET and SDH signal coding. Their 
   objective is to help the reader to understand how works the traffic 
   parameter coding and not to give examples of typical SONET or SDH 
   signals. 
    
   As stated above, signal types are Elementary Signals to which 
   successive concatenation, multiplication and transparency 
   transforms can be applied. 
    
   1. A VC-4 signal is formed by the application of RCC with value 0, 
   NCC with value 0, NVC with value 0, MT with value 1 and T with 
   value 0 to a VC-4 Elementary Signal. 
    
   2. A VC-4-7v signal is formed by the application of RCC with value 
   0, NCC with value 0, NVC with value 7 (virtual concatenation of 7 
   components), MT with value 1 and T with value 0 to a VC-4 
   Elementary Signal. 
    
   3. A VC-4-16c signal is formed by the application of RCC with flag 
   1 (standard contiguous concatenation), NCC with value 16, NVC with 
   value 0, MT with value 1 and T with value 0 to a VC-4 Elementary 
   Signal. 
    
   4. An STM-16 signal with Multiplex Section layer transparency is 
   formed by the application of RCC with value 0, NCC with value 0, 
   NVC with value 0, MT with value 1 and T with flag 2 to an STM-16 
   Elementary Signal. 
 
   5. An STM-4 signal with Multiplex Section layer transparency is 
   formed by the application of RCC with flag 0, NCC with value 0, 
   NVC with value 0, MT with value 1 and T with flag 2 applied to an 
   STM-4 Elementary Signal. 
    
   6. An STM-256 signal with Multiplex Section layer transparency is 
   formed by the application of RCC with flag 0, NCC with value 0, 
   NVC with value 0, MT with value 1 and T with flag 2 applied to an 
   STM-256 Elementary Signal. 
    
   7. An STS-1 SPE signal is formed by the application of RCC with 
   value 0, NCC with value 0, NVC with value 0, MT with value 1 and T 
   with value 0 to an STS-1 SPE Elementary Signal. 
    
   8. An STS-3c SPE signal is formed by the application of RCC with 
   value 0 (no contiguous concatenation), NCC with value 0, NVC with 
   value 0, MT with value 1 and T with value 0 to an STS-3c SPE 
   Elementary Signal. 
    
   9. An STS-48c SPE signal is formed by the application of RCC with 
   flag 1 (standard contiguous concatenation), NCC with value 16, NVC 
   with value 0, MT with value 1 and T with value 0 to an STS-3c SPE 
   Elementary Signal.

   10. An STS-1-3v SPE signal is formed by the application of RCC 
   with value 0, NVC with value 3 (virtual concatenation of 3 
   components), MT with value 1 and T with value 0 to an STS-1 SPE 
   Elementary Signal. 
    
   11. An STS-3c-9v SPE signal is formed by the application of RCC 
   with value 0, NCC with value 0, NVC with value 9 (virtual 
   concatenation of 9 STS-3c), MT with value 1 and T with value 0 to 
   an STS-3c SPE Elementary Signal. 
    
   12. An STS-12 signal with Section layer (full) transparency is 
   formed by the application of RCC with value 0, NVC with value 0, 
   MT with value 1 and T with flag 1 to an STS-12 Elementary Signal. 
 
   13. 3 x STS-768c SPE signal is formed by the application of RCC 
   with flag 1, NCC with value 256, NVC with value 0, MT with value 
   3, and T with value 0 to an STS-3c SPE Elementary Signal. 
    
   14. 5 x VC-4-13v composed signal is formed by the application of 
   RCC with value 0, NVC with value 13, MT with value 5 and T with 
   value 0 to a VC-4 Elementary Signal. 
    
   The encoding of these examples is summarized in the following 
   table: 
 
   Signal                     ST   RCC   NCC   NVC   MT   T
