              OCB For Block Ciphers Without 128-Bit Blocks
                     draft-krovetz-ocb-wideblock-00

Abstract

   The OCB authenticated-encryption algorithm is specified in RFC 7523,
   but only for blockciphers with 128-bit blocks such as AES.  This
   document extends RFC 7523 by specifying how OCB is used with
   blockciphers of any blocklength.  When the blocklength is 128 bits,
   this specification and that in RFC 7523 are identical.

1.  Introduction

   OCB is a shared-key, blockcipher-based authentication scheme
   specified in [RFC7523].  It was designed with the AES blockcipher in
   mind and thus envisioned only being used with 128-bit blockciphers.
   The resulting RFC 7523 does not allow blockciphers with larger or
   smaller blocklengths.  This document respecifies OCB in a more
   general manner, eliminating the expectation that a 128-bit
   blockcipher is used.  This update is consistent with RFC 7523 and
   does not contradict it in any way.  For applications using 128-bit
   blockciphers, RFC 7523 should be preferred because it is simpler,
   self-contained, and has more applicable test vectors.

   Changing the blocklength used in OCB is not a simple matter.  There
   are non-trivially defined constants used in OCB that must be
   recalculated for each different blocklength.  What follows is largely

   a copy of the algorithms from RFC 7523, made more general by using
   blocklength-dependent symbolic constants.

   The security of OCB continues to follow a birthday bound.  Both the
   confidentiality and the authenticity properties of OCB degrade as per
   s^2 / 2^b, where s is the total number of blocks that the adversary
   acquires and b is the number of bits per blockcipher block.  Note
   that this means security degrades rapidly when using a blockcipher
   with a small to moderate blocklength.

2.  Notation and Basic Operations

   There are two types of variables used in this specification, strings
   and integers.  Although strings processed by most implementations of
   OCB will be strings of bytes, bit-level operations are used
   throughout this specification document for defining OCB.  String
   variables are always written with an initial upper-case letter while
   integer variables are written in all lower-case.  Following C's
   convention, a single equals ("=") indicates variable assignment and
   double equals ("==") is the equality relation.  Whenever a variable
   is followed by an underscore ("_"), the underscore is intended to
   denote a subscript, with the subscripted expression requiring
   evaluation to resolve the meaning of the variable.  For example, when
   i == 2, then P_i refers to the variable P_2.

   c^i           The integer c raised to the i-th power.

   bitlen(S)     The length of string S in bits (eg, bitlen(001) == 3).

   zeros(n)      The string made of n zero-bits.

   ntz(n)        The number of trailing zero bits in the base-2
                 representation of the positive integer n.  More
                 formally, ntz(n) is the largest integer x for which 2^x
                 divides n.

   S xor T       The string that is the bitwise exclusive-or of S and T.
                 Strings S and T will always have the same length.

   S[i]          The i-th bit of the string S (indices begin at 1, so if
                 S is 011 then S[1] == 0, S[2] == 1, S[3] == 1).

   S[i..j]       The substring of S consisting of bits i through j,
                 inclusive.

   S || T        String S concatenated with string T (eg, 000 || 111 ==
                 000111).

   str2num(S)    The base-2 interpretation of bitstring S (eg,
                 str2num(1110) == 14).

   num2str(i,n)  The n-bit string whose base-2 interpretation is i (eg,
                 num2str(14,4) == 1110 and num2str(1,2) == 01).

   double(S)     If S[1] == 0 then double(S) == (S[2..bitlen(S)] || 0);
                 otherwise double(S) == (S[2..bitlen(S)] || 0) xor
                 num2str(RESIDUE,bitlen(S)) where RESIDUE is defined in
                 Section 3.1 or Appendix B.

3.  OCB Global Parameters

   To be complete, the algorithms in this document require specification
   of two global parameters: a blockcipher and the length of
   authentication tags in use.

   Specifying a blockcipher implicitly defines the following symbols.

   BLOCKLEN       The blockcipher's blocklength, in bits.

   KEYLEN         The blockcipher's key length, in bits.

   ENCIPHER(K,P)  The blockcipher function mapping BLOCKLEN-bit
                  plaintext block P to its corresponding ciphertext
                  block using KEYLEN-bit key K.

   DECIPHER(K,C)  The inverse blockcipher function mapping BLOCKLEN-bit
                  ciphertext block C to its corresponding plaintext
                  block using KEYLEN-bit key K.

   The TAGLEN parameter specifies the length of authentication tag used
   by OCB and may be any positive value up to, and including, the
   smaller of BLOCKLEN or 256.

   As an example, if 128-bit authentication tags and AES with 192-bit
   keys are to be used, then BLOCKLEN is 128, KEYLEN is 192, ENCIPHER
   refers to the AES-192 cipher, DECIPHER refers to the AES-192 inverse
   cipher, and TAGLEN is 128.

   Greater values for TAGLEN provide greater assurances of authenticity,
   but ciphertexts produced by OCB are longer than their corresponding
   plaintext by TAGLEN bits.  See Section 5 for details about TAGLEN and
   security.

3.1.  Constants Derived From BLOCKLEN

   Each value of BLOCKLEN gives rise to constants that need careful
   choosing to ensure OCB security and efficiency.  The value RESIDUE is
   used in the definition of double given in Section 2, and the values
   SHIFT, MASKLEN, and TAGREP are used in the OCB-ENCRYPT and OCB-
   DECRYPT functions given in Section 4.

   The following table lists these constants for a collection of
   blockcipher blocklengths.  If a blocklength is needed that is not in
   the table, Appendix B gives the criteria and algorithm used to
   determine the constants given here.  The same criteria and algorithm
   should be used to generate other constants for other blocklengths.

   Note that there are attacks on OCB with success proportional to a
   birthday bound related to BLOCKLEN.  This means that using small
   values of BLOCKLEN may lead quickly to poor security.  See Section 5
   for more information on the security bounds of OCB.

4.  OCB Algorithms

   OCB is described in this section using pseudocode.  Given any
   collection of inputs of the required types, following the pseudocode
   description for a function will produce the correct output of the
   promised type.

4.1.  Associated-Data Processing: HASH

   OCB has the ability to authenticate unencrypted associated data at
   the same time that it provides for authentication and encrypts a
   plaintext.  The following hash function is central to providing this
   functionality.  If an application has no associated data, then the

   associated data should be considered to exist and to be the empty
   string.  HASH, conveniently, always returns zeros(BLOCKLEN) when the
   associated data is the empty string.

4.2.  Encryption: OCB-ENCRYPT

   This function computes a ciphertext (which includes a bundled
   authentication tag) when given a plaintext, associated data, nonce
   and key.  For each invocation of OCB-ENCRYPT using the same key K,
   the value of the nonce input N must be distinct.

4.3.  Decryption: OCB-DECRYPT

   This function computes a plaintext when given a ciphertext,
   associated data, nonce and key.  An authentication tag is embedded in
   the ciphertext.  If the tag is not correct for the ciphertext,
   associated data, nonce and key, then an INVALID signal is produced.

   Function name:
     OCB-DECRYPT
   Input:
     K, string of KEYLEN bits                      // Key
     N, string of up to BLOCKLEN-(TAGREP+1) bits   // Nonce

     C, string of at least TAGLEN bits             // Ciphertext
   Output:
     P, string of length bitlen(C) - TAGLEN bits,  // Plaintext
          or INVALID indicating authentication failure

   P is defined as follows.

5.  Security Considerations

   What follows is a duplicate of the Security Considerations section of
   RFC 7523 with numeric literals replaced by their symbolic
   equivalents.  With the ability to change BLOCKLEN comes two important
   additional considerations.  The amount of data that can safely be
   processed using a single key is related to BLOCKLEN: a larger
   BLOCKLEN allows more data whereas a smaller BLOCKLEN allows less.
   Also, authentication tag lengths are limited to BLOCKLEN bits, which
   means that using OCB with a small BLOCKLEN forces the use of small
   tags.  In all cases, but especially when reducing BLOCKLEN, a careful
   evaluation of an application's security requirements should be
   conducted and only if OCB, with a particular BLOCKLEN, meets those
   requirements should it be used.

   OCB achieves two security properties, confidentiality and
   authenticity.  Confidentiality is defined via "indistinguishability
   from random bits", meaning that an adversary is unable to distinguish
   OCB-outputs from an equal number of random bits.  Authenticity is
   defined via "authenticity of ciphertexts", meaning that an adversary
   is unable to produce any valid nonce-ciphertext pair that it has not
   already acquired.  The security guarantees depend on the underlying
   blockcipher being secure in the sense of a strong pseudorandom
   permutation.  Thus if OCB is used with a blockcipher that is not
   secure as a strong pseudorandom permutation, the security guarantees
   vanish.  The need for the strong pseudorandom permutation property
   means that OCB should be used with a conservatively designed, well-
   trusted blockcipher, such as AES.

   Both the confidentiality and the authenticity properties of OCB
   degrade as per s^2 / 2^BLOCKLEN, where s is the total number of
   blocks that the adversary acquires.  The consequence of this formula
   is that the proven security disappears when s becomes as large as

   2^(BLOCKLEN/2).  Thus the user should never use a key to generate an
   amount of ciphertext that is near to, or exceeds, 2^(BLOCKLEN/2)
   blocks.  In order to ensure that s^2 / 2^BLOCKLEN remains less than
   about 1/2^32, a given key should be used to encrypt at most
   2^(BLOCKLEN/2-16) blocks, including the associated data.  To ensure
   these limits are not crossed, automated key management is recommended
   in systems exchanging large amounts of data [RFC4107].

   When a ciphertext decrypts as INVALID it is the implementor's
   responsibility to make sure that no information beyond this fact is
   made adversarially available.

   OCB encryption and decryption produce an internal BLOCKLEN-bit
   authentication tag.  The parameter TAGLEN determines how many bits of
   this internal tag are included in ciphertexts and used for
   authentication.  The value of TAGLEN has two impacts: An adversary
   can trivially forge with probability 2^{-TAGLEN}, and ciphertexts are
   TAGLEN bits longer than their corresponding plaintexts.  It is up to
   the application designer to choose an appropriate value for TAGLEN.
   Long tags cost no more computationally than short ones.

   Normally, a given key should be used to create ciphertexts with a
   single tag length, TAGLEN, and an application should reject any
   ciphertext that claims authenticity under the same key but a
   different tag length.  While the ciphertext core and all of the bits
   of the tag do depend on the tag length, this is done for added
   robustness against misuse and should not suggest that receivers
   accept ciphertexts employing variable tag lengths under a single key.

   Timing attacks are not a part of the formal security model and an
   implementation should take care to mitigate them in contexts where
   this is a concern.  To render timing attacks impotent, the amount of
   time to encrypt or decrypt a string should be independent of the key
   and the contents of the string.  The only explicitly conditional OCB
   operation that depends on private data is double(), which means that
   using constant-time blockcipher and double() implementations
   eliminates most (if not all) sources of timing attacks on OCB.
   Power-usage attacks are likewise out of scope of the formal model,
   and should be considered for environments where they are threatening.

   The OCB encryption scheme reveals in the ciphertext the length of the
   plaintext.  Sometimes the length of the plaintext is a valuable piece
   of information that should be hidden.  For environments where
   "traffic analysis" is a concern, techniques beyond OCB encryption
   (typically involving padding) would be necessary.

   Defining the ciphertext that results from OCB-ENCRYPT to be the pair
   (C_1 || C_2 || ... || C_m || C_*, Tag[1..TAGLEN]) instead of the

   concatenation C_1 || C_2 || ... || C_m || C_* || Tag[1..TAGLEN]
   introduces no security concerns.  Because TAGLEN is fixed, both
   versions allow ciphertexts to be parsed unambiguously.

5.1.  Nonce Requirements

   It is crucial that, as one encrypts, one does not repeat a nonce.
   The inadvertent reuse of the same nonce by two invocations of the OCB
   encryption operation, with the same key, but with distinct plaintext
   values, undermines the confidentiality of the plaintexts protected in
   those two invocations, and undermines all of the authenticity and
   integrity protection provided by that key.  For this reason, OCB
   should only be used whenever nonce uniqueness can be provided with
   certainty.  Note that it is acceptable to input the same nonce value
   multiple times to the decryption operation.  We emphasize that the
   security consequences are quite serious if an attacker observes two
   ciphertexts that were created using the same nonce and key values,
   unless the plaintext and AD values in both invocations of the encrypt
   operation were identical.  First, a loss of confidentiality ensues
   because the attacker will be able to infer relationships between the
   two plaintext values.  Second, a loss of authenticity ensues because
   the attacker will be able to recover secret information used to
   provide authenticity, making subsequent forgeries trivial.  Note that
   there are AEAD schemes, particularly SIV [RFC5297], appropriate for
   environments where nonces are unavailable or unreliable.  OCB is not
   such a scheme.

   Nonces need not be secret, and a counter may be used for them.  If
   two parties send OCB-encrypted plaintexts to one another using the
   same key, then the space of nonces used by the two parties must be
   partitioned so that no nonce that could be used by one party to
   encrypt could be used by the other to encrypt (eg, odd and even
   counters).

6.  IANA Considerations

   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has defined a registry
   for Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data parameters.  This
   document does not specify any concrete AEAD schemes, so contributes
   nothing to the registry.  Any AEAD scheme based on this document,
   where a permanently registered identifier would be useful, should
   register such identifier with IANA [RFC5116].

Appendix A.  Sample Results

   This section gives sample outputs for various inputs using OCB and
   blockciphers with blocklengths other than 128.  In each case, an
   instance of RC6 is used for the blockcipher [RC6].  The name RC6-w/r/

   b refers to RC6 with a 4w-bit blocklength, r internal rounds, and a
   b-byte key.

   There are too many possible cases to consider for this section to be
   exhaustive.  Instead a small number of examples are shown in detail
   with many significant variable assignments in the pseudocode shown.
   This will help an implementor find most basic errors.  Further
   validation could then be accomplished by comparison with a reference
   implementation over a much more thorough selection of inputs.

   Each of the following entries indicates the blockcipher and tag
   length used followed by the values K, N, A, P, C, indicating that
   plaintext P with associated data A when encrypted using OCB with key
   K, and nonce N, yields ciphertext C (which includes the tag).  All
   strings are represented in hexadecimal (eg, 0F represents the
   bitstring 00001111).  An empty entry indicates the empty string.

A.6.  Example 6: Extended Tests

   The following VALIDATE[B] algorithm tests a wider variety of inputs.
   Parameter B indicates that throughout the validation RC6-(B/4)/16/16
   (ie, RC6 with B-bit blocklength, 16 rounds, and 16-byte keys) is the
   blockcipher used.  Please note that when B is not a power of two,
   then the non-standard version of RC6 documented in [RFCRC6] is used.
   In all cases TAGLEN is min(B, 256).

   Function name:
     VALIDATE[B]
   Output:
     Y, string of length min(B, 256) bits

   Y is defined as follows.

      K = 000102030405060708090A0B0C0D0E0F
      C = <empty string>
      for i = 0 to 127 do
         S = (0x00 || 0x01 || 0x02 || ...)[1..8i]
         N = num2str(3i+1,16)
         C = C || OCB-ENCRYPT(K,N,S,S)
         N = num2str(3i+2,16)
         C = C || OCB-ENCRYPT(K,N,<empty string>,S)
         N = num2str(3i+3,16)
         C = C || OCB-ENCRYPT(K,N,S,<empty string>)
      end for
      N = num2str(385,16)
      Y = OCB-ENCRYPT(K,N,C,<empty string>)

   Iteration i of the loop adds 2i + (3 * TAGLEN / 8) bytes to C,
   resulting in an ultimate length for C of 16256 + 48 * TAGLEN bytes.
   The final OCB-ENCRYPT has an empty plaintext component, so serves
   only to authenticate C.  The output values should be:

Appendix B.  Generating RESIDUE, SHIFT, MASKLEN, TAGREP Constants

   OCB, as defined in [RFC7523] and [OCB], uses several "magic numbers"
   when manipulating 128-bit blocks (135, 8, 6 and 7 for RESIDUE, SHIFT,
   MASKLEN and TAGREP).  These constants are carefully chosen and depend
   on BLOCKLEN.  A table in Section 3.1 gives values for other assorted
   blocklengths and this section describes how to produce the values for
   more blocklengths if needed.

   Finding MASKLEN and SHIFT for a particular BLOCKLEN begins by
   following the process described in Section 4.1 of [OCB].  The result
   of that process is the domain size for every possible shift, 1
   through BLOCKLEN-1, in the stretch-then-shift hash used internally by
   OCB.  With that information, MASKLEN and SHIFT are determined as
   follows.  Define MASKLEN as the floor of the base-2 logarithm of the
   largest domain size found.  Keep as SHIFT candidates all shifts with
   domain sizes of at least 2^MASKLEN.  These all provide equal
   security, but we want a shift that allows efficient implementation
   too.  A shift equal to a large power-of-two would be ideal, but not
   all BLOCKLEN values produce candidate shifts with that property.  Of
   all the shifts with domains of at least 2^MASKLEN, we continue to
   keep as candidates those shift values that are minimal modulo 8 (if
   this minima is equal to zero, then shifts can be performed using byte
   manipulations).  Finally, we prefer shifts that are close to a large
   power-of-two, so of the remaining candidates, we choose for SHIFT one
   whose value modulo 8 and modulo 2^k is equal for the largest k, and
   if more than one has this property we settle on the smallest of those
   that do.  The Sage script at the end of this section makes explicit
   this process and was run using SageMath 7.6 to generate all of the

   MASKLEN and SHIFT values given in Section 3.1 [Sage].  Its list of
   blocklengths can be edited and the script rerun to determine other
   MASKLEN and SHIFT values.

   For the other two constants, TAGREP is defined as min(8, t) where t
   is the smallest integer making 2^t >= BLOCKLEN, and RESIDUE is
   extracted from [Polys].  To determine a RESIDUE for BLOCKLEN, find
   the entry whose largest number is BLOCKLEN and let S be the set of
   numbers other than BLOCKLEN in this entry.  Then, RESIDUE = 1 +
   sum({2^x | x in S}).  For example, when BLOCKLEN is 122 we find the
   entry "122,6,2,1" making S == {6,2,1}. In this case RESIDUE == 1 +
   2^6 + 2^2 + 2^1 == 71.
