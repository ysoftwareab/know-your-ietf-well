Internet-Draft            TWAMP YANG Data Model                July 2018


1.  Introduction

   The Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) [RFC5357] is used to
   measure network performance parameters such as latency, bandwidth,
   and packet loss by sending probe packets and measuring their
   experience in the network.  To date, TWAMP implementations do not
   come with a standard management framework, and, as such, implementers
   have no choice except to provide a proprietary mechanism.  This
   document addresses this gap by defining the model using UML [UML]
   class diagrams, and formally specifying a NMDA-complaint [RFC8342]
   TWAMP data model using YANG 1.1 [RFC7950].

1.1.  Motivation

   In current TWAMP deployments the lack of a standardized data model
   limits the flexibility to dynamically instantiate TWAMP-based
   measurements across equipment from different vendors.  In large,
   virtualized, and dynamically instantiated infrastructures where
   network functions are placed according to orchestration algorithms,
   proprietary mechanisms for managing TWAMP measurements pose severe
   limitations with respect to programmability.

   Two major trends call for standardizing TWAMP management aspects.
   First, it is expected that in the coming years large-scale and multi-
   vendor TWAMP deployments will become the norm.  From an operations
   perspective, using several vendor-specific TWAMP configuration
   mechanisms when one standard mechanism could provide an alternative
   is expensive and inefficient.  Second, the increasingly software-
   defined and virtualized nature of network infrastructures, based on
   dynamic service chains [NSC] and programmable control and management
   planes Software-Defined Networking (SDN): Layers and Architecture
   Terminology [RFC7426] requires a well-defined data model for TWAMP
   implementations.  This document defines such a TWAMP data model and
   specifies it formally using the YANG 1.1 [RFC7950] data modeling
   language.

   Note to RFC Editor:

   Please replace the date 2018-07-02 in Section 5.2 of the draft with
   the date of publication of this draft as a RFC.  Also, replace
   reference to RFC XXXX, and draft-ietf-ippm-port-twamp-test with the
   RFC numbers assigned to the drafts.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP

   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.3.  Document Organization

   The rest of this document is organized as follows.  Section 2
   presents the scope and applicability of this document.  Section 3
   provides a high-level overview of the TWAMP data model.  Section 4
   details the configuration parameters of the data model and Section 5
   specifies in YANG the TWAMP data model.  Section 6 lists illustrative
   examples which conform to the YANG data model specified in this
   document.  Appendix A elaborates these examples further.

2.  Scope, Model, and Applicability

   The purpose of this document is the specification of a vendor-
   independent data model for TWAMP implementations.

   Figure 1 illustrates a redrawn version of the TWAMP logical model
   found in Section 1.2 of TWAMP [RFC5357].  The figure is annotated
   with pointers to the UML [UML] diagrams provided in this document and
   associated with the data model of the four logical entities in a
   TWAMP deployment, namely the TWAMP Control-Client, Server, Session-
   Sender and Session-Reflector.  A UML [UML] Notation Guide is
   available in Section 5 of the said document.

   As per TWAMP [RFC5357], unlabeled links in Figure 1 are left
   unspecified and may be proprietary protocols.

                  Figure 1: Annotated TWAMP logical model

   As per TWAMP [RFC5357], a TWAMP implementation may follow a
   simplified logical model, in which the same node acts both as
   Control-Client and Session-Sender, while another node acts at the
   same time as TWAMP Server and Session-Reflector.  Figure 2
   illustrates this simplified logical model and indicates the

   interaction between the TWAMP configuration client and server using,
   for instance, NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].

              Figure 2: Simplified TWAMP model and protocols

   The data model defined in this document is orthogonal to the specific
   protocol used between the Config client and Config server to
   communicate the TWAMP configuration parameters.

   Operational actions such as how TWAMP-Test sessions are started and
   stopped, how performance measurement results are retrieved, or how
   stored results are cleared, and so on, are not addressed by the
   configuration model defined in this document.  As noted above, such
   operational actions are not part of the TWAMP specification TWAMP
   [RFC5357] and hence are out of scope of this document.  See also
   Appendix B.  In addition, for operational state, current work in
   Registry for Performance Metrics [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry], can
   be used to develop an independent model for the performance metrics
   that need to be captured and retrieved.

3.  Data Model Overview

   The TWAMP data model includes four categories of configuration items.

   First, global configuration items relate to parameters that are set
   on a per device level.  For example, the administrative status of the
   device with respect to whether it allows TWAMP sessions and, if so,
   in what capacity (e.g.  Control-Client, Server or both), is a typical
   instance of a global configuration item.

   A second category includes attributes that can be configured on a per
   TWAMP-Control connection basis, such as the Server IP address.

Internet-Draft            TWAMP YANG Data Model                July 2018


   A third category includes attributes related to per TWAMP-Test
   session attributes, for instance setting different values in the
   Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) field.

   Finally, the data model includes attributes that relate to the
   operational state of the TWAMP implementation.

   As the TWAMP data model is described in the remaining sections of
   this document, readers should keep in mind the functional entity
   grouping illustrated in Figure 1.

3.1.  Control-Client

   A TWAMP Control-Client has an administrative status field set at the
   device level that indicates whether the node is enabled to function
   as such.

   Each TWAMP Control-Client is associated with zero or more TWAMP-
   Control connections.  The main configuration parameters of each
   control connection are:

   o  A name which can be used to uniquely identify at the Control-
      Client a particular control connection.  This name is necessary
      for programmability reasons because at the time of creation of a
      TWAMP-Control connection not all IP and TCP port number
      information needed to uniquely identify the connection is
      available.

   o  The IP address of the interface the Control-Client will use for
      connections.

   o  The IP address of the remote TWAMP Server.

   o  Authentication and encryption attributes such as KeyID, Token and
      the Client Initialization Vector (Client-IV); see also Section 3.1
      in OWAMP [RFC4656] and Randomness Requirements for Security
      [RFC4086].

   Each TWAMP-Control connection, in turn, is associated with zero or
   more TWAMP-Test sessions.  For each test session, the following
   configuration items should be noted:

   o  The test session name uniquely identifies a particular test
      session at the Control-Client and Session-Sender.  Similar to the
      control connections above, this unique test session name is needed
      because at the time of creation of a TWAMP-Test session, for
      example, the source UDP port number is not known to uniquely
      identify the test session.

   o  The IP address and UDP port number of the Session-Sender on the
      path under test by TWAMP.

   o  The IP address and UDP port number of the Session-Reflector on
      said path.

   o  Information pertaining to the test packet stream, such as the test
      starting time, which performance metric is to be used, as defined
      in Registry for Performance Metrics
      [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry], or whether the test should be
      repeated.

3.2.  Server

   Each TWAMP Server has an administrative status field set at the
   device level to indicate whether the node is enabled to function as a
   TWAMP Server.

   Each Server is associated with zero or more TWAMP-Control
   connections.  Each control connection is uniquely identified by the
   4-tuple {Control-Client IP address, Control-Client TCP port number,
   Server IP address, Server TCP port}. Control connection configuration
   items on a TWAMP Server are read-only.

3.3.  Session-Sender

   A TWAMP Session-Sender has an administrative status field set at the
   device level that indicates whether the node is enabled to function
   as such.

   There is one Session-Sender instance for each TWAMP-Test session that
   is initiated from the sending device.  Primary configuration fields
   include:

   o  The test session name MUST be identical to the corresponding test
      session name on the TWAMP Control-Client (Section 3.1).

   o  The control connection name, which along with the test session
      name uniquely identify the TWAMP Session-Sender instance.

   o  Information pertaining to the test packet stream, such as, the
      number of test packets and the packet distribution to be employed;
      see also Network performance measurement with periodic streams
      [RFC3432].

Internet-Draft            TWAMP YANG Data Model                July 2018


3.4.  Session-Reflector

   Each TWAMP Session-Reflector has an administrative status field set
   at the device level to indicate whether the node is enabled to
   function as such.

   Each Session-Reflector is associated with zero or more TWAMP-Test
   sessions.  For each test session, the REFWAIT timeout parameter,
   which determines whether to discontinue the session if no packets
   have been received (TWAMP [RFC5357], Section 4.2), can be configured.

   Read-only access to other data model parameters, such as the Sender
   IP address, is foreseen.  Each test session can be uniquely
   identified by the 4-tuple mentioned in Section 3.2.

4.  Data Model Parameters

   This section defines the TWAMP data model using UML [UML] and
   introduces selected parameters associated with the four TWAMP logical
   entities.  The complete TWAMP data model specification is provided in
   the YANG module presented in Section 5.2.

4.1.  Control-Client

   The client container (see Figure 3) holds items that are related to
   the configuration of the TWAMP Control-Client logical entity (recall
   Figure 1).

   The client container includes an administrative configuration
   parameter (client/admin-state) that indicates whether the device is
   allowed to initiate TWAMP-Control connections.

             Figure 3: TWAMP Control-Client UML class diagram

   The client container holds a list (mode-preference-chain) which
   specifies the Mode values according to their preferred order of use
   by the operator of this Control-Client, including the authentication
   and encryption Modes.  Specifically, mode-preference-chain lists the
   mode and its corresponding priority, as a 16-bit unsigned integer.
   Values for the priority start with zero, the highest priority, and
   decreasing priority value is indicated by every increase in value by
   one.

Internet-Draft            TWAMP YANG Data Model                July 2018


   Depending on the Modes available in the Server Greeting, the Control-
   Client MUST choose the highest priority Mode from the configured
   mode-preference-chain list.

   Note that the list of preferred Modes may set multiple bit positions
   independently, such as when referring to the extended TWAMP features
   in Mixed Security Mode for TWAMP [RFC5618], Individual Session
   Control Feature for TWAMP [RFC5938], TWAMP Reflect Octets and
   Symmetrical Size Features [RFC6038], and IKEv2-Derived Shared Secret
   Key for OWAMP and TWAMP [RFC7717].  If the Control-Client cannot
   determine an acceptable Mode, or when the bit combinations do not
   make sense, e.g., both authenticated and unauthenticated bit are set,
   it MUST respond with zero Mode bits set in the Set-up Response
   message, indicating it will not continue with the control connection.

   In addition, the client container holds a list named key-chain which
   relates key-id with the respective secret-key.  Both the Server and
   the Control-Client use the same mappings from key-id to secret-key
   (in Figure 3); in order for this to work properly, key-id must be
   unique across all systems in the administrative domain.  The Server,
   being prepared to conduct sessions with more than one Control-Client,
   uses key-id to choose the appropriate secret-key; a Control-Client
   would typically have different secret keys for different Servers.
   The secret-key is the shared secret, of type binary and the length
   SHOULD contain at least 128 bits of entropy.  The key-id and secret-
   key encoding SHOULD follow Section 9.8 of YANG [RFC7950].  The
   derived key length (dkLen in PKCS #5: Password-Based Cryptography
   Specification Version 2.1 [RFC8018]) MUST be 16 octets for the AES
   Session-key used for encryption and 32 octets for the HMAC-SHA1
   Session-key used for authentication; see also Section 6.10 of OWAMP
   [RFC4656].

   Each client container also holds a list of control connections, where
   each item in the list describes a TWAMP control connection initiated
   by this Control-Client.  There SHALL be one ctrl-connection per
   TWAMP-Control (TCP) connection that is to be initiated from this
   device.

   In turn, each ctrl-connection holds a test-session-request list.
   Each test-session-request holds information associated with the
   Control-Client for this test session.  This includes information
   associated with the Request-TW-Session/Accept-Session message
   exchange (see Section 3.5 of TWAMP [RFC5357]).

   There SHALL be one instance of test-session-request for each TWAMP-
   Test session that is to be negotiated by this TWAMP-Control
   connection via a Request-TW-Session/Accept-Session exchange.

Internet-Draft            TWAMP YANG Data Model                July 2018


   The Control-Client is also responsible for scheduling TWAMP-Test
   sessions, therefore test-session-request holds information related to
   these actions (e.g. pm-index, repeat-interval).

4.2.  Server

   The server container (see Figure 4) holds items that are related to
   the configuration of the TWAMP Server logical entity (recall
   Figure 1).

   The server container includes an administrative configuration
   parameter (server/admin-state) that indicates whether the device is
   allowed to receive TWAMP-Control connections.

   A device operating in the Server role cannot configure attributes on
   a per TWAMP-Control connection basis, as it has no foreknowledge of
   the incoming TWAMP-Control connections to be received.  Consequently,
   any parameter that the Server might want to apply to an incoming
   control connection must be configured at the overall Server level and
   applied to all incoming TWAMP-Control connections.

                 Figure 4: TWAMP Server UML class diagram

   Each server container holds a list named key-chain which relates key-
   id with the respective secret-key.  As mentioned in Section 4.1, both
   the Server and the Control-Client use the same mapping from key-id to
   shared secret-key; in order for this to work properly, key-id must be
   unique across all the systems in the administrative domain.  The
   Server, being prepared to conduct sessions with more than one
   Control-Client, uses key-id to choose the appropriate secret-key; a
   Control-Client would typically have different secret keys for
   different Servers.  The key-id tells the Server which shared secret-
   key the Control-Client wishes to use for authentication or
   encryption.

   Each incoming control connection active on the Server is represented
   by a ctrl-connection.  There SHALL be one ctrl-connection per
   incoming TWAMP-Control (TCP) connection that is received and active
   on the Server.  Each ctrl-connection can be uniquely identified by
   the 4-tuple {client-ip, client-tcp-port, server-ip, server-tcp-port}.
   All items in the ctrl-connection list are read-only.

   Session-Reflector might want to apply to an incoming TWAMP-Test
   session must be configured at the overall Session-Reflector level and
   are applied to all incoming sessions.

            Figure 6: TWAMP Session-Reflector UML class diagram

   Each incoming TWAMP-Test session that is active on the Session-
   Reflector SHALL be represented by an instance of a test-session
   object.  All items in the test-session object are read-only.

   Instances of test-session are indexed by a session identifier (sid).
   This value is auto-allocated by the TWAMP Server as test session
   requests are received, and communicated back to the Control-Client in
   the SID field of the Accept-Session message; see Section 4.3 of TWAMP
   Reflect Octets and Symmetrical Size Features [RFC6038].

   When attempting to retrieve operational data for active test sessions
   from a Session-Reflector device, the user will not know what sessions
   are currently active on that device, or what SIDs have been auto-
   allocated for these test sessions.  If the user has network access to
   the Control-Client device, then it is possible to read the data for
   this session under client/ctrl-connection/test-session-request/sid
   and obtain the SID (see Figure 3).  The user may then use this SID

   value as an index to retrieve an individual session-reflector/test-
   session instance on the Session-Reflector device.

   If the user has no network access to the Control-Client device, then
   the only option is to retrieve all test-session instances from the
   Session-Reflector device, and then pick out specific test-session
   instances of interest to the user.  This could be problematic if a
   large number of test sessions are currently active on that device.

   Each Session-Reflector TWAMP-Test session contains the following
   4-tuple: {parent-connection-client-ip, parent-connection-client-tcp-
   port, parent-connection-server-ip, parent-connection-server-tcp-
   port}. This 4-tuple MUST correspond to the equivalent 4-tuple
   {client-ip, client-tcp-port, server-ip, server-tcp-port} in server/
   ctrl-connection.  This 4-tuple allows the user to trace back from the
   TWAMP-Test session to the (parent) TWAMP-Control connection that
   negotiated this test session.

5.  Data Model

   This section formally specifies the TWAMP data model using YANG.

5.1.  YANG Tree Diagram

   This section presents a simplified graphical representation of the
   TWAMP data model using a YANG tree diagram.  Readers should keep in
   mind that the limit of 72 characters per line forces us to introduce
   artificial line breaks in some tree diagram nodes.  Tree diagrams
   used in this document follow the notation defined in YANG Tree
   Diagrams [RFC8340].

        model for the Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP).

        The data model covers four TWAMP logical entities, namely,
        Control-Client, Server, Session-Sender, and Session-Reflector,
        as illustrated in the annotated TWAMP logical model (Fig. 1
        of RFC XXXX).

        This YANG module uses features to indicate which of the four
        logical entities are supported by a TWAMP implementation.

            Further, note that according to Section 6 of RFC 5357:

            'If an attacking system sets the maximum value in

            for a significant period of time while it attempts to
            generate keys.

            TWAMP-compliant systems SHOULD have a configuration
            control to limit the maximum count value. The default
            max-count-exponent value SHOULD be 15 which corresponds
            to a maximum value of 2**15 or 32768.'

            RFC 5357 does not qualify 'significant period' in terms of
            time, but it is clear that this depends on the processing
            capacity available and operators need to pay attention to

6.  Data Model Examples

   This section presents a simple but complete example of configuring
   all four entities in Figure 1, based on the YANG module specified in
   Section 5.  The example is illustrative in nature, but aims to be
   self-contained, i.e. were it to be executed in a real TWAMP
   implementation it would lead to a correctly configured test session.
   For completeness, examples are provided for both IPv4 and IPv6.

   A more elaborated example, which also includes authentication
   parameters, is provided in Appendix A.

6.1.  Control-Client

   Figure 8 shows a configuration example for a Control-Client with
   client/admin-state enabled.  In a real implementation following
   Figure 2 this would permit the initiation of TWAMP-Control
   connections and TWAMP-Test sessions.

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
   <config xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
     <twamp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-twamp">
       <client>
         <admin-state>true</admin-state>
       </client>
     </twamp>
   </config>


         Figure 8: XML instance enabling Control-Client operation.

   The following example shows a Control-Client with two instances of
   client/ctrl-connection, one called "RouterA" and another called
   "RouterB".  Each TWAMP-Control connection is to a different Server.
   The control connection named "RouterA" has two test session requests.
   The TWAMP-Control connection named "RouterB" has no TWAMP-Test
   session requests.

7.  Security Considerations

   Virtually all existing measurement systems using TWAMP [RFC5357] are
   administered by the same network operator.  Attacks on the
   measurement infrastructure could be launched by third-parties to
   commandeer the packet generation capability, corrupt the
   measurements, or other examples of nefarious acts.

   The YANG module specified in Section 5 of this document defines a
   schema for data that is designed to be accessed via network
   management protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].
   The lowest NETCONF [RFC6241] layer is the secure transport layer, and
   the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH)
   [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-
   implement secure transport is TLS [RFC5246].

   The NETCONF Access Control Module (NACM) [RFC8341] provides the means
   to restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of nodes defined in this YANG module which are
   writeable.  These data nodes may be considered sensitive and
   vulnerable to attacks in some network environments.  Ability to write
   into these nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect
   on the devices that support this feature.

   If written, the 'admin-state' node can cause unintended test sessions
   to be created.  If the node 'number-of-packets' that dictates how
   many packets are sent in any particular test session is written with

Internet-Draft            TWAMP YANG Data Model                July 2018


   a large value, it can cause a test session to run longer than
   expected.  Nodes that are particularly vulnerable include several
   timeout values put in the protocol to protect against sessions that
   are not active but are consuming resources.  These are the REFWAIT
   timeout parameter which determine whether to discontinue the session
   if no packets are received, and nodes 'count' and 'max-count-
   exponent' which can cause a long time to be spent on PBKDF2
   iterations.  In addition, 'dscp' node marked with different DSCP
   markings, can cause the test traffic on the network to be skewed, and
   the result manipulated.  Finally, nodes within 'mode-preference-
   chain' which specify the 'mode' and 'priority' values and indicate
   the preferred order of use by an operator, can be manipulated to send
   unauthenticated or non-encrypted traffic, enabling a MITM attack.
   Limiting access to these nodes will limit the ability to launch an
   attack in network environments.

   The 'token' node defined in the model, containing a concatenation of
   a Challenge, AES Session-key used for encryption, and HMAC-SHA1
   Session-key used for authentication, is sensitive from a privacy
   perspective, and can be used to disrupt a test session.  The ability
   to read the field should be limited to the administrator of the test
   network.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a URI in the IETF XML registry [RFC3688].
   Following the format in IETF XML Registry [RFC3688], the following
   registration is requested to be made.

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-twamp

   Registrant Contact: The IESG.

   XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers a YANG module in the YANG Module Names
   registry YANG [RFC6020].

   name: ietf-twamp

   namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-twamp

   prefix: twamp

   reference: RFC XXXX

Appendix B.  TWAMP Operational Commands

   TWAMP operational commands could be performed programmatically or
   manually, e.g. using a command-line interface (CLI).

   With respect to programmability, YANG can be used to define NETCONF
   Remote Procedure Calls (RPC), therefore it would be, in principle,
   possible to define TWAMP RPC operations for actions such as starting
   or stopping control connections or test sessions or groups of
   sessions; retrieving results; clearing stored results, and so on.

   However, TWAMP [RFC5357] does not attempt to describe such
   operational actions.  Refer also to Section 2 and the unlabeled links
   in Figure 1.  In actual deployments different TWAMP implementations
   may support different sets of operational commands, with different
   restrictions.  Therefore, this document considers it the
   responsibility of the individual implementation to define its
   corresponding TWAMP operational commands data model.
