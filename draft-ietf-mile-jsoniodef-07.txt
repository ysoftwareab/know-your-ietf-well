Abstract

   RFC7970 specified an information model and a corresponding XML data
   model for exchanging incident and indicator information.  This draft
   provides an alternative data model implementation in CBOR/JSON.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7970] defines a data representation for security incident reports
   and indicators commonly exchanged by operational security teams.  It
   facilitates the automated exchange of this information to enable
   mitigation and watch-and-warning.  Section 3 of [RFC7970] defined an
   information model using Unified Modeling Language (UML) and a
   corresponding Extensible Markup Language (XML) schema data model in
   Section 8.  This UML-based information model and XML-based data model
   are referred to as IODEF UML and IODEF XML, respectively in this
   document.

   This document defines an alternate implementation of the IODEF UML
   information model by specifying a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
   data model using CDDL and JSON Schema [jsonschema].  This JSON data
   model is referred to as IODEF JSON in this document.

   IODEF JSON provides all of the expressivity of IODEF XML.  It gives
   implementers and operators an alternative format to exchange the same
   information.

   The normative IODEF JSON data model is found in Section 5.  Section 2
   and Section 3 describe the data types and elements of this data
   model.  Section 4 provides examples.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  IODEF Data Types

   The abstract IODEF JSON implements the abstract data types specified
   in Section 2 of [RFC7970].

2.1.  Abstract Data Type to JSON Data Type Mapping

   IODEF JSON uses native and derived JSON data types.  Figure 1
   describes the mapping between the abstract data types in Section 2 of
   [RFC7970] and their corresponding implementations in IODEF JSON.

2.2.  Complex JSON Types

2.2.1.  Multilingual Strings

   A string that needs to be represented in a human-readable language
   different from the default encoding of the document is represented in
   the information model by the ML_STRING data type.  This data type is
   implemented as either an object with "value", "lang", and
   "translation-id" elements or a text string as defined in Section 5.
   Examples are shown below.

   "MLStringType": {
     "value": "free-form text",                              //STRING
     "lang": "en",                                             //ENUM
     "translation-id": "jp2en0023"                           //STRING
   }

2.2.2.  Software and Software Reference

   A particular version of software is represented in the information
   model by the SOFTWARE data type.  This software can be described by
   using a reference, a URL, or with free-form text.  The SOFTWARE data
   type is implemented as an object with "SoftwareReference", "URL", and
   "Description" elements as defined in Section 5.  Examples are shown
   below.

   "SoftwareType": {
     "SoftwareReference": {...},          //SoftwareReference
     "Description": ["MS Windows"]        //STRING
   }

   SoftwareReference class is a reference to a particular version of
   software.  Examples are shown below.

   "SoftwareReference": {
     "value": "cpe:/a:google:chrome:59.0.3071.115 ",   //STRING
     "spec-name": "cpe",                                 //ENUM
     "dtype": "string"                                   //ENUM
   }

2.2.3.  Structured Information

   Information provided in a form of structured string, such as ID, or
   structured information, such as XML documents, is represented in the
   information model by the STRUCTUREDINFO data type.  Note that this
   type was originally specified in [RFC7203].  The STRUCTUREDINFO data
   type is implemented as an object with "SpecID", "ext-SpecID",
   "ContentID", "dtype", "RawData", "Reference" elements.  An example
   for embedding a structured ID is shown below.

   "StructuredInfo": {
     "SpecID": "cve",                                          //ENUM
     "ContentID": "CVE-2007-5000"                            //STRING
   }

   When embedding the raw data, base64 conversion should be used for
   encoding the data, as shown below.

   "StructuredInfo": {
     "SpecID": "oval",                                         //ENUM
     "RawData": "<<<strings encoded with base64>>>"            //BYTE
   }

2.2.4.  EXTENSION

   Information not otherwise represented in the IODEF can be added using
   the EXTENSION data type.  This data type is a generic extension
   mechanism.  The EXTENSION data type is implemented as an
   ExtensionType object with "value", "name", "dtype", "ext-dtype",
   "meaning", "formatid", "restriction", "ext-restriction", and
   "observable-id" elements.  An example for embedding a structured ID
   is shown below.

   "ExtensionType": {
     "value": "xxxxxxx",                                      //STRING
     "name": "Syslog",                                        //STRING
     "dtype": "string",                                         //ENUM
     "meaning": "Syslog from the security appliance X"        //STRING
   }

3.2.  Mapping between CBOR/JSON and XML IODEF

   o  This document treats attributes and elements of each class defined
      in [RFC7970] equally and is agnostic on the order of their
      appearances.

   o  Flow class is deleted, and classes with its instances now directly
      have instances of EventData class that used to belong to the Flow
      classs.

   o  ApplicationHeader class is deleted, and classes with its instances
      now directly have instances of ApplicationHeaderField class that
      used to belong to the ApplicationHeader class.

   o  SignatureData class is deleted, and classes with its instances now
      directly have instance of Signature class that used to belong to
      the SignatureData class.

   o  IndicatorData class is deleted, and classes with its instances now
      directly have the instances of Indicator class that used to belong
      to the IndicatorData class.

   o  ObservableReference class is deleted, and classes with its
      instances now directly have uid-ref as an element.

   o  Record class is replaced by RecordData class, and RecordData class
      is renamed to Record class.

   o  Record class is deleted, and classes with its instances now
      directly have the instances of RecordData class that used to
      belong to the Record class.

   o  The MLStringType were modified to support simple string by
      allowing the type to have not only a predefined object type but

      also text type, in order to allow simple descriptions of elements
      of the type.

   o  The elements of ML_STRING type in XML IODEF document are presented
      as either STRING type or ML_STRING type in CBOR/JSON IODEF
      document.

   o  Data models of the extension classes defined by [RFC7203] and
      referenced by [RFC7970] are represented by StructuredInfo class
      defined in this document.

   o  Signature, X509Data, and RawData are encoded with base64 and are
      reprensetend as string (BYTE type) in CBOR/JSON IODEF documents.

4.  Examples

   This section provides examples of IODEF documents.  These examples do
   not represent the full capabilities of the data model or the only way
   to encode particular information.

4.1.  Minimal Example

   A document containing only the mandatory elements and attributes is
   shown below in JSON and CBOR, respectively.

     "version": "2.0",
     "lang": "en",
     "Incident": [{
         "purpose": "reporting",
