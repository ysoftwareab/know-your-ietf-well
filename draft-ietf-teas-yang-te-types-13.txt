1.  Introduction

   YANG [RFC6020] and [RFC7950] is a data modeling language used to
   model configuration data, state data, Remote Procedure Calls, and
   notifications for network management protocols such as NETCONF
   [RFC6241].  The YANG language supports a small set of built-in data
   types and provides mechanisms to derive other types from the built-in
   types.

   This document introduces a collection of common data types derived
   from the built-in YANG data types.  The derived types and groupings
   are designed to be the common types applicable for modeling Traffic
   Engineering (TE) features in model(s) defined outside of this
   document.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP

3.  Overview

   This document defines two YANG modules for common TE types: ietf-te-
   types for TE generic types and ietf-te-packet-types for packet-
   specific types.  Other technology-specific TE types are outside the
   scope of this document.

3.1.  TE Types Module Contents

   The ietf-te-types module contains common TE types that are
   independent and agnostic of any specific technology or control plane
   instance.

   The ietf-te-types module contains the following YANG reusable types
   and groupings:

   te-bandwidth:

      A YANG grouping that defines the generic TE bandwidth.  The
      modeling structure allows augmentation for each technology.  For
      un-specified technologies, the string encoded te-bandwidth type is
      used.

   te-label:

      A YANG grouping that defines the generic TE label.  The modeling
      structure allows augmentation for each technology.  For un-
      specified technologies, rt-types:generalized-label is used.

   performance-metrics-attributes:

      A YANG grouping that defines one-way and two-way measured
      performance metrics and anomalous indication on link(s) or the
      path as defined in [RFC7471], [RFC8570], and [RFC7823].

   performance-metrics-throttle-container:

      A YANG grouping that defines configurable thresholds for
      advertisement suppression and measurement intervals.

Internet-Draft            TE Common YANG Types             November 2019


   te-ds-class:

      A type representing the Differentiated-Services (DS) Class-Type of
      traffic as defined in [RFC4124].

   te-label-direction:

      An enumerated type for specifying the forward or reverse direction
      of a label.

   te-hop-type:

      An enumerated type for specifying hop as loose or strict.

   te-global-id:

      A type representing the identifier that uniquely identify an
      operator, which can be either a provider or a client.  The
      definition of this type is taken from [RFC6370] and [RFC5003].
      This attribute type is used solely to provide a globally unique
      context for TE topologies.

   te-node-id:

      A type representing the identifier for a node in a TE topology.
      The identifier is represented as 4 octets in dotted-quad notation.
      This attribute MAY be mapped to the Router Address described in
      Section 2.4.1 of [RFC3630], the TE Router ID described in
      Section 3 of [RFC6827], the Traffic Engineering Router ID
      described in Section 4.3 of [RFC5305], or the TE Router ID
      described in Section 3.2.1 of [RFC6119].  The reachability of such
      a TE node MAY be achieved by a mechanism such as Section 6.2 of
      [RFC6827].

   te-topology-id:

      A type representing the identifier for a topology.  It is optional
      to have one or more prefixes at the beginning, separated by
      colons.  The prefixes can be the network-types, defined in ietf-
      network [RFC8345], to help user to understand the topology better
      before further inquiry.

   te-tp-id:

      A type representing the identifier of a TE interface link
      termination endpoint (TP) on a specific TE node where the TE link
      connects.  This attribute is mapped to local or remote link
      identifier in [RFC3630] and [RFC5305].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the following URIs in the IETF XML registry
   [RFC3688].  Following the format in [RFC3688], the following
   registration is requested to be made.

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-te-types XML: N/A, the
   requested URI is an XML namespace.

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-te-packet-types XML: N/A, the
   requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers two YANG modules in the YANG Module Names
   registry [RFC6020].

   name: ietf-te-types namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-te-
   types prefix: ietf-te-types reference: RFCXXXX

   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-te-packet-types prefix: ietf-te-
   packet-types reference: RFCXXXX

7.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   The YANG module in this document defines common TE type definitions
   (i.e., typedef, identity and grouping statements) in YANG data
   modeling language to be imported and used by other TE modules.  When
   imported and used, the resultant schema will have data nodes that can
   be writable, or readable.  The access to such data nodes may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
   Write operations (e.g., edit-config) to these data nodes without
   proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

   The security considerations spelled out in the YANG 1.1 specification
   [RFC7950] apply for this document as well.

   design team who are involved in the definition of these data types.

   The authors would also like to thank Tom Petch, Jan Lindblad, Sergio
   Belotti, Italo Busi, Carlo Perocchio, Francesco Lazzeri, and Aihua
   Guo for their review comments and for providing valuable feedback on
