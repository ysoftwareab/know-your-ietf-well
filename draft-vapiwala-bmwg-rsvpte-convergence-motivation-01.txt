        MPLS traffic engineering enables service providers achieve efficient 
        utilization  of  available  network  resources  including  available

     Internet-Draft       Motivation for Benchmarking              March-2007

        bandwidth without adding additional resources in proportional to the 
        increased  demand.  In  addition  MPLS  TE  helps  improve  QoS  and 
        resiliency against unplanned node or link failures in the network. 
        This in essence allows network operators to offer strict service 
        level agreements (SLAs) to consumers. This high-availability and 
        faster recovery capabilities of MPLS TE many network operators have 
        already or are in process of migrating all their services (i.e. 
        voice, data, video, and wireless) over IP/MPLS based network. It is 
        important as the network size grows, the MPLS TE enabled label 
        switched paths (or tunnels) is able to scale to thousands of LSPs 
        and converge the routes bound to the tunnels while keeping memory 
        and CPU resource utilization to a minimal value. This further 
        ensures that how fast TE tunnels convergence assist in recovery of 
        services bound to the tunnels in short interval. 

        As MPLS TE becomes more widely accepted as the primary protocol for 
        network core, the need for common benchmarking of its performance 
        and scalability is of great importance. In this motivational draft, 
        we elaborate on the key performance and scalability metrics that one 
        need to consider for designing MPLS traffic engineering network. 

         

        2. Existing definitions  

      
        For the sake of clarity and continuity this RFC adopts the template 
        or definitions set out in Section 2 of RFC 1242.  Definitions are 
        indexed and grouped together in sections for ease of reference. The 
        key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
        this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.The 
        reader is encouraged to be familiar with the commonly used BFD 
        terms, some of which are defined in the appendix.   
         

        3. Factors impacting MPLS TE Scalability and Performance 

         

         3.1. RSVP Refresh reduction 

              RSVP refresh reduction consists of reliable, summary and bundle

              messages to reduce the number of messages exchanged between the  

              nodes. 

      

         3.2. RSVP Authentication 

              Authentication is used for security purpose and has impact on    

              the scalability and convergence performance of MPLS traffic  

              engineering. 

      

         3.3. RSVP Rate-limit parameter  

              Rate limiting is used by the vendors to pace the RSVP messages  

              on the output queue. Rate limiting is also a key factor in MPLS  

              TE scalability and performance. 

         

         3.4. CPU utilization at the time of signaling 

              CPU Utilization of the DUT at the time of signaling is a key  

              factor that one need to consider when designing the network. 

      

         3.5. CPU Utilization at steady state 

              CPU Utilization of the DUT at steady state is also a key      

              factor in designing the network. 

      

         3.6. Memory Usage 

              Memory usage of the DUT is important to identify in a scale
