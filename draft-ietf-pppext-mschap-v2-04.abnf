M=<msg>"

   where

      The "eeeeeeeeee" is the ASCII representation of a decimal error
      code (need not be 10 digits) corresponding to one of those listed
      below, though implementations should deal with codes not on this
      list gracefully.

         646 ERROR_RESTRICTED_LOGON_HOURS
         647 ERROR_ACCT_DISABLED
         648 ERROR_PASSWD_EXPIRED
         649 ERROR_NO_DIALIN_PERMISSION
         691 ERROR_AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE
         709 ERROR_CHANGING_PASSWORD

      The "r" is an ASCII flag set to '1' if a retry is allowed, and '0'
      if not.  When the authenticator sets this flag to '1' it disables
      short timeouts, expecting the peer to prompt the user for new
      credentials and resubmit the response.

      The "cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc" is the ASCII representation
      of a hexadecimal challenge value.  This field MUST be exactly 32
      octets long and MUST be present.
      The "vvvvvvvvvv" is the ASCII representation of a decimal version
      code (need not be 10 digits) indicating the password changing
      protocol version supported on the server.  For MS-CHAP-V2, this
      value SHOULD always be 3.

      <msg> is human-readable text in the appropriate charset and
      language [12].

PwSize = lstrlenW( Password ) * sizeof( unicode-char )
PwOffset = sizeof( ClearPwBlock.Password ) - PwSize
