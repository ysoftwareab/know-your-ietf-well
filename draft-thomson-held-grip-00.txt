1.  Introduction

   A Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) provides a signal that
   enables accurate determination of the position of a receiver in space
   and time.  A constellation of satellites transmit radio signals that
   the receiver is able to measure.  From these measurements, the
   location of the receiver and the time of measurement can be
   determined using knowledge about the position and velocity of the
   satellites and signal information.

   Acquisition of satellite signals requires searching for the extremely
   weak signal transmitted by each satellite.  Each satellite transmits
   a repeating signal.  Acquiring the signal is done by synchronizing
   with the received signal in both frequency and time.  In order to
   synchronize, the receiver searches in two dimensions:

   time/code phase:  The distance between the satellite and receiver
      means that the receiver sees a signal that is offset in time.  The
      amount of time shift is known as code phase since it is measured
      within the window of the repeated code sequence.  Code phase forms
      the primary measurement used in calculating a position.

   frequency:  The relative speed of satellite and receiver causes
      Doppler shift of the satellite signal.

   Satellite signals are typically modulated at a low rate with a
   navigation message.  The navigation message provides information that
   is used in the final calculation phase including information on
   satellite orbit, satellite health, time model, atmospheric effects on
   the signal.  This data is transmitted at very low rates to avoid
   hampering the acquisition process, therefore acquiring this
   information can take a signficant amount of time.

   Once satellite signals have been acquired and measured, the
   measurement information is combined with the information from the
   navigation message and a position (and time) can be calculated.
   Successful calculation of a position typically requires measurement
   data for a minimum of 5 satellites unless otherwise supplemented.

   If a receiver has to perform all these steps independently, satellite
   acquisition and receipt of the navigation message can take
   significant amounts of time.  Improvements in receiver design have
   increased receiver sensitivity and the speed that signals are
   acquired.  Use of assistance data provides a dramatic improvement in
   the time taken to acquire signals and produce a result.

   This document provides a means of combining a request for GNSS
   assistance data with a HELD [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery]

   request.

1.1.  Advantages of Assistance Data

   GNSS assistance data is information provided to a receiver that is
   provided to improve the quality and timeliness of GNSS measurements
   or positioning.  The most basic set of assistance data includes the
   same information provided in the navigation message.  Additional
   forms of assistance data include information customized to a
   particular receiver to assist it in acquiring signals, or information
   about satellite ephemerides (orbits) that is useful over a longer
   period of time.

   Acquiring assistance data from the network completely removes the
   need to receive the navigation message.  Navigation message content
   can be transmitted to the receiver using the vastly more efficient
   communication paths provided by a data network.  This removes a
   significant step from the process of determining a position.

   Knowing what satellites to search for can reduce signal acquisition
   time.  One of the most basic pieces of information provided by
   assistance data is knowledge of which satellites are above the
   horizon and can therefore be measured.  Concentrating on "visible"
   satellites ensures that less time is wasted where signals could not
   possibly be found.

   Assistance data can provide information about where in the frequency/
   code phase space to search for a particular satellite signal.  This
   reduces the time required to acquire a satellite signal.  Since an
   approximate frequency and code phase can be known, it becomes
   feasible to spend more time searching for weaker signals, improving
   receiver sensitivity.  Improved sensitivity ensures that GNSS can be
   used in areas where signal penetration is poor, like buildings and
   other areas with poor sky visibility, and increases the likelihood of
   getting sufficient satellite measurements to calculate a position.

   Assistance data also enables compensation for the effects of the
   navigation message.  Knowing the content of the navigation message
   ahead of time means that the receiver is able to anticipate the
   effect of its modulation on the signal and compensate accordingly.
   This increases the sensitivity of the receiver and allows for faster
   signal acquisition.

3.  The GNSS Reference Information Protocol

   The GNSS Reference Information Protocol (GRIP) is a protocol that is
   used for the acquisition of GNSS assistance data.  This document
   describes how to use GRIP in conjunction with HELD to enable the use
   of assisted GNSS positioning.

   GRIP response message provides a set of several different types of
   assistance data.  A set of assistance data types for GPS is shown in
   Table 1.  The scope of each field is also included to shown whether
   the data applies globally, to a specific area only (local), or could
   apply to either.

   +-----------------+--------+----------------------------------------+

                  Table 1: Assistance Data Types for GPS

   Data marked as either global or specific to a particular location
   contains information about individual satellites.  This information
   is localized by constraining the information to the set of satellites
   that are expected to be visible from that location.  Information on
   satellites that are on the other side of the Earth or below the
   horizon is omitted.  This ensures that a receiver is immediately able
   to restrict the set of satellites that it searches for.

   Acquisition assistance and differential GPS corrections always
   contain localized information.  Acquisition assistance contains a
   prediction about the satellite signal for the given location that
   narrows the size of the code phase and frequency space that needs to

Internet-Draft             A-GNSS AD for HELD                  June 2008


   be searched.  Differential GPS is information on signal errors
   provided by another receiver that is near the specified location.
   Differential GPS corrections aids in the calculation of results by
   providing fine tuning of the measurement data.

   A GRIP request can include two parts, a request for global assistance
   data and a request for localized assistance data.  Each part
   identifies the assistance data types that are required; a request for
   localized data must also include location information.  Location
   information can be provided by-value or by-reference.

   Note:  GRIP, as reproduced in this document, is an incomplete
      protocol that has the goal of providing a means for requesting
      assistance data.  Only the Global Position System (GPS)
      constellation is supported in the messages that are included in
      this document.  This protocol does not fall within the scope of
      the work performed by the target working group (GEOPRIV) and the
      IETF in general.  It is intended that this work find a more
      appropriate home before this draft progresses.  The information is
      included as a temporary measure to ensure that it can be reliably
      referenced from this document.

4.  Operation

   A Device that includes a GNSS receiver is able to request assistance
   data as part of a HELD location request to a Location Information
   Server (LIS).  The request is included as an extension to the
   location request and is ignored by a LIS that does not support this
   specification, or cannot provide assistance data.  The receiver
   includes a GRIP assistance data request in a HELD location request.

     <locationRequest xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held">
       <adRequest xmlns="urn:x-grip:ns"
                  xmlns:gps="urn:x-grip:gnss:gps">
         <global data="gps:utc gps:ionosphere gps:rti"/>
         <local data="gps:navigation gps:acqassist gps:towassist">
           <locationURI>
             urn:x-grip:location:requester
           </locationURI>
         </local>
       </adRequest>
     </locationRequest>

   The assistance data request contains two parts, identifying the
   global and local assistance data types that are requested.  Global
   assistance data can be provided without any extra information, but
   localized assistance data requires that a location estimate for the
   requester be known.  Any request for localized assistance data must



Thomson & Winterbottom  Expires December 18, 2008               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft             A-GNSS AD for HELD                  June 2008


   include location information.  Location information can be provided
   by value, preferably using a geodetic form, or by reference.

   GRIP requires location information when localized assistance data is
   requested because a GRIP server cannot be assumed to have the ability
   to locate requesters.  However, in the case where the GRIP request is
   placed in a HELD request, the LIS is certainly able to locate the
   requester.  To indicate that the LIS should generate the location
   information necessary to generate localized assistance data a special
   URN is used in place of the location reference.  The
   "urn:x-grip:location:requester" URN indicates that the server is
   expected to generate location information for the requester and use
   that in generating localized assistance data.  The LIS MAY choose to
   generate location information for any request and ignore the location
   information provided.

   The location response, along with the location information, includes
   the requested assistance data.  (Note: the "hexBinary" navigation
   data is wrapped due to document constraints.)

   The response includes the information that was available to the LIS.
   Unsupported or unavailable pieces of information are indicated using
   the "unsupported" or "unavailable" attributes.

4.1.  Assistance Data Types

   Each assistance data type is specified as an XML element that is
   included in either the "global" or "local" element of the assistance
   data response.  Assistance data formats for each different GNSS are
   specified as separate elements.

   A set of assistance data types are defined for GPS in Section 5 using
   the namespace "urn:x-grip:gnss:gps".



Thomson & Winterbottom  Expires December 18, 2008               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft             A-GNSS AD for HELD                  June 2008


   Note:  Different satellite systems share a number of key parameters,
      and it could be useful to have a generic format for assistance
      data that could be universally applicable.  While the benefits of
      a generic approach are obvious, this approach enables a more rapid
      development of a specification without preventing a generic format
      from being introduced later.

4.2.  Identifying Assistance Data Types

   A request for assistance data identifies the XML elements that
   contain the assistance data by name.  The "data" attribute can be
   included on either the "global" or "local" element of the assistance
   data request.  The "data" attribute includes a whitespace-separated
   list of elements.

   Each item in this list is a qualified element name that identifies
   the requested element.  Each item can be interpreted as XML Path
   Language (XPath) [W3C.REC-xpath20-20070123] expressions that are
   evaluated in the context of the matching element in the response.
   These statements are restricted to use of qualified names only.
   Namespace prefixes are taken from the document context.

   Each type of assistance data that is identified in the request must
   be included in the corresponding "global" or "local" element of the
   response.  If information cannot be provided the LIS must indicate
   which items are either unavailable (a temporary cause of error) or
   unsupported (a situation that is more likely to be persistent).  The
   "unavailable" and "unsupported" attributes are used in the response
   to indicate which items were not provided.  Unsupported assistance
   data types must be included in the response using the "unsupported"
   attribute.

   If an assistance data type is requested in an inapplicable category
   (such as the UTC model in the "local" element), it must be reported
   as "unsupported".

   This method of identifying assistance data types enables easy
   extension to forms of GNSS other than GPS or new types of assistance
   data.  By relying on the inherent extensibility provided by
   namespaces in XML [W3C.REC-xml-names-20060816], extensions can be
   readily addded.  Extensions for other types of GNSS or assistance
   data need only define elements in a new namespace.

4.3.  Time Assistance

   Time synchronization is helpful in ensuring rapid signal acquisition.
   Satellite signals change with time, so having accurate time ensures
   that the time-based information provided with assistance data can be



Thomson & Winterbottom  Expires December 18, 2008               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft             A-GNSS AD for HELD                  June 2008


   more effectively used.  Accurate time also enables position
   determination with fewer pseudorange measurements.

   Other assistance data protocols define a reference time assistance
   data type, which includes a time in the GNSS time system.  However,
   the mechanisms that are used to ensure that this information is
   correct when received are dependent on the type of network.  Without
   these mechanisms, network latency and retransmission delays can
   result in this value being incorrect when it is received.

   This document does not define a mechanism for providing accurate time
   as part of assistance data, instead relying on general purpose time
   synchronization protocols.

   The Network Time Protocol (NTP) [RFC1305] or Simple Network Time
   Protocol (SNTP) [RFC4330] can be used by GNSS receivers to acquire
   clock synchronization with Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).  The
   time model assistance data type (or UTC model for GPS) provides the
   information necessary to translate from UTC to the time system used
   by the GNSS.

   A LIS does not provide information about time servers.  Configuration
   of hosts can be manual, or time server information can be provided by
   DHCP ([RFC2132], [RFC3315], [RFC4075], [I-D.gayraud-dhcpv6-ntp-opt]).

5.  GPS Assistance Data Types

   This section defines a set of assistance data types for the GPS GNSS
   (as shown in Table 1).  Each assistance data type is defined as an
   XML element and is able to be identified by the qualified name
   [W3C.REC-xml-names-20060816] of the element.  The GPS elements are
   defined in the "urn:x-grip:gnss:gps" namespace.  The "gps:" prefix is
   used in this section to identify this namespace.

   GPS assistance data is constructed based on the definition of the
   navigation message defined in GPS interface control document
   [GPS-ICD].  Assistance data that is provided on a per-satellite, or
   space vehicle (SV), basis is split into "gps:sat" elements under each
   data type.  The satellite is identified by its SV-ID, a number
   between 1 and 32, in the "num" attribute.

   An XML Schema for GRIP messages is included in Appendix A.  A schema
   defining the format of assistance data for GPS is included in

5.1.  UTC Model

   The UTC model contains the information necessary to convert from UTC
   time to the time system used by GPS.  The "gps:utc" element contains
   a string of hexadecimal digits that correspond to bits 151 through
   279 of subframe 4, page 18 of the navigation message, with the parity
   bits removed.

5.2.  Ionosphere Model

   The ionosphere model contains parameters for a model of the
   propagation delay through the ionosphere - the part of the Earth's
   atmosphere that has the more significant impact on satellite signals.
   The "gps:ionosphere" element contains a string of hexadecimal digits
   that correspond to bits 69 through 145 of subframe 4, page 18 of the
   navigation message, with the parity bits removed.

5.3.  Almanac

   The almanac assistance data type includes information about the
   satellites in the GPS constellation.  This information is intended to
   be long-lived and changes rarely.  This information is not useful for
   calculating a position, but is helpful in determining what satellites
   could be used.  The "gps:almanac" element contains per-satellite
   data.  The content of the "gps:sat" element is a string of
   hexadecimal digits that correspond to the collated almanac data from
   the navigation message (subframe 5, pages 1 through 24; or subframe
   4, pages 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10).

5.4.  Real Time Integrity

   This data type contains a list of the satellite (SV) identifiers for
   those satellites that are either out of service or are otherwise not
   recommended for use.  The "gps:rti" element contains a whitespace-
   separated list of satellited identifiers.

5.5.  Navigation Model

   The navigation model contains information for each satellite in the
   chosen set; either all GPS satellites, or those that are expected to
   be visible from the estimated location of the Device.  To that end,
   the "gps:navigation" element contains one or more "gps:sat" elements.
   The content of the "gps:sat" element is a hex string of 180
   characters (90 bytes) that is sub-frames 1 through 3 of the
   navigation message for the given satellite with parity bits removed.

5.5.1.  Issue of Data Ephemeris

   [[Editor's Note: Using IODE to save on bits is a practice that comes
   over from the original bit-miserly protocols like RRLP that provided
   GPS assistance data.  The complexity of implementing this
   functionality probably outweighs the relatively small saving in bits.
   Candidate for removal.]]

   The navigation model represents the largest and most significant
   piece of assistance data provided.  This information changes on an
   hourly basis, and at each change the Issue of Data Ephemeris (IODE)
   is changed.  For this reason, a request that asks for the navigation
   model is able to indicate the IODE for each satellite and the time
   that this data was acquired.  The response can omit satellites with
   matching IODE.

   An "gps:iode" element can be included in the "local" or "global"
   element of the request.  It identifies the current time (in UTC or
   GPS time) and the IODE for each satellite that the receiver knows
   about.

         </local>

     </locationRequest>

   Implementation of this feature by a GRIP server is optional.  A GRIP
   client that uses this option must be prepared to receive navigation
   model information for satellites that it already has information for.

5.6.  Time of Week Assistance

   The time of week (TOW) assistance information includes the telemetry
   (TLM) message, which is included every six seconds as the first word
   of a subframe or page.  The anti-spoof and alert flags from the
   handover (HOW) word are also included in this item.  This item can
   change each time, but it rarely does; therefore, knowing the current
   telemetry word aids in ensuring that the signal can be more rapidly
   acquired.  The "gps:towassist" element contains per-satellite data.
   The data for each satellite is a whitespace-separated list of four
   integers, starting with the 14-bits of the TLM message, then the
   1-bit anti-spoof flag, the 1-bit alert flag and then the 2-bit
   reserved portion from the TLM word.

5.7.  Acquisition Assistance

   Acquisition assistance aids receivers in satellite signal acquisition
   by attempting to predict signals for a particular location at a
   certain time.  Acquisition assistance is synthesized from satellite
   data; it is not a reconstruction of parts of the navigation message.
   This data includes prediced code phase and doppler, plus a means to
   predict how these change over time.  This compact form allows for
   faster measurement of the signals without necessarily enabling
   position calculation.

   The "gps:acqassist" element contains per-satellite data.  Each
   "gps:sat" element contains a list of floating point numbers as
   described in Table 2.

5.8.  Differential GPS Corrections

   Differential GPS provides a means of compensating for atmospheric
   effects, orbital model limitation and satellite clock drift.  The
   "gps:dgps" element includes attributes that indicate the GPS time
   when measurements were taken and per-satellite information.  The
   "gpsWeek" and "gpsTOW" attributes used for the IODE time are used to
   provide a GPS time on the "gps:dgps" element.

   The "gps:sat" element includes a whitespace-separated list of three
   floating point values:

   UDRE:  an estimate of the accuracy of the pseudorange corrections in
      metres

   pseudorange correction:  a correction value in metres, taken at the
      time indicated

   pseudorange correction rate of change:  the rate that the pseudorange
      correction changes in metres per second

6.  Security Considerations

   Since this document relies on bundling assistance data with a HELD
   location response, it inherits many of the same security
   considerations as HELD [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery].  It
   also inherits all the protections provided therein; largely provided
   by use of TLS [RFC4346].

   Privacy is a major consideration for location protocol security.
   However, assistance data contains less useful information than the
   location information that is already provided.  The bulk of the
   assistance data is either publically available or is derived from
   that publically available data and the estimate location of the
   Device.

   Requesting localized assistance data from a GRIP server for an
   arbitrary location provides little additional information over what
   is provided by requesting global types.  However, a request for
   acquisition assistance could be used to trivially generate spoofed
   GNSS measurements.  [I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-measurements] provides
   suggestions for dealing with spoofed GNSS measurements, but it is

   recommended that a LIS not provide acquisition assistance for
   arbitrary locations.

   A Device that relies on assistance data could find that bad
   assistance data is more of a hindrance than help.  However, the
   impact of an attack by a LIS on assisted GNSS is limited by the fact
   that bad assistance data can be readily ignored and autonomous
   operation used.

7.  IANA Considerations

   No registrations are necessary for GRIP namespaces (these are not
   registered by this document).

8.  Acknowledgements

   This document uses a modified copy of the GRIP protocol based on the
   work done by the University of New South Wales through the OSGRS
   project <http://osgrs.sourceforge.net/>.  Authors of the original
   GRIP specification were Nam Hoang and Manosh Fernando.  The GPS
   expertise of Neil Harper was invaluable in assembling this document.
