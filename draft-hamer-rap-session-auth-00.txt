Abstract  
    
   Establishing multimedia streams must take into account requirements 
   for end-to-end QoS, authorization of network resource usage and 
   accurate accounting for resources used. During session set up, 
   policies may be enforced to ensure that the media streams being 
   requested lie within the bounds of the service profile established 
   for the requesting host. Similarly, when a host requests resources 
   to provide a certain QoS for a packet flow, policies may be enforced 
   to ensure that the required resources lie within the bounds of the 
   resource profile established for the requesting host. 
    
   To prevent fraud and to ensure accurate billing, we describe various 
   scenarios and mechanisms that provide the linkage required to verify 
   that the resources being used to provide a requested QoS are in-line 
   with the media streams requested (and authorized) for the session.

         Framework for session set-up with media authorization 
 
1. Introduction  
    
   Establishing multimedia streams must take into account requirements 
   for end-to-end QoS, authorization of network resource usage and 
   accurate accounting for resources used. During session set up, 
   policies may be enforced to ensure that the media streams being 
   requested lie within the bounds of the service profile established 
   for the requesting host. Similarly, when a host requests resources 
   to provide a certain QoS for a packet flow, policies may be enforced 
   to ensure that the required resources lie within the bounds of the 
   resource profile established for the requesting host. 
    
   Reference [5] defines a mechanism through which end hosts can use a 
   session control protocol (SIP) to indicate that QoS requirements 
   must be met in order to successfully set up a session. However, a 
   separate protocol (e.g. RSVP) is used to request the resources 
   required to meet the end-to-end QoS of the media stream. To prevent 
   fraud and to ensure accurate billing, some linkage is required to 
   verify that the resources being used to provide the requested QoS 
   are in-line with the media streams requested (and authorized) for 
   the session. 
    
   This document describes such a linkage through use of a "token" that 
   provides capabilities similar to that of a gate in [8] and of a 
   ticket in the push model of [2]. The token is generated by a policy 
   server (or a session manager) and is transparently relayed through 
   the end host to the edge router where it is used as part of the 
   policy-controlled flow admission process. 
    
   In some environments, authorization of media streams can exploit the 
   fact that pre-established relationships exist between elements of 
   the network (e.g. session managers, edge routers, policy servers and 
   end hosts). In other environments, however, such pre-established 
   relationships may not exist either due to the complexity of creating 
   these associations a priori (e.g. in a network with many elements), 
   or due to the different business entities involved (e.g. service 
   provider and access provider), or due to the dynamic nature of these 
   associations (e.g. in a mobile environment). 
    
   In this document, we describe these various scenarios and the 
   mechanisms used for exchanging information between network elements 
   in order to authorize the use of resources for a service and to co-
   ordinate actions between the session and resource management 
   entities. Specific extensions to session control protocols (e.g. SIP 
   [6], H.323), to resource reservation protocols (e.g. RSVP [7], 
   YESSIR) and to policy managements protocols (e.g. COPS-SIP, COPS-
   RSVP [4]) required to realize these scenarios and mechanisms are 
   beyond the scope of this document.

         Framework for session set-up with media authorization 
 
   For clarity, this document will illustrate the media authorization 
   concepts using SIP for session signalling, RSVP for resource 
   reservation and COPS for interaction with the policy servers. Note, 
   however, that the framework could be applied to a multimedia 
   services scenario using different signalling protocols.

   Figure 1: Generic media authorization network model  
    
    
   EH - End Host: The End Host is a device used by a subscriber to 
   access network services. The End Host includes a client for 
   requesting network services (e.g. through SIP) and a client for 
   requesting network resources (e.g. through RSVP). 
    
   ER - Edge Router: The Edge Router is a network element connecting 
   the end host to the rest of the Resource Control District. The Edge 
   Router contains a PEP to enforce policies related to resource usage 
   in the Resource Control District by the End Host. It also contains a 
   signalling agent (e.g. for RSVP) for handling resource reservation 
   requests from the End Host.

         Framework for session set-up with media authorization 
 
   PDP - Policy Decision Point: The PDP is a logical entity located in 
   the Policy Server that is responsible for authorizing or denying 
   access to services and/or resources. 
    
   PEP - Policy Enforcement Point: The PEP is a logical entity that 
   enforces policy decisions made by the PDP. Note that other PEPs may 
   reside in other network elements not shown in the model of Figure 1, 
   however they will not be discussed in this document. 
    
   PS - Policy Server: The Policy Server is a network element that 
   includes a PDP. Note that there may be a PS in the Service Control 
   District to control use of services and there may be a separate PS 
   in the Resource Control District to control use of resources along 
   the packet forwarding path. Note also that network topology may 
   require multiple Policy Servers within either district, however they 
   provide consistent policy decisions to offer the appearance of a 
   single PDP in each district. 
    
   RCD - Resource Control District: The Resource Control District is a 
   logical grouping of elements that provide connectivity along the 
   packet forwarding paths to and from an End Host. The RCD contains ER 
   and PS entities whose responsibilities include management of 
   resources along the packet forwarding paths. 
    
   SCD - Service Control District: The Service Control District is a 
   logical grouping of elements that offer applications and content to 
   subscribers of their services. The Session Management Server resides 
   in the SCD along with a PS. 
    
   SMS - Session Management Server: The Session Management Server is a 
   network element providing session management services (e.g. 
   telephony call control).  The Session Management Server contains a 
   PEP to enforce policies related to use of services by the End Host. 
   It also contains a signalling agent or proxy (e.g. for SIP) for 
   handling service requests from the End Host.

4. The Coupled Model 
    
   In some environments, a pre-established trust relationship exists 
   between elements of the network (e.g. session managers, edge 
   routers, policy servers and end hosts). We refer to this as the 
   "coupled model", indicating the tight relationship between entities 
   that is presumed. The key aspects of this scenario are the 
   following:  
    
   -  Policy decisions, including media authorization, are made by a 
      single Policy Server. 
    
   -  The Edge Router, Session Manager and Policy Server involved in 
      establishing the session are known a priori. For example, the End 
      Host may be configured to use a Session Manager associated with 
      the Edge Router to which the EH is connected. 
    
   -  There are pre-defined trust relationships between the SMS and the 
      PS and between the ER and the PS.

4.1   Coupled Model Message Flows 
    
   In this model, it is assumed that there is one Policy Server serving 
   both the Service Control and Resource Control districts and that 
   there are pre-defined trust relationships between the PS and SMS and 
   between the PS and ER. Communications between these entities are 
   then possible as described below:

         Framework for session set-up with media authorization 
 
   1. The End Host issues a session set-up request (e.g. SIP INVITE) to 
      the Session Manager indicating, among other things, the media 
      streams to be used in the session. As part of this step, the End 
      Host may authenticate itself to the Session Manager. 
    
   2. The Session Manager, possibly after waiting for negotiation of 
      the media streams to be completed, sends a policy decision 
      request (e.g. COPS-SIP REQ) to the Policy Server in order to 
      determine if the session set-up request should be allowed to 
      proceed. 
    
   3. The Policy Server sends a decision (e.g. COPS-SIP DEC) to the 
      Session Manager, possibly after modifying the parameters of the 
      media to be used. Included in this response is a "token" that can 
      subsequently be used by the Policy Server to identify the session 
      and the media it has authorized. 
    
   4. The Session Manager sends a response to the End Host (e.g. SIP 
      200 or 183) indicating that session set-up is complete or is 
      progressing. Included in this response is a description of the 
      negotiated media along with the token from the Policy Server. 
    
   5. The End Host issues a request (e.g. RSVP PATH) to reserve the 
      resources necessary to provide the required QoS for the media 
      stream. Included in this request is the token from the Policy 
      Server provided via the Session Manager. 
    
   6. The Edge Router intercepts the reservation request and sends a 
      policy decision request (e.g. COPS-RSVP REQ) to the Policy Server 
      in order to determine if the resource reservation request should 
      be allowed to proceed. Included in this request is the token from 
      the Policy Server provided by the End Host. The Policy Server 
      uses this token to correlate the request for resources with the 
      media authorization previously provided to the Session Manager. 
    
   7. The Policy Server sends a decision (e.g. COPS-RSVP DEC) to the 
      Edge Router, possibly after modifying the parameters of the 
      resources to be reserved. 
    
   8. The Edge Router, possibly after waiting for end-to-end 
      negotiation for resources to be completed, sends a response to 
      the End Host (e.g. RSVP RESV) indicating that resource 
      reservation is complete or is progressing.

4.2   Coupled Model Authorization Token  
    
   In the Coupled Model, the Policy Server is the only network entity 
   that needs to interpret the contents of the token. Therefore, in 
   this model, the contents of the token are implementation dependent. 
   Since the End Host is assumed to be untrusted, the Policy Server 
   should take measures to ensure that the integrity of the token is 
   preserved in transit; the exact mechanisms to be used are also 
   implementation dependent. 
    
    
    
4.3   Coupled Model Protocol Impacts  
    
   The use of a media authorization token in the Coupled Model requires 
   the addition of new fields to several protocols: 
    
   -  Resource reservation protocol. A new protocol field or object 
      must be added to the resource reservation protocol to 
      transparently transport the token from the End Host to the Edge 
      Router. The content and internal structure (if any) of this 
      object should be opaque to the resource reservation protocol. 
    
   -  Policy management protocol. A new protocol field or object must 
      be added to the policy management protocol to transparently 
      transport the token from the Policy Server to the Session 
      Management Server and from the Edge Router to the Policy Server. 
      The content and internal structure (if any) of this object should 
      be opaque to the policy management protocol.  
    
   -  Session management protocol. A new protocol field or object must 
      be added to the session management protocol to transparently 
      transport the media authorization token from the Session 
      Management Server to the End Host. The content and internal 
      structure (if any) of this object should be opaque to the session 
      management protocol.

         Framework for session set-up with media authorization 
 
5. The Associated Model <<using One Policy Server>> 
    
   In this scenario, there are multiple instances of the Session 
   Management Servers, Edge Routers and Policy Servers. This leads to a 
   network of sufficient complexity that it precludes distributing 
   knowledge of network topology to all network entities. The key 
   aspects of this scenario are the following:  
    
   -  Policy decisions, including media authorization, are made by a 
      the same Policy Server for both the Session Manager and the Edge 
      Router. Basically, the SCD and RCD outsource policy decisions to
      the same policy server. However, the Policy Server may change on 
      per-transaction basis. 
    
   -  The Edge Router, Session Manager and Policy Server involved in 
      establishing the session are not known a priori. For example, the 
      End Host may be dynamically configured to use one of a pool of 
      Session Managers and each of the Session Managers may be 
      statically configured to use one of a pool of Policy Servers. 
    
      In another example, the End Host may be mobile and continually 
      changing the Edge Router that its point of attachment uses to 
      communicate with the rest of the network. 
    
   -  There are pre-defined trust relationships between the SMS and the 
      PS and between the ER and the PS.

         Framework for session set-up with media authorization 
 
5.1   Associated Model Message Flows <<using One Policy Server>> 
    
   In this model, it is assumed that a Policy Server can make decisions 
   for both the Service Control and Resource Control districts and that 
   there are pre-defined trust relationships between the PS and SMS and 
   between the PS and ER. Communications between these entities are 
   then possible as described below: 
    
   1. The End Host issues a session set-up request (e.g. SIP INVITE) to 
      the Session Manager indicating, among other things, the media 
      streams to be used in the session. As part of this step, the End 
      Host may authenticate itself to the Session Manager. 
    
   2. The Session Manager, possibly after waiting for negotiation of 
      the media streams to be completed, sends a policy decision 
      request (e.g. COPS-SIP REQ) to the Policy Server in order to 
      determine if the session set-up request should be allowed to 
      proceed. 
    
   3. The Policy Server sends a decision (e.g. COPS-SIP DEC) to the 
      Session Manager, possibly after modifying the parameters of the 
      media to be used. Included in this response is a "token" that can 
      subsequently be used by the Policy Server to identify the session 
      and the media it has authorized. 
    
   4. The Session Manager sends a response to the End Host (e.g. SIP 
      200 or 183) indicating that session set-up is complete or is 
      progressing. Included in this response is a description of the 
      negotiated media along with the token from the Policy Server. 
    
   5. The End Host issues a request (e.g. RSVP PATH) to reserve the 
      resources necessary to provide the required QoS for the media 
      stream. Included in this request is the token from the Policy 
      Server provided via the Session Manager. 
    
   6. The Edge Router intercepts the reservation request and inspects 
      the token to learn which Policy Server authorized the media. It 
      then sends a policy decision request (e.g. COPS-RSVP REQ) to that 
      Policy Server in order to determine if the resource reservation 
      request should be allowed to proceed. Included in this request is 
      the token from the Policy Server provided by the End Host. The 
      Policy Server uses this token to correlate the request for 
      resources with the media authorization previously provided to the 
      Session Manager. 
    
   7. The Policy Server sends a decision (e.g. COPS-RSVP DEC) to the 
      Edge Router, possibly after modifying the parameters of the 
      resources to be reserved. 
    
   8. The Edge Router, possibly after waiting for end-to-end 
      negotiation for resources to be completed, sends a response to

      the End Host (e.g. RSVP RESV) indicating that resource 
      reservation is complete or is progressing. 
    
    
    
5.2   Associated Model Authorization Token <<using One Policy Server>> 
    
   Since the ER does not know which SMS and PS are involved in session 
   establishment, the token must include: 
    
   -  A correlation identifier. This is information that the Policy 
      Server can use to correlate the resource reservation request with 
      the media authorized during session set up. The Policy Server is 
      the only network entity that needs to interpret the contents of 
      the correlation identifier therefore, in this model, the contents 
      of the correlation identifier are implementation dependent. Since 
      the End Host is assumed to be untrusted, the Policy Server should 
      take measures to ensure that the integrity of the correlation 
      identifier is preserved in transit; the exact mechanisms to be 
      used are also implementation dependent. 
    
   -  The identity of the authorizing entity. This information is used 
      by the Edge Router to determine which Policy Server should be 
      used to solicit resource policy decisions. 
    
   In some environments, an Edge Router may have no means for 
   determining if the identity refers to a legitimate Policy Server 
   within its domain. In order to protect against redirection of 
   authorization requests to a bogus authorizing entity, the token 
   should also include: 
    
   -  An authentication signature. This signature is calculated over 
      all other fields of the token using an agreed mechanism. The Edge 
      Router must be able to verify the signature using credentials of 
      the signer to confirm a trust relationship. The mechanism used by 
      the Edge Router is beyond the scope of this document. 
    
    
    
5.3   Associated Model Protocol Impacts <<using One Policy Server>> 
    
   The use of a media authorization token in this version of the 
   Associated Model requires the addition of new fields to several 
   protocols: 
    
   -  Resource reservation protocol. A new protocol field or object 
      must be added to the resource reservation protocol to 
      transparently transport the token from the End Host to the Edge 
      Router. The content and internal structure of this object must be 
      specified so that the Edge Router can distinguish between the 
      elements of the token described in Section 5.2.

   -  Policy management protocol. A new protocol field or object must 
      be added to the policy management protocol to transparently 
      transport the token -- or at least the correlation identifier -- 
      from the Edge Router to the Policy Server. The content and 
      internal structure of this object should be opaque to the policy 
      management protocol.  
    
   -  Session management protocol. A new protocol field or object must 
      be added to the session management protocol to transparently 
      transport the media authorization token from the Session 
      Management Server to the End Host. The content and internal 
      structure of this object should be opaque to the session 
      management protocol.

6. The Associated Model <<using Two Policy Servers>> 
    
   In this scenario, there are multiple instances of the Session 
   Management Servers, Edge Routers and Policy Servers. This leads to a 
   network of sufficient complexity that it precludes distributing 
   knowledge of network topology to all network entities. The key 
   aspects of this scenario are the following:  
    
   -  Policy decisions, including media authorization, are made by 
      Policy Servers. 
    
   -  There is a PS in the Resource Control District that is separate 
      from the PS in the Session Control District. 
    
   -  The Edge Router, Session Manager and Policy Servers involved in 
      establishing the session are not known a priori. For example, the 
      End Host may be dynamically configured to use one of a pool of 
      Session Managers or the End Host may be mobile and continually 
      changing the Edge Router that it uses to communicate with the 
      rest of the network. 
    
   -  There is a pre-defined trust relationship between the SMS and the 
      SCD PS. 
    
   -  There is a pre-defined trust relationship between the ER and the 
      RCD PS. 
    
   -  There is a pre-defined trust relationship between the RCD and SCD 
      Policy Servers.

6.1   Associated Model Message Flows <<using Two Policy Servers>> 
    
   In this model, it is assumed that there is one Policy Server for the 
   Service Control District and a different Policy Server for the 
   Resource Control District. There are pre-defined trust relationships 
   between the SCD PS and SMS, between the RCD PS and ER and between 
   the RCD and SCD Policy Servers. Communications between these 
   entities are then possible as described below: 
    
   1. The End Host issues a session set-up request (e.g. SIP INVITE) to 
      the Session Manager indicating, among other things, the media 
      streams to be used in the session. As part of this step, the End 
      Host may authenticate itself to the Session Manager. 
    
   2. The Session Manager, possibly after waiting for negotiation of 
      the media streams to be completed, sends a policy decision 
      request (e.g. COPS-SIP REQ) to the SCD Policy Server in order to 
      determine if the session set-up request should be allowed to 
      proceed. 
    
   3. The SCD Policy Server sends a decision (e.g. COPS-SIP DEC) to the 
      Session Manager, possibly after modifying the parameters of the 
      media to be used. Included in this response is a "token" that can 
      subsequently be used by the SCD Policy Server to identify the 
      session and the media it has authorized. 
    
   4. The Session Manager sends a response to the End Host (e.g. SIP 
      200 or 183) indicating that session set-up is complete or is 
      progressing. Included in this response is a description of the 
      negotiated media along with the token from the SCD Policy Server. 
    
   5. The End Host issues a request (e.g. RSVP PATH) to reserve the 
      resources necessary to provide the required QoS for the media 
      stream. Included in this request is the token from the SCD Policy 
      Server provided via the Session Manager. 
    
   6. The Edge Router intercepts the reservation request and sends a 
      policy decision request (e.g. COPS-RSVP REQ) to the RCD Policy 
      Server in order to determine if the resource reservation request 
      should be allowed to proceed. Included in this request is the 
      token from the SCD Policy Server provided by the End Host. 
    
   7. The RCD Policy Server uses this token to learn which SCD Policy 
      Server authorized the media. It then sends an authorization 
      request (e.g. DIAMETER AA-Request) to that SCD Policy Server in
      order to determine if the resource reservation request should be 
      allowed to proceed. Included in this request is the token from 
      the SCD Policy Server provided by the End Host.

   8. The SCD Policy Server uses this token to correlate the request 
      for resources with the media authorization previously provided to 
      the Session Manager. The SCD Policy Server sends a decision (e.g. 
      DIAMETER AA-Answer) to the RCD Policy Server on whether the 
      requested resources are within the bounds authorized by the SCD 
      Policy Server. 
    
   9. The RCD Policy Server sends a decision (e.g. COPS-RSVP DEC) to 
      the Edge Router, possibly after modifying the parameters of the 
      resources to be reserved. 
    
   10. The Edge Router, possibly after waiting for end-to-end 
      negotiation for resources to be completed, sends a response to 
      the End Host (e.g. RSVP RESV) indicating that resource 
      reservation is complete or is progressing

   involved in session establishment, the token must include: 
    
   -  A correlation identifier. This is information that the SCD Policy 
      Server can use to correlate the resource reservation request with 
      the media authorized during session set up. The SCD Policy Server 
      is the only network entity that needs to interpret the contents 
      of the correlation identifier therefore, in this model, the 
      contents of the correlation identifier are implementation

      Policy Server should take measures to ensure that the integrity 
      of the correlation identifier is preserved in transit; the exact 
      mechanisms to be used are also implementation dependent. 
    
   -  The identity of the authorizing entity. This information is used 
      by the RCD Policy Server to determine which SCD Policy Server 
      should be used to verify the contents of the resource reservation 
      request. 
    
   In some environments, an RCD Policy Server may have no means for 
   determining if the identity refers to a legitimate SCD Policy 
   Server. In order to protect against redirection of authorization

   Note that the information in this token is the same as that in 
   Section 5.2 for the "One Policy Server" scenario. 
    
    
    
6.3   Associated Model Protocol Impacts <<using Two Policy Servers>> 
    
   The use of a media authorization token in this version of the 
   Associated Model requires the addition of new fields to several 
   protocols: 
    
   -  Resource reservation protocol. A new protocol field or object 
      must be added to the resource reservation protocol to 
      transparently transport the token from the End Host to the Edge 
      Router. The content and internal structure of this object should 
      be opaque to the resource reservation protocol. 
    
   -  Policy management protocol. A new protocol field or object must 
      be added to the policy management protocol to transport the token 
      from the SCD Policy Server to the Session Management Server and 
      from the Edge Router to the RCD Policy Server. The content and 
      internal structure of this object must be specified so that the 
      Policy Servers can distinguish between the elements of the token 
      described in Section 6.2.  
    
   -  Session management protocol. A new protocol field or object must 
      be added to the session management protocol to transparently 
      transport the media authorization token from the Session 
      Management Server to the End Host. The content and internal 
      structure of this object should be opaque to the session 
      management protocol. 
    
   Note that these impacts are the same as those discussed in Section 
   5.3 for the "One Policy Server" scenario. However the use of two 
   Policy Servers has one additional impact: 
    
   -  Authorization protocol. A new protocol field or object must be 
      added to the authorization protocol to transport the token from 
      the RCD Policy Server to the SCD Policy Server. The content and 
      internal structure of this object must be specified so that the 
      Policy Servers can distinguish between the elements of the token 
      described in Section 6.2.

7. The Non-Associated Model  
    
   In this scenario, the Session Management Servers and Edge Routers 
   are associated with different Policy Servers, the network entities 
   do not have a priori knowledge of the topology of the network and 
   there are no pre-established trust relationships between entities in 
   the Resource Control District and entities in the Service Control 
   District. The keys aspects of this scenario are the following:  
    
   -  Policy decisions, including media authorization, are made by 
      Policy Servers. 
    
   -  The PS in the Resource Control District is separate from the PS 
      in the Session Control District. 
    
   -  There is a pre-defined trust relationship between the SMS and the 
      SCD PS. 
    
   -  There is a pre-defined trust relationship between the ER and the 
      RCD PS. 
    
   -  There are no pre-defined trust relationships between the ER and 
      SMS or between the RCD and SCD Policy Servers.

         Framework for session set-up with media authorization 
 
   information exchange between policy servers. Communications between 
   network entities in this model is described below: 
    
   1. The End Host issues a session set-up request (e.g. SIP INVITE) to 
      the Session Manager indicating, among other things, the media 
      streams to be used in the session. As part of this step, the End 
      Host may authenticate itself to the Session Manager. 
    
   2. The Session Manager, possibly after waiting for negotiation of 
      the media streams to be completed, sends a policy decision 
      request (e.g. COPS-SIP REQ) to the SCD Policy Server in order to 
      determine if the session set-up request should be allowed to 
      proceed. 
    
   3. The SCD Policy Server sends a decision (e.g. COPS-SIP DEC) to the 
      Session Manager, possibly after modifying the parameters of the 
      media to be used. Included in this response is a "token" that can 
      subsequently be used by the RCD Policy Server to determine what 
      media has been authorized. 
    
   4. The Session Manager sends a response to the End Host (e.g. SIP 
      200 or 183) indicating that session set-up is complete or is 
      progressing. Included in this response is a description of the 
      negotiated media along with the token from the SCD Policy Server. 
    
   5. The End Host issues a request (e.g. RSVP PATH) to reserve the 
      resources necessary to provide the required QoS for the media 
      stream. Included in this request is the token from the SCD Policy 
      Server provided via the Session Manager. 
    
   6. The Edge Router intercepts the reservation request and sends a 
      policy decision request (e.g. COPS-RSVP REQ) to the RCD Policy 
      Server in order to determine if the resource reservation request 
      should be allowed to proceed. Included in this request is the 
      token from the SCD Policy Server provided by the End Host. 
    
   7. The RCD Policy Server uses this token to extract information 
      about the media that was authorized by the SCD Policy Server. The 
      RCD Policy Server uses this information in making its decision on 
      whether the resource reservation should be allowed to proceed. 
    
      The Policy Server sends a decision (e.g. COPS-RSVP DEC) to the 
      Edge Router, possibly after modifying the parameters of the 
      resources to be reserved. 
    
   8. The Edge Router, possibly after waiting for end-to-end 
      negotiation for resources to be completed, sends a response to 
      the End Host (e.g. RSVP RESV) indicating that resource 
      reservation is complete or is progressing

7.2   Non-Associated Model Authorization Token 
    
   In this model, the token must contain sufficient information to 
   allow the RCD Policy Server to make resource policy decisions 
   autonomously from the SCD Policy Server. The token is created using 
   information about the session received by the SMS. The information 
   in the token must include: 
    
   -  Calling party IP address and port number (e.g. from SDP "c=" 
      parameter). 
    
   -  Called party IP address and port number (e.g. from SDP "c=" 
      parameter). 
    
   -  The characteristics of (each of) the media stream(s) authorized 
      for this session (e.g. codecs, maximum bandwidth from SDP "m=" 
      and/or "b=" parameters). 
    
   -  The lifetime of (each of) the media stream(s) (e.g. from SDP "t=" 
      parameter). 
    
   -  The authorization lifetime (e.g. the token should be valid for 
      only a few seconds after the start time of the session). 
    
   -  The identity of the authorizing entity to allow for validation of 
      the token. 
    
   -  An authentication signature used to prevent tampering with the 
      token and to provide the credentials of the authorizing entity. 
      This signature is calculated over all other fields of the token 
      using an agreed mechanism. The RCD Policy Server must be able to 
      verify the signature using credentials of the signer to confirm a 
      trust relationship. The mechanism used by the RCD Policy Server 
      is beyond the scope of this document.  
    
    
    
7.3   Non-Associated Model Protocol Impacts  
    
   The use of a media authorization token in the Non-Associated Model 
   requires the addition of new fields to several protocols: 
    
   -  Resource reservation protocol. A new protocol field or object 
      must be added to the resource reservation protocol to 
      transparently transport the token from the End Host to the Edge 
      Router. The content and internal structure of this object should 
      be opaque to the resource reservation protocol. 
    
   -  Policy management protocol. A new protocol field or object must 
      be added to the policy management protocol to transport the token

         Framework for session set-up with media authorization 
 
      from the SCD Policy Server to the Session Management Server and 
      from the Edge Router to the RCD Policy Server. The content and 
      internal structure of this object must be specified so that the 
      Policy Servers can distinguish between the elements of the token 
      described in Section 7.2.  
    
   -  Session management protocol. A new protocol field or object must 
      be added to the session management protocol to transparently 
      transport the media authorization token from the Session 
      Management Server to the End Host. The content and internal 
      structure of this object should be opaque to the session 
      management protocol. 
    
    
    
8. Conclusions 
    
   In this document we have defined three models for authorizing media 
   during session establishment: 
    
   -  The Coupled Model which assumes a priori knowledge of network 
      topology and where pre-established trust relationships exist 
      between network entities. 
    
   -  The Associated Model where there are common or trusted policy 
      servers but knowledge of the network topology is not known a 
      priori. 
    
   -  The Non-Associated Model where knowledge of the network topology 
      is not known a priori, where there are different policy servers 
      involved and where a trust relationship does not exist between 
      the policy servers. 
    
   The Associated Model is applicable to environments where the network 
   elements involved in establishing a session have a pre-determined 
   trust relationship but where their identities must be determined 
   dynamically during session set up. The Non-Associated Model is 
   applicable to environments where there is a complex network topology 
   and/or where trust relationships between domains do not exist. 
    
   In any given network, one or more of these models may be applicable. 
   Indeed, the model to be used may be chosen dynamically during 
   session establishment based on knowledge of the end points involved 
   in the call. In all cases, however, there is no need for the End 
   Host, the Edge Router or the Session Management Server to understand 
   or interpret the authorization token - to them it is an opaque 
   protocol element that is simply copied from one container protocol 
   to another.

         Framework for session set-up with media authorization 
 
   Finally, the framework defined in this document is extensible to any 
   kind of session management protocol coupled to any one of a number 
   of resource reservation and/or policy management protocols. 
    
    
    
9. Security Considerations  
    
   The purpose of this draft is to describe a mechanism for media 
   authorization to prevent theft of service. It does not cover other 
   possible security breaches such as IP spoofing. 
    
   This draft assumes that trust relationships exist between various 
   network entities, as described in each of the models. The means for 
   establishing these relationships are beyond the scope of this 
   document. 
    
   For the authorization token to be effective, its integrity must be 
   guaranteed as it passes through untrusted network entities such as 
   the End Host. This can be achieved by using digital signatures.
