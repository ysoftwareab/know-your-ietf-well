INTERNET DRAFT      Introduction to RMON            May 2003


1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

2. Definition of RMON

   Remote network monitoring devices, often called monitors or probes,
   are instruments that exist for the purpose of managing and/or
   monitoring a network. Often these remote probes are stand-alone
   devices and devote significant internal resources for the sole
   purpose of managing a network.  An organization may employ many of
   these devices, up to one per network segment, to manage its internet.
   In addition, these devices may be used to manage a geographically
   remote network such as a for a network management support center of
   service provider to manage a client network or for the central
   support organization of an enterprise to manage a remote site.

   When the work on the RMON documents was started, this device-oriented
   definition of RMON was taken quite literally, as RMON devices were
   purpose-built probes and dedicated to implementing the RMON MIB
   modules. Soon, cards were introduced that added RMON capability into
   a network hub, switch or router. RMON also began to appear as a
   software capability that was added to the software of certain network
   equipment, as well as software applications that could run on servers
   or clients. Despite the variety of these approaches, the RMON
   capability in each serves as a dedicated network management resource
   available for activities ranging from long-term data collection and
   analysis or for ad-hoc firefighting.

   In the beginning, most, but not all, of RMON's capabilities were
   based on the promiscuous capture of packets on a network segment or
   segments. Over time, that mixture included more and more capabilities
   that didn't depend on promiscuous packet capture. Today, some of the
   newest documents added to the RMON framework allow multiple
   techniques of data gathering, where promiscuous packet capture is

   just one of several implementation options.

3. Goals of RMON

       o Offline Operation
           There are sometimes conditions when a management
           station will not be in constant contact with its
           remote monitoring devices.  This is sometimes by
           design in an attempt to lower communications costs
           (especially when communicating over a WAN or
           dialup link), or by accident as network failures
           affect the communications between the management
           station and the probe.

           For this reason, RMON allows a probe to be
           configured to perform diagnostics and to collect
           statistics continuously, even when communication with
           the management station may not be possible or
           efficient.  The probe may then attempt to notify
           the management station when an exceptional condition
           occurs.  Thus, even in circumstances where
           communication between management station and probe is
           not continuous, fault, performance, and configuration
           information may be continuously accumulated and
           communicated to the management station conveniently
           and efficiently.

       o Proactive Monitoring
           Given the resources available on the monitor, it
           is potentially helpful for it continuously to run
           diagnostics and to log network performance.  The
           monitor is always available at the onset of any
           failure.  It can notify the management station of the
           failure and can store historical statistical
           information about the failure.  This historical
           information can be played back by the management
           station in an attempt to perform further diagnosis
           into the cause of the problem.

       o Problem Detection and Reporting
           The monitor can be configured to recognize
           conditions, most notably error conditions, and
           continuously to check for them.  When one of these
           conditions occurs, the event may be logged, and
           management stations may be notified in a number of
           ways.



RMON MIB WG         Expires November 2003           [Page 4]





INTERNET DRAFT      Introduction to RMON            May 2003


       o Value Added Data
           Because a remote monitoring device represents a
           network resource dedicated exclusively to network
           management functions, and because it is located
           directly on the monitored portion of the network, the
           remote network monitoring device has the opportunity
           to add significant value to the data it collects.
           For instance, by highlighting those hosts on the
           network that generate the most traffic or errors, the
           probe can give the management station precisely the
           information it needs to solve a class of problems.

       o Multiple Managers
           An organization may have multiple management stations
           for different units of the organization, for different
           functions (e.g. engineering and operations), and in an
           attempt to provide disaster recovery.  Because
           environments with multiple management stations are
           common, the remote network monitoring device has to
           deal with more than one management station,
           potentially using its resources concurrently.
4. RMON Documents

   The RMON Framework includes a number of documents. Each document that
   makes up the RMON framework defines some new useful behavior (i.e. an
   application) and managed objects that configure, control and monitor
   that behavior. This section lists those documents and described the
   role of each.

   One of the key ways to differentiate the various RMON MIB modules is
   by noting at which layer they operate. Because the RMON MIB modules
   take measurements and present aggregates of those measurements, there
   are 2 criteria to quantify for each MIB:

     1. At which layers does the MIB take measurements?

        For example, the RMON MIB measures data-link layer attributes
        (e.g., packets, bytes, errors), while the APM MIB measures
        application layer attributes (e.g., response time). Supporting
        measurement at higher layers requires analysis deeper into the
        packet and many application layer measurements require stateful
        flow analysis.

     2. At which layers does the MIB aggegate measurements?

        This criteria notes the granularity of aggregation. For example,



RMON MIB WG         Expires November 2003           [Page 5]





INTERNET DRAFT      Introduction to RMON            May 2003


        the RMON MIB aggregates its measurements to the link, hardware
        address, or hardware address pair - all data-link concepts. In
        contrast, the RMON2 MIB takes the same data-link metrics
        (packets, bytes, errors) and aggregates them based on network
        address, transport protocol, or appplication protocol.

   Note that a MIB may take measurements at one level while aggregating
   at different levels. Also note that a MIB may function at multiple
   levels. Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the measurement layers and
   aggregation layers for each MIB.

4.1 RMON-1

   The RMON-1 standard [RFC2819] is focused at layer 2 and provides



RMON MIB WG         Expires November 2003           [Page 6]





INTERNET DRAFT      Introduction to RMON            May 2003


   link-layer statistics aggregated in a variety of ways. In addition,
   it provides generation of alarms when thresholds are crossed as well
   as the ability to filter and capture packet contents. The components
   of RMON-1 are:

     The Ethernet Statistics Group

         The ethernet statistics group contains statistics measured by
         the probe for each monitored Ethernet interface on this device.

     The History Control Group

         The history control group controls the periodic statistical
         sampling of data from various types of network media.

     The Ethernet History Group

         The ethernet history group records periodic statistical samples
         from an ethernet network and stores them for later retrieval.

     The Alarm Group

         The alarm group periodically takes statistical samples from
         variables in the probe and compares them to previously
         configured thresholds.  If the monitored variable crosses a
         threshold, an event is generated.  A hysteresis mechanism is
         implemented to limit the generation of alarms.

     The Host Group

         The host group contains statistics associated with each host
         discovered on the network.  This group discovers hosts on the
         network by keeping a list of source and destination MAC
         Addresses seen in good packets promiscuously received from the
         network.

     The HostTopN Group

         The hostTopN group is used to prepare reports that describe the
         hosts that top a list ordered by one of their statistics.  The
         available statistics are samples of one of their base
         statistics over an interval specified by the management
         station.  Thus, these statistics are rate based.  The
         management station also selects how many such hosts are
         reported.

INTERNET DRAFT      Introduction to RMON            May 2003


     The Matrix Group

         The matrix group stores statistics for conversations between
         sets of two MAC addresses.  As the device detects a new
         conversation, it creates a new entry in its tables.

     The Filter Group

         The filter group allows packets to be matched by a filter
         equation.  These matched packets form a data stream that may be
         captured or may generate events.

     The Packet Capture Group

         The Packet Capture group allows packets to be captured after
         they flow through a channel.

     The Event Group

         The event group controls the generation and notification of
         events from this device.

4.2 Token Ring Extensions to RMON MIB

   Some of the functions defined in the RMON-1 MIB were defined specific
   to Ethernet media. In order to operate the functions on Token Ring
   Media, new objects needed to be defined in the Token Ring Extensions
   to RMON MIB [RFC1513]. In addition, this MIB defines additional
   objects that provide monitoring functions unique to Token Ring.

   The components of the Token Ring Extensions to RMON MIB are:

     The Token Ring Statistics Groups

         The Token Ring statistics groups contain current utilization
         and error statistics.  The statistics are broken down into two
         groups, the Token Ring Mac-Layer Statistics Group and the Token
         Ring Promiscuous Statistics Group.  The Token Ring Mac-Layer
         Statistics Group collects information from Mac Layer, including
         error reports for the ring and ring utilization of the Mac
         Layer.  The Token Ring Promiscuous Statistics Group collects
         utilization statistics from data packets collected
         promiscuously.

     The Token Ring History Groups




RMON MIB WG         Expires November 2003           [Page 8]





INTERNET DRAFT      Introduction to RMON            May 2003


         The Token Ring History Groups contain historical utilization
         and error statistics.  The statistics are broken down into two
         groups, the Token Ring Mac-Layer History Group and the Token
         Ring Promiscuous History Group.  The Token Ring Mac-Layer
         History Group collects information from Mac Layer, including
         error reports for the ring and ring utilization of the Mac
         Layer.  The Token Ring Promiscuous History Group collects
         utilization statistics from data packets collected
         promiscuously.

     The Token Ring Ring Station Group

         The Token Ring Ring Station Group contains statistics and
         status information associated with each Token Ring station on
         the local ring.  In addition, this group provides status
         information for each ring being monitored.

     The Token Ring Ring Station Order Group

         The Token Ring Ring Station Order Group provides the order of
         the stations on monitored rings.

     The Token Ring Ring Station Config Group

         The Token Ring Ring Station Config Group manages token ring
         stations through active means.  Any station on a monitored ring
         may be removed or have configuration information downloaded
         from it.

     The Token Ring Source Routing Group

         The Token Ring Source Routing Group contains utilization
         statistics derived from source routing information optionally
         present in token ring packets.

4.3 The RMON-2 MIB

   The RMON-2 MIB [RFC2021] extends the architecture defined in RMON-1
   primarily by

   extending RMON analysis up to the application layer.

   The components of the RMON-2 MIB are:

     The Protocol Directory Group




RMON MIB WG         Expires November 2003           [Page 9]





INTERNET DRAFT      Introduction to RMON            May 2003


         Every RMON 2 implementation will have the capability to parse
         certain types of packets and identify their protocol type at
         multiple levels.  The protocol directory presents an inventory
         of those protocol types the probe is capable of monitoring, and
         allows the addition, deletion, and configuration of protocol
         types in this list.

     Protocol Distribution Group

         This function controls collection of packet and octet counts
         for any or all of the protocols detected on a given interface.
         An NMS can use this table to quickly determine bandwidth
         allocation utilized by different protocols.

     Address Mapping Group

         This function lists MAC address to network address bindings
         discovered by the probe and what interface they were last seen
         on.

     Network Layer Host Group

         This function counts the amount of traffic sent from and to
         each network address discovered by the probe.

     Network Layer Matrix Group

         This function counts the amount of traffic sent between each
         pair of network addresses discovered by the probe.

     Application Layer Host Group

         This function counts the amount of traffic, by protocol, sent
         from and to each network address discovered by the probe.

     Application Layer Matrix

         This function counts the amount of traffic, by protocol, sent
         between each pair of network addresses discovered by the probe.

     User History

         This function allows an NMS to request that certain variables
         on the probe be periodically polled and for a time-series to be
         stored of the polled values. This builds a user-configurable
         set of variables to be monitored (not to be confused with data



RMON MIB WG         Expires November 2003          [Page 10]





INTERNET DRAFT      Introduction to RMON            May 2003


         about users).

     Probe Configuration

         This group contains configuration objects that configure many
         aspects of the probe including the software downloaded to the
         probe, the out of band serial connection and the network
         connection.

4.4 RMON MIB Protocol Identifiers

   The RMON-2 MIB identifies protocols at any layer of the 7 layer
   hierarchy with an identifier called a Protocol Identifier, or
   ProtocolID for short. ProtocolIDs also identify the particular
   configuration of layering in use including any arbitrary
   encapsulations. The RMON MIB Protocol Identifiers document [RFC2896]
   is a companion document to the RMON-2 MIB that defines a number of
   well-known protocols. Another document, the RMON MIB Protocol
   Identifiers Macros [RFC2895], defines a macro format for the
   description of these well-known protocols and others that may be
   described in the future.

   As the RMON Framework has grown, other documents have been added to
   the framework that utilize ProtocolIDs.

4.5 Remote Network Monitoring MIB Extensions for Switched Networks (SMON
   MIB)

   Switches have become pervasive in today's networks as a form of
   broadcast media. SMON [RFC2613] provides RMON-like functions for the
   monitoring of switched networks.

   Switches today differ from standard shared media protocols because:

      1)   Data is not, in general, broadcast.  This MAY be caused by the
           switch architecture  or by the connection-oriented nature of the
           data. This means, therefore, that monitoring non-broadcast
           traffic needs to be considered.

      2)   Monitoring the multiple entry and exit points from a switching
           device requires a vast amount of resources - memory and CPU, and
           aggregation of the data in logical packets of information,
           determined by the application needs.

      3)   Switching incorporates logical segmentation such as Virtual LANs
           (VLANs).

      4)   Switching incorporates packet prioritization.

      5)   Data across the switch fabric can be in the form of cells. Like
           RMON, SMON is only concerned with the monitoring of packets.

   Differences such as these make monitoring difficult. The SMON MIB
   provides the following functions that help to manage switched
   networks:

     smonVlanStats

         This function provides traffic statistics per Virtual LAN for
         802.1q VLANs.

     smonPrioStats

         This function provides traffic statistics per priority level
         for 802.1q VLANS.

     dataSourceCaps

         This function identifies all supported data sources on an SMON
         device. An NMS MAY use this table to discover the RMON and Copy
         Port attributes of each data source.

     portCopyConfig

         Many network switches provide the capability to make a copy of
         traffic seen on one port and send it out another port for
         management purposes.  This occurs in addition to any copying
         performed during the normal forwarding behavior of the switch.

         The portCopyConfig function provides control of the port copy
         functionality in a device.

4.6 RMON MIB Extensions for Interface Parameters Monitoring (IFTOPN)

   Many network switches contain hundreds of ports, many with only one
   attached device. A common operation when managing such a switch is to
   sort the interfaces by one of the parameters (e.g. to the find the
   most highly utilized interface). If the switch contains many
   interfaces it can be expensive and time consuming to download
   information for all interfaces to sort it on the NMS. Instead, the
   ifTopN MIB [RFC3144] allows the sorting to occur on the switch and
   for only the top interfaces to be downloaded.

4.7 RMON Extensions for Differentiated Services (DSMON MIB)

   This MIB [RFC3287] defines extensions of RMON for monitoring the
   traffic usage of Differentiated Services [RFC2474] codepoint values.
   The 6-bit DiffServ codepoint portion (DSCP) of the Type of Service
   (TOS) octet in the IP header provides for 64 different packet
   treatments for the implementation of differentiated network devices.
   DSMON-capable RMON probes collect and aggregate statistics based on
   the inspection of the DSCP value in monitored packets.

   The DSMON MIB defines a DSCP counter aggregation mechanism to reduce
   the total number of counters by configuring the agent to internally
   aggregate counters based on the DSCP value. This mechanism is
   designed to overcome the agent data collection limitation, performs
   data reduction at the agent and applications level, and optimizes the
   application for cases when some codepoint values are not used, or
   lead to similar packet treatment in the monitored network domain.

   The components of the DSMON MIB are:

     The Aggregate Control Group

         The Aggregate Control Group enables the configuration of the
         counter aggregation groups.

     The DSMON Statistics Group

         The DSMON Statistics Group contains per counter aggregation
         group distribution statistics for a particular RMON data
         source.

     The DSMON Protocol Distribution Group

         The DSMON Protocol Distribution Group reports per counter
         aggregation distribution statistics for each application
         protocol detected on a particular RMON data source.

     The DSMON Host Group

         The DSMON Host Group contains host address distribution
         statistics for each counter aggregation group, detected on a
         particular RMON data source.

     The DSMON Capabilities Group

         The DSMON Capabilities Group reports the DSMON MIB functional

         capabilities of the agent implementation.

     The DSMON Matrix Group

         The DSMON Matrix Group contains host address pair distribution
         statistics for each counter aggregation group, detected on a
         particular RMON data source.


4.8 RMON for High Capacity Networks (HCRMON MIB)

   This MIB [RFC3272] defines extensions to RMON for use on high
   capacity networks. Except for the mediaIndependentTable, each of the
   tables in this MIB adds high capacity capability to an associated
   table in the RMON-1 MIB or RMON-2 MIB.

   The mediaIndependentTable provides media independent utilization and
   error statistics for full-duplex and half-duplex media. Prior to the
   existence of the HCRMON MIB, a new table needed to be created for
   RMON monitoring of each data-link layer media. These tables included
   many statistical attributes of the media including packet and octet
   counters that are independent of the media type. This wasn't optimal
   because there was no way to monitor media types for which a media-
   specific table had not been defined. Further, there were no common
   objects to monitor media-independent attributes between media types.

   In the future, for media other than ethernet and token ring, the
   mediaIndependentTable will be the source for media-independent
   statistics. Additional media-specific tables may be created to
   provide attributes unique to particular media such as error counters.

4.9 Application Performance Measurement MIB (APM MIB)

   The APM MIB [APM] provides analysis of application performance as
   experienced by end-users.

   Application performance measurement measures the quality of service
   delivered to end-users by applications. With this perspective, a true
   end-to-end view of the IT infrastructure results, combining the
   performance of the application, desktop, network, and server, as well
   as any positive or negative interactions between these components.

   Despite all the technically sophisticated ways in which networking
   and system resources can be measured, human end-users perceive only
   two things about an application: availability and responsiveness.




RMON MIB WG         Expires November 2003          [Page 14]





INTERNET DRAFT      Introduction to RMON            May 2003


      Availability - The percentage of the time that the application is
      ready to give a user service.

      Responsiveness - The speed at which the application delivers the
      requested service.

   The APM MIB includes the following functions:

     The APM Application Directory Group

         The APM Application Directory group contains configuration
         objects for every application or application verb monitored on
         this system.

     The APM User Defined Applications Group

         The APM User Defined Applications Group contains objects that
         allow for the tracking of applications or application verbs
         that aren't registered in the protocolDirectoryTable.

     The APM Report Group

         The APM Report Group is used to prepare regular reports that
         aggregate application performance by flow, by client, by
         server, or by application.

     The APM Transaction Group

         The APM Transaction Group is used to show transactions that are
         currently in progress and ones that have ended recently, along
         with their responsiveness metric.

         One important benefit of this table is that it allows a
         management station to check on the status of long-lived
         transactions. Because the apmReport and apmException mechanisms
         act only on transactions that have finished, a network manager
         may not have visibility for some time into the performance of
         long-lived transactions such as streaming applications, large
         data transfers, or (very) poorly performing transactions. In
         fact, by their very definition, the apmReport and apmException
         mechanisms only provide visibility into a problem after nothing
         can be done about it.

     The APM Exception Group

         The APM Exception Group is used to generate immediate

INTERNET DRAFT      Introduction to RMON            May 2003


         notifications of transactions that cross certain thresholds.
         The apmExceptionTable is used to configure which thresholds are
         to be checked for which types of transactions. The
         apmTransactionResponsivenessAlarm notification is sent when a
         transaction occurs with a responsiveness that crosses a
         threshold. The apmTransactionUnsuccessfulAlarm notification is
         sent when a transaction fails for which exception checking was
         configured.

     The APM Notification Group

         The APM Notification Group contains 2 notifications that are
         sent when thresholds in the APM Exception Table are exceeded.

4.10 RMON MIB Protocol Identifier Reference Extensions

   The protocol identifier defined in RMON2 [RFC2021] can identify any
   protocol at any layer and its encapsulation. The protocol identifier
   macro document [RFC2896] defines a convenient human readable and
   machine parseable format for documenting well-known protocols.

   For the most part the protocol identifiers used by RMON2
   implementations have described protocols at any layer including the
   application layer but haven't gone any deeper into the application.
   In order to differentiate an application's behavior while performing
   different tasks (logging in vs. downloading, for example) it is
   important to have a separate protocol identifier for each application
   "verb". The macro defined in [RFC2896] is inconvenient for defining
   application verbs because it assumes that most protocols are
   identified by an integer type field and many or most applications use
   other means for identifying verbs, including character strings.

   These extensions define another macro for defining application verbs
   that are children of an application. The parent application can be
   defined with the original protocol identifier macro and the
   application verbs are defined with the new macro.

4.11 Transport Performance Metrics MIB (TPM MIB)

   The TPM MIB [TPM] monitors selectable performance metrics and
   statistics derived from the monitoring of network packets and sub-
   application level transactions.  The MIB is defined to compliment the
   APM reports by providing a 'drill-down' capability to better
   understand selected applications' performance. The metrics are
   defined through reference to existing IETF, ITU and other standards
   organizations' documents.  The monitoring covers both passive and

INTERNET DRAFT      Introduction to RMON            May 2003


   active traffic generation sources.

   The TPM MIB includes the following functions:

     The tpmCapabilities Group

         The tpmCapabilitiesGroup contains objects and tables that show
         the measurement protocol and metric capabilities of the agent.

     The tpmAggregateReports Group

         The tpmAggregateReportsGroup is used to provide the collection
         of aggregated statistical measurements for the configured
         report intervals.

     The tpmCurrentReports Group

         The tpmCurrentReportsGroup is used to provide the collection of
         uncompleted measurements for the current configured report for
         those transactions caught in progress. A history of these
         transactions is also maintained once the current transaction
         has completed.

     The tpmExceptionReports Group

         The tpmExceptionReportsGroup is used to link immediate
         notifications of transactions that exceed certain thresholds
         defined in the apmExceptionGroup [APM]. This group reports the
         aggregated sub-application measurements for those applications
         exceeding thresholds.

4.12 Synthetic Sources for Performance Monitoring MIB (SSPM MIB)

   The Synthetic Sources for Performance Monitoring MIB [SSPM] covers
   the artificial generation of a) application-level, b) transport-
   level, and c) link-level traffic for the purpose of monitoring system
   performance.  There are situations where it is useful to be able to
   control the generation of synthetic traffic when evaluating system
   performance.  There are other situations where system performance
   evaluation can rely upon naturally generated application-level
   traffic, in which case one needs only monitor existing traffic and
   not instrument synthetic traffic. The SSPM MIB provides the ability
   to configure and control the generation of this synthetic traffic.

4.13 RMON MIB Extensions for High Capacity Alarms




RMON MIB WG         Expires November 2003          [Page 17]





INTERNET DRAFT      Introduction to RMON            May 2003


   There is a need for a standardized way of providing the same type of
   alarm thresholding capabilities for Counter64 objects, as already
   exists for Counter32 objects. The RMON-1 alarmTable objects and
   RMON-1 notification types are specific to 32-bit objects, and cannot
   be used to properly monitor Counter64-based objects.  Extensions to
   these existing constructs are needed which explicitly support
   Counter64-based objects.  These extensions are completely independent
   of the existing RMON-1 alarm mechanisms.

   This MIB [RFC3434] contains the following functions:

     The hcAlarmControlObjects group

         Controls the configuration of alarms for high capacity MIB
         object instances.

     The hcAlarmCapabilities group

         Describes the high capacity alarm capabilities provided by the
         agent.

     The hcAlarmNotifications group

         Provide new rising and falling threshold notifications for high
         capacity objects.

4.14 Real-Time Application Quality of Service Monitoring (RAQMON) MIB

   There is a need to extend the RMON framework to monitor end devices
   such as IP phones, pagers, Instant Message Clients, mobile phones,
   and PDA devices.  This memo proposes an extension of RMON Framework
   to allow Real-time Application QoS information of these types of end
   devices to be retrieved with SNMP, independent of the technology used
   to perform the measurements. An end-to-end user experience of the
   quality of service (QoS) and performance for such an application is a
   combination of device performance, transport network performance and
   specific application context.

   RAQMON [RAQMON-FRAMEWORK] defines a common framework to identify a
   set of application QoS parameters and a reporting mechanism using a
   common protocol data unit (PDU) format used between RAQMON Data
   Source (RDS) and RAQMON Report Collector (RRC) to report QOS
   statistics using RTCP and SNMP as underlying transport protocol.

   See the RAQMON MIB [RAQMON-MIB] for more information about its
   components.

5. RMON Framework Components

   The collection of documents in the RMON Framework are associated by
   1) A common purpose and similar collection methodologies; and, 2) Use
   of common infrastructure components

   These common infrastructure components are:
       - MediaIndependent Table
       - Protocol Directory
       - appDirectory
       - DataSource
       - Capabilities
       - Control Tables

5.1 MediaIndependent Table

   While many data-link media types exist and they each have unique
   features, there are many statistics that are common across most
   media. For example, counts of packets and octets are interesting for
   most media. The media independent table contains the most common such
   statistics and forms a super class from which specific interface
   types are inherited. This means that the common statistics can be
   monitored even for media types that are unknown.

   For example, if the mediaindependentTable had existed prior to the
   definition of the etherStatsTable, the etherStatsTable could have
   omitted the etherStatsDropEvents, etherStatsOctets, etherStatsPkts
   objects.

   The Media Independent Table is defined in the High Capacity RMON MIB
   [RFC3434].

5.2 Protocol Directory


     The second of the RMON infrastructure components is the
Protocol Directory Group defined in the RMON2 MIB [RFC2021].
The main objective of RMON2 was to extend the remote network
monitoring agents capabilities beyond link layer to higher
level protocol monitoring.  This required a means to glob-
ally identify individual protocol encapsulations.  This
capability is provided by the Protocol Directory Group and
specifically the protocolDirID found in the protocolDirTable
in the RMON2 MIB.

The Protocol Directory allows the agent to provide an



RMON MIB WG         Expires November 2003          [Page 19]





INTERNET DRAFT      Introduction to RMON            May 2003


inventory of the protocols that the agent can decode, count,
categorize and time.  The directory and its objects are
designed to allow for the addition, deletion and configura-
tion of the protocol encapsulations in the directory list.
Protocol Directory entries are identified primarily by an
object called the protocolDirID.  The protocolDirID is a
hierarchically formatted OCTET STRING that globally identi-
fies individual protocol encapsulations.  A protocol
descriptor macro has been defined in RFC 2895 [RFC2895] to
describe the various protocol layers supported in the proto-
colDirID protocol hierarchy.  The protocolDirID is defined
as a tree built up from successive protocol encapsulations.
Each layer is identified by a 4-octet identifier that iden-
tifies the child protocol within the context of the parent
protocol identified by the preceding identifiers.

Associated with each protocol layer in the protocolDirID is
a 1-octet parameter field.  Each parameter identifies poten-
tial options specific to that protocol, such as the agent's
capability to count fragmented packets correctly and to
track sessions for port mapped protocols, e.g., TFTP.  These
1-octet parameter fields are concatenated, in order, in the
protocolDirParameters object.

The protocolDirTable index is comprised of the proto-
colDirID, the protocolDirParameters and their associated
length fields.  The index format is shown in Figure 3.

      SNMP over UDP over IP over Ethernet.



The set of defined protocol layers currently described is
found in RFC2896 [RFC2896].  RFC2895 [RFC2895] defines a
process for submitting new protocols to add to the currently
defined set.  Periodic updates to RFC2896 will be published
to incorporate new protocol definitions that have been sub-
mitted.  In fact, RFC2896 is the second version of the
defined protocol macros, obsoleting RFC2074 [RFC2074].
RFC2895 also defines how to handle protocols that do not map
into this well-defined tree hierarchy built up from encapsu-
lation protocol identifiers.  An example of such a protocol
encapsulation is RTP, which is mapped to specific UDP ports
through a separate signaling mechanism.  These are handled
by the ianaAssigned protocols, as described in RFC2895.

The protocolDirTable is defined (and used) in the RMON2 MIB
[RFC2021], and is being used in other RMON WG MIBs as well
as other IETF defined MIBs.  Examples include the APM MIB
[APM], the TPM MIB [TPM] and the SSPM MIB [SSPM].

As mentioned in previous sections, the protocolDirID is
recently being extended in two ways.  First, work is under-
way on a new set of protocol descriptor macros which extend
the protocol encapsulation model to identify application
layer verbs [RFC3395].  This extension was motivated by the
work on the APM MIB and the TPM MIB.  Second, the APM MIB
defines the apmAppDirectoryTable that provides a directory
of applications that the agent can process.  This is dis-
cussed further in the following section.  Combined, these
extensions allow:

      + The APM MIB to define and monitor end-user's view of
      application performance.

      + The TPM MIB to clearly specify the sub-transactions
      that comprise the application it monitors through the



RMON MIB WG         Expires November 2003          [Page 21]

      tpmTransMetricDirTable.

      + The SSPM MIB to generate synthetic application
      transactions by importing the appLocalIndex from the
      APM MIB.



5.3 Application Directory and appLocalIndex

      APM, TPM and related applications collect certain
      types of statistics for each application or applica-
      tion verb they are decoding. Some applications and
      application verbs are defined in the protocol direc-
      tory and thus get their own protocolID and a corre-
      sponding protocolDirLocalIndex. Other application
      verbs are defined more dynamically by entries in the
      apmHttpFilterTable or apmUserDefinedAppTable. These
      dynamically defined applications don't have proto-
      colDirID's assigned to them

      The APM MIB [APM] defines an important index called
      the appLocalIndex. For all application monitoring in
      the APM and TPM MIBs, applications are identified by
      integer values of the appLocalIndex. However, there is
      no single registry of applications (as there is for
      protocols) because there are a few different mecha-
      nisms through which an application may be registered.
      For each value of appLocalIndex, a corresponding entry
      will exist in one of several tables:

         1. The protocolDirTable - Some values of appLocalIndex
            correspond to protocolDirLocalIndex values assigned in the
            protocolDirTable. Each of these corresponds to a protocol defined
            by a protocolID.
         2. The apmHttpFilterTable - Some values of appLocalIndex correspond
            to apmHttpFilterAppLocalindex values assigned in the
            apmHttpFilterTable. Each of these corresponds to an application
            verb defined as a set of HTTP transactions that match a set of
            filters.
         3. The apmUserDefinedAppTable - Some values of appLocalIndex
            correspond to index values of the apmUserDefinedAppTable. Each
            of them correspond to an application or application verb defined
            in a user-defined way.

      Each value of appLocalIndex will only be registered in



RMON MIB WG         Expires November 2003          [Page 22]





INTERNET DRAFT      Introduction to RMON            May 2003


      one of these tables. In effect, the appLocalIndex num-
      ber space is the union of these number spaces, where
      these tables must work together to avoid assigning
      overlapping (duplicate) appLocalIndexes.

      Each unique appLocalIndex value is also registered in
      the apmAppDirectoryTable where a number of attributes
      of the application may be configured.

5.4 Data Source

      Most RMON functions use a DataSource as a pointer to
      the entity from which data is to be collected. The
      DataSource is an object identifier that identifies one
      of three types of data sources:

        ifIndex.<I>

            Traditional RMON dataSources. Called 'port-
            based' for ifType.<I> not equal to 'propVir-
            tual(53)'. <I> is the ifIndex value.

        smonVlanDataSource.<V>

            A dataSource of this form refers to a 'Packet-
            based VLAN' and is called a 'VLAN-based' data-
            Source. <V> is the VLAN ID as defined by the
            IEEE 802.1Q standard. The value is between 1 and
            4094 inclusive, and it represents an 802.1Q
            VLAN-ID with global scope within a given bridged
            domain, as defined by 802.1Q.

        entPhysicalEntry.<N>

            A dataSource of this form refers to a physical
            entity within the agent and is called an
            'entity-based' dataSource. <N> is the value of
            the entPhysicalIndex in the entPhysicalTable.


5.5 Capabilities

      Probe Capabilities objects have been introduced in the
      RMON MIB modules with the goal of helping applications
      determine the capabilities of the different probes in
      the domain. These objects use a BITS syntax (with the



RMON MIB WG         Expires November 2003          [Page 23]





INTERNET DRAFT      Introduction to RMON            May 2003


      exception of some of the objects in the TPM and SSPM
      MIBs), and list in an explicit manner the MIB groups
      supported by the probe, as well as functional capabil-
      ities of the specific RMON agents. By reading the val-
      ues of these objects it is possible for applications
      to know which RMON functions are usable without going
      through a trial-and-error process that can result in
      loss of time and bandwidth in the operational flow.
      These objects have the MAX-ACCESS of read-only, which
      defines their use as an indication of what is sup-
      ported by a probe, and not a means to configure the
      probe for operational modes. An RMON agent SHOULD ini-
      tiate the capabilities objects at agent initialization
      and SHOULD NOT modify the objects during operation.

      The probeCapabilities object in the RMON2 MIB
      describes the capabilities of probes that support
      RMON, Token-Ring RMON and RMON2.

      The smonCapabilities object in the SMON MIB describes
      the SMON-specific capabilities of probes that support
      the SMON MIB.

      The dataSourceCapsTable in the SMON MIB defines the
      capabilities of the SMON data sources on probes that
      support the RMON MIB.

      The interfaceTopNCaps object in the Interface TopN MIB
      defines the sorting capabilities supported by an agent
      that supports the Interface TopN MIB.

      The dsmonCapabilities object in the DSMON MIB provides
      an indication of the DSMON groups supported by an
      agent that supports the DSMON MIB.

      The tpmCapabilitiesGroup contains objects and tables,
      which show the measurement protocol and metric capa-
      bilities of an agent that supports the TPM MIB.

      The sspmCapabilitiesTable indicates whether a device
      supporting the SSPM MIB supports SSPM configuration of
      the corresponding AppLocalIndex.

      The hcAlarmCapabilities object provides an indication
      of the high capacity alarm capabilities supported by
      an agent that supports the HC-Alarm MIB.

5.6 Control Tables

      Due to the complex nature of the available functions
      in the RMON MIB modules, these functions often need
      user configuration.  In many cases, the function
      requires parameters to be set up for a data collection
      operation.  The operation can proceed only after these
      parameters are fully set up.

      Many functional groups in the RMON MIBs have one or
      more tables in which to set up control parameters, and
      one or more data tables in which to place the results
      of the operation.  The control tables are typically
      read-write in nature, while the data tables are typi-
      cally read-only.  Because the parameters in the con-
      trol table often describe resulting data in the data
      table, many of the parameters can be modified only
      when the control entry is invalid.  Thus, the method
      for modifying these parameters is to invalidate the
      control entry, causing its deletion and the deletion
      of any associated data entries, and then create a new
      control entry with the proper parameters.  Deleting
      the control entry also gives a convenient method for
      reclaiming the resources used by the associated data.

      To facilitate control by multiple managers, resources
      have to be shared among the managers.  These resources
      are typically the memory and computation resources
      that a function requires.

      Two facilities are used to ease cooperation between
      multiple managers as they create and use control
      tables. The first is the use of EntryStatus or RowSta-
      tus objects that guarantee that two managers can avoid
      creating the same control entry. The second is the use
      of OwnerString objects in control tables that provides
      the following benefits:

        1. Provides information to facilitate sharing of already existing
           control entries instead of creating a new but identical entry.
        2. Provides information to allow the ultimate human owners of
           control entries to identify each other so they can cooperate in
           cases of conflict over resources.
        3. Provides information to allow software to identify control
           entries that it owns but has forgotten about (e.g., due to a
           crash or other error) so that it can re-use or free them.

        4. Provides information to allow an administrator to make an
           informed decision to override someone else's control entry when
           circumstances make it necessary.
        5. Provides information to identify control entries that are set up
           automatically when the device starts up.

      the use of control tables, EntryStatus/RowStatus, and

6. Relationship of the SSPM MIB with the APM and TPM MIBs

      While APM and TPM may monitor actual traffic generated
      by end-users on the network, they may also monitor
      synthetically generated traffic. The SSPM MIB provides
      a mechanism for the generation of synthetic traffic
      but no mechanism for monitoring - the task of monitor-
      ing the generated traffic is deferred to the APM and
      TPM MIBs.

      Figure 5 below shows an overview of the components of
      the SSPM MIB architecture including the roles played
      by the APM and TPM MIBs.  The RMON documents address
      the "Control-Level" in this diagram and some aspects
      of the "Synchronization Control-Level".  The underly-
      ing "Instrumentation-Level" is implementation depen-
      dent and outside the domain of the RMON specifica-
      tions.

               Figure 5: An SSPM Performance Monitoring System

   It is the responsibility of the network management appli-
   cation to coordinate the individual aspects of the per-
   formance management system.

   Within the APM, TPM, and SSPM set of RMON MIB modules:

      + APMMIB [APM] is responsible for the aspects of the
      "Monitoring Metrics Control" directly related to the
      end-user's perceived application-level performance.
      The APMMIB also handles aspects of "Data Reduction
      Control" and "Reports".  Finally, when TPMMIB relies
      upon the control tables in the APMMIB for its own con-
      trol, then APMMIB is providing some aspects of "Syn-
      chronization Control" of the reports from these two
      MIBs.

      + TPMMIB [TPM] is responsible for the aspects of the
      "Monitoring Metrics Control".  TPMMIB also handles
      aspects of "Data Reduction Control" and "Reports"
      related to

      sub-application-level transactions.  Synchronization
      control with APMMIB is provided by opting to rely on
      the APMMIB control tables within the TPMMIB.

      + SSPMMIB [SSPM] is responsible for the "Traffic Gen-
      eration Control" in the event that synthetic traffic
      is to be monitored.  The other, most common, option is
      to monitor natural, user-generated traffic.

   The "Monitor Metrics Control" is essentially hard-coded
   in the APMMIB.  Within the TPMMIB, a metrics table is
   used to identify the metrics monitored within a specific
   implementation of the TPMMIB.  The "Data Reduction Con-
   trol" is essentially hard-coded within the MIB structure
   of the APMMIB and the TPMMIB.  These MIBs strictly spec-
   ify the statistics to be reported within a set of report
   tables.

   Both the TPMMIB and the SSPMMIB rely upon the APMMIB's
   appLocalIndex to specify the application being monitored
   or generated.  The APMMIB provides the end-user view of

   the application performance, e.g., the Whois transaction
   time.  The TPMMIB, through its tpmTransMetricDirTable,
   identifies a set of sub-application level transactions
   and their metrics, which are associated with the applica-
   tion.  E.g, an implementation of the TPMMIB could report
   the DNS lookup time, the TCP connect time (to the Whois
   Server), the Whois Req/Resp download time.  The SSPMMIB
   could be configured to generate synthetically, these
   Whois transactions.

   The testing model then is to first configure the traffic
   generation instrumentation through the SSPMMIB control
   function.  This defines aspects of the synthetic traffic
   such as application type, targets,

   etc.  Once the traffic generation is configured, the net-
   work management application can setup the monitoring
   instrumentation through the APMMIB and TPMMIB.  These
   control the reporting periods, the type of data aggrega-
   tion, etc.  Once the tests are complete, the network man-
   agement application retrieves the reports from the moni-
   toring metrics control MIBs, e.g., APMMIB and TPMMIB.
