                           Internet Drafts and RFC's 
     Overview 
         
        This document describes the steps to create a Microsoft Word 97 or 
        later template to assist those producing Internet drafts. The 
        resulting configuration allows for simple WYSIWYG editing of drafts 
        and RFCs while producing output that is in accordance with IETF 
        draft and RFC submission specifications. (72 Characters per line, 58 
        lines per page, each line terminated by a CRLF, and each page 
        followed by a LF, etc.) Using Word's text justification and table 
        capabilities may facilitate creating ASCII stick drawings. 
         
        While the authors happen to have been employed by Microsoft during 
        much of this document's evolution, it is not a product of Microsoft 
        and is unsupported.  
         
        Included is a detailed description of how the RFC Text and RFC 
        Heading styles are defined. This should prove useful to those 
        wishing to do further customization work or create a similar 
        template for other versions of Microsoft Word. 
         
        It also includes a description and the source of the CRLF.EXE 
        program that is used to create the final text file output. Feedback 
        about this program is consistent with the fact that each version of 
        Windows has a slightly different Generic Printer driver. Since this 
        document will not be kept current with every Windows revision, the 
        code sample is provided as a basis for personal customizations.  
         
        A copy of the template in RTF format and the CRLF.EXE program, can 
        be found at ftp://ftp.ietf.org/internet-drafts 
         
         
     Conventions used in this document 
         
        In this document the steps for walking a pull-down tree are indented 
        on subsequent lines. This allows abbreviation rather than a barrage 
        of 'then click' or 'select' strings in a paragraph form. Example: 
         
        Help 
           About Microsoft Word 
         
     Instructions for producing Internet drafts and RFCs 
         
        1) The "auto-formatting" Microsoft Word does can result in some 
        undesired characters when creating the IETF standardized format. 
        (E.g. it will insert special characters for quotation marks, add 
        special formatting when creating lists, etc.)  To avoid this, turn 
        off "auto formatting"  
        Tools 
           Autocorrect   
        On the property pages 'AutoFormat' and 'AutoFormat As You Type', 
        turn off all of the auto formatting options. If you forget, or 
        frequently switch between IETF format and not, typing a ^Z after 
        each auto-format event will undo the formatting change. This of 
        course requires awareness of the event.

                           Internet Drafts and RFC's 
         
        2) Two special styles need to be defined: RFC Heading and RFC Text. 
        If you choose automatic reference numbering or table of contents 
        (defined below), the style for Endnote Reference, Endnote Text, and 
        TOC need to be modified.  The entire draft must be written using 
        these styles for the spacing to come out correctly.   
         
        *** Do not use bold, underlining, italics, etc., or you will loose 
        the WYSIWYG editing feature since these settings affect the number 
        of characters that can occur on a line. When the resulting Internet 
        draft is saved as plain text, all that formatting will be lost 
        anyway. *** 
         
        3) Print the document to the Generic Text Printer, and save the 
        output to file.  If you do not have the Generic Text Printer driver 
        installed, install it from the Control Panel. (Printers, Add 
        Printer, local/My Computer, any LPT port (you will be printing to a 
        file), select Generic, Generic/Text Only from the combo box). When 
        you print to a file a pop-up will ask for the file name. 
         
        4) Run the CRLF program to automatically add carriage returns. 
                  Usage is CRLF <source> <destination> 
        Where <source> is the name of the file produced by printing to the 
        generic text printer, and <destination> is the name of the text 
        draft you are producing. Example: crlf draft-00.prn draft-00.txt 
         
     Defining Microsoft Word Page Layout and Styles 
         
        These are settings used to define the RFC Text and RFC Heading 
        styles. Note: the menu options to set these are enclosed in 
        parenthesis and are listed for Microsoft Word 97.  They may differ 
        slightly for other versions of Microsoft Word. 
         
        1) Set measurement units to points. 
        Tools 
           Options 
              General 
                 Measurement units = points 
         
        2) Set margins as follows: (File, Page Setup, Margins) 
        Top:         24 pts  
        Bottom:      0 pts 
        Left:        36 pts 
        Right:       57.6 pts 
        Gutter:      0 pts 
        Header:      0 pts 
        Footer:      0 pts 
         
        The right margin is what determines 72 characters per line. Using 12 
        pt font, 10 chars/inch, 72 chars = 7.2".  Using paper that is 8.5" 
        wide. 8.5" - 7.2" = 1.3" = 93.6 pts   If you get "one or more 
        margins are outside the printable area" message, select Ignore. This 
        seems to depend on the printer you currently have selected.

                           Internet Drafts and RFC's 
        While early versions of this document set the left and right margins 
        to 0 and 93.6, there were reports that this occasionally cut off 
        characters on the left. Shifting the text right results in the 
        margins given here. Just be sure to move both in equal increments. 
         
        3) Set paper size as follows: 
        File 
           Page Setup  
              Paper Size 
                     Width:  612 pt (8.5") 
                     Height: 696 pt (12pt * 58 lines per page) 
        The height of the paper is what determines 58 lines per page. 
         
        4) Set headers/footers to be different for the first page.  
        File 
           Page Setup 
              Layout 
         
        5) Define a RFC Heading Style. 
        Format 
           Style 
              New 
        RFC Heading: Heading1 + Font:  Courier New, 12pt, Not Bold, Line 
        spacing exactly 12pt., Space before 0 pt after 0 pt, Level 1 
         
        NOTE: Line Spacing Exactly 12pt is very important. Set this through 
        Format: Paragraph 
         
        Additional Heading levels can be defined by repeating this step and 
        incrementing the Level #. If Numbered Headings are desired: 
        Format 
           Bullets and Numbering 
              Outline Numbered 
                 Select preferred style 
                    Customize 
                       More 
                          Link level to style RFC Heading 
         
        6) Define a RFC Text Style. 
        Format 
           Style 
              New 
        RFC Text: Normal+Font: Courier New, 12pt, Indent: Left 21.6pt, Line 
        Spacing Exactly 12 pt. 
         
        Line Spacing and indent are set through Format, Paragraph.  This 
        leaves a 3 character left indent for the RFC text 
         
        7) Fix the Header Style. 
        Format  
           Style

        Header:  Normal+Font: Courier New, 12pt, Line Spacing Exactly 12 pt, 
        Clear the tabs previously defined, and add Tabs 252 pt Centered, 504 
        pt Right Flush 
         
        8) Fix the Footer Style.

        Tabs 252 pt Centered, 504 pt Right Flush 
         
        9) Define your headers and footers for the first page. 
        View  
           Headers 
              (on first page) 
        Header: No Header 
        Footer:  Carriage Return 
        AuthorName <tab> <tab> [Page <page number field>] 
         
        10) Define subsequent headers and footers. 
        View  
           Headers  
              (on second page) 
        Header: <tab> Title <tab> Month, Year 
        Footer:  Carriage Return 
        AuthorName <tab> Expiration <tab> [Page <page number field>] 
         
        11) Fix the Table-of-contents Styles. Repeat for each level. 
        Format 
           Style 
              TOC1 
        TOC1: RFC text +, Automatically update 
        TOC2: RFC text + Indent: Left 0.14", Automatically update 
        TOC3: RFC text + Indent: Left 0.28", Automatically update 
         
     Positioning the document identifiers on the first page 
         
        The 'Table' tool can be used to assist with justification of the 
        document identifiers on the first page. Each cell in the table 
        maintains its own justification characteristics, so getting left and 
        right justification on the same line is simplified. On the Toolbar 
        select the icon that looks like a grid with a dark bar across the 
        top. This will pop-up a table array. Drag the mouse across to select 
        the number of rows and columns (for the opening header 4 rows x 2 
        columns, unless there are several authors). Select the table that 
        was just inserted by click-and-hold in the left margin, and then 
        clear the boarders.  
        Format 
           Borders and Shading 
              None 
        Select the cells on the right (position the cursor just above the 
        top cell, when the cursor becomes an arrow pointing down, click) and 
        set justification right. (The default is to take justification from

        Move the center divider to the right if necessary for the document 
        title. Select the left column of cells, then position the cursor 
        over the dividing line. When it changes to parallel bars with 
        right/left arrows, click-and-hold, then drag the line as necessary. 
         
     Automatic date 
         
        For those who frequently update drafts, and find they occasionally 
        forget to update the current save and expire dates, there is a way 
        to automate those fields. While it is rather complex to set up the 
        expire-month field, it only needs to be done once in a template 
        file, and all future drafts benefit. 
         
        To automatically set the current date on save, select the lower 
        right cell in the table created above, and insert the save date. 
        Insert 
           Field 
             Date and Time 
                SaveDate 
                     In the box below the sample "field codes", modify as 
                     necessary to make it look like:  
                     - SAVEDATE \@ "MMMM YYYY" û (between the û's).  
                OK 
         
        The field will have a gray background on the screen, but will not 
        affect the printed version. Double click on the field, copy, and 
        then replace the Month, Year in the header (10 in Layout Styles 
        above) with a paste.  
         
        Setting up the expire-date is similar, but requires inserting nested 
        fields. Select the location for the month then insert an IF field. 
        Insert 
           Field 
             MailMerge 
               IF 
                 OK 
         
        This will result in an error. Right click on the error message, and 
        select Toggle Field Codes. This will allow further editing. Select 
        the space after the initial IF, then insert another field: SaveDate 
        (as above but this time only the month digit is used "M"). Right 
        click on the number it inserts and Toggle Field Codes again. Follow 
        the right brace } with =, then the month to test, followed by the 
        month name 6 months later. At this point loop and insert another IF, 
        until all 12 are done. Follow the last one with a "" to complete the 
        syntax. The resulting expanded filed code will look like:

        SAVEDATE  \@ "M" \* MERGEFORMAT } = 11 May { IF { SAVEDATE  \@ "M" 
        \* MERGEFORMAT } = 12 June "" \* MERGEFORMAT } \* MERGEFORMAT } \*

        MERGEFORMAT } \* MERGEFORMAT } \* MERGEFORMAT } \* MERGEFORMAT } \* 
        MERGEFORMAT } \* MERGEFORMAT } 
         
        Space over and set the expire-year with a field in a similar manner. 
        This time there are only 2 IF fields, comparing halves of the year. 
        The printed value on true will be the SaveDate year value and the 
        expanded result will look like: 
         
        { IF { SAVEDATE \@ "M" \* MERGEFORMAT } < 7 { SAVEDATE \@ "YYYY" \* 
        MERGEFORMAT } { IF { SAVEDATE \@ "M" \* MERGEFORMAT } > 6 { = { 
        SAVEDATE \@ "YYYY" \* MERGEFORMAT } + 1 \*MERGEFORMAT } "" \* 
        MERGEFORMAT } 
         
        Revert the field codes to normal text by right click, Toggle Field 
        Codes or Update Field. Select both of these fields by clicking on 
        one then shift click on the other. Copy, then paste in the footer (9 
        & 10 in Layout Styles above) replacing the Month, Year.  
         
     Automatic reference numbering 
         
        To support automatic updates of reference numbers, make the 
        following changes. (Requires the document to be a single section 
        prior to the Reference heading.) 
         
        1) Insert a section break on the line after Reference heading.

        Final fixup: the CRLF program 
         
        Each line needs to be terminated by a CRLF, but when printing your 
        document to the Generic Text Printer driver, some blank lines will 
        be terminated only with a line feed. Consider a traditional text 
        line printer, printing a line of text, followed by 3 blank lines.  
        The output would look as follows: 
         
        Line of Text<CR><LF><LF><LF>. 
         
        This was done because there was no need to move the print carriage 
        head for the blank lines, only line feeds were necessary. 
         
        CRLF.EXE is a Win16/32 program to fix up the output from the various 
        versions of the Generic Text Printer driver so that each line is 
        terminated by a CRLF.  An extra line that makes the first page be 59 
        lines, instead of the required 58 is also removed.   
         
        Following example provides source for a CRLF fixup program.

        Known problems 
         
        Printing 
         
        If you try to print the draft you are working on from within 
        Microsoft Word to an actual printer (not to a file using the Generic 
        Text printer driver), you may receive an error message indicating 
        the margins are outside of the printable area of the printer.  If 
        you continue printing, the first 2 characters of each heading will 
        be truncated.  It is recommended you produce a printed copy of the 
        draft you are working on by using the CRLF program to produce a text 
        file, and then redirect it to a printer (so that you do not need to 
        deal with other programs like NOTEPAD, etc. adding their own 
        margins.) Example:  
         
        - Print to a file using the generic text printer 
        - CRLF draft.prn draft.txt 
        - NET USE lpt1 <\\printername\sharename> 
        - TYPE draft.txt > LPT1 
         
        As an alternative, if the final draft.txt file is opened with Word, 
        setting all 4 margins to .65" will position it on the page. 
        File 
           Page Setup 
              Top    .65 
              Bottom .65 
              Left   .65 
              Right  .65 
         
        The Underscore character 
         
        If you use the underscore character "_" within the RFC Text and RFC 
        Heading style, it will not be displayed on most screens.  (It 
        appears as a blank space.)  It will print correctly and will appear 
        as an underscore character in the final draft output. 
      
         
     Formal Syntax 
         
        The formal definition of RFC format is defined in RFC-2223 [1] and 
        Internet Draft instructions are available at [2]. 
         
         
     Security Considerations 
      
        Caution is advised when opening any document that may contain a 
        macro virus. The template files originally provided to the Internet-
        drafts & RFC editors did not contain any macros, and unless tampered 
        with should not now. If there are concerns about using the template 
        doc file, the instructions provided here will allow creation of one 
        from scratch. Further details about Microsoft Word macro virus 
        concerns are available at: http://www.microsoft.com/ . To find the 
        current documents, search for 'macro virus'.
