                   Anti-Spam Requirements on an SMTP MTA

Abstract

   This memo gives a number of technical requirement on SMTP [1] MTAs
   (Mail Transfer Agents, e.g. sendmail) to make them more capable of
   reducing the impact of spam(*).

   The intent is that these requirements will help clean up the spam
   situation, if applied on enough SMTP MTAs on the Internet, and that
   they should be used as guidelines for the various MTA vendors. We are
   fully aware that this is not the final solution, but if these
   requirements were included, and used, on all Internet SMTP MTAs,
   things would improve considerably and give time to design a more long
   term solution. Some ideas are presented in the Future Work section.

   A brief summary of this memo is:

   o   Stop unauthorized mail relaying.
   o   Spammers then have to operate in the open; deal with them.
   o   Design a mail system that can handle spam.

1. Introduction

   This memo is intended to become a Best Current Practice (BCP) RFC.
   As such it should be used as a guideline for SMTP MTA vendors to make
   their products more capable of preventing/handling spam.

1.1. Background

   Mass unsolicited electronic mail, often known as spam(*), has
   increased considerably during a short period of time and has become a
   serious threat to the Internet email community as a whole. Something
   needs to be done fairly quickly.

   The problem has several components:

   o   It is high volume, i.e. people get a lot of such mail in their
       mailboxes.

   o   It is completely "blind", i.e. there is no correlation between
       the receivers' areas of interest and the actual mail sent out
       (at least if one assumes that not everybody on the Internet is
       interested in porno pictures and spam programs...).

   o   It costs real money for the receivers. Since many receivers
       pay for the time to transfer the mailbox from the (dialup) ISP
       to their computer they in reality pay real money for this.

   o   It costs real money for the ISPs. Assume one 10 Kbyte message
       sent to 10 000 users with their mailboxes at one ISP host;
       that means an unsolicited, unexpected, storage of 100 Mbytes.
       State of the art disks, 4 Gbyte, can take 40 such message
       floods before they are filled. It is almost impossible to
       plan ahead for such "storms".

   o   Several of the senders are anything but serious, e.g hide
       behind false addresses or mail hosts that refuse to receive.

       In fact many of the spam-programs show a pride in adding
       false info that will "make the ISPs scratch their heads".

       It is not uncommon that people who send in protests (often
       according to the instructions in the mail) find their mail
       addresses added to more lists and sold to other parties.

   o   It is quite common practice to make use of third party hosts
       as relays to get the spam mail sent out to the receivers. This
       is almost certainly illegal in all countries, but with the
       original sender in the US, the (innocent) relay in Sweden and

draft-lindberg-anti-spam-mta-01.txt                          16 Dec 1997


       the list of receivers back in the US the legal aspects become
       almost overhelming.

1.2. Scope

   This memo has no intent to be the final solution to the spam problem.

   If, however, enough Internet MTAs did implement enough of the rules
   described below (especially the Non-Relay rules), we would get the
   spammers out in the open, where they could be taken care of. Either
   pure legal actions would help, or we can block them technically using
   other rules described below (since the Non-Relay rules now make them
   appear openly, with their own hosts and domains, we can apply various
   access filters against them). In reality, a combination of legal and
   technical methods is likely to give the best result.

   This way, the spam problem could be reduced enough to allow the
   Internet community to design and deploy a real and general solution.

1.3. Terminology

   Throughout this memo we will use the terminology of RFC2119, [4]:

   o   "MUST"

       This word or the adjective "REQUIRED" means that the item is
       an absolute requirement.

   o   "SHOULD"

       This word or the adjective "RECOMMENDED" means that there may
       exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore
       this item, but the full implications should be understood and
       the case carefully weighed before choosing a different course.

   o   "MAY"

       This word or the adjective "OPTIONAL" means that this item is
       truly optional.  One vendor may choose to include the item
       because a particular marketplace requires it or because it
       enhances the product, for example; another vendor may omit
       the same item.

1.4. Using DNS information

   In the memo we sometimes suggest use of host or domain names, FQN,
   rather than IP addresses. This is because FQN are intuitively much
   easier to use.



Lindberg et.al.  Anti-Spam Requirements on an SMTP MTA          [Page 3]

draft-lindberg-anti-spam-mta-01.txt                          16 Dec 1997


   However, all such usage depends heavily on DNS and .IN-ADDR.ARPA
   information. Since it is fairly easy to forge that, either by false
   cache information injected in DNS servers or spammers running their
   own DNS, host and domain names must be used with care, e.g. verify
   that the translation address->name corresponds to name->address.

1.5. SMTP Return Codes

   Our basic assumption is that refuse/accept is handled at the SMTP
   layer and that an MTA that decides to refuse a message should do so
   while still in the SMTP dialogue. First, this means that we do not
   have to store a copy of a message we later decide to refuse and
   second, our responsibility for that message is low or none - since we
   have not yet read it we leave it to the sender to handle the error.

   SMTP has several classes of Return Codes, see [1] for a discussion:

   o   5xx
       is a Fatal Error and results in the mail transfer being
       terminated and the mail returned to sender. For some events,
       like "Denied - you're on the spammer's list", this is
       probably the correct response and the right thing to say.

       A mistake in configuration, however, may cause valid mail to
       bounce back to the sender, which may be quite unfortunate.

   o   4xx
       is a Temporary Error and results in the mail transfer being
       put back on queue again and a new attempt being made later.
       Therefore, configuration mistakes are much less fatal and you
       may correct them before any real damage is done.

       A 4xx response also makes the spammer's host re-queue the mail
       and if it really is his own host who gets to do this, it is
       probably a good thing. If, on the other hand, he is using
       someone else as Relay Host, all the mail being queued is a
       fairly strong evidence that something illegal is going on and
       should cause attention at the Relay Host.

   4xx, Temporary Error, is almost always the recommended Return Code,
   since it both allows us to correct our mistakes and keeps the spam
   mail in the mail queue at the sender for a longer period of time.

   However, 4xx Temporary Errors may have unexpected interaction with
   MX-records. If the receiving domain has several MX records and the
   lowest preference MX-host refuses to receive mail from a certain
   "MAIL From" domain with a "451" Response Code, the sending host may
   choose to - and often will - use the next host on the MX list.

draft-lindberg-anti-spam-mta-01.txt                          16 Dec 1997


   If that next MX host does not have the same refuse-list, it will of
   course accept the mail, only to find that the final host still
   refuses to receive that piece of mail ("MAIL From"). I.e. our intent
   was to make the offending mail stay at the offending sender's host
   and fill up his mqueue disk, but it all ended up at our friend, the
   next lowest preference MX-host.

2. Requirements

   Here we first give a brief list of requirements, followed by a more
   thorough discussion of each of them.

   1)  MUST be able to restrict unauthorized use as Mail Relay.

   2)  MUST provide "Received:" lines with enough information to
       make it possible to trace the mail path, despite spammers use
       forged host names in HELO statements etc.

   3)  MUST provide local log information that makes it possible to
       trace the event afterwards.

   4)  MUST log all occurences of anti-relay/anti-spam actions.

   5)  SHOULD be able to refuse mail from a host / a group of hosts.

   6a) SHOULD be able to refuse mail from a specific "MAIL From"
       user, <foo@domain.example>.

   6b) SHOULD be able to refuse mail from an entire "MAIL From"
       domain <.*@domain.example>.

   7)  SHOULD be able to limit ("rate control") mail flow.

   8)  SHOULD be able to verify "MAIL From" domain (using DNS or
       using other means).

   9)  SHOULD be able to verify <local-part> in outgoing mail.

   10) MUST be able to configure for different Return Codes for
       different rules (e.g. 451 Temp Fail vs 551 Fatal Error).

   The discussion below often ends up in a need to do various forms of
   pattern matching, on domain/host names and on IP addresses/subnets.
   It is RECOMMENDED that the data/template for doing so may be supplied
   outside of the MTA, e.g. that the pattern matching rules be included
   in the MTA but that the actual patterns may be in an external file.
   It is also RECOMMENDED that the pattern matching rules (external
   file) may contain regular expressions, to give maximum flexibility.



Lindberg et.al.  Anti-Spam Requirements on an SMTP MTA          [Page 5]

draft-lindberg-anti-spam-mta-01.txt                          16 Dec 1997


   Of course all string matching on domain/host names MUST be non case
   sensitive. Since <local-part> may be case sensitive it may be natural
   to keep that here. However, since <sPAmMeR@domain.example> and
   <spammer@domain.example> is most probably the same user and since the
   string compares are used to refuse his messages, we suggest that
   <local-part> be compared non case sensitive too.

2.1. Restricting unauthorized Mail Relay usage

   Unauthorized usage of a host as Mail Relay means theft of the relay's
   resources and puts the owner's reputation at risk. It also makes it
   impossible to filter out or block spam without at the same time
   blocking legitimate mail.

   Therefore, the MTA MUST be able to control/refuse such Relay usage.

   In an SMTP session we have 3 elements, with a varying degree of
   trust:

   1)  "MAIL From:"              Easily and often forged.
   2)  "RCPT To:"                Correct, or at least intended.
   3)  "SMTP Caller" (host)      IP.src addr OK, FQN may be OK.

   Since 1) is so easily and often forged, we cannot depend on that at
   all to authorize usage of our host as Mail Relay.

   Instead, the MTA MUST be able to authorize Mail Relay usage based on
   a combination of:

   o   "RCPT To" address (domain).
   o   "SMTP Caller" FQN hostname.
   o   "SMTP Caller" IP address.

   The suggested algorithm is:

   a)  If "RCPT To" is one of "our" domains, local or a domain that
       we accept to forward to (alternate MX), then accept to Relay.

   b)  If "SMTP Caller" is authorized, either its IP.src or its FQN
       (depending on if you trust the DNS), then accept to Relay.

   c)  Else refuse to Relay.

   When doing a) you have to make sure all kinds of SMTP source routing
   (both the official [@a,@b:u@c] and the '%' hack) is either removed
   completely before the test, or is at least not taken into account.

   In all cases the configuration MUST support wild cards (for FQNs) and

draft-lindberg-anti-spam-mta-01.txt                          16 Dec 1997


   masks (for IP addresses), i.e. domain.example or *.domain.example;
   10.0.0.0/8 or 192.168.1.0/24.

   The configuration SHOULD allow for the decision/template data to be
   supplied by an external source, e.g. text file or dbm database. The
   decision/template SHOULD be allowed to contain regular expressions.

2.2. Received: lines

   The MTA MUST prepend a "Received:" line, [2], in the mail, with
   enough information to make it possible to trace the mail path by
   reading the mail headers themselves, even if spammers use bogus
   information in HELO statements etc.

   Such a "Received:" line MUST contain:

   o   The IP address of the caller.

   o   The 'date-time' as described in RFC822, [2], pp 18.

   It SHOULD contain:

   o   The FQN corresponding to the callers IP address.

   o   The argument given in the "HELO" statement.

   It is suggested that most other "Received:" fields described in
   RFC822 be included in the "Received:" lines.

   These requirements are deliberately stronger than RFC1023, [3].

2.3. Event logs

   The MTA MUST provide enough local log information to make it possible
   to trace the event. This includes most of the information put into
   the "Received:" lines, see above.

2.4. Log anti-relay/anti-spam actions

   The MTA MUST log all anti-relay/anti-spam actions. The log entries
   SHOULD contain at least:

   o   Time information.

   o   Refuse information, i.e. why the request was refused ("Mail
       From", "Relaying Denied", "Spam User", "Spam Host", etc).

   o   "RCPT To" addresses (domains).



Lindberg et.al.  Anti-Spam Requirements on an SMTP MTA          [Page 7]

draft-lindberg-anti-spam-mta-01.txt                          16 Dec 1997


   o   Offending host's IP address.

   o   Offending host's FQN hostname.

   o   Other relevant information (e.g. given during the SMTP
       dialogue, before we decided to refuse the request).

2.5. Refuse mail based on SMTP Caller address

   The MTA SHOULD be able to accept or refuse mail from a specific host
   or from a group of hosts. Here we mean the IP.src address or the FQN
   that its .IN-ADDR.ARPA resolves to (depending on whether your trust
   the DNS). This functionality could be implemented at a firewall, but
   since the MTA should be able to "defend itself" we require it here.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the MTA decide based on FQN hostnames
   (host.domain.example), on wild card domain names (*.domain.example),
   on individual IP addresses (10.11.12.13) or on IP addresses with a
   prefix length (10.0.0.0/8, 192.168.1.0/24).

   It is also RECOMMENDED that these decision rules can be combined to
   form a flexible list of accept/refuse/accept/refuse, e.g:

       accept   host.domain.example
       refuse   *.domain.example
       accept   10.11.12.13
       accept   192.168.1.0/24
       refuse   10.0.0.0/8

   IP-address/length is RECOMMENDED. However, implementations with wild
   cards, e.g. 10.11.12.* (classful networks on byte boundaries only)
   are of course much better then those without.

   To improve filtering even more, the MTA MAY provide complete regular
   expressions to be used for hostnames; possibly also for IP addresses.

2.6. Refuse based on "MAIL From"

   The MTA SHOULD be able to refuse to receive mail from a specific
   "MAIL From" user (foo@domain.example) or from an entire "MAIL From"
   domain (domain.example). In general this kind of rules are easily
   overcome by the spammers changing "MAIL From" every so often, but the
   ability to block a certain user or a certain domain is quite helpful
   while an attack has just been discovered and is ongoing.

2.7. Rate Control

   The MTA SHOULD provide tools for the mail host to control the rate



Lindberg et.al.  Anti-Spam Requirements on an SMTP MTA          [Page 8]

draft-lindberg-anti-spam-mta-01.txt                          16 Dec 1997


   with which mail is sent or received. The idea is twofold:

   1)  If we happen to have an legitimate mail user with an existing
       legitimate account and this user sends out spam, we may want
       to reduce the speed with which he sends it out. This is not
       without controversy and must be used with extreme care, but it
       may protect the rest of the Internet from him.

   2)  If we are under a spam attack it may help us considerably just
       being able to slow down the incoming mail rate for that
       particular user/host.

   For sending mail, this has to be done by throttling the TCP
   connection to set the acceptable output data rate, e.g. reduce the
   "write()" frequency.

   For receiving mail, we could use basically the same technique, e.g.
   reduce the "read()" frequency, or we could signal with a 4xx Return
   Code that we cannot receive. It is RECOMMENDED that the decision to
   take such action be based on "MAIL From" user, "MAIL From" domain,
   "SMTP Caller" (name/address) or a combination of all these.

2.8. Verify "MAIL From"

   The MTA SHOULD be able to perform a simple "sanity check" of the
   "MAIL From" domain and refuse to receive mail if that domain is
   nonexistent. To overcome temporary errors/problems in the DNS, 4xx
   Return Codes are strongly recommended; however the MTA MAY allow for
   Return Codes that show real DNS state - 4xx for temporary problems
   and 5xx for NonExistent domain.

   In all honesty, please note that this requirement and ability is a
   mixed blessing and should be used with extreme care.

   For early versions of spam spam software it does provide quite some
   relief, since that software generates mail with completely bogus
   "MAIL From" that will never even get into the system.

   On the other hand, sites with weak DNS connectivity may find their
   legitimate mail having problems reaching destinations due to DNS
   timeouts. However, since DNS information is handled asynchronously
   and is cached even though the initial requester has given up, chances
   are high that the necessary information is there at a later attempt.

   For later versions of spam software, a check of "MAIL From" is much
   less likely to help, since that software evolves too and will start
   using existing mail addresses (whether or not that is legal is beyond
   the scope of this memo). But, at least the Internet will benefit from



Lindberg et.al.  Anti-Spam Requirements on an SMTP MTA          [Page 9]

draft-lindberg-anti-spam-mta-01.txt                          16 Dec 1997


   the side effect that this test stops typos and misconfigured UAs.

2.9. Verify <local-part>

   The MTA SHOULD allow outgoing mail to have its <local-part> verified
   so that the sender name is a real user or an existing alias. This is
   basically to protect the rest of the Internet from various "typos"
       MAIL From <fo0bar@domain.example>
   and/or malicious users
       MAIL From <I.am.unknown.to.you.he.he@domain.example>

   As always this can be overcome by spammers really wanting to do so,
   but with more strict rules for relaying it becomes harder and harder.
   In fact, catching "typos" at the initial (and official) mail relay is
   in itself enough motivation for this requirement.

2.10. Return Codes

   The MTA MUST be configurable to use different Return Codes for
   different rules (e.g. 451 Temporary Failure vs 551 Fatal Error).
   Please refer to the previous section on SMTP Return Codes.

3. Future work

3.1. Impact on SMTP UAs

   Despite this memo is about MTAs and the requirements put on them,
   some of what is done here falls back to the UAs (User Agents, the
   "ordinary mail programs").

   A UA does two things:

   1)  Reads mail from a mailbox and prints on the screen.
       This typically uses a protocol like POP, IMAP or NFS.

   2)  Reads text from the keyboard and hands that over to the
       mailbox MTA for delivery as a piece of mail. This typically
       uses the SMTP protocol, i.e. the same protocol that is used
       between MTAs.

   When MTAs now start to implement various anti-relay filters as
   described above, a UA on a portable laptop host may get a response
   like "Relaying Denied" just because it happens to use IP addresses
   within the wrong range or "name". This could be resolved by some
   other mail-sending protocol between the US and the MTA.

   Or, we could note that when the SMTP Authentication work is all in
   place it will allow for Authenticated SMTP to serve as the protocol



Lindberg et.al.  Anti-Spam Requirements on an SMTP MTA         [Page 10]

draft-lindberg-anti-spam-mta-01.txt                          16 Dec 1997


   between the UAs and the home MTA (whether that should be considered a
   new protocol or "the same old SMTP" is irrelevant).

   This adds one item to the suggested Relay algorithm:

   +   If "SMTP Authenticated" then accept to Relay.

3.2. Personal anti-spam filters

   Since all users are individuals, there is little hope that any
   central anti-spam action will suit them all - in fact one could argue
   about Freedom of Speech if some central set of anti-spam rules is
   enforced without the users' approval (one could of course also argue
   whether spam really adds anything to anyone, but that must be up to
   each individual user rather than centrally decided).

   Therefore the only reasonable extension is to allow for personal
   anti-spam filters, i.e. anti-spam filters like the ones described
   earlier in this memo, but available and configurable on a per user
   basis. Since most users will not have a strong opinion (except that
   they want to avoid spam) the mail system should provide a system
   default and give each user the ability to override or modify that.
   In a UNIX based environment one could think of

       /etc/mail/rc.spam
       ~/.spamrc

   and rules on how the latter can interfere with the former.

   All of this opens up quite a number of unresolved issues, e.g.
   whether each user himself really should be allowed to decide on SMTP
   Return Codes (and how it should be described so he understands enough
   of the implications) and how existing mail systems will deal with
   different per user responses, especially how they will deal with a
   mix of 5xx and 4xx codes:

       C  MAIL From: <usr@spam.example>
       S  250 <usr@spam.example>... Sender ok
       C  RCTP To: <usr@domain.example>
       S  250 <usr@domain.example>... Recipient ok
       C  RCTP To: <foo@domain.example>
       S  451 <foo@domain.example>... Denied due to spam list
       C  RCTP To: <bar@domain.example>
       S  551 <bar@domain.example>... Denied due to spam list

   Of course one could decide on either "250 OK" or "551 Denied" with no
   other alternatives for the individual user, but this too has to be
   explained enough that an ordinary user understands the implications

draft-lindberg-anti-spam-mta-01.txt                          16 Dec 1997


   of "Refuse 'MAIL From: <.*@spam.example>'" and that it can do away
   with, or block out, mail he actually wanted.

3.3. SMTP Authentication

   SMTP Authentication has already been mentioned as a method to
   authorize Mail relaying, but of course there is much more to it than
   that. When that infrastructure and functionality is all in place,
   spammers will have a much harder time forging addresses and hiding.


3.4. ESMTP ContentType

   A lot of the problem with spam is actually that it is so completely
   "blind", without any relation to the receivers' personal interest and
   that there are no easy way to say No Thank You.

   One way things could evolve is that spam is taken care of by legal
   means, e.g. making it illegal to send unsolicited commercial email
   and make that happen world wide. Not very likely, but anyway.

   Another way would be to accept that spam/UCE will continue to exist,
   accept it legally (just like we accept the pile of paper mail that
   clutters up the paper mail mailbox) but require it be tagged as UCE.
   This would then go along the lines of personal anti-spam filters
   (~/.spamrc) where each user could define what kind of UCE he is
   willing to accept and then have an "ESMTP ContentType" code that
   could match his areas of interest, e.g:

       S  220 host.domain.example Ready
       C  HELO host.uce.example
       S  250 host.domain.example Hello host.uce.example
       C  ESMTP ContentType: UCE; money, porno
       S  250 ContentType accepted
       C  MAIL From: <uce@uce.example>
       S  250 <uce@uce.example>... Sender ok
       C  RCPT To: <foo@domain.example>
       S  250 <foo@domain.example>... Recipient ok
       C  RCPT To: <bar@domain.example>
       S  551 <bar@domain.example>... No thanks, not for me

   Besides all issues of entering more functionality into ESMTP, a major
   drawback with this idea is what to do with people claimimg

       ESMTP ContentType: mail; personal

   although it is really spam/UCE. This is a non technical issue that
   must be resolved, although that may be hard or even impossible.

4. Security Considerations

   The grassfire-like increase of spam raises several security issues
   which, in fact, puts the entire Internet mail community at risk:

   o   People may fail to find important mail in their flooded
       mailboxes. Or, they may delete it while cleaning up.

   o   ISPs get mailbox hosts overloaded and disk filled. Cleaning
       up and helping customers, require a lot of human resources.

   o   While disks are unaccessible, either due to being filled or
       due to "mail quota", important mail may be delayed or lost.
       Normally this would not happen without notice, but if both
       the sender and receiver hosts have their disk flooded, the
       mail being returned may also fail, i.e. the email service may
       become even less trustworthy then before.

   o   Hosts used as unauthorized Mail Relays get overloaded. Besides
       the technical implications, this too requires a lot of human
       resources, cleaning up mail queues and taking care of furious
       external users that were spammed through the Relay.

   o   The fight against spammers include blocking their hosts (which
       is described in this memo). However, there is a great risk
       that Mail Relay hosts be blocked too, despite they are also
       victims. In the long run, this may deteriorate Internet mail.

   o   The common use of forged "MAIL From" and "From:" addresses
       puts the blame on innocent persons/hosts/organizations. This
       is bad for reputation and may affect business relations.

5. Acknowledgements

   This memo is the result of discussions in an ad hoc group of Swedish
   ISPs and Universities. Without hope to mention everyone we simply
   give the domain names here: algonet.se, global-ip.net, pi.se,
   swip.net, telia.net, udac.se; chalmers.se, sunet.se, umu.se, and
   uu.se.

   We want to acknowledge valuable input and suggestions from Andras
   Salamon, John Myers, Bob Flandrena, Dave Presotto and Dave Kristol.

   *   spam (R) is a registered trademark of a meat product made by
       Hormel. Use of the term spam in the Internet community comes
       from a Monty Python sketch and is almost Internet folklore.
       The term spam is usually meant negative, however this is not
       in any way intended to describe the Hormel product.

Appendix A1. sendmail example

   The main purpose of the memo is to define a set of requirements that
   will help reduce spam. It is not intended to describe how to do that
   for any particular MTA. However, many of us use and are familiar with
   sendmail [5] and therefore we provide some hints; these require late
   versions of sendmail-8.8.* (when this was written, 16 Dec 1997,

   sendmail-8.8.8 was the latest). The example neither makes a claim to
   solve the problem nor to be correct and you use it at your own risk.

   These examples all use Return Code "451", Temp Fail. Please read that
   section above once more and verify that you will not hit your
   friends, your next lowest preference MX-hosts, that may have
   different rules.

   (NB sendmail makes a difference between <tab> and <space> used as
   separators; if you use cut-and-paste from this memo you are likely
   to get <space> everywhere).

   In the example below we use "CD" ("$=D") dual purpose, both for the
   domains (subdomains) we accept to relay into and the hosts that we
   accept use us as their Mail Relay. It is of course trivial to split
   that into two different classes, if needed.

   # In "class D" you enter domains and hosts for two purposes
   #   1) You accept to relay mail TO them (MX).
   #   2) You accept to relay mail FROM them (SmartHost).
   # In both cases, this is "recursive", i.e. foo.se -> *.foo.se
   #FD/etc/mail/sendmail.cD
   CD
   #
   # In "class B" you enter  the "exceptionally bad guys", i.e. hosts
   # that you want to deny relay from regardless - this may be hosts
   # that do not have enough filters or any other reason. Be careful.
