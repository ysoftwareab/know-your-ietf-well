Abstract

   This document defines two new configuration attributes for Internet
   Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2).  These attributes can be
   used for carrying the IPv4 address and IPv6 address of the Proxy-Call
   Session Control Function (P-CSCF).  When an IPsec gateway delivers
   these attributes to an IPsec client, the IPsec client can obtain the
   IPv4 and/or IPv6 address of the P-CSCF server located in the 3GPP
   network.

Internet-Draft          3GPP IMS Option for IKEv2             April 2015


1.  Introduction

   The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) S2b reference point
   [TS23402], specified by the 3GPP system architecture defines a
   mechanism for allowing a mobile node (MN) attached in an untrusted
   non-3GPP IP Access Network to securely connect to a 3GPP network and
   access IP services.  In this scenario, the mobile node establishes an
   IPsec ESP tunnel [RFC4303] to the security gateway called evolved
   packet data gateway (ePDG) and which in turn establishes a Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213] or GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP)
   [TS23402] tunnel to the packet data gateway (PGW) [TS23402] where the
   mobile node's session is anchored.

   The below figure shows the interworking option for non-3GPP access
   over an untrusted-access network.  The mobile access gateway (MAG)
   and the local mobility anchor (LMA) functions are defined in
   [RFC5213].  The ePDG and PGW functions are defined in [TS23402].
   IPsec ESP tunnel is between the MN and the ePDG and PMIP or GTP
   tunnel between the ePDG and the PGW.

           Figure 1: Exchange of IPv4 Traffic Offload Selectors

   A mobile node in this scenario may potentially need to access the IP
   Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) services in the 3GPP network [TS23228] and
   [TS24229].  Currently, there are no attributes in IKEv2 [RFC7296]
   that can be used for carrying these information elements.  In the
   absence of these attributes the mobile node needs to be statically
   configured with this information and this is proving to be an
   operational challenge.  Any other approaches such as using DNS, or
   DHCP for discovering these functions would result in obtaining

   configuration in the access network and not in the home network.
   Given that the above referenced 3GPP interface is primarily for
   allowing the mobile node to connect to the 3GPP network through an
   untrusted-access network, the access network may not have any
   relation with the home network provider and may be unable to deliver
   the mobile node's home network configuration.

   This specification therefore defines two new IKEv2 attributes
   [RFC7296] that allows an IPsec gateway to provide the IPv4 and/or
   IPv6 address of the P-CSCF server.  These attributes can be exchanged
   by IKEv2 peers as part of the configuration payload exchange.  The
   attributes follow the configuration attribute format defined in
   Section 3.15.1 of [RFC7296].  Furthermore, providing the P-CSCF
   server address(es) in IKEv2 as standard attribute(s) enables clients
   to directly access IMS services behind a VPN gateway without going
   through the 3GPP specific interfaces.


2.  Conventions and Terminology

2.1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.2.  Terminology

   All the IKEv2 related terms used in this document are to be
   interpreted as defined in [RFC7296] and [RFC5739].  All the mobility
   related terms are to interpreted as defined in [RFC5213] and
   [RFC5844].  Additionally, this document uses the following terms:

   Proxy-Call Session Control Function (P-CSCF)

      The P-CSCF is the entry point to the 3GPP IMS (IP Multimedia
      Subsystem) and serves as the SIP outbound proxy for the mobile
      node.  The mobile node performs SIP registration to 3GPP IMS and
      initiates SIP sessions via a P-CSCF.

   Evolved Packet Data Gateway (ePDG)

      Its is a security gateway defined by the 3GPP system architecture.
      The protocol interfaces it supports include IKEv2 [RFC7296].

   The P_CSCF_IP4_ADDRESS configuration attribute is formatted as
   follows:


    0                   1                   2                   3

   Reserved (1 bit)
      Refer to IKEv2 specification

   Attribute Type (15 bits)
      <IANA-1>

   Length (2 octets)
      Length of the IPv4 address field that follows.  Possible values
      are (0) and (4).  A value of (4) indicates the size of the 4-octet
      IPv4 address that follows.  A value of (0) indicates that its a
      empty attribute with zero-length IPv4 address field, primarily
      used as a request indicator.

   IPv4 Address (4 octets)
      An IPv4 address of the P-CSCF server.

   The P_CSCF_IP4_ADDRESS configuration attribute provides an IPv4
   address of a P-CSCF server within the network.  If an instance of an
   empty P_CSCF_IP4_ADDRESS attribute with zero-length IPv4 Address
   field is included by mobile node, the responder MAY respond with
   zero, one or more P_CSCF_IP4_ADDRESS attributes.  If several
   P_CSCF_IP4_ADDRESS attributes are provided in one IKEv2 message,
   there is no implied order among the P_CSCF_IP4_ADDRESS attributes.
   However, a system architecture using this specification may be able
   to enforce some order at both the peers.


4.  P_CSCF_IP6_ADDRESS Configuration Attribute

   The P_CSCF_IP6_ADDRESS configuration attribute is formatted as
   follows:

   Attribute Type (15 bits)
      <IANA-1>

   Length (2 octets)
      Length of the IPv6 address field that follows.  Possible values
      are (0) and (16).  A value is (16) indicates the size of the 16-
      octet IPv6 address that follows.  A value of (0) indicates that
      its a empty attribute with zero-length IPv6 address field,
      primarily used as a request indicator.

   IPv6 Address (16 octets)
      An IPv6 address of the P-CSCF server.

   The P_CSCF_IP6_ADDRESS configuration attribute provides an IPv6
   address of a P-CSCF server within the network.  If an instance of an
   empty P_CSCF_IP6_ADDRESS attribute with zero-length IPv6 Address
   field is included by mobile node, the responder MAY respond with
   zero, one or more P_CSCF_IP6_ADDRESS attributes.  If several
   P_CSCF_IP6_ADDRESS attributes are provided in one IKEv2 message,
   there is no implied order among the P_CSCF_IP6_ADDRESS attributes.
   However, a system architecture using this specification may be able
   to enforce some order at both the peers.


5.  Example Scenario

   The mobile node MAY request the IP address of an P-CSCF server as
   shown below.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires the following two IANA actions.

   o  Action-1: This specification defines a new IKEv2 attribute for
      carrying the IPv4 address of P-CSCF server.  This attribute is
      defined in Section 3.  The Type value for this Attribute needs to
      be assigned from the IKEv2 Configuration Payload Attribute Types
      namespace defined in [RFC7296].

   o  Action-2: This specification defines a new IKEv2 attribute for
      carrying the IPv6 address of P-CSCF server.  This attribute is
      defined in Section 4.  The Type value for this Attribute needs to
      be assigned from the IKEv2 Configuration Payload Attribute Types
      namespace defined in [RFC7296].

7.  Security Considerations

   This document is an extension to IKEv2 [RFC7296] and therefore it
   inherits all the security properties of IKEv2.

   The two new IKEv2 attributes defined in this specification are for
   carrying the IPv4 and IPv6 address of the P-CSCF server.  These
   attributes can be exchanged by IKE peers as part of the configuration
   payload and the currently defined IKEv2 security framework provides
   the needed integrity and privacy protection for these attributes.
   Therefore this specification does not introduce any new security
   vulnerabilities.
