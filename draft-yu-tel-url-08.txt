ABTRACT 
    
  This document proposes three parameters to the "tel" Uniform Resource 
  Locator for supporting number portability (NP) and freephone service.  
  Those proposed parameters allow the Session Initiation Protocol to 
  carry the tel URL or to convert the tel URL to the SIP URL so as to 
  support NP and freephone service.  The proposed parameters allow the 
  SIP protocol to be used to derive the routing number for the ported 
  geographical numbers, identify the freephone service provider/carrier 
  or the Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) number for a freephone 
  number, and carry the NP- and freephone-related information in the 
  SIP messages.

New Parameters for the "tel" URL to Support           November 19, 2003 
NP and Freephone Service 
 
1. Introduction 
    
   Number portability (NP)[2] allows the telephone subscribers to keep 
   their telephone numbers when they change service provider, move to a 
   new location, or change the subscribed services.  The NP 
   implementations in many countries presently support service provider 
   portability for geographic numbers and some non-geographical 
   numbers.  It has been identified that NP has impacts on several 
   works-in-progress at the IETF.  One of the impacts is the need to 
   carry the NP related information in the Session Initiation Protocol 
   (SIP)[3] INVITE message after the NP database dip has been 
   performed. 
    
   Freephone service allows the called party to pay for the call by 
   using special numbering blocks (e.g., 800, 888 and 877 number blocks 
   in the U.S.) and requiring a translation from the special numbers to 
   the Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) numbers.  For countries that 
   support freephone number portability using centralized databases to 
   manage the number porting, the originating network usually performs 
   a database dip to identify the freephone service provider/carrier 
   that serves a particular freephone number so that it can route the 
   freephone call to that freephone service provider/carrier.  If the 
   originating network is the freephone service provider for that 
   freephone number or is authorized by the freephone service 
   provider/carrier for that freephone number, it translates the 
   freephone number to a POTS number or some proprietary routing 
   information based on certain algorithms for call routing. 
    
   This document proposes three parameters to the "tel" Uniform 
   Resource Locator (URL)[4] for supporting NP and freephone service 
   allowing the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to carry the tel URL 
   or to convert the tel URL to the SIP URL.  The proposed parameters 
   may allow the SIP to be used to derive the routing number for the 
   ported geographical numbers, to identify the freephone service 
   provider/carrier or the Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) number 
   associate with a freephone number, and to carry the NP and 
   freephone-related information in the SIP messages. 
    
   Section 2 below lists the abbreviations used in this document.  
   Sections 3 and 4 describe the need for the parameters to the "tel" 
   URL to support NP and freephone service correspondingly, and those 
   proposed parameters are detailed in sections 5.  Section 6 gives a 
   few examples as to how those proposed parameters are used.  Section 
   7 discusses the signaling interworking between the IP-based network 
   and the traditional telephony network.  Section 8 is the conclusion.

3. NP Support 
    
   The NP-related information includes the dialed directory number, a 
   routing number, and an indicator that indicates whether a query to 
   the NP Database (NPDB) has been performed. 
    
   The dialed directory number may be needed at the terminating switch 
   so that the call can be terminated to the called party (e.g., a line 
   card).  The routing number allows the network, either the Global 
   Switched Telephone Network (GSTN) or the Internet Protocol (IP)-
   based network, to route the call to the network or switch that 
   currently serves the dialed directory number. In some NP 
   implementations, the routing number even identifies the line card 
   that is associated with the dialed directory number.  The NPDB dip 
   indicator informs the network entities downstream towards the 
   terminating network (e.g., the network that currently serves the 
   directory number) that NPDB dip has been performed; therefore, there 
   is no need to dip the NPDB again. 
    
   Since the dialed directory number is already present in the "tel" 
   URL before the NPDB dip is performed, it stays at the same place 
   (i.e., right after the "tel:").  Two new parameters are then 
   required to support NP.   
    
   The first parameter "rn," which stands for "routing number," carries 
   the routing number used for call routing.  This parameter can be 
   used to carry any routing number information that is different from

NP and Freephone Service 
 
   the directory number (e.g., carried right after the "tel:") even 
   when NP is not involved. 
    
   The second parameter "npdi," which stands for "NPDB dip indicator," 
   indicates whether NPDB dip has been performed.   
 
   These two new parameters are added to the "tel" URL to support NP. 
    
    
4. Freephone Service Support 
    
   The freephone-related information includes the dialed freephone 
   number, the carrier identification code (CIC) that identifies the 
   freephone service provider/carrier and the translated POTS number. 
    
   The dialed freephone number after number translation may need to be 
   passed to the called party for purposes such as customer account 
   management.  The CIC code is needed to identify the service 
   provider/carrier that is to receive and process the freephone call.  
   The translated POT number identifies the called party that is to 
   receive the call. 
    
   The translated POT number will be placed right after the "tel:" so 
   there is no need for a new parameter to carry it. 
 
   A new parameter "cic," which stands for carrier identification code, 
   identifies the freephone service provider/carrier associated with 
   the freephone number in question.  If a country uses the CIC codes 
   to identify the service providers/carriers that are not limited to 
   the freephone service providers/carriers, this new parameter can 
   also be used to identify those service providers/carriers even when 
   freephone service is not involved.   One example is the CIC dialed 
   by the caller for selecting a specific inter-exchange carrier in the 
   U.S. (e.g., 101XXXX). 
    
   "cic" is added to the "tel" URL as the third parameter. 
 
    
5. Proposed Parameters to the "tel" URL Scheme 
    
   The following parameters are to be added to the tel URL based on 
   Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)[5]:  
       
                             *1(routing-number) 
                             *1(npdb-dip-indicator)  
                             *1(carrier-id-code)                                    
    
   The proposed parameters are further described below. 
    
   routing-number          = ";rn=" global-rn / local-rn 
   global-rn               = "+" 1*phonedigit-hex 
   local-rn                = 1*phonedigit-hex   [context] 
   npdi-dip-indicator      = "npdi"

New Parameters for the "tel" URL to Support           November 19, 2003 
NP and Freephone Service 
 
   carrier-id-code         = "cic=" global-cic / local-cic 
   global-cic              = "+" 1*phonedigit-hex                                
   local-cic               = 1*phonedigit-hex   [cic-context] 
   cic-context             = ô;cic-context=ö descriptor                     
    
   The presence of ônpdiö indicates that NPDB dip has been performed.  
   If ônpdiö is not present, it indicates that either NPDB dip is not 
   yet performed or NP is not relevant. 
    
   The first 1-3 digits in the ôglobal-cicö identify a country code.  
   The rest of the digits identify a carrier ID code assigned in that 
   country. 
    
   The "rn," "npdi," and "cic" can appear at most once if present.  The 
   "cic," "rn" or ônpdiö may be removed when there is no need to carry 
   it further in the call signaling messages.  For example, when a 
   freephone call reaches the freephone service provider/carrier 
   serving that freephone number, the "cic" may no longer be needed 
   when the call is to be routed to the called party or another 
   network. Whether and when to remove the new parameters proposed in 
   this document are outside the scope of this document. 
    
   When the "rn" is present, the "npdi" may or may not be present.  
   This is because that the routing number may be present independent 
   of NP.  When the "npdi" parameter is not present, it indicates that 
   either NPDB dip has not been performed or NP is not relevant.  If a 
   SIP server is set to perform the NPDB queries and if a received 
   INVITE message does not contain the "npdi" parameter, it will 
   perform the NPDB query.  The NPDB query is outside the scope of this 
   document.  Please see [6] for using SIP to access the NP data.  The 
   routing number received in the response (converted to global- or 
   local-rn format) will replace the routing number in the "rn" 
   parameter if present or will be used by the new "rn" parameter if 
   "rn" parameter is not present.  The "npdi" parameter will be 
   included in this case.  The routing number can be a global routing 
   number (e.g., with "+" and the country code plus the national 
   number) or a local (e.g., network-specific) routing number.  It is 
   also possible that the SIP protocol can be used for the NP query.  
   In that case, the response (e.g., 302 Moved) to the SIP message may 
   carry the NP related information in the "tel" or "sip" URL format 
   with the parameters proposed in this document.   
    
   Although it may be very rare but it is possible to have the "cic," 
   "rn" and POTS number all in the same "tel" URL.  When all the three 
   are present, the "cic" is used for call routing.  A new address 
   family in the Telephony Routing Information Protocol (TRIP)[7] has 
   been defined for cic.  When only the "rn" and the POTS number are 
   present, the "rn" is used for making routing decisions (e.g., check 
   against the TRIP routing tables).  If the "cic" and "rn" parameters 
   are not present, the telephone number right after "tel:" is used for 
   call routing.  Please note that specific "cic" values can be 
   reserved to indicate call routing information instead of a valid CIC 
   that is assigned to a carrier.  For example, a "cic" value of "+1-

NP and Freephone Service 
 
   0110" in a response from the freephone database in the U.S. 
   indicates "local, translated number provided."  In this particular 
   case, the "cic" is ignored and the "rn" and the POTS number are used 
   for call routing based on the rules described above. 
    
   The "CICs" in the U.S. are assigned to entities that purchase 
   Feature Group B (FGB) or Feature Group D (FGD) access, FGB 
   translation access or are Local Exchange Carriers (LECs).  They are 
   also returned in the response to a freephone query for identifying 
   the freephone service provider that serves the queried freephone 
   number.  The North American Numbering Plan Administration (NANPA) 
   currently manages CIC assignment in the U.S. 
    
   The "CIC" can be expanded to include VoIP carriers and other types 
   of carriers in the same country or under the same country code so 
   that all carriers can be identified in the IP domain for routing 
   purpose.  International service providers and carriers can be 
   identified by the E.164 country codes for global services and for 
   Networks [8]. 
    
   Please see section 7 for the discussion on the signaling 
   interworking between the GSTN ISUP and SIP (e.g., "sip" or "tel" 
   URL). 
     
 
6. Examples 
 
6.1  NP Examples 
    
   To simplify the examples and focus on the "tel" URL in the Request-
   URI, only the key information of the Request-Line in a SIP INVITE 
   message is shown.  A SIP server receives an INVITE message as shown 
   below where +1-202-533-1234 is the dialed called party number and 
   has been ported out of the donor network. 
    
        INVITE tel:+1-202-533-1234  SIP/2.0 
    
   Assume that this SIP server is set to perform the NPDB query.  Since 
   this INVITE message does not contain the "npdi" parameter, this SIP 
   server will perform a NPDB query.  After receiving a successful 
   response back from the queried NPDB, it formulates the following SIP 
   INVITE message: 
    
        INVITE tel:+1-202-533-1234;rn=+1-202-544-0000;   
               npdi  SIP/2.0 
    
   This SIP server then uses the "rn" parameter to make the routing 
   decisions (e.g., using the routing number in the "rn" parameter to 
   check against the TRIP tables to determine the terminating GSTN 
   gateway).

New Parameters for the "tel" URL to Support           November 19, 2003 
NP and Freephone Service 
 
   The concept is that the "rn," if present, is used for making routing 
   decisions, and the phone number after "tel:" is used for call 
   routing only if the "rn" is not present. 
    
   If the dialed called party number +1-202-533-1234 is not ported, the 
   outbound SIP INVITE message may look like  
  
        INVITE tel:+1-202-533-1234;npdi  SIP/2.0 
 
   Please note that it may be legal to include the "rn" for carrying 
   the called party number in the example described above; however, it 
   is recommended not to include it because the called party number is 
   not the same as the routing number (e.g., the Location Routing 
   Number in the U.S.). 
    
 
6.2  Freephone Service Examples 
    
   To simplify the examples and focus on the "tel" URL, only the key 
   information of the Request-Line in a SIP INVITE message is shown.  A 
   SIP proxy server receives a call to a freephone number +1-800-123-
   4567.  After an interrogation with the freephone database, a CIC 
   with a value of =+1-6789 is received ("+1" is added if not present 
   in the response).  The CIC is used to route the freephone call 
   further to the freephone service provider/carrier identified by the 
   CIC.  Assume that the CIC code needs to be sent to the next SIP 
   proxy server, the INVITE message would look like 
    
        INVITE tel:+1-800-123-4567;cic=+1-6789 SIP/2.0 
 
   If the freephone number is mapped to a POTS number +1-202-256-1234 
   plus a cic of =+1-6789, the INVITE message would look like 
    
        INVITE tel:+1-202-256-1234;cic=+1-6789  SIP/2.0 
    
   Please note that the translated POTS number is placed right after 
   "tel:" after the number translation.   Although the "To" header may 
   contain the freephone number, there are cases where the freephone 
   number (translated-from-number) may need to be passed in the tel URL 
   or sip URL.  It is for further study.   
    
 
6.3  Conversion from "tel" URL to "sip" URL 
    
   The SIP INVITE message contains a "Request-URI" element that is used 
   by the SIP servers for making routing decisions.  As indicated in 
   [3], SIP servers may support Request-URIs with schemes other than 
   "SIP" URL, for example, the "tel" URL scheme.  It is also known that 
   anything that is defined for the "tel" URL can be converted to the 
   SIP URL.  Therefore, the sip URL can automatically support the 
   proposed parameters to the "tel" URL to carry the NP- and freephone-
   related information.  Some enhancements to the SIP protocol may be 
   required to fully support the NP and freephone service (e.g., to

NP and Freephone Service 
 
   carry the "cic" information when the user portion does not carry a 
   telephone number).  Those are outside the scope of this document. 
    
   Two examples are shown below to show how a "tel" URL is converted to 
   a "sip" URL. 
    
    
   Example 1: A "tel" URL such as 
    
        tel:+1-202-533-1234;rn=+1-202-544-0000;npdi 
    
   can be converted to a "sip" URL shown below. 
    
        sip:+1-202-533-1234;rn=+1-202-544-0000;      
            npdi@sip.abc.com;user=phone 
    
   Example 2: A "tel" URL such as 
    
        tel:+1-800-123-4567;cic=+1-6789 
    
   can be converted to a "sip" URL shown below. 
    
        sip:+1-800-123-4567;cic=+1-6789@sip.xyz.com;user=phone 
    
 
7. Interworking Between GSTN ISUP and SIP 
    
   It is possible that interworking between SIP and Signaling System 
   No. 7 (SS7) Integrated Services Digital Network User Part (ISUP) is 
   required at the border between the GSTN and the IP-based network.  
   For SIP to GSTN interworking and depending on the national ISUP 
   support of NP and freephone service, the information in the "tel" 
   URL is mapped/carried in the proper ISUP parameters.  Some possible 
   mappings are briefly described here; however, the exact mapping 
   between the SIP and ISUP are defined by the "SIP for Telephony" 
   (SIP-T)[9,10], a mechanism that uses SIP to facilitate the 
   interconnection of the GSTN with IP.  It is assumed that all the NP- 
   and freephone-related parameters are present to simplify the 
   discussion.  The interworking rules may be different if some 
   parameters are not present. 
    
   For the GSTN in the U.S., the routing number in the "rn" parameter 
   is carried in the ISUP Called Party Number parameter.  The phone 
   number after "tel:" is carried in the ISUP Generic Address Parameter 
   (GAP) as the "ported number."  National numbers are usually carried 
   (e.g., without the "+" and the country code) in the ISUP parameter.  
   The presence of the "npdi" parameter causes the Ported Number 
   Translation Indicator (PNTI) bit in the Forward Call Indicator (FCI) 
   parameter to be set to "1."  If the terminating GSTN supports 
   concatenated routing number and directory number (e.g., in Europe), 
   then the routing number and the POTS number may be concatenated and 
   put in the ISUP Called Party Number parameter.  The Nature of 
   Address value will be set according to the terminating GSTN's

   ISUP/NP standards (e.g., a special value is assigned to indicate 
   concatenated numbers).  If to be carried further the "cic" can be 
   mapped to the ISUP Carrier Identification Parameter (CIP). 
    
   For GSTN to IP interworking, when the ISUP signaling contains the NP 
   related information, the NP related information is mapped to the 
   "tel" URL.  This happens for domestic calls where the originating 
   GSTN has performed the NPDB query, or for international calls that 
   have arrived at the terminating country's GSTN where that GSTN has 
   performed the NPDB query.  It is assumed that the GSTN routes the 
   call via the IP-based network to the terminating switch or network 
   in the same country, and SIP and ISUP interworking is involved.  For 
   the GSTN in the U.S., the interworking is straightforward.  The PNTI 
   bit in the ISUP FCI parameter of "1" will cause "npdi" to be 
   included," the number in the Called Party Number parameter plus the 
   "+" and the country code, if a global routing number, is carried in 
   the "rn" parameter, and the called party number in the Generic 
   Address Parameter plus the "+" and the country code, if a global 
   phone number, appears after "tel:".  For GSTN that supports 
   concatenated routing number and directory number (e.g., in some 
   European countries), the IP entity that performs the interworking 
   may need to know the routing number used by the GSTN so that the 
   routing number and the directory number in the concatenated format 
   in the ISUP Called Party Number parameter can be separated and 
   transported in the "rn" parameter and after "tel:" by adding the "+" 
   and the country code to them if they are global routing number and 
   phone number.  It is also possible to simply put the ISUP Called 
   Party Number (with "+" and country code for a global phone number) 
   after "tel:" without separating out the routing number and POTS 
   number. 
    
   The possible mapping between the American National Standards 
   Institute (ANSI) ISUP and "tel" URL are summarized below.  It is 
   assumed that all the information involved in the discussion is in 
   the signaling message to simplify the discussion.  As indicated 
   earlier, SIP-T is the one that defines the exact mapping.

New Parameters for the "tel" URL to Support           November 19, 2003 
NP and Freephone Service 
 
8. Conclusion 
 
   This Internet Draft proposes three parameters to the "tel" URL 
   described in [4] to allow the SIP protocol to carry the NP- and 
   freephone service-related information in the "tel" URL.  There are 
   several places in the SIP messages where URLs can be carried.  For 
   example, each Contact header in the "302 Moved" response can carry 
   one or more than one URL.  The parameters proposed in this document 
   also apply to the "tel" or "sip" URL at those places in addition to 
   the SIP Request-URI element.  With those parameters, people surely 
   will come up innovative ways of using SIP to support many of the 
   existing and new services. 
    
 
9. Security Considerations 
 
   In addition to those security implications discussed in the revised 
   ôtelö URL [4], there are new security implications associated with 
   the proposed parameters. 
    
   If the value of the ôrnö or ôcicö is changed illegally when the SIP 
   INVITE messages are en route to the destination entity, those 
   messages may be routed to the wrong network or network element 
   causing the sessions be rejected. 
    
   If the ônpdiö is illegally inserted when the SIP INVITE messages are 
   en route to the destination entity, those messages may be routed to 
   the wrong network or network element causing the sessions be 
   rejected.  It is less a problem if the ônpdiö is illegally removed.  
   An additional NPDB query may be performed to retrieve the ôrnö 
   information and have the ônpdiö included again. 
    
    
10. IANA Considerations  
     
   The three parameters proposed in this document are to be registered 
   with IANA as the new parameters to the ôtelö URL [4]. 
    
   1. Parameter name û rn 
      Applicability û used to carry a routing number (see Section 3) 
      Mandatory or optional û optional 
      Restrictions on syntax û see Section 5 
      Reference to a specification û defined in this document 
    
   2. Parameter name û npdi 
      Applicability û its presence indicates that NPDB dip has been 
      performed (see Section 3) 
      Mandatory or optional û optional 
      Restrictions on syntax û see Section 5 
      Reference to a specification û defined in this document
