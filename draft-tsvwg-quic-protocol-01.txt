       QUIC: A UDP-Based Secure and Reliable Transport for HTTP/2
                      draft-tsvwg-quic-protocol-01

Abstract

   QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connection) is a new multiplexed and secure
   transport atop UDP, designed from the ground up and optimized for
   HTTP/2 semantics.  While built with HTTP/2 as the primary application
   protocol, QUIC builds on decades of transport and security
   experience, and implements mechanisms that make it attractive as a
   modern general-purpose transport.  QUIC provides multiplexing and
   flow control equivalent to HTTP/2, security equivalent to TLS, and
   connection semantics, reliability, and congestion control equivalent
   to TCP.

3.  Introduction

   QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connection) is a new multiplexed and secure
   transport atop UDP, designed from the ground up and optimized for
   HTTP/2 semantics.  While built with HTTP/2 as the primary application
   protocol, QUIC builds on decades of transport and security
   experience, and implements mechanisms that make it attractive as a
   modern general-purpose transport.  QUIC provides multiplexing and
   flow control equivalent to HTTP/2, security equivalent to TLS, and
   connection semantics, reliability, and congestion control equivalent
   to TCP.

   QUIC operates entirely in userspace, and is currently shipped to
   users as a part of the Chromium browser, enabling rapid deployment
   and experimentation.  As a userspace transport atop UDP, QUIC allows
   innovations which have proven difficult to deploy with existing
   protocols as they are hampered by legacy clients and middleboxes, or
   by prolonged Operating System development and deployment cycles.

   An important goal for QUIC is to inform better transport design
   through rapid experimentation.  As a result, we hope to inform and

   where possible migrate distilled changes into TCP and TLS, which tend
   to have much longer iteration cycles.

   This document describes the conceptual design and the wire
   specification of the QUIC protocol.  Accompanying documents describe
   the combined crypto and transport handshake [QUIC-CRYPTO], and loss
   recovery and congestion control [draft-quic-loss-recovery].
   Additional resources, including a more detailed rationale document,
   are available on the Chromium QUIC webpage [1].

4.  Conventions and Definitions

   All integer values used in QUIC, including length, version, and type,
   are in little-endian byte order, and not in network byte order.  QUIC
   does not enforce alignment of types in dynamically sized frames.

   A few terms that are used throughout this document are defined below.

   o  "Client": The endpoint initiating a QUIC connection.

   o  "Server": The endpoint accepting incoming QUIC connections.

   o  "Endpoint": The client or server end of a connection.

   o  "Stream": A bi-directional flow of bytes across a logical channel
      within a QUIC connection.

   o  "Connection": A conversation between two QUIC endpoints with a
      single encryption context that multiplexes streams within it.

   o  "Connection ID": The identifier for a QUIC connection.

   o  "QUIC Packet": A well-formed UDP payload that can be parsed by a
      QUIC receiver.  QUIC packet size in this document refers to the
      UDP payload size.

5.  A QUIC Overview

   We now briefly describe QUIC's key mechanisms and benefits.  QUIC is
   functionally equivalent to TCP+TLS+HTTP/2, but implemented on top of
   UDP.  Key advantages of QUIC over TCP+TLS+HTTP/2 include:

   o  Connection establishment latency

   o  Flexible congestion control

   o  Multiplexing without head-of-line blocking




Hamilton, et al.         Expires January 9, 2016                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                    QUIC                         July 2015


   o  Authenticated and encrypted header and payload

   o  Stream and connection flow control

   o  Forward error correction

   o  Connection migration

5.1.  Connection Establishment Latency

   For a complete description of connection establishment, please see
   the QUIC Crypto design [2] document.  Briefly, QUIC handshakes
   frequently require zero roundtrips before sending payload, as
   compared to 1-3 roundtrips for TCP+TLS.

   The first time a QUIC client connects to a server, the client must
   perform a 1-roundtrip handshake in order to acquire the necessary
   information to complete the handshake.  The client sends an inchoate
   (empty) client hello (CHLO), the server sends a rejection (REJ) with
   the information the client needs to make forward progress.  This
   information includes a source address token, which is used to verify
   the client's IP on a subsequent CHLO, and the server's certificates.
   The next time the client sends a CHLO, it can use the cached
   credentials from the previous connection to immediately send
   encrypted requests to the server.

5.2.  Flexible Congestion Control

   QUIC has pluggable congestion control and richer signaling than TCP,
   which enables QUIC to provide richer information to congestion
   control algorithms than TCP.  Currently, the default congestion
   control is a reimplementation of TCP Cubic; we are currently
   experimenting with alternative approaches.

   One example of richer information is that each packet, both original
   and retransmitted, carries a new sequence number.  This allows a QUIC
   sender to distinguish ACKs for retransmissions from ACKs for original
   transmissions, thus avoiding TCP's retransmission ambiguity problem.
   QUIC ACKs also explicitly carry the delay between the receipt of a
   packet and its acknowledgment being sent, and together with the
   monotonically-increasing sequence numbers, this allows for precise
   roundtrip-time (RTT) calculation.

   Finally, QUIC's ACK frames support up to 256 NACK ranges, so QUIC is
   more resilient to reordering than TCP (with SACK), as well as able to
   keep more bytes on the wire when there is reordering or loss.  Both
   client and server have a more accurate picture of which packets the
   peer has received.

5.3.  Stream and Connection Flow Control

   QUIC implements stream- and connection-level flow control, closely
   following HTTP/2's flow control.  QUIC's stream-level flow control
   works as follows.  A QUIC receiver advertises the absolute byte
   offset within each stream upto which the receiver is willing to
   receive data.  As data is sent, received, and delivered on a
   particular stream, the receiver sends WINDOW_UPDATE frames that
   increase the advertised offset limit for that stream, allowing the
   peer to send more data on that stream.

   In addition to per-stream flow control, QUIC implements connection-
   level flow control to limit the aggregate buffer that a QUIC receiver
   is willing to allocate to a connection.  Connection flow control
   works in the same way as stream flow control, but the bytes delivered
   and highest received offset are all aggregates across all streams.

   Similar to TCP's receive-window autotuning, QUIC implements
   autotuning of flow control credits for both stream and connection
   flow controllers.  QUIC's autotuning increases the size of the
   credits sent per WINDOW_UPDATE frame if it appears to be limiting the
   sender's rate, and throttles the sender when the receiving
   application is slow.

5.4.  Multiplexing

   HTTP/2 on TCP suffers from head-of-line blocking in TCP.  Since
   HTTP/2 multiplexes many streams atop TCP's single-bytestream
   abstraction, a loss of a TCP segment results in blocking of all
   subsequent segments until a retransmission arrives, irrespective of
   the HTTP/2 stream that is encapsulated in subsequent segments.

   Because QUIC is designed from the ground up for multiplexed
   operation, lost packets carrying data for an individual stream
   generally only impact that specific stream.  Each stream frame can be
   immediately dispatched to that stream on arrival, so streams without
   loss can continue to be reassembled and make forward progress in the
   application.

   Caveat: QUIC currently compresses HTTP headers via HTTP/2 HPACK
   header compression, which imposes head-of-line blocking for header
   frames only.

5.5.  Authenticated and Encrypted Header and Payload

   TCP headers appear in plaintext on the wire and not authenticated,
   causing a plethora of injection and header manipulation issues for
   TCP, such as receive-window manipulation and sequence-number



Hamilton, et al.         Expires January 9, 2016                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                    QUIC                         July 2015


   overwriting.  While some of these are active attacks, others are
   mechanisms used by middleboxes in the network sometimes in an attempt
   to transparently improve TCP performance.  However, even
   "performance-enhancing" middleboxes still effectively limit the
   evolvability of the transport protocol, as has been observed in the
   design of MPTCP and in its subsequent deployability issues.

   QUIC packets are always authenticated and typically the payload is
   fully encrypted.  The parts of the packet header which are not
   encrypted are still authenticated by the receiver, so as to thwart
   any packet injection or manipulation by third parties.  QUIC protects
   connections from witting or unwitting middlebox manipulation of end-
   to-end communication.

   Caveat: PUBLIC_RESET packets that reset a connection are currently
   not authenticated.

5.6.  Forward Error Correction

   In order to recover lost packets without waiting for a
   retransmission, QUIC currently employs a simple XOR-based FEC scheme.
   An FEC packet contains parity of the packets in the FEC group.  If
   one of the packets in the group is lost, the contents of that packet
   can be recovered from the FEC packet and the remaining packets in the
   group.  The sender may decide whether to send FEC packets to optimize
   specific scenarios (e.g., beginning and end of a request).

5.7.  Connection Migration

   TCP connections are identified by a 4-tuple of source address, source
   port, destination address and destination port.  A well-known problem
   with TCP is that connections do not survive IP address changes (for
   example, by switching from WiFi to cellular) or port number changes
   (when a client's NAT binding expires causing a change in the port
   number seen at the server).  While MPTCP addresses the connection
   migration problem for TCP, it is still plagued by lack of middlebox
   support and lack of OS deployment.

   QUIC connections are identified by a 64-bit Connection ID, randomly
   generated by the client.  QUIC can survive IP address changes and NAT
   re-bindings since the Connection ID remains the same across these
   migrations.  QUIC also provides automatic cryptographic verification
   of a migrating client, since a migrating client continues to use the
   same session key for encrypting and decrypting packets.

6.  Packet Types and Formats

   QUIC has four packet types: Version Negotiation Packets, Frame
   Packets, FEC Packets, and Public Reset Packets.  All QUIC packets
   should be sized to fit within the path's MTU to avoid IP
   fragmentation.  Path MTU discovery is a work in progress, and the
   current QUIC implementation uses a 1350-byte maximum QUIC packet size
   for IPv6, 1370 for IPv4.

6.1.  QUIC Common Packet Header

   All QUIC packets on the wire begin with a common header sized between
   2 and 21 bytes.  The wire format for the common header is as follows:

     0        1        2        3        4            8
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+---    ---+
| Public |    Connection ID (0, 8, 32, or 64)    ...    | ->
|Flags(8)|      (variable length)                       |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+---    ---+

     9       10       11        12
+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|      QUIC Version (32)            | ->
|         (optional)                |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+

    13      14       15        16        17       18       19       20
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|         Sequence Number (8, 16, 32, or 48)          |Private | FEC (8)|
|                         (variable length)           |Flags(8)|  (opt) |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+


   QUIC packets are authenticated and encrypted.  The first part of the
   common header upto and including the Sequence Number field is
   authenticated but not encrypted, and the rest of the packet starting
   with the Private Flags field is encrypted.

   The unencrypted payload may include various type-dependent header
   bytes as described below.

   The fields in the common header are the following:

   o  Public Flags:

      *  Bit at 0x01 is set to indicate that the packet contains a QUIC
         Version.  This bit must be set by a client in all packets until
         confirmation from the server arrives agreeing to the proposed

Internet-Draft                    QUIC                         July 2015


         version is received by the client.  A server indicates
         agreement on a version by sending packets without setting this
         bit.  Version Negotiation is described in more detail later.

      *  Bit at 0x02 is set to indicate that the packet is a Public
         Reset packet.

      *  Two bits at 0x0C indicate the size of the Connection ID that is
         present in the packet.  These bits must be set to 0x0C in all
         packets until negotiated to a different value for a given
         direction (e.g., client may request fewer bytes of the
         Connection ID be presented).

         +  0x0C indicates an 8-byte Connection ID is present

         +  0x08 indicates that a 4-byte Connection ID is present

         +  0x04 indicates that a 1-byte Connection ID is used

         +  0x00 indicates that the Connection ID is omitted

      *  Two bits at 0x30 indicate the number of low-order-bytes of the
         packet sequence number that are present in each packet.  The
         bits are only used for Frame Packets.  For Public Reset and
         Version Negotiation Packets (sent by the server) which don't
         have a sequence number, these bits are not used and must be set
         to 0.  Within this 2 bit mask:

         +  0x30 indicates that 6 bytes of the sequence number is
            present

         +  0x20 indicates that 4 bytes of the sequence number is
            present

         +  0x10 indicates that 2 bytes of the sequence number is
            present

         +  0x00 indicates that 1 byte of the sequence number is present

      *  Two bits at 0xC0 are currently unused, and must be set to 0.

   o  Connection ID: This is an unsigned 64 bit statistically random
      number selected by the client that is the identifier of the
      connection.  Because QUIC connections are designed to remain
      established even if the client roams, the IP 4-tuple (source IP,
      source port, destination IP, destination port) may be insufficient
      to identify the connection.  For each transmission direction, when




Hamilton, et al.         Expires January 9, 2016                [Page 8]

      less uniqueness is sufficient to identify the connection, a
      truncated transmitted Connection ID length is negotiable.

   o  QUIC Version: A 32 bit opaque tag that represents the version of
      the QUIC protocol.  Only present if the public flags contain
      FLAG_VERSION (i.e public_flags & FLAG_VERSION !=0).  A client may
      set this flag, and include EXACTLY one proposed version, as well
      as including arbitrary data (conforming to that version).  A
      server may set this flag when the client-proposed version was
      unsupported, and may then provide a list (0 or more) of acceptable
      versions, but MUST not include any data after the version(s).
      Examples of version values in recent experimental versions include
      "Q025" which corresponds to byte 9 containing 'Q", byte 10
      containing '0", etc.  [See list of changes in various versions
      listed at the end of this document.]

   o  Sequence Number: The lower 8, 16, 32, or 48 bits of the sequence
      number, based on which FLAG_?BYTE_SEQUENCE_NUMBER flag is set in
      the public flags.  See "Sequence numbers" below.

   o  Private Flags:

      *  0x01 = FLAG_ENTROPY - for data packets, signifies that this
         packet contains the 1 bit of entropy, for fec packets, contains
         the xor of the entropy of protected packets.

      *  0x02 = FLAG_FEC_GROUP - indicates whether the fec byte is
         present.

      *  0x04 = FLAG_FEC - signifies that this packet represents an FEC
         packet.

   o  FEC (FEC Group Number Offset): An FEC Group Number is the Packet
      Sequence Number of the first packet in the FEC group.  The FEC
      Group Number Offset is an 8 bit unsigned value which should be
      subtracted from the current packet's Packet Sequence Number to
      yield the FEC Group Number for this packet.  This is only present
      if the private flags contain FLAG_FEC_GROUP.  All packets within a
      single FEC group must have Sequence Numbers encoded into an
      identical number of bytes (i.e., the Sequence Number coding must
      not change during a group)

   o  Sequence Number: Each QUIC Frame Packet (as opposed to public
      reset and version negotiation packets) is assigned a sequence
      number by the sender.  The first packet sent by an endpoint shall
      have a sequence number of 1, and each subsequent packet shall have
      a sequence number one larger than that of the previous packet.
      The lower 64 bits of the sequence number may be used as part of a

      cryptographic nonce; therefore, a QUIC endpoint must not send a
      packet with a sequence number that cannot be represented in 64
      bits.  If a QUIC endpoint transmits a packet with a sequence
      number of (2^64-1), that packet must include a CONNECTION_CLOSE
      frame with an error code of QUIC_SEQUENCE_NUMBER_LIMIT_REACHED,
      and the endpoint must not transmit any additional packets.  At
      most the lower 48 bits of a sequence number are transmitted.  To
      enable unambiguous reconstruction of the sequence number by the
      receiver, a QUIC endpoint must not transmit a packet whose
      sequence number is larger by (2^(bitlength-2)) than the largest
      sequence number for which an acknowledgement is known to have been
      transmitted by the receiver.  Therefore, there must never be more
      than (2^46) packets in flight.  Any truncated sequence number
      shall be inferred to have the value closest to the one more than
      the largest known sequence number of the endpoint which
      transmitted the packet that originally contained the truncated
      sequence number.  The transmitted portion of the sequence number
      matches the lowest bits of the inferred value.

6.2.  Version Negotiation Packet

   (Describe version negotiation packet.)

6.3.  Frame Packet

   Beyond the Common Header, Frame Packets have a payload that is a
   series of type-prefixed frames.  The format of frame types is defined
   later in this document, but the general format of a Frame Packet is
   as follows:

   +--------+---...---+--------+---...---+
   | Type   | Payload | Type   | Payload |
   +--------+---...---+--------+---...---+

6.4.  FEC Packet

   FEC packets (those packets with FLAG_FEC set) have a payload that
   simply contains an XOR of the null-padded payload of each Data Packet
   in the FEC group.

   +-----...----+
   | Redundancy |
   +-----...----+

6.5.  Public Reset Packet

   Public reset packets begin with an 8-bit public flags and 64-bit
   Connection ID.  The rest of the public reset packets is encoded as if
   it were a crypto handshake message of the tag PRST (see accompanying
   crypto document for more about QUIC Tags):

7.  Life of a QUIC Connection

7.1.  Connection Establishment

   A QUIC client is the endpoint that initiates a connection.  QUIC's
   connection establishment intertwines version negotiation with the
   crypto and transport handshakes to reduce connection establishment
   latency.  We first describe version negotiation below.

   (Describe Version Negotiation.)

   The rest of the connection establishment is described in the crypto
   handshake document [QUIC-CRYPTO].  The crypto handshake is
   encapsulated within Frame Packets, as stream data on the crypto
   stream (described later in this section).

Internet-Draft                    QUIC                         July 2015


   During connection establishment, QUIC sends various "Tags" inside the
   handshake packets for negotiating transport parameters.  The
   currently used Tags are described later in the document.

7.2.  Data Transfer

   QUIC implements connection reliability, congestion control, and flow
   control.  QUIC flow control closely follows HTTP/2's flow control.
   QUIC reliability and congestion control are described in an
   accompanying document.  A QUIC connection uses a single packet
   sequence number space for shared congestion control and loss recovery
   across the connection.

   All data transferred in a QUIC connection, including the crypto
   handshake, is sent as data inside streams, but the ACKs acknowledge
   QUIC Packets.

   This section conceptually describes the use of streams for data
   transfer within a QUIC connection.  The various frames that are
   mentioned in this section are described in the section on Frame Types
   and Formats.

7.2.1.  Life of a QUIC Stream

   Streams are independent sequences of bi-directional data cut into
   stream frames.  Streams can be created either by the client or the
   server, can concurrently send data interleaved with other streams,
   and can be cancelled.  QUIC's stream lifetime is modeled closely
   after HTTP/2's [RFC7540].  (HTTP/2's usage of QUIC streams is
   described in more detail later in the document.)

   Stream creation is done implicitly, by sending a STREAM frame for a
   given stream.  To avoid stream ID collision, the Stream-ID must be
   even if the server initiates the stream, and odd if the client
   initiates the stream. 0 is not a valid Stream-ID.  Stream 1 is
   reserved for the crypto handshake, which should be the first client-
   initiated stream.  When using HTTP/2 over QUIC, Stream 3 is reserved
   for transmitting compressed headers for all other streams, ensuring
   reliable in-order delivery and processing of headers.

   Stream-IDs from each side of the connection must increase
   monotonically as new streams are created.  E.g.  Stream 2 may be
   created after stream 3, but stream 7 must not be created after stream
   9.  The peer may receive streams out of order.  For example, if a
   server receives packet 10 including frames for stream 9 before it
   receives packet 9 including frames for stream 7, it should handle
   this gracefully.




Hamilton, et al.         Expires January 9, 2016               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                    QUIC                         July 2015


   If the endpoint receiving a STREAM frame does not want to accept the
   stream, it can immediately respond with a RST_STREAM frame (described
   below).  Note, however, that the initiating endpoint may have already
   sent data on the stream as well; this data must be ignored.

   Once a stream is created, it can be used to send and receive data.
   This means that a series of stream frames can be sent by a QUIC
   endpoint on a stream until the stream is terminated in that
   direction.

   Either QUIC endpoint can terminate a stream normally.  There are
   three ways that streams can be terminated:

   1.  Normal termination: Since streams are bidirectional, streams can
       be "half-closed" or "closed".  When one side of the stream sends
       a frame with the FIN bit set to true, the stream is considered to
       be "half-closed" in that direction.  A FIN indicates that no
       further data will be sent from the sender of the FIN on this
       stream.  When a QUIC endpoint has both sent and received a FIN,
       the endpoint considers the stream to be "closed".  While the FIN
       should be sent with the last user data for a stream, the FIN bit
       can be sent on an empty stream frame following the last data on
       the stream.

   2.  Abrupt termination: Either the client or server can send a
       RST_STREAM frame for a stream at any time.  A RST_STREAM frame
       contains an error code to indicate the reason for failure (error
       codes are listed later in the document.)  When a RST_STREAM frame
       is sent from the stream originator, it indicates a failure to
       complete the stream and that no further data will be sent on the
       stream.  When a RST_STREAM frame is sent from the stream
       receiver, the sender, upon receipt, should stop sending any data
       on the stream.  The stream receiver should be aware that there is
       a race between data already in transit from the sender and the
       time the RST_STREAM frame is received.  In order to ensure that
       the connection-level flow control is correctly accounted, even if
       a RST_STREAM frame is received, a sender needs to ensure that
       either: the FIN and all bytes in the stream are received by the
       peer or a RST_STREAM frame is received by the peer.  This also
       means that the sender of a RST_STREAM frame needs to continue
       responding to incoming STREAM_FRAMEs on this stream with the
       appropriate WINDOW_UPDATEs to ensure that the sender does not get
       flow control blocked attempting to delivery the FIN.

   3.  Streams are also terminated when the connection is terminated, as
       described in the next section.

7.3.  Connection Termination

   Connections should remain open until they become idle for a pre-
   negotiated period of time.  When a server decides to terminate an
   idle connection, it should not notify the client to avoid waking up
   the radio on mobile devices.  A QUIC connection, once established,
   can be terminated in one of two ways:

   1.  Explicit Shutdown: An endpoint sends a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame to
       the peer initiating a connection termination.  An endpoint may
       send a GOAWAY frame to the peer prior to a CONNECTION_CLOSE to
       indicate that the connection will soon be terminated.  A GOAWAY
       frame when sent signals to the peer that any active streams will
       continue to be processed, but the sender of the GOAWAY will not
       initiate any additional streams and will not accept any new
       incoming streams.  On termination of the active streams, a
       CONNECTION_CLOSE may be sent.  If an endpoint sends a
       CONNECTION_CLOSE frame while unterminated streams are active (no
       FIN bit or RST_STREAM frames have been sent or received for one
       or more streams), then the peer must assume that the streams were
       incomplete and were abnormally terminated.

   2.  Implicit Shutdown: The default idle timeout for a QUIC connection
       is 30 seconds, and is a required parameter("ICSL") in connection
       negotiation.  The maximum is 10 minutes.  If there is no network
       activity for the duration of the idle timeout, the connection is
       closed.  By default a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame will be sent.  A
       silent close option can be enabled when it is expensive to send
       an explicit close, such as mobile networks that must wake up the
       radio.

   An endpoint may also send a PUBLIC_RESET packet at any time during
   the connection to abruptly terminate an active connection.  A
   PUBLIC_RESET is the QUIC equivalent of a TCP RST.

8.  Frame Types and Formats

   QUIC Frame Packets are populated by frames. which have a Frame Type
   byte, which itself has a type-dependent interpretation, followed by
   type-dependent frame header fields.  All frames are contained within
   single QUIC Packets and no frame can span across a QUIC Packet
   boundary.

8.1.  Frame Types

   There are two interpretations for the Frame Type byte, resulting in
   two frame types: Special Frame Types, and Regular Frame Types.
   Special Frame Types encode both a Frame Type and corresponding flags



Hamilton, et al.         Expires January 9, 2016               [Page 14]

   all in the Frame Type byte, while Regular Frame Types use the Frame
   Type byte simply.

   Currently defined Special Frame Types are:

      +------------------+-----------------------------+

8.2.  STREAM Frame

   The STREAM frame is used to both implicitly create a stream and to
   send data on it, and is as follows:

   The fields in the STREAM frame header are as follows:

   o  Frame Type: The Frame Type byte is an 8-bit value containing
      various flags (1fdooossB):

      *  The leftmost bit must be set to 1 indicating that this is a
         STREAM frame.

      *  The 'f' bit is the FIN bit.  When set to 1, this bit indicates
         the sender is done sending on this stream and wishes to "half-
         close" (described in more detail later.)

      *  which is described in more detail later in this document.

      *  The 'd' bit indicates whether a Data Length is present in the
         STREAM header.  When set to 0, this field indicates that the
         STREAM frame extends to the end of the Packet.

      *  The next three 'ooo' bits encode the length of the Offset
         header field as 0, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, or 64 bits long.

      *  The next two 'ss' bits encode the length of the Stream ID
         header field as 8, 16, 24, or 32 bits long.

   o  Stream ID: A variable-sized unsigned ID unique to this stream.

   o  Offset: A variable-sized unsigned number specifying the byte
      offset in the stream for this block of data.





Hamilton, et al.         Expires January 9, 2016               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft                    QUIC                         July 2015


   o  Data length: An optional 16-bit unsigned number specifying the
      length of the data in this stream frame.  The option to omit the
      length should only be used when the packet is a "full-sized"
      Packet, to avoid the risk of corruption via padding.

   A stream frame must always have either non-zero data length or the
   FIN bit set.

8.3.  ACK Frame

   The ACK frame is sent to inform the peer which packets have been
   received, as well as which packets are still considered missing by
   the receiver (the contents of missing packets may need to be resent).
   The design of QUIC's ACK frame is different from TCP's and SCTP's
   SACK representations in that QUIC ACKs indicate the largest sequence
   number observed thus far followed by a list of missing packet, or
   NACK, ranges indicating gaps in packets received below this sequence
   number.  To limit the NACK ranges to the ones that haven't yet been
   communicated to the peer, the peer periodically sends STOP_WAITING
   frames that signal the receiver to stop waiting for packets below a
   specified squence number, raising the "least unacked" sequence number
   at the receiver.  A sender of an ACK frame thus reports only those
   NACK ranges between the received least unacked and the reported
   largest observed sequence numbers.  The frame is as follows:

 +--------+-----------------------------------------------------+

   The fields in the ACK frame are as follows:

   o  Frame Type: The Frame Type byte is an 8-bit value containing
      various flags (01ntllmmB).

      *  The first two bits must be set to 01 indicating that this is an
         ACK frame.

      *  The 'n' bit indicates whether the frame has any NACK ranges.

      *  The 't' bit indicates whether the ACK frame has been truncated.
         Truncation can happen when the complete ACK frame does not fit
         within a single QUIC Packet, or when the number of NACK ranges
         exceeds the maximum number of reportable NACK ranges (255).

Internet-Draft                    QUIC                         July 2015


         When truncated, the ACK frame limits the largest observed
         sequence number to the largest that can be reported, even
         though the receiver may have received packets with sequence
         numbers larger than the largest observed.

      *  The two 'll' bits encode the length of the Largest Observed
         field as 1, 2, 4, or 6 bytes long.

      *  The two 'mm' bits encode the length of the Missing Packet
         Sequence Number Delta field as 1, 2, 4, or 6 bytes long.

   o  Received Entropy: An 8 bit unsigned value specifying the
      cumulative hash of entropy in all received packets up to the
      largest observed packet.  Entropy accumulation is described later
      in this section.

   o  Largest Observed: A variable-sized unsigned value representing the
      largest sequence number the peer has observed.  When an ACK frame
      is truncated, it indicates a sequence number greater than the
      specified largest observed has been received, but information
      about those additional receptions can't fit into this frame
      (typically due to packet size restrictions).

   o  Largest Observed Delta Time: A 16 bit unsigned float with 11
      explicit bits of mantissa and 5 bits of explicit exponent,
      specifying the time elapsed in microseconds from when largest
      observed was received until this Ack frame was sent.  The bit
      format is loosely modeled after IEEE 754.  For example, 1
      microsecond is represented as 0x1, which has an exponent of zero,
      presented in the 5 high order bits, and mantissa of 1, presented
      in the 11 low order bits.  When the explicit exponent is greater
      than zero, an implicit high-order 12th bit of 1 is assumed in the
      mantissa.  For example, a floatingvalue of 0x800 has an explicit
      exponent of 1, as well as an explicit mantissa of 0, but then has
      an effective mantissa of 4096 (12th bit is assumed to be 1).
      Additionally, the actual exponent is one-less than the explicit
      exponent, and the value represents 4096 microseconds.  Any values
      larger than the representable range are clamped to 0xFFFF.

   o  Num Timestamp: An 8-bit unsigned value specifying the number of
      TCP timestamps that are included in this frame.  There will be
      this many pairs of <sequence number, timestamp> following in the
      timestamps.

   o  Delta Largest Observed: An 8-bit unsigned value specifying the
      sequence number delta from the first timestamp to the largest
      observed.

Internet-Draft                    QUIC                         July 2015


   o  Time Since Largest Observed: A 32-bit unsigned value specifying
      the first timestamp.  This is the time delta in microseconds from
      the time the receiver's packet framer was created.

   o  Time Since Previous Timestamp: A 16-bit unsigned value specifying
      the first timestamp.  This is the time delta from the previous
      timestamp.

   o  Num Ranges: An optional 8-bit unsigned value specifying the number
      of missing packet ranges between largest observed and least
      unacked.  Only present if the 'n' flag bit is 1.

   o  Missing Packet Sequence Number Delta: A variable-sized sequence
      number delta.  For the first missing packet range, it is a delta
      from the largest observed.  For subsequent nack ranges, it is the
      number of packets received between ranges.  In the case of the
      first nack range, a value of 0 specifies that the packet reported
      as the largest observed is missing.  In the case of the later nack
      ranges, a value of 0 indicates the missing packet ranges are
      contiguous (used only when more than 256 packets in a row were
      lost).

   o  Range Length: An 8-bit unsigned value specifying one less than the
      number of sequential nacks in the range.

   o  Num Revived: An 8-bit unsigned value specifying the number of
      revived packets, recovered via FEC.  Just like the Num Ranges
      field, this field is only present if the 'n' flag bit is 1.

   o  Revived Packet Sequence Number: A variable-sized unsigned value
      representing a packet the peer has revived via FEC.  Its length is
      the same as the length of the Largest Observed field.  All
      sequence numbers in this list are sorted in ascending order
      (smallest first) and must also be present in the list of NACK
      ranges.

8.3.1.  Entropy Accumulation

   The entropy bits for a subset of packets (known to a receiver or
   sender) are accumulated into an 8 bit unsigned value, and similarly
   presented in both a STOP_WAITING frame and an ACK frame.  If we
   defined E(k) to be the FLAG_ENTROPY bit present in packet sequence
   number k, then the k'th packet's contribution C(k) is defined to be
   E(k) left shifted by k mod 8 bits.  The accumulated entropy is then
   the bitwise-XOR sum of the contributions C(k), for all packets in the
   desired subset.

8.4.  STOP_WAITING Frame

   The STOP_WAITING frame is sent to inform the peer that it should not
   continue to wait for packets with sequence numbers lower than a
   specified value.  The sequence number is encoded in 1, 2, 4 or 6
   bytes, using the same coding length as is specified for the sequence
   number for the enclosing packet's header (specified in the QUIC Frame
   Packet's Public Flags field.)  The frame is as follows:

      0        1        2        3         4        5        6      7
 +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+-------+-------+
 |Type (8)|Sent    |   Least unacked delta (8, 16, 32, or 48 bits)     |
 |        |Entropy |                       (variable length)           |
 +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+-------+-------+

   The fields in the STOP_WAITING frame are as follows:

   o  Frame Type: The Frame Type byte is an 8-bit value that must be set
      to 0x06 indicating that this is a STOP_WAITING frame.

   o  Sent Entropy: An 8-bit unsigned value specifying the cumulative
      hash of entropy in all sent packets up to the packet with sequence
      number one less than the least unacked packet.  [See "Entropy
      Accumulation" section in the ACK frame section for details of this
      calculation.]

   o  Least Unacked Delta: A variable length sequence number delta with
      the same length as the packet header's sequence number.  In the
      case of an FEC revived packet, the same length as the other
      packets in the FEC group.  Subtract it from the header's packet
      sequence number to determine the least unacked.  The resulting
      least unacked is the smallest sequence number of any packet for
      which the sender is still awaiting an ack.  If the receiver is
      missing any packets smaller than this value, the receiver should
      consider those packets to be irrecoverably lost.

8.5.  WINDOW_UPDATE Frame

   The WINDOW_UPDATE frame is used to inform the peer of an increase in
   an endpoint's flow control receive window.  The stream ID can be 0,
   indicating this WINDOW_UPDATE applies to the connection level flow
   control window, or > 0 indicating that the specified stream should
   increase its flow control window.  The frame is as follows:

   An absolute byte offset is specified, and the receiver of a
   WINDOW_UPDATE frame may only send up to that number of bytes on the
   specified stream.  Violating flow control by sending further bytes
   will result in the receiving endpoint closing the connection.



Hamilton, et al.         Expires January 9, 2016               [Page 21]

Internet-Draft                    QUIC                         July 2015


   On receipt of multiple WINDOW_UPDATE frames for a specific stream ID,
   it is only necessary to keep track of the maximum byte offset.

   Both stream and session windows start with a default value of 16 KB,
   but this is typically increased during the handshake.  To do this, an
   endpoint should include SFCW (Stream Flow Control Window) and CFCW
   (Connection/Session Flow Control Window) tags in the CHLO/SHLO (tags
   are described in the QUIC Crypto document).  The value associated
   with each tag should be the number of bytes for initial stream window
   and initial connection window respectively.

   The frame is as follows:

       0         1                 4        5                 12
   +--------+--------+-- ... --+-------+--------+-- ... --+-------+
   |Type(8) |    Stream ID (32 bits)   |  Byte offset (64 bits)   |
   +--------+--------+-- ... --+-------+--------+-- ... --+-------+

   The fields in the WINDOW_UPDATE frame are as follows:

   o  Frame Type: The Frame Type byte is an 8-bit value that must be set
      to 0x04 indicating that this is a WINDOW_UPDATE frame.

   o  Stream ID: ID of the stream whose flow control windows is begin
      updated, or 0 to specify the connection-level flow control window.

   o  Byte offset: A 64-bit unsigned integer indicating the absolute
      byte offset of data which can be sent on the given stream.  In the
      case of connection level flow control, the cumulative number of
      bytes which can be sent on all currently open streams.

8.6.  BLOCKED Frame

   The BLOCKED frame is used to indicate to the remote endpoint that
   this endpoint is ready to send data (and has data to send), but is
   currently flow control blocked.  This is a purely informational
   frame, which is extremely useful for debugging purposes.  A receiver
   of a BLOCKED frame should simply discard it (after possibly printing
   a helpful log message).  The frame is as follows:

        0        1        2        3         4
   +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
   |Type(8) |          Stream ID (32 bits)      |
   +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

   The fields in the BLOCKED frame are as follows:

Internet-Draft                    QUIC                         July 2015


   o  Frame Type: The Frame Type byte is an 8-bit value that must be set
      to 0x05 indicating that this is a BLOCKED frame.

   o  Stream ID: A 32-bit unsigned number indicating the stream which is
      flow control blocked.  A non-zero Stream ID field specifies the
      stream that is flow control blocked.  When zero, the Stream ID
      field indicates that the connection is flow control blocked at the
      connection level.

8.7.  CONGESTION_FEEDBACK Frame

   The CONGESTION_FEEDBACK frame is an experimental frame currently not
   used.  It is intended to provide extra congestion feedback
   information outside the scope of the standard ack frame.  A
   CONGESTION_FEEDBACK frame must have the first three bits of the Frame
   Type set to 001.  The last 5 bits of the Frame Type field are
   reserved for future use.

8.8.  PADDING Frame

   The PADDING frame pads a packet with 0x00 bytes.  When this frame is
   encountered, the rest of the packet is expected to be padding bytes.
   The frame contains 0x00 bytes and extends to the end of the QUIC
   packet.  A PADDING frame only has a Frame Type field, and must have
   the 8-bit Frame Type field set to 0x00.

8.9.  RST_STREAM Frame

   The RST_STREAM frame allows for abnormal termination of a stream.
   When sent by the creator of a stream, it indicates the creator wishes
   to cancel the stream.  When sent by the receiver of a stream, it
   indicates an error or that the receiver did not want to accept the
   stream, so the stream should be closed.  The frame is as follows:

     0        1            4      5              12     8             16
+-------+--------+-- ... ----+--------+-- ... ------+-------+-- ... ------+
|Type(8)| StreamID (32 bits) | Byte offset (64 bits)| Error code (32 bits)|
+-------+--------+-- ... ----+--------+-- ... ------+-------+-- ... ------+

   The fields in a RST_STREAM frame are as follows:

   o  Frame type: The Frame Type is an 8-bit value that must be set to
      0x04 specifying that this is a RST_STREAM frame.

   o  Stream ID: The 32-bit Stream ID of the stream being terminated.

   o  Byte offset: A 64-bit unsigned integer indicating the absolute
      byte offset of the end of data for this stream.

Internet-Draft                    QUIC                         July 2015


   o  Error code: A 32-bit QuicErrorCode which indicates why the stream
      is being closed.  QuicErrorCodes are listed later in this
      document.

8.10.  PING frame

   The PING frame can be used by an endpoint to verify that a peer is
   still alive.  The PING frame contains no payload.  The receiver of a
   PING frame simply needs to ACK the packet containing this frame.  The
   PING frame should be used to keep a connection alive when a stream is
   open.  The default is to do this after 15 seconds of quiescence,
   which is much shorter than most NATs time out.  A PING frame only has
   a Frame Type field, and must have the 8-bit Frame Type field set to
   0x07.

8.11.  CONNECTION_CLOSE frame

   The CONNECTION_CLOSE frame allows for notification that the
   connection is being closed.  If there are streams in flight, those
   streams are all implicitly closed when the connection is closed.
   (Ideally, a GOAWAY frame would be sent with enough time that all
   streams are torn down.)  The frame is as follows:

        0        1             4        5        6       7
   +--------+--------+-- ... -----+--------+--------+--------+----- ...
   |Type(8) | Error code (32 bits)| Reason phrase   |  Reason phrase
   |        |                     | length (16 bits)|(variable length)
   +--------+--------+-- ... -----+--------+--------+--------+----- ...

   The fields of a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame are as follows:

   o  Frame Type: An 8-bit value that must be set to 0x02 specifying
      that this is a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame.

   o  Error Code: A 32-bit field containing the QuicErrorCode which
      indicates the reason for closing this connection.

   o  Reason Phrase Length: A 16-bit unsigned number specifying the
      length of the reason phrase.  This may be zero if the sender
      chooses to not give details beyond the QuicErrorCode.

   o  Reason Phrase: An optional human-readable explanation for why the
      connection was closed.

8.12.  GOAWAY Frame

   The GOAWAY frame allows for notification that the connection should
   stop being used, and will likely be aborted in the future.  Any
   active streams will continue to be processed, but the sender of the
   GOAWAY will not initiate any additional streams, and will not accept
   any new streams.  The frame is as follows:

        0        1             4      5       6       7      8
   +--------+--------+-- ... -----+-------+-------+-------+------+
   |Type(8) | Error code (32 bits)| Last Good Stream ID (32 bits)| ->
   +--------+--------+-- ... -----+-------+-------+-------+------+

         9        10       11
   +--------+--------+--------+----- ...
   | Reason phrase   |  Reason phrase
   | length (16 bits)|(variable length)
   +--------+--------+--------+----- ...

   The fields of a GOAWAY frame are as follows:

   o  Frame type: An 8-bit value that must be set to 0x06 specifying
      that this is a GOAWAY frame.

   o  Error Code: A 32-bit field containing the QuicErrorCode which
      indicates the reason for closing this connection.

   o  Last Good Stream ID: The last Stream ID which was accepted by the
      sender of the GOAWAY message.  If no streams were replied to, this
      value must be set to 0.

   o  Reason Phrase Length: A 16-bit unsigned number specifying the
      length of the reason phrase.  This may be zero if the sender
      chooses to not give details beyond the error code.

   o  Reason Phrase: An optional human-readable explanation for why the
      connection was closed.

11.  Priority

   (TODO: implement)

   QUIC will use the HTTP/2 prioritization mechanism.  Roughly, a stream
   may be dependent on another stream.  In this situation, the "parent"
   stream should effectively starve the "child" stream.  In addition,
   parent streams have an explicit priority.  Parent streams should not
   starve other parent streams, but should make progress proportional to
   their relative priority.

12.  HTTP/2 Layering over QUIC

   Since QUIC integrates various HTTP/2 mechanisms with transport
   mechanisms, QUIC implements a number of features that are also
   specified in HTTP/2.  As a result, QUIC allows HTTP/2 mechanisms to
   be replaced by QUIC's implementation, reducing complexity in the
   HTTP/2 protocol.  This section briefly describes how HTTP/2 semantics
   can be offered over a QUIC implementation.

12.1.  Stream Management

   When HTTP/2 headers and data are sent over QUIC, the QUIC layer
   handles most of the stream management.  HTTP/2 Stream IDs are
   replaced by QUIC Stream IDs.  HTTP/2 does not need to do any explicit
   stream framing when using QUIC---data sent over a QUIC stream simply
   consists of HTTP/2 headers or body.  Requests and responses are



Hamilton, et al.         Expires January 9, 2016               [Page 27]

Internet-Draft                    QUIC                         July 2015


   considered complete when the QUIC stream is closed in the
   corresponding direction.

   Stream flow control is handled by QUIC, and does not need to be re-
   implemented in HTTP/2.  QUIC's flow controller replaces the two
   levels of poorly matched flow controllers in current HTTP/2
   deployments---one at the HTTP/2 level, and the other at the TCP
   level.

12.2.  HTTP/2 Header Compression

   QUIC implements HPACK header compression [3] for HTTP/2, which
   unfortunately introduces some Head-of-Line blocking since HTTP/2
   header blocks must be decompressed in the order they were compressed.

   Since streams may be processed in arbitrary order at a receiver,
   strict ordering across headers is enforced by sending all headers on
   a dedicated headers stream, with Stream ID 3.  An HTTP/2 receiver
   using QUIC would thus process data from a stream only after receiving
   the corresponding header on the headers stream.

   Future work will tweak the compressor and decompressor in QUIC so
   that the compressed output does not depend on unacked previous
   compressed state.  This could be done, perhaps, by creating
   "checkpoints" of HPACK state which are updated when headers have been
   acked.  When compressing headers QUIC would only compress relative to
   the previous "checkpoint".

12.3.  Parsing HTTP/2 Headers

   HTTP/2 uses a SYN stream to create new streams and to negotiate
   various stream parameters, including stream priority.  Since stream
   creation is implicit in QUIC, there is no equivalent of a SYN stream.
   Also, since there is no explicit stream priority in QUIC, the current
   HTTP/2 mapping on QUIC communicates HTTP/2 stream priority by
   prepending it to the beginning of the HTTP/2 headers in the headers
   stream.  Each HTTP/2 header sent on the headers stream is as follows:

        0           3      4          7      8           11   12
   +--------+- ... ---+--------+- ... --+--------+- ... ---+------ ...
   |     Priority     |    Stream ID    |  Headers length  | Headers
   +--------+- ... ---+--------+- ... --+--------+- ... ---+------ ...

   Priority type: A 32-bit unsigned number specifying the stream's
   HTTP/2 priority

   Stream ID: A 32-bit unsigned number specifying the QUIC Stream ID
   associated with this HTTP/2 header

Internet-Draft                    QUIC                         July 2015


   Headers length: A 32-bit unsigned number encoding the length, in
   bytes, of the compressed headers to follow

   Headers: HTTP/2 compressed headers

12.4.  Persistent Connections

   Unlike when using TCP, the underlying connection for QUIC is
   guaranteed to be persistent.  The HTTP "Connection" header is
   therefore does not apply.  For best performance, it is expected that
   clients will not close a QUIC connection until the user navigates
   away from all web pages using that connection, or until the server
   closes the connection.

12.5.  QUIC Negotiation in HTTP

   The Alternate-Protocol header is used to negotiate use of QUIC on
   future HTTP requests.  To specify QUIC as an alternate protocol
   available on port 123, a server uses:

   "Alternate-Protocol: 123:quic"

   When a client receives a Alternate-Protocol header advertising QUIC,
   it can then attempt to use QUIC for future secure connections on that
   domain.  Since middleboxes and/or firewalls can block QUIC and/or UDP
   communication, a client should implement a graceful fallback to TCP
   when QUIC reachability is broken.

   Note that the server may reply with multiple field values or a comma-
   separated field value for Alternate-Protocol to indicate the various
   transports it supports.

   A server can also send a header to notify that QUIC should not be
   used on this domain.  If it sends the alternate-protocol-required
   header, the client should remember to not use QUIC on that domain in
   future, and not do any UDP probing to see if QUIC is available.

13.  Recent Changes By Version

   o  Q009: added priority as the first 4 bytes on spdy streams.

   o  Q010: renumber the various frame types

   o  Q011: shrunk the fnv128 hash on NULL encrypted packets from 16
      bytes to 12 bytes.

   o  Q012: optimize the ack frame format to reduce the size and better
      handle ranges of nacks, which should make truncated acks virtually

      impossible.  Also adding an explicit flag for truncated acks and
      moving the ack outside of the connection close frame.

      change.

   o  Q015: Removes the accumulated_number_of_lost_packets field from
      the TCP and inter arrival congestion feedback frames and adds an
      explicit list of recovered packets to the ack frame.

   o  Q016: Breaks out the sent_info field from the ACK frame into a new
      STOP_WAITING frame.

   o  Changed GUID to Connection ID

   o  Q017: Adds stream level flow control

   o  Q018: Added a PING frame

   o  Q019: Adds session/connection level flow control

   o  Q020: Allow endpoints to set different stream/session flow control
      windows

   o  Q021: Crypto and headers streams are flow controlled (at stream
      level)

   o  Q023: Ack frames include packet timestamps

   o  Q024: HTTP/2-style header compression

   o  Q025: HTTP/2-style header keys.  Removal of error_details from the
