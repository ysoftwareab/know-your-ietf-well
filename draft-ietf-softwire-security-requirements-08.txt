Internet-Draft      Softwire security considerations            May 2009


1.  Introduction

   The Softwire Working Group specifies the standardization of
   discovery, control and encapsulation methods for connecting IPv4
   networks across IPv6 networks and IPv6 networks across IPv4 networks.
   The softwire provides the connectivity to enable global reachability
   of both address families by reusing or extending existing technology.
   The Softwire Working Group is focusing on the two scenarios that
   emerged when discussing the traversal of networks composed of
   differing address families.  This document provides the security
   guidelines for such two softwire solution spaces such as "Hubs and
   Spokes" and "Mesh" scenarios.  "Hubs and Spokes" and "Mesh" problems
   are described in [RFC4925] Section 2 and Section 3, respectively.
   The protocols selected for softwire connectivity require the security
   considerations on more specific deployment scenarios for each
   solution.  The scope of this document provides the analysis on the
   security vulnerabilities for the deployment scenarios and specifies
   the proper usage of the security mechanisms applied to the softwire
   deployment.

   Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TPv2) is selected as phase 1 protocol
   to be deployed in the "Hubs and Spokes" solution space.  If L2TPv2 is
   used in the unprotected network, it will be vulnerable to various
   security attacks and MUST be protected by appropriate security
   protocol such as IPsec described in [RFC3193].  The new
   implementation SHOULD use IKEv2 in the key management protocol for
   IPsec because of more reliable protocol and integration of required
   protocols in a single platform.  This document provides the
   implementation guidance and proper usage of IPsec as the security
   protection mechanism by considering the security vulnerabilities in
   "Hubs and Spokes" scenario.  The document also addresses the cases
   where the security protocol is not necessarily mandated.

   The softwire "Mesh" solution MUST support various levels of security
   mechanism to protect the data packets from an attacker being
   transmitted on a softwire tunnel from the access networks with one
   address family across the transit core operating with different
   address family [RFC4925].  The security mechanism for the control
   plane is also required to be protected from control data
   modification, spoofing attack, etc.  In the "Mesh" solution, BGP is
   used for distributing softwire routing information in the transit
   core while the security issues for BGP is being discussed in other
   working groups.  This document provides the proper usage of the
   security mechanisms for the softwire mesh deployment scenarios.

2.  Terminology

2.1.  Abbreviations

   The terminology is based on the softwire problem statement document
   [RFC4925].

   AF(i) - Address Family.  IPv4 or IPv6.  Notation used to indicate
   that prefixes, a node or network only deal with a single IP AF.

   AF(i,j) - Notation used to indicate that a node is dual-stack or that
   a network is composed of dual-stack nodes.

   Address Family Border Router (AFBR) -A dual-stack router that
   interconnects two networks that use either the same or different
   address families.  An AFBR forms peering relationships with other
   AFBRs, adjacent core routers and attached CE routers, perform
   softwire discovery and signaling, advertises client ASF(i)
   reachability information and encapsulates/decapsulates customer
   packets in softwire transport headers.

   Customer Edge (CE) - A router located inside AF access island that
   peers with other CE routers within the access island network and with
   one or more upstream AFBRs.

   Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) - An equipment, host or router,
   located at a subscriber's premises and connected with a carrier's
   access network.

   Provider Edge (PE) - A router located at the edge of transit core
   network that interfaces with CE in access island.

   Softwire Concentrator (SC) - The node terminating the softwire in the
   service provider network.

   Softwire Initiator (SI) - The node initiating the softwire within the
   customer network.

   Softwire Encapsulation Set (SW-Encap) - A softwire encapsulation set
   contains tunnel header parameters, order of preference of the tunnel
   header types and the expected payload types (e.g.  IPv4) carried
   inside the softwire.

   Softwire Next_Hop (SW-NHOP) - This attribute accompanies client AF
   reachability advertisements and is used to reference a softwire on
   the ingress AFBR leading to the specific prefixes.  It contains a
   softwire identifier value and a softwire next_hop IP address denoted
   as <SW ID:SW-NHOP address>.  Its existence in the presence of client

   AF prefixes (in advertisements or entries in a routing table) infers
   the use of softwire to reach that prefix.

2.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Hubs and Spokes Security Guidelines

3.1.  Deployment Scenarios

   To provide the security guidelines, the discussion of the possible
   deployment scenario and the trust relationship in the network is
   important.

   The softwire initiator (SI) always resides in the customer network.
   The node, in which the SI resides, can be the CPE access device,
   another dedicated CPE router behind the original CPE access device or
   any kind of host device such as PC, appliance, sensor etc.

   However, the host device may not always have direct access to its
   home carrier network, to which the user has subscribed.  For example,
   the SI in the laptop PC can access various access networks such as
   Wi-Fi hot-spots, visited office network.  This is the nomadic case,
   which the softwire SHOULD support.

   As the softwire deployment model, the following three cases as shown
   in Figure 1 should be considered.  Case 2 and 3 are typical for a
   nomadic node, but are also applicable to a stationary node.  In order
   to securely connect legitimate SI and SC each other, the
   authentication process between SI and SC is performed normally using
   AAA servers.

            Figure 1: Authentication model for Hubs and Spokes

   The AAA server shown in Figure 1 interacts with the SC which acts as
   an AAA client.  The AAA may consists of multiple AAA servers and the
   proxy AAA may be intermediate between the SC and the AAA servers.
   This document refers to the AAA server in the home network service
   provider as the home AAA server (AAAh) and that in the visited
   network service provider as the visited AAA server (AAAv).

   The softwire problem statement [RFC4925] states that the softwire
   solution must be able to be integrated with common deployed AAA
   solution.  L2TPv2 used in softwire supports PPP and L2TP
   authentications which can be integrated with common AAA servers.

   When the softwire is used in an unprotected network, a stronger
   authentication process is required (e.g., IKEv2).  The proper
   selection of the authentication processes is discussed in Section 3.4
   with respect to the various security threats.

   Case 1: The SI connects to the SC that belongs to the home network
   service provider via the home access provider network operating
   different address family.  It is assumed that the home access network
   and the home network providing SC are under the same administrative
   system.

   Note that the IP address of the host device, in which SI resides, is
   static or dynamic depending on the subscribed service.  The discovery
   of the SC may be automatic.  But in this document, the information on
   the SC, e.g. the DNS name or IP address, is assumed to be configured
   by the user or the provider of the SI in advance.

   Case 2: The SI connects to the SC that belongs to the home network
   service provider network via the visited access network.  For the
   nomadic case, the SI/user does not subscribe to the visited access
   provider.  For the network access through the public network such as
   WiFi hot-spots, the home network service provider does not have the
   trust relationship with the access network.

   Note that the IP address of the host device, in which SI resides, may
   be changed periodically due to the home network service provider's
   policy.

   Case 3: The SI connects to the SC that belongs to the visited network
   service provider via the visited access network.  This is typical of
   nomadic access case.  When the SI is mobile, it may roam from the
   home ISP providing the home access network to the visited access
   network, e.g.  WiFi hot-spot network provided by the different ISP.
   The SI does not connect to the SC in the home network, for example,
   due to the geographical reason.  The SI/user does not subscribe to
   the visited network service provider, but the visited network service
   provider has some roaming agreement with the home network service
   provider.

   Note that the IP address of the host, in which SI resides, is
   provided the visited network service provider's policy.

3.2.  Trust Relationship

   The establishment of the trust relationship between SI and SC is
   different for three cases.  The security consideration must be taken
   into account for each case.

   In Case 1, the SC and the home AAA server in the same network service
   provider MUST have a trust relationship and communications between
   them MUST be secured.  When the SC authenticates the SI, the SC
   transmits the authentication request message to the home AAA server
   and obtains the accept message together with the Attribute Value Pair



Yamamoto, et al.        Expires November 23, 2009               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft      Softwire security considerations            May 2009


   for the SI authentication.  Since the SI in the service provider
   network, the provider can take measures to protect the entities
   (e.g., SC, AAA servers) against a number of security threats,
   including the communication between them.

   In Case 2, when the SI is mobile, the access to the home network
   service provider through the visited access network provider is
   allowed.  The trust relationship between SI and the SC in the home
   network MUST be established.  When the visited access network is a
   public network, the various security attacks must be considered.
   Especially for SI to connect to the legitimate SC, the authentication
   from SI to SC MUST be performed together with that from SC to SI.

   In Case3, if the SI roams into a different network service provider's
   administrative domain and the visited AAA server communicates with
   the home AAA server to obtain the information for SI authentication.
   The visited AAA server MUST have a trust relationship with the home
   AAA server and the communication between them MUST be secured in
   order to properly perform the roaming services that have been agreed
   upon under specified conditions.

   Note that the path for the communications between the home AAA server
   and the visited AAA server may consist of several AAA proxies.  In
   this case, AAA proxy threat model SHOULD be considered [RFC2607].  A
   malicious AAA proxy may launch passive or active security attacks.
   The trustworthiness of proxies in AAA proxy chains will be weaken
   when the hop counts of the proxy chain is longer.  For example, the
   accounting information exchanged among AAA proxies is attractive for
   an adversary.  The communication between a home AAA server and a
   visited AAA server MUST be protected.

3.3.  Softwire Security Threat Scenarios

   Softwire can be used to connect IPv6 networks across public IPv4
   networks and IPv4 networks across public IPv6 networks.  The control
   and data packets used during the softwire session are vulnerable to
   the security attacks.

   A complete threat analysis of softwire requires examination of the
   protocols used for the softwire setup, the encapsulation method used
   to transport the payload, and other protocols used for configuration
   (e.g., router advertisements, DHCP).

   The softwire solution uses a subset of the Layer Two Tunneling
   Protocol (L2TPv2) functionality [RFC2661],
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-hs-framework-l2tpv2].  In the softwire "Hubs and
   Spokes" model, L2TPv2 is used in a voluntary tunnel model only.  The
   SI acts as a L2TP Access Concentrator (LAC) and PPP endpoint.  The



Yamamoto, et al.        Expires November 23, 2009               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft      Softwire security considerations            May 2009


   L2TPv2 tunnel is always initiated from the SI.,

   Generic threat analysis done for L2TP using IPsec [RFC3193] is
   applicable to softwire "Hubs and Spokes" deployment.  The threat
   analysis for other protocols such as MIPv6 [RFC4225], PANA [RFC4016],
   NSIS [RFC4081], and Routing Protocols [RFC4593] are applicable here
   as well and should be used as references.

   First, the SI resided in the customer network sends Start-Control-
   Connection-Request(SCCRQ) packet to the SC for the initiation of the
   softwire.  L2TPv2 offers an optional CHAP-like tunnel authentication
   system during control connection establishment.  This requires a
   shared secret between the SI and SC and no key management is offered
   for this L2TPv2.

   When L2TPv2 control connection is established, the SI and SC
   optionally enter authentication phase after completing PPP Link
   Control Protocol (LCP) negotiation.  PPP authentication supports one
   way or two way CHAP authentication, and can leverage existing AAA
   infrastructure.  PPP authentication does not provide per-packet
   authentication.

   PPP encryption is defined but PPP Encryption Control Protocol (ECP)
   negotiation does not provide for a protected cipher suite
   negotiation.  PPP encryption provides a weak security solution
   [RFC3193].  PPP ECP implementation cannot be expected.  PPP
   authentication also does not provide the scalable key management.

   Once the L2TPv2 tunnel and PPP configuration are successfully
   established, the SI is connected and can start using the connection.

   These steps are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM), denial of
   service (DoS), and service theft attacks, which are caused as the
   consequence of the following adversary actions.

   Adversary attacks on softwire include:

   1.  An adversary may try to discover identities by snooping data
       packets.

   2.  An adversary may try to modify both control and data packets.
       This type of attack involves integrity violations.

   3.  An adversary may try to eavesdrop and collect control messages.
       By replaying these messages, an adversary may successfully hijack
       the L2TP tunnel or the PPP connection inside the tunnel.  An
       adversary might mount MITM, DOS, and theft of service attacks.

Internet-Draft      Softwire security considerations            May 2009


   4.  An adversary can flood the softwire node with bogus signaling
       messages to cause DoS attacks by terminating L2TP tunnels or PPP
       connections.

   5.  An adversary may attempt to disrupt the softwire negotiation in
       order to weaken or remove confidentiality protection.

   6.  An adversary may wish to disrupt the PPP LCP authentication
       negotiation.

   In environments where the link is shared without the cryptographic
   protection and the weak authentication or one-way authentication is
   used, these security attacks can be mounted on softwire control and
   data packets.

   When there is no prior trust relationship between the SI and SC, any
   node can pretend to be a SC.  In this case, an adversary may
   impersonate the SC to intercept traffic (e.g. "rogue" softwire
   concentrator).

   The rogue SC can introduce a denial of service attack by blackholing
   packets from the SI.  The rogue SC can also eavesdrop on all packets
   sent from or to the SI.  Security threats of a rogue SC are similar
   to a compromised router.

   The deployment of ingress filtering is able to control the malicious
   users' access [RFC4213].  Without specific ingress filtering checks
   in the decapsulator at the SC, it would be possible for an attacker
   to inject a false packet, leaving the system vulnerable to attacks
   such as DoS.  The inner address ingress filtering can reject invalid
   inner source address.  Without inner address ingress filtering,
   another kind of attack can happen.  The malicious users from another
   ISP could start using its tunneling infrastructure to get free inner
   address connectivity, transforming effectively the ISP into an inner
   address transit provider.

   While the ingress filtering does not provide the complete protection
   in the case an address spoofing has been happened.  In order to
   provide better protection against address spoofing, authentication
   with binding between the legitimate address and the authenticated
   identity MUST be implemented.  This can be implemented between the SC
   and the SI using IPsec.

3.4.  Softwire Security Guidelines

   Based on the security threat analysis in Section 3.3 in this
   document, the softwire security protocol MUST support the following
   protections.

Internet-Draft      Softwire security considerations            May 2009


   1.  Softwire control messages between the SI and SC MUST be protected
       against eavesdropping and spoofing attacks.

   2.  Softwire security protocol MUST be able to protect itself against
       replay attacks.

   3.  Softwire security protocol MUST be able to protect the device
       identifier against the impersonation when it is exchanged between
       the SI and the SC.

   4.  Softwire security protocol MUST be able to securely bind the
       authenticated session to the device identifier of the client, to
       prevent service theft.

   5.  Softwire security protocol MUST be able to protect disconnect and
       revocation messages.

   The softwire security protocol requirement is comparable to
   [RFC3193].

   For softwire control packets, authentication, integrity and replay
   protection MUST be supported and confidentiality SHOULD be supported.

   For softwire data packets, authentication, integrity and replay
   protection SHOULD be supported and confidentiality MAY be supported.

   The softwire problem statement [RFC4925] provides some requirements
   for "Hubs and Spoke" solution that are taken into account in defining
   the security protection mechanisms.

   1.  Control and/or data plane MUST be able to provide full payload
       security when desired.

   2.  Deployed technology MUST be very strongly considered.

   This additional security protection must be separable from the
   softwire tunneling mechanism.

   Note that the scope of the security is on the L2TP tunnel between the
   SI and SC.  If end-to-end security is required, a security protocol
   SHOULD be used in the payload packets.  But this is out of scope of
   this document.

3.4.1.  Authentication

   The softwire security protocol MUST support user authentication in
   the control plane, in order to authorize access to the service, and
   provide adequate logging of activity.  Although several



Yamamoto, et al.        Expires November 23, 2009              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft      Softwire security considerations            May 2009


   authentication protocols are available, the security threats must be
   considered to choose the protocol.

   For example, the SI/user using Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)
   access to the SC with the cleartext password.  In many circumstances,
   this represents a large security risk.  The adversary may spoof as a
   legitimate user by using the stolen password.  Challenge Handshake
   Authentication Protocol (CHAP) [RFC1994] encrypts a password with
   "challenge" sent from the SC.  The theft of password can be
   mitigated.  However, as CHAP only supports unidirectional
   authentication, the risk of a man-in-the-middle or rogue SC cannot be
   avoided.  Extensible Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer Security
   (EAP-TLS) [RFC5216] mandates mutual authentication and avoid the
   rogue SC.

   When the SI established a connection to the SC through a public
   network, the SI may want to a proof of the SC identity.  Softwire
   MUST support mutual authentication to allow for such scenario.

   In some circumstances, however, the service provider may decide to
   allow non-authenticated connection
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-hs-framework-l2tpv2].  For example, when the
   customer is already authenticated by some other means, such as closed
   networks, cellular networks at Layer 2, etc., the service provider
   may decide to turn authentication off.  If no authentication is
   conducted on any layer, the SC acts as a gateway for anonymous
   connections.  Running such a service MUST be configurable by the SC
   administrator and the SC SHOULD take some security measures such as
   ingress filtering and adequate logging of activity.  It should be
   noted that anonymous connection service cannot provide the security
   functionalities described in this document (e.g. integrity, replay
   protection and confidentiality).

   L2TPv2 selected as Softwire phase 1 protocol supports PPP
   authentication and L2TPv2 authentication.  PPP authentication and
   L2TPv2 have various security threats as stated in Section 3.3.  They
   will be used in the limited condition as described in the next
   subsections.

3.4.1.1.  PPP Authentication

   PPP can provide mutual authentication between the SI and SC using
   CHAP [RFC1994] during the connection establishment phase (Link
   Control Protocol, LCP).  PPP CHAP authentication can be used when the
   SI and SC are on a trusted, non-public IP network.

   Since CHAP does not provide per-packet authentication, integrity, or
   replay protection, PPP CHAP authentication MUST NOT be used for



Yamamoto, et al.        Expires November 23, 2009              [Page 12]

Internet-Draft      Softwire security considerations            May 2009


   unprotected on a public IP network.  If other appropriate protected
   mechanism has been already applied, PPP CHAP authentication MAY be
   used.

   Optionally, other authentication methods such as PAP, MS-CHAP EAP MAY
   be supported.

3.4.1.2.  L2TPv2 Authentication

   L2TPv2 provides an optional CHAP-like tunnel authentication during
   the control connection establishment [RFC2661, 5.1.1].  L2TPv2
   authentication MUST NOT be used for unprotected on a public IP
   network as the same restriction applied to PPP CHAP.

3.4.2.  Softwire Security Protocol

   To meet the above requirements, all softwire security compliant
   implementations MUST implement the following security protocols.

   IPsec ESP [RFC4303] in transport mode is used for securing softwire
   control and data packets.  Internet Key Exchange (IKE)
   protocol[RFC4306] MUST be supported for authentication, security
   association negotiation and key management for IPsec.  The
   applicability of different version of IKE is discussed in Section
   3.5.

   The softwire security protocol MUST support NAT traversal.  UDP
   encapsulation of IPsec ESP packets[RFC3948] and negotiation of NAT-
   traversal in IKE[RFC3947] MUST be supported when IPsec is used.

3.5.  Guidelines for Usage of IPsec in Softwire

   When softwire "Hubs and Spokes" solution implemented by L2TPv2 is
   used in untrustworthy network, softwire MUST be protected by
   appropriate security protocol such as IPsec.  This section provides
   guidelines for the usage of IPsec in L2TPv2 based softwire.

   [RFC3193] discusses how L2TP can use IKE [RFC2409] and IPsec
   [RFC2401] to provide tunnel authentication, privacy protection,
   integrity checking and replay protection.  Since its publication, the
   revision to IPsec protocols have been published (IKEv2 [RFC4306], ESP
   [RFC4303], NAT-traversal for IKE [RFC3947] and ESP[RFC3948]).

   Given that deployed technology must be very strongly considered
   [RFC4925] for the 'time-to-market' solution, [RFC3193] MUST be
   supported.  However, the new implementation SHOULD use IKEv2
   [RFC4306] for IPsec because of the numerous advantages over IKE
   [RFC2409].  In new deployments, IKEv2 SHOULD be used as well.



Yamamoto, et al.        Expires November 23, 2009              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft      Softwire security considerations            May 2009


   Although [RFC3193] can be applied in the softwire "Hubs and Spokes"
   solution, softwire requirements such as NAT-traversal, NAT-traversal
   for IKE [RFC3947] and ESP [RFC3948] MUST be supported.

   Meanwhile, IKEv2 [RFC4306] integrates NAT-traversal.  IKEv2 also
   supports EAP authentication with the authentication using shared
   secrets (pre-shared key) or public key signature (certificate).

   The selection of pre-shared key and certificate depends on the scale
   of the network for softwire to be deployed as described in Section
   3.5.2.  However, pre-shared key and certificates only support the
   machine authentication.  When both machine and user authentications
   are required, for example, in the nomadic case, EAP SHOULD be used.

   Together with EAP, IKEv2 [RFC4306] supports legacy authentication
   methods that may be useful in environments where username and
   password based authentication is already deployed.

   IKEv2 is more reliable protocol than IKE [RFC2409]in terms of the
   replay protection capability, DoS protection enabled mechanism etc.
   Therefore, new implementations SHOULD use IKEv2 over IKE.

   The following sections will discuss using IPsec to protect L2TPv2 as
   applied in the softwire "Hubs and Spokes" model.  Unless otherwise
   stated, IKEv2 and the new IPsec architecture [RFC4301] is assumed.

3.5.1.  Authentication Issues

   IPsec implementation using IKE only supports machine authentication.
   There is no way to verify a user identity and to segregate the tunnel
   traffic among users in the multi-user machine environment.  IKEv2 can
   support user authentication with EAP payload by leveraging existing
   authentication infrastructure and credential database.  This enables
   the traffic segregation among users when user authentication is used
   by combining the legacy authentication.  The user identity asserted
   within IKEv2 will be verified on a per-packet basis.

   If the AAA server is involved in security association establishment
   between the SI and SC, a session key can be derived from the
   authentication between the SI and the AAA server.  Successful EAP
   exchanges within IKEv2 runs between the SI and the AAA server create
   a session key and it is securely transferred to the SC from the AAA
   server.  The trust relationship between the involved entities follows
   Section 3.2 of this document.

3.5.2.  IPsec Pre-Shared Keys for Authentication

   With IPsec, when the identity asserted in IKE is authenticated, the



Yamamoto, et al.        Expires November 23, 2009              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft      Softwire security considerations            May 2009


   resulting derived keys are used to provide per-packet authentication,
   integrity and replay protection.  As a result, the identity verified
   in the IKE is subsequently verified on reception of each packet.

   Authentication using pre-shared keys can be used when the number of
   SI and SC is small.  As the number of SI and SC grows, pre-shared
   keys becomes increasingly difficult to manage.  A softwire security
   protocol MUST provide a scalable approach to key management.
   Whenever possible, authentication with certificates is preferred.

   When pre-shared keys are used, group pre-shared keys MUST NOT be used
   because of its vulnerability to Man-In-The-Middle attacks ([RFC3193],
   5.1.4).

3.5.3.  Inter-Operability Guidelines

   The L2TPv2/IPsec inter-operability concerning tunnel teardown,
   fragmentation and per-packet security checks given in ([RFC3193]
   section 3) must be taken into account.

   Although the L2TP specification allows the responder (SC in softwire)
   to use a new IP address or to change the port number when sending the
   Start-Control-Connection-Request-Reply (SCCRP), a softwire
   concentrator implementation SHOULD NOT do this ([RFC3193] section 4).

   However, with some reasons, for example, "load-balancing" between
   SCs, the IP address change is required.  To signal an IP address
   change, the SC sends a StopCCN message to the SI using the Result and
   Error Code AVP in L2TPv2 message.  A new IKE_SA and CHILD_SA MUST be
   established to the new IP address.

   Since ESP transport mode is used, the UDP header carrying the L2TP
   packet will have an incorrect checksum due to the change of parts of
   the IP header during transit.  [RFC3948] section 3.1.2 defines 3
   procedures that can be used to fix the checksum.  A softwire
   implementation MUST NOT use the "incremental update of checksum"
   (option 1 described in[RFC3948]), because the IKEv2 does not have the
   information required (NAT-OA payload) to compute that checksum.
   Since ESP is already providing validation on the L2TP packet, a
   simple approach is to use the "do not check" approach (option 3 in
   [RFC3948]).

3.5.4.  IPsec Filtering Details

   If the old IPsec architecture [RFC2401] and IKE [RFC2409] are used,
   the security policy database (SPD) examples in [RFC3193] appendix A
   can be applied to softwire model.  In that case, the initiator is
   always the client (SI), and responder is the SC.  IPsec SPD examples



Yamamoto, et al.        Expires November 23, 2009              [Page 15]

Internet-Draft      Softwire security considerations            May 2009


   for IKE [RFC2409] are also given in appendix A of this document.

   The revised IPsec architecture [RFC4301] redefined the SPD entries to
   provide more flexibility (multiple selectors per entry, list of
   address range, peer authentication database (PAD), "populate from
   packet"(PFP) flag, etc.).  The Internet Key Exchange (IKE) has also
   been revised and simplified in IKEv2 [RFC4306].  The following
   sections provides the SPD examples for softwire to use the revised
   IPsec architecture and IKEv2.

3.5.4.1.  IPv6 over IPv4 Softwire L2TPv2 example for IKEv2

   If IKEv2 is used as the key management protocol, RFC4301 provides the
   guidance of the SPD entries.  In IKEv2, we can use PFP flag to
   specify SA and the port number can be selected with Traffic Selector
   with TSr during CREATE_CHILD_SA.  The following describes PAD entries
   on the SI and SC, respectively.  The PAD entries are only example
   configurations.  The PAD entry on the SC matches user identities to
   the L2TP SPD entry.  This is done using a symbolic name type
   specified in [RFC4301].

   SI PAD:
   - IF remote_identity = SI_identity
        Then authenticate (shared secret/certificate/)
        and authorize CHILD_SA for remote address SC_address

   SC PAD:
   - IF remote_identity = user_1
        Then authenticate (shared secret/certificate/EAP)
        and authorize CHILD_SAs for symbolic name "l2tp_spd_entry"

   The following describes the SPD entries for the SI and SC,
   respectively.  Note that IKEv2 and ESP traffic MUST be allowed
   (bypass).  These include IP protocol 50 and UDP port 500 and 4500.

   The IPv4 packet format of ESP protecting L2TPv2 carrying IPv6 packet
   is shown in Table 1 by using the similar Table in [RFC4891].

4.  Mesh Security Guidelines

4.1.  Deployment Scenario

   In the softwire "Mesh" solution[RFC4925],
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-mesh-framework], it is required to establish
   connectivity to access network islands of one address family type
   across a transit core of a differing address family type.  To provide
   reachability across the transit core, AFBRs are installed between
   access network island and transit core network.  These AFBRs can
   perform as Provider Edge routers (PE) within an autonomous system or
   perform peering across autonomous systems.  The AFBRs establish and
   encapsulate softwires in a mesh to the other islands across the
   transit core network.  The transit core network consists of one or
   more service providers.

   In the softwire "Mesh" solution, a pair of PE routers (AFBRs) use BGP
   to exchange routing information.  AFBR nodes in the transit network
   are Internal BGP speakers and will peer with each other directly or
   via a route reflector to exchange SW-encap sets, perform softwire
   signaling, and advertise AF access island reachability information
   and SW-NHOP information.  If such information is advertised within an
   autonomous system, the AFBR node receiving them from other AFBRs does
   not forward them to other AFBR nodes.  To exchange the information
   among AFBRs, the full mesh connectivity will be established.

   The connectivity between CE and PE routers includes dedicated
   physical circuits, logical circuits (such as Frame Relay and ATM),
   and shared medium access (such as Ethernet-based access).

   When AFBRs are PE routers located at the edge of the provider core
   networks, this is similar architecture of the L3VPN described in
   [RFC4364].  The connectivity between a CE router in access island
   network and a PE router in transit network is established by static
   way.  The access islands are enterprise networks accommodated through
   PE routers in the provider's transit network.  In this case, the



Yamamoto, et al.        Expires November 23, 2009              [Page 19]

Internet-Draft      Softwire security considerations            May 2009


   access island networks are administrated by the provider's autonomous
   system.

   The AFBRs may have the multiple connections to the core network, and
   also may have the connections to the multiple client access networks.
   The client access networks may connect each other through private
   networks or through the Internet.  When the client access networks
   have their own AS number, a CE router located inside access islands
   forms a private BGP peering with an AFBR.  Further, an AFBR may need
   to exchange a full Internet routing information with each network to
   which it connects.

4.2.  Trust Relationship

   All AFBR nodes in the transit core MUST have a trust relationship or
   an agreement with each other to establish softwires.  When the
   transit core consists of a single administrative domain, it is
   assumed that all nodes (e.g.  AFBR, PE or Route Reflector, if
   applicable) are trusted with each other.

   If the transit core consists of multiple administrative domains,
   intermediate routers between AFBRs may not be trusted.

   There MUST be a trust relationship between the PE in the transit core
   and the CE in the corresponding island, although the link(s) between
   the PE and the CE may not be protected.

4.3.  Softwire Security Threat Scenarios

   As the architecture of softwire mesh solution is very similar to that
   of the provider provisioned VPN (PPVPN).  The security threats
   considerations on the PPVPN operation are applicable to those in the
   softwire mesh solution [RFC4111].

   Examples of attacks to data packets being transmitted on a softwire
   tunnel include:

   1.  An adversary may try to discover confidential information by
       sniffing softwire packets.

   2.  An adversary may try to modify the contents of softwire packets.

   3.  An adversary may try to spoof the softwire packets that do not
       belong the authorized domains and to insert copies of once-
       legitimate packets that have been recorded and replayed.

   4.  An adversary can launch Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack by

       exhaustion type can be mounted against the data plane by spoofing
       a large amount of non-authenticated data into the softwire from
       the outside of the softwire tunnel.

   5.  An adversary may try to sniff softwire packets and to examine
       aspects or meta-aspects of them that may be visible even when the
       packets themselves are encrypted.  An attacker might gain useful
       information based on the amount and timing of traffic, packet
       sizes, sources and destination addresses, etc.

   The security attacks can be mounted on the control plane as well.  In
   softwire mesh solution, softwires encapsulation will be set up by
   using BGP.  As described in [RFC4272], BGP is vulnerable to various
   security threats such as confidential violation, replay attacks,
   insertion, deletion and modification of BGP messages, main-in-the-
   middle, and denial-of-service.

4.4.  Applicability of Security Protection Mechanism

   Given that security is generally a compromise between expense and
   risk, it is also useful to consider the likelihood of different
   attacks.  There is at least a perceived difference in the likelihood
   of most types of attacks being successfully mounted in different
   deployment.

   The trust relationship among users in access networks, transit core
   provider, and other parts of networks described in section 4.2 is a
   key element in determining the applicability of security protection
   mechanism for the specific softwire mesh deployment.

4.4.1.  Security Protection Mechanism for Control Plane

   The Softwire Problem Statement [RFC4925] states that the softwire
   mesh setup mechanism to advertise the softwire encapsulation MUST
   support authentication, but the transit core provider may decide to
   turn it off in some circumstances.

   The BGP authentication mechanism is specified in [RFC2385].  The
   mechanism defined in [RFC2385] is based on a one-way hash function
   (MD5) and use of a secret key.  The key is shared between a pair of
   peer routers and is used to generate 16-byte message authentication
   code values that are not readily computed by an attacker who does not
   have access to the key.

   However the security mechanism for BGP transport (e.g.  TCP-MD5) is
   inadequate in some circumstances and also requires operator
   interaction to maintain a respectable level of security.  The current
   deployments of TCP-MD5 exhibit some shortcomings with respect of key

   management as described in [RFC3562].

   Key management can be especially cumbersome for operators.  The
   number of keys required and the maintenance of keys (issue/revoke/
   renew) has had an additive effect as a barrier to deployment.  Thus
   automated means of managing keys, to reduce operational burdens, is
   available in BGP security system [I-D.ietf-rpsec-bgpsecrec],
   [RFC4107].

   Use of IPsec counters the message insertion, deletion, and
   modification attacks, as well as man-in-the-middle attacks by
   outsiders.  If routing data confidentiality is desired, the use of
   IPsec ESP could provide that service.  If eavesdropping attack is
   identified as a threat, ESP can be used to provide confidentiality
   (encryption), integrity and authentication for the BGP session.

4.4.2.  Security Protection Mechanism for Data Plane

   To transport data packets across the transit core, the mesh solution
   defines multiple encapsulations: L2TPv3, IP-in-IP, MPLS (LDP-based
   and RSVP-TE based), and GRE.  To securely transport such data packet,
   the softwire MUST support IPsec tunnel.

   IPsec can provide authentication and integrity.  The implementation
   MUST support ESP with null encryption [RFC4303] or else AH (IP
   Authentication Header) [RFC4302].  If some part of the transit core
   network is not trusted, ESP with encryption MAY be applied.

   Since the softwires are created dynamically by BGP, the automated key
   distribution MUST be performed by IKEv2 [RFC4306] with either pre-
   shared key or public key management.  For the dynamic softwire IPsec
   tunnel creation, pre-shared key will be same in all routers.  Namely
   pre-shared key indicates here group key instead of pairwise shared
   key.

   If security policy requires a stronger key management, the public key
   SHOULD be used.  If a public key infrastructure is not available, the
   IPsec Tunnel Authentication sub-TLV specified in
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-encaps-ipsec] MUST be used before SA is
   established.

   If the link(s) between the user's site and the provider's PE is not
   trusted, then encryption MAY be used on the PE-CE link(s).

   Together with the cryptographic security protection, the access
   control technique reduces the exposure to attacks from outside the
   service provider networks (transit networks).  The access control
   technique includes packet-by-packet or packet flow-by-packet flow

   access control by means of filters as well as by means of admitting a
   session for a control/signaling/management protocol that is being
   used to implement softwire mesh.

   The access control technique is an important protection against
   security attacks of DoS etc. and a necessary adjunct to cryptographic
   strength in encapsulation.  Packets that match the criteria
   associated with a particular filter may be either discarded or given
   special treatment to prevent an attack or to mitigate the effect of a
   possible future attack.


5.  Security Considerations

   This document discusses various security threats for the softwire
   control and data packets in "Hubs and Spokes" and "Mesh" time-to-
   market solutions.  With these discussions, the softwire security
   protocol implementations are provided referencing to Softwire Problem
   Statement [RFC4925], Securing L2TP using IPsec [RFC3193], Security
   Framework for PPVPNs [RFC4111], and Guidelines for Mandating the Use
   of IPsec [RFC5406].  The guidelines for the security protocol
   employment are also given considering the specific deployment
   context.

   Note that this document discusses the softwire tunnel security
   protection and does not address the end-to-end protection.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document creates no new requirements on IANA namespaces
   [RFC5226].

Appendix A.

   If the old IPsec architecture [RFC2401] and IKE [RFC2409] are used,
   the SPD examples in [RFC3193] is applicable to "Hub & Spokes" model.
   In this model, the initiator is always the client (SI) and the
   responder is the SC.

A.1.  IPv6 over IPv4 Softwire with L2TPv2 example for IKE

   IPv4 addresses of the softwire initiator and concentrator are denoted
   by IPv4-SI and IPv4-SC, respectively.  If NAT traversal is used in
   IKE, UDP source and destination ports are 4500.  In this SPD entry,
   IKE refers to UDP port 500. * denotes wildcard and indicates ANY port
   or address.
