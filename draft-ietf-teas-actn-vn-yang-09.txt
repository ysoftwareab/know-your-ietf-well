1.  Introduction

   This document provides a YANG [RFC7950] data model generally
   applicable to any mode of Virtual Network (VN) operation.

Internet-Draft                VN YANG Model                    July 2020


   The VN model defined in this document is applicable in generic sense
   as an independent model in and of itself.  The VN model defined in
   this document can also work together with other customer service
   models such as L3SM [RFC8299], L2SM [RFC8466] and L1CSM
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-l1csm-yang] to provide a complete life-cycle service
   management and operations.

   The YANG model discussed in this document basically provides the
   following:

   o  Characteristics of Access Points (APs) that describe customer's
      end point characteristics;

   o  Characteristics of Virtual Network Access Points (VNAP) that
      describe how an AP is partitioned for multiple VNs sharing the AP
      and its reference to a Link Termination Point (LTP) of the
      Provider Edge (PE) Node;

   o  Characteristics of Virtual Networks (VNs) that describe the
      customer's VN in terms of multiple VN Members comprising a VN,
      multi- source and/or multi-destination characteristics of the VN
      Member, the VN's reference to TE-topology's Abstract Node;

   The actual VN instantiation and computation is performed with
   Connectivity Matrices sub-module of TE-Topology Model
   [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te-topo] which provides TE network topology
   abstraction and management operation.  Once TE-topology Model is used
   in triggering VN instantiation over the networks, TE-tunnel
   [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te] Model will inevitably interact with TE-
   Topology model for setting up actual tunnels and LSPs under the
   tunnels.

   Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks (ACTN)
   describes a set of management and control functions used to operate
   one or more TE networks to construct virtual networks that can be
   represented to customers and that are built from abstractions of the
   underlying TE networks [RFC8453].  ACTN is the primary example of the
   usage of the VN YANG model.

   Sections 2 and 3 provide the discussion of how the VN YANG model is
   applicable to the ACTN context where Virtual Network Service (VNS)
   operation is implemented for the Customer Network Controller (CNC)-
   Multi-Domain Service Coordinator (MSDC) interface (CMI).

   The YANG model on the CMI is also known as customer service model in
   [RFC8309].  The YANG model discussed in this document is used to
   operate customer-driven VNs during the VN instantiation, VN
   computation, and its life-cycle service management and operations.

   The VN operational state is included in the same tree as the
   configuration consistent with Network Management Datastore
   Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342].  The origin of the data is indicated
   as per the origin metadata annotation.

2.  Use-case of VN YANG Model in the ACTN context

   In this section, ACTN is being used to illustrate the general usage
   of the VN YANG model.  The model presented in this section has the
   following ACTN context.

                             +-------+
                             |  CNC  |
                             +-------+
                                 |
                                 |    VN YANG + TE-topology YANG
                                 |
                      +-----------------------+
                      |         MDSC          |
                      +-----------------------+

                            Figure 1: ACTN CMI

   Both ACTN VN YANG and TE-topology models are used over the CMI to
   establish a VN over TE networks.

2.1.  Type 1 VN

   As defined in [RFC8453], a Virtual Network is a customer view of the
   TE network.  To recapitulate VN types from [RFC8453], Type 1 VN is
   defined as follows:

   The VN can be seen as a set of edge-to-edge abstract links (a Type 1
   VN).  Each abstract link is referred to as a VN member and is formed
   as an end-to-end tunnel across the underlying networks.  Such tunnels
   may be constructed by recursive slicing or abstraction of paths in
   the underlying networks and can encompass edge points of the
   customer's network, access links, intra-domain paths, and inter-
   domain links.

   If we were to create a VN where we have four VN-members as follows:

                  VN-Member 1       L1-L4
                  VN-Member 2       L1-L7
                  VN-Member 3       L2-L4
                  VN-Member 4       L3-L8

          Where L1, L2, L3, L4, L7 and L8 correspond to a Customer End-
          Point, respectively.

   This VN can be modeled as one abstract node representation as follows
   in Figure 2:

Internet-Draft                VN YANG Model                    July 2020


                        +---------------+
               L1 ------|               |------ L4
               L2 ------|     AN 1      |------ L7
               L3 ------|               |------ L8
                        +---------------+

                Figure 2: Abstract Node (One node topology)

   Modeling a VN as one abstract node is the easiest way for customers
   to express their end-to-end connectivity; however, customers are not
   limited to express their VN only with one abstract node.

2.2.  Type 2 VN

   For some VN members of a VN, the customers are allowed to configure
   the actual path (i.e., detailed virtual nodes and virtual links) over
   the VN/abstract topology agreed mutually between CNC and MDSC prior
   to or a topology created by the MDSC as part of VN instantiation.
   Type 1 VN is a higher abstraction of a Type 2 VN.

   If a Type 2 VN is desired for some or all of VN members of a type 1
   VN (see the example in Section 2.1), the TE-topology model can
   provide the following abstract topology (that consists of virtual
   nodes and virtual links) which is built under the Type 1 VN.

              +----------------------------------------------+
              |             S1               S2              |

              |    \                     \         \         |
              |     \ S6                  \ S7      \ S8     |

   As you see from Figure 3, the Type 1 abstract node is depicted as a
   Type 1 abstract topology comprising of detailed virtual nodes and
   virtual links.

   As an example, if VN-member 1 (L1-L4) is chosen to configure its own
   path over Type 2 topology, it can select, say, a path that consists
   of the ERO {S3,S4,S5} based on the topology and its service
   requirement.  This capability is enacted via TE-topology
   configuration by the customer.

3.  High-Level Control Flows with Examples

3.1.  Type 1 VN Illustration

   If we were to create a VN where we have four VN-members as follows:

                  VN-Member 1       L1-L4
                  VN-Member 2       L1-L7
                  VN-Member 3       L2-L4
                  VN-Member 4       L3-L8

   Where L1, L2, L3, L4, L7 and L8 correspond to Access Points.

   This VN can be modeled as one abstract node representation as
   follows:

                        +---------------+
               L1 ------|               |------ L4
               L2 ------|     AN 1      |------ L7
               L3 ------|               |------ L8
                        +---------------+

   If this VN is Type 1, the following diagram shows the message flow
   between CNC and MDSC to instantiate this VN using VN and TE-Topology
   Models.

3.2.  Type 2 VN Illustration

   For some VN members, the customer may want to "configure" explicit
   routes over the path that connects its two end-points.  Let us
   consider the following example.



      VN-Member 1  L1-L4 (via S3, S4, and S5)

      VN-Member 2  L1-L7 (via S3, S4, S7 and S8)

      VN-Member 3  L2-L7 (via S9, S10, and S11)

      VN-Member 4  L3-L8 (via S9, S10 and S11)

   Where the following topology is the underlay for Abstraction Node 1
   (AN1).

   There are two options depending on whether CNC or MDSC creates the
   single abstract node topology.

   Case 1:

   If CNC creates the single abstract node topology, the following
   diagram shows the message flow between CNC and MDSC to instantiate
   this VN using VN and TE-Topology Model.

   Section 7 provides JSON examples for both VN model and TE-topology
   Connectivity Matrix sub-model to illustrate how a VN can be created
   by the CNC making use of the VN module as well as the TE-topology
   Connectivity Matrix module.

3.2.1.  VN and AP Usage

   The customer access information may be known at the time of VN
   creation.  A shared logical AP identifier is used between the
   customer and the operator to identify the access link between
   Customer Edge (CE) and Provider Edge (PE) . This is described in
   Section 6 of [RFC8453].

   In some VN operations, the customer access may not be known at the
   initial VN creation.  The VN operation allow a creation of VN with

Internet-Draft                VN YANG Model                    July 2020


   only PE identifier as well.  The customer access information could be
   added later.

   To achieve this the 'ap' container has a leaf for 'pe' node that
   allows AP to be created with PE information.  The vn-member (and vn)
   could use APs that only have PE information initially.

4.  VN Model Usage

4.1.  Customer view of VN

   The VN-YANG model allows to define a customer view, and allows the
   customer to communicate using the VN constructs as described in the
   [RFC8454].  It also allows to group the set of edge-to-edge links
   (i.e., VN members) under a common umbrella of VN.  This allows the
   customer to instantiate and view the VN as one entity, making it
   easier for some customers to work on VN without worrying about the
   details of the provider based YANG models.

   This is similar to the benefits of having a separate YANG model for
   the customer services as described in [RFC8309], which states that
   service models do not make any assumption of how a service is
   actually engineered and delivered for a customer.

4.2.  Auto-creation of VN by MDSC

   The VN could be configured at the MDSC explicitly by the CNC using
   the VN YANG model.  In some other cases, the VN is not explicitly
   configured, but created automatically by the MDSC based on the
   customer service model and local policy, even in these case the VN
   YANG model can be used by the CNC to learn details of the underlying
   VN created to meet the requirements of customer service model.

4.3.  Innovative Services

4.3.1.  VN Compute

   VN Model supports VN compute (pre-instantiation mode) to view the
   full VN as a single entity before instantiation.  Achieving this via
   path computation or "compute only" tunnel setup does not provide the
   same functionality.

4.3.2.  Multi-sources and Multi-destinations

   In creating a virtual network, the list of sources or destinations or
   both may not be pre-determined by the customer.  For instance, for a
   given source, there may be a list of multiple-destinations to which
   the optimal destination may be chosen depending on the network



Lee, et al.             Expires January 14, 2021               [Page 12]

   resource situations.  Likewise, for a given destination, there may
   also be multiple-sources from which the optimal source may be chosen.
   In some cases, there may be a pool of multiple sources and
   destinations from which the optimal source-destination may be chosen.
   The following YANG module is shown for describing source container
   and destination container.  The following YANG tree shows how to
   model multi-sources and multi-destinations.

4.3.3.  Others

   The VN YANG model can be easily augmented to support the mapping of
   VN to the Services such as L3SM and L2SM as described in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-te-service-mapping-yang].

   The VN YANG model can be extended to support telemetry, performance
   monitoring and network autonomics as described in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-pm-telemetry-autonomics].

4.3.4.  Summary

   This section summarizes the innovative service features of the VN
   YANG.

   o  Maintenance of AP and VNAP along with VN

   o  VN construct to group of edge-to-edge links

   o  VN Compute (pre-instantiate)

   o  Multi-Source / Multi-Destination

   o  Ability to support various VN and VNS Types

      *  VN Type 1: Customer configures the VN as a set of VN Members.
         No other details need to be set by customer, making for a
         simplified operations for the customer.

      *  VN Type 2: Along with VN Members, the customer could also
         provide an abstract topology, this topology is provided by the
         Abstract TE Topology YANG Model.

7.  JSON Example

   This section provides json implementation examples as to how VN YANG
   model and TE topology model are used together to instantiate virtual
   networks.

   The example in this section includes following VN

   o  VN1 (Type 1): Which maps to the single node topology abstract1
      (node D1) and consist of VN Members 104 (L1 to L4), 107 (L1 to
      L7), 204 (L2 to L4), 308 (L3 to L8) and 108 (L1 to L8).  We also
      show how disjointness (node, link, srlg) is supported in the
      example on the global level (i.e., connectivity matrices level).

   o  VN2 (Type 2): Which maps to the single node topology abstract2
      (node D2), this topology has an underlay topology (absolute) (see
      figure in section 3.2).  This VN has a single VN member 105 (L1 to
      L5) and an underlay path (S4 and S7) has been set in the
      connectivity matrix of abstract2 topology;

   o  VN3 (Type 1): This VN has a multi-source, multi-destination
      feature enable for VN Member 104 (L1 to L4)/107 (L1 to L7) {multi-
      src} and VN Member 204 (L2 to L4)/304 (L3 to L4) {multi-dest}
      usecase.  The selected VN-member is known via the field "if-
      selected" and the corresponding connectivity-matrix-id.

   Note that the VN YANG model also include the AP and VNAP which shows
   various VN using the same AP.

8.  Security Considerations

   The configuration, state, and action data defined in this document
   are designed to be accessed via a management protocol with a secure
   transport layer, such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].
   The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer, and the
   mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH)
   [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-
   to-implement secure transport is TLS [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF users to a preconfigured
   subset of all available NETCONF protocol operations and content.

   The model presented in this document is used in the interface between
   the Customer Network Controller (CNC) and Multi-Domain Service
   Coordinator (MDSC), which is referred to as CNC-MDSC Interface (CMI).
   Therefore, many security risks such as malicious attack and rogue
   elements attempting to connect to various ACTN components.
   Furthermore, some ACTN components (e.g., MSDC) represent a single
   point of failure and threat vector and must also manage policy
   conflicts and eavesdropping of communication between different ACTN
   components.

   A number of configuration data nodes defined in this document are
   writable/deletable (i.e., "config true") These data nodes may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.

   These are the subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/
   vulnerability:

   o  access-point-list:

      *  access-point-id

      *  max-bandwidth

      *  avl-bandwidth

   o  vn-ap:

      *  vn-ap-id

      *  vn

      *  abstract-node

      *  ltp

   o  vn-list

      *  vn-id

      *  vn-topology-id

      *  abstract-node

   o  vn-member-id

      *  src

      *  src-vn-ap-id

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the following namespace URIs in the IETF XML
   registry [RFC3688]:

   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-vn
   Registrant Contact: The IESG.
   XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.
   --------------------------------------------------------------------

   This document registers the following YANG modules in the YANG Module
   Names registry [RFC6020]:



   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   name:         ietf-vn
   namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-vn
   prefix:       vn
   reference:    RFC XXXX (TDB)

Appendix A.  Performance Constraints

   At the time of creation of VN, it is natural to provide VN level
   constraints and optimization criteria.  It should be noted that this
   YANG model rely on the TE-Topology Model [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te-topo]
   by using a reference to an abstract node to achieve this.  Further,
   connectivity-matrix structure is used to assign the constraints and
   optimization criteria include delay, jitter etc.  [RFC8776] define
   some of the metric-types already and future documents are meant to
   augment it.
