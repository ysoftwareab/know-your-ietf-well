1.  Introduction

   The ITU-T recommendation H.261 [H261] specifies the encoding used by
   ITU-T compliant video-conference codecs.  Although these encoding
   were originally specified for fixed data rate ISDN circuits,
   experiments [INRIA], [MICE] have shown that they can also be used
   over packet-switched networks such as the Internet.

   The purpose of this memo is to specify the RTP payload format for
   encapsulating H.261 video streams in RTP [RFC3550].

   This document obsolete RFC 2032 and updates the "video/h261" media
   type that was registered in RFC 3555.

3.  Structure of the packet stream

3.1.  Overview of the ITU-T recommendation H.261

   The H.261 coding is organized as a hierarchy of groupings.  The video
   stream is composed of a sequence of images, or frames, which are
   themselves organized as a set of Groups of Blocks (GOB).  Note that
   H.261 "pictures" are referred as "frames" in this document.  Each GOB
   holds a set of 3 lines of 11 macro blocks (MB).  Each MB carries
   information on a group of 16x16 pixels: luminance information is
   specified for 4 blocks of 8x8 pixels, while chrominance information
   is given by two "red" and "blue" color difference components at a
   resolution of only 8x8 pixels.  These components and the codes
   representing their sampled values are as defined in the ITU-R
   Recommendation 601 [BT601].

   This grouping is used to specify information at each level of the
   hierarchy:

   - At the frame level, one specifies information such as the delay
   from the previous frame, the image format, and various indicators.

   - At the GOB level, one specifies the GOB number and the default
   quantifier that will be used for the MBs.

   - At the MB level, one specifies which blocks are present and which
   did not change, and optionally a quantifier and motion vectors.

   Blocks which have changed are encoded by computing the discrete
   cosine transform (DCT) of their coefficients, which are then
   quantized and Huffman encoded (Variable Length Codes).

   The H.261 Huffman encoding includes a special "GOB start" pattern,
   which is a word of 16 bits, 0000 0000 0000 0001.  This pattern is
   included at the beginning of each GOB header (and also at the
   beginning of each frame header) to mark the separation between two
   GOBs, and is in fact used as an indicator that the current GOB is
   terminated.  The encoding also includes a stuffing pattern, composed
   of seven zero bits followed by four bits with a value of one; that
   stuffing pattern can only be entered between the encoding of MBs, or
   just before the GOB separator.

3.2.  Considerations for packetization

   H.261 codecs designed for operation over ISDN circuits produce a bit
   stream composed of several levels of encoding specified by H.261 and
   companion recommendations.  The bits resulting from the Huffman
   encoding are arranged in 512-bit frames, containing 2 bits of

Internet-Draft          H.261 RTP payload format            January 2006


   synchronization, 492 bits of data and 18 bits of error correcting
   code.  The 512-bit frames are then interlaced with an audio stream
   and transmitted over px64 kbps circuits according to specification
   H.221 [H221].

   When transmitting over the Internet, we will directly consider the
   output of the Huffman encoding.  All the bits produced by the Huffman
   encoding stage will be included in the packet.  We will not carry the
   512-bit frames, as protection against bit errors can be obtained by
   other means.  Similarly, we will not attempt to multiplex audio and
   video signals in the same packets, as UDP and RTP provide a much more
   suitable way to achieve multiplexing.

   Directly transmitting the result of the Huffman encoding over an
   unreliable stream of UDP datagrams would, however, have poor error
   resistance characteristics.  The result of the hierarchical structure
   of H.261 bit stream is that one needs to receive the information
   present in the frame header to decode the GOBs, as well as the
   information present in the GOB header to decode the MBs.  Without
   precautions, this would mean that one has to receive all the packets
   that carry an image in order to properly decode its components.

   If each image could be carried in a single packet, this requirement
   would not create a problem.  However, a video image or even one GOB
   by itself can sometimes be too large to fit in a single packet.
   Therefore, the MB is taken as the unit of fragmentation.  Packets
   must start and end on a MB boundary, i.e. a MB cannot be split across
   multiple packets.  Multiple MBs may be carried in a single packet
   when they will fit within the maximal packet size allowed.  This
   practice is recommended to reduce the packet send rate and packet
   overhead.

   To allow each packet to be processed independently for efficient
   resynchronization in the presence of packet losses, some state
   information from the frame header and GOB header is carried with each
   packet to allow the MBs in that packet to be decoded.  This state
   information includes the GOB number in effect at the start of the
   packet, the macroblock address predictor (i.e. the last MBA encoded
   in the previous packet), the quantizer value in effect prior to the
   start of this packet (GQUANT, MQUANT or zero in case of a beginning
   of GOB) and the reference motion vector data (MVD) for computing the
   true MVDs contained within this packet.  The bit stream cannot be
   fragmented between a GOB header and MB 1 of that GOB.

   Moreover, since the compressed MB may not fill an integer number of
   octets, the data header contains two three-bit integers, SBIT and
   EBIT, to indicate the number of unused bits in the first and last
   octets of the H.261 data, respectively.

4.  Specification of the packetization scheme

4.1.  Usage of RTP

   Each RTP packet starts with a fixed RTP header as explained in
   RFC3550 [RFC3550].  The following fields of the RTP fixed header used
   for H.261 video streams are further emphasized here:

   - Payload type: The assignment of an RTP payload type for this packet
   format is outside the scope of this document, and will not be
   specified here.  It is expected that the RTP profile for a particular
   class of applications will assign a payload type for this encoding,
   or if that is not done then a payload type in the dynamic range shall
   be chosen.

   - The RTP timestamp encodes the sampling instant of the first video
   image contained in the RTP data packet.  If a video image occupies
   more than one packet, the timestamp SHALL be the same on all of those
   packets.  Packets from different video images MUST have different
   timestamp so that frames may be distinguished by the timestamp.  For
   H.261 video streams, the RTP timestamp is based on a 90kHz clock.
   This clock rate is a multiple of the natural H.261 frame rate (i.e.
   30000/1001 or approx. 29.97 Hz).  That way, for each frame time, the
   clock is just incremented by the multiple and this removes inaccuracy
   in calculating the timestamp.  Furthermore, the initial value of the
   timestamp MUST be random (unpredictable) to make known-plaintext
   attacks on encryption more difficult, see RTP [RFC3550].  Note that
   if multiple frames are encoded in a packet (e.g. when there are very
   little changes between two images), it is necessary to calculate
   display times for the frames after the first, using the timing
   information in the H.261 frame header.  This is required because the
   RTP timestamp only gives the display time of the first frame in the
   packet.

   - The marker bit of the RTP header MUST be set to one in the last
   packet of a video frame, and otherwise, MUST be zero.  Thus, it is
   not necessary to wait for a following packet (which contains the
   start code that terminates the current frame) to detect that a new
   frame should be displayed.

   The H.261 data SHALL follow the RTP header, as in:

   End bit position (EBIT): 3 bits

      course of the RTP session.

   Motion Vector flag (V): 1 bit

      Set to 0 if motion vectors are not used in this stream.  Set to 1
      if motion vectors may or may not be used in this stream.  The
      meaning of this bit should not be changed during the course of the
      session.

   GOB number (GOBN): 4 bits

      Encodes the GOB number in effect at the start of the packet.  Set
      to 0 if the packet begins with a GOB header.

   Macroblock address predictor (MBAP): 5 bits

      Encodes the macroblock address predictor (i.e. the last MBA
      encoded in the previous packet).  This predictor ranges from 0-32
      (to predict the valid MBAs 1-33), but because the bit stream
      cannot be fragmented between a GOB header and MB 1, the predictor
      at the start of the packet shall not be 0.  Therefore, the range
      is 1-32, which is biased by -1 to fit in 5 bits.  For example, if
      MBAP is 0, the value of the MBA predictor is 1.  Set to 0 if the
      packet begins with a GOB header.

   Quantizer (QUANT): 5 bits

      Quantizer value (MQUANT or GQUANT) in effect prior to the start of
      this packet.  Set to 0 if the packet begins with a GOB header.

   Horizontal motion vector data (HMVD): 5 bits

      Reference horizontal motion vector data (MVD).  Set to 0 if V flag
      is 0 or if the packet begins with a GOB header, or when the MTYPE
      of the last MB encoded in the previous packet was not MC.  HMVD is
      encoded as a 2's complement number, and `10000' corresponding to
      the value -16 is forbidden (motion vector fields range from
      +/-15).

   Vertical motion vector data (VMVD): 5 bits

      Reference vertical motion vector data (MVD).  Set to 0 if V flag
      is 0 or if the packet begins with a GOB header, or when the MTYPE
      of the last MB encoded in the previous packet was not MC.  VMVD is
      encoded as a 2's complement number, and `10000' corresponding to
      the value -16 SHALL not be used (motion vector fields range from
      +/-15).

   Note that the I and V flags are hint flags, i.e. they can be inferred
   from the bit stream.  They are included to allow decoders to make
   optimizations that would not be possible if these hints were not
   provided before bit stream was decoded.  Therefore, these bits cannot
   change for the duration of the stream.  A conformant implementation
   can always set V=1 and I=0.

   The H.261 stream SHALL be used without BCH error correction and
   without error correction framing.

4.2.  Recommendations for operation with hardware codecs

   Packetizers for hardware codecs can trivially figure out GOB
   boundaries using the GOB-start pattern included in the H.261 data.
   (Note that software encoders already know the boundaries.)  The
   cheapest packetization implementation is to packetize at the GOB
   level all the GOBs that fit in a packet.  But when a GOB is too
   large, the packetizer has to parse it to do MB fragmentation.  (Note
   that only the Huffman encoding must be parsed and that it is not
   necessary to fully decompress the stream, so this requires relatively
   little processing; example implementations can be found in some
   public H.261 codecs such as IVS [IVS] and VIC [VIC].)  It is
   recommended that MB level fragmentation be used when feasible in
   order to obtain more efficient packetization.  Using this
   fragmentation scheme reduces the output packet rate and therefore
   reduces the overhead.

   At the receiver, the data stream can be depacketized and directed to
   a hardware codec's input.  If the hardware decoder operates at a
   fixed bit rate, synchronization may be maintained by inserting the
   stuffing pattern between MBs (i.e., between packets) when the packet
   arrival rate is slower than the bit rate.

5.  Packet loss issues

   On the Internet, most packet losses are due to network congestion
   rather than transmission errors.  Using UDP, no mechanism is
   available at the sender to know if a packet has been successfully
   received.  It is up to the application, i.e. coder and decoder, to
   handle the packet loss.  Each RTP packet includes a sequence number
   field which can be used to detect packet loss.

   H.261 uses the temporal redundancy of video to perform compression.
   This differential coding (or INTER-frame coding) is sensitive to
   packet loss.  After a packet loss, parts of the image may remain
   corrupt until all corresponding MBs have been encoded in INTRA-frame
   mode (i.e. encoded independently of past frames).  There are several
   ways to mitigate packet loss:

   (1) One way is to use only INTRA-frame encoding and MB level
       conditional replenishment.  That is, only MBs that change (beyond
       some threshold) are transmitted.

   (2) Another way is to adjust the INTRA-frame encoding refreshment
       rate according to the packet loss observed by the receivers.  The
       H.261 recommendation specifies that a MB is INTRA-frame encoded
       at least every 132 times it is transmitted.  However, the INTRA-
       frame refreshment rate can be raised in order to speed the
       recovery when the measured loss rate is significant.

   (3) The fastest way to repair a corrupted image is to request an
       INTRA-frame coded image refreshment after a packet loss is
       detected.  One means to accomplish this is for the decoder to
       send to the coder a list of packets lost.  The coder can decide
       to encode every MB of every GOB of the following video frame in
       INTRA-frame mode (i.e.  Full INTRA-frame encoded), or if the
       coder can deduce from the packet sequence numbers which MBs were
       affected by the loss, it can save bandwidth by sending only those
       MBs in INTRA-frame mode.  This mode is particularly efficient in
       point-to-point connection or when the number of decoders is low.

   The H.261 specific control packets FIR and NACK as described in
   RFC2032 SHALL NOT be used to request image refreshment.  Old
   implementations are encourage to use the methods described in this
   section.  Image refreshment may be needed due to packet loss or due
   to application requirements.  An example of application requirement
   may be the change of the speaker in a voice-activated multipoint
   video switching conference.  There are two methods that can be used
   for requesting image refreshment.  The first method is by using the
   Extended RTP Profile for RTCP-based Feedback and sending RTCP generic
   control packets as described in RFC YYYY [rtcp-feedback].  The second

   optional features of the payload format.  The parameters are
   specified here as part of the MIME subtype registration for the ITU-T
   H.261 codec.  A mapping of the parameters into the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-new] is also provided
   for those applications that use SDP.  Multiple parameters SHOULD be
   expressed as a media type string, in the form of a semi-colon
   separated list of parameters.

6.1.  Media Type Registrations

   This section describes the media types and names associated with this
   payload format.  The section updates the previous registered version
   in RFC 3555 [RFC3555].  This registration uses the template defined
   in RFC 4288 [RFC4288]

6.1.1.  Registration of MIME media type video/H261

   MIME media type name: video

   MIME subtype name: H261

   Required parameters: None

   Optional parameters:

      CIF: This parameter has the format of parameter=value.  It
      describes the maximum supported frame rate for CIF resolution.
      permissible value are integer values 1 to 4 and it means that the
      maximum rate is 29.97/ specified value

      QCIF: This parameter has the format of parameter=value.  It
      describes the maximum supported frame rate for QCIF resolution.
      permissible value are integer values 1 to 4 and it means that the
      maximum rate is 29.97/ specified value

      D: specifies support for still image graphics according to H.261
      annex D.  If supported the parameter value SHALL be "1".  If not
      supported the parameter SHOULD NOT be used or SHALL have the value
      "0".

Internet-Draft          H.261 RTP payload format            January 2006


      This media type is framed and binary, see section 4.8 in [RFC4288]

   Security considerations: See Section 8

   Interoperability considerations:

      These are receiver options, current implementations will not send
      any optional parameters in their SDP.  They will ignore the
      optional parameters and will encode the H.261 stream without annex
      D.  Most decoders support at least QCIF resolutions and they are
      expected to be available almost in every H.261 based video
      application.

   Published specification: RFC yyy

   Applications which use this media type:

      Audio and video streaming and conferencing applications.

   Additional information: none

      Roni Even: roni.even@polycom.co.il

   Intended usage: COMMON

   Restrictions on usage:

      This media type depends on RTP framing, and hence is only defined
      for transfer via RTP [RFC3550].  Transport within other framing
      protocols is not defined at this time.

6.2.  SDP Parameters

   The MIME media type video/H261 string is mapped to fields in the
   Session Description Protocol (SDP) as follows:

   o  The media name in the "m=" line of SDP MUST be video.

   o  The encoding name in the "a=rtpmap" line of SDP MUST be H261 (the
      MIME subtype).

Internet-Draft          H.261 RTP payload format            January 2006


   o  The clock rate in the "a=rtpmap" line MUST be 90000.

   o  The optional parameters "CIF", "QCIF" and "D" if any, SHALL be
      included in the "a=fmtp" line of SDP.  These parameters are
      expressed as a MIME media type string, in the form of as a semi-
      colon separated list of parameters

6.2.1.  Usage with the SDP Offer Answer Model

   When offering H.261 over RTP using SDP in an Offer/Answer model
   [RFC3264] the following considerations are necessary.

   Codec options: (D) This option MUST NOT appear unless the sender of
   this SDP message is able to decode this option.  This option SHALL be
   considered as a receiver's capability even when send in a "sendonly"
   offer.

   Picture sizes and MPI:

   Supported picture sizes and their corresponding minimum picture
   interval (MPI) information for H.261 can be combined.  All picture
   sizes may be advertised to the other party, or only a subset of it.
   Using the recvonly or sendrev direction attribute a terminal SHOULD
   announce those picture sizes (with their MPIs) which it is willing to
   receive.  For example, CIF=2 means that receiver can receive a CIF
   picture and the frame rate SHALL be less then 15 frames per second.

   When the direction attribute is sendonly the parameters describe the
   capabilities of the stream that the sender can produce.

   Implementations following this specification SHALL specify at least
   one supported picture size.

   If the receiver does not specify the picture size /MPI parameter then
   it is safe to assume that it is an implementation that follows RFC
   2032.  In that case it is RECOMMENDED to assume that such a receiver
   supports reception of QCIF resolution with MPI=1.

   Parameters offered first are the most preferred picture mode to be
   received.

Internet-Draft          H.261 RTP payload format            January 2006


   An example of media representation in SDP is as follows: (CIF at 15
   frames per second, QCIF at 30 frames per second and annex D

      m=video 49170/2 RTP/AVP 3
      a=rtpmap:31 H261/90000
      a=fmtp:31 CIF=2;QCIF=1;D=1

   This means that the sender of this message can decode H.261 bit
   stream with following options and parameters: Preferred resolution is
   CIF (its MPI is 2), but if that is not possible then QCIF size is
   also supported.  Still image using annex D MAY be used.

7.  Backward Compatibility to RFC2032

   The current draft updates RFC2032.  This section will address the
   major backward compatibility issues.

7.1.  Optional H.261-specific control packets

   RFC 2032 defined two H.261-specific RTCP control packets, "Full
   INTRA-frame Request" and "Negative Acknowledgement".  Support of
   these control packets was optional.  The H.261-specific control
   packets differ from normal RTCP packets in that they are not
   transmitted to the normal RTCP destination transport address for the
   RTP session (which is often a multicast address).  Instead, these
   control packets are sent directly via unicast from the decoder to the
   encoder.  The destination port for these control packets is the same
   port that the encoder uses as a source port for transmitting RTP
   (data) packets.  Therefore, these packets may be considered "reverse"
   control packets.  This memo suggests generic methods to address the
   same requirement.  The authors of the drafts are not aware of
   products that supports these control packets.  Since these are
   optional features new implementations SHALL ignore them and they
   SHALL NOT be used by new implementations.

7.2.  New SDP optional parameters

   The draft adds new optional parameters to the H261 payload type.
   Since these are optional parameters we expect old implementation to
   ignore these parameters while new implementations that will receive
   the H261 payload type capabilities with no parameters will assume
   that it is an old implementation and will send H.261 at QCIF
   resolution and 30 frames per second.

8.  Security Considerations

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification [RFC3550], and any appropriate RTP profile (for example
   [RFC3551]).  This implies that confidentiality of the media streams
   is achieved by encryption.  SRTP [RFC3711] may be used to provide
   both encryption and integrity protection of RTP flow.  Because the
   data compression used with this payload format is applied end-to-end,
   encryption will be performed after compression so there is no
   conflict between the two operations.

   A potential denial-of-service threat exists for data encoding using
   compression techniques that have non-uniform receiver-end
   computational load.  The attacker can inject pathological datagrams
   into the stream which are complex to decode and cause the receiver to
   be overloaded.  The usage of authentication of at least the RTP
   packet is RECOMMENDED.  H.261 is vulnerable to such attacks, because
   it is possible for an attacker to generate RTP packets containing
   frames that affect the decoding process of future frames.  Therefore,
   the usage of data origin authentication and data integrity protection
   of at least the RTP packet is RECOMMENDED; for example, with SRTP.

   Note that the appropriate mechanism to ensure confidentiality and
   integrity of RTP packets and their payloads is very dependent on the
   application and on the transport and signaling protocols employed.
   Thus, although SRTP is given as an example above, other possible
   choices exist.
