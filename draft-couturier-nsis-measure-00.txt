Abstract 
    
   This document defines SQM (Signaling for QoS Measurement), an 
   architecture for QoS measurements of IP flows along their paths. The 
   goal of this architecture is to configure on demand several probes, 
   and to collect and coordinate the results in a multi domain 
   environment, in order to determine in real time the QoS experienced 
   by a flow on several nodes of its path. A new signaling is used to 
   install metering and reporting states in network nodes. A 
   coordination of works related to NSIS, PSAMP and IPFIX could achieve 
   the SQM specification.

1. Introduction 
    
   With the development and deployment of end-to-end QoS solutions for 
   IP flows and microflows, there will be a need for flow's QoS 
   measurements. Expected applications using these measurements tools 
   are usage-based accounting, QoS monitoring and troubleshooting. 
   Several IETF Working Groups currently work on measures. The IPFIX

   working group [3] aims at describing a standard way of exporting 
   traffic flow information out of IPFIX boxes, such as routers. The 
   PSAMP working group defines a set of sampling capabilities of network 
   elements, in order to report synthetic flow observations. PSAMP 
   framework [4] already proposes to use trajectory sampling to track 
   customer's flow performance.  
   Continuing these efforts, this draft proposes the Signalling for QoS  
   Measurement (SQM) architecture, which allows measurement in real time 
   of the QoS experienced by a flow all along its path, eventually 
   crossing several measurement domains. In this version, the draft 
   provides a high-level description of the key components and their 
   functions. In addition, it gives to the NSIS community an example for 
   a signalling which is not dedicated to resource reservation, and a 
   candidate for a NSIS application protocol.  
    
   In section 2, the motivation and scope of the SQM are given 
   In section 3, the SQM terminology is proposed, reusing at maximum 
   PSAMP, IPFIX and NSIS existing terminology.  
   In section 4, the SQM architecture is explained and discussed. 
   In section 5, the SQM signaling is described. 
   In section 6, the remaining work is discussed. 
    
 
    
2. Motivation and scope 
    
   Classical measurement models are commonly based on two devices 
   architectures. For example in [5], delay is evaluated with active 
   measures end-to-end. Usually, and following the same philosophy, 
   measures in a core network are also done comparing ingress and egress 
   reports. Such measurement architectures determine end to end, or edge 
   to edge performances, but are not sufficient to determine what are 
   the performances the different parts of a network did reach, or to 
   determine which parts did not provide the expected QoS in case of an 
   incorrect end-to-end QoS. Another problem of end-to-end performance 
   architectures is that it requires to be able to configure two edge 
   devices and retrieve information from them. In case the two probes 
   are not located in the same ISP, this configuration is difficult, if 
   not possible, as administration of a node, typically through SNMP, is 
   a critical operation that can not be easily outsourced. This problem 
   is illustrated in the following picture, where observation points are 
   located next to (or integrated in) the first network edge router, in 
   a transit network∆s border router and in the egress edge router of 
   the last domain:

    This document defines the SQM, an signalling based architecture for 
   QoS measurements of IP flows. The goal of this architecture is to 
   configure on demand several observations points, and to coordinate 
   the results in a multi domain environment, in order to determine in 
   real time the QoS experienced by a flow on several nodes of its path. 
   This means that a flow is observed on several places it goes through, 
   not only in its source and in its sink, or in a predefined couple of 
   probes. For example, the transmission delay of any flow can be 
   measured at several places, between the first ingress router to all 
   or several observation points until the flow sink. These measures can 
   be active or passive measures, the SQM imposing no constraint on the 
   flow to be measured.  
    
    With these kind of measures along a flow path, an end user, or a 
   monitoring application, could determine not only the end-to-end QoS, 
   but also the QoS provided on different path segments. Path segments 
   refers here to parts of the IP flow path delimited by observations 
   points. This precision given by several path segment related measures 
   brings a good analysis and troubleshooting tool for network 
   management and billing applications. Indeed based on these measures, 
   the localization of QoS misconfigurations and responsibilities is 
   possible in a multidomain environment. For instance, knowing the 
   delay between a source and several successive probes located at each

   network boundaries crossed by the flow, provides basic information to 
   determine the network where a congestion occurs. Similarly, the 
   comparison of measures of the volume of a flow in several 
   intermediary nodes can determine the packet loss ratio on the several 
   path segment. Again, in case of a congestion in a network, the 
   "fautive" path segment is located between the last observation point 
   where the volume was almost equal to the first measure in the path, 
   and the next observation point which sees far less volume. In the 
   case of a too high end-to-end packet loss, a "map" of the several 
   segments and their packet loss performances could give indications on 
   what parts of the network to re-dimension, or reconfigure. 
    
   The main objectives of this document are then to:    
     * describe the key architectural components of this SQM 
   architecture, 
     * define the architectural requirements, e.g., filtering and 
   sampling capacities in network elements, the security and measurement 
   domain's interconnection issues  
     * provide an overview of the signaling as a NSIS signaling upper 
   layer, also known as a Network Service Layer Protocol (NSTL) 
     * list future actions to be taken in order to achieve the 
   standardization of the SQM. 
    
    
3. Terminology 
    
   * Collector:   
   [similar to the draft-ietf-ipfix-architecture-02.txt definition] 
   The collector receives flow records from one or more exporters. 
    
   *  Control Information, Data Stream:  
   [similar to the draft-ietf-ipfix-architecture-02.txt definition] 
   The information that needs to be exported from the IPFIX device can 
   be classified into the following categories: 
    
    * Control Information :  This includes the flow type definition, 
   selection criteria  for packets within the flow send by the export 
   process and  any IPFIX protocol messages (eg. Keepalives). This 
   stream  carries all the information for the end-points to understand 
   the IPFIX protocol and specifically for the receiver to understand 
   and interpret the data send by the sender. 
    
    * Device:  A device hosting at least an observation point, a 
   metering  process and a export process. Typically, corresponding  
   observation point(s), metering process(es), and exporter  process(es) 
   are co-located at this device, for example, at a router. 
    
    * Export Process:   
   [similar to the draft-ietf-ipfix-architecture-02.txt definition]

   The process of sending flow records to one or more collectors. 
    
    * Filtering   
   [identical to draft-ietf-psamp-sample-tech-00.txt]  
   Filtering selects a subset of packets by applying deterministic 
   functions on parts of the packet content like header fields or parts 
   of the payload. Filtering techniques can also be used to emulate a 
   (pseudo)random selection of packets with a given probability p. A 
   filtering process needs to process the packet  (look at packet header 
   and/or payload) in order to make the selection decision. 
    
    * Flow Record: 
   [similar to the draft-ietf-ipfix-architecture-02.txt definition]   
   A flow record contains information about a specific flow that was  
   metered at an observation point. A flow record contains measured  
   properties of the flow (e.g. the total number of bytes of all  
   packets of the flow) and usually characteristic properties of the  
   flow (e.g. source IP address). 
    
    * Sampling/identification hash functions:   
   A formal descriptions of sampling and identification hash functions 
   are presented in [6]. A hash function is a function which associates 
   to a packet, and more precisely its invariant packet content (part of 
   the packet header, and its payload), a fixed length bit stream. The 
   sampling hash function is a hashing function used to select packet on 
   the value of the hashing. The identification hash function uses the 
   hashing function result as a packet identifier. 
    
    * Metering Process:     
   [similar to the draft-ietf-ipfix-architecture-02.txt definition] 
   The metering process generates flow records. Input to the process are 
   IP packets observed in an observation point. The metering process 
   consists of a set of functions that includes packet header capturing, 
   timestamping, sampling, classifying, and maintaining flow records. 
    
    * Observation Domain:  The set of observation points which is the 
   largest aggregatable  set of flow information at the IPFIX Device is 
   termed as an  observation domain. The observation domain presents 
   itself a  unique ID to the collector for identifying the export 
   packets  generated by it. One or more Observation Domains can 
   interface  with the same export process. Example: The observation 
   domain  could be a router line-card, composed of several interfaces 
   with  each interface being an observation point. 
    
    * Observation Point:   
   [inspired from draft-ietf-ipfix-architecture-02.txt and draft-ietf-
   psamp-framework-01.txt 's definition]  
   The observation point is a location in the network where IP  packets 
   can be observed. Examples are, a line to which a probe is attached, a

   shared medium, such as an Ethernet-based LAN, a  single port of a 
   router, or a set of interfaces (physical or logical) of a router. An 
   observation point could also be a port mirroring destination like a 
   regular traffic analyzer. 
   An observation point would be called active when it has installed 
   metering and reporting states for a particular flow.  
    
    * Path Segment:   The segment of a path delimited by two observation 
   points.  
    
     * Reporting Process:    
    [ draft-ietf-psamp-framework-01.txt definition]   
    The creation of a report stream of information on packets   
    selected by a selection process, in preparation for export. The  
    input to a reporting process comprises that information available  
    to a selection process, for the selected packets. The report stream 
    contains two distinguished types of information: packet reports, 
    and report interpretation. 
    
    * Selection Process:    
   [draft-ietf-psamp-framework-01.txt definition]  
   A selection process selects packets for reporting at an   observation 
   point. The inputs to the selection process are   the packets observed 
   at the observation point (including packet   encapsulation headers), 
   information derived from the packets' treatment at the observation 
   point, and selection state that may be maintained by the observation 
   point. Selection is   accomplished through operating on these inputs 
   with one or more selection operations. 
    
    * Selection State: the observation point may maintain state 
   information for use by the reporting process, and/or by multiple 
   selection operations, either on the same packet, or on different 
   packets. Examples include counters, timestamps, iterators for 
   pseudorandom number generators, calculated hash values, and 
   indicators of whether a packet was selected by a given selection 
   operation. 
         [draft-ietf-psamp-framework-01.txt  definition] 
    
    * SQM Initiator:   SQM entity that initiates SQM signaling for a 
   flow measurement. It can be located in the end system, but may reside 
   elsewhere in  the flow path.     
    
    * Template:  Template is an ordered n-tuple (eg. <type,length>, 
   TLV), used to  completely identify the structure and semantics of a 
   particular  information that needs to be communicated from the IPFIX 
   Device  to the collector. Each template is uniquely identifiable by 
   some  means (eg. by using a Template ID).

   The definitions in this section are intended be identical or inspired 
   with that in the IPFIX and PSAMP frameworks. 
    
    
    
4. The SQM architecture 
    
4.1 Observation point's density 
    
      The goal of the SQM architecture is to initiate and retrieve 
   measurements of a flow on several observation points, in order to 
   have a precise understanding of the QoS the flow receives. A network 
   which implements the SQM capabilities must contain probes 
   disseminated in the network with a certain density, in order to allow 
   measures to be done for any flow in this network. A first level of 
   density would be an observation point on every access router, in 
   order to measure the end-to-end QoS of end user flows. An higher 
   density defined by one observation point on every ingress or egress 
   link of a domain allows to measure the performance of this particular 
   domain. If this observation point density is adopted in a set of 
   peering networks, or even a lighter density such as one observation 
   on every ingress link, the SQM allows flow measures to be made edge-
   to-edge for each network crossed by the flow. 
   In order to get a set of more fine tuned measures of a flow in one 
   network, other observation points would be also located inside the 
   network, thus making possible a path segment decomposition of the 
   network. 
    
 
4.2 One way signaling  
 
   Because measurement requires a certain amount of computing in probes 
   and in analysis applications, only the flows whose QoS monitoring is 
   needed will be measured, and only the observation points located on 
   the paths of the flows will make the requested measures.  
   Then a protocol is needed to specify which flows must be measured: 
   the emitter of a flow, or an application monitoring the flow will 
   emit a QoS measurement request to the network(s). In classical two-
   devices configuration, this protocol is often SNMP or CLI between the 
   collector and the devices. Here, the devices are spread in the 
   network(s), they must be found on the fly for each flow, and the 
   protocol to configure them is used in interdomain configuration.  
   In order to determine the available devices on the flow path, and 
   install in these devices in real time metering and reporting 
   processes, on-path signalling is a natural choice. Signalling follows 
   the IP flow and is dedicated to install states, usually resource 
   reservation states, in the network elements the flow goes through. In 
   SQM, the signaling is used to install the configurations of the 
   devices for the metering and reporting processes, that is why it is 
 
 
Couturier              Expires - November 2003               [Page 8] 
Internet Draft   draft-couturier-nsis-measure-00.txt         May 2003 
 
 
   said the SQM signaling installs metering and reporting states in 
   devices.  
   In this document, the emitter of the signalling for QoS measurement 
   request is called the signalling initiator.  
    
   On-path signalling, like RSVP, can be transported by IP networks 
   which does not implement it. That is an advantage for gradual 
   deployment of a signaling based solution, and also because the 
   deployment of probes in the network is necessarily limited: precise 
   measures do not require that each nodes (especially routers) make 
   measures. However, the question about measure accuracy is to be 
   studied with regard to the observation point∆s density. In the RSVP 
   model, an over-provisioned network surrounded by RSVP network may 
   provide acceptable QoS, thus preserving the RSVP service, even is the 
   routers are not RSVP capable. Concerning SQM, a signalling unaware 
   node, or network, does not weaken at all the integrity of the 
   signalled service, which is measurement, but it simply reduces the 
   global observation point density, and may reduce locally the accuracy 
   of congestion localization.   
    
   The results of the local measurements would not be sent back to the 
   signalling initiator using signalling, for three reasons:  
      o first, the application requesting the measures is not 
   necessarily the flow emitter or signaling initiator, and can even be 
   off-path, as a classical QoS monitoring application, 
      o second, if each device sends back reports to the signalling 
   initiator the amount of measures could be important in size, and then 
   overflowing the signalling initiator, 
      o third, for confidentiality and integrity of the measures, the 
   measures performed at the exit of one network should not be sent back 
   to this network, which would gives the opportunity to this network to 
   corrupt the measures for its benefit. Furthermore, not knowing the 
   measures made downstream or upstream, and even not knowing if 
   measures are performed, a network has little opportunity to send 
   forged measures, as it may be discovered by comparing with the 
   neighbour measures.  
    
   Consequently, the same type of collector than in IPFIX and PSAMP is 
   required to get the results of the measures. One first effect on the 
   signalling is that a response to a SQM request is not needed in 
   normal cases: the signalling is one way, because no backward message 
   is needed for reporting results.  
   The second consequence is that the signalling must carry the 
   information about where and how to send the reports. An address (URL, 
   or IP address and port number) designating the collector is inserted 
   in the SQM request and will be part of active device's reporting 
   states.

4.3 SQM measurement state management 
    
   The installation of metering and reporting processes and associated 
   states is proposed to follow the soft state model, for the same 
   reasons than RSVP: the states are removed if they are not regularly 
   refreshed, which copes gracefully with routing updates and end 
   point/signaling initiator's silent crashes. 
    
   However, the SQM state management is enriched with specific metering 
   and reporting state installation procedures: it is proposed that the 
   devices, routers or probes, can decide to accept or not to perform 
   the requested measures.  
    

4.3.1 Sate installation alternatives
    
   A SQM device has the possibility to intercept a measurement request, 
   and, based on a local procedure, decide not to install the 
   measurement state. In case the probe is inside a mediation device, or 
   inside a router, the request is of course forwarded downstream, as a 
   normal packet would be. 
 
   The reasons why a SQM device would accept for a particular request to 
   install or nor measurement states are the following: 
 
     o systematic state installation is not always needed. It is indeed 
   expected that in certain configurations, SQM capable routers or 
   probes are often and regularly spread in the network, in order to 
   allow a large thus accurate set of measures. This high observation 
   point density allows a very close monitoring of flows that are seen 
   as critical. However, for other flows, this accuracy would not be 
   needed. For example, if the QoS measured in a device close to the 
   flow sink is good, intermediates measures are not so useful as no 
   problem is to be investigated. But if later, this flow does not 
   receive a good QoS anymore, the signalling initiator would like to 
   get measurement's reports from more devices, or even from all SQM 
   capable devices along the flow path. Such heavy measures would indeed 
   reduce the size of the path segments, and consequently would localize 
   more precisely the origin of problem. 
    
     o load balancing of measures. Devices located in large links, 
   typically at peering points between ISPs, may receive a large amount 
   of requests. As in RSVP, SQM scales linearly in function of the 
   number of (accepted) requests, which may be problematic. A solution 
   can be to distribute the measures between a group of probes that 
   observe the same link, a measure being always selected by one unique 
   probe of the group. For instance, a probe would silently refuse to

   install all measures for flows with even port number, but would 
   accept the ones with odd port number. 
    
     o CPU and memory shortage. While load balancing solve the 
   feasibility of a large number of measure, it does not decrease the 
   amount of memory and CPU needed for a measure, and does not always 
   prevent a CPU or memory shortage.  
   In Intserv networks, a shortage of resource in a specific node simply 
   precludes the whole chain of RSVP routers to establish the resource 
   reservation. On the contrary, measurement does not require an 
   unbroken chain of active measurement points, a shortage of 
   measurement resource in a specific device should not prevent the 
   other device to make a measure. Of course, a device declining the 
   measure lower the accuracy of the measure, by refusing to divide in 
   two path segments one path segment. Anyway, a device reaching its 
   maximum measurement capacity can decline silently to install 
   measurement state, which means acts as a non capable SQM node for 
   this request.    
    

4.3.2 State installation algorithms   
   As seen in the previous chapter, the behavior of a SQM capable device 
   is not to accept unconditionally the measurement requests and to 
   install the metering and reporting processes/states. A SQM device may 
   even accept a certain fraction of the metering and reporting states 
   installation from the SQM requests.  
    
    
   Locally to a probe, there are several algorithms that can be 
   implemented in order to accept or not a measure. For instance, in a 
   case of load balancing where a group of devices observes the same 
   link, one device can select measures which are related to flow having 
   destination IP addresses of a certain type, e.g. whose bit∆s sum is 
   odd or even. A local default metering and reporting states 
   installation acceptance ratio may also be set by configuration in a 
   device, in order to accept randomly a certain portion of the 
   requests. It is then expected that this installation acceptance ratio 
   is maximum in probes located at the edge of the network, as this 
   edge∆s probes are crucial to determine the end-to-end QoS, and can 
   support a load whose amount is more controlled. 
   More complex local acceptance algorithm may be possible, but are not 
   described in this document. 
    
    
   SQM must also support a user-defined state installation policy. Here 
   user-defined means the SQM initiator can influence the state 
   installation in the probes. This corresponds to the case where the 
   end-to-end QoS is either acceptable, and does not require a heavy

   monitoring, or bad, and thus requires a higher number of active 
   observation points, in order to accurately make a diagnostic, and 
   define responsibilities. To do so, the signalling request carries a 
   dynamic state installation acceptance factor, that can increase or 
   decrease the chance of the metering and reporting state∆s 
   installation. The higher the state installation acceptance factor is, 
   the higher the probability is for every probe to make the requested 
   measure.  
   This factor can be compared to a priority parameter in classical 
   signaling, and can evolve during the flow lifetime. Indeed, a flow 
   can be first monitored with a low dynamic state installation factor, 
   and after a while subsequent SQM requests can have a higher factor 
   value. Typically, in this case, only the two devices next to the sink 
   and source would be active. Then, if the end-to-end QoS is bad, SQM 
   requests with higher state installation factor value would make 
   devices on the flow path active. Associated with the local default 
   states installation acceptance ratio mechanism, this priority 
   mechanism allows the selection of the critical flows inside the 
   loaded devices, in order to make loaded probes measure the really 
   important flows.  
 
    
 
4.4 SQM reports and SQM Collectors  
    
   Because SQM is targeted to get QoS measures in real time, the report 
   to sent to collectors must be emitted quite frequently. The order of 
   the report time interval is expected to be around a couple of 
   seconds. Too frequent reports would generate a heavy traffic between 
   devices and collectors, but having a too long report period would be 
   prejudicial as QoS failures would be detected too late, compared to 
   the end user experience.  
   So the value of report frequency is a critical, and the question 
   whether this frequency is fixed and set by configuration, or dynamic 
   and advertised in the signalling request is still open. 
    
   The signalling request must specify where to send the reports, as 
   there can be several instance of collectors for a network, and the 
   place of the collector is not fixed: it could be in the flow emitter, 
   or in a specific network QoS monitoring application.  
    
   The basic architecture of the SQM is illustrated below, where one 
   collector receives the reports for one flow from the devices where 
   measurement points are active.

   The signalling should then contain a URL, or IP address/port number, 
   where to send the reports. A public key carried in the signalling 
   request could be also used to encrypt flow records, and then provide 
   integrity and privacy of the measures. 
    
   In case of a multidomain architecture, the links between the 
   collector and the different measurement domains should be secure, as 
   they cross other domains. Especially, because the identity of the 
   collector is advertised by signalling on different domains it could 
   become a target for attacks, such as DoS, or forged measurement 
   reports. On the other hand, networks which report measures may want 
   to protect themselves by hiding their different devices/routers and 
   consequently prefer to have a limited set of communication channels 
   with external collectors. That is why a first stage of proxy 
   collectors is proposed, as illustrated in the next figure.

   The proxy collector inside domain C is a proxy for its domain. It 
   collects the several reports, and forward a bundle report to the real 
   collector. A proxy collector could just forward flow records to the 
   collector, or already re-associate several measures concerning the 
   same packet together, in order to report aggregated flow records. 
   This architecture based on proxy collectors allows the measurement 
   reports flow from domain C toward the collector to be manageable and 
   secured, as it is a unique pre-defined communication between only two 
   servers.  
   In this case, the devices in domain C must transmit to their proxy 
   collector the information that the flow records must be forwarded to 
   the real collector. As a matter of fact, the reports exported by the 
   device must contain the collector's address that was in the SQM 
   signaling request. 
    
 
5. Measurement methods of SQM 
    
   This chapter explains two examples of measures in the SQM 
   architecture, in order to derive requirements on the signalling and 
   the SQM devices. The first example is a solution to make passive 
   measure of delay, the second is a solution to measure packet loss. 
   Other measurement methods are also possible, and should be identified 
   in order to make sure the signalling would offer the full 
   capabilities and flexibility to support them. 
    
5.1 Passive delay measure in SQM 
    
   To measure the delay of a flow in the SQM, the idea is to report the 
   arrival time at each active observation points of particular packets 
   of the flow. A selection of packets to be observed must be done to 
   limit the number of records to analyze. These selected packets must 
   be ideally chosen, or sampled, not too frequently, but regularly 
   inside this flow. Of course, the different devices must have 
   synchronized clocks, e.g. based on the Global Positioning System. 
   The difficulty with passive measures is that exactly the same packet 
   must be chosen/sampled, and identified at every active observation 
   point. The observation points and collectors must absolutely not 
   mistake one of the sampled packets with others sampled packets, or 
   with other packets of the flow. Otherwise, the measure would be 
   incoherent in the best case, or erroneous in the worst case. To 
   sample and unambiguously identify one packet out of the flow in each 
   active devices, a sampling based on a double hash functions would be 
   performed.  
   The first sampling uses a deterministic function of the invariant 
   packet content (packet payload and fields which are not changed by 
   routers), in order to select a fraction of the flow packet. Because 
   this function is deterministic and is activated in all active 
   observation points, a packet which is selected by this sampling is 
 
 
Couturier              Expires - November 2003              [Page 14] 
Internet Draft   draft-couturier-nsis-measure-00.txt         May 2003 
 
 
   then selected in every other active observation points. This 
   deterministic function and the results of this function to be matched 
   must be chosen with care for two reasons: 
     o in order to have a reasonable packet selection ratio, 
     o the packets of the flow have already the same IP addresses and 
   ports numbers, so a more in-depth hashing function is required. 
      
   Once selected by the first deterministic sampling, the packet is then 
   time stamped, and must be identified unambiguously, in order to be 
   distinguishable from other sampled packets. The collector which will 
   receives this packet's report must indeed correlate this report only 
   with reports of the same packet generated by other devices. That's 
   why a second identification hash function will generate a packet 
   identifier to be inserted with the timestamp in the report. This 
   identifier must be unique during a relatively long period of the 
   flow's measurement, in order to avoid duplicated packet 
   identifications. It must of course be the same identification hash 
   functions installed in all active observation points.     
    
   To summarize the different actions implemented in the SQM device, the 
   following diagram explains them: 
    
    
      
      +-------+ pack- +--------+   +--------+   +--------+   +-------+ 
      |filter-| ets   |sampling|   |time-   |   |identi- |   |export-| 
      |ing    +------>| process+-->|stamping+-->|fication|-->|ing    | 
      |5-tuple|       | (hash) |   |        |   | (hash) |   |process| 
      +-------+       +--------+   +--------+   +--------+   +-------+ 
    
    
    
   Concerning timestamping, this operation could be performed after the 
   two hash functions, instead of in between, the difference not being 
   important. 
   The collector receives then several reports and can calculate the 
   delay of the packet to reach every observation point. The successive 
   measures can then give an average delay for each active observation 
   points. 
                                  
   The signalling request must then carry:  
     o the flow filter 
     o the first sampling function (which is a hash function of the 
   invariant packet content). Indeed, the sampling must be chosen 
   knowing what must be the sampling probability and the flow rate, and 
   the "entropy" of the fields of the flow's packets.   
     o the indication that time must be stamped 
     o the second (identification) hash function, as it must be the same 
   function used in all devices to identify unambiguously the packets

5.2 Packet loss in SQM 
    
   This measures is based on the notification of sampled and 
   unambiguously identified packets such as explained above. The 
   difference is that instead of a time stamp, the report contains the 
   number of the packet given by a counter. 
   The configuration of the device is the following: 
    
    
      +-------+ pack- +-------+   +--------+   +--------+   +-------+ 
      |filter-| ets   |       |   |sampling|   |identi- |   |export-| 
      |ing    +------>|counter+-->|process +-->|fication|-->|ing    | 
      |5-tuple|       |       |   | (hash) |   | (hash) |   |process| 
      +-------+       +-------+   +--------+   +--------+   +-------+ 
    
    
   Of course, packet reordering may introduce a certain imprecision in 
   reports, as a packet can be counted as lost or added when it has only 
   been inverted in the flow with the sampled packet. Anyway, the 
   collector should determine after several reports, a good estimation 
   of the packet loss ratio, as this imprecision stays at the same order 
   of few packets, while the amount of counted packet increases. 
       
    
   The signalling request must then carry:  
     o the flow filter 
     o an activation of the packet counter 
     o the first sampling function (which is a hash function of the 
   invariant packet content). Indeed, the sampling must be chosen 
   knowing what must be the sampling probability and the flow rate, and 
   the "entropy" of the fields of the flow's packets.   
     o the second (identification) hash function, as it must be the same 
   function used in all devices to identify unambiguously the packets 
      
 
   We can naturally derive the metering states that must be installed by 
   a SQM initiator which requests a delay and packet loss of a flow:

   |      |   |       |   | (hash) |   |ing   |   |process |   |       |

5.3 Other measures 
   The delay and packet loss measures are examples to deduce 
   capabilities the signaling and observation points must support. Other 
   example may be also presented in future versions, especially if they 
   requires new signaling capabilities. 
   Some measures for collecting aggregate informations or router 
   information may be also possible, but are to for further studies.   
    
 
6. Formal Syntax for the SQM signaling 
    
    
   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur 
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC-2234 [7]. 
    
   <RequestMeasure Message>  = <MeasureID> 
                               <acceptance_factor> 
                               <FLOW_FILTER>  
                               <METERING_ACTIONS> 
                               <COLLECTOR> 
    
   <TearMeasure Message>  = <MeasureID> 
    
    
   <METERING_ACTIONS>        = 1*<METERING_ACTION> <EXPORTING> 
    
   <METERING_ACTION>         = <COUNTER> / <SAMPLING> / <IDENTIFICATION>  
    
   <COLLECTOR>               = <Collector_address> 
                               [ < report_frequency > ] 
                               [ < Security_data > ] 
 
 
    
   <SAMPLING>  <IDENTIFICATION> are tbd. 
 
    
    
 
7. Remaining Work 
    
   The sampling/identification hash function to be activated in devices 
   by SQM signalling must be defined, and formulated in the signalling 
   description. This work could be common to PSAMP and NSIS. 
    
   IPFIX WG aims at designing the reporting protocol between IPFIX 
   device and collectors, thus the protocol defined by IPFIX will be a 
   reference if not the protocol between SQM device and collectors. The 
   identified new requirement that SQM brings to IPFIX protocol is to 
 
 
Couturier              Expires - November 2003              [Page 17] 
Internet Draft   draft-couturier-nsis-measure-00.txt         May 2003 
 
 
   allow to carry the information about the final collector. Indeed, the 
   SQM proxy collector must receive information from the device to know 
   which collector to re-emit reports to, and how. This information 
   gathers the MeasureID, and COLLECTOR fields from the signalling. 
    
   NSIS is the work group which deals with signalling in IETF. The SQM 
   signalling is a candidate for a new NSIS signalling layer 
   application. 
    
 
8. Security issues 
    
   SQM identifies three interfaces: the signalling, the device to 
   collector interface (the collector may be a intermediary collector), 
   and the intermediary collector to collector interface. The two 
   latter's should preferably be realized by the same protocol.  
   The security considerations of IPFIX should apply to the SQM 
   collectors interfaces. 
   The NSIS security considerations of NSIS applies to the SQM 
   signalling.   
   [more to come] 
    
8.1 Confidence in reports 
   The question about the validity of a report received by a collector 
   must be addressed, as a report can be used to identify 
   responsibilities of a carrier. Indeed, in case of delay measurement, 
   a report sent by an ingress router of a domain would indicate the 
   level of service the upstream network provides: good, or slow, 
   depending on the arrival time of the packets in the ingress router. 
   By giving a false arrival time, later than the real one, a device 
   might indicate the upstream network as responsible for its own delay. 
   This might also happen if a clock is not well synchronized.  
   To prevents erroneous interpretations of incorrect reports, the 
   solution is to get several measures from active observation points. 
   Having several measures, time stampings can be compared and checked 
   each others. For instance, a SQM capable egress router would report 
   measures that can be compared with the same measures performed in the 
   next router which is the ingress router of the downstream domain. 
   Incoherences between these two measures are easy to detect.
