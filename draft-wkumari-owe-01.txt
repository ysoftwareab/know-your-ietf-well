1.  tl;dr / Executive summary

   This (colloquial) summary will be removed before publication:

   Currently, there are many open/unencrypted public WiFi networks,
   designed for "ease of use" in places such as coffee shops, libraries,
   etc.  When a user connects to these open networks, they are using an
   unencrypted connection and their traffic can be easily viewed and/or
   intercepted by any other user within wireless range, simply by using
   a network sniffing tool such as Wireshark.

   While users *should* use a VPN, many do not.  Places that provide
   public WiFi access *should* only provide an encrypted SSID, and print
   the passphrase on the wall or receipts (or similar); but, well, they
   are a coffee shop, and want to provide easy access to everyone who
   buys an espresso...

Internet-Draft              draft-wkumari-owe                August 2015


   This document defines a new, opportunistically encrypted mode for
   WiFi networks.  The SSID will still appear to be open (there will not
   be a "lock" icon when scanning), but will actually be encrypted,
   using the SSID as the passphrase.  Software running on the client
   will detect that this is an opportunistically encrypted connection
   and will automagically provide the SSID as the passphrase, providing
   an encrypted connection without any interaction from the user.  This
   system leverages existing WiFi protocols and WPA2, the only change is
   in operational practices and the client UI.

1.1.  FAQ / Common questions / Notes

   Q1: If everyone uses the SSID as the key, can't attackers just use
   this to decrypt all the data?
   A: WPA2 using PSK generates a unique Pairwise Transient Key (PTK)
   between the AP and each client.  This PTK is derived using something
   called the 4-Way Handshake ( see IEEE 802.11-2012 (or the summary at
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11i-2004#The_four-
   way_handshake )), which includes nonces from both the client and the
   AP.  Unfortunately, this doesn't use a public key exchange protocol,
   and so an attacker who can watch the initial client association can
   derive the user's encryption key.  This is a weakness in WPA2-PSK,
   and not specific to OWE.

   Q2: So does this actually help?
   A: Yes. This provides protection if the passive attacker wasn't
   already present when the user connected, or if the passive attacker
   was not able to hear both sides of the connection.  OWE does not
   provide very strong protection, and does not claim to.  It does,
   however, raise the bar for the attacker, or force him to become
   active (and force users to disassociate (so he can watch the 4 way
   handshake)).  OWE specifically does NOT provide the "lock" icon (or
   any other obvious feedback) when users scan for open wireless
   networks, because we do not want users to assume that they are
   getting "real" encryption.  OWE will become more secure if and when
   WiFi with a public key exchange (such as Diffie-Hellman) is deployed.
   The incremental cost to implement OWE is very small (it involves
   adding a flag to beacons, and clients to know to not display the lock
   icon) and so we feel that the benefit outweighs the cost.

   Q3: Isn't this vulnerable to the fake AP attack?!
   A: Yes. An attacker can stand up their own AP with the same SSID and
   passphrase.  This is true for any network that uses WPA2-PSK when the
   attacker knows the passphrase (for example, if the coffee shop prints
   the passphrase on the wall, receipts, etc) and it not specific to
   OWE.  OWE is not designed to defeat active attackers, nor solve all
   issues.  See Q2.

   Q4: This isn't really opportunistic encryption...
   A: Perhaps not, but it is has many of the same properties - it is
   unauthenticated, is mainly designed to deal with passive listeners,
   doesn't require interaction from the user, etc.  I also wanted to
   have a cool acronym - actually I wanted it to be OWL, but was not
   able to reverse engineer a non-contrived name that made that...

   Q5: Doesn't this belong in [ IEEE | WiFi Alliance | <insert other SDO
   here> ] ?
   A: Answer unclear, ask again later.  I have discussed this with a
   number of people who participate in other SDOs, and it seems like the
   IETF is the best home for it, at least for now.  It does not require
   changes to any underlying transport, it does not change any
   standards, it simply takes advantage of work done in other standards
   bodies.

2.  Introduction / Background

   As of the time of this writing, it is very common for users to
   connect to so called "open" wireless networks, for example in coffee
   shops, hotels, airports and similar.  These networks provide no
   encryption, which means that the user's traffic is visible to anyone
   nearby with packet capture software, for example, Wireshark.  It is
   also trivial for an attacker to perform a Man-in-the-Middle attacks
   as they can see all of the user's traffic.

   There are a number of solutions to this problem, such as WPA2 (Wi-Fi
   Protected Access II), but these require either obtaining a passphrase
   from the network operator (WPA-Personal / Pre-Shared Key (PSK) mode)
   or having valid credentials for the network (WPA-Enterprise /
   [IEEE.802-11i]WPA-802.1X).

   While these provide good security, for convenience reasons network
   operators often deploy open / unencrypted networks for public or
   "guest" use.  This allows the public or visitors to get Internet
   access without having to ask for a passphrase, look around for one
   printed on a receipt or similar.  Instead of chastising network
   operators for providing insecure access, this document provides a
   method to implement unauthenticated, encrypted network access.

   This is not intended to replace other existing and more robust
   methods of authentication that provide encrypted access to a WiFi
   network once the user is authenticated and authorized to join the
   network, e.g.  WPA-Enterprise / IEEE 802.1x or Hotspot 2.0.  Rather,
   this is intended for low-end, unmanaged guest access networks such as
   SOHO networks that would otherwise either be left unencrypted, or
   whose password would be shared via other means such as posting it on
   the wall of the coffee shop.

2.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  OWE protected networks

   In order to provide an encrypted connection using OWE, the network
   operator creates an SSID with the (WPA2 / 802.11i [IEEE.802-11i])
   pre-shared key identical to the SSID.  As part of the WPA2 protocol
   the wireless client (STAtion) and Access Point (AP) derive a Pairwise
   Transient Key (PTK), which provides an encrypted "channel" between
   the client and AP.

3.1.  OWE Support Advertisement in Beacons

   In order to advertise that this network supports OWE the Access Point
   will include the OWE Vendor-specific Information Element in Wireless
   Beacon frames.

      - 64-6A-74 (AUTH-SERVERS). [ If approved, this may move under the
      IANA OUI if desired]

   An Access Point that includes the OWE Vendor-specific Information
   Element in beacon frames is signalling that is supports OWE on that
   particular SSID, and that they PSK is the same as the SSID.  Client
   (STAtions) connecting to OWE enabled networks MUST use the SSID as
   the PSK, and MUST NOT display a "lock" icon in the list of SSIDs when
   scanning.  User Interfaces MAY provide some feedback that this is an
   OWE protected network, but this should not be too prominent to avoid
   users assuming that they are getting more security than they actually
   are.

3.2.  OWE Advertisement in Access Network Query Protocol (ANQP)

   This section to be fleshed out later, but the same general principle
   applies.

   SUpport for OWE can also be advertised in IEEE 802.11u-2011 using a
   virtual roaming consortium with the same OUI.  Examples will be
   provided soon.

4.  Deployment

   Because one of the largest problems with most low-end WiFi devices is
   their ability to receive timely updates to patch security holes and
   add new features post sale, it may be appropriate to define a
   lightweight version of this opportunistic encryption such that one or
   both sides of the wireless network connection can take advantage of
   this improved privacy via opportunistic encryption despite not being
   updated to formally support OWE beacons.  This model simply defines
   an agreed-upon or best practice method for manually configuring both
   network and client devices to attempt connecting to open, but secured
   WiFi networks when the password is not published, but the presence of
   a password is intended to provide link encryption rather than access
   control.

   As with the full mode defined above, the access point is configured
   to accept a WPA2-PSK that is identical to the SSID.  However, instead
   of advertising the OWE capability in beacons, the network looks like
   a standard encrypted network to host devices that wish to connect to
   it.  Host devices that are not OWE aware can be configured by the
   user to connect in the standard process, by selecting the desired
   SSID and manually entering a password that just happens to be the
   same as the SSID.  Host devices that are OWE-aware can automatically
   try the SSID as a password when the user selects that network to
   attempt to connect to it, and only present the user with a password
   prompt if that authentication fails, even if there is no OWE beacon
   seen from the AP.  If the device is able to connect to the network
   automatically via the SSID password, it can infer that this is an OWE
   network and present the appropriate notifications to the user.

4.1.  Advertising OWE support on legacy devices

   OWE is designed for use on consumer / commodity Customer Premises
   Equipment (CPE).  The software running on these devices are often not
   upgrades for many years, and so adding the OWE Vendor Specific
   Information Element into the beacon may not be feasible.  In order to
   allow users of these devices to still be able to advertise OWE
   support we define an interim measure.

   A user who wishes to advertise that their network / SSID supports OWE
   should add the string '_owe' to the SSID name and set the passphrase
   the same as the SSID.  Clients connecting to this SSID SHOULD try the
   full SSID name (including the _owe suffix) and SHOULD NOT display the
   lock icon.  Users who have legacy clients can manually see that the
   SSID ends in _owe and manually configure the passphrase as the SSID.

5.  Implementation notes

   [ Ed note: This section contains rough notes for people who want to
   experiment with OWE.  It will be tidied / removed before
   publication.]

   There is some (very rough) example code in the Github repository, and
   also some example beacon captures, in pcapng format (view with
   Wireshark / tcpdump)

   The easiest way to quickly test this (IMO) is to install the hostapd
   tools on something like a Raspberry Pi, and then add

   <CODE BEGINS>
    #OWE:
    vendor_elements=dd05646a740100
   <CODE ENDS>

   to /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf.

   Another easy option is to use an AP running OpenWRT[OpenWrt].  My
   testing setup for this is a Ubiquiti Unifi (~$70USD on Amazon)
   running Barrier Breaker 14.07.

   After installing OpenWRT login via SSH and edit the /lib/netifd/
   hostapd.sh (this gets run when the WiFi interfaces is enabled).  Find
   the section around 'append bss_conf' and add:

Internet-Draft              draft-wkumari-owe                August 2015


<CODE BEGINS>
 #This adds the OWE 802.11 Vendor Specific Information Element to the beacon frames.
 append bss_conf "# OWE: Opportunistic Wireless Encryption - draft-wkumari-owe" "$N"
 append bss_conf "vendor_elements=dd05646a740100"  "$N"
<CODE ENDS>

   Disable and reenable the Wireless interface and it should start
   including the OWE information element in all beacon frames.  You can
   look at the generated config in /tmp/run/hostapd-phy0.conf.  While it
   works, this code is far from ideal - it always includes the OWE
   Vendor Specific Information Element - eventually I'll add something
   to the GUI to enable users to toggle it on and off, but this is a
   good start for testing.  Look for additional code in the Github repo
   soon!

6.  IANA Considerations

   [ To be completed after discussions ]

   Currently the OWE Vendor-specific Information Element is using type
   1, sub-type 0 under the AUTH-SERVERS OUI.  This is to allow
   experimentation with OWE without squatting on the IANA OUI.  If OWE
   progresses within the IETF, and the IESG chooses, I'm fine to place
   this under the IANA OUI, or for it to remain under AUTH-SERVERS.
   It's all just numbers.

7.  Security Considerations

   There are many attacks that this does not protect against, including
   attackers watching the 4-Way Handshake and deriving the PTK between
   the client and the user.  This is a weakness in the wireless
   specification, and not specific to OWE.  In order to not have the
   user assume that they are getting stronger protection than they
   really are, the user interface should not provide obvious feedback
   that OWE is in use.  OWE simply raises the bar slightly; it does not
   claim to solve all wireless issues.

   This solution does not protect against so called "fake AP" attacks.
   Wireless networks that use PSKs that the attacker may know are
   vulnerable to an attacker standing up an access point with the same
   SSID and PSK.  This is not specific to OWE, it affects all WiFi
   networks.

   This solution does not (directly) protect against disassociation
   attacks and the attacker observing the client authentication.  This
   is not specific to OWE.

   This solution does not claim to provide "strong" security, it is
   intended to be less insecure than "open" WiFi.  In order to avoid
   users assuming that they are getting more security than they really
   are, OWE protected networks do not get a "lock" icon then scanning
   for WiFi networks.

   Ideally users would only associate to networks that they trust, using
   WPA2-Enterprise (802.1X) with certificates that they trust, and then
   immediately use a VPN to a trusted endpoint.  However, open wifi is
   really convenient and users will continue to want it.  While
   abstinence is the best policy, OWE recognises that users will
   continue to behave in risky ways, and thus aims to make this slightly
   less risky...

8.  Privacy Considerations

   By making "open" wireless encrypted by default we aim to increase
   privacy by decreasing the incidence of passive eavesdropping by
   pervasive monitors and idle attackers.
