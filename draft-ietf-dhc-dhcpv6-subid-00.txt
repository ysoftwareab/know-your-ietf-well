Abstract

   This memo defines a new Relay Agent Subscriber-ID option for the
   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6).  The option
   allows a DHCPv6 relay agent to associate a stable "Subscriber-ID"
   with DHCPv6 client messages in a way that is independent of the
   client and of the underlying physical network infrastructure.

Internet-Draft          Relay Agent Subscriber-ID             April 2005


1.  Introduction

   DHCPv6 [1] provides IP addresses and configuration information for
   IPv6 clients.  It includes a relay agent capability, in which
   processes within the network infrastructure receive multicast
   messages from clients and relay them to DHCPv6 servers.  In some
   network environments, it will be useful for the relay agent to add
   information to the DHCPv6 message before relaying it.

   The information that relay agents supply can also be used in the
   server's decision making about the addresses, delegated prefixes [3],
   and configuration parameters that the client is to receive.

   In many service provider environments, it is believed to be desirable
   to associate some provider-specific information with clients' DHCPv6
   messages that is independent of the physical network configuration
   and which the relay agent has learned through some means which is
   outside the scope of this memo.

2.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [2].

3.  The Relay Agent Subscriber-ID Option

   In complex service provider environments, there is a need to connect
   a customer's DHCPv6 configuration with the customer's administrative
   information.  The Relay Agent Subscriber-ID option carries a value
   that can be independent of the physical network configuration through
   which the subscriber is connected.  This value complements, and might
   well be used in addition to, the network-based information.  The
   "subscriber-id" assigned by the provider is intended to be stable as
   customers connect through different paths, and as network changes
   occur.

   The subscriber-id information allows the service provider to assign/
   activate subscriber-specific actions, e.g. assignment of specific IP
   addresses, prefixes, DNS configuration, trigger accounting, etc.
   This option is de-coupled from the access network's physical
   structure, so subscriber moves from one access-point to another, for
   example, would not require reconfiguration at the service provider's
   DHCPv6 servers.

   The subscriber-id is an NVT ASCII [4] string.  The semantic contents
   of the subscriber-id field are of course provider-specific.  This
   specification does not establish any semantic requirements on the

   data in the string.

   The format of the DHCPv6 Relay Agent Subscriber-ID option is shown
   below:

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |     OPTION_SUBSCRIBER_ID      |         option-len            |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       .                                                               .
       .                         subscriber-id                         .
       .                                                               .
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

         option-code      OPTION_SUBSCRIBER_ID (TBD)

         option-len       length, in octets, of the subscriber-id field.
                          The minimum length is 1 octet.

         subscriber-id    A NVT ASCII string. It MUST NOT be null
                          terminated.


4.  DHCPv6 Relay Agent Behavior

   DHCPv6 relay agents MAY be configured to include a Subscriber-ID
   option in relayed (RELAY-FORW) DHCPv6 messages.  The subscriber-id
   strings themselves are assigned and configured through mechanisms
   that are outside the scope of this memo.

5.  DHCPv6 Server Behavior

   This option provides additional information to the DHCPv6 server.
   The DHCPv6 server, if it is configured to support this option, MAY
   use this information in addition to other relay agent option data,
   other options included in the DHCPv6 client messages, and physical
   network topology information in order to assign IP addresses,
   delegate prefixes, and/or other configuration parameters to the
   client.  There is no special additional processing for this option.

   There is no requirement that a server return this option and its data
   in a RELAY-REPLY message.

6.  Security Considerations

   See [1] section 21.1, on securing DHCPv6 messages sent between
   servers and relay agents, and section 23, on general DHCPv6 security

   considerations.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a DHCPv6 option code for the Relay Agent
   Subscriber-ID Option.
