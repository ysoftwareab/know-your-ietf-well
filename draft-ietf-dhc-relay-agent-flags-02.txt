Abstract

   This memo defines a new suboption of the DHCP relay agent information
   option that allows the DHCP relay to specify flags for the forwarded
   packet.  One flag is defined to indicate whether the DHCP relay
   received the packet via a unicast or broadcast packet.  This
   information may be used by the DHCP server to better serve clients
   based on whether their request was originally broadcast or unicast.

Internet-Draft         Relay Agent Flags Suboption          January 2007


1.  Introduction

   Any time a client's DHCP packet is broadcast, a local DHCP relay will
   process its request and forward it on to the DHCP server.  When the
   DHCP relay performs this function, it can be configured to use the
   DHCP relay agent information option to forward additional information
   to the DHCP server, which the server may then use to alter its
   processing algorithms.  Once the lease has been granted, however,
   future DHCP DHCPREQUEST/RENEWAL messages are unicast directly to the
   DHCP Server.  [RFC2131] [RFC2132] [RFC3046]

   In general, DHCP servers may also make subtle (and sometimes not so
   subtle) changes in their processing algorithms depending on whether
   or not the DHCP server received the message as a unicast packet from
   the DHCP client directly, a broadcast packet from the DHCP client on
   a locally connected network, or a unicast packet from a DHCP Relay
   Agent which has forwarded on a packet broadcast from a DHCP client
   connected to a network local to the DHCP Relay Agent.

   In some situations, DHCP Clients may unicast their DHCPREQUEST/RENEW
   packets to the DHCP Relay Agent, which will forward the packet on to
   the DHCP server.  In these cases, the DHCP server cannot tell whether
   the packet was broadcast or unicast by the DHCP client, and so it may
   be unable to process the DHCP client packets in the manner that it
   would if it knew whether the original DHCP packet was broadcast or
   unicast.

   The purpose of the suboption described in this document is to allow
   the DHCP relay to specify flags for the forwarded packet.  These
   flags can be used to describe DHCP client attributes that are useful
   to the DHCP server, but can only be detected by the local DHCP relay.
   The DHCP server can use the information provided by the DHCP relay to
   improve its processing algorithms.

   One flag is defined to indicate whether the DHCP relay received the
   packet via a unicast or broadcast packet.  This allows the DHCP
   server to know if a packet forwarded on by a DHCP Relay Agent was
   broadcast or unicast to the DHCP Relay Agent.


2.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft         Relay Agent Flags Suboption          January 2007


3.  The Flags Suboption

   The Flags suboption provides an extensible suboption definition for
   several possible flags.  The first flag defined is the unicast flag.

   The format of the suboption is:

          0                   1                   2
          0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |     Code      |    Length     |    Flags      |
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

           Code     The suboption code. (TBD, to be assigned by IANA).

           Length   The suboption length, 1 octet.

           Flags    The Relay Agent flags for this forwarded packet.

                       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
                      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                      |U|    MBZ      |
                      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                      U:  UNICAST flag

                           unicast = 1
                           broadcast = 0

                      MBZ:  MUST BE ZERO (reserved for future use)


4.  DHCP Relay Agent Behavior

   A DHCP relay agent MUST include this suboption in every Relay Agent
   Information Option [RFC3046] it adds to a forwarded DHCP request.  In
   this way, the DHCP server can distinguish a request forwarded from a
   DHCP relay agent which does not support the relay-agent-flags
   suboption from a request forwarded by a DHCP relay agent which
   supports the relay-agent-flags suboption and which received the
   request that is being forwarded in a broadcast packet.

   To put this another way, A DHCP relay agent which supports the relay-
   agent-flags suboption MUST always include it in every relay-agent-
   information-option that it inserts into packets which it forwards on
   to the DHCP server, whether the packet it is forwarding was received
   as a broadcast or as a unicast.  This is because the DHCP server will
   be dealing with DHCP relay agents that support the relay-agent-flags

   suboption as well as DHCP relay agents that do not support the relay-
   agent-flags suboption.


5.  DHCP Server Behavior

   This option provides additional information to the DHCP server.  The
   DHCP server MAY use this information to make processing decisions
   regarding the DHCP Client's packet which it is processing.  For
   instance, knowledge of the broadcast or unicast reception of a packet
   by a DHCP relay agent is important when making the processing
   decisions required to implement Load Balancing [RFC3074].

   The option length is one octet.  If the DHCP server receives a relay-
   agent-flags suboption that is longer than one octet, it MUST evaluate
   the first octet.


6.  Security Considerations

   Message authentication in DHCP for intradomain use where the out-of-
   band exchange of a shared secret is feasible is defined in [RFC3118].
   Potential exposures to attack are discussed in section 7 of the DHCP
   protocol specification in [RFC2131].

   The DHCP Relay Agent option depends on a trusted relationship between
   the DHCP relay agent and the server, as described in section 5 of
   [RFC3046].  While the introduction of fraudulent relay-agent options
   can be prevented by a perimeter defense that blocks these options
   unless the relay agent is trusted, a deeper defense using the
   authentication option for relay agent options [RFC4030] SHOULD be
   deployed as well.


7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a suboption number for the Flags
   Suboption from the DHCP Relay Agent Information Option [RFC3046]
   suboption number space.


8.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to David Hankins for realizing the problems created by the
   server-id-override option draft and for helping us understand the
   value of finally solving this problem in a way that has general
   applicability.
