1. Introduction 

   Wavelength switched optical networks (WSONs) are based on Wavelength 
   Division Multiplexing (WDM) in which user traffic is carried by data 
   channels of different optical wavelengths. In traditional WDM 
   Networks, each wavelength path is statically configured. With the 
   deployment of Reconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexers (ROADMs), 
   photonic cross-connects (PXCs), and tunable laser, WSONs have become 
   more dynamic, and operators can flexibly set up wavelength paths to 
   carry user traffic.  

   In WSONs where there are no or a limited number of switches capable 
   of wavelength conversion paths must be set up subject to the 
   "wavelength continuity" constraint. This leads to a path computation 
   problem known as routing and wavelength assignment (RWA). In order to

   perform such computations, it is necessary to collect information 
   about the available wavelengths within the network. 

   [WSON-Frame] provides a framework for applying GMPLS [RFC3945] and 
   the Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture [RFC4655] to the 
   control of WSONs to address the RWA problem. [WSON-Info] describes an 
   information model that specifies the information needed at various 
   points in a WSON in order to compute paths and establish Label 
   Switched Paths (LSPs). Based on the information model of [WSON-Info], 
   [WSON-Encode] provides efficient protocol-independent encodings of 
   the information needed by the RWA process in a WSON. Such encodings 
   can be used to extend GMPLS signaling and routing protocols.    

   Therefore, in order to enable GMPLS to support Routing and Wavelength 
   Assignment (RWA) in Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON) 
   networks, this document follows on from [WSON-Info], [WSON-Encode], 
   and [WSON-IGP-Eval] to define extensions to the OSPF routing protocol 
   to enhance the Traffic Engineering (TE) properties of GMPLS TE which 
   are defined in [RFC3630], [RFC4202], and [RFC4203]. The enhancements 
   to the Traffic Engineering (TE) properties of GMPLS TE links can be 
   announced in OSPF TE LSAs. The TE LSA, which is an opaque LSA with 
   area flooding scope [RFC3630], has only one top-level 
   Type/Length/Value (TLV) triplet and has one or more nested sub-TLVs 
   for extensibility. The top-level TLV can take one of three values (1) 
   Router Address [RFC3630], (2) Link [RFC3630], (3) Node Attribute 
   [OSPF-Node].  In this document, we enhance the sub-TLVs for the Link 
   TLV and Node Attribute TLV in support of RWA in WSON under the 
   control of GMPLS. 

   The detail encoding of OSPF extensions is not defined in this 
   document. [WSON-Encode] provides encoding detail.  

   No consideration of optical impairment routing related information is 
   included in this document. 

2. Node Information 

   According to [WSON-Info] and [WSON-Encode], the node information 
   about WSON nodes includes Node ID, connectivity matrix, wavelength 
   converter pool information. Except for the Node ID which should 
   comply with Routing Address described in [RFC3630], the other pieces 
   of information are defined in this document. 

   [OSPF-Node] defines a new top TLV named the Node Attribute TLV which 
   carries attributes related to a router/node. This Node Attribute TLV 
   contains one or more sub-TLVs.

Internet-Draft        OSPF Extensions for WSON               July 2009 
    

   From [WSON-Encode] we have identified the following new Sub-TLVs that 
   must be supported that can be nested under Node Attribute TLV. Detail 
   description for each newly defined Sub-TLV is provided in subsequent 
   sections:  

      Sub-TLV Type    Length       Name 

         TBD          variable    Connectivity Matrix 

         TBD          variable    Wavelength Converter Accessibility  

         TBD          variable    Wavelength Conversion Range 

         TBD          variable    WC Usage State 

2.1. Connectivity Matrix 

   It is necessary to identify which ingress ports and wavelengths can 
   be connected to (the same wavelength on) a specific egress port, 
   because the switching devices in a WSON are highly asymmetric. 

   The Connectivity Matrix is used to identify these restrictions, which 
   can represent either the potential connectivity matrix for asymmetric 
   switches (e.g. ROADMs and such) or fixed connectivity for an 
   asymmetric device such as a multiplexer as defined in [WSON-Info]. 

   The Connectivity Matrix is a sub-TLV (the type is TBD by IANA) of the 
   Node Attribute TLV. The length is the length of value field in octets. 
   The meaning and format of this sub-TLV are defined in [WSON-Info] and 
   [WSON-Encode]. One sub-TLV contains one matrix. The Connectivity 
   Matrix sub-TLV may occur more than once to contain multi-matrices 
   within the Node Attribute TLV. 

2.2. Wavelength Converter Pool 

   A WSON node may include wavelength converters. The encoding of 
   structure and properties of a general wavelength converter pool 
   utilizes a converter accessibility sub-TLV, a wavelength converter 
   range sub-TLV, and a wavelength converter state sub-TLV as described 
   in [WSON-Encode]. 

2.2.1. Wavelength Converter Accessibility  

   Wavelength Converter Accessibility represents the ability of an 
   ingress port to reach a wavelength converter and of a wavelength 
   converter to reach a particular egress port as described in [WSON-
   Encode].

Internet-Draft        OSPF Extensions for WSON               July 2009 
    

   The Wavelength Converter Accessibility is a sub-TLV (the type is TBD 
   by IANA) of the Node Attribute TLV. The length is the length of value 
   field in octets. The meaning and format of this sub-TLV are defined 
   in [WSON-Info] and [WSON-Encode]. The Wavelength Converter 
   Accessibility sub-TLV may occur at most once within the Node 
   Attribute TLV. 

2.2.2. Wavelength Conversion Range 

   Wavelength converters may have a limited input or output range which 
   can be described using one or more Wavelength Conversion Range sub-
   TLV as described in [WSON-Encode]. 

   The Wavelength Converter Range is a sub-TLV (the type is TBD by IANA) 
   of the Node Attribute TLV. The length is the length of value field in 
   octets. The meaning and format of this sub-TLV are defined in [WSON-
   Info] and [WSON-Encode]. The Wavelength Converter Range sub-TLV may 
   occur more than once within the Node Attribute TLV. 

2.2.3. WC Usage State 

   WC Usage Sate indicates the usage state of wavelength converters as 
   described in [WSON-Encode] 

   The WC Usage State is a sub-TLV (the type is TBD by IANA) of the Node 
   Attribute TLV. The length is the length of value field in octets. The 
   meaning and format of this sub-TLV are defined in [WSON-Info] and 
   [WSON-Encode]. The WC Usage State sub-TLV may occur at most once 
   within the Node Attribute TLV. 

3. Link Information 

   The most common link sub-TLVs nested to link top-level TLV are 
   already defined in [RFC3630], [RFC4203]. For example, Link ID, 
   Administrative Group, Interface Switching Capability Descriptor 
   (ISCD), Link Protection Type, Shared Risk Link Group Information 
   (SRLG), and Traffic Engineering Metric are among the typical link 
   sub-TLVs.  

   For WSONs, per [WSON-Info] and [WSON-Encode], we add the following 
   additional link sub-TLVs to the link-TLV in this document. 

    

      Sub-TLV Type    Length       Name 

         TBD          variable    WSON Port Wavelength Restrictions

Internet-Draft        OSPF Extensions for WSON               July 2009 
    

         TBD          variable    Available Wavelengths  

         TBD          variable    Shared Backup Wavelengths 

    

3.1. WSON Port Wavelength Restrictions 

   Port Wavelength Restrictions describes the wavelength (label) 
   restrictions that the link and various optical devices such as OXCs, 
   ROADMs, and waveband multiplexers may impose on a port. These 
   restrictions represent what wavelength may or may not be used on a 
   link and are relatively static. The detailed information about Port 
   wavelength restrictions is described in [WSON-Info]. 

   The WSON Port Wavelength Restrictions is a sub-TLV (the type is TBD 
   by IANA) of the Link TLV. The length is the length of value field in 
   octets. The meaning and format of this sub-TLV are defined in [WSON-
   Info] and [WSON-Encode]. The WSON Port Wavelength Restrictions sub-
   TLV may occur more than once to specify a complex port constraint 
   within the link TLV. 

3.2. Available Wavelengths   

   Available Wavelengths indicates the wavelengths available for use on 
   a link as described in [RWA-Encode].The Available Wavelengths is a 
   sub-TLV (the type is TBD by IANA) of the Link TLV. The length is the 
   length of value field in octets. The meaning and format of this sub-
   TLV are defined in [WSON-Info] and [WSON-Encode]. The Available 
   Wavelengths sub-TLV may occur at most once within the link TLV. 

   Note that there are five approaches for Wavelength Set which is used 
   to represent the Available Wavelengths described in [WSON-Encode]. 
   Considering that the continuity of the available or unavailable 
   wavelength set can be scattered for the dynamic wavelength 
   availability, so it may burden the routing to reorganize the 
   wavelength set information when the Inclusive (/Exclusive) List 
   (/Range) approaches are used to represent Available Wavelengths 
   information. Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that only the Bitmap Set be 
   used for representation Available Wavelengths information.  

3.3. Shared Backup Wavelengths 

   Shared Backup Wavelengths indicates the wavelengths available for 
   shared backup use on a link as described in [RWA-Encode].

Internet-Draft        OSPF Extensions for WSON               July 2009 
    

   The Shared Backup Wavelengths is a sub-TLV (the type is TBD by IANA) 
   of the Link TLV. The length is the length of value field in octets. 
   The meaning and format of this sub-TLV are defined in [WSON-Info] and 
   [WSON-Encode]. The Shared Backup Wavelengths sub-TLV may occur at 
   most once within the link TLV. 

4. Procedures for Routing Flooding 

   All the sub-TLVs are nested to top-level TLV(s) and contained in 
   Opaque LSAs. The flooding of Opaque LSAs must follow the rules 
   specified in [RFC2328], [RFC2370], [RFC3630], [RFC4203], [OSPF-Node]. 

   In the WSON networks, the node information and link information can 
   be classified as two kinds: one is relatively static information such 
   as Node ID, Connectivity Matrix information; the other is dynamic 
   information such as WC Usage State, Available Wavelengths information. 
   [WSON-Encode] give recommendations of typical usage of previously 
   defined sub-TLVs which contain relatively static information and 
   dynamic information. An implementation SHOULD take measures to avoid 
   frequent updates of relatively static information when the relatively 
   static information is not changed. A mechanism MAY be applied such 
   that static information and dynamic information are contained in 
   separate Opaque LSAs to avoid unnecessary updates of static 
   information when dynamic information is changed. 

   Note that as with other TE information, an implementation SHOULD take 
   measures to avoid rapid and frequent updates of routing information 
   that could cause the routing network to become swamped. A threshold 
   mechanism MAY be applied such that updates are only flooded when a 
   number of changes have been made to the wavelength availability 
   information within a specific time. Such mechanisms MUST be 
   configurable if they are implemented. 

5. Security Considerations 

   This document does not introduce any further security issues other   
   than those discussed in [RFC 3630], [RFC 4203]. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   [RFC3630] says that the top level Types in a TE LSA and Types for 
   sub-TLVs for each top level Types must be assigned by Expert Review, 
   and must be registered with IANA. 

   IANA is requested to allocate new Types for the sub-TLVs as defined 
   in Sections 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 as follows:
