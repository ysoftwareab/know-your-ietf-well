Abstract 
 
  The base Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) includes audit 
  commands that only allow a Call Agent to audit endpoint and/or 
  connection state one endpoint at a time. This document describes a 
  new MGCP package for bulk auditing of a group of gateway endpoints. 
  It allows a Call Agent to determine the endpoint naming convention, 
  the list of instantiated endpoints as well connection and endpoint 
  state for the group of endpoints. This is particularly important in 
  fail-over situations in which there are gateways that have large 
  numbers of endpoints.

1.0 Introduction 
 
  The base Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) [3] includes audit 
  commands that only allow a Call Agent to audit endpoint and/or 
  connection state, one endpoint at a time. This document describes a 
  new MGCP package for bulk auditing of a group of gateway endpoints. 
  It allows a Call Agent to determine the endpoint naming convention, 
  the list of instantiated endpoints as well connection and endpoint 
  state for the group of endpoints. This is particularly important in 
  fail-over situations in which there are gateways that have large 
  numbers of endpoints. 
 
 
2.0. Bulk Audit Package 
 
2.1. Package Definition 
 
  Package Name: BA 
   
  Package Version: 0 
   
  Package Description: This package provides the Call Agent the ability 
  to audit and obtain high-level view of endpoint and connection state 
  for a group of endpoints in a gateway.

2.1.1. Package Parameters 
   
  A new BulkRequestedInfo parameter is defined for use in the 
  AuditEndpoint command. The parameter can be used to request a compact 
  list of EndpointIds or to request a high level view of endpoint or 
  connection state for a group of endpoints as defined below: 
   
     ReturnCode, 
     [EndPointNameList,] 
     [InstantiatedEndpointList,] 
     [ConnectionCountList,] 
     [ConnectionModeList,] 
     [EndpointStateList,] 
     [NextEndpointName,] 
     [ReportedEndpointList] 
     <-- AuditEndPoint(EndpointId, 
                         [StartEndpointName,] 
                         [MaxNumEndpoints,] 
                         [BulkRequestedInfo]) 
   
  Unlike the normal RequestedInfo parameter in the base MGCP 
  specification, the BulkRequestedInfo parameter associated with the 
  Bulk Audits package can be used with "all-of" wildcards for auditing 
  a collection of endpoints. It is not an error to specify an 
  EndpointId without wildcards, however. 
   
  The following sub-sections describe the parameters associated with 
  the Bulk Audit Command in detail. Sections 2.1.1.1 and 2.1.1.2 
  describe the parameters that can be included with a request and 
  sections 2.1.1.3 to 2.1.1.8 describe return parameters.  
   
2.1.1.1. StartEndpointName and MaxNumEndpoints Parameters 
 
  Because wild-carding may not be sufficient to qualify the endpoints 
  of interest, further qualification can be provided by including a 
  StartEndpointName (the first endpoint of interest) and 
  MaxNumEndPoints (the maximum number of endpoints of interest). These 
  parameters are described according to the following Augmented BNF 
  (ABNF) Syntax (refer to RFC 2234 for ABNF syntax definitions): 
                  
     "BA/SE" ":" 0*WSP LocalEndpointName 
   
     "BA/NU" ":" 0*WSP MaxNumEndpoints 
   
  where MaxNumEndpoints is the decimal number of endpoints with a value 
  in the range 1 to 65535. The MaxNumEndpoints parameter SHOULD only be 
  included when requesting an audit for an EndpointStateList and/or 
  ConnectionCountList. If included in a request for the 
  EndPointNameList or InstantiatedEndpointList, it MAY be ignored. 
   
  Note that only the LocalEndpointName (see ABNF grammar in [3]) is 
  provided in request and response parameter lines for this package 
  rather than the full EndpointName. This is done for the sake of

                        MGCP Bulk Audit Package           December 2002 

  compactness, i.e. the domain name portion is left out since it is 
  already available in the command line portion of a given request.  
   
  If the list of endpoints defined by the StartEndpointName and 
  MaxNumEndPoints is outside the range designated by the wild-carding, 
  values a report will only be returned for endpoints up to those 
  specified within the wild-card range.  
 
2.1.1.2. BulkRequestedInfo Parameter 
 
  The BulkRequestedInfo parameter line is described according to the 
  following ABNF syntax definitions: 
   
     BulkRequestedInfo = "BA/F:" 0*WSP  
            *( EndpointOrInstantList *("," EndpointOrInstantList))  
          / *( EndpointOrConnState *("," EndpointOrConnState)) 
      
     EndpointOrConnState = "BA/C" / "BA/M" /  EndpointStateParam 
      
     EndpointOrInstantList = "BA/Z" / "BA/X" 
      
     EndpointStateParam = "BA/S" "(" StateType  
                                        0*("," 0*(WSP) StateType)")" 
      
     StateType = "I" / "D" / "N" / "S" / "H" 
   
  where the BulkRequestedInfo parameters have the following meaning: 
      
     * "BA/Z" is a request to return EndPointNameList 
     * "BA/X" is a request to return InstantiatedEndpointList 
     * "BA/C" is a request to return the ConnectionCountList 
     * "BA/M" is a request to return the ConnectionModeList 
     * "BA/S" is a request to return the EndpointStateList 
   
  Each of the parameters can be provided at most once in the 
  BulkRequestedInfo.  
   
  EndpointStateParam Parameter: 
   
     As indicated in the above ABNF, the EndpointStateParam parameter 
     is itself parameterized with one or more StateType parameters that 
     define the conditions to be evaluated for the endpoint: 
   
       * "I" - the endpoint is in-service, 
       * "D" - the endpoint is disconnected, 
       * "N" - the endpoint is in the notification state, 
       * "L" - the endpoint is in lockstep state (i.e. waiting for an 
          RQNT after a response to a NTFY has occurred while in 
          lockstep mode) 
       * "S" - there is an active on-off (OO) or timeout (TO) signal 
          on the endpoint, 
       * "H" - the hook-state is off-hook or the endpoint is in some 
          state other than "idle". The meaning of this last parameter 
          depends on the type of endpoint: 
 
Foster et al.                Informational                     [Page 4] 

                        MGCP Bulk Audit Package           December 2002 

          * The parameter has no meaning for stateless endpoints with 
            no hook-state associated with them such as ISUP trunks. In 
            this case, the endpoint is by definition in the "idle" 
            state for this parameter. 
          * For endpoints that have a state machine associated with 
            them (such as a CAS endpoint), the endpoint MUST be in some 
            state other than the "idle" state. 
          * In the case where the endpoint has hook-state associated 
            with it, the hook-state MUST be off-hook. In the case of 
            digital channel associated signaling (CAS) connections, 
            hook-state may be provided in either direction. If the 
            hook-state in either direction is off-hook, the endpoint is 
            considered non-idle, i.e. the condition is satisfied. 
      
     The list of StateTypes may be extended in the future. If an 
     unknown StateType is encountered, the command MUST be rejected 
     with error code 803 (i.e. "unsupported StateType"). 
 
     The report provided as a result of this request, yields an 
     indication of either "True", "False", or "Out of Service" for each 
     endpoint. If the endpoint is in-service and any one of the 
     criteria holds true, then the report for the endpoint will 
     evaluate to "True". A "False" indication will only be reported if 
     the endpoint is in-service and all criteria evaluate to false. The 
     report thus provides the logical "OR" function over the conditions 
     audited for endpoints in-service. Irrespective of the state being 
     audited, an "Out of Service" indication will always be reported if 
     the endpoint is considered out-of-service.  
   
     Note that the criteria "D", "N", "S" and "H" can only be true if 
     the endpoint is in-service, so that requesting "I" at the same 
     time (although allowed) would be unnecessary (i.e. redundant). 
   
  Example: If the request for EndpointStateList for one or more 
  endpoints includes the parameter line: 
      
     BA/F: BA/S(D,N) 
      
  indicating a request for a report on whether endpoints are 
  disconnected or in the notification state. If a given endpoint is in 
  either a "disconnected" or "notification" state, then the report will 
  indicate "True" for that endpoint. If the endpoint is neither in a 
  disconnected state nor in a notification state, but is in-service, 
  then the report for that endpoint will indicate "False". If the 
  endpoint is out-of-service, then the report for that endpoint will 
  indicate "Out of Service". 
   
  In order to only determine whether an endpoint is in-service or out-
  of service, the Call Agent should make a request with only the "I" 
  StateType parameter.

2.1.1.3. EndPointNameList and InstantiatedEndpointList Parameters 
   
  EndPointNameList Parameter: 
   
     The EndPointNameList is a list of the endpoint names (i.e. the 
     endpoint naming convention for the endpoints configured for 
     service) supported by the gateway as qualified by the wildcarded 
     EndPointId, and possibly StartEndPointName and MaxNumEndpoints 
     parameters. This list can include one or more lines in the 
     following ABNF format: 
      
      "BA/Z:" 0*WSP RangedLocalName 0*("," 0*WSP RangedLocalName) 
        
     where RangedLocalName is a LocalEndpointName that may include the 
     ranged wildcard notation described in Appendix E (section E.5) of 
     [3], i.e.: 
      
      RangeWildcard = "[" NumericalRange *( "," NumericalRange ) "]" 
      NumericalRange     = 1*(DIGIT) [ "-" 1*(DIGIT) ]. 
      
     Example: 
      
       ba/z: ds/ds1-1/[1-24], ds/ds1-2/[1-24], ds/ds1-3/[1-24] 
   
     or simply: 
      
       ba/z: ds/ds1-[1-3]/[1-24] 
        
     Any EndpointId that has a local name that matches any of the 
     values in the range notation is a valid endpoint. Since "[" is not 
     a reserved character for endpoint names, an endpoint name that 
     contains the character "[" SHALL escape each occurrence of the "[" 
     character in the endpoint name by using an extra "[" character. 
     For example, the endpoint name  
      
       ds/ds1-1/foo[bar]  
      
     is thus reported as  
        
       ds/ds1-1/foo[[bar]  
      
     Use of the "[" character in endpoint names for endpoints that 
     support this package is discouraged. 
      
     Note that the ranged wildcard notation (RangeWildcard above) also 
     allows commas between ranges like: 
      
       ba/z: ds/ds1-1/[1,3-5,8-24] 
      
  For virtual endpoints, that are automatically created and deleted on 
  the fly by the gateway, there is a difference between reporting the 
  endpoint names (i.e. the "naming convention") used in describing the 
  endpoints and reporting the actual endpoints that are instantiated at 
  the time the request is made. For this case: 
 
Foster et al.                Informational                     [Page 6] 

                        MGCP Bulk Audit Package           December 2002 

   
     * EndPointNameList is a request to return the naming convention 
       and 
   
     * InstantiatedEndpointList is a request to return the "real" (or 
       instantiated) endpoints. 
      
  InstantiatedEndpointList Parameter: 
   
     The syntax of the InstantiatedEndpointList value is the same as 
     the EndPointNameList value returned with EndPointNameList, i.e., a 
     number of lines may be returned with the following syntax: 
      
       "BA/X:" 0*WSP RangedLocalName 0*("," 0*WSP RangedLocalName) 
      
  In the case of hard-wired/physical endpoints (such as DSO's) or other 
  persistent endpoints, the InstantiatedEndpointList would normally not 
  be requested. However, if it is requested, the 
  InstantiatedEndpointList and the EndPointNameList will be the same. 
      
  For virtual endpoints that are not persistent, an "all of" wild card 
  ("*") is returned for the leftmost term of the name, which is 
  dynamically assigned in the EndPointNameList to indicate that 
  arbitrary names apply, and that the endpoints are virtual and non-
  persistent. The "all of" wild card notation MUST NOT be used when 
  returning the EndPointNameList for persistent endpoints however. The 
  following example illustrates this: 
   
  ba/z: announcement/* 
  ba/z: foo/bar/* 
  ba/z: foo/foo/* 
   
  The "all of" wildcard tells us, that "announcement" is simply the 
  leftmost term for a dynamic set of non-persistent virtual endpoints. 
  To instantiate one of these endpoints, we would include the "any of" 
  wildcard (e.g. "announcement/$") as the LocalEndpointName in the 
  EndpointId of a request (e.g. NotificationRequest or 
  CreateConnection). The response would then include the 
  SpecificEndpointId indicating the instantiated endpoint. Also note in 
  the above example, that "foo" defines two different levels of non-
  persistent virtual endpoints.

2.1.1.4. ConnectionCountList  
   
  The ConnectionCountList indicates the number of connections on a 
  series of endpoints. It consists of a number of lines with the 
  following ABNF syntax: 
   
     "BA/C:" 0*WSP NumConnections 0*(NumConnections) 
      
  where NumConnections is either: 
   
     * a hexadecimal digit indicating the number of connections on the 
       endpoint corresponding to the position on the list, or 
     * the letter "Z" indicating that there are more than 15 
       connections on this endpoint. 
   
2.1.1.5. ConnectionModeList 
   
  The ConnectionModeList indicates the connection modes for all the 
  connections on a series of endpoints. It consists of a number of 
  lines with the following ABNF syntax: 
   
     "BA/M:" 0*WSP ModeOrCount 0*(ModOrCount) 
      
     ModeOrCount = ConnCount / ConnMode 
      
     ConnMode = "I" / "S" / "R" / "B" / "C" / "L" / "T" / "N" / "U" 
      
  where ConnCount is either hexadecimal value corresponding to 0-15 
  connections on an endpoint or the value "Z", indicating that more 
  than 15 connections are present. 
   
  ConnMode indicates the connection mode where: 
   
       * "I" indicates "inactive" connection mode 
       * "S" indicates "sendonly" connection mode 
       * "R" indicates "recvonly" connection mode 
       * "B" indicates "sendrecv" connection mode 
       * "C" indicates "confrnce" connection mode 
       * "L" indicates "loopback" connection mode 
       * "T" indicates "conttest" connection mode 
       * "N" indicates "netwloop" connection mode 
       * "U" indicates some other connection mode 
   
  If an endpoint has no connections on it, ModeOrCount is given the 
  value "0". If there is one connection associated with the endpoint, 
  the symbol for the connection mode (ConnMode) is provided. If on the 
  other hand there are from 2 to 15 connections, a symbol representing 
  the number of connections (ConnCount) is provided followed by a list 
  of symbols indicating the connection mode (ConnMode) for each 
  connection. If there are more than 15 connections, "Z" is indicated 
  for ConnCount and no connection modes are provided for the 
  connections on that endpoint.

2.1.1.6. EndpointStateList Parameter 
   
  The EndpointStateList gives an overview of the endpoint state for a 
  series of endpoints. It consists of a number of lines with the 
  following ABNF syntax: 
   
     "BA/S:" 0*WSP EndPointState 0*(EndPointState) 
      
     EndPointState = "T" / "F" / "O" 
      
  where: 
   
     * "T" indicates "True" 
     * "F" indicates "False" 
     * "O" indicates "Out of Service" 
   
  The "True" or "False" determination is based on the criteria supplied 
  in StateType parameters when the request is made.  
   
  Note that the EndPointState indicator does not say anything about the 
  connection state of the endpoint. 
 
2.1.1.7. NextEndpointName Parameter 
 
  The NextEndpointName parameter will be included in the return, if 
  there are additional endpoints in this gateway covered by the wild-
  carded endpoint name that were not reported, but for which 
  information is available to be reported. 
   
  Note that the NextEndpointName is the LocalEndpointName (as opposed 
  to EndpointName) of the next endpoint after the last endpoint 
  reported. The syntax is as follows: 
   
     "BA/NE" ":" 0*WSP LocalEndpointName 
   
  A gateway may supply a report that is shorter than the request if the 
  resulting report would have resulted in a message that would be too 
  large (i.e. such that the report is larger than the maximum datagram 
  size). In the case where the gateway supplied a response for less 
  endpoints than requested, the gateway MUST supply NextEndpointName in 
  the response. 
   
  In order to continue the audit on a following set of endpoints, the 
  Call Agent can make a further request by using the NextEndpointName 
  as the starting point (e.g. as the StartEndpointName in a following 
  request). 
   
2.1.1.8. ReportedEndpointList Parameter 
 
  A ReportedEndpointList MUST be provided in a response line before 
  list(s) of EndpointStateList and/or ConnectionCountList in order to 
  clearly specify the list of endpoints that are being reported. The 
  ABNF syntax is as follows: 
   
 
Foster et al.                Informational                     [Page 9] 

                        MGCP Bulk Audit Package           December 2002 

  "BA/EL:" 0*WSP LimitedRangedName 0*("," 0*WSP LimitRangedName) 
   
  where LimitedRangedName is a LocalEndpointName that may include a 
  ranged wildcard notation (RangeWildcard syntax indicated earlier). 
  However, unlike the RangedLocalName that allows the range wildcard 
  notation to be used on multiple terms of the local name at the same 
  time, LimitedRangedName only allows the range notation to be used for 
  the last term, i.e. the following is valid: 
   
     ba/el: ds/ds1-1/[1,3-5,8-24] 
      
  or 
      
     ba/el: ds/ds1-1/[1-24], ds/ds1-2/[1-24], ds/ds1-3/[1-24] 
      
  However, the following is not valid: 
      
     ba/el: ds/ds1-[1-3]/[1-24] 
      
  Note that a single bulk audit request may include a request to return 
  both ConnectionCountList and EndpointStateList. However, the 
  resulting report that includes both MUST cover the same endpoints.  
   
  A single bulk audit request may also include a request to return both 
  EndPointNameList and InstantiatedEndpointList. However, requests for 
  either an EndPointNameList and/or an InstantiatedEndpointList MUST 
  NOT include a request for either ConnectionCountList or 
  EndpointStateList. 
   
2.1.2. Bulk Auditing of Non-persistent Virtual Endpoints 
 
  Note that gateways that have non-persistent virtual endpoints may 
  have instantiated endpoints that are disjoint with respect to the 
  name space. The ReportedEndpointList in front of a 
  ConnectionCountList and/or EndpointStateList describes exactly which 
  endpoints are being reported. 
   
  Example: 
   
     A Call Agent requests to know about the EndPointNameList for the 
     endpoints on a conference bridge: 
      
     AUEP 1200 *@gw1.x.net MGCP 1.0 
     BA/F: BA/Z 
      
  Response: 
   
     200 1200 OK 
     ba/z: cnf/* 
   
  This indicates the naming convention but in fact not all of these 
  endpoints are instantiated. A request for the list of instantiated 
  endpoints, i.e.:

                        MGCP Bulk Audit Package           December 2002 

     AUEP 1201 cnf/*@gw1.x.net MGCP 1.0 
     BA/F: BA/X 
   
  might yield: 
   
     200 1201 OK 
     ba/x: cnf/[1-3] 
     ba/x: cnf/[6-12] 
      
  indicating that only these particular endpoints are instantiated. 
   
  Suppose the Call Agent now asks for the ConnectionCountList i.e.: 
   
     AUEP 1202 cnf/*@gw1.x.net MGCP 1.0 
     BA/F: BA/C 
   
  The resulting instantiated virtual endpoints may be disjoint, which 
  would be indicated by the ReportedEndpointList in front of the 
  ConnectionCountList, e.g.: 
   
     200 1202 OK 
     ba/el: cnf/[1-3] 
     ba/c: 035 
     ba/el: cnf/[6-12] 
     ba/c: 3450333 
      
  or alternatively: 
   
     200 1202 OK 
     ba/el: cnf/[1-3], ba/el: cnf/[6-12] 
     ba/c: 035 
     ba/c: 3450333 
      
  or 
   
     200 1202 OK 
     ba/el: cnf/[1-3], ba/el: cnf/[6-12] 
     ba/c: 0353450333 
   
 
2.1.3. Package Specific Return Codes 
 
  The following return codes are specific to this package: 
   
          800     Invalid NextEndpointName 
          801     Invalid StartEndpointName 
          802     Invalid or unsupported BulkRequestInfo Parameter 
          803     Invalid or unsupported StateType 
          804     Bulk Audit Type not supported 
          805     Incorrectly specified endpoint range 
          806     Requested StartEndpoint unknown or unavailable

                        MGCP Bulk Audit Package           December 2002 

  Note that package specific error codes includes the package name 
  following the error code. For example, if error code 801 occurs in 
  response to a request with a transaction ID of 1001 it would be sent 
  as: 
   
     801 1001 /BA 
   
2.2. Examples of Package Use 
 
2.2.1. Endpoint List 
   
  This section contains examples of obtaining the list of endpoints. 
   
  Example 1: This is an example of a gateway that contains a single OC3 
  that contains a single level of hierarchy at the T1 level. 
   
  The request is made: 
   
     AUEP 1200 *@gw1.x.net MGCP 1.0 
     BA/F: BA/Z 
   
  This may result in a single "BA/Z" term with ranges specifying all of 
  the endpoints. 
   
     200 1200 OK 
     ba/z: ds/ds1-[1-84]/[1-24] 
   
  Example 2: In this example the gateway has 10 analog lines and a 
  single T1. The same request is made as in example 1, but now the 
  response is: 
   
     200 1200 OK 
     ba/z: aaln/[1-10] 
     ba/z: ds/ds1-1/[1-24] 
   
2.2.2. Connection Count List 
 
  Example1: Audit the number of connections on endpoints of a single 
  E1:  
      
     AUEP 2111 ds/e1-3/*@gw1.net 
     BA/F: BA/C 
      
  Response: 
      
     200 2111 OK 
     BA/EL: ds/e1-3/[1-30] 
     BA/C:  012111210001000001000001000010 
 
  Example 2: Audit the number of connections on endpoints of a DS3: 
      
     AUEP 1144 ds/ds3-1/*@gateway.net 
 
Foster et al.                Informational                    [Page 12] 

                        MGCP Bulk Audit Package           December 2002 

     BA/F: BA/C 
      
  Response: 
      
     200 1144 OK 
     BA/EL: ds/ds3-1/[1-192] 
     BA/C:  010000010001000001000001 
     BA/C:  001000000101000000001001 
     : 
     . 
     BA/C:  011000100010000010000010 
     BA/C:  011111010001000001000001 
     BA/C:  011000001100000001000001 
     BA/NE: ds/ds3-1/193 
      
  In this case, the response provided by the gateway contained 
  information about the first 192 endpoints. If the ds-3 contained a T1 
  hierarchy, the "BA/EL" and "BA/NE" values would indicate that 
  hierarchy e.g.: 
   
     200 1144 OK 
     BA/EL: ds/ds3-1/ds1-1/[1-24] 
     BA/C:  010000010001000001000001 
     BA/EL: ds/ds3-1/ds1-2/[1-24] 
     BA/C:  001000000101000000001001 
     : 
     . 
     BA/EL: ds/ds3-1/ds1-6/[1-24] 
     BA/C:  011000100010000010000010 
     BA/EL: ds/ds3-1/ds1-7/[1-24] 
     BA/C:  011111010001000001000001 
     BA/EL: ds/ds3-1/ds1-8/[1-24] 
     BA/C:  011000001100000001000001 
     BA/NE: ds/ds3-1/ds1-9/1 
   
  The Call Agent could continue to request endpoints by indicating the 
  starting endpoint where it left off, i.e. simply using the returned 
  "BE/NE" value as the "BA/SE" value for the next request: 
      
     AUEP 1145 ds/ds3-3/*@gw1.net 
     BA/F: BA/C 
     BA/SE: ds/ds3-1/ds1-9/1 
      
  Example 3: In this case, the Call Agent wants to know about the 
  connection state of 12 DS0's starting with the endpoint with the 
  LocalEndpointName "ds/ds3-1/ds1-6/4": 
      
     AUEP 1146 ds/ds3-1/*@gw1.net 
     BA/F: BA/C 
 
Foster et al.                Informational                    [Page 13] 

                        MGCP Bulk Audit Package           December 2002 

     BA/SE: ds/ds3-1/ds1-6/4 
     BA/NU: 12 
   
  Response: 
      
     200 1144 OK 
     BA/EL: ds/ds3-1/ds1-6/[4-15] 
     BA/C:  011000010001 
     BA/NE: ds/ds3-1/ds1-6/16 
   
2.2.3. Connection Mode List 
 
  Example: Audit the connection modes for connections on the endpoints 
  of a single E1:  
      
     AUEP 2111 ds/e1-3/*@gw1.net 
     BA/F: BA/M 
      
  Response: 
      
     200 2111 OK 
     BA/EL: ds/e1-3/[1-30] 
     BA/M:  0R2BRBBB2RRB000B00000B00000B0000B0 
   
  This shows that: 
   
     * Endpoint ds/e1-3/1 has no connections 
     * Endpoint ds/e1-3/2 has one connection and it is in "recvonly" 
       mode. 
     * Endpoint ds/e1-3/3 has two connections which are in "sendrecv" 
       and "recvonly" mode 
     * Endpoints ds/e1-3/4 to ds/e1-3/6 each have one connection - in 
       "sendrecv" mode in all cases 
     * Endpoints ds/e1-3/7 has two connections, both in "recvonly" mode 
     * etc. 
   
2.2.4. Endpoint State 
   
  Endpoint state requests and responses are similar. An example of 
  requesting endpoint state similar to example 3 in the previous 
  section: 
   
     AUEP 1150 ds/ds3-1/*@gw1.net 
     BA/F: BA/S(I) 
     BA/SE: ds/ds3-1/ds1-6/4 
     BA/NU: 12 
   
  Response: 
      
     200 1150 OK 
     BA/EL: ds/ds3-1/ds1-6/[4-15] 
 
Foster et al.                Informational                    [Page 14] 

                        MGCP Bulk Audit Package           December 2002 

     BA/S:  TOOTTOOTTOOT 
     BA/NE: ds/ds3-1/ds1-6/16 
   
  The request for in-service endpoints returns "True" for all endpoints 
  in-service, and "O" for all endpoints "Out of Service".  
   
  A similar request but with additional parameters might be: 
   
     AUEP 1151 ds/ds3-1/*@gw1.net 
     BA/F: BA/S(H,N) 
     BA/SE: ds/ds3-1/ds1-6/4 
     BA/NU: 12 
   
  Response: 
      
     200 1151 OK 
     BA/EL: ds/ds3-1/ds1-6/[4-15] 
     BA/S:  FFFTFFFFFFFO 
     BA/NE: ds/ds3-1/ds1-6/16 
   
  This indicates that at least one of the StateType parameters "H" 
  (off-hook) and "N" (notification state) evaluated to true for the 
  endpoints that have a "T" associated with then (i.e. ds/ds3-1/ds1-6/7 
  and ds/ds3-1/ds1-6/16 since the request started from ds/ds3-1/ds1-
  6/4). All other endpoints are neither off-hook nor in the 
  "notification state". Note that endpoint ds/ds3-1/ds1-6/15 is marked 
  as being out-of-service.  
   
  It is possible to request both connection state and endpoint state in 
  the same request such as: 
   
     AUEP 1151 ds/ds3-1/*@gw1.net 
     BA/F: BA/S(H,N), BA/C 
     BA/SE: ds/ds3-1/ds1-6/4 
     BA/NU: 12 
   
  In this case, the response might be: 
   
     200 1151 OK 
     BA/EL: ds/ds3-1/ds1-6/[4-15] 
     BA/S:  FFFTFFFFFFFO 
     BA/C:  011000010001 
     BA/NE: ds/ds3-1/ds1-6/16
