Abstract

   RFC 4893 defines BGP support for four-octet AS number space for
   handling AS_PATH attributes and "My ASN" value in BGP OPEN messages.
   Foue-Octet AS specific Extended Community attribute formats are
   defined in draft-rekhter-as4octet-ext-community-03.txt.  However, an
   implementation compliant to RFC 4893 does not necessarily provide
   support for 4-Octet Route-distinguisher, Route-target or Site-of-
   origin in the BGP-MPLS-VPN.  Thus BGP capability exchange for
   extended AS number attribute does not cover the BGP-MPLS-VPN AS4-
   specific route-attributes and route-distinguishers.  This document
   proposes an optional BGP capability exchange between the Provider
   Edge (PE) routers in order to communicate the intention of handling
   4-Octet or 2-Octet exteneded AS-specific Route-targets or Site-of-

   Origins or being able to handle and inteprete the 4-Octet route-

1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   RFC 4893[AS4PATH] defines BGP support for four-octet AS number space
   for handling AS_PATH attributes and "My ASN" value in BGP OPEN
   messages.  Foue-Octet AS specific Extended Community attribute
   formats are defined in [AS4-EXTCOM].  However, an implementation
   compliant to RFC 4893[AS4PATH] does not necessarily provide support
   for 4-Octet Route-distinguisher, Route-target or Site-of-origin in
   the BGP-MPLS-VPN.  Thus BGP capability exchange for extended AS
   number attribute does not cover the BGP-MPLS-VPN AS4-specific route-
   attributes and route-distinguishers.  This document proposes an
   optional BGP capability exchange between the Provider Edge (PE)
   routers in order to communicate the intention of handling 4-Octet or
   2-Octet exteneded AS-specific Route-targets or Site-of-Origins or
   being able to handle and inteprete the 4-Octet route-distinguishers
   correctly.  This capability parameter will be part of OPEN message
   during the BGP session initiation.

   Provider Edge (PE) rotuers [BGP-MPLS] are normally configured with
   Route-distinguishers (RD), Route-targets(RT).  RFC 4364 [BGP-MPLS]
   states that a PE router may assign a Site Of origin in order to
   prevent routing loops when CEs use private non-unique AS numbers.

   In the following diagram, PE1 and PE2 belong to the same autonomous
   system.  But they may run two different vendors' implementations.
   Even though both PEs can be compliant to RFC 4893, it is possible
   that they may not support 4-Octet AS specific Route-target(RT) or
   Route-distinguishers(RD) at the same time.  The capability exchange
   on handling 4-octet AS-specific Route-target, Route distinguishers
   and Site Of Origin is needed for two PEs to interoperate efficiently
   in interpreting each-other's route-attributes and RDs in a VPN-IPv4
   or VPN-IPv6 prefixes.  So far, the Route-target and Site Of Orgin are
   used as extended community attributes with 2byte AS number format,
   thus static configurations on different PEs were sufficient.  With
   the introduction of 4-Octet AS specific extended communities
   [AS4-EXTCOM] and 4-Octet AS specifc RDs [BGP-MPLS], static
   configurations in different PEs are not enough; if one does not
   support the 4-octet RT for example, it the other expects 4-Octet RTs
   the sessions will be reset in the middle of the session and routing
   outage will take place.  This capability negotiation will be also
   useful for inter-AS BGP-MPLS-VPN scenario option C. This document

Internet-Draft      AS4-specific PE-Route Capability           July 2008


   introduces a new capability message for BGP-MPLS-VPN scenarios for
   handling OLD and NEW implementations which support extended AS-
   specific routing attributes.  The following sections will detail the
   format of AS-specifc routing capability messages.


  ------------         -------------        ---------       -------------        ------------
  |          |         |           |        |        |      |           |        |          |                       |
  |   CE1    |---------|     PE1   |--------|  P     |----- |      PE2  |--------|  CE2     |
  |          |         |           |        |        |      |           |        |          |                    |

                         rd = 1:100                           rd = 2:200
                         rt = 200:300                         rt = 200:300
                         (2byte format)                       (4byte format)
                           configured                           configured


      A scenario with PEs supporting 2byte and 4byte AS-specific ext-
                                communities


3.  Terminology

   OLD implementation: A BGP speaker which is RFC 4364[BGP-MPLS]
   compliant and does not implement 4byte extension to the AS number as
   defined in RFC 4893 or it implements RFC 4893, but does not implement
   AS4-specific extended RT, SOO communities or 4-octet AS specific RDs.

   NEW implementation: A BGP speaker which implements the 4-byte AS
   number support as defined in RFC 4893 and it supports As4-specific
   extended communities [AS4-EXTCOM]


4.  Use BGP Capability advertisement

   The AS-specific routing capability message will be used during OPEN
   message as defined in RFC 4271.  This capability message SHOULD be
   used in conjuction with Extended AS capability message defined in RFC
   4893.

   The fields in the Capabilities Optional Parameter are set as follows.
   The Capability type Code field is TBD (to be assigned by IANA).  The
   Capability Length field is set to 2.  The Capability Value field is
   defined as:

Internet-Draft      AS4-specific PE-Route Capability           July 2008


             The use and meaning of this field is as follow:


                           0              7              15
                           +-------+-------+-------+-------+
                           | Resvd | |D|S|R| Resvd | RT-val|
                           +-------+-------+-------+-------+

      Resvd - These 4 bits are reserved for future use
      D - If D bit is on the implementation sends and receives 4-octet
      AS-specific RD format
      S - If S bit is on, then implementation sends and receives 4-octet
      AS-specific Site Of Origin attributes along with the VPN routes
      R - If R bit is on, the implementation is able to send and receive
      4-octet AS specific RT format
      RT-val - If this value is 1, the PE is able to export 4-octet AS-
      specific RTs; if this value is 2 the PE is able to import 4-octet
      AS-specific RT attributes

   Please note that a NEW implementation supporting the above
   capabilities SHOULD be able to optionally support 2-octet AS-specific
   RD, RT and Site of origin attributes as per the local configuration.
   The NEW implementation is not capable of converting the 2-octet AS
   specific to 4-octet AS specific attributes for a given route.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests a BGP capability type code from IANA.
