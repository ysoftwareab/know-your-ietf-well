Internet Draft             IPPM reporting MIB                  June 2002 
                                     
                                     
    
    
1. Introduction 
    
   This memo defines a MIB for managing the measures using the IP 
   performance metrics specified by the IPPM Working Group. 
    
   It specifies the objects to manage the results of the measure of 
   metrics standardized by IPPM Working Group. They are built on notions 
   introduced and discussed in the IPPM Framework document, RFC 2330 
   [2]. 
    
   This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB), and as such  
   it is intended to be respectful of the "Boilerplate for IETF MIBs" 
   defined in http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-boilerplate.html. 
 
   There are companion documents to the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB both in the 
   Transport Area (See section 2), and in the Operations and Management 
   Area (See section 3). The reader should be familiar with these 
   documents.  
 
2. The IPPM Framework 
    
   The IPPM Framework consists in 3 major components: 
    
        A general framework for defining performance metrics, described  
   in the Framework for IP Performance Metrics, RFC 2330 [2]; 
         
        A set of standardized metrics which conform to this framework: 
   The IPPM Metrics for Measuring Connectivity, RFC 2678 [3]; The One-
   way Delay Metric for IPPM, RFC 2679 [4]; The One-way Packet Loss 
   Metric for IPPM, RFC 2680 [5]; The Round-trip Delay Metric for IPPM, 
   RFC 2681 [6]. 
 
   Emerging metrics that are being specified in respect of this 
   framework. 
 
    
3. The SNMP Management Framework 
    
   The SNMP Management Framework consists of five major components: 
    
        An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [7]. 
    
        Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the 
   purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of 
   Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, 
   RFC 1155 [8], STD 16, RFC 1212 [9] and RFC 1215 [10].  The second 
   version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [11], STD 58, 
   RFC 2579 [12] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [13].

        Message protocols for transferring management information. The 
   first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and 
   described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [14]. A second version of the SNMP 
   message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, 
   is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [15] and RFC 1906 [16].  
   The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and 
   described in RFC 1906 [16], RFC 2572 [17] and RFC 2574 [18]. 
    
        Protocol operations for accessing management information. The 
   first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is 
   described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [14].  A second set of protocol 
   operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [19]. 
    
        A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [20] and 
   the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 [21]. 
    
   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework 
   can be found in RFC 2570 [22]. 
 
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are 
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI. 
    
   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A 
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate 
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically 
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no 
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable 
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in 
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine 
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the 
   MIB. 
 
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are 
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) 
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an 
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.   
    
   The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely 
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human 
   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to 
   refer to the object type.

4. Overview 
    
   Although the number of measurement devices that implement IPPM 
   metrics is growing, there is not currently any standardized 
   management interface to manage remotely the results of these metrics. 
   This memo defines a Management Information Base for managing the 
   results of the measures of IPPM metrics.  
    
   To permit metrics to be referenced by other MIBs and other protocols, 
   the IPPM WG has defined a registry of the current metrics and a 
   framework for the integration of future metrics in [IPPM metrics 
   registry]. 
    
   As the specification of new metrics is a continuous process, this 
   memo defines a framework for the integration of the future 
   standardized metrics. To address future needs Specialized tables may 
   be created, while augmenting the definition of the ippmMeasureTable. 
    
   The MIB architecture is inspired by the RMON model [23],[24] which 
   specifies the MIB for the monitoring of a single point of measure. 
   The IPPM-REPORTING-MIB differs from this model in that IPPM metrics 
   measurement involves several points of measures and requires common 
   references for time and for measure identification. The IPPM-
   REPORTING-MIB defines an absolute timeFilter. 
    
   The IPPM-REPORTING-MIB introduces a framework where each application 
   identifies its measures in an owner namespace. Using the namespace 
   framework, an application may grant other owners access to its 
   measure results for aggregated metrics computation, reporting, or 
   alarming. 
 
   Different architectures may be used to perform metric measurements, 
   using a control protocol and a test protocol. Different control 
   frameworks are suitable for performing a measure. The memo lists 
   them, while also looking for a way to integrate them  with the IPPM-
   REPORTING-MIB . This section is informational, but helps to specify 
   the relationship among the test protocol, the control protocol and 
   IPPM-REPORTING-MIB. 
    
   Special care has been taken to provide a reporting mode suitable for 
   control protocol and test protocol. It addresses the need to provide 
   access to results for the applications. Moreover, it may be used to 
   reduce the number of control frameworks. 
    
   This MIB is intended to handle multiple concurrent access by SNMP 
   applications. They are not in constant contact with the measurement 
   devices. For this reason, this MIB allows continuous measures 
   collection and statistics computation.

   The objects defined in this document are not intended for direct 
   manipulation.. 
    
4.1. Textual Conventions 
    
      Five types of data are introduced as a textual convention in this 
   MIB document: TypeP,GMTDateAndTime, GmtTimeFilter, 
   IppmReportDefinition and IppmStandardMetrics. 
 
 
4.1.1. Packet of type P 
    
   Section 13 of the IPPM framework [2] introduces the generic notion of 
   a "packet of type P" because in some contexts the metric's value 
   depends on the type of the packets involved in the metric. In the 
   definition of a metric, the type P will be explicitly defined, 
   partially defined, or left generic. Measurement of metrics defined 
   with generic type P are made specific when performing actual 
   measurements. This naming convention serves as an important reminder 
   that one must be conscious of the exact type of traffic being 
   measured. 
    
   The standardization of the management of the IPPM measures relies on 
   the capability to configure finely and unambiguously the type P of 
   the packets, and the parameters of the protocol suites of the type P. 
    
   RMON2 introduced the concept of protocol identifiers. The RFC2895 
   [25] specifies a macro for the definition of protocol identifier. The 
   RFC2896 [26] defines the protocol identifiers for different protocol 
   encapsulation trees. 
    
   The type P implementation relies on the MACRO PROTOCOL-IDENTIFIER  
   defined for identifying protocol suites in RMON2. It is achieved by 
   defining the TypeP as a new syntax in SMIv2 TEXTUAL-CONVENTION. 
    
4.1.1.1. Internet addresses 
    
   The section 14 of the IPPM framework defines (for the usual case of a 
   unidirectional path through the Internet) the term "Src" and "Dst". 
   "Src" denotes the IP address of the beginning of the path, and "Dst" 
   denotes the IP address of the end.  
    
   The section 3 of the RMON PI Reference specifies the Protocol 
   Identifier Encoding rules which consists briefly in a recursive 
   length value format. "Src" and "Dst" are protocol identifier 
   parameters. Their values are encoded in separated fields using the 
   protocol identifier encoding rule, but without trailing parameters. 
    
   The packet encapsulation defined in an instance of TypeP embeds the  
   format of "Src" and "Dst" and their values. These addresses type and

   value depend on the type P of the packet, IP version 4, V6, IP in 
   IP... Both participate to the completion of the packet encoding.  
    
   Examples: 
    
   RFC2896 defines the protocol identifiers ip and ipip4. Should there 
   be an Internet tunnel end-point of the IP address 192.168.1.1 in the 
   tunnel 128.2.6.7. The TypeP of the source address of the tunnel, Src, 
   is 8.0.0.8.0.0.0.0.17.2.0.0 (ip.ipip4). The trailer 2.0.0 in the 
   TypeP indicates that there are 2 parameters. In the IPPM context 
   these 2 parameters are provided in Src, which has the value 
   10.4.192.168.1.1.4.128.2.6.7.  
    
    
4.1.2. GMTDateAndTime 
    
   This textual convention defines the date and time, and is represented 
by the following format: year, month, day, hour, minutes, seconds, 
fractions of second.  
 
The first part is human readable. The fields year, month, day, hour, 
minutes are seconds are printable characters. 
 
The last field is the fraction of second. The fraction step is 250 
picoseconds.  
 
or example, 50 ms is 200000000 times 250 picosecond which correspond to 
0BEBC200'H. 0001000201090200010501000BEBC200 represent 8:15pm, 10 
econds and 50 ms GMT on 19 February 2001 and is displayed as 01-02-
9,20:15:10, 200000000. 
    
4.1.3. GmtTimeFilter 
    
GmtTimeFilter uses an absolute reference of time, and is intended to be 
used for the index of a table. It allows an application to download only 
those rows changed since a particular time. A row is considered changed 
if the value of any object in the row changes, or if the row is created 
or deleted. 
 
Each new conceptual row will be associated with the timeMark instance 
that was created at the value of ippmTimeSysTimer. 
 
It is intended to provide an absolute timestamp index for the results of 
measures. Typically for each singleton produced by an IPPM measure is 
associated the timemark corresponding to the moment of the measure.

LetÆs assume there are two measure rows in the measure table 
(measureIndex == 1, measureIndex == 2) which produced results 
asynchronously (e.g. made at Poisson intervals or sibling) and logged 
them in the result table. 
 
LetÆs also assume that Measure 1 produced the result 34 at time 
0001000201090200010501000BEBC200 GMT, while Measure 2 produced the value 
54 10ms later at time 0001000201090200010501000E4E1C00 GMT, and that 
both rows are updated on several later occasions such that the current 
values are 37 and 53 respectively.  
 
Then the following resultCounts instances would exist: 
 
   resultCounts.1.0001000201090200010501000BEBC200 34 
   resultCounts.2.0001000201090200010501000E4E1C00 54

4.1.4. Report definition 
    
   A report consists of sending or logging a subset of results of 
   measure. The elaboration of the report consists of actions to perform 
   on the measurement results. An action is performed either: 
    
     + For each result 
     + On the results corresponding to a measurement cycle 
     + On the results available at the measurement completion.  
    
   To preserve the scalability of the whole measurement system, it 
   limits: 
    
     + The amount of data sent to the applications 
     + The bandwidth consumption for uploading the result 
     + The number of alarms sent to the applications 
     + The amount of data saved in the point of measure 
         
    
   The comparison of the measure results in a metric threshold that 
   identifies particular measure values and times that directly impact 
   service availability. 
    
   The comparison of the duration of repeated events with a duration 
   threshold identifies particular measure values and times that 
   directly affect an SLA.

Internet Draft             IPPM reporting MIB                  June 2002 
                                     
                                     
   The combination of IPPM metric results, threshold events, and event 
   filtering provides a very efficient mechanism to report results, 
   events, and alarms. 
    
   A report is described using the TEXTUAL-CONVENTION 
   IppmReportDefinition. The report setup must not dramatically increase 
   the amount of data needed by the control protocol to setup a measure: 
    
          +  A basic report is defined in the object 
          ippmReportSetupDefinition; 
          +  More elaborate reports are described using a metric 
          threshold to generate alarms and events.  
          +  Pushing of alarms and reports requires an NMS address. 
          +  SLA alarms are described using an events duration 
          threshold. 
         
   The TEXTUAL-CONVENTION IppmReportDefinition specifies the list of 
   events and actions that are used to create a report. 
    
4.1.5. IppmStandardMetrics 
    
   The TEXTUAL-CONVENTION IppmStandardMetrics defines the standardized 
   IPPM metrics. 
 
4.2. Structure of the MIB 
    
   The MIB is arranged as follow: 
                         
        - ippmOwnersGroup                
         
        - ippmSystemGroup                
         
        - ippmMeasureGroup       
                 
        - ippmHistoryGroup               
         
        - ippmNetworkMeasureGroup                
         
        - ippmAggregatedMeasureGroup     
         
        - ippmReportGroup        
         
        - ippmNotifications      
    
    
    
4.2.1. The ippmOwners Group  
    
       This group controls access to the probe.

Internet Draft             IPPM reporting MIB                  June 2002 
                                     
                                     
4.2.2. The ippmSystem Group 
    
   This group consists of a set of parameters describing the clock 
   synchronization over the time. 
    
   This group is Critical to the implementation of the IPPM MIB.  
    
   Section 6.3. of the IPPM Framework states that 
   "Those who develop such measurement methodologies should strive to: 
     +    Minimize their uncertainties/errors, 
     +    Understand and document the sources of uncertainty/error, and 
     +    Quantify the amounts of uncertainty/error." 
    
   The aim of this group is to have these values available to compute 
   reliable statistics. The implementation of this group is mandatory 
   whether the time synchronization is automatic or not. 
    
4.2.3. The ippmMeasureGroup 
    
   This group displays all the measures configured on the measurement 
   entity. It consists of the ippmMetricsTable, ippmMeasureTable. 
    
   The measurement entity describes in the ippmMetricsTable of the SNMP 
   agent the local implementation of the standardized metrics. 
    
   The control protocol registers a description of the existing measures 
   in the ippmMeasureTable and in the auxiliary measure tables.  
    
   ippmMeasureTable holds the common part of a measure, while the 
   specific parameters are handled in the corresponding auxiliary table 
   (ippmNetworkMeasure, ippmAggregatedMeasureTableà) . 
    
   The results of the measures are logged in the ippmHistoryTable. 
 
4.2.4. The ippmNetworkMeasure Group  
    
   The control protocol registers a description of the existing network 
   measures in the ippmNetworkMeasureTable and in the ippmMeasureTable. 
    
   This group displays the network measures defined by the control 
   protocol. The results are saved in the ippmHistoryTable.  
    
   ippmNetworkMeasureTable is an auxiliary table of ippmMeasureTable, 
   and is responsible for the configuration of the network measure. 
 
4.2.5. The ippmAggregatedMeasure Group  
 
   ippmAggregatedMeasureTable is an auxiliary table of ippmMeasureTable, 
   and is responsible for the consolidation of the results previously 
   measured and saved in the ippmHistoryTable. The aggregated results

   are saved in the ippmHistoryTable and may be used for higher 
   aggregated measures.  
    
4.2.6. The report Group  
 
   This group displays the existing reports of the measures. 
   ippmReportSetupTable is an auxiliary table of ippmMeasureTable, and 
   is responsible for the configuration of the reports. 
   The reports are saved in the ippmReportTable, or sent directly to the 
   applications.  
 
4.2.7. The notification Group  
 
   The Notification group specifies a list of valid notifications. They 
   are used to push alarms or reports to the applications. 
 
4.3. Row identification in an application namespace 
    
   The control protocol or the test protocol adds rows in the namespace 
   of the corresponding measure. 
    
   An identifier of an instance of an object is defined as a list of 
   objects in the clause INDEX. An identifier of an instance of an 
   object in an owner namespace is defined as a list of objects in the 
   clause INDEX where the first object type is OwnerString. 
    
   As the OBJECT IDENTIFIER, which identifies the instance, begins with 
   the owner value, the remaining value of the index fields may be 
   chosen independently from one namespace to another. 
    
   This allows the user to choose arbitrary values for the remaining 
   fields of the INDEX clause without checking that the values of these 
   fields exist in the MIB tables. This allows the owner to use the same 
   values across MIB implementations. 
 
   Thus, it avoids polling to determine the next free index. Also, as a 
   consequence, s 2 applications will never find the same free index 
   value. 
    
   The usage of owner namespace increases the speed of the management 
   operations while reducing bandwidth consumption and CPU load in the 
   agents and applications. 
    
   Measurements are requested by NMS applications. An instance of an 
   object managed by an NMS is identified by the NMS OwnerString and the 
   private index provided by the NMS. 
 
   As the NMS manages its private range of indices, it simply chooses 
   one when it wishes to create a new control entry. For the same 
   reason, the setup of a measure on several points of measures consists

Internet Draft             IPPM reporting MIB                  June 2002 
                                     
                                     
 
    
5.2. Conceptual programming interface 
    
   This section describes a conceptual programming interface for the 
   integration of the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB in a point of measure. 
    
5.2.1. Measure control 
    
   A measure is created/deleted/suspended through the ControlMeasure() 
   call.  
    
5.2.2. Result log 
    
   A result of a measure is created in the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB History 
   table using a CreateResult() call. Results belonging to a measure are 
   managed according to the setup of the measure. 
    
5.2.3. Reporting 
    
   Results are reported using the method GetResult(), 
   GetMeasureMetricResults() and GetMeasureResults() respectively to get 
   a singleton result, the singleton result of a metric measure,  and 
   finally to get the singleton result of a measure.                     
    
5.2.4. Logical calls 
                         
   Objects are managed using 5 main primitives:    
       
        controlMeasure(); 
        CreateResult(); 
        GetResult(); 
        GetMeasureMetricResults(); 
        GetMeasureResults(). 
    
5.3. SNMP mapping 
    
   ControlMeasure() corresponds to a SNMP set-request on a conceptual 
   row of ippmMeasureEntry and on a conceptual row of  
   ippmNetworkMeasureEntry. 
    
   CreateResult() is a internal interface for adding measure results in 
   the ippmHistoryTable. 
    
   GetResult() corresponds to an SNMP get-request on a result. 
    
   GetMeasureMetricResults() corresponds to a SNMP walk on the results 
   of a metric measure subtree. 
    
   GetMeasureResults() corresponds to a SNMP walk on the results of a 
   measure subtree.

6. Measurement architectures 
    
   There are four main measurement architectures. 
 
6.1. Proxy architecture

                   +----------+     +----------+

                     +--------------------------+ 
                              ^     ^ 
                              |     | 
                            OWDP-Control 
                              |     | 
                   +----------+     +----------+ 
                   |                           |         
                   v                           v 
        +----------------+              +------------------+ 
        | Packets-Sender |--OWDP-Test-->| Packets-Receiver | 
        +----------------+              +------------------+ 
       
   In this architecture, the different NMSÆs query the IPPM-REPORTING-
   MIB agent for measurements. The agent controls whether the NMS is 
   granted access to perform the measure requested. Each NMS accesses 
   the results of its measurements in the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB statistics 
   table. 
    
   The measurement setup/teardown and the data collection are done using 
   the control protocol and the test protocol. 
 
   In this mode the NMS does not depend either on the control protocol 
   nor on the test protocol. The entities involved in the measurement do 
   not need to implement the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB nor SNMP. This mode 
   allows for lightweight implementation in the point of measure, and 
   also for heterogeneous control protocols to coexist. 
    
   Finally, the proxy is a checkpoint where measurement activity may be 
   logged, and where access to measurement setups may be tightly

   controlled. Thus, it provides a reliable architecture to manage the 
   security of a measurement system. 
    
 
6.2. Reporting architecture 
    
   In this architecture the SNMP protocol is only used to read the 
   results of the measurements in the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB History Table, 
   and also to inform the NMS that an event has occurred.

The activation of a measure by the control protocol or the test protocol 
creates a measure in the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB Measure table. The table in 
question may be not accessible by SNMP. In this case, a list of the 
measure identifiers (owner, index) is handled by the measurement 
software. 
 
Each timestamped result of the measure is logged on the fly in the IPPM-
REPORTING-MIB History table in order to allow read access to the NMSÆs 
and event handling.

On completion, the measurement results are managed according to the 
measure setup: 
          + The results may be sent to an NMS using a SNMP Trap PDU or 
          a SNMP Inform PDU. The NMS may be the sender entity or the 
          control entity; 
          + They may be dropped from the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB History 
          table. 
         
In this mode, it is recommended to use an SNMPv2 Inform PDU to send the 
result because it ensures that the entire block of the result is 
received. There is no control using SNMP Trap PDU.     
 
Also, in this mode, it is recommended to implement the IPPM-REPORTING-
MIB Measure table in read only in order to allow an NMS to read the 
status of their measures.

The NMS measurement queries are registered in the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB 
scheduler and performed by the control and the test protocol. The NMS 
directly consults the result in the corresponding points of measure. 
 
6.4. Security 
    
The proxy mode provides flexibility and control of the access to the 
points of measure, while allowing lightweight control protocol and test 
protocol implementations in the points of measure. Different security 
rules may be applied to the NMS domain and to measurement system 
domains. 
 
The reporting mode has 2 security domains:

Internet Draft             IPPM reporting MIB                  June 2002 
                                     
                                     
  +The control of the measurement setups relies on the control and the 
  test protocol security mechanisms.  
  + The control of access to the results depends on the SNMP security 
  mechanisms. 
 
The gateway mode security relies on the security of the proxy mode and 
of the reporting mode. 
    
7. Reporting mode integration with the control and test protocols 
    
The IPPM-REPORTING-MIB standardizes the parameters that: 
 
          + Define the configuration of the IPPM metrics measures; 
          + Define the format of the results of the measure; 
          + Define the report of the IPPM metric measures results. 
         
It introduces the concept of owner namespace to allow for fast 
configuration and reporting across multiple points of measurement.  
    
A measure is a distributed object describing a task to be performed by 
the control and the test protocols. A measure is identified by its owner 
and its owner index. This identifier is the same in all the points of 
measure. As the owner chooses the index, there is no need for 
negotiation between the NMS and the points of measure before activating 
the measure. 
 
A measure is primarily defined by its identifier, the metrics to 
measure, the description of the end point addresses and the description 
of the scheduling of the measure. 
 
 
 
The description of the measure is distributed to the points of measure 
involved. The distribution may not be synchronized. 
 
7.1. Integration  
 
The control protocol, test protocol and the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB share the 
same semantic. 
 
The integration of the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB, and the test and control 
protocols, relies on the use of the conceptual programming interface 
described in section 6. It consists in pushing the measure 
setup/teardown parameters and the result values from the measurement 
software to the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB agent. 
 
7.2. Setup of the measure  
    
The creation of the measure consists only in transferring the measure 
description from the measurement software to the MIB. The management of 
the measure is done using the ControlMeasure().

Internet Draft             IPPM reporting MIB                  June 2002 
                                     
                                     
 
The protocol, which provides the parameters of the measure to manage, 
may be the control protocol of the test protocol. 
 
Different frameworks may be used to setup a measure.  
    
7.2.1. Synchronous setup 
 
The control protocol sets up the measure both in the sender and the 
receiver before the measurement. 
 
7.2.2. Asynchronous setup 
 
The control protocol sets up the measure only in the sender. In this 
case, the receiver has a service already activated (or pending )for the 
typeP of the measurement.  
 
As the first test packet includes the description of the measure, it may 
differ from regular test packets. If the first test packet is not 
consistent with the regular test packets, it must not be used for 
performing metrics measurement. 
 
7.3. Setup of the measurement report 
    
The report description is an extension to the definition of a measure. 
It describes the event and the data to include in the report. A report 
is read by an NMS in the ippmReportTable, or pushed to a NMS using a 
SNMP Trap PDU, a SNMP Inform PDU, an email, or a SMS. 
 
The control protocol, or the test protocol, includes the description of 
the report in the setup of the measure.  
 
Different types of reports may be combined: 
 
          + A trivial report defines the results to be saved in the 
          ippmReportTable; 
          + A basic report defines the host to which the results are 
          pushed on completion of the measure; 
          + An alarm report defines a threshold on the results of the 
          measure. A message is sent to a host when the result raises 
          or fall the threshold; 
          + An SLA report defines a threshold on the results of the 
          measure. The events are filtered using a staircase method. 
          The report consists in the results of the measure (time and 
          value) of the filtered events. The reports are sent at each 
          measure cycle or when the measure completes. 
 
7.4. Writing the measurement results in the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB  
 
Results have to be written by the measurement task in the agent 
implementing the IPPM MIB.

Adding the results of a measurement consists in the transfer of the 
result from the measurement software to the agent. The protocol that 
provides the result may be the control protocol, or the test protocol.  
 
Writing a result is done using the CreateResult(). 
    
7.5. Report download and upload 
    
A report is read in the ippmReportTable using SNMP, or pushed by the 
IPPM_MIB agent using a SNMP Trap PDU, a SNMP Inform PDU, an email or a 
SMS. 
 
7.6. Default value 
    
   The default values correspond to Ipv4 best effort.

                the value of the SYNTAX clause for the type of the Src 
                and Dst of an IPPM measure. The RFC2895 specifies a 
                macro for the definition of protocol identifiers while 
                its companion document, the RFC2896 defines a set of

                Notes: An IPPM TypeP does not differ from RMON2 Protocol 
                identifiers, but TypeP usage in IPPM MIB differs from 
                Protocol identifier usage in RMON2. A IPPM measure is 
                active, so generally TypeP does not describe the link 
                layer (i.e. ether2...). Valid Internet packets are sent

                from Src to Dst. Then the choice of the link layer

   DESCRIPTION 
        "IppmReportDefinition is intended to be used for describing the 
   report resulting from a measurement. By default, all the results of a 
   measure belong to the report of this measure. 
         
        The first step of the report definition sets up triggers on the 
   value of the measure, and on the distribution over time of the events 
   generated by these triggers.  
         
        The resulting measures corresponding to an event are reported 
   periodically, or sent in alarms as soon as the event occurs.

                notification ippmCycleOfMeasureReport 
                + A report of a complete measure is sent using the 
                notification ippmCompletedMeasureReport 
                 
        Example 1: 
        The setup of an alarm to be sent to the owner in a SNMP Trap 
   each time the staircase crosses the metric threshold value of 5: 
    
                ippmReportSetupMetricThreshold 5

                } 
    
        Example 2: 
        The setup of a report to be sent to the owner in a SNMP 
   informRequestPDU per measure cycle. It reports the staircase values 
   corresponding to a metric threshold of 5: 
    
                ippmReportSetupMetricThreshold 5 
                ippmReportSetupDefinition {

9. Security Considerations 
    
9.1. Privacy 
    
   The privacy concerns of network measurement are intrinsically limited 
   by the active measurements. Unlike passive measurements, there can be 
   no release of existing user data. 
    
    
9.2. Measurement aspects 
    
   Conducting Internet measurements raises both security and privacy 
   concerns. This memo does not specify an implementation of the 
   metrics, so it does not directly affect the security of the Internet 
   nor of applications that run on the Internet. However, 
   implementations of these metrics must be mindful of security and 
   privacy concerns. 
     
    There are two types of security concerns: potential harm caused by 
   the measurements, and potential harm to the measurements. The 
   measurements could cause harm because they are active, and inject 
   packets into the network. The measurement parameters MUST be 
   carefully selected so that the measurements inject trivial amounts of 
   additional traffic into the networks they measure. If they inject 
   "too much" traffic, they can skew the results of the measurement, and 
   in extreme cases cause congestion and denial of service. 
     
    The measurements themselves could be harmed by routers giving 
   measurement traffic a different priority than "normal" traffic, or by 
   an attacker injecting artificial measurement traffic. If routers can 
   recognize measurement traffic and treat it separately, the 
   measurements will not reflect actual user traffic. If an attacker 
   injects artificial traffic that is accepted as legitimate, the loss 
   rate will be artificially lowered. Therefore, the measurement 
   methodologies SHOULD include appropriate techniques to reduce the 
   probability measurement traffic can be distinguished from "normal" 
   traffic.  
    
   Authentication techniques, such as digital signatures, may be used 
   where appropriate to guard against injected traffic attacks. 
     
 
9.3. Management aspects 
    
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that 
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-only. Such objects 
   may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
   environments. The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
   network operations.

    SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the network 
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no 
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and 
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.  
     
    It is recommended that the implementors consider the security 
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically, the use 
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [18] and the View-based 
   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [21] is recommended.  
     
    It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP 
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly 
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals 
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET 
   (change/create/delete) them.
