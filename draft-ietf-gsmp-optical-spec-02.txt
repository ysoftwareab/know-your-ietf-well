   1. Introduction 
      
     This document describes the extended functions and their mechanisms 
     of the General Switch Management Protocol version 3 (GSMPv3) for the 
     support of optical switching. GSMPv3 is an asymmetric protocol to 
     control and manage label switch. The label switches that are used for

     optical switching are all optical cross-connects (optical-optical-
     optical), transparent optical cross connects (optical-electrical-
     optical, frame independent), and opaque optical cross connects 
     (optical-electrical-optical, SONET/SDH frames).These optical cross 
     connect (OXC) systems can be IP-based optical routers which are 
     dynamic wavelength routers, optical label switches, or burst/packet-
     based optical cross connects [2]. In this draft, we do not limit 
     specific OXC systems, but aim to provide the general functions of 
     optical switching and services for connections in general optical 
     switches.  
      
     GSMPv3 is a label switch controller and provides a control interface 
     to optical switches. The optical resources used in connection setup 
     are different from those used in legacy networks. In optical 
     switching, basic connection units are a fiber, a wavelength, or a 
     burst and they are assumed to be processed in optical domain without 
     optical/electrical/optical conversion. This specification defines the 
     services, traffic control, and QoS guarantee necessary at to support 
     optical switches. This draft defines several sub-TLVs, parameters, 
     and new messages to support optical services and optical connection 
     management. This draft describes optical resources, connection 
     management, optical services, and switch configuration which can be 
     applied in optical domain generally. 
       
     One of the important OAM functions is protection and restoration 
     function. In the current situation where a single fiber delivers 
     several Tb/s through several wavelengths, when even a single link 
     gets cut it makes a huge turbulence. Therefore GSMPv3, as an optical 
     switch controller, MUST have survivable capability of switches and 
     connections. By extending the management messages of GSMPv3, this 
     function will be implemented.  
        
     [Note] For the complete implementation this document MUST be referred 
     with [1].  
      
      
      
   2. GSMP Packet Encapsulation 
      
     GSMP Packets may be transported via any suitable medium. GSMP packet 
     encapsulation for optical support will be defined in separate 
     documents.  
      
      
      
   3. Common Definitions and Procedures for Optical Support. 
    
   3.1 Labels 
      
     Labels are the basic identifiers for connections. In order to setup 
     connections in optical switch, new labels MUST be defined. Newly 
     defined labels identify entities that are to be switched in optical

     switches. Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) defines 
     packet switching capable (PSC), Time-Division Multiplex Capable (TDM), 
     lambda switching capable (LSC), fiber switching capable (FSC) 
     interfaces, and it introduces needs of generalized labels to support 
     them [3][4]. The following list is the labels to be supported in 
     GSMPv3 for optical support [2][3][4][7][8][10].      
      
        - a single fiber in a bundle 
        - a single waveband within a waveband (or )fiber 
        - a single wavelength within a fiber 
        - an optical burst within a wavelength  
      
     All labels are encoded in a common structure composed of three fields, 
     a Type, a Length, and a Value [1]. A label TLV is encoded as a 2-
     octet field that uses 12 bits to specify a Type and four bits to 
     specify certain behavior specified below, followed by 2-octec Length 
     field, and followed by a variable length Value field.  
      
     A summary of TLV labels supported by the GSMPv3 extensions for 
     optical support defined in this document is listed below: 
       
     TLV Label                        Label Type 
     --------------------             ----------- 
     Fiber Label                      0x300 
     Waveband Label                   0x301 
     Wavelength Label                 0x302      
     Optical burst Label              0x303  
      
     All labels will be designated as follow: 
      
         0                   1                   2                   3

     A 16-bit field indicating the length of the Label Value field in 
     bytes. 
      
     Label value: Variable 
     A variable length field that is an integer number of 32 bit words 
     long. The interpretation of this field depends on the Label Type as 
     described in the following sections.  
      
      
   3.1.1 Labels for Fiber  
      
     This label indicates a fiber to be used for a connection 
     establishment in optical switching. The label value only has 
     significance between two neighbors, and the receiver MAY need to 
     convert the received value into a value that has local significance.  
      
     If the label type = labels for fiber, the label MUST be interpreted 
     as labels for fiber and it has the following format: 
      
         0                   1                   2                   3

        |                             Label                             | 
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      
     Label: 32 bits 
     Indicates a label for fiber to be used.  
      
      
   3.1.2 Labels for Waveband  
      
     A waveband is a set of contiguous wavelengths which can be switched 
     together to a new waveband [3][4]. It MAY be desirable for an optical 
     cross connect to optically switch multiple wavelengths as a unit 
     since it MAY reduce distortion on individual wavelengths and MAY 
     allow tighter separation of individual wavelengths. Waveband 
     switching introduces another level of label hierarchy and as such the 
     waveband is treated the same way all other upper layer labels are 
     treated. The waveband label is defined to support such a waveband 
     switching. The waveband label can be encoded in three parts; waveband 
     ID, start label, and end label. The start label and the end label 
     represent the lowest value of wavelength and the highest value of 
     wavelength.  
      
     If the label type = labels for waveband, the label MUST be 
     interpreted as labels for waveband and it has the following format: 
      
         0                   1                   2                   3 
         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      
     Waveband Id: 32 bits 
     A waveband identifier. The value is selected by a sender and reused 
     in all subsequent related messages. 
      
     Start Label: 32 bits 
     Indicates the lowest value of wavelength in the waveband. 
      
     End Label: 32 bits 
     Indicates the highest value wavelength in the waveband. 
      
     The start/end label are established either by configuration or by  
     means of a protocol such as LMP [6]. They are normally used in the   
     label parameter of the Generalized Label one PSC and LSC [3][4]. 
      
      
   3.1.3 Labels for Wavelength  
      
     The label indicates a single wavelength to be used for a connection 
     establishment in optical switching. The label value only has 
     significance between two neighbors, and the receiver MAY need to 
     convert the received value into a value that has local significance.  
      
     If the label type = labels for wavelength, the label MUST be 
     interpreted as labels for wavelength and a format of the label for 
     wavelength is given as the below: 
      
         0                   1                   2                   3

        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
        |                             Label                             | 
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      
     Label: 32 bits 
     Indicates label for wavelength to be used.  
      
      
   3.1.4 Labels for optical burst 
      
     The label for optical burst represents a label for switching data 
     burst in optical domain.  
      
     Optical data burst switching, which utilizes finer granularity in 
     time domain in a coarse granularity such as a wavelength, is a new 
     connection entity in optical domain [7][8]. Connection setup for 
     optical burst includes reserving time on the transport medium for the 
     client.  
      
    
    
   Choi, et. al.        Expires - December 2003                   [Page 6] 

   GSMPv3 for Optical Support                                    June 2003 
    
     This time is characterized by two parameters: start time and duration 
     of data burst. These values define a fast one-way reservation. Upon a 
     request for a connection setup for data burst, the GSMP controller 
     MUST perform appropriate Connection Admission Control for the start 
     time and duration of data burst specified. If the connection is 
     allowed, it MUST signal these parameters to the burst switching 
     device to reserve the exact bandwidth required [7][8]. The burst 
     switch MUST perform switching operation autonomously, using 
     synchronization methods prescribed for the burst network it is 
     operating in.  
      
     If the label type = labels for optical burst, the label MUST be 
     interpreted as labels for burst switching and a format of the label 
     for optical burst is given as the below: 
      
         0                   1                   2                   3

        |                             Label                             | 
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      
     Label: 32 bits 
     Indicates label for a burst level connection.  
      
      
      
   4. Connection Management Messages 
      
     Connection management messages, which are used for establishing, 
     releasing, modifying, and verifying connections across the switch by 
     the controller, SHOULD operate for optical switching. Connection 
     management messages also SHOULD support recovery capabilities of 
     optical switch and these are mainly dealt with in the following sub-
     sections. 
      
     The general message definition and semantics in this section follow 
     [1] and the other untouched items are dealt with in it. 
       
      
   4.1 Add Branch Message: Recovery Specific Block 
      
     Recovery capability of optical switch is supported by Add Branch 
     message by establishing recovery connection in order to protect 
     working connection. By using this message a recovery connection is 
     established for various types of recovery mechanism. The recovery 
     block defines a recovery type, connection type, and related 
     connection information for the purpose of recovery. 
      
     The Add Branch message adds the following block for recovery 
     capability. 
       
          0                   1                   2                   3

     Reservable resources are bandwidth, buffers, queues, labels and etc. 
     In this draft the resources imply optical resources, such as data 
     burst, wavelengths, fibers, and so on. In this section, recovery 
     capability and data burst level switching are supported by using the 
     Reservation Management messages.  
      
      
   5.1 Reservation Request Message: Recovery Specific Block 
      
     Reservation Request message is used to reserve a recovery connection 
     for various types of recovery mechanisms. Especially, in 1:N (M:N) 
     shared recovery scheme, a spare connection is reserved for N working 
     connections. In order to support recovery capability, a recovery 
     connection is configured by reserving backup resource for working 
     connections. The GSMPv3 controller SHOULD have mapping information 
     between a shared backup resource and N working connections. Whenever 
     the GSMPv3 uses the reserved resource for a failed working connection, 
     Add Branch message is used to establish a new connection with New 
     Port/Label of one of N working connections.  
      
     Reservation Request message adds the following block for recovery 
     capability.

   5.2 Reservation Request Message: Optical Burst Specific Block 
      
     Reservation Request message also supports a new connection per data 
     burst in optical domain. Data burst is very short in huge bandwidth 
     of a wavelength and needs to process just in time. However, it takes 
     much time to reserve resource and setup a connection per data burst 
     by using the Reservation Request message. Therefore, a short form of 
     Reservation Request message is used to support data burst. The

     original Reservation Request message tries to reserve resource for 
     data burst and the short form of the message is used to trigger the 
     resource to switch and transmit the data burst. This message only 
     contains information to identify the reservation as well as the 
     original message. In order to configure a connection per burst, two 
     parameters, offset time and burst length, are added on the message. 
     When a controller receives a request for a connection setup for data 
     burst it sends the message. According to the different switching 
     mechanisms for optical burst [7][8], the value of two fields in the 
     message are assigned. That is, by applying them, connection setup and 
     release are performed explicitly or implicitly. This draft does not 
     limit the usage of the block in a specific switching technology.  
     The following message is the short form of Reservation Request 
     message to support data burst.

     Configuration or the All Ports Configuration message, can be 
     specified to the range of label supported by a specified port and to

     be changed by using Label Range message. Since the granularity of 
     each connection is different in optical domain each port SHOULD allow 
     the label range changeable in ports. In addition, a port MAY have 
     wavelength converters with full or limited capability so that each 
     port MAY have different limited labels. In case of waveband switching, 
     a single label for waveband connection is used for a set of 
     wavelengths in the band. To support these cases, the Label Range 
     message is used.  
      
     The general usage and the format of this message follows [1]. 
      
      
   6.1.1 Optical Label 
      
     If the Label Type is equal to optical label, the label range message 
     MUST be interpreted as shown:

   7. Statistics Messages: Optical Signal Specific Block 
      
     The statistics messages are used to query the performance statistics 
     related to ports and connections for optical transmission. The 
     statistics contain optical transmission characteristics which specify 
     transmission quality of connections. Transmission performance is 
     typically defined in terms of signal performance with reference to 
     noise level, or by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and spectral 
     occupancy requirement or signal power level. Optical Signal 
     Statistics message SHOULD contain Optical Signal Block which 
     specifies the transmission property of connections as shown in the 
     below.

     This field implies quality of transmission signal in a connection so 
     that it informs a controller signal degradation or loss of signal. 
     This field MAY consist of several blocks which specify the optical 
     signal statistics in detail and they will be further added on this 
     message. This information MAY result in an alarm of link failure. 
      
      
      
   8. Configuration Messages 
      
     The configuration messages allow a controller to discover  
     capabilities of optical switch. Switch configuration, port 
     configuration, and service configuration messages are defined for 
     these functions.  
      
      
   8.1 Switch Configuration Message: Optical Switch Specific Block 
      
     Since an optical switch MAY be able to provide connection services at 
     multiple transport layers, and not all switches are expected to 
     support the same transport layers, the switch will need to notify the 
     controller of the specific layers it can support. Therefore, the 
     switch configuration message MUST be extended to provide a list of 
     the transport layers for which an optical switch can perform 
     switching. For supporting various types of switching capable 
     interfaces, the following optical switch configuration blocks SHOULD 
     be added in the Switch Configuration message.  
      
          0                   1                   2                   3

     Switching Capable Layer : 8 bits 
     This field indicates the supported switching capable layers in an 
     optical switch. It has three flags which indicate the layers. The 
     flags can be set at the same time when the optical switch contains 
     multiple transport layers.

     L: indicates the switching capable layer per a wavelength 
      
      
   8.2 Port Configuration Message 
      
     The port configuration message informs a controller configuration 
     information related to a single port. Ports in optical switches 
     differ from those in electrical switches. The ports defined in GSMPv3 
     imply a single physical link and several connections are specified 
     with labels in a port. However, a single port does not identify a 
     single link in optical domain. A port can imply a set of fibers, a 
     single fiber, or a single wavelength. Therefore different types of 
     port SHOULD be identified in GSMPv3.  
      
     The basic format and usage of Port Configuration message follow [1]. 
     The following new port types are defined to support optical switch. 
      
        Value                PortType 
        ------               --------- 
        10                   a fiber (wavelength) 
      
     When the value of PortType is in the above range, we call "PortType = 
     Optical Switching" in the following section.  
      
   8.2.1 PortType Specific Data for Optical Switching 
      
     The format and usage of Port Specific Data in Port Configuration 
     message depends on the PortType value and the basic format of it is 
     given as following [1].

     (interface) in; 
      
        Bits/sec       for PortType = Optical Switching

     The maximum rate of data that may depart from the output port 
     (interface) in; 
      
        Bits/sec       for PortType = Optical Switching 
      
     Port Status 
     Give the administrative state of the port. The new values of the Port 
     Status are defined to indicate recovery capability in port. 
      
        Recovery: 
        Port Status = 6. The port is reserved for recovery support. For 
        1+1 dedicated protection, this port is configured to transmit 
        traffic as a backup. On the other hand, for 1:1 protection, this 
        port is just configured to reserve the connection without 
        transmitting traffic.   
      
     Line Type 
     The type of physical transmission interface for this port. The line 
     type for optical support depends on switching interface for each 
     switching entity, such as for wavelength-related port or fiber-
     related port. This field MAY define range of wavelength, fiber type, 
     and so on. For example,

     The physical location of the slot in optical switching (or OXC). 
     Since the OXC systems can have many bays which contain hundreds of 
     shelf which have tens of thousands of port this field SHLOULD 
     identify the slot. For doing so, the field MAY be partitioned into 
     several sub-fields to define bay, shelf, and slot.

     Carries label information. The interpretation of this field depends 
     on the type of the link (or the type of connection) over which the

     available optical labels. Each encoding type of the labels is TBD. 
      
      
      
   9. Event Messages 
      
     The Event messages allow a switch to inform a controller of certain 
     asynchronous events. This draft deals with recovery-related events. 
     The indication of these asynchronous events related to ports and 
     labels can inform failure of them to the controller and it can 
     initiate a fault recovery mechanism. In the following sub-sections, 
     two messages, Recovery Completion message and Fault Notification 
     message, are used to notify a controller fault-related events of a 
     switch.

     This field implies the total number of the recovery-related blocks. 
     By notifying the contents of the recovery-related blocks in a single 
     event message to the controller the recovery-related events can be 
     processed in very short time. The number of Blocks in a single Event 
     message for recovery-related events MUST NOT cause the packet length 
     to exceed toe maximum transmission unit defined by the encapsulation.  
      
     Recovery-Related Blocks 
     This field contains several recovery-related blocks for the suitable 
     purpose of the messages. In this draft, these fields are used to 
     notify recovery completion or fault notification. More message 
     specific contents are dealt with in the following sub-sections. 
      
      
   9.1 Recovery Completion Message 
      
     This message is used to notify the recovery completion to the 
     controller by the switch after the failed elements are restored. This 
     message contains restored connection information. Restored Connection 
     information implies restored Port IDs and Label IDs. By using this 
     message, the recovery completion of several failed connections, which 
     consist of port and label, are notified to the controller at one time.

   10. Service Model Definition 
      
     In the GSMP Service Model a controller may request the switch to 
     establish a connection with a given Service. The requested Service is 
     identified by including a Service ID in the Add Branch message or the 
     Reservation message. The Service ID refers to a Service Definition 
     (defined in chapter 10 of [1]). This chapter defines the various 
     Service ID for optical capable switches. 
      
     The following Service Identifiers are defined for optical support. 
      
     ID Range              Service Type 
     --------              ------------ 
     128 - 191             Optical Switch Services

     A definition of the QoS Parameters that are included in the 
     Capability Set for instances of the Service. 
      
     Traffic Controls 
     A definition of the Traffic Controls that may be supported by an 
     instance of the Service. 
      
      
      
   11. Failure Response Codes 
      
     This chapter describes the failure and warning states which can occur 
     in setup optical connections. The following lists are the codes that 
     SHOULD be defined and added in the Failure Response messages. These 
     codes MAY be added more when the services for optical switching are 
     defined.  
      
     If the switch issues a failure response it MUST choose the most 
     specific failure code according to the following precedence. The code 
     numbers will be assigned in IANA.

         Due the limitation of available resource for recovery connection, 
         for example, multiple links failure, the switch can not be

         In case of delayed reservation in time is not exactly matched, 
         the reservation of optical burst can be failed.  
      
     The following list gives a summary of the failure codes defined for 
     failure response messages: 
      
     - no available label for shortage of available wavelengths 
     - no available resource for recovery  
     - no available resource for waveband connection setup 
     - no match for the delayed reservation for optical burst connection 
      
      
      
   12. Security Considerations 
      
     This document does not have any security concerns. The security 
     requirements using this document are described in the referenced 
     documents. 
    
    
    
   Appendix I. Protection and Restoration Capability in GSMPv3 
      
     The GSMP controller MUST support the protection and restoration 
     capabilities because the optical switch delivers several Gbps data 
     traffic in a single wavelength. To achieve fast protection and 
     restoration, the optical switch MAY be capable of taking an action 
     independent of the GSMP controller, then it informs the controller 
     after completing the restoration [2]. This differs from the master-
     slave relationship in GSMP.  
      
     Recovery mechanisms do not distinguish path (end-to-end) and link 
     recovery in GSMPv3. The difference of them is considered in signaling 
     protocol. In case of dynamically calculating the recovery connection 
     after a fault occurs, GSMPv3 establishes a new recovery connection by 
     using the existing Add Branch message. Therefore, this draft 
     considers pre-planned recovery mechanisms, such as 1+1 dedicated 
     recovery, 1:1 dedicated recovery with/without extra traffic, and 
     1:N/M:N shared recovery.  
      
     The label switch SHOULD provide the protection and restoration 
     capabilities in order to provide the recovery mechanisms. For example, 
    
    
   Choi, et. al.        Expires - December 2003                   [Page 19]

     an ingress/egress node reserves backup resources according the each 
     recovery mechanism, and setup the switch fabric. Then, GSMPv3 is used 
     to control the switch.  
      
     In this section, the recovery mechanisms which can be provided by 
     GSMPv3 are specified with an included  fault notification, and 
     restoration, and related required messages. For example, the port 
     configuration command MUST be extended to allow autonomous protection 
     mechanism. The current GSMP connection management also MUST be 
     extended to support this function. In the following subsections, the 
     supported recovery mechanisms in GSMPv3 are introduced. 
      
      
   1.1 1+1 dedicated recovery mechanism 
      
      
     - Recovery connection configuration 
     All nodes on a working connection use Add Branch message(P) to 
     configure a recovery connection. The ingress node transmits traffic 
     through the working connection as well as the recovery connection. An 
     egress only chooses traffic from the working connection with ignoring 
     them from the recovery connection. In order to support this type of 
     recovery mechanism, the optical switch SHOULD support it physically. 
      
     - Recovery procedure 
     When a failure occurs, a fault-affected working connection is 
     switched over a 1+1 dedicated recovery connection without notifying 
     the controller. The recovery process is performed at the physical 
     layer automatically. After the recovery is completed, the switch 
     notifies the recovery completion to the controller by using Event 
     message.  
      
      
   1.2 1:1 dedicated recovery mechanism 
      
     1) 1:1 protection  
      
     - Recovery connection configuration 
     All nodes on a working connection configure a recovery connection by 
     using Add Branch message. However, the ingress node does not transmit 
     any traffic through the reserved recovery connection since the switch 
     does not cross connect for the recovery connection.  
      
     - Recovery procedure 
     When an ingress node detects a fault it switches over the fault-
     affected working connection to the reserved recovery connection. This 
     type of recovery does not require configuring additional connection 
     configuration because the recovery connection has been already 
     established by using Add Branch message(P). Then, an egress node 
     switches over the recovery connection to receive traffic.

     2) 1:1 restoration  
      
     - Recovery connection configuration 
     An ingress node and an egress node both configure a recovery 
     connection by using the Reservation Request message(P), and core 
     nodes also use it to reserve recovery connection. Extra traffic can 
     be delivered through the recovery connection.  
      
     - Recovery procedure 
     The ingress node and the egress node use Add Branch message in order 
     to configure a recovery connection. Other core nodes also configure 
     the recovery connection with Add Branch message(P) with the reserved 
     resource.  
      
      
   1.3 1:N/M:N shared recovery mechanism (M, N > 1, M <= N) 
      
     - Recovery connection configuration 
     Reservation Request message(P) is used to configure a recovery 
     connection. Since several working connections (= N) share one 
     recovery connection (1:N) or several recovery connections (M:N) 
     GSMPv3 SHUOLD know the sharing  working connection IDs for the 
     recovery connections.  
      
     - Recovery procedure 
     When the GSMPv3 controller is notified a fault, it uses Add Branch 
     message(P) to configure a new working connection by using reserved 
     recovery connection. The Add Branch message(P) SHOULD contain the 
     information about the reserved recovery connection. 
      
      
    
   Appendix II. GSMPv3 support for optical cross-connect systems 
      
     The GSMPv3 controls and manages the optical cross-connect systems as 
     label switches. The optical cross-connect (OXC) is a space division 
     switch that can switch an optical data stream on an input port to an 
     output port. The OXCs are all optical cross-connects (optical-
     optical-optical), transparent optical cross connects (optical-
     electrical-optical, frame independent), and opaque optical cross 
     connects (optical-electrical-optical, SONET/SDH frames).These OXC 
     (optical cross connect) systems can be IP-based optical routers which 
     are dynamic wavelength routers, optical label switches, or 
     burst/packet-based optical cross connects, and so on[2]. 
      
     The OXC system consists of switching fabric, multiplexer/ 
     demultiplexer, wavelength converter, and optical-electrical/ 
     electrical-optical converter. Multiple wavelengths are multiplexed or 
     demultiplexed into a fiber. Multiple fibers belong to a fiber bundle. 
     A wavelength, a waveband, and a fiber can be used to establish a 
     connection in an optical switch. They SHOULD be recognized at a port 
     in the OXC since they are connection entities. When the OXC has

     transparent OXC. Wavelength converter SHOULD be used to resolve 
     output port contention when two different connections try to be 
     established in a same output port. Since the wavelength converter can 
     work only within a limited operating range, the limited numbers of 
     wavelengths are used at the output port. It limits the available 
     wavelengths at the output port.  
      
     If OXCs perform protection and restoration functions they SHOULD have 
     suitable switch structure to support them. In case of 1+1 dedicated 
     recovery, input ports and output ports MUST be duplicated in a switch. 
     The switch transmits optical signal through two ports (one for 
     working connection and another for recovery connection) 
     simultaneously. When a fault happens the switch switches over from 
     failed working connection to dedicated recovery connection without 
     noticing a controller.
