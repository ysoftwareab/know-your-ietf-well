   Balanced Linked Adaptation Congestion Control Algorithm for MPTCP
                draft-walid-mptcp-congestion-control-04

Abstract

   This document describes the mechanism of Balia, the "Balanced linked
   adaptation", which is a congestion control algorithm for Multipath
   TCP (MPTCP).  The recent proposals, LIA and OLIA, suffer from either
   unfriendliness to Single Path TCP (SPTCP) or unresponsiveness to
   network changes under certain conditions.  The tradeoff between
   friendliness and responsiveness is inevitable, but Balia judiciously
   balances this tradeoff based on a new design framework that allows
   one to systematically explore the design space.  Balia has been
   implemented in the Linux kernel and also included in the UCLouvain's
   MPTCP implementation.

1.  Introduction

   Various congestion control algorithms have been proposed as
   extensions of TCP NewReno to MPTCP.  A straightforward extension is
   to run TCP NewReno on each subpath, e.g., [HONDA09].  This algorithm,
   however, can be highly unfriendly when it shares a path with a SPTCP
   user.  This motivates the Coupled algorithm which is fair because it
   has the same underlying utility function as TCP NewReno, e.g.,
   [KELLY05], [HAN04].  It is found in [RFC6356], however, that the
   Coupled algorithm responds slowly in a dynamic network environment.

   The current default congestion control algorithm for MPTCP, called
   LIA (Linked-Increases Algorithm), is more responsive than the Coupled
   algorithm.  However, it has been reported that LIA can sometimes be
   excessively aggressive toward SPTCP users without any benefit to

   multipath users [KHALILI12].  Recently, OLIA (Opportunistic Linked-
   Increases Algorithm) [KHALILI12] was proposed as a variant of Coupled
   algorithm [KELLY05] which is as friendly as the Coupled algorithm.
   We have found, however, that OLIA can be unresponsive to changes in
   network conditions in some scenarios (e.g., when the paths used by a
   user have similar round trip times (RTTs)) [PENG14].

   In this draft, we introduce Balia, the "Balanced linked adaptation",
   which is a window-based congestion control algorithm for MPTCP.  The
   main design goal of Balia is to systematically tradeoff different
   properties such as TCP friendliness and responsiveness by developing
   structural understanding of MPTCP algorithms in a new design
   framework.  For instance, it is widely suspected that there is a
   tradeoff between friendliness and responsiveness and it is proved in
   this framework that this tradeoff is indeed inevitable.  By
   parameterizing different structural properties, Balia generalizes
   existing algorithms and explicitly balances the tradeoff.  We also
   prove mathematically that Balia has a unique equilibrium point, and
   that it is asymptotically stable.  Therefore, Balia can provide
   balanced performance in terms of friendliness and responsiveness.

   In [PENG14], we compare the performance of several MPTCP algorithms
   over a testbed, including Balia, OLIA and LIA.  Our experimental
   results show that Balia is friendlier than LIA and more responsive
   than OLIA.  It also solves LIA's problem identified by [KHALILI12].
   Balia has been implemented in the Linux kernel and also included in
   the UCLouvain's MPTCP implementation.

   AIMD: The Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease algorithm used in
   TCP congestion avoidance.

   w_r: The congestion window on a path r.

   rtt_r: The Round-Trip Time (RTT) on a path r.

2.  Balanced Linked Adaptation Algorithm

   Balia is a generalized MPTCP algorithm that strikes a good balance
   between friendliness and responsiveness.  The algorithm only applies
   to the AIMD part of the congestion avoidance phase.  The other parts
   such as slow start, fast retransmit/recovery algorithms are the same
   as in TCP [RFC5681].  The minimum ssthresh is set to 1 MSS instead of
   2 when more than 1 path is available.

   Each source s has a set of paths r.  As a special case, the set can
   be a singleton in which case Balia reduces to TCP Reno (see below).
   Each path r maintains a congestion window w_r and measures its round-
   trip time rtt_r.  The window adaptation of Balia is as follows:

   - For each ACK on path r, increase w_r by:

                    x_r             1 + alpha_r       4 + alpha_r
           -------------------- * ( ----------- ) * ( ----------- )
           rtt_r * (SUM(x_k))^2          2                 5

   - For each packet loss on path r, decrease w_r by:

            w_r
           -----  *  min { alpha_r,  1.5 }
             2

   where x_r = w_r / rtt_r and alpha_r = max { x_k } / x_r.

   Note that Balia's decrement algorithm multiplies the MD algorithm of
   TCP Reno by a factor in the range of [1, 1.5].

   If a Balia user uses only a single path, then alpha_r = 1, in which
   case both the increment and the decrement algorithms of Balia reduce
   to those of TCP Reno.  Hence Balia reduces to TCP Reno on single
   paths.

3.  Theoretical justification

   In [PENG14], we have developed a unified model of MPTCP algorithms
   and characterized the design space.  This provides a framework to
   systematically design MPTCP algorithms and analyze their behavior in

   a large network at design time.  For instance, it has allowed us to
   identify designs that guarantee the existence, uniqueness and
   stability of network equilibrium.  Balia is designed using this
   framework to achieve specific design goals.  In this section, we will
   focus on how Balia balances three often conflicting design goals, TCP
   friendliness, responsiveness and window oscillation.

   TCP friendliness characterizes how much more throughput a MPTCP flow
   will get when it competes with an SPTCP flow.  A MPTCP flow is said
   to be "TCP friendly" if it does not dominate the available bandwidth
   when it shares the same network with a SPTCP flow.

   Responsiveness characterizes how fast the MPTCP algorithm reacts to
   changes in network conditions.

   The window oscillation property characterizes how severely the window
   size fluctuates around the equilibrium point.  It is an inherent
   property of AIMD-like algorithms.

   In [PENG14], it is proved mathematically that there is an inevitable
   tradeoff between TCP friendliness and responsiveness, and between
   responsiveness and window oscillation.  Thus, it is theoretically
   impossible to maximize the performance in all three metrics
   simultaneously.

   Our design philosophy is to allow window oscillation up to an
   acceptable level in order to improve both friendliness and
   responsiveness.  This is achieved by explicitly parameterizing these
   properties and systematically choosing these parameters.

4.  Implementation considerations

   To enable Balia to operate in a wide spectrum of applications
   scenarios, i.e., with wide range of w_r and rtt_r, we need to re-
   write the Balia's additive increase (AI) formula in an equivalent
   form which allows easier implementation in the Linux kernel with
   fixed point operations, and avoids integer-overflow problems.  Note
   that in an extreme case, the sending rate on a path, x_r, may
   increase to 2^30 (w_r/rtt_r) or more.  In such a case, the term
   (SUM(x_k))^2 in the current formula can easily cause 64-bit integer
   overflow.  In addition, there can be also a significant rounding
   error when we do a fixed-point division by a large number.

   Therefore, to mitigate the above issues, we rewrite Balia's additive
   increase (AI) formula as follows:






Walid, et al.             Expires July 26, 2016                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft          MPTCP Congestion Control            January 2016


              x_r             x_r + max{x_k}       4 * x_r + max{x_k}
     -------------------- * ( -------------- ) * ( ------------------ )
     rtt_r * (SUM(x_k))^2        2 * x_r                5 * x_r

   which can be simplified to:

     (x_r + max{x_k}) * (4 * x_r + max{x_k})
     ---------------------------------------
            w_r * (SUM(x_k))^2 * 10

   Now the term x_r is computed in bytes/sec and may increase up to
   about 2^52.  Thus we need to scale the sending rate through bit-shift
   operations so that max{x_k} does not exceed a cerntain value, e.g.,
   2^25, to safely calculate the term (SUM(x_k))^2.  At this point, if
   max{x_k} is a very large number, a small x_r can be sometimes 0 after
   the right shift operation.  This may hurt the accuracy of the
   calculation.  But we have seen that the overall rounding error is not
   significant since max{x_k} is the dominant term in the formula while
   x_r would be neglible in such cases.

5.  Experimental results

   In this section, we summarize our experimental results that
   illustrate the weaknesses of the current algorithms (LIA and OLIA).
   We evaluate the MPTCP algorithms using the UCLouvain's MPTCP
   implementation [MPLKI].  The network parameters such as network
   bandwidth and one-way delay are implemented by Dummynet [DUMMYNET].
   Iperf is used to generate traffic and measure the throughput.

5.1.  Khalili's scenario

   In [KHALILI12], it has been revealed that LIA can be unfriendly to
   SPTCP users even when its own MPTCP throughput is saturated.  That
   is, the throughputs of SPTCP flows are significantly degraded without
   any benefit to MPTCP flows.  To reproduce this scenario, we create a
   testbed as shown in Figure 1.  In this scenario, N1 type1 users can
   be either single-path or multipath while N2 type2 users are always
   single-path.

   The aggregate throughputs of these users are shown in Table 1 for the
   case when all users are SPTCP and the case when all type1 users are
   upgraded to MPTCP users using different algorithms.  We observe that
   upgrading type1 users to MPTCP decreases type2 users' throughput
   without any benefit to type1 users if LIA is used; the type2 users
   are worse off by 19% when N1=N2=5 and by 25% when N1=15 and N2=5.
   Both OLIA and Balia are more friendly than LIA to SPTCP (type2)
   users.

5.2.  Responsiveness

   To demonstrate the dynamic performance of MPTCP algorithms, we
   implement a testbed topology as shown in Figure 2.  One-way delay of
   each single-path is about 10ms.  In this scenario, a MPTCP flow is
   long lived while 5 SPTCP flows start at 40s and end at 80s.  Table 2
   shows the convergence time, which is defined as the first time the
   congestion window on the second path via Router2 reaches the average
   congestion window after the SPTCP users have left.

   Values are in seconds.

   Table 2: Responsiveness: Convergence time of MPTCP user after SPTCP
   users have left the network.

   We observe that in this scenario Balia and LIA are quite responsive
   while both Coupled and OLIA algorithms take an excessively long time
   to recover.  Note that in this scenario, the increment/decrement
   algorithms of Coupled and those of OLIA are similar, and therefore
   they behave in a similar way.  For both algorithms, the excessively
   slow recovery of the congestion window on the second path is due to
   the design that increases the window roughly by w_r / (SUM(w_k))^2 on
   each ACK assuming the RTTs are similar.  After the SPTCP users have
   left, w_2 is small while w_1 is large, so that w_2 / (w_1 + w_2)^2 is
   very small.  It therefore takes a long time for w_2 to increase to
   its steady state value.  In general, under the Coupled algorithm, a
   route with a large throughput can greatly suppress the throughput on
   another route even though the other route is underutilized.

5.3.  NorNet experiment

   To show that Balia works well on real Internet environments, we
   create two virtual machine hosts A and B over the NorNet Core, a
   country-wide (Norway) multi-homed research testbed [NORNET].  Host A
   is connected to Internet via ISP(Internet service provider)-1 while
   host B is connected via ISP-2 and ISP-3.

   Considering a scenario where host B downloads a file from host A via
   two interfaces, we measure the througputs of both SPTCP and MPTCP
   with Reno and Balia respectively, as shown in Table 3.  There are two
   logical paths between the hosts, (ISP-1 to ISP-2) and (ISP-1 to ISP-
   3), so we measure the bandwidth of each single-path with SPTCP and
   both of the two paths with MPTCP.  The measurement is repeated 30
   times for each case.  In Table 3, it is observed that MPTCP with
   Balia aggregates the bandwidths of the two paths well.

6.  Conclusion

   In [PENG14], we have developed a model for MPTCP and identified
   designs that guarantee the existence, uniqueness and stability of the
   network equilibrium.  We also characterize the design space and study
   the tradeoff among TCP friendliness, responsiveness, and window
   oscillation.  Base on better understanding of the design space, our
   new congestion control algorithm for MPTCP, Balia, generalizes prior
   algorithms and strikes a good balance between friendliness and
   responsiveness.  Balia has been implemented in the Linux kernel and
   tested in various scenarios.
