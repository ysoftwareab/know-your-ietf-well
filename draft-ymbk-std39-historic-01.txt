0. Abstract

   STD 39 [STD39], "Specification for the Interconnection of a Host and
   an IMP" describes technology which is no longer used.  This documents
   requests that STD 39 be moved to historic status.

1. Details

   During a review of internet standards, it was brought to the
   attention of the IESG that the ARPANET Host-IMP protocol, was still
   listed as an Internet Standard, STD 39.  Since this protocol has not
   been in use in the public internet for well over a decade, the IESG
   proposes to reclassify it to historic.
