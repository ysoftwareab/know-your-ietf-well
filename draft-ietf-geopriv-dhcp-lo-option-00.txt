1.0 Introduction

This document specifies a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol [1] Option 
for the geographic location of the client, to be provided by the server. 

The DHCP server is assumed to have determined the location from the 
Circuit-ID Relay Agent Information Option (RAIO) defined (as SubOpt 1) in 
[2]. In order to translate the circuit (switch port identifier) into a 
location, the DHCP server is assumed to have access to a service that maps 
from circuit-ID to the location at which the circuit connected to that 
port terminates in the building; for example, the location of the wall 
jack.


The Location Object (LO) format presented here could be considered a 
subset of a larger GEOPRIV LO. Achieving a core set of LO elements is 
desired across multiple Protocols which can convey location information. 

An important feature of this document is it places the LO completely under 
control of the end device rather than storing the object in an outside 
service for retrieval by the end device. Storage outside the end device 
during times of emergency can cause unnecessary delay, or failure during 
communication.

Another important feature of the LO is its inclusion of a resolution 
parameter for each of the dimensions of location. The GEOPRIV working 
group has a stated requirement [3] to enable decreasing the precision of a 
location element. Because this resolution parameter need not apply to all 
dimensions equally, a resolution value is included for each of the 3 
location elements. GEOPRIV actually calls their requirement: Accuracy. We 


Polk/Schnizlein/Linsner                                             Page 2

Internet Draft       DHCP Option for Geographic Location    Jan 17th, 2002

use the term and meaning "Resolution" as being more precise for the intent 
here. 

When comparing the resolution method described here with other methods to 
express geo-location accuracy, the result of this resolution method 
describes a region (normally trapezoidal) rather than the possible (error) 
distance from the indicated location.  There is good reason not to 
describe geo-location accuracy as a potential error in distance from the 
latitude, longitude, and altitude values.  

The error distance method describes a circular area with a center point. 
If this method were used for a LO and the end device wanted to 'hide' from 
the center point, it would need to recalculate a location from the stated 
center point that remains in the stated circle. This recalculation could 
be problematic for the end device depending on that deviceÆs geo-location 
computing framework. By using the resolution method described here, the 
end device could simply express a lesser resolution value to provide a 
less precise location. Or, the end device may or may not need to be 
involved with the resolution policy at all, as this could be dictated by 
another entity, perhaps that device's domain, simply by providing the end 
device with a location with the resolution of the desired value.

This resolution method provides a natural ability for the device to hide 
from the center point of the bounding area as this resolution method is 
determined via the inherent affects of binary mathematics, using the power 
of 2.  

The resulting LO using this resolution method is a small fixed length 
object that can be easily stored in memory and be easily appended within 
other protocols with little regards to packet size as the LO is only 15 
bytes long.

Finally, in the appendix this document provides some arithmetic examples 
of just how the imprecision can be introduced in any or all of the 
La/Lo/Alt values without the IP device needing to be preprogrammed with 
bogus LOs, and just how imprecise the La/Lo/Alt values can be. 

This document does not cover any policy regarding the potential use of 
this other than a few as potential suggestions to convey the meaning 
intended by the document.

1.2 Motivation

As applications such as IP Telephony are replacing conventional telephony, 
users are expecting the same (or greater) level of services with the new 
technology.  One service offered by conventional telephony that is 
missing, in any standardized fashion, within IP Telephony is for a user to 
be automatically located by emergency responders, in a timely fashion, 
when the user summons help (by dialing 911 in North America, for example). 
Unless strict administrative rules are followed, the mobility of a wired 
Ethernet device within a campus negates any opportunity for an emergency 
responder to locate the device with any degree of expediency.  Users do 
not want to give up the mobility IP Telephony offers.  Informing the host 
device of its geo-location at host configuration time will allow the 
device to utilize this geo-location information to inform others of it's 
current geo-location, if the user and/or application so desires.

The goal of this option is to enable a wired Ethernet host to provide its 
location to an emergency responder, as one example. 

Wireless hosts can utilize this option to gain knowledge of the location 
of the radio access point used during host configuration, but will need 
some more exotic mechanisms, maybe GPS, or maybe a future DHCP option, 
which includes a list of geo-loc objects like that defined here, which has 
the locations of the radio access points that are close to the client. 


1.3 Rationale

Within the LO described here, Latitude and Longitude are represented in 
fixed-point 2s-complement binary degrees, for the economy of a smaller 
option size compared to the string encoding of digits in [5].  The integer 
parts of these fields are 9 bits long to accommodate +/- 180 degrees. The 
fractional part is 25 bits long, better than the precision of 7 decimal 
digits. Each parameter is 40 bits total, in length.

Altitude is represented in measurement units (MU) indicated by the MU 
field, which is 4 bits long. Two measurement units are defined here, 
meters (code=1) and floors (code=2), both of which are 2s-complement 
fixed-point with 8 bits of fraction. Additional measurement units MAY be 
assigned by IANA. The floor of a building is often the relevant location 
information, and not necessarily computable from meters of altitude. 

Each of these 3 variables is preceded by an accuracy sub-field of 6 bits, 
indicating the number of bits of resolution. This resolution sub-field 
accommodates the GEOPRIV requirement [3] to easily adjust the precision of 
a reported location. Contents beyond the claimed resolution MAY be 
randomized to obscure greater precision that might be available.

2.0 DHC Location Object Elements 

DHCP is a binary Protocol; GEOPRIV is text-based. Most coordinate systems 
translate fairly easily between binary-based and text-based location 
output (i.e. even emergency services within the US). The authors believe 
translation/conversion is a non-issue with DHCP's binary format. 

This binary format provides a fortunate benefit in a mechanism for making 
a true/correct location coordinate imprecise. It further provides the 
capability to have this binary representation be deterministically 
imprecise.


The proposed LO format is:

      0                   1                   2                   3

2.1 Elements of the Location Object

   Code TBD: The code for this DHCP option is TBD by IANA.

   15:       The length of this option is 15 bytes.

   LaRes:    Latitude resolution. 6 bits indicating the valid number of 
             valid bits in the fixed-point value of Latitude. 

This value is a length of the (left to right) number of Latitude bits that 
should be considered valid. Any bits entered to the right of this limit 
should not be considered valid and might be purposely false, or zeroed by 
the sending device (meaning the GEOPRIV target towards the requestor).

The examples below in section 4.0, are to illustrate that a smaller value 
in the resolution field increases the area within which the device is 
located (without deception). 

Values of resolution above decimal 34 are currently Undefined and reserved 
because that is the largest number of bits in the Latitude variable.



Polk/Schnizlein/Linsner                                             Page 5

Internet Draft       DHCP Option for Geographic Location    Jan 17th, 2002

   Latitude: a 34 bit fixed point value consisting of 9 bits of integer 
             and 25 bits of fraction. Latitude SHOULD be normalized to 
             within +/- 90 degrees. Geo-location formats provide for 
             positive numbers to be north of the equator and negative 
             numbers to be south of the equator. 

A value of 2 in the LaRes field indicates a precision of no greater than 
1/6th that of the globe (detailed in the first example in section 4.0). A 
value of 34 in the LaRes field indicates a precision within 3.11 mm in 
Latitude.

   LoRes:    Longitude resolution. 6 bits indicating the number of valid 
             bits in the fixed-point value of Longitude. 
             
This value is a length value of the (left to right) number of Longitude 
bits that should be considered valid. Any bits entered to the right of 
this limit should not be considered valid and might be purposely false, or 
zeroed by the sending device (meaning the GEOPRIV target towards the 
requestor).

             Values above decimal 34 are currently undefined and reserved.

   Longitude:   a 34 bit fixed point value consisting of 9 bits of integer 
             and 25 bits of fraction. Longitude SHOULD be normalized to 
             within +/- 180 degrees. Geo-location formats provide for 
             positive numbers to be east of the prime meridian and 
             negative numbers to be west of the prime meridian. 

Entering a value of 2 in the LoRes field will result in the precision of 
no greater than 1/6th that of the globe (see first example in section 4.0 
for more here). A value of 34 in the LoRes field indicates a precision 
within 2.42 mm in longitude (at the equator). Because lines of longitude 
converge at the poles, the distance is smaller (resolution greater) for 
locations away from the equator.

   AltRes:   Altitude resolution. 6 bits indicating the number of valid 
             bits in the altitude. Values above 30 decimal are undefined 
             and reserved.

   MU: Measurement unit for altitude. Codes defined here are:

     1: Meters - in 2s-complement fixed-point 22-bit integer part with 
                 8-bit fraction

If MU = 1, then a completely imprecise Altitude would be of AltRes value 
0. If the Altitude is known exactly, then the AltRes can be value 30 (or 
all ones).

     2: Floors - in 2s-complement fixed-point 22-bit integer part with 
                 8-bit fraction



Polk/Schnizlein/Linsner                                             Page 6

Internet Draft       DHCP Option for Geographic Location    Jan 17th, 2002

MU = 2 for Floors was chosen because of the impreciseness of the number of 
meters any one floor is above/below the ground floor, or above mean low 
tide (the Altitude datum within WGS84). What is fairly understood is which 
If MU=2, AltRes = 30, and Altitude = 0, that represents the ground 
regardless if there is a building present or not (as well as the ground 
floor of a building). This is important because the precise altitude might 
not be known, but it is likely known what is the ground level. The non-
obvious case is in a hilly or mountainous area, these values still 
represent being on the ground level at the La/Lo coordinates provided. 


3.0 Purpose of Resolution Value per La/Lo/Alt Element

GEOPRIV specified [3] the requirement that any location expressed from or 
proxied on behalf of a device through the GEOPRIV Protocol can have the 
accuracy or precision of that device's location limited. The owner of the 
device, or the domain of the device determines the policy for divulging 
how precise the location is for any/all given requesters of that device's 
location. 

One aspect within the GEOPRIV WG is the precision of a device's ability to 
present its location coordinates might have a domain policy override the 
individual policy in the sense of maximum resolution possible. In other 
words, a user of a device might not mind providing a quite precise 
location return to a location request, but the local domain might not want 
that level of precision by its policy. In this case, the resolution value 
provided in the DHCP Reply can set this maximum precision value, perhaps 
allowing the user of the Target device to make the values more imprecise 
based on who is requesting their location. The document does not go 
further down this thought for good reason.


4.0 Security Considerations

Where critical decisions might be based on the value of this GeoLoc 
option, DHCP authentication in [7] SHOULD be used to protect the integrity 
of the DHCP options.


5.0 IANA Considerations

The DHCP option code for the GeoLoc option is TBD.

Appendix: Calculations of Imprecision possible with the DHC LO

The following examples for two different locations demonstrate how the 
Resolution values for Latitude, Longitude and Altitude can be used. 

A.1 Location Object of "White House" (Example 1)

The address was NOT picked for any political reason and can easily be 
found on the Internet or mapping software, but was picked as an easily 
identifiable location on our planet.

Postal Address:
  White House
  1600 Pennsylvania Ave. NW
  Washington, DC 20006

Standing on the sidewalk, north side of White House, between driveways.

Latitude 38.89868 degrees North (or +38.89868 degrees)
   Using 2s complement, 34 bit fixed point, 25 bit fraction 
   Latitude = 0x04dcc1fc8, Latitude = 0001001101110011000001111111001000

Longitude 77.03723 degrees West (or û77.03723 degrees)
   Using 2s complement, 34 bit fixed point, 25 bit fraction 
   Longitude = 0xf65ecf031, Longitude = 1101100101111011001111000000110001

Altitude 15

  In this example we are not inside a structure, therefore we will 
  assume an altitude value of 15 meters, interpolated from the US 
  Geological survey map, Washington West quadrangle.

    AltRes = 30, 0x1e, 011110
    MU = 1, 0x01, 000001
    Altitude = 15, 0x0F00, 00000000000000000000000001111100000000

If: LaRes is expressed as value 2 (0x02 or 000010) and LoRes is 
    expressed as value 2 (0x02 or 000010), then it would describe 
    a geo-location region that is north of the equator and extends from 
    û1 degree (west of the meridian) to û128 degrees.  This would 
    include the area from approximately 600km south of Saltpond, Ghana, 
    due north to the North Pole and approximately 4400km south-
    southwest of Los Angeles, CA due north to the North Pole.  This 
    would cover an area of about one-sixth of the globe, approximately 
    20 million square nautical miles (nm).

If: LaRes is expressed as value 3 (0x03 or 000011) and LoRes is 
    expressed as value 3, (0x03 or 000011) then it would describe 
    a geo-location area that is north from the equator to 63 degrees 
    north, and -65 degrees to û128 degrees longitude.  This area 
    includes south of a line from Anchorage, AL to eastern Nunavut, CN. 
    and from the Amazons of northern Brazil to approximately 4400km 
    south-southwest of Los Angeles, CA.  This area would include North 
    America, Central America, and parts of Venezuela and Columbia, 
    except portions of Alaska and northern and eastern Canada, 
    approximately 10 million square nm.

If: LaRes is expressed as value 5 (0x05 or 000101) and LoRes is 
    expressed as value 5 (0x05 or 000101), then it would describe 
    a geo-location area that is latitude 32 north of the equator to 
    latitude 48 and extends from û64 degrees to û80 degrees longitude. 
    This is approximately an east-west boundary of a time zone, an area 


Polk/Schnizlein/Linsner                                             Page 9

    of approximately 700,000 square nm.

If: LaRes is expressed as value 9 (0x09 or 001001) and LoRes is 
    expressed as value 9 (0x09 or 001001), which includes all the 
    integer bits, then it would describe a geo-location area that 
    is latitude 38 north of the equator to latitude 39 and extends from 
    û77 degrees to û78 degrees longitude.  This is an area of 
    approximately 9600 square km (111.3km x 86.5km).

If: LaRes is expressed as value 18 (0x12 or 010010) and LoRes is 
    expressed as value 18 (0x12 or 010010), then it would describe 
    a geo-location area that is latitude 38.8984375 north to latitude 
    38.9003906 and extends from û77.0390625 degrees to û77.0371094 
    degrees longitude.  This is an area of approximately 36,600 square 
    meters (169m x 217m).

If: LaRes is expressed as value 22 (0x16 or 010110) and LoRes is 
    expressed as value 22 (0x16 or 010110), then it would describe a 
    geo-location area that is latitude 38.896816 north to latitude 
    38.8985596 and extends from û77.0372314 degrees to û77.0371094 
    degrees longitude.  This is an area of approximately 143 square 
    meters (10.5m x 13.6m).

If: LaRes is expressed as value 28 (0x1c or 011100) and LoRes is 
    expressed as value 28 (0x1c or 011100), then it would describe a 
    geo-location area that is latitude 38.8986797 north to latitude 
    38.8986816 and extends from û77.0372314 degrees to û77.0372296 
    degrees longitude.  This is an area of approximately 339 square 
    centimeters (20.9cm x 16.23cm).

If: LaRes is expressed as value 30 (0x1e or 011110) and LoRes is 
    expressed as value 30 (0x1e or 011110), then it would describe a 
    geo-location area that is latitude 38.8986797 north to latitude 
    38.8986802 and extends from û77.0372300 degrees to û77.0372296 
    degrees longitude.  This is an area of approximately 19.5 square 
    centimeters (50mm x 39mm).

If: LaRes is expressed as value 34 (0x22 or 100010) and LoRes is 
    expressed as value 34 (0x22 or 100010), then it would describe a 
    geo-location area that is latitude 38.8986800 north to latitude 
    38.8986802 and extends from û77.0372300 degrees to û77.0372296 
    degrees longitude.  This is an area of approximately 7.5 square 
    millimeters (3.11mm x 2.42mm).

In the (White House) example, the requirement of emergency responders in 
North America via their NENA Model Legislation [6], could be met by a 
LaRes value of 21 and a LoRes value of 20.  This would yield a geo-
location that is latitude 38.8984375 north to latitude 38.8988616 north 
and longitude û77.0371094 to longitude û77.0375977.  This is an area of 
approximately 89 feet by 75 feet or 6669 square feet, which is very close 
to the 7000 square feet asked for by NENA.  In this example a service

provider could enforce that a device send a Location Object with this 
minimum amount of resolution for this particular location when calling 
emergency services.


A.2 Location Object of "Sears Tower" (Example 2)

Postal Address:
Sears Tower
103th Floor
233 S. Wacker Dr.
Chicago, IL  60606

Viewing the Chicago area from the Observation Deck of the Sears Tower.

Latitude 41.87884 degrees North (or +41.87884 degrees)
   Using 2s complement, 34 bit fixed point, 25 bit fraction 
   Latitude = 0x053c1f751, Latitude = 0001010011110000011111011101010001

Longitude 87.63602 degrees West (or û87.63602 degrees)
   Using 2s complement, 34 bit fixed point, 25 bit fraction 
   Longitude = 0xf50ba5b97, Longitude = 1101010000101110100101101110010111

Altitude 103

  In this example we are inside a structure, therefore we will assume an 
  altitude value of 103 to indicate the floor we are on.  The measurement 
  unit value is 2 indicating floors.  The AltRes field would indicate that 
  all bits in the Altitude field are true, as we want to accurately 
  represent the floor of the structure where we are located.

    AltRes = 30, 0x1e, 011110
    MU = 2, 0x02, 000010
    Altitude = 103, 0x00006700, 000000000000000110011100000000

For the accuracy of the latitude and longitude, the best information 
available to us was supplied by a generic mapping service that shows a 
single geo-loc for all of the Sears Tower.  Therefore we are going to show 
LaRes as value 18 (0x12 or 010010) and LoRes as value 18 (0x12 or 010010).  
This would be describing a geo-location area that is latitude 41.8769531 
to latitude 41.8789062 and extends from û87.6367188 degrees to û87.6347657 
degrees longitude.  This is an area of approximately 373412 square feet 
(713.3 ft. x 523.5 ft.).
