Abstract 

This memo conveys simplistically the likely topological scenarios that may 
be encountered in reference to IEPREP phone calls.  These scenarios should 
be used to focus the IEPREP Working Group during discussions and when 
writing requirements, gap analysis and other solutions documents.

1.0	Introduction

This memo conveys simplistically the likely topological scenarios that may 
be encountered in reference to IEPREP phone calls.  These scenarios should 
be used to focus the IEPREP Working Group during discussions and when 
writing requirements, gap analysis and other solutions documents.

There has been much confusion on the IEPREP list as well as within each 
meeting about the topologies IEPREP is considering. Hopefully this 
document will give each reader and author a reference set of named 
architectures.

This memo attempts to be agnostic with regard to IP signaling or control 
protocols (SIP, MEGACO, etc), as well as any underlying QOS mechanisms 
(Diffserv, RSVP, NSIS, etc).


1.1 Motivation

Simply put, to get everyone referencing the same (named) topologies in 
order to have useful and less confusing dialog to further this working
group's efforts.


1.2 Changes From Previous Versions 

Changes from -00 to -01

This version greatly reduces the text of the overall document by removing 
all discussion of requirements and authentication & authorization. This is

Internet Draft        draft-polk-ieprep-scenarios-02.txt     Dec 3rd, 2002



not a requirements document (therefore shouldn't state any), and the A&A 
text/discussion for each of the topologies, though necessary within the WG, 
has been moved to another "ieprep-topology-implications" document.

Changes from -01 to -02

Cleaned up minor omissions discovered that weren't omitted from the -00 to 
-01 change.

Took out the paragraph following Figure 2 (section 2.2) referring to where 
ETS aware devices should be.


1.3 Terms and Definitions

The following acronyms need to be exploded for clarity:

      CSN = Circuit Switched Network

      GW  = Gateway (CSN to IP, or IP to CSN)



2.0 IEPREP Topologies

There are 4 often mentioned, but very little documented topologies 
discussed within this WG's efforts so far. The following subsections name 
and describe each of the topologies. 

The 4 topologies are (quickly):

     Topology "IP Bridging"

     Topology "IP at the Start"

     Topology "IP at the End"

     Topology "End-to-End IP"



2.1 Topology "IP Bridging"

This topology is sometimes known as "IP in the Middle" of two CSNs. In 
this topology, a CSN phone of any type initiates (dials) a call to another
CSN phone with an IP core between the two CSNs.

This topology should simplistically look like this:

2.2 Topology "IP at the Start"

This topology has the initiating party placing (dialing) the call from an 
IP Phone (PDA or computer), and the called party residing in the CSN.

2.3 Topology "IP at the End"

This topology has the calling party placing the call from a CSN phone, and 
the called party being in an IP network.

2.4 Topology "End-to-End IP"

This topology has no circuit switched sections in the call path.

3.0 Security Considerations

This document merely suggests a common naming convention within IEPREP WG 
discussions, therefore there are no special security considerations.


4.0 IANA Considerations

There are no IANA considerations within this document
