Abstract 

   This document describes how to use Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) 
   public-key algorithms in the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS).  The 
   ECC algorithms support the creation of digital signatures and the 
   exchange of keys to encrypt or authenticate content.  The definition 
   of the algorithm processing is based on the NIST FIPS 186-3 for 
   digital signature, NIST SP800-56A and SEC1 for key agreement, RFC 
   3370 and RFC 3565 for key wrap and content encryption, NIST FIPS 180-
   3 for message digest, SEC1 for key derivation, and RFC 2104 and RFC 
   4231 for message authentication code standards.  This document 
   obsoletes RFC 3278.

1. Introduction 

   The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) is cryptographic algorithm 
   independent.  This specification defines a profile for the use of 
   Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) public key algorithms in the CMS.  
   The ECC algorithms are incorporated into the following CMS content 
   types: 

     -  'SignedData' to support ECC-based digital signature methods 
        (ECDSA) to sign content; 

     -  'EnvelopedData' to support ECC-based public-key agreement 
        methods (ECDH and ECMQV) to generate pairwise key-encryption 
        keys to encrypt content-encryption keys used for content 
        encryption; 

     -  'AuthenticatedData' to support ECC-based public-key agreement 
        methods (ECMQV) to generate pairwise key-encryption keys to 
        encrypt message-authentication keys used for content 
        authentication and integrity; and, 

     -  'AuthEnvelopedData' to support ECC-based public-key agreement 
        methods (ECMQV) to generate pairwise key-encryption keys to 
        encrypt message-authentication and content-encryption keys used 
        for content authentication, integrity, and encryption.

   Certification of EC public keys is also described to provide public-
   key distribution in support of the specified techniques. 

   The document will obsolete [CMS-ECC].  The technical changes 
   performed since RFC 3278 are detailed in Appendix B. 

1.1. Requirements Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [MUST]. 

2. SignedData using ECC 

   This section describes how to use ECC algorithms with the CMS 
   SignedData format to sign data. 

2.1. SignedData using ECDSA 

   This section describes how to use the Elliptic Curve Digital 
   Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) with SignedData.  ECDSA is specified in 
   [FIPS186-3].  The method is the elliptic curve analog of the Digital 
   Signature Algorithm (DSA) [FIPS186-3]. ECDSA is used with the Secure 
   Hash Algorithm (SHA) [FIPS180-3]. 

   In an implementation that uses ECDSA with CMS SignedData, the 
   following techniques and formats MUST be used. 

2.1.1. Fields of the SignedData 

   When using ECDSA with SignedData, the fields of SignerInfo are as in 
   [CMS], but with the following restrictions: 

     - digestAlgorithm MUST contain the algorithm identifier of the hash 
       algorithm (see Section 7.1.1) which MUST be one of the 
       following: id-sha1, id-sha224, id-sha256, id-sha384, or id-
       sha512. 

     - signatureAlgorithm contains the signature algorithm identifier 
       (see Section 7.1.3): ecdsa-with-SHA1, ecdsa-with-SHA224, ecdsa-
       with-SHA256, ecdsa-with-SHA384, or ecdsa-with-SHA512. The hash 
       algorithm identified in the name of the signature algorithm MUST 
       be the same as the digestAlgorithm (e.g., digestAlgorithm is id-
       sha256 therefore signatureAlgorithm is ecdsa-with-SHA256).

Internet-Draft        Use of ECC Algorithms in CMS            June 2008 
    

     - signature MUST contain the DER encoding (as an octet string) of a 
       value of the ASN.1 type ECDSA-Sig-Value (see Section 7.2).  

   When using ECDSA, the SignedData certificates field MAY include the 
   certificate(s) for the EC public key(s) used in the generation of the 
   ECDSA signatures in SignedData.  ECC certificates are discussed in 
   Section 5. 

2.1.2. Actions of the sending agent 

   When using ECDSA with SignedData, the sending agent uses the message 
   digest calculation process and signature generation process for 
   SignedData that are specified in [CMS].  To sign data, the sending 
   agent uses the signature method specified in [FIPS186-3]. 

   The sending agent encodes the resulting signature using the  
   ECDSA-Sig-Value syntax (see Section 7.2) and places it in the 
   SignerInfo signature field. 

2.1.3. Actions of the receiving agent 

   When using ECDSA with SignedData, the receiving agent uses the 
   message digest calculation process and signature verification process 
   for SignedData that are specified in [CMS].  To verify SignedData, 
   the receiving agent uses the signature verification method specified 
   in [FIPS186-3]. 

   In order to verify the signature, the receiving agent retrieves the 
   integers r and s from the SignerInfo signature field of the received 
   message. 

3. EnvelopedData using ECC Algorithms 

   This section describes how to use ECC algorithms with the CMS 
   EnvelopedData format. 

   This document does not specify the static-static ECDH, method C(0,2, 
   ECC CDH) from [SP800-56A].  Static-static ECDH is analogous to 
   static-static DH, which is specified in [CMS-ALG].  Ephemeral-static 
   ECDH and 1-Pass ECMQV were specified because they provide better 
   security due to the originator's ephemeral contribution to the key 
   agreement scheme.

3.1. EnvelopedData using (ephemeral-static) ECDH 

   This section describes how to use the ephemeral-static Elliptic Curve 
   Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement algorithm with EnvelopedData, 
   method C(1, 1, ECC CDH) from [SP800-56A] and ECDH with the standard 
   primitive from Section 3.3.1 of [SEC1].  Ephemeral-static ECDH is the 
   elliptic curve analog of the ephemeral-static Diffie-Hellman key 
   agreement algorithm specified jointly in the documents [CMS-ALG] and 
   [CMS-DH]. 

   If an implementation uses ECDH with CMS EnvelopedData, then the 
   following techniques and formats MUST be used. 

   The fields of EnvelopedData are as in [CMS]; as ECDH is a key 
   agreement algorithm, the RecipientInfo kari choice is used. 

3.1.1. Fields of KeyAgreeRecipientInfo 

   When using ephemeral-static ECDH with EnvelopedData, the fields of 
   KeyAgreeRecipientInfo are as follows: 

     - version MUST be 3. 

     - originator MUST be the alternative originatorKey.  The 
       originatorKey algorithm field MUST contain the id-ecPublicKey 
       object identifier (see Section 7.1.2).  The parameters 
       associated with id-ecPublicKey MUST be absent, ECParameters, or 
       NULL. The parameters associated with id-ecPublicKey SHOULD be 
       absent or ECParameters, and NULL is allowed to support legacy 
       implementations.  The previous version of this document required 
       NULL to be present.  If the parameters are ECParameters, then 
       they MUST be namedCurve.  The originatorKey publicKey field MUST 
       contain the DER-encoding of the value of the ASN.1 type ECPoint 
       (see Section 7.2), which represents the sending agent's 
       ephemeral EC public key.  The ECPoint in uncompressed form MUST 
       be supported. 

     - ukm MAY be present or absent.  However, message originators 
       SHOULD include the ukm. As specified in RFC 3852 [CMS], 
       implementations MUST support ukm message recipient processing, 
       so interoperability is not a concern if the ukm is present or 
       absent.  The ukm is placed in the entityUInfo field of the ECC-
       CMS-SharedInfo structure.  When present, the ukm is used to 
       ensure that a different key-encryption key is generated, even 
       when the ephemeral private key is improperly used more than

       once, by using the ECC-CMS-SharedInfo as an input to the key 
       derivation function (see Section 7.2). 

     - keyEncryptionAlgorithm MUST contain the object identifier of the 
       key encryption algorithm, which in this case is a key agreement 
       algorithm (see Section 7.1.4).  The parameters field contains 
       KeyWrapAlgorithm.  The KeyWrapAlgorithm is the algorithm 
       identifier that indicates the symmetric encryption algorithm 
       used to encrypt the content-encryption key (CEK) with the key-
       encryption key (KEK) and any associated parameters (see Section 
       7.1.5).  Algorithm requirements are found in Section 8. 

     - recipientEncryptedKeys contains an identifier and an encrypted 
       key for each recipient.  The RecipientEncryptedKey 
       KeyAgreeRecipientIdentifier MUST contain either the 
       issuerAndSerialNumber identifying the recipient's certificate or 
       the RecipientKeyIdentifier containing the subject key identifier 
       from the recipient's certificate.  In both cases, the 
       recipient's certificate contains the recipient's static ECDH 
       public key.  RecipientEncryptedKey EncryptedKey MUST contain the 
       content-encryption key encrypted with the ephemeral-static, 
       ECDH-generated pairwise key-encryption key using the algorithm 
       specified by the KeyWrapAlgorithm. 

3.1.2. Actions of the sending agent 

   When using ephemeral-static ECDH with EnvelopedData, the sending 
   agent first obtains the recipient's EC public key and domain 
   parameters (e.g. from the recipient's certificate).  The sending 
   agent then determines an integer "keydatalen", which is the 
   KeyWrapAlgorithm symmetric key-size in bits, and also a bit string 
   "SharedInfo", which is the DER encoding of ECC-CMS-SharedInfo (see 
   Section 7.2).  The sending agent then performs the key deployment and 
   the key agreement operation of the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman 
   Scheme specified in [SP800-56A] or [SEC1]; in either case, use the 
   KDF defined in Section 3.6.1 of [SEC1] with the hash algorithm 
   identified in the key agreement algorithm.  As a result the sending 
   agent obtains: 

     - an ephemeral public key, which is represented as a value of the 
       type ECPoint (see Section 7.2), encapsulated in a bit string and 
       placed in the KeyAgreeRecipientInfo originator originatorKey 
       publicKey field, and

Internet-Draft        Use of ECC Algorithms in CMS            June 2008 
    

     - a shared secret bit string "K", which is used as the pairwise 
       key-encryption key for that recipient, as specified in [CMS]. 

   In a single message, if there are multiple layers for a recipient, 
   then the ephemeral public key can be reused by the originator for 
   that recipient in each of the different layers.  

3.1.3. Actions of the receiving agent 

   When using ephemeral-static ECDH with EnvelopedData, the receiving 
   agent determines the bit string "SharedInfo", which is the DER 
   encoding of ECC-CMS-SharedInfo (see Section 7.2), and the integer 
   "keydatalen" from the key-size, in bits, of the KeyWrapAlgorithm. The 
   receiving agent retrieves the ephemeral EC public key from the bit 
   string KeyAgreeRecipientInfo originator, with a value of the type 
   ECPoint (see Section 7.2) encapsulated as a bit string, and if 
   present, originally supplied additional user key material from the 
   ukm field.  The receiving agent performs the key agreement operation 
   of the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Scheme specified in [SP800-56A] 
   or [SEC1]; in either case, use the KDF defined in Section 3.6.1 of 
   [SEC1].  As a result, the receiving agent obtains a shared secret bit 
   string "K", which is used as the pairwise key-encryption key to 
   unwrap the CEK. 

3.2. EnvelopedData using 1-Pass ECMQV 

   This section describes how to use the 1-Pass elliptic curve MQV 
   (ECMQV) key agreement algorithm with EnvelopedData, method 
   C(1, 2, ECC MQV) from [SP800-56A].  Like the KEA algorithm [CMS-KEA], 
   1-Pass ECMQV uses three key pairs: an ephemeral key pair, a static 
   key pair of the sending agent, and a static key pair of the receiving 
   agent.  Using an algorithm with the sender static key pair allows for 
   knowledge of the message creator, this means that authentication can, 
   in some circumstances, be obtained for AuthEnvelopedData and 
   AuthenticatedData.  This means that 1-Pass ECMQV can be a common 
   algorithm for EnvelopedData, AuthenticatedData and AuthEnvelopedData, 
   while ECDH can only be used in EnvelopedData. 

   If an implementation uses 1-Pass ECMQV with CMS EnvelopedData, then 
   the following techniques and formats MUST be used. 

   The fields of EnvelopedData are as in [CMS]; as 1-Pass ECMQV is a key 
   agreement algorithm, the RecipientInfo kari choice is used.  When 
   using 1-Pass ECMQV, the EnvelopedData originatorInfo field MAY 
   include the certificate(s) for the EC public key(s) used in the

   formation of the pairwise key.  ECC certificates are discussed in 
   Section 5. 

3.2.1. Fields of KeyAgreeRecipientInfo 

   When using 1-Pass ECMQV with EnvelopedData, the fields of 
   KeyAgreeRecipientInfo are: 

     - version MUST be 3. 

     - originator identifies the static EC public key of the sender.  It 
       SHOULD be one of the alternatives, issuerAndSerialNumber or 
       subjectKeyIdentifier, and point to one of the sending agent's 
       certificates. 

     - ukm MUST be present.  The ukm field is an octet string which MUST 
       contain the DER encoding of the type MQVuserKeyingMaterial (see 
       Section 7.2).  The MQVuserKeyingMaterial ephemeralPublicKey 
       algorithm field MUST contain the id-ecPublicKey object 
       identifier (see Section 7.1.2).  The parameters associated with 
       id-ecPublicKey MUST be absent, ECParameters, or NULL. The 
       parameters associated with id-ecPublicKey SHOULD be absent or 
       ECParameters, as NULL is allowed to support legacy 
       implementations.  The previous version of this document required 
       NULL to be present.  If the parameters are ECParameters, then 
       they MUST be namedCurve.  The MQVuserKeyingMaterial 
       ephemeralPublicKey publicKey field MUST contain the DER-encoding 
       of the ASN.1 type ECPoint (see Section 7.2) representing the 
       sending agent's ephemeral EC public key.  The 
       MQVuserKeyingMaterial addedukm field, if present, contains 
       additional user keying material from the sending agent. 

     - keyEncryptionAlgorithm MUST contain the object identifier of the 
       key encryption algorithm, which in this case is a key agreement 
       algorithm (see Section 7.1.4).  The parameters field contains 
       KeyWrapAlgorithm.  The KeyWrapAlgorithm indicates the symmetric 
       encryption algorithm used to encrypt the CEK with the KEK 
       generated using the 1-Pass ECMQV algorithm and any associated 
       parameters (see Section 7.1.5).  Algorithm requirements are 
       found in Section 8. 

     - recipientEncryptedKeys contains an identifier and an encrypted 
       key for each recipient.  The RecipientEncryptedKey 
       KeyAgreeRecipientIdentifier MUST contain either the 
       issuerAndSerialNumber identifying the recipient's certificate or

Internet-Draft        Use of ECC Algorithms in CMS            June 2008 
    

       the RecipientKeyIdentifier containing the subject key identifier 
       from the recipient's certificate.  In both cases, the 
       recipient's certificate contains the recipient's static ECMQV 
       public key.  RecipientEncryptedKey EncryptedKey MUST contain the 
       content-encryption key encrypted with the 1-Pass ECMQV-generated 
       pairwise key-encryption key using the algorithm specified by the 
       KeyWrapAlgorithm. 

3.2.2. Actions of the sending agent 

   When using 1-Pass ECMQV with EnvelopedData, the sending agent first 
   obtains the recipient's EC public key and domain parameters (e.g. 
   from the recipient's certificate), and checks that the domain 
   parameters are the same as the sender's domain parameters.  The 
   sending agent then determines an integer "keydatalen", which is the 
   KeyWrapAlgorithm symmetric key-size in bits, and also a bit string 
   "SharedInfo", which is the DER encoding of ECC-CMS-SharedInfo (see 
   Section 7.2).  The sending agent then performs the key deployment and 
   key agreement operations of the Elliptic Curve MQV Scheme specified 
   in [SP800-56A], but uses the KDF defined in Section 3.6.1 of [SEC1].  
   As a result, the sending agent obtains: 

     - an ephemeral public key, which is represented as a value of type 
       ECPoint (see Section 7.2), encapsulated in a bit string, placed 
       in an MQVuserKeyingMaterial ephemeralPublicKey publicKey field 
       (see Section 7.2), and 

     - a shared secret bit string "K", which is used as the pairwise 
       key-encryption key for that recipient, as specified in [CMS]. 

   In a single message, if there are multiple layers for a recipient, 
   then the ephemeral public key can be reused by the originator for 
   that recipient in each of the different layers. 

3.2.3. Actions of the receiving agent 

   When using 1-Pass ECMQV with EnvelopedData, the receiving agent 
   determines the bit string "SharedInfo", which is the DER encoding of 
   ECC-CMS-SharedInfo (see Section 7.2), and the integer "keydatalen" 
   from the key-size, in bits, of the KeyWrapAlgorithm.  The receiving 
   agent then retrieves the static and ephemeral EC public keys of the 
   originator, from the originator and ukm fields as described in 
   Section 3.2.1, and its static EC public key identified in the rid 
   field and checks that the originator's domain parameters are the same 
   as the recipient's domain parameters.  The receiving agent then

   performs the key agreement operation of the Elliptic Curve MQV Scheme 
   [SP800-56A], but uses the KDF defined in Section 3.6.1 of [SEC1].  As 
   a result, the receiving agent obtains a shared secret bit string "K", 
   which is used as the pairwise key-encryption key to unwrap the CEK. 

4. AuthenticatedData and AuthEnvelopedData using ECC 

   This section describes how to use ECC algorithms with the CMS 
   AuthenticatedData format.  AuthenticatedData lacks non-repudiation, 
   and so in some instances is preferable to SignedData.  (For example, 
   the sending agent might not want the message to be authenticated when 
   forwarded.) 

   This section also describes how to use ECC algorithms with the CMS 
   AuthEnvelopedData format [CMS-AUTHENV].  AuthEnvelopedData supports 
   authentication and encryption, and in some instances is preferable to 
   signing and then encrypting data. 

   For both AuthenticatedData and AuthEnvelopedData, data origin 
   authentication with 1-Pass ECMQV can only be provided when there is 
   one and only one recipient.  When there are multiple recipients, an 
   attack is possible where one recipient modifies the content without 
   other recipients noticing [BON].  A sending agent who is concerned 
   with such an attack SHOULD use a separate AuthenticatedData or 
   AuthEnvelopedData for each recipient. 

   Using an algorithm with the sender static key pair allows for 
   knowledge of the message creator; this means that authentication can, 
   in some circumstances, be obtained for AuthEnvelopedData and 
   AuthenticatedData.  This means that 1-Pass ECMQV can be a common 
   algorithm for EnvelopedData, AuthenticatedData, and AuthEnvelopedData 
   while ECDH can only be used in EnvelopedData. 

4.1. AuthenticatedData using 1-pass ECMQV 

   This section describes how to use the 1-Pass elliptic curve MQV 
   (ECMQV) key agreement algorithm with AuthenticatedData.  ECMQV is 
   method C(1, 2, ECC MQV) from [SP800-56A]. 

   When using ECMQV with AuthenticatedData, the fields of 
   AuthenticatedData are as in [CMS], but with the following 
   restrictions: 

     - macAlgorithm MUST contain the algorithm identifier of the message 
       authentication code (MAC) algorithm (see Section 7.1.7) which

       MUST be one of the following: hmac-SHA1, id-hmacWITHSHA224, id-
       hmacWITHSHA256, id-hmacWITHSHA384, or id-hmacWITHSHA512. 

     - digestAlgorithm MUST contain the algorithm identifier of the hash 
       algorithm (see Section 7.1.1) which MUST be one of the 
       following: id-sha1, id-sha224, id-sha256, id-sha384, and id-
       sha512. 

   As 1-Pass ECMQV is a key agreement algorithm, the RecipientInfo kari 
   choice is used in the AuthenticatedData.  When using 1-Pass ECMQV, 
   the AuthenticatedData originatorInfo field MAY include the 
   certificate(s) for the EC public key(s) used in the formation of the 
   pairwise key.  ECC certificates are discussed in Section 5. 

4.1.1. Fields of the KeyAgreeRecipientInfo 

   The AuthenticatedData KeyAgreeRecipientInfo fields are used in the 
   same manner as the fields for the corresponding EnvelopedData 
   KeyAgreeRecipientInfo fields of Section 3.2.1 of this document. 

4.1.2. Actions of the sending agent 

   The sending agent uses the same actions as for EnvelopedData with  
   1-Pass ECMQV, as specified in Section 3.2.2 of this document. 

   In a single message, if there are multiple layers for a recipient, 
   then the ephemeral public key can be reused by the originator for 
   that recipient in each of the different layers. 

4.1.3. Actions of the receiving agent 

   The receiving agent uses the same actions as for EnvelopedData with 
   1-Pass ECMQV, as specified in Section 3.2.3 of this document. 

4.2. AuthEnvelopedData using 1-pass ECMQV 

   This section describes how to use the 1-Pass elliptic curve MQV 
   (ECMQV) key agreement algorithm with AuthEnvelopedData.  ECMQV is 
   method C(1, 2, ECC MQV) from [SP800-56A]. 

   When using ECMQV with AuthEnvelopedData, the fields of 
   AuthEnvelopedData are as in [CMS-AUTHENV]. 

   As 1-Pass ECMQV is a key agreement algorithm, the RecipientInfo kari 
   choice is used.  When using 1-Pass ECMQV, the AuthEnvelopedData

   originatorInfo field MAY include the certificate(s) for the EC public 
   key used in the formation of the pairwise key.  ECC certificates are 
   discussed in Section 5. 

4.2.1. Fields of the KeyAgreeRecipientInfo 

   The AuthEnvelopedData KeyAgreeRecipientInfo fields are used in the 
   same manner as the fields for the corresponding EnvelopedData 
   KeyAgreeRecipientInfo fields of Section 3.2.1 of this document. 

4.2.2. Actions of the sending agent 

   The sending agent uses the same actions as for EnvelopedData with 1-
   Pass ECMQV, as specified in Section 3.2.2 of this document. 

   In a single message, if there are multiple layers for a recipient, 
   then the ephemeral public key can be reused by the originator for 
   that recipient in each of the different layers. 

4.2.3. Actions of the receiving agent 

   The receiving agent uses the same actions as for EnvelopedData with 
   1-Pass ECMQV, as specified in Section 3.2.3 of this document. 

5. Certificates using ECC 

   Internet X.509 certificates [PKI] can be used in conjunction with 
   this specification to distribute agents' public keys.  The use of ECC 
   algorithms and keys within X.509 certificates is specified in [PKI-
   ALG]. 

6. SMIMECapabilities Attribute and ECC 

   A sending agent MAY announce to receiving agents that it supports one 
   or more of the ECC algorithms specified in this document by using the 
   SMIMECapabilities signed attribute [MSG] in either a signed message 
   or a certificate [CERTCAP].

   The SMIMECapabilities attribute value indicates support for one of 
   the ECDSA signature algorithms in a SEQUENCE with the capabilityID 
   field containing the object identifier ecdsa-with-SHA1 with NULL 
   parameters and ecdsa-with-SHA* (where * is 224, 256, 384, or 512) 
   with absent parameters.  The DER encodings are: 

      ecdsa-with-SHA1:   30 0b 06 07 2a 86 48 ce 3d 04 01 05 00 

      ecdsa-with-SHA224: 30 0a 06 08 2a 86 48 ce 3d 04 03 01 

      ecdsa-with-SHA256: 30 0a 06 08 2a 86 48 ce 3d 04 03 02 

      ecdsa-with-SHA384: 30 0a 06 08 2a 86 48 ce 3d 04 03 03 

      ecdsa-with-SHA512: 30 0a 06 08 2a 86 48 ce 3d 04 03 04 

   NOTE: The SMIMECapabilities attribute indicates that parameters for 
   ECDSA with SHA-1 are NULL; however, the parameters are absent when 
   used to generate a digital signature. 

   The SMIMECapabilities attribute value indicates support for 
     a)  the standard ECDH key agreement algorithm, 
     b)  the cofactor ECDH key agreement algorithm, or 
     c)  the 1-Pass ECMQV key agreement algorithm and  
   is a SEQUENCE with the capabilityID field containing the object 
   identifier 
     a)  dhSinglePass-stdDH-sha*kdf-scheme, 
     b)  dhSinglePass-cofactorDH-sha*kdf-scheme, or 
     c)  mqvSinglePass-sha*kdf-scheme 
   respectively (where * is 1, 224, 256, 384, or 512) with the 
   parameters present.  The parameters indicate the supported key-
   encryption algorithm with the KeyWrapAlgorithm algorithm identifier. 

   The DER encodings that indicate capabilities are as follows (KA is 
   key agreement, KDF is key derivation function, and Wrap is key wrap 
   algorithm):

7. ASN.1 Syntax 

   The ASN.1 syntax [X.680], [X.681], X.682], [X.683] used in this 
   document is gathered in this section for reference purposes. 

7.1. Algorithm Identifiers 

   This section provides the object identifiers for the algorithms used 
   in this document along with any associated parameters. 

7.1.1. Digest Algorithms 

   Digest algorithm object identifiers are used in the SignedData 
   digestAlgorithms and digestAlgorithm fields and the AuthenticatedData

   digestAlgorithm field.  The digest algorithms used in this document 
   are: SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512.  The object 
   identifiers and parameters associated with these algorithms are found 
   in [CMS-ALG] and [CMS-SHA2]. 

7.1.2. Originator Public Key 

   The KeyAgreeRecipientInfo originator field uses the following object 
   identifier to indicate an elliptic curve public key: 

      id-ecPublicKey OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 
        ansi-x9-62 keyType(2) 1 } 

   where 

      ansi-x9-62 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 
        iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) 10045 } 

   When the object identifier id-ecPublicKey is used here with an 
   algorithm identifier, the associated parameters MUST be either absent 
   or ECParameters.  Implementations MUST accept id-ecPublicKey with 
   absent and ECParameters parameters.  If ECParameters is present, its 
   value MUST match the recipient's ECParameters.  Implementations 
   SHOULD generate absent parameters for the id-ecPublicKey object 
   identifier in the KeyAgreeRecipientInfo originator field. 

   [CMS-ECC] indicated the parameters were NULL.  Support for this 
   legacy form is OPTIONAL. 

7.1.3. Signature Algorithms 

   Signature algorithm identifiers are used in the SignedData 
   signatureAlgorithm and signature fields.  The signature algorithms 
   used in this document are ECDSA with SHA-1, ECDSA with SHA-224, ECDSA 
   with SHA-256, ECDSA with SHA-384, and ECDSA with SHA-512.  The object 
   identifiers and parameters associated with these algorithms are found 
   in [PKI-ALG]. 

   [CMS-ECC] indicated the parameters were NULL.  Support for this 
   legacy form is OPTIONAL. 

7.1.4. Key Agreement Algorithms 

   Key agreement algorithms are used in EnvelopedData, 
   AuthenticatedData, and AuthEnvelopedData in the KeyAgreeRecipientInfo

   keyEncryptionAlgorithm field.  The following object identifiers 
   indicate the key agreement algorithms used in this document [SP800-
   56A], [SEC1]: 

      dhSinglePass-stdDH-sha1kdf-scheme OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 
        x9-63-scheme 2 }

        secg-scheme 14 2 } 

      dhSinglePass-cofactorDH-sha512kdf-scheme OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 
        secg-scheme 14 3 } 

      mqvSinglePass-sha1kdf-scheme OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 
        x9-63-scheme 16 } 

      mqvSinglePass-sha224kdf-scheme OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 
        secg-scheme 15 0 } 

      mqvSinglePass-sha256kdf-scheme OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 
        secg-scheme 15 1 } 

      mqvSinglePass-sha384kdf-scheme OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 
        secg-scheme 15 2 }

      mqvSinglePass-sha512kdf-scheme OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 
        secg-scheme 15 3 } 

   where 

      x9-63-scheme OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 
        iso(1) identified-organization(3) tc68(133) country(16) 
        x9(840) x9-63(63) schemes(0) } 

   and 

      secg-scheme OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 
        iso(1) identified-organization(3) certicom(132) schemes(1) } 

   When the object identifiers are used here within an algorithm 
   identifier, the associated parameters field contains KeyWrapAlgorithm 
   to indicate the key wrap algorithm and any associated parameters. 

7.1.5. Key Wrap Algorithms 

   Key wrap algorithms are used as part of the parameters in the key 
   agreement algorithm.  The key wrap algorithms used in this document 
   are Triple-DES, AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256.  The object 
   identifiers and parameters for these algorithms are found in [CMS-
   ALG] and [CMS-AES]. 

7.1.6. Content Encryption Algorithms 

   Content encryption algorithms are used in EnvelopedData and 
   AuthEnvelopedData in the EncryptedContentInfo 
   contentEncryptionAlgorithm field.  The content encryption algorithms 
   used with EnvelopedData in this document are 3-Key Triple DES in CBC 
   mode, AES-128 in CBC mode, AES-192 in CBC mode, and AES-256 in CBC 
   mode.  The object identifiers and parameters associated with these 
   algorithms are found in [CMS-ALG] and [CMS-AES].  The content 
   encryption algorithms used with AuthEnvelopedData in this document 
   are AES-128 in CCM mode, AES-192 in CCM mode, AES-256 in CCM mode, 
   AES-128 in GCM mode, AES-192 in GCM mode, and AES-256 in GCM mode.  
   The object identifiers and parameters associated with these 
   algorithms are found in [CMS-AESCG]. 

7.1.7. Message Authentication Code Algorithms 

   Message authentication code algorithms are used in AuthenticatedData 
   in the macAlgorithm field.  The message authentication code

Internet-Draft        Use of ECC Algorithms in CMS            June 2008 
    

   algorithms used in this document are HMAC with SHA-1, HMAC with SHA-
   224, HMAC with SHA-256, HMAC with SHA-384, and HMAC with SHA-512.  
   The object identifiers and parameters associated with these 
   algorithms are found in [CMS-ALG] and [HMAC-SHA2]. 

   NOTE: [HMAC-SHA2] defines the object identifiers for HMAC with SHA-
   224, HMAC with SHA-256, HMAC with SHA-384, and HMAC with SHA-512, but 
   there is no ASN.1 module from which to import these object 
   identifiers.  Therefore, the object identifiers for these algorithms 
   are included in the ASN.1 modules defined in Appendix A. 

7.1.8. Key Derivation Algorithm 

   The KDF used in this document is as specified in 3.6.1 of [SEC1].  
   The hash algorithm is identified in key agreement algorithm.  For 
   example, dhSinglePass-stdDH-sha256kdf-scheme uses the KDF from [SEC1] 
   but uses SHA-256 instead of SHA-1. 

7.2. Other Syntax 

   The following additional syntax is used here. 

   When using ECDSA with SignedData, ECDSA signatures are encoded using 
   the type: 

     ECDSA-Sig-Value ::= SEQUENCE { 
       r INTEGER, 
       s INTEGER } 

   ECDSA-Sig-Value is specified in [PKI-ALG].  Within CMS, ECDSA-Sig-
   Value is DER-encoded and placed within a signature field of 
   SignedData. 

   When using ECDH and ECMQV with EnvelopedData, AuthenticatedData, and 
   AuthEnvelopedData, ephemeral and static public keys are encoded using 
   the type ECPoint. Implementations MUST support uncompressed keys, MAY 
   support compressed keys, and MUST NOT support hybrid keys. 

     ECPoint ::= OCTET STRING

Internet-Draft        Use of ECC Algorithms in CMS            June 2008 
    

   When using ECMQV with EnvelopedData, AuthenticatedData, and 
   AuthEnvelopedData, the sending agent's ephemeral public key and 
   additional keying material are encoded using the type: 

     MQVuserKeyingMaterial ::= SEQUENCE { 
       ephemeralPublicKey      OriginatorPublicKey, 
       addedukm            [0] EXPLICIT UserKeyingMaterial OPTIONAL  } 

   The ECPoint syntax is used to represent the ephemeral public key and 
   is placed in the ephemeralPublicKey publicKey field.  The additional 
   user keying material is placed in the addedukm field.  Then the 
   MQVuserKeyingMaterial value is DER-encoded and placed within the ukm 
   field of EnvelopedData, AuthenticatedData, or AuthEnvelopedData. 

   When using ECDH or ECMQV with EnvelopedData, AuthenticatedData, or 
   AuthEnvelopedData, the key-encryption keys are derived by using the 
   type: 

     ECC-CMS-SharedInfo ::= SEQUENCE { 
       keyInfo         AlgorithmIdentifier, 
       entityUInfo [0] EXPLICIT OCTET STRING OPTIONAL, 
       suppPubInfo [2] EXPLICIT OCTET STRING  } 

   The fields of ECC-CMS-SharedInfo are as follows: 

      keyInfo contains the object identifier of the key-encryption 
      algorithm (used to wrap the CEK) and associated parameters. In 
      this specification, 3DES wrap has NULL parameters while the AES 
      wraps have absent parameters. 

      entityUInfo optionally contains additional keying material 
      supplied by the sending agent.  When used with ECDH and CMS, the 
      entityUInfo field contains the octet string ukm.  When used with 
      ECMQV and CMS, the entityUInfo contains the octet string addedukm 
      (encoded in MQVuserKeyingMaterial). 

      suppPubInfo contains the length of the generated KEK, in bits, 
      represented as a 32 bit number, as in [CMS-DH] and [CMS-AES].  
      (E.g. for AES-256 it would be 00 00 01 00.) 

   Within CMS, ECC-CMS-SharedInfo is DER-encoded and used as input to 
   the key derivation function, as specified in Section 3.6.1 of [SEC1]. 

   NOTE: ECC-CMS-SharedInfo differs from the OtherInfo specified in 
   [CMS-DH].  Here, a counter value is not included in the keyInfo field

   because the key derivation function specified in Section 3.6.1 of 
   [SEC1] ensures that sufficient keying data is provided. 

8. Recommended Algorithms and Elliptic Curves 

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementations of this specification support 
   SignedData and EnvelopedData. Support for AuthenticatedData and 
   AuthEnvelopedData is OPTIONAL. 

   In order to encourage interoperability, implementations SHOULD use 
   the elliptic curve domain parameters specified by [PKI-ALG]. 

   Implementations that support SignedData with ECDSA: 

     - MUST support ECDSA with SHA-256; and, 

     - MAY support ECDSA with SHA-1, ECDSA with SHA-224, ECDSA with SHA-
       384, and ECDSA with SHA-512; other digital signature algorithms 
       MAY also be supported. 

   When using ECDSA, to promote interoperability it is RECOMMENDED that 
   the P-192, P-224, and the P-256 curves be used with SHA-256, the P-
   384 curve be used with SHA-384, and the P-521 curve be used with SHA-
   512. 

   If EnvelopedData is supported, then ephemeral-static ECDH standard 
   primitive MUST be supported.  Support for ephemeral-static ECDH co-
   factor is OPTIONAL and support for 1-Pass ECMQV is also OPTIONAL. 

   Implementations that support EnvelopedData with the ephemeral-static 
   ECDH standard primitive: 

     - MUST support the dhSinglePass-stdDH-sha256kdf-scheme key 
       agreement algorithm, the id-aes128-wrap key wrap algorithm, and 
       the id-aes128-cbc content encryption algorithm; and, 

     - MAY support the dhSinglePass-stdDH-sha1kdf-scheme, dhSinglePass-
       stdDH-sha224kdf-scheme, dhSinglePass-stdDH-sha384kdf-scheme and 
       dhSinglePass-stdDH-sha512kdf-scheme key agreement algorithms, 
       the id-alg-CMS3DESwrap, id-aes192-wrap, and id-aes256-wrap key 
       wrap algorithms and the des-ede3-cbc, id-aes192-cbc, and id-
       aes256-cbc content encryption algorithms; other algorithms MAY 
       also be supported.

9. Security Considerations 

   Cryptographic algorithms will be broken or weakened over time.  
   Implementers and users need to check that the cryptographic 
   algorithms listed in this document continue to provide the expected 
   level of security.  The IETF from time to time may issue documents 
   dealing with the current state of the art. 

   Cryptographic algorithms rely on random numbers.  See [RANDOM] for 
   guidance on generation of random numbers. 

   Receiving agents that validate signatures and sending agents that 
   encrypt messages need to be cautious of cryptographic processing 
   usage when validating signatures and encrypting messages using keys 
   larger than those mandated in this specification.  An attacker could 
   send keys and/or certificates with keys which would result in 
   excessive cryptographic processing, for example keys larger than 
   those mandated in this specification, which could swamp the 
   processing element.  Agents which use such keys without first 
   validating the certificate to a trust anchor are advised to have some 
   sort of cryptographic resource management system to prevent such 
   attacks. 

   Using secret keys of an appropriate size is crucial to the security 
   of a Diffie-Hellman exchange.  For elliptic curve groups, the size of 
   the secret key must be equal to the size of n (the order of the group 
   generated by the point g).  Using larger secret keys provides 
   absolutely no additional security, and using smaller secret keys is 
   likely to result in dramatically less security.  (See [SP800-56A] for 
   more information on selecting secret keys.)

   This specification is based on [CMS], [CMS-AES], [CMS-AESCG], [CMS-
   ALG], [CMS-AUTHENV], [CMS-DH], [CMS-SHA2], [FIPS180-3], [FIPS186-3], 
   and [HMAC-SHA2], and the appropriate security considerations of those 
   documents apply. 

   In addition, implementers of AuthenticatedData and AuthEnvelopedData 
   should be aware of the concerns expressed in [BON] when using 
   AuthenticatedData and AuthEnvelopedData to send messages to more than 
   one recipient.  Also, users of MQV should be aware of the 
   vulnerability described in [K]. 

   When implementing EnvelopedData, AuthenticatedData, and 
   AuthEnvelopedData, there are five algorithm related choices that need 
   to be made: 

   1) What is the public key size? 
   2) What is the KDF? 
   3) What is the key wrap algorithm? 
   4) What is the content encryption algorithm? 
   5) What is the curve? 

   Consideration must be given to the strength of the security provided 
   by each of these choices. Security algorithm strength is measured in 
   bits, where bits is measured in equivalence to a symmetric cipher 
   algorithm.  Thus a strong symmetric cipher algorithm with a key of X 
   bits is said to provide X bits of security. For other algorithms, the 
   key size is mapped to an equivalent symmetric cipher strength. It is 
   recommended that the bits of security provided by each are roughly 
   equivalent. The following table provides comparable minimum bits of 
   security [SP800-57] for the ECDH/ECMQV key sizes, KDFs, key wrapping 
   algorithms, and content encryption algorithms. It also lists curves 
   [PKI-ALG] for the key sizes.

   When implementing SignedData, there are three algorithm related 
   choices that need to be made: 

   1) What is the public key size? 
   2) What is the hash algorithm? 
   3) What is the curve? 

   Consideration must be given to the bits of security provided by each 
   of these choices. Security is measured in bits, where a strong 
   symmetric cipher with a key of X bits is said to provide X bits of 
   security. It is recommended that the bits of security provided by 
   each choice are roughly equivalent.  The following table provides 
   comparable minimum bits of security [SP800-57] for the ECDSA key 
   sizes and message digest algorithms. It also lists curves [PKI-ALG] 
   for the key sizes.

10. IANA Considerations 

   This document makes extensive use of object identifiers to register 
   originator public key types and algorithms. The algorithm object 
   identifiers are registered in the ANSI X9.62, ANSI X9.63, NIST, RSA, 
   and SECG arcs. Additionally, object identifiers are used to identify 
   the ASN.1 modules found in Appendix A (there are two). These are 
   defined by the SMIME WG Registrar in an arc delegated by RSA to the 
   SMIME Working Group: iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) 
   pkcs(1) pkcs-9(9) smime(16) modules(0).  No action by IANA is 
   necessary for this document or any anticipated updates.

Appendix A ASN.1 Modules 

   Appendix A.1 provides the normative ASN.1 definitions for the 
   structures described in this specification using ASN.1 as defined in 
   [X.680] for compilers that support the 1988 ASN.1. 

   Appendix A.2 provides informative ASN.1 definitions for the 
   structures described in this specification using ASN.1 as defined in 
   [X.680], [X.681], [X.682], and [X.683] for compilers that support the 
   2002 ASN.1. This appendix contains the same information as Appendix 
   A.1 in a more recent (and precise) ASN.1 notation, however Appendix 
   A.1 takes precedence in case of conflict. 

   NOTE: The values for the TBAs will be included during AUTH48.

Appendix B Changes since RFC 3278 

   The following summarizes the changes: 

     - Abstract: The basis of the document was changed to refer to NIST 
       FIPS 186-3 and SP800-56A.  However, to maintain backwards 
       compatibility the Key Derivation Function from ANSI/SEC1 is 
       retained. 

     - Section 1: A bullet was added to address AuthEnvelopedData. 

     - Section 2.1: A sentence was added to indicate FIPS180-3 is used 
       with ECDSA.  Replaced reference to ANSI X9.62 with FIPS186-3. 

     - Section 2.1.1: The permitted digest algorithms were expanded from 
       SHA-1 to SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512. 

     - Section 2.1.2 and 2.1.3: The bullet addressing integer "e" was 
       deleted. 

     - Section 3: Added explanation of why static-static ECDH is not 
       included. 

     - Section 3.1: The reference for DH was changed from RFC 3852 to 
       RFC 3370.  Provided text to indicate fields of EnvelopedData are 
       as in CMS. 

     - Section 3.1.1: The text was updated to include description of all 
       KeyAgreeRecipientInfo fields.  Parameters for id-ecPublicKey 
       field changed from NULL to absent or ECParameter.  Additional 
       information about ukm was added. 

     - Section 3.2: The sentence describing the advantages of 1-Pass 
       ECMQV was rewritten.

     - Section 3.2.1: The text was updated to include description of all 
       fields.  Parameters for id-ecPublicKey field changed from NULL 
       to absent or ECParameters. 

     - Sections 3.2.2 and 4.1.2: The re-use of ephemeral keys paragraph 
       was reworded. 

     - Section 4.1:  The sentences describing the advantages of 1-Pass 
       ECMQV was moved to Section 4. 

     - Section 4.1.2: The note about the attack was moved to Section 4. 

     - Section 4.2: This section was added to address AuthEnvelopedData 
       with ECMQV. 

     - Section 5: This section was moved to Section 8.  The 1st 
       paragraph was modified to recommend both SignedData and 
       EnvelopedData.  The requirements were updated for hash 
       algorithms and recommendations for matching curves and hash 
       algorithms.  Also the requirements were expanded to indicate 
       which ECDH and ECMQV variants, key wrap algorithms, and content 
       encryption algorithms are required for each of the content types 
       used in this document.  The permitted digest algorithms used in 
       key derivations functions (KDFs) were expanded from SHA-1 to 
       SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512. 

     - Section 6 (formerly 7): This section was updated to allow for 
       SMIMECapabilities to be present in certificates.  The S/MIME 
       capabilities for ECDSA with SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-
       512 were added to the list of S/MIME Capabilities.  Also updated 
       to include S/MIME capabilities for ECDH and ECMQV using the SHA-
       224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 algorithms as the KDF. 

     - Section 7.1 (formerly 8.1): Added sub-sections for digest, 
       signature, originator public key, key agreement, content 
       encryption, key wrap, and message authentication code 
       algorithms.  Pointed to algorithms and parameters in appropriate 
       documents for: SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 as well as 
       SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 with ECDSA. Also added 
       algorithm identifiers for ECDH std, ECDH cofactor, and ECMQV 
       with SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 algorithms as the 
       KDF.  Changed id-ecPublicKey parameters to be absent, NULL, or 
       ECParameters, and if present the originator's ECParameters must 
       match the recipient's ECParameters.

     - Section 7.2 (formerly 8.2): Updated to include AuthEnvelopedData.  
       Also, added text to address support requirement for compressed, 
       uncompressed, and hybrid keys, changed pointers from ANSI X9.61 
       to PKIX (where ECDSA-Sig-Value is imported), changed pointers 
       from SECG to NIST specs, and updated example of suppPubInfo to 
       be AES-256.  keyInfo's parameters changed from NULL to any 
       associated parameters (AES wraps have absent parameters). 

     - Section 9: Replaced text, which was a summary paragraph, with an 
       updated security considerations section.  Paragraph referring to 
       definitions of SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 is 
       deleted. 

     - Updated references. 

     - Added ASN.1 modules. 

     - Updated acknowledgements section.
