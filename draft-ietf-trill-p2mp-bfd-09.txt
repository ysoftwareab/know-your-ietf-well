                TRILL Support of Point to Multipoint BFD
                      draft-ietf-trill-p2mp-bfd-09

Abstract

   Point to multipoint (P2MP) BFD is designed to verify multipoint
   connectivity.  This document specifies the support of P2MP BFD in
   TRILL.  Similar to TRILL point-to-point BFD, BFD Control packets in
   TRILL P2MP BFD are transmitted using RBridge Channel messages. This
   document updates RFC 7175 and RFC 7177.

1.  Introduction

   TRILL supports multicast forwarding.  Applications based on TRILL
   multicast may need quick detection of multicast failures using P2MP
   BFD [I-D.ietf-bfd-multipoint].  This document specifies TRILL support
   of P2MP BFD.

   To use P2MP BFD, the head end needs to periodically transmit BFD
   Control packets to all tails using TRILL multicast.  A new RBridge
   Channel message is allocated for this purpose.

   In order to execute the global protection of distribution used for
   multicast forwarding [I-D.ietf-trill-resilient-trees], the head needs
   to track the active status of tails
   [I-D.ietf-bfd-multipoint-active-tail].  If the tail loses
   connectivity as detected by not receiving the new RBridge Channel
   message from the head, the tail should notify the head of the lack of
   multipoint connectivity with unicast BFD Control packets.  These
   unicast BFD Control packets are transmitted using the existing
   RBridge Channel message assigned to BFD Control [RFC7175].

   This document updates [RFC7177] as specified in Section 3 and updates
   [RFC7175] as specified in Section 4 and Section 5.

Internet-Draft             P2MP BFD for TRILL           February 7, 2018


2.1.  Acronyms

   Data Label: VLAN or Fine Grained Label [RFC7172].

   BFD: Bidirectional Forwarding Detection

   P2MP: Point to Multi-Point

   TRILL: Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links or Tunneled
   Routing in the Link Layer

2.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Familiarity with [RFC6325], [RFC7175], and [RFC7178] is assumed in
   this document.

3.  Bootstrapping

   The TRILL adjacency mechanism bootstraps the establishment of one-hop
   TRILL BFD sessions [RFC7177]. Multi-hop sessions are expected to be
   configured by the network manager. A slight wording update to the
   second sentence in Section 6 of [RFC7177] is required.

   It currently read:

      If an RBridge supports BFD [RFC7175], it will have learned whether
      the other RBridge has BFD enabled by whether or not a BFD-Enabled
      TLV [RFC6213] was included in its Hellos.

   Now it should read:

      If an RBridge supports BFD [RFC7175] [this document], it will have
      learned whether the other RBridge has BFD enabled by whether or
      not a BFD-Enabled TLV [RFC6213] was included in its Hellos.

4.  A New RBridge Channel Message for P2MP BFD

   RBridge Channel message protocol 0x002 is defined for TRILL point-to-
   point BFD Control packets in [RFC7175].  That RFC provides that if
   the M bit of the TRILL Header of the RBridge channel packet
   containing a BFD Control packet is non-zero, the packet is generally
   dropped.  In P2MP BFD, the head is required to probe tails using

   multicast.  This means the M bit will be set to 1.  For this reason,
   a new RBridge Channel message, whose protocol code point is TBD, is
   specified in this document.  An RBridge that supports P2MP BFD MUST
   support the new RBridge Channel message for P2MP BFD. The capability
   to support the RBridge Channel message for P2MP BFD, and therefore
   support performing P2MP BFD, is announced within the "RBridge Channel
   Protocols Sub-TLV" in LSPs [RFC7176].

   As specified in [RFC7178], when the tail receives TRILL Data packets
   sent as BFD RBridge channel messages, it will absorb the packets
   itself rather than deliver these packets to its attached end-
   stations.

5.  Discriminators and Packet Demultiplexing

   The processing in Section 3.2 of [RFC7175] generally applies except
   that the test on the M bit in the TRILL Header is reversed.  If the M
   bit is zero, the packet MUST be discarded.  If the M bit is one, it
   is processed.

   After the Section 3.2 of [RFC7175] processing, the tail demultiplexes
   incoming BFD packets based on a combination of the source address and
   My Discriminator as specified in [I-D.ietf-bfd-multipoint].  In
   addition to this combination, TRILL P2MP BFD requires that the tail
   use the Data Label, which is either the inner VLAN or the Fine
   Grained Label [RFC7172], for demultiplexing.  If the tail needs to
   notify the head about the failure of a multipath, the tail is
   required to send unicast BFD Control packets using the same Data
   Label as used by the head.

6.  Tracking Active Tails

   According to [I-D.ietf-bfd-multipoint], the head has a session of
   type MultipointHead that is bound to a multipoint path.  Multipoint
   BFD Control packets are sent by this session over the multipoint
   path, and no BFD Control packets are received by it.  Each tail
   dynamically creates a MultipointTail per a multipoint path. 
   MultipointTail sessions receive BFD Control packets from the head
   over multipoint paths.

   An example use is when a multicast tree root needs to keep track of
   all the receivers as in [I-D.ietf-trill-resilient-trees]; this can be
   done by maintaining a session of type MultipointClient per receiver
   that is of interest, as described in [I-D.ietf-bfd-multipoint-active-
   tail].  See [I-D.ietf-bfd-multipoint-active-tail] for detail
   operations of tracking active tails.

7.  Security Considerations

   Multipoint BFD provides its own authentication but does not provide
   encryption (see Security Considerations in [I-D.ietf-bfd-
   multipoint]). As specified in this document, the point-to-multipoint
   BFD payloads are encapsulated in RBridge Channel messages which have
   been extended by [RFC7978] to provide security. [RFC7978] provides
   encryption only for point-to-point extended RBridge Channel messages
   so its encryption facilities are not applicable to this draft.
   However [RFC7978] provides stronger authentication than that
   currently provided in BFD. Thus, there is little reason to use the
   BFD security mechanisms if [RFC7978] authentication is in use. It is
   expected that a future TRILL document will provide for group keying;
   when that occurs, the use of [RFC7978] RBridge Channel security will
   be able to provide both encryption and authentication.

   For general multipoint BFD security considerations, see
   [I-D.ietf-bfd-multipoint].

   For general RBridge Channel security considerations, see [RFC7178].

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is required to allocate a number from the Standards Action range
   of the RBridge Channel Protocols registry which is part of the
   Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) Parameters. The
   number to be allocated is as follows:

          Protocol          Number
          ----------------  ------
          P2MP BFD Control  TBD
