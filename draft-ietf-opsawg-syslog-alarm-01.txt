1.  Introduction

   In addition to sending out alarm information asynchronously via
   protocols such as SNMP or Netconf, many implementations also log
   alarms via syslog.  This memo defines a set of SD-PARAM to support
   logging and defines a mapping of syslog severity to the severity of
   the alarm.

1.1.  terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

   Alarm related terminology is defined in [RFC3877].

2.  Severity Mapping

   The Alarm MIB RFC3877 [RFC3877] defines ITU perceived severities
   which are useful to be able to relate to the syslog message fields,
   particularly in the case where alarms are being logged.  This memo
   describes the representation of ITU perceived severities in
   appropriate syslog fields described in [Syslog].  Syslog offers both
   a so-called SEVERITY as well as STRUCTURED-DATA.  Due to constraints
   in syslog, there is no one-to-one mapping possible for SEVERITY.  A
   STRUCTURED-DATA element is defined to allow inclusion of the
   unmodified ITU perceived severity.

   Syslog supports severity values different from ITU perceived
   severities.  These are defined in section 6.2.1 of [Syslog].  The
   mapping shown in table 1 below SHOULD be used to map ITU perceived
   severities to syslog severities.

           ITU Perceived Severity      syslog SEVERITY (Name)
           Critical                    1 (Alert)
           Major                       2 (Critical)
           Minor                       3 (Error)
           Warning                     4 (Warning)
           Indeterminate               5 (Notice)
           Cleared                     5 (Notice)

        Table 1. ITUPerceivedSeverity to syslog SEVERITY mapping.

3.  Alarm STRUCTURED-DATA Elements

   STRUCTURED-DATA allows to include any structured information into a
   syslog message.  The following are defined to support structuring
   alarm information.

   o  Resource Under Alarm

   o  Probable Cause

   o  Event Type

   o  Perceived Severity

   o  Trend Indication

   o  Resource Mapping

   Support of the alarm SD-ID is optional, but once supported some of
   the SD-PARARMS are mandatory.

3.1.  alarmedResource

   If the alarm SD-ID is supported, the alarmResource SD-PARAM MUST be
   supported.  This item uniquely identifies the resource under alarm
   within the scope of a network element.

3.2.  probableCause

   If the alarm SD-ID is supported, the probableCause SD-PARAM MUST be
   supported.  This parameter is the mnemonic associated with the
   IANAItuProbableCause object defined within [RFC3877] and any
   subsequent extensions defined by IANA.  For example,
   IANAItuProbableCause defines a transmission failure to a probable
   cause of 'transmissionError (10)'.  The value of the parameter in
   this case would be 'transmissionError'"

3.3.  perceivedSeverity

   If the alarm SD-ID is supported, the perceivedSeverity SD-PARAM MUST
   be supported.  Similar to the definition of perceived severity in
   [X.736] and [RFC3877], this object can take the following values:

   o  cleared

   o  indeterminate

Internet-Draft              Alarms in SYSLOG               November 2008


   o  critical

   o  major

   o  minor

   o  warning

   See section 2 for the relationship between this severity and syslog
   severity.

3.4.  eventType

   If the alarm SD-ID is supported, the eventType SD-PARAM SHOULD be
   supported.  This parameter is the mnemonic associated with the
   IANAItuEventType object defined within [RFC3877] and any subsequent
   extensions defined by IANA.  For example, IANAItuEventType defines a
   environmental alarm to a event type of 'environmentalAlarm (6)'.  The
   value of the parameter in this case would be 'environmentalAlarm'"

3.5.  trendIndication

   If the alarm SD-ID is supported, the trendIndication SD-PARAM SHOULD
   be supported.  Similar to the definition of perceived severity in
   [X.733] and [RFC3877], this object can take the following values:

   o  moreSevere

   o  noChange

   o  lessSevere

3.6.  resourceMapping

   If the alarm SD-ID is supported, the resourceMapping SD-PARAM SHOULD
   be supported.  This item uniquely identifies the resource under alarm
   within the scope of a network element.  This must be the same value
   as alarmActiveResourceId [RFC3877] for this alarm or follow similar
   semantics if the Alarm MIB is not supported.

4.  Security Considerations

   In addition to general syslog security considerations discussed in
   [Syslog], the information contained with alarms may provide hackers
   with helpful information about parts of the system currently
   experiencing stress as well as general information about the system
   such as inventory.

   Users should not have access to information in alarms that their
   normal access permissions would not permit if the information was
   accessed in another manner.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register the SD-IDs and PARAM-NAMEs shown below:

   SD-ID              PARAM-NAME
   alarm                                 OPTIONAL
                      alarmedResource    MANDATORY
                      probableCause      MANDATORY
                      perceivedSeverity  MANDATORY
                      eventType          OPTIONAL
                      trendIndication    OPTIONAL
                      resourceMapping    OPTIONAL
