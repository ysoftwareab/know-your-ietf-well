Abstract

   This memo extends the RTP Payload Format for Uncompressed Video to
   support additional RGB sampling modes.

1.  Introduction

   The RTP Payload Format for Uncompressed Video [1] defines a scheme to
   packetise uncompressed, studio-quality, video streams for transport
   using RTP [2].  A range of standard and high definition video formats

   are supported, and parameters are defined so sender and receiver can
   signal the image size, colour space, pixel depth, etc.

   A limitation of the format is that the number of bits per sample is
   signalled as being the same for each colour component.  For example,
   it is not possible to signal transport of RGB format video using 5
   bits each for the Red and Blue components and 6 bits for the Green,
   packing one pixel into two octets.  Such video formats can easily be
   supported in the payload format, but cannot be signalled using the
   parameters defined.  This memo extends [1] with additional colour
   sampling modes, to signal such video formats.

2.  Conventions Used in this Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].

3.  Payload Format Parameters

   This memo defines six new colour sampling modes that MAY be signalled
   for use with [1].  The new modes are "RGB+", "RG+B", "R+GB", "BGR+",
   "BG+R" and "B+GR".  These sampling modes use the same packing order
   of samples as do the RGB and BGR colour sampling modes respectively,
   except that an additional bit of colour depth is available for the
   component marked by the + symbol (i.e. when "depth=N" is signalled, N
   bits are allocated to unmarked components, but N+1 bits MUST be
   allocated to the marked component).  All other features of the
   payload format remain as defined in [1].

   The primary use of these colour sampling modes is to enable efficient
   packing of data into small pixel groups ("pgroups").  The most common
   use case is expected to be video with five bits per sample, where the
   additional bit of colour depth enables a single pixel to fit into two
   octets without padding.  The new colour sampling modes MAY be used
   for other depths, however, should that prove useful.

4.  Example

   A common uncompressed video format is RGB with 5 bits for the Red and
   Blue components and six bits for the Green component, for a total of
   16 bits per pixel.  Using the sampling modes defined in this memo,
   this can be signalled in SDP according to the following example:

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [1] apply.  No additional security
   considerations are introduced by support for new colour sampling
   modes.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The video/raw media type is extended with six new values for the
   "sampling" parameter according to the rules defined in section 6.2 of
   [1].  The new values are "RGB+", "RG+B", "R+GB", "BGR+", "BG+R" and
   "B+GR" as described in this memo.
