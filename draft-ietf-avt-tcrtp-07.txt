Abstract 
 
This document describes a method to improve the bandwidth utilization
of RTP streams over network paths that carry multiple Real-time
Transport Protocol (RTP) streams in parallel between two endpoints, as
in voice trunking. The method combines standard protocols that provide
compression, multiplexing, and tunneling over a network path to reduce
the bandwidth used when multiple RTP streams are carried over that
path.

This method was selected by the IETF Audio/Video Transport working
group as best satisfying the need for standardized RTP multiplexing
because it preserves full RTP semantics.  Other methods may be more
highly optimized for particular applications by constraining their
applicability, for example to a small set of encodings and a subset of
the RTP semantics.  Those other methods may be more appropriate as
proprietary protocols rather than standards.

1. Introduction 
 
  This document describes a way to combine existing protocols for 
  compression, multiplexing, and tunneling to save bandwidth for some 
  RTP applications. 
   
1.1. Is Bandwidth Costly? 
   
On certain links, such as customer access links, the cost of bandwidth 
is widely acknowledged to be a significant concern. Protocols such as 
CRTP [CRTP] are well suited to help bandwidth inefficiencies of 
protocols such as VoIP over these links. 
   
  Unacknowledged by many, however, is the cost of long-distance WAN 
  links.  While some voice-over-packet technologies such as Voice over 
  ATM (VoAAL2, [I.363.2]) and Voice over MPLS provide bandwidth 
  efficiencies because both technologies lack IP, UDP, and RTP headers, 
  neither VoATM nor VoMPLS provide direct access to voice-over-packet 
  services available to Voice over IP.  Thus, goals of WAN link cost 
  reduction are met at the expense of lost interconnection 
  opportunities to other networks. 
   
  TCRTP solves the VoIP bandwidth discrepency, especially for large 
  voice trunking applications. 
   
1.2. Overview of Protocols 
   
Header compression is accomplished using Enhanced CRTP (ECRTP) 
described in [RFCXXXX]. ECRTP is an enhancement to classical CRTP 
[CRTP] that works better over long delay links, such as the end-to-end 
tunneling links described in this document.  This header compression 
reduces the IP, UDP, and RTP headers. 
   
  Multiplexing is accomplished using PPP Multiplexing [PPP-MUX]. 
   
  Tunneling PPP is accomplished by using L2TP [L2TP]. 
   
  CRTP operates link-by-link; that is, to achieve compression over 
  multiple router hops, CRTP must be employed twice on each router -- 
  once on ingress, again on egress.  In contrast, TCRTP described in 
  this document does not require any additional per-router processing 
  to achieve header compression -- instead, headers are compressed end-
  to-end, saving bandwidth on all intermediate links. 

1.3. Document Focus
 
  This document is primarily concerned with bandwidth savings for Voice 
  over IP (VoIP) applications.  However, the combinations of protocols 
  described in this document can be used to provide similar bandwidth 
  savings for other RTP applications such as video. 
   
1.4. Enhanced CRTP 
 
  CRTP [CRTP] describes the use of RTP header compression on an 
  unspecified link layer transport, but typically PPP is used.  For 
  CRTP to compress headers, it must be implemented on each PPP link.  A 
  lot of context is required to successfully run CRTP, and memory and 
  processing requirements are high, especially if multiple hops must 
  implement CRTP to save bandwidth on each of the hops.  At higher line 
  rates, CRTP's processor consumption becomes prohibitively expensive. 
   
  A simplistic solution is to use CRTP with L2TP to achieve end-to-end 
  CRTP.  However, as described in [RFCXXXX], CRTP is only suitable for 
  links with low delay and low loss.

ROHC [ROHC] defines another header compression algorithm for
point-to-point links that is very efficient and robust against packet
loss.  While there is nothing in either PPP multiplexing or L2TP that
precludes the use of ROHC as the compression mechanism, ROHC does not
tolerate the misordering of compressed packets between the compressor
and decompressor that may occur when these packets are carried across
an IP tunnel.  Since the multiplexing method described in this
document uses IP tunnels, both packet loss and misordering may occur.
Therefore, the Enhanced CRTP algorithm specified in [RFCXXXX], which
includes optimizations to CRTP to deal with both packet loss and
misordering between the compressor and decompressor, is used instead.

See section 2.2 for details.
   
1.5. Reducing TCRTP Overhead 
   
  If only one stream is tunneled (L2TP) and compressed (ECRTP) there is 
  little bandwidth savings.  Multiplexing is helpful to amortize the 
  overhead of the tunnel header over many RTP payloads.  The 
  multiplexing format that is proposed by this document is PPP 
  multiplexing [PPP-MUX].  See section 2.3 for details. 
   
  [L2TP-HC] should be used to reduce the size of L2TP headers.  See 
  section 2.4 for details. 
   
2. Protocol Operation and Recommended Extensions 
 
  This section describes how to combine three protocols: Enhanced CRTP, 
  PPP Multiplexing, and L2TP Tunneling, to save bandwidth for RTP 
  applications such as Voice over IP. 
   
2.1. Models 
                          
  TCRTP can typically be implemented in two ways.  The most 
  straightforward is to implement TCRTP in the gateways terminating the 
  RTP streams: 
    
    [voice gateway]---[voice gateway] 
                    ^
                    | 
              TCRTP over IP 
   
  Another way TCRTP can be implemented is with an external 
  concentration device.  This device could be placed at strategic 
  places in the network and could dynamically create and destroy TCRTP 
  sessions without the participation of RTP-generating endpoints. 
   
    [voice gateway]\                                   /[voice gateway] 
    [voice gateway]---[concentrator]---[concentrator]---[voice gateway] 
    [voice gateway]/                                   \[voice gateway] 
                    ^                ^                ^ 
                    |                |                | 
               RTP over IP     TCRTP over IP     RTP over IP 
   
  Such a design also allows classical CRTP [CRTP] to be used on links 
  with only a few active flows per link (where TCRTP isn't efficient; 
  see section 3): 
   
    [voice gateway]\                                   /[voice gateway] 
    [voice gateway]---[concentrator]---[concentrator]---[voice gateway] 
    [voice gateway]/                                   \[voice gateway] 
                    ^                ^                ^ 
                    |                |                | 
              CRTP over IP     TCRTP over IP     RTP over IP 
   
   
2.2. Header Compression: ECRTP 
 
  As described in [RFCXXXX], classical CRTP [CRTP] is not suitable over 
  long-delay links such as the tunneling proposed by this document. 
  Thus, ECRTP should be used. 
   
2.2.1. Synchronizing ECRTP States 
 
  When the compressor receives an RTP packet which has an unpredicted 
  change in the RTP header, the compressor should send a 
  COMPRESSED_UDP packet (described in [RFCXXXX]) to synchronize the 
  ECRTP decompressor state.  The COMPRESSED_UDP packet updates the RTP 
  context in the decompressor. 
 
  To ensure delivery of updates of context variables, COMPRESSED_UDP 
  packets should be delivered using the robust operation described in 
  [RFCXXXX].  
 
As the "twice" algorithm described in [RFCXXXX] relies on UDP 
checksums, the IP stack on the RTP transmitter should transmit UDP 
checksums. If UDP checksums are not used, the ECRTP compressor should 
use the CRTP Headers checksum described in [RFCXXXX]. 
   
2.2.2. Out-of-Order Packets 
   
Tunneled transport does not guarantee in order delivery of packets. 
Therefore, the ECRTP decompressor must operate correctly in the 
presence of out of order packets. 
   
2.3. Multiplexing: PPP Multiplexing 
   
Both CRTP and ECRTP require a layer two protocol which allows 
identifying different protocols.  [PPP] is suited for this.

When CRTP is used inside of a tunnel, the header compression associated 
with CRTP will reduce the size of the IP, UDP, and IP headers of the IP 
packet carried in the tunnel. However, the tunnel itself has overhead 
due to its IP header and the tunnel header (the information necessary 
to identify the tunneled payload). One way to reduce the overhead of 
the IP header and tunnel header is to multiplex multiple RTP payloads 
in a single tunneled packet.

[PPP-MUX] describes an encapsulation that combines multiple PPP 
payloads into one multiplexed payload.  PPP multiplexing allows any 
supported PPP payload type to be multiplexed. This multiplexed frame is 
then carried as a single PPPMUX payload in the IP tunnel. This allows 
multiple RTP payloads to be carried in a single IP tunnel packet and 
allows the overhead of the uncompressed IP and tunnel headers to be 
amortized over multiple RTP payloads.

During PPP establishment of the TCRTP tunnel, only LCP and IPCP (for 
header compression) are required -- IP addresses do not need to be 
negotiated, nor is authentication necessary.  See section 4.1 for 
details. 
   
2.3.1. PPP Multiplex Transmitter Modifications for Tunneling   

Section 1.2 of [PPP-MUX] describes an example transmitter procedure 
that can be used to implement a PPP Multiplex transmitter. The 
transmission procedure described in this section includes a parameter 
MAX-SF-LEN that is used to limit the maximum size of a PPP Multiplex 
frame.

There are two reasons for limiting the size of a PPP Multiplex frame. 
First, a PPPMUX frame should never exceed the MRU of a physical link. 
Second, when a PPP session and its associated flow control are bound to 
a physical link, the MAX-SF-LEN parameter forms an upper limit on the 
amount of time a multiplex packet can be held before being transmitted. 
When flow control for the PPP Multiplex transmitter is bound to a 
physical link, the clock rate of the physical link can be used to pull 
frames from the PPP Multiplex transmitter. 

This type of flow control limits the maximum amount of time a PPP 
multiplex frame can be held before being transmitted to MAX-SF-LEN / 
Link Speed.

Tunnel interfaces are typically not bound to physical interfaces. 
Because of this, a tunnel interface has no well-known transmission rate 
associated with it. This means that flow control in the PPPMUX 
transmitter cannot rely on the clock of a physical link to pull frames 
from the multiplex transmitter. Instead, a timer must be used to limit 
the amount of time a PPPMUX frame can be held before being transmitted. 
The timer along with the MAX-SF-LEN parameter should be used to limit 
the amount of time a PPPMUX frame is held before being transmitted.

The following extensions to the PPPMUX transmitter logic should be made 
for use with tunnels. The flow control logic of the PPP transmitter 
should be modified to collect incoming payloads until one of two events 
has occurred: 

(1)  a specific number of octets, MAX-SF-LEN, has arrived at the    
multiplexer, or;

(2)  a timer, called T, has expired.

When either condition is satisfied, the multiplexed PPP payload is 
transmitted.

The purpose of MAX-SF-LEN is to ensure that a PPPMUX payload does not 
exceed the MTU size of any of the possible physical links that the 
tunnel can be associated with. The value of MAX-SF-LEN should be less 
than or equal to the minimum of MRU-2(maximum size of length field) and 
16,383 (14 bits) for all possible physical interfaces that the tunnel 
may be associated with.

The timer T provides an upper delay bound for tunnel interfaces. Timer 
T is reset whenever a multiplexed payload is sent to the next 
encapsulation layer.  The behavior of this timer is similar to AAL2's 
Timer_CU described in [I.363.2]. Each PPPMUX transmitter should have 
its own Timer T.

The optimal values for  T will vary depending upon the rate at which 
payloads are expected to arrive at the multiplexer and the delay budget 
for the multiplexing function.  For voice applications, the value of T 
would typically be 5-10 milliseconds.

2.3.2. Tunneling Inefficiencies 
   
  To get reasonable bandwidth efficiency using multiplexing within an 
  L2TP tunnel, multiple RTP streams should be active between the source 
  and destination of an L2TP tunnel. 
   
  If the source and destination of the L2TP tunnel are the same as the 
  source and destination of the ECRTP sessions, then the source and 
  destination must have multiple active RTP streams to get any benefit 
  from multiplexing.

  Because of this limitation, TCRTP is mostly useful for applications 
  where many RTP sessions run between a pair of RTP endpoints. The 
  number of simultaneous RTP sessions required to reduce the header 
  overhead to the desired level depends on the size of the L2TP header.
  A smaller L2TP header will result in fewer simultaneous RTP sessions 
  being required to produce bandwidth efficiencies similar to CRTP. 
   
2.4. Tunneling: L2TP 
 
  L2TP tunnels should be used to tunnel the ECRTP payloads end to end.  
  L2TP includes methods for tunneling messages used in PPP session 
  establishment such as NCP.  This allows [IPCP-HC] to negotiate ECRTP 
  compression/decompression parameters. 
   
2.4.1. Compressing L2TP headers 
   
  [L2TP-HC] describes a method of compressing L2TP tunnel headers from 
  36 octets (including the IP header) to 20 octets. L2TP Header 
  Compressed packets include an IP header with the L2TPHC protocol ID, 
  and omit the UDP and L2TP headers.  The result is the overhead of the 
  L2TP tunnel is only 20 octets. 
   
  L2TP header compression is negotiated during tunnel establishment.  
  Its use is recommended as it substantially increases the efficiency 
  of TCRTP. 
 
2.4.2. Tunneling and DiffServ 
   
  RTP streams may be marked with Expedited Forwarding (EF) bits, as 
  described in [EF-PHB].  When such a packet is tunneled, the tunnel 
  header must also be marked for the same EF bits, as required by [EF-
  PHB].  It is important to not mix EF and non-EF traffic in the same 
  EF-marked multiplexed tunnel. 

2.5. Encapsulation Formats 
 
  The packet format for an RTP packet compressed with RTP header 
  compression as defined in ECRTP is: 
 
     +---------+---------+-------------+-----------------------+ 
     |         |   MSTI  |             |                       | 
     | Context |         |     UDP     |                       | 
     |   ID    |   Link  |   Checksum  |       RTP Data        | 
     |         | Sequence|             |                       | 
     |  (1-2)  |   (1)   |     (0-2)   |                       | 
     +---------+---------+-------------+-----------------------+ 
 
   
  The packet format of a multiplexed PPP packet as defined by [PPP-MUX] 
  is: 
 
     +-------+---+------+-------+-----+   +---+------+-------+-----+ 
     | Mux   |P L|      |       |     |   |P L|      |       |     | 
     | PPP   |F X|Len1  |  PPP  |     |   |F X|LenN  |  PPP  |     | 
     | Prot. |F T|      | Prot. |Info1| ~ |F T|      | Prot. |InfoN| 
     | Field |          | Field1|     |   |          |FieldN |     | 
     | (1)   |1-2 octets| (0-2) |     |   |1-2 octets| (0-2) |     | 
     +-------+----------+-------+-----+   +----------+-------+-----+ 
 
 
  The format of an L2TP Header Compressed packet with a PPP payload as 
  defined by [L2TP-HC] is: 
 
     +-------------------+---------------------------------| 
     |  IP header        |      PPP payload                | 
     |    (20)           |                                 | 
     +-------------------+---------------------------------+ 
   
   
  The combined format used for TCRTP with a single payload is all of 
  the above packets concatenated.  Here is an example with one payload: 
 
     +------+-------+----------+-------+-------+-----+-------+----+ 
     | IP   | Mux   |P L|      |       |       | MSTI|       |    | 
     |header| PPP   |F X|Len1  |  PPP  |Context|     | UDP   |RTP | 
     | (20) | Proto |F T|      | Proto |  ID   | Link| Cksum |Data| 
     |      | Field |          | Field1|       | Seq |       |    | 
     |      | (1)   |1-2 octets| (0-2) | (1-2) | (1) | (0-2) |    | 
     +------+-------+----------+-------+-------+-----+-------+----+ 
            |<------------- IP payload ------------------------->| 
                    |<----- PPPmux payload --------------------->| 
   
  If the tunnel contains multiplexed traffic, multiple "PPPMux 
  payload"s are transmitted in one IP packet. 
   
3. Bandwidth Efficiency 
   
  The expected bandwidth efficiency attainable with TCRTP depends upon 
  a number of factors.  These factors include multiplexing gain, 
  expected packet loss rate across the network, and rates of change of 
  specific fields within the IP and RTP headers.  This section also
  describes how TCRTP significantly enhances bandwidth efficiency for 
  voice over IP over ATM. 
 
3.1. Multiplexing gains 
 
  Multiplexing reduces the overhead associated with the layer 2 and 
  tunnel headers.  Increasing the number of CRTP payloads combined into 
  one multiplexed PPP payload increases multiplexing gain.  As traffic 
  increases within a tunnel, more payloads are combined in one 
  multiplexed payload.  This will increase multiplexing gain. 
 
3.2. Packet loss rate 
 
  Loss of a multiplexed packet causes packet loss for all of the flows 
  within the multiplexed packet. 
   
When the expected loss rate in a tunnel is relatively low (less than 
perhaps 5%), the robust operation (described in [ECRTP]) should be 
sufficient to ensure delivery of state changes.  This robust operation 
is characterized by a parameter N which means that the probability of 
more than N adjacent packets getting lost on the tunnel is small.

  A value of N=1 will protect against the loss of a single packet 
within a compressed session at the expense of bandwidth.  A value of 
N=2 will protect against the loss of two packets in a row within a 
compressed session and so on.  Higher values of N have higher bandwidth 
penalties.

  The optimal value of N will depend on the loss rate in the tunnel.
   
  If the loss rate is high (above perhaps 5%) more advanced techniques 
  must be employed.  Those techniques are beyond the scope of this 
  document. 
   
3.3. Bandwidth Calculation for Voice Applications 
 
  The following formula uses the factors described above to model per-
  flow bandwidth usage.  These variables are defined: 
 
     SOV-TCRTP, unit: octet.  Per-payload overhead of ECRTP and the 
       multiplexed PPP header.  This value does not include additional 
       overhead for updating IP ID or the RTP Time Stamp fields (see 
       [RFCXXXX] for details on IP ID).  The value assumes the use of 
       the COMPRESSED_RTP payload type.  It consists of 1 octet for the 
       ECRTP context ID, 1 octet for COMPRESSED_RTP flags, 2 octets for 
       the UDP checksum, 1 octet for PPP protocol ID, and 1 octet for 
       the multiplexed PPP length field.  The total is 6 octets.

     POV-TCRTP, unit: octet.  Per-packet overhead of tunneled ECRTP.  
       This is the overhead for the tunnel header and the multiplexed 
       PPP payload type.  This value is 20 octets for the IP header, 
       and 1 octet for the multiplexed PPP protocol ID. The total is 21 
       octets.   
      
     TRANSMIT-LENGTH, unit: milliseconds.  The average duration of a 
       transmission (such as a talk spurt for voice streams). 
        
     SOV-TSTAMP, unit: octet.  Additional per-payload overhead of the 
       COMPRESSED_UDP header that includes the absolute time stamp 
       field.  This value includes 1 octet for the extra flags field in
       the COMPRESSED_UDP header and 4 octets for the absolute time 
       stamp for a total of 5 octets. 
      
     SOV-IPID, unit: octet.  Additional per-payload overhead of the 
       COMPRESSED_UDP header that includes the absolute IPID field.  
       This value includes 2 octets for the absolute IPID.  This value 
       also includes 1 octet for the extra flags field in the 
       COMPRESSED_UDP header.  The total is 3 octets. 
      
     IPID-RATIO, unit: integer values 0 or 1.  Indicates the frequency 
       at which IPID will be updated by the compressor. If IPID is 
       changing randomly and thus always needs to be updated, then the
       value is 1. If IPID is changing by a fixed constant amount 
       between payloads of a flow, then IPID-RATIO will be 0. The value
       of this variable does not consider the IPID value at the 
       beginning of a voice talk spurts, as that is considered by the 
       variable TRANSMIT-LENGTH. The implementation of the sending 
       IP stack and RTP application controls this behavior. 
       See section 1.1. 
      
     NREP, unit: integer (usually a number between 1 and 3).  This is 
       the number of times an update field will be repeated in ECRTP 
       headers to increase the delivery rate between the compressor and 
       decompressor.  For this example, we will assume NREP=2.  
      
     PAYLOAD-SIZE, unit: octets. The size of the RTP payload in octets.
      
     MUX-SIZE, unit: count.  The number of PPP payloads multiplexed 
       into one multiplexed PPP payload. 
      
     SAMPLE-PERIOD, unit: milliseconds.  The average delay between 
       transmissions of a voice payload for all calls in the 
       multiplex.  The value of this variable is 10ms if all calls 
       have a 10ms sample period. 

  The formula is: 
 
     SOV-TOTAL = SOV-TCRTP + SOV-TSTAMP * (NREP * SAMPLE-PERIOD / 
       TRANSMIT-LENGTH) + SOV-IPID * IPID-RATIO 
      
     BANDWIDTH = ((PAYLOAD-SIZE + SOV-TOTAL + (POV-TCRTP / MUX-SIZE)) * 
       8) / SAMPLE-PERIOD) 
   
  The results are: 
   
     BANDWIDTH, unit: kilobits per second.  The average amount of 
       bandwidth used per call. 
      
     SOV-TOTAL = The total amount of per-payload overhead associated 
       with tunneled ECRTP.  It includes the per-payload overhead of 
       ECRTP and PPP, timestamp update overhead, and IPID update 
       overhead. 
   
3.3.1. Bandwidth Calculation Example 
   
  To create an example using the above formulas, we will assume the 
  following usage scenario.  Compressed voice streams using G.729 
  compression with a 20 millisecond packetization period.  In this 
  scenario, VAD is enabled and the average talk spurt length is 1500 
  milliseconds.  The IPID field is changing randomly between payloads 
  of streams.  There is enough traffic in the tunnel to allow 3 
  multiplexed payloads.  The following values apply: 
   
     SAMPLE-PERIOD      = 20 milliseconds 
     TRANSMIT-LENGTH    = 1500 milliseconds 
     IPID-RATIO         = 1 
     PAYLOAD-SIZE       = 20 octets 
     MUX-SIZE           = 3 
   
  For this example, per call bandwidth is 14.4 kbits/sec.  Classical 
  CRTP over a single HDLC link using the same factors as above yields 
  12.4 kbits/sec. 
 
  The effect of IPID can have a large effect on per call bandwidth.  If 
  the above example is recalculated using an IPID-RATIO of 0, then the 
  per call bandwidth is reduced to 13.2 kbits/sec.  Classical CRTP over 
  a single HDLC link using these same factors yields 11.2 kbits/call. 
   
3.3.2. Bandwidth Comparison Table 
   
  Using 5 simultaneous calls, no voice activity detection (VAD), G.729 
  with 20ms packetization interval, not considering RTCP overhead: 
   
    Normal VoIP over PPP:            124kbps 
    with classical CRTP on a link:    50kbps (savings: 59%) 
    with TCRTP over PPP:              56kbps (savings: 55%) 
    with TCRTP over AAL5:             85kbps (savings: 31%) 
 
3.3.3. Voice over IP over ATM 
 
  IP transport over AAL5 causes a quantizing effect to bandwidth 
  utilization due to the packets always being multiples of ATM cells. 
 
  For example, the payload size for G.729 using 10 millisecond 
  packetization interval is 10 octets.  This is much smaller than the 
  payload size of an ATM cell (48 octets).  When classical CRTP [CRTP] 
  is used on a link-by-link basis, the IP overhead to payload ratio is 
  quite good.  However, AAL5 encapsulation and its cell padding always 
  force the minimum payload size to be one ATM cell, which results in 
  poor bandwidth utilization. 
 
  Instead of wasting this padding, the multiplexing of TCRTP allows 
  this previously wasted space in the ATM cell to contain useful data. 
  This is one of the main reasons why multiplexing has such a large 
  effect on bandwidth utilization with Voice over IP over ATM. 
   
  This multiplexing efficiency of TCRTP is similar to AAL2 sub-cell 
  multiplexing described in [I.363.1].  Unlike AAL2 sub-cell 
  multiplexing, however, TCRTP's multiplexing efficiency isn't limited 
  to only ATM networks. 
   
   
3.3.4. Voice over IP over non-ATM networks 
                       
  When TCRTP is used with other layer 2 encapsulations that do not have 
  a minimum PDU size, the benefit of multiplexing is not as great.  
 
  Depending upon the exact overhead of the layer 2 encapsulation, the 
  benefit of VOIP multiplexing might be slightly better or worse than 
  link-by-link CRTP header compression.  The per-payload overhead of 
  CRTP tunneling is either 4 or 6 octets. If classical CRTP plus layer 
  2 overhead is greater than this amount, TCRTP multiplexing will 
  consume less bandwidth than classical CRTP when the outer IP header 
  is amortized over a large number of payloads. 
 
  The payload breakeven point can be determined by the following 
  formula: 
   
    POV-L2 * MUX-SIZE >= POV-L2 + POV-TUNNEL + 
                         POV-PPPMUX + SOV-PPPMUX * MUX-SIZE 
                                  
  Where: 
   
     POV-L2, unit: octet.  Layer 2 packet overhead: 5 octets for HDLC 
       encapsulation  
      
     POV-TUNNEL, unit: octet.  Packet overhead due to tunneling: 20 
       octets IP header 
      
     POV-PPPMUX, unit: octet.  Packet overhead for the multiplexed PPP 
       protocol ID: 1 octet 
      
     SOV-PPPMUX, unit: octet.  Per-payload overhead of PPPMUX, which is 
       comprised of the payload length field and the ECRTP protocol ID.
       The value of SOV-PPPMUX is typically 1, 2, or 3. 
      
  If using HDLC as the layer 2 protocol, the breakeven point using the 
  above formula is when MUX-SIZE = 6.  Thus 6 voice calls need to be 
  multiplexed to make TCRTP bandwidth-efficient. 
 
 
4. Example implementation of TCRTP 
 
  This section describes an example implementation of TCRTP. 
  Implementations of TCRTP may be done in many ways as long as the 
  requirements of the associated RFCs are met. 
 
Here is the path an RTP packet takes in this implementation:

   A protocol stack is configured to create an L2TP tunnel interface to 
  a destination host.  The tunnel is configured to negotiate the PPP 
  connection (using NCP IPCP) with ECRTP header compression and PPPMUX. 
  IP forwarding is configured to route RTP packets to this tunnel.  The 
  destination UDP port number could distinguish RTP packets from non-
  RTP packets. 
 
  The transmitting application gathers the RTP data from one source, 
  and formats an RTP packet. Lower level application layers add UDP and 
  IP headers to form a complete IP packet. 
 
  The RTP packets are routed to the tunnel interface where headers are 
  compressed, payloads multiplexed, and then tunneled to the 
  destination host. 
  
  The operation of the receiving node is the same as the transmitting 
  node in reverse.

5. IANA Considerations

  This document does not require any assignments from IANA.


6. Security Considerations 
  
This document describes a method for combining several existing
protocols implementing compression, multiplexing, and tunneling of RTP
streams.  Attacks on the component technologies of TCRTP include
attacks on RTP/RTCP headers and payloads carried within a TCRTP
session, attacks on the compressed headers, attacks on the
multiplexing layer, or attacks on the tunneling negotiation or
transport.  The security issues associated individually with each of
those component technologies are addressed in their respective
specifications, [RFCXXXX], [PPP-MUX], [L2TP], and [L2TP-HC], along
with the security considerations for RTP itself [RTP].

However, there may be additional security considerations arising from
the use of these component technologies together.  For example, there
may be an increased risk of unintended misdelivery of packets from one
stream in the multiplex to another due to a protocol malfunction or
data error because the addressing information is more condensed. This 
is particularly true if the tunnel is transmitted over a link-layer
protocol that allows delivery of packets containing bit errors in
combination with a tunnel transport layer option that does not
checksum all of the payload.

The opportunity for malicious misdirection may be increased relative
to that for a single RTP stream transported by itself because
addressing information must be unencrypted for the header compression
and multiplexing layers to function.

The primary defense against misdelivery is to make the data unusable
to unintended recipients through cryptographic techniques.  The basic
method for encryption provided in the RTP specification [RTP] is not
suitable because it encrypts the RTP and RTCP headers along with the
payload.  However, the RTP specification also allows alternative
approaches to be defined in separate profile or payload format
specifications wherein only the payload portion of the packet would be
encrypted so header compression may be applied to the encrypted
packets.  One such profile is currently being developed [SRTP] to
provide more sophisticated and complete methods for encryption and
message authentication than the basic approach in [RTP].  Additional
methods may be developed in the future.  Appropriate cryptographic
protection should be incorporated into all TCRTP applications.
