1.  Introduction

   Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation (MAP-E) [RFC7597] is a
   stateless, automatic tunnelling mechanism for providing an IPv4
   connectivity service to end-users over a service provider's IPv6
   network.

   This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with monitoring MAP-E devices.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in
   [RFC2578], [RFC2579] and [RFC2580].

3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals,
   as shown here.

4.  Structure of the MIB Module

   The Interfaces MIB [RFC2863] defines generic managed objects for
   managing interfaces.  Each logical interface (physical or virtual)
   has an ifEntry.  Tunnels are handled by creating a logical interface
   (ifEntry) for each tunnel.  Each MAP-E tunnel endpoint also acts as a
   virtual interface that has a corresponding entry in the Interface
   MIB.  Those corresponding entries are indexed by ifIndex.  MAP-E MIB
   is configurable on a per-interface basis, so it depends on several
   parts (ifEntry) of the IF-MIB[RFC2863].

4.1.  The mapMIBObjects

4.1.1.  The mapRule Subtree

   The mapRule subtree describes managed objects used for managing the
   multiple mapping rules in MAP-E.

   According to the [RFC7597], the mapping rules are divided into two
   categories, which are Basic Mapping Rule (BMR), and Forwarding
   Mapping Rule (FMR).  And according to the section 4.1 of [RFC7598],
   it defines a F-flag to specify whether the rule is to be used for
   forwarding (FMR).  If set, this rule is used as an FMR; if not set,
   this rule is a BMR only and MUST NOT be used for forwarding.  And a
   BMR can also be used as an FMR for forwarding if the F-flag is set.
   So in the RuleType definition of MAP-E MIB in section 5, it defines
   bmrAndfmr to specify this scenario.

4.1.2.  The mapSecurityCheck Subtree

   The mapSecurityCheck subtree provides statistics for the number of
   invalid packets that have been identified.  There are two kinds of
   invalid packets which are defined in the [RFC7597] as below.

   - The Border Relay (BR) will validate the received packet's source
   IPv6 address against the configured MAP domain rule and the
   destination IPv6 address against the configured BR IPv6 address.

Internet-Draft       draft-ietf-softwire-map-mib-12             May 2018


   - The MAP node (Customer Edge, CE and BR) will check that the
   received packets' source IPv4 address and port is in the range
   derived from the matching MAP Rule.

4.2.  The mapMIBConformance Subtree

   The mapMIBConformance subtree provides conformance information of MIB
   objects.

5.  Definitions

   The following MIB module imports definitions from [RFC2578],
   [RFC2579], [RFC2580], [RFC2863], and [RFC4001].

6.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

         Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
         ----------        -----------------------
         MAP-E-MIB          { mib-2 XXX }

7.  Security Considerations

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.

   Some of the MIB model's objects are vulnerable as the information
   which they hold may be used for targeting an attack against a MAP
   node (CE or BR).  E.g., an intruder could use the information to help
   deduce the customer IPv4 and IPv6 topologies and address-sharing
   ratios in use by the ISP.

   The following is a list of the objects that have this vulnerability:

      mapRuleIPv6Prefix

      mapRuleIPv6PrefixLen

      mapRuleIPv4Prefix

      mapRuleIPv4PrefixLen

      mapRuleBRIPv6Address

      mapRulePSID

      mapRulePSIDLen

      mapRuleOffset

      mapRuleEALen

      mapRuleType

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
