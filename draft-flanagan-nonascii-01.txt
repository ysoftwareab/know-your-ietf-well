                The Use of Non-ASCII Characters in RFCs
                       draft-flanagan-nonascii-01

Abstract

   In order to support the internationalization of protocols and a more
   diverse Internet community, the RFC Series must evolve to allow for
   the use of non-ASCII characters in RFCs.  While English remains the
   accepted language of the Series, the encoding of future RFCs will be
   in UTF-8.  This document describes the RFC Editor requirements and
   guidance regarding the use of non-ASCII characters in RFCs.

   This document updates [draft-iab-styleguide].

1.  Introduction

   For much of the history of the RFC Series, the character encoding
   used for RFCs has been ASCII [ASCII].  This was a sensible choice at
   the time: the language of the Series is English, a language that only
   uses ASCII-encoded characters (ignoring for a moment words borrowed
   from more richly decorated alphabets); and, ASCII is the "lowest
   common denominator" for character encoding, making cross-platform
   viewing trivial.

   There are limits ASCII, however, that hinder its continued use as the
   exclusive character encoding for the Series.  The increasing need for
   easily readable, internationalized content suggests it is time to
   allow non-ASCII characters in RFCs where necessary.  To support this
   move away from ASCII, RFCs will switch to supporting UTF-8 as the
   default character encoding [STD63].  UTF-8 has seen widespread
   acceptance by authors, publishers, and code developers across the
   Internet, is backwards-compatible with ASCII, and is the default
   encoding for XML (the new canonical format of RFCs) [RFC6949].

   Given the continuing goal of maximum readability across platforms,
   the use of non-ASCII characters should be limited in a document to
   only where necessary within the text.  This document describes the
   rules under which non-ASCII characters may be used in an RFC.  These
   rules will be applied as the necessary changes are made to submission
   checking and editorial tools.

2.  Basic requirements

   Two fundamental requirements inform the guidance and examples
   provided in this document.  They are:

   o Searches against RFC indexes and database tables need to return
   expected results and support appropriate Unicode string matching
   behaviors;

   o RFCs must be able to display correctly across a wide range of
   readers and browsers.  People whose system does not have the fonts
   needed to display a particular RFC need to be able to read the non-
   canonical HTML, text, or PDF RFC correctly.

3.  Rules for the use of non-ASCII characters

   This section describes the guidelines for the use of non-ASCII
   characters in the header, body, and reference sections of an RFC.  If
   the RFC Editor identifies areas where the use of non-ASCII characters
   negatively impacts the readability of the text, they will request
   alternate text.

   The RFC Editor may, in cases of entire words represented in non-ASCII
   characters, ask for a set of reviewers to verify the meaning,
   spelling, characters, and grammar of the text.

3.1.  General usage throughout a document

   Where the use of non-ASCII characters is purely as part of an example
   and not otherwise required for correct protocol operation, escaping
   the Unicode character is not required.  Note, however, that as the
   language of the RFC Series is English, the use of non-ASCII
   characters is based on the spelling of words commonly used in the
   English language following the guidance in the Merriam-Webster
   dictionary [MerrWeb].

   The RFC Editor will use the primary spelling listed in the dictionary
   by default.

   Example of non-ASCII characters that do not require escaping
   [RFC4475]:

   This particular response contains unreserved and non-ascii UTF-8
   characters.  This response is well formed.  A parser must accept this
   message.

3.2.  Authors, Contributors, and Acknowledgments

   Person names may appear in several places within an RFC.  In all
   cases, valid Unicode is required.  For names that include non-ASCII
   characters, an author-provided, ASCII-only identifier is required to
   assist in search and indexing of the document.

   Example for the header:

   Cat Enterprises BCP: 33 D. van Gulik Category: Best Current Practice
   ISIS/CEO, JRC Ispra R. Iannella DSTC Pty Ltd P. Faeltstroem (P.

   Example for the Acknowledgements:

   OLD: The following people contributed significant text to early
   versions of this draft: Patrik Faltstrom, William Chan, and Fred
   Baker.

   &#38472;&#26234;&#26124; (William Chan), and Fred Baker.

3.3.  Company Names

   Company names may appear in several places within an RFC.  The rules
   for company names follow similar guidance to that of person names.
   Valid Unicode is required.  For company names that include non-ASCII
   characters, an ASCII-only identifier is required to assist in search
   and indexing of the document.

3.4.  Body of the document

   When the mention of non-ASCII characters is required for correct
   protocol operation and understanding, the characters' Unicode
   character name or code point MUST be included in the text.

   o Non-ASCII characters will require identifying the Unicode code
   point.

   o Use of the actual UTF-8 character (e.g., &#916;) is encouraged so
   that a reader can more easily see what the character is, if their
   device can render the text.

   o The use of the Unicode character names like "INCREMENT" in addition
   to the use of Unicode code points is also encouraged.
   When used, Unicode character names should be in all capital letters.

   Examples:

   OLD [draft-ietf-precis-framework]: However, the problem is made more
   serious by introducing the full range of Unicode code points into
   protocol strings.  For example, the characters U+13DA U+13A2 U+13B5
   U+13AC U+13A2 U+13AC U+13D2 from the Cherokee block look similar to
   the ASCII characters "STPETER" as they might appear when presented
   using a "creative" font family.

   NEW/ALLOWED: However, the problem is made more serious by introducing
   the full range of Unicode code points into protocol strings.  For
   example, the characters U+13DA U+13A2 U+13B5 U+13AC U+13A2 U+13AC
   U+13D2 (&#5082;&#5026;&#5045;&#5036;&#5026;&#5036;&#5074;) from the
   Cherokee block look similar to the ASCII characters "STPETER" as they
   might appear when presented using a "creative" font family.

   ALSO ACCEPTABLE: However, the problem is made more serious by
   introducing the full range of Unicode code points into protocol
   strings.  For example, the characters
   "&#5082;&#5026;&#5045;&#5036;&#5026;&#5036;&#5074; " (U+13DA U+13A2
   U+13B5 U+13AC U+13A2 U+13AC U+13D2) from the Cherokee block look
   similar to the ASCII characters "STPETER" as they might appear when
   presented using a "creative" font family.

   Example of proper identification of Unicode characters in an RFC:

   Acceptable:

   Temperature changes in the Temperature Control Protocol are indicated
   by the U+0394 character.

Internet-Draft               Non-ASCII RFCs                   April 2014


   Preferred:

   (a) Temperature changes in the Temperature Control Protocol are
   indicated by the U+2206 character ("&#916;").

   (b) Temperature changes in the Temperature Control Protocol are
   indicated by the U+2206 character (INCREMENT).

   (c) Temperature changes in the Temperature Control Protocol are
   indicated by the U+2206 character ("&#916;", INCREMENT).

   (d) Temperature changes in the Temperature Control Protocol are
   indicated by the U+2206 character (INCREMENT, "&#916;").

   (e) Temperature changes in the Temperature Control Protocol are
   indicated by the [Delta] character "&#916;" (U+2206).

   (f) Temperature changes in the Temperature Control Protocol are
   indicated by the character "&#916;" (INCREMENT, U+2206).

   Which option of (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), or (f) is preferred may
   depend on context and the specific character(s) in question.  All are
   acceptable within an RFC.  BCP 137, "ASCII Escaping of Unicode
   Character" describes the pros and cons of different options for
   identifying Unicode characters in an ASCII document [BCP137].

3.5.  Tables

   Tables follow the same rules for identifiers and characters as in
   "Section 3.4 Body of the document".  If it is sensible (i.e., more
   understandable for a reader) for a given document to have two tables
   - one including the identifiers and non-ASCII characters and a second
   with just the non-ASCII characters - that will be allowed on a case-
   by-case basis.

   Example: TBD

3.6.  Code components

   The RFC Editor encourages the use of the U+ notation except within a
   code component where you must follow the rules of the programming
   language in which you are writing the code.

   Example:

   TBD

3.7.  Bibliographic text

   The reference entry must be in English; whatever subfields are
   present must be available in ASCII-encoded characters.  As long as
   good sense is used, the reference entry may also include non-ASCII
   characters at the author's discretion and as provided by the author.
   The RFC Editor will request a review of the non-ASCII reference
   entry.

   This applies to both normative and informative references.

   Example: [GOST3410]  "Information technology.  Cryptographic data
   security.  Signature and verification processes of [electronic]
   digital signature.", GOST R 34.10-2001, Gosudarstvennyi Standard of

3.8.  Keywords

   Keywords must be ASCII only.

3.9.  Address Information

   The purpose of providing address information, either postal or
   e-mail, is to assist readers of an RFC to contact the author or
   authors.  Authors may include the official postal address as
   recognized by their company or local postal service without
   additional non-ASCII character escapes.  If the email address

   includes non-ASCII characters and is a valid email address at the
   time of publication, non-ASCII character escapes are not required.

4.  Normalization Forms

   Authors should not expect normalization forms to be preserved.  If a
   particular normalization form is expected, note that in the text of
   the RFC.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.

6.  Internationalization Considerations

   The ability to use non-ASCII characters in RFCs in a clear and
   consistent manner will improve the ability to describe
   internationalized protocols and will recognize the diversity of
   authors.

7.  Security Considerations

   Valid Unicode that matches the expected text must be verified in
   order to preserve expected behavior and protocol information.
