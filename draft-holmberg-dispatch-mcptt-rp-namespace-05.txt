1.  Introduction

   The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has defined a Mission
   Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT) over LTE service [TS.3GPP.22.179] . The
   MCPTT service supports an enhanced PTT service, suitable for mission
   critical scenarios, based upon 3GPP Evolved Packet System (EPS)
   services.  The requirements for the MCPTT service defined within 3GPP
   can also form the basis for a non-mission critical Push To Talk (PTT)
   service.

   The MCPTT service is intended to support communication between
   several users (a group call), where each user can gain permission to
   talk in an arbitrated manner.  However, the MCPTT service also
   supports private calls between pairs of users.

   MCPTT is primarily targeted to provide a professional Push To Talk
   service to e.g., public safety, transport companies, utilities or
   industrial and nuclear plants.  In addition to this, a commercial PTT
   service for non-professional use (e.g., groups of people on holiday)
   may be delivered through an MCPTT system.  Based on their operational
   model, the performance and MCPTT features in use vary per user
   organization, where functionality which is more mission critical
   specific (e.g., Imminent Peril Call) might not be available to
   commercial customers.

   The MCPTT service provides its users with different priorities for
   the access to network resources in order to provide means to
   prioritize between calls when resources are scarce.  These priorities
   take into account among other things the priority and role of the
   caller, the priority and type of the group, and the situation in
   which the call is made.

   The SIP level call control procedures using these namespaces are
   specified in [TS.3GPP.24.379].  The namespaces defined here will

Internet-Draft             MCPTT R-P namespace              January 2017


   support a wide range of queuing options.  The namespaces correspond
   to what can be supported over the 3GPP Rx interface, defined in
   [TS.3GPP.29.214].  The usage of the namespaces can be tailored to the
   needs of the operator.  The mechanism to do this is to configure
   which values a specific user is allowed to use.  This configuration
   is specified in [TS.3GPP.24.384].

   High priority calls when there is danger of life, for either the
   public safety worker or any other human, need to be set up
   immediately and thus require preemption.  Other calls may be less
   sensitive in call set-up time but have a high priority once
   established.  For these calls a queueing mechanism is more
   appropriate.  The MCPTT data transfer service currently under
   development can benefit from a queueing mechanism.  Another example
   is video only calls that are not critical in call set-up time, but
   where keeping the call is important.

   This document creates additional Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   Resource-Priority namespaces to meet the requirements of the 3GPP
   defined Mission Critical Push To Talk, and places these namespaces in
   the IANA registry.

2.  Applicability

   This document defines namespaces applicable for MCPTT services
   defined by 3GPP that use the network services of a 3GPP defined LTE
   network.  The use of this namespace outside such networks is
   undefined.

3.  New SIP Resource-Priority Namespaces Created

3.1.  Introduction

   This document introduces the MCPTT namespaces mcpttp and mcpttq, the
   name coming from the 3GPP defined Mission Critical Push To Talk
   service.

3.2.  The MCPTT namespaces

   The mcpttp namespace uses the priority levels listed below from
   lowest to highest priority.

      mcpttp.0 (lowest priority)
      mcpttp.1
      mcpttp.2
      mcpttp.3
      mcpttp.4
      mcpttp.5

      mcpttp.12
      mcpttp.13
      mcpttp.14
      mcpttp.15 (highest priority)

   Intended algorithm for mcpttp is preemption.

   New Warning code: No.

   New SIP response code: No.

   The mcpttq namespace uses the priority levels listed below from
   lowest to highest priority.

      mcpttq.0 (lowest priority)
      mcpttq.1
      mcpttq.2
      mcpttq.3
      mcpttq.4

      mcpttq.12
      mcpttq.13
      mcpttq.14
      mcpttq.15 (highest priority)

   Intended algorithm for mcpttq is queuing.

   New Warning code: No.

   New SIP response code: No.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not have any impact on the security of the SIP
   MCPTT protocol.  Its purpose is purely administrative in nature.

5.  IANA Considerations

   Abiding by the rules established within [RFC4412] and [RFC7134] ,
   this is an Informative RFC creating two new namespaces, their
   associated priority-values, and intended algorithms.
