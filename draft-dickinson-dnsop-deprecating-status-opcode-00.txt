1.  Introduction

   The Status OpCode was given the value of 2 in [RFC1035].  However, no
   RFC defines what it means or how it should be used.  This document
   makes the Status OpCode obsolete.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Implementation Status

   To the author's knowledge there is no implementation of the Status
   OpCode.  A quick test shows inconsistent responses to a Status
   request with different DNS server implementations returning NotImp,
   Refused or giving no response at all.

4.  Depreciating the Status OpCode

   The Status OpCode MUST be marked OBSOLETE.

   The correct response to the Status OpCode MUST be NotImp.

5.  Security Considerations

   None

6.  IANA Considerations

   This documents updates the IANA registry "Domain Name System (DNS)
   Parameters OpCode registry" [DNS-IANA].

              +--------+-------------------+---------------+
              | OpCode | Name              | Reference     |
              +--------+-------------------+---------------+
              | 2      | Status (OBSOLETE) | This Document |
              +--------+-------------------+---------------+

7.  Acknowledgments

   Thanks to Mark Andrews, Matt Pounsett, Roy Arends and all the people
   at IETF 104 that I asked if they knew of any usage of this OpCode.
   Also thanks to Shane Kerr for reminding me to write this document.
