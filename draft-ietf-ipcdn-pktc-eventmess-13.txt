1.   The Internet-Standard Management Framework 
 
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current 
Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of 
RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
 
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally 
accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). 
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the 
Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a 
MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 
58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 
2580 [RFC2580].

PacketCable/IPCablecom Event management MTA MIB              June 2008 
 
 
A multimedia terminal adapter (MTA) is used to deliver broadband 
Internet, data, and/or voice access jointly with telephony service 
to a subscriber's or customer's premises using a cable network 
infrastructure. A MTA is normally installed at the customer's or 
subscriber's premises, and it is coupled to a multiple system 
operator (MSO) using a hybrid fiber coax (HFC) access network. 
 
A MTA is provisioned by the MSO for broadband Internet, data, and/or 
voice service. For more information on MTA provisioning refer to 
[PKT-SP-PROV] and [RFC4682]. MTA devices include one or more 
endpoints (e.g., telephone ports) which receive call signaling 
information to establish ring cadence, and codecs used for providing 
telephony service.  
 
For more information on call signaling refer to [PKT-SP-MGCP] and 
[RFC3435].  
 
For more information on codecs refer to [PKT-SP-CODEC]. 
 
Given the complexity of such systems it is important that a suitable 
event management mechanism be defined to allow for effective 
management. This MIB module provides objects suitable for generation 
and management of events on the MTA.  
 
3.   Terminology 
 
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 
 
The terms "MIB module" and "information module" are used 
interchangeably in this memo.  As used here, both terms refer to any 
of the three types of information modules defined in Section 3 of 
RFC 2578 [RFC2578]. Some of the terms used in this memo are defined  
below.  Some additional terms are also defined in the 
PacketCable(TM) 
Management Event Mechanism Specification [PKT-SP-MEM1.5] and the  
PacketCable MTA Device Provisioning Specification [PKT-SP-PROV]. 
 
3.1    PacketCable  
PacketCable is a CableLabs-led initiative that is aimed at 
developing interoperable interface specifications for delivering 
advanced, real-time multimedia services over two-way cable plants. 
 
3.2    IPCableCom 
IPCableCom is an ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector  
(ITU-T) project that includes architecture and a series of 
recommendations that enable the delivery of real time services over 
the cable television networks using cable modems.

3.3    MTA 
 
A Multimedia Terminal Adapter (MTA) is a PacketCable or IPCablecom 
compliant device providing telephony services over a cable or hybrid 
system used to deliver video signals to a community. It contains an 
interface to endpoints, a network interface, codecs, and all 
signaling and encapsulation functions required for Voice over IP 
transport, call signaling, and Quality of Service signaling. A MTA 
can be an embedded or a standalone device. An Embedded MTA (E-MTA) 
is a MTA device containing an embedded Data Over Cable Service 
Interface Specifications (DOCSIS) Cable Modem. A Standalone MTA  
(S-MTA) is a MTA device separated from the DOCSIS Cable Modem by 
non-DOCSIS MAC interface (e.g., Ethernet, USB). 
 
3.4    Endpoint 
An endpoint or MTA endpoint is a standard RJ-11 telephony physical 
port located on the MTA and used for attaching the telephone device 
to the MTA. 
 
 
3.5     MSO  
Multi-System Operator. A cable company that operates many head-end 
locations in several cities.  
   
 
3.6    UDP  
User Datagram Protocol. A connectionless protocol built upon 
Internet Protocol (IP), as per RFC 768 [RFC768].  
  
 
4.   Overview  
 
PacketCable, European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), 
and International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication 
Standardization Sector (ITU-T) IPCablecom compliant  
Multimedia Terminal Adaptors (MTAs) are required to generate 
management events upon the occurrence of certain operational 
conditions. For instance, "AC power failure, MTA operational on 
battery power". The complete set of conditions and the corresponding 
management events to be generated are specified in [PKT-SP-MEM1.5], 
[ETSITS101909-22] and [ITU-T-J176], respectively. In addition, the 
MTA manufacturer is allowed to specify vendor-specific management 
events. For example, vendor XYZ can specify "Memory read error, 
terminating process, code: XYZ123".  
 
When management events are generated, they can either be stored in a 
local log on the MTA, or transmitted using two possible mechanisms: 
SNMP and syslog. This is required to be configurable and manageable

PacketCable/IPCablecom Event management MTA MIB              June 2008 
 
 
by the management station for each management event (default values 
can be provided when the events are defined). This Internet-Draft 
proposes a MIB that can provide for configuration and management of 
such management events. A means to log the events is provided within 
the specified MIB module. For syslog as a transport, the necessary 
information (format, transport etc.) is also specified. For SNMP as 
a transport, the MIB objects specified in the SNMP-TARGET-MIB and 
SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB as utilized, as specified in [RFC3413]. 
 
Further, each management event can be uniquely identified using the 
'Organization ID' and an 'Event ID'. The 'Organization ID' is the 
enterprise ID of the organization specifying the event (e.g., 4491 
for CableLabs) and a unique identifier that identifies the event. 
The 'Event ID' is an identifier that uniquely identifies the event 
within the 'Organization ID' space. This Internet-Draft does not 
specify any management events. It only provides a mechanism to 
manage the storage and transmission of events. 
 
The EVENT MIB module specified in this document is intended to 
update the EVENT MIB modules from which it is partly derived: 
  - the PacketCable 1.5 Management Event MIB Specification  
    [PKT-SP-EVEMIB1.5], 
  - the ITU-T IPCablecom management event mechanism MIB requirements 
[ITU-T-J176]  
 
Several normative and informative references are used to help define 
Management Event MIB objects.  As a convention, wherever the 
requirements are equivalent at the time of the writing, the 
PacketCable reference is used. However, MTA implementations MUST 
refer to the corresponding specifications to ensure compliance. 
 
4.1    Structure of the MIB  
 
The Management Event MIB module is identified by pktcIetfEventMib 
and is structured into the following sub-trees: 
 
- pktcEventControl specifies the management information pertinent to 
control of the device's event generation capabilities.  
 
- pktcEventThrottle specifies the management information pertinent 
to throttling the transmission of management events using syslog or 
SNMP. 
 
- pktcEventStatus specifies the management information for the 
device to report status information related to the generated events. 
 
- pktcEvents specifies the management information for the device to 
list all the events it is capable of generating.

PacketCable/IPCablecom Event management MTA MIB              June 2008 
 
 
- pktcEventLog specifies the management information for the device 
to store the generated events. 
 
- pktcEventNotifications specifies the management information that 
defines the SNMP trap and inform messages.  
 
4.2    pktcEventControl  
The group of objects in this sub-tree provide for three important 
controls: ability to reset the event logs and event descriptions, 
syslog configuration and event classes.  
 
Some highlights are as follows: 
 
pktcEventReset - this MIB object allows a management station to 
reset the event logs, the event descriptions, or both. 
 
 
pktcEventSyslog - this group of MIB objects allow the management 
station to provide information for transmission of events to a 
syslog server, such as message formats and transport protocols. 
 
 
pktcEventClassTable - this MIB table allows for MTAs to classify the 
management events into different categories, termed 'event classes'. 
It then allows for common operations to be affected across all the 
events pertaining to a specific event class. 
 
 
 
4.3    pktcEventThrottle  
As indicated earlier, the generated events can be stored locally, or 
transmitted using SNMP, Syslog, or both. However, the management 
stations receiving such events may wish to control the rate of 
transmission of such events. This event throttling behavior is 
provided by the MIB objects in this sub-tree. 
 
Some highlights are as follows: 
 
pktcEventThrottleAdminStatus - this MIB object allows for 
transmissions to be unconstrained, maintained below threshold, 
stopped at the threshold or inhibited. 
 
pktcEventThrottleThreshold - this MIB object specifies the throttle, 
i.e., the number of events over an interval that is considered to be 
the threshold. 
 
pktcEventThrottleInterval - this MIB object specifies the interval 
over which the threshold is calculated.

PacketCable/IPCablecom Event management MTA MIB              June 2008 
 
 
 
4.4    pktcEventStatus  
This sub-tree is designed to provide status information related to 
event transmissions. It currently contains one MIB object, 
pktcEventTransmissionStatus, that allows a client to report the 
status of event transmissions. 
 
 
4.5    pktcEvent 
This sub-tree is designed to provide a list of all the events that 
can be generated by an MTA and its associated descriptions. The MIB 
objects are grouped under the MIB table pktcEventTable. 
 
 
4.6    pktcEventLog 
This sub-tree is designed to allow the MTA to store all the events 
that are generated during its operation. The events are stored with 
information such as the time of the event, its description and 
related characteristics like severity levels. 
 
 
4.7    pktcEventNotifications 
This sub-tree specifies the notification information, when MTAs 
transmit messages using SNMP traps and informs. SNMP traps refer to 
the SNMPv2-Trap-PDU. SNMPv1 traps are disallowed. 
 
5.   Relationship to Other MIB Modules 
Some management objects defined in other MIB modules are applicable 
to an entity implementing this MIB.  In particular, it is assumed 
that an entity implementing the PKTC-IETF-EVENT-MIB module will also 
implement the 'interfaces' group of the IF-MIB [RFC2863]. 
 
5.1    MIB modules required for IMPORTS 
The PKTC-IETF-EVENT-MIB MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI 
[RFC2578], SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMP-FRAMEWORK-MIB [RFC3411], 
SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], IF-MIB [RFC2863], INET-ADDRESS-MIB [RFC4001], 
SNMP-TARGET-MIB [RFC3413], SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB [RFC3413] and the 
SYSLOG-TC-MIB [RFCDDD].

            "This MIB object allows a management station to  
            clear the local log of generated events, reset the  
            management event descriptions, or both. 
 
            MTAs generate management events. These events are stored  
            in the MIB table 'pktcEventLogTable'. If a management  
            station needs to clear all the current entries (e.g.,  
            after a troubleshooting operation is complete), it can  
            do so by setting the resetEventLogTable(0) bit to a  
            value of '1'. 
 
            The MTA is pre-configured with the events that it can  
            generate. This is stored in the MIB table  
            'pktcEventTable'. This table also contains the  
            descriptions associated with these events. These  
            descriptions can be modified by a management station.  
            However, if the management station wishes to reset the  
            descriptions, to factory defaults, it can do so by  
            setting the resetEventTable(1) bit to a value of '1'.

            The MTA actions are summarized below: 
 
              Bit resetEventLogTable(0) set to a value of '1' 
               - delete all entries in pktcEventLogTable;

                 performed individually (in any order). 
 
              Setting a reset bit to a value of '0' MUST NOT 
              result in any action.  
 
            The MTA MUST perform the above actions regardless of  
            persistence (i.e. storage in non-volatile memory). 
 
            The MTA MUST always return a value of '00' when 
            this MIB object is read. 
 
            A management station that resets tables using this MIB  
            Object needs to be careful about the impacts to other  
            management stations that may be reliant on the  
            information contained in the table(s) being reset. For  
            example, say management station A creates a specific set  
            of event descriptions in the event table  
            (pktcEventTable) for debugging purposes and expects any  
            generated events to report the modified descriptions. In              
            such a case, if another management station resets the  
            event table to factory defaults, any subsequent events 
            will not contain the modified descriptions expected by  
            management station A. Such multi-manager contentions are  
            not addressed within this MIB module. Thus, management  
            stations are RECOMMENDED to use this MIB object with  
            care and caution, and only when absolutely required."

10.    IANA Considerations  
     
The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned 
OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:  
     
   Descriptor     OBJECT IDENTIFIER Value  
   ----------     -----------------------  
   pktcIetfEventMib     { mib-2 XXX }  
     
Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is 
requested to assign a value for XXX under the mib-2 subtree and to 
record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry. When the 
assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace XXX 
(here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove 
this note. 
 
11.    Security Considerations  
 
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module 
with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such 
objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
environments. The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
 
 
De Ketelaere/Nechamkin/Channabasappa Expires - December 2008 [Page 34] 

PacketCable/IPCablecom Event management MTA MIB              June 2008 
 
 
network operations. Security threats include events unreported on 
errors, redirection of events (deliberately or otherwise) or 
minimized reporting of errors. Such threats can mask certain 
misconfiguration attempts and denial of service attacks that can be 
recognized and thwarted via event reporting. 
 
MIB objects of significance include: 
- those that control the event generation, the target syslog address  
for events and the reporting status, i.e.: 
    pktcEventReset 
    pktcEventSyslogAddressType 
    pktcEventSyslogAddress 
    pktcEventSyslogPort 
    pktcEventSyslogMessageFormat 
    pktcEventSyslogTransport 
    pktcEventClassStatus 
 
- those related to event classes, i.e.: 
    pktcEventClassSeverity 
 
- those related to throttling, i.e.: 
    pktcEventThrottleAdminStatus 
    pktcEventThrottleThreshold 
    pktcEventThrottleInterval 
 
- those related to the event reporting capabilities of an MTA, i.e: 
    pktcEventSeverityLevel 
    pktcEventReporting 
    pktcEventText 
 
The MIB object pktcEventReset deserves special mention since access 
to this MIB object can be used to disrupt event collection by  
management stations. For example, consider a management station that  
modifies the descriptions in the event table pktcEventTable. It  
would then expect management events generated by the MTA to reflect  
the modified values. A rogue management station that has access to  
the pktcEventReset can reset the event table resulting in the  
management station not receiving events with the expected  
descriptions. Further, a rogue management station with access to  
pktcEventReset can also clear local logs, eliminating local logs of  
generated events for management stations that are not configured to  
receive syslog or SNMP messages. The same concerns apply when  
allowed management stations performing such operations are unaware 
of other management stations that may be reliant on the event table 
or the event log table for management or monitoring. This MIB module 
does not address such multi-manager contentions, and recommends that 
the MIB object pktcEventReset be used with caution. 
 
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects 
 
 
De Ketelaere/Nechamkin/Channabasappa Expires - December 2008 [Page 35] 

PacketCable/IPCablecom Event management MTA MIB              June 2008 
 
 
with a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered 
sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus 
important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects 
and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when 
sending them over the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and 
objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: 
 
pktcEventLogTable: This table contains the log of generated event 
messages. Read access to this table might reveal some specific 
information that should be kept confidential. 
 
pktcEventTransmissionStatus: This MIB object reveals the status of 
event transmission and MAY be sensitive in some environments. 
 
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), 
even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network 
is allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the 
objects in this MIB module. 
 
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features 
as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), 
including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms 
(for authentication and privacy). 
 
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT  
RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to 
an instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give 
access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have 
legitimate rights to perform GET or SET (change/create/delete)  
operations.
