1. Introduction 
    
   The purpose of this draft is to provide a means to stream the 3GPP 
   timed text using RTP. 
    
   The 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) timed text format is 
   specified in Annex D8.a of [1].  It is a time-lined text format 
   defined in the 3GP file format specification, Annex D of [1].  The 
   3GP file format itself follows the ISO (International Standardisation 
   Organisation) base media file format recommendation [2]. 
    
   The 3GP timed text file format was developed by 3GPP as a text format 
   for 3GPP Transparent End-to-end Packet-switched Streaming Services 
   (PSS) [1].  The scope of the 3GPP PSS includes downloading and 
   streaming of multimedia content over 3G packet-switched networks.  
   The PSS adopts multimedia codecs (such as MPEG-4 Visual, AMR, MPEG-4 
   AAC, and JPEG) and protocols like SMIL [3] for presentation layouts 
   or RTP for streaming.  The current usage of the 3GPP timed text file 
   format is limited to downloading (with or without audio contents) due 
   to the lack of an appropriate RTP payload format. 
    
1.1 Features supported by 3GPP Timed Text 
    
   Plain text is a static media without timing information.  It also 
   lacks of information about, for example, colour for each word.  With 
   the 3GPP timed text format, on the other hand, it is possible to 
   specify timing information along with a variety of text attributes, 
   like: font, colour, scrolling, karaoke or hyperlinks, to name but a 
   few.  The timing information allows clients to display one piece of 
   text after another synchronised with audio and video like in 
   subtitles.  The contained text attributes enables the receiver to, 
   for example, render texts in the specified colours and fonts as the

   creator would like.  The hyperlink attribute in the 3GPP timed text 
   allows users to jump to the URL with related content when the text is 
   selected.   
    
1.2 Basics of the 3GP File Format 
    
   Each 3GP file consists of "Boxes".  Boxes start with a header which 
   indicates both size and type contained.  The 3GP file contains the 
   File Type Box (ftyp), the Movie Box (moov), and the Media Data Box 
   (mdat).  The Movie Box and the Media Data Box, serving as containers, 
   include own boxes for each media.  Similarly, each box type may 
   include a number of boxes, see ISO Base Media file Format [2] for a 
   complete list of possibilities. 
    
   In the following, only those boxes are mentioned, which are useful 
   for the purposes of this payload format. 
    
   The File Type Box identifies the type and properties of a 3GP file.  
   The File Type Box contents comprise the major brand, the minor 
   version and the compatible brands.  These are communicated via out-
   of-band means, such as SDP, when streamed with RTP.  For the 3GPP 
   timed text file format, the set of compatible-brands MUST include 
   "3gp5". 
    
   The Movie Box contains one or more Track Boxes (trak) which include 
   information about each track.  A Track Box contains the Track Header 
   Box (tkhd) and the Media Information Box (minf).  The latter includes 
   the Sample Table Box (stbl) which itself contains the Sample 
   Description Box (stsd), the Decoding Time to Sample Box (stts), the 
   Sample Size Box (stsz) and the Sample to Chunk Box (stsc).  
    
   The Track Header Box specifies the characteristics of a single track, 
   where a track is, in this case, the streamed text during a session.  
   Exactly one Track Header Box is needed for a track.  It contains 
   information about the track, such as the spatial layout (width and 
   height), the video transformation matrix and the layer number.  Since 
   these pieces of information are essential and static, i.e. constant 
   for the duration of the session, they MUST be sent prior to the 
   transmission of any text samples.  See the ISO base media file format 
   [2] for details about the definition of the conveyed information. 
    
   When using scene description in SMIL [3], it is possible to specify 
   the layer and the position of the text track.  In this case, the 
   transmission of the Track Header Box (tkhd) is OPTIONAL.  Otherwise, 
   the Track Header Box MUST be sent prior to the start of the text 
   streaming. 
    
   The Sample Table Box (stbl) contains all the time and data indexing 
   of the media samples in a track.  Using the tables here, it is 
   possible to locate samples in time, determine their type, and 
   determine their size, container, and offset into that container.  
   From the Sample Table Box (stbl) the following information is carried 
   in each RTP packet using this payload format: the Sample Description 
     
   Rey, et al.                                                [Page 3] 
   Internet Draft  RTP Payload Format for 3GPP Timed Text    June 2003 
    
    
   Box (stsd), the Decoding Time to Sample Box (stts), the Sample Size 
   Box (stsz) and the Sample to Chunk Box (stsc).  The Decoding Time to 
   Sample Box (stts) is mapped to the field SDUR (Text Sample Duration); 
   the Sample Size Box (stsz) is mapped the field SLEN (Text Sample 
   Length) and the Sample to Chunk Box is mapped to the field SIDX (Text 
   Sample Entry Index).  The Sample to Chunk Box (stsc) associates the 
   text sample and its corresponding sample description entry in the 
   Sample Description Box (stsd, see below).  The Sample to Chunk Box 
   can be used to associate a text sample with a sample description 
   entry.  Since the sample description may vary during the session, the 
   association SDIX must be sent together with the text samples using 
   this payload format. 
    
   The Sample Description Box (stsd) provides information on the basic 
   characteristics of text samples.  An example of such information 
   could be the font size or the background colour.  Since these pieces 
   of information are commonly used by many text samples during the 
   session, it is sent by out-of-bands means.  A complete list of text 
   characteristics can be found in [3].  
    
   Finally, the Media Data Box contains the media data itself.  In 3GPP 
   timed text tracks this box contains text samples.  Its equivalent to 
   audio and video is audio and video frames, respectively.  The text 
   sample consists of the text length, the text string, and one or 
   several Modifier Boxes.  The text length is the size of the text in 
   bytes.  The text string is plain text to render.  The Modifier Box is 
   information to render in addition to the text such as colour, font, 
   etc. 
    
   In general, text samples do not exceed the maximum transfer unit 
   (MTU) of a particular network, but in some cases as explained later 
   on in this document, text samples may become large and might need be 
   fragmented.  This document defines a method to convey both fragmented 
   and non-fragmented text samples in an error resilient way.  
    
    
1.3 Requirements 
    
   In this section a set of requirements is listed.  A justification for 
   each of them is also given.  An RTP Payload Format for 3GPP timed 
   text SHALL: 
    
        1.  Keep the 3GP text sample structure.  The text sample 
   consists of the text length, the text string, and one or several 
   Modifier Boxes, as defined in [1].  This is important to foster 
   interoperability of 3GP and RTP transmission formats. 
        2.  Transmit the text sample size, sample duration and sample 
   description index in-band.  In 3GP format this information is 
   included in the header part.  In RTP it is important to transmit it 
   in-band because this information might change from sample to sample. 
        3.  Transmit the information contained in the Sample Description 
   Box (stsd) out-of-band.  The reason for this being that usually a 
   sample description is referenced often from different text samples.  
     
   Rey, et al.                                                [Page 4] 
   Internet Draft  RTP Payload Format for 3GPP Timed Text    June 2003 
    
    
   To save overhead it is sensible to transmit these pieces of 
   information once at the initialisation phase and update them 
   accordingly upon demand, if needed. 
        4.  Enable the multiplexing of text samples in one single RTP 
   packet.  In a mobile communication environment a typical text sample 
   size is around 100 bytes.  Thus, multiplexing several text samples 
   makes the transport over RTP more efficient. 
        5.  Enable the fragmentation of a text sample into several RTP 
   packets in order to cover a wide range of applications and network 
   environments. 
        6.  Enable the use of resilient transport mechanisms, such as 
   repetition, piggy-backing, retransmissions and FEC, to list a few. 
        7.  Provide a means to minimize the payload header overhead.  In 
   3GP files the text sample size, text sample duration and text sample 
   description index are coded as 32 bit fields.  Typically, in timed 
   text applications the full 32 bits are not used, so the payload 
   format SHALL enable the configuration of the field lengths to reduce 
   overhead. 
    
    
2. Terminology 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [4].

      +                      RTP payload                              | 
      |                                                               |

   Marker bit (M): the marker bit must be set to 1 if the RTP packet 
   includes the last part of a text sample; otherwise set to 0. 
    
   Timestamp: The timestamp indicates the sampling instance of the timed 
   text sample contained in the RTP packet.  The initial value is 
   randomly determined.  If the RTP packet includes more than one text

   sample, the timestamp indicates the sampling instance of the first 
   text sample in the RTP packet. 
    
   The default value of the timestamp clockrate is 1000 Hz.  Other 
   values may be specified by out-of-band means. 
    
   Payload Type (PT): the payload type is set dynamically and sent by 
   out-of-band means. 
    
   The usage of the remaining RTP header fields follows the rules of RTP 
   [5] and the profile in use. 
    
   This payload format defines two payload headers: the text header, 
   THDR,  and the fragment header, FHDR.  The use of these payload 
   headers is defined depending on the contents of the payload.  This 
   payload format is used to convey both fragmented and non-fragmented 
   text samples.  When an RTP packet contains one or more (non-
   fragmented) text samples, only THDR is used for each text sample.  
   When an RTP packet contains one text sample fragment, FHDR is always 
   present and precedes the THDR, if present.  This reduces the overhead.  
   Note that only one text sample fragment is allowed when an RTP packet 
   includes the fragment header, FHDR. 
    
   The RTP sender implementing this payload format sends fragmented and 
   non-fragmented text samples using two different payload types, i.e. 
   payload type multiplexing, which are mapped dynamically.  For this 
   purpose, a new parameter is specified in this document for SDP, 
   "fragment", see Section SDP.  The receiver recognises a fragmented 
   text sample by the payload type value.  Note that this fact does not 
   conflict with Section 5.2 of RTP [5] because it is the same media 
   that is being transmitted. 
    
   The following drawings illustrate the different RTP payload 
   compositions.

3.1 Text Header  
    
   The Text Header, THDR, is used to convey both (whole) text samples 
   and text sample fragments.  It gives basic characteristics of each 
   text sample.  The THDR consists of three fields, SLEN, SIDX and SDUR 
   in this order: 
    
   - SLEN (8, 16, 24 or 32 bits) "Text Sample Length": indicates the 
   size of the text sample in bytes, which corresponds to the entry 
   value in the "stsz" for that sample. 
    
   - SIDX (8, 16, 24 or 32 bits) "Text Sample Entry Index": indicates 
   the reference index for the text sample, which corresponds to the 
   index field in the "stsc" for the sample. 
    
   - SDUR (8, 16, 24 or 32 bits) "Text Sample Duration": indicates the 
   sample duration in timestamp units of the text sample, which 
   corresponds to the entry value in the "stts" for that sample. 
    
   The lengths of these fields are set by out-band means, see Section 
   SDP. 
    
   The composition of the THDR depends on whether the text sample is 
   fragmented or not.  In particular: 
    
   - SLEN MUST NOT be present if the RTP packet contains a text sample 
   fragment.  If the RTP packet carries one or several non-fragmented 
   samples SLEN MUST be present for every text sample.

   - SIDX and SDUR MUST be present always when there is text in the 
   fragment, i.e. T=1.

   In Figure 3.2 (a), the THDR when the "fragment" parameter is set to 0 
   is shown.  All fields are configured as 32 bits size.  While in (b), 
   SLEN is configured as 16 bits and other fields are configured as 8 
   bits (this is configurable by out-of-band means, see Section SDP for 
   details).

4. Error Resilient Transport 
    
   <TODO> 
    
   3GPP Timed Text operates at low bit rates.  For this reason the use 
   of payload redundancy as per RFC 2198 [6] or FEC as per RFC 2733 [7] 
   is RECOMMENDED. 
    
   In addition, the use of retransmission MAY be useful to piggy-back 
   lost packets to the sent packets, according to RFC 2198. 
    
   RFC 2354 [8] discusses a series of options for repairing streaming 
   media.
