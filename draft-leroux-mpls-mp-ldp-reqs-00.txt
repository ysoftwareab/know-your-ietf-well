Abstract 
    
   This document lists a set of functional requirements for Label 
   Distribution Protocol (LDP) extensions for setting up point-to-
   multipoint (P2MP) and potentially multipoint-to-multipoint (MP2MP) 
   Label Switched Paths (LSP), in order to deliver point-to-multipoint 
   applications over a Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) 
   infrastructure. It is intended that solutions that specify LDP 
   procedures for setting up P2MP and MP2MP LSP satisfy these 
   requirements.

2. Introduction 
 
   Many operators have deployed LDP [LDP] for setting up point-to-point 
   (P2P) and multipoint-to-point (MP2P) LSPs, in order to offer point-to 
   -point services in MPLS backbones. 
    
   There are emerging requirements for supporting delivery of point-to-
   multipoint applications in MPLS backbones, such as those defined in 
   [L3VPN-MCAST] and [L2VPN-MCAST].  
    
   An interesting and useful approach for operators who want to support 
   point-to-multipoint traffic delivery on an MPLS backbone and have 
   already deployed LDP for P2P traffic would be to rely on LDP 
   extensions in order to setup point-to-multipoint (P2MP) LSPs and 
   potentially multipoint-to-multipoint (MP2MP) LSPs. This would bring 
   consistency with P2P MPLS applications and would ease the delivery of 
   point-to-multipoint applications in an MPLS backbone. 
    
   This document lists a set of requirements for LDP extensions, for 
   setting up P2MP LSPs and potentially MP2MP LSPs, so as to deliver 
   P2MP traffic over a MPLS infrastructure.  
   It is intended that solutions that specify LDP procedures for P2MP 
   and MP2MP LSP setup, satisfy these requirements. 
    
   Note that generic requirements for point-to-multipoint extensions to 
   MPLS are out of the scope of this document. Rather this document 
   describes solution specific requirements related to LDP extensions in 
   order to set up P2MP and MP2MP LSPs. 
    
   Other mechanisms could be used for setting up P2MP and MP2MP LSPs, 
   such as for instance PIM extensions, but these are out of the scope 
   of this document. The objective is not to compare these mechanisms 
   but rather to focus on the requirements for an LDP extension 
   approach. 
    
   Section 3 points out the problem statement. Section 4 illustrates 
   application scenarios. Finally section 5 addresses detailed 
   requirements.

3. Problem Statement and Requirements Overview 
    
3.1. Problem Statement 
    
   Many operators have deployed LDP [LDP] for setting up P2P and MP2P 
   MPLS LSPs as PE-to-PE tunnels so as to carry point-to-point traffic 
   essentially in Layer 3 and Layer 2 VPN networks. 
   There are emerging requirements for supporting multicast traffic 
   delivery within these VPN infrastructures ([L3VPN-MCAST] and [L2VPN-
   MCAST]).  
   For various reasons, including consistency with P2P applications, and 
   taking full advantages of MPLS network infrastructure, it would be 
   highly desirable to use MPLS LSPs for the delivery of multicast 
   traffic. 
   This could be implemented by setting up a group of P2P or MP2P LSPs, 
   but such an approach may be sub-optimal since it would result in data 
   replication at the ingress LSR, and bandwidth inefficiency (duplicate 
   data traffic within the network). 
   Hence new mechanisms are required that would allow traffic from an 
   Ingress LSR to be efficiently delivered to a number of Egress LSRs in 
   an MPLS backbone, avoiding duplicate copies of a packet on a given 
   link.  
    
   Such efficient traffic delivery requires setting up P2MP LSPs. A P2MP 
   LSPs is an LSP starting at an Ingress LSR, and ending on a set of one 
   or more Egress LSRs. Traffic sent by the Ingress LSR is replicated on 
   one or more Branch LSRs down to Egress LSRs. 
 
   Requirements for setting up P2MP TE LSPs have been expressed in 
   [P2MP-TE-REQ].  RSVP-TE extensions for setting up P2MP Traffic 
   Engineered LSPs have been defined in [P2MP-TE-RSVP]. This approach is 
   useful, in network environments where Traffic Engineering 
   capabilities are required.  
   However, for operators that deployed LDP for setting up PE-to-PE 
   unicast MPLS LSPs, and without the need of traffic engineering, an 
   interesting approach would be using LDP extensions for setting up 
   P2MP LSPs.  
 
   Note that there are other alternatives for setting up P2MP (e.g. PIM 
   extensions defined in [PIM-MPLS]), that could be useful in various 
   situations. These are out of the scope of this document. 
    
   This document focuses on the LDP approach for setting up P2MP LSPs.  
   The following gives a set of guidelines that a specification of LDP 
   extensions for setting up P2MP LSPs should follow.

3.2. Requirements overview 
 
   The multi-point (MP) LDP mechanism MUST support setting up P2MP LSPs, 
   i.e. LSPs with one Ingress LSR and one or more egress LSRs, with 
   traffic replication at some Branch LSRs.  
 
   For traffic delivery between a group of N LSRs which are acting 
   indifferently as Ingress or Egress LSRs, it could be preferable to 
   setup MP2MP LSP connecting all these LSRs, instead of having N P2MP 
   LSPs. This would significantly reduce the amount of states that must 
   be maintained on a given LSR.  
   The traffic sent by any Leaf LSRs of a MP2MP LSP is delivered to all 
   other Leaf LSRs of the MP2MP LSP. 
     
   Hence the MP LDP mechanism SHOULD also allow setting up MP2MP LSPs, 
   connecting a group of leaf LSRs. 
    
   Note that in the following we use the term MP LSP when referring  
   to P2MP and MP2MP LSPs. 
 
   The MP LDP mechanism MUST allow the arbitrary addition or removal of 
   leaves associated with a MP LSP. 
     
   The MP LDP mechanism MUST interoperate seamlessly with existing P2P  
   and MP2P LDP mechanisms.  
   It is of paramount importance that MP LDP mechanisms MUST NOT impede  
   the operation of existing P2P/MP2P LSPs. 
 
   Also the MP LDP mechanism SHOULD scale independently from the number  
   of Leaf LSRs. For example, it SHOULD NOT create an extraordinary    
   number of LFIB entries even as the number of leaves increases.

5. Detailed Requirements 
 
5.1. MP LSPs 
    
5.1.1. P2MP LSP 
    
   The MP LDP mechanism MUST support setting up P2MP LSPs.  
    
   A P2MP LSP has one Ingress LSR and one or more Egress LSRs. Traffic 
   sent by the Ingress LSR is received by all Egress LSRs. The specific 
   aspects related to P2MP LSP is the action required at 
   a Branch LSR, where data replication occurs. Incoming labelled data 
   is appropriately replicated to several outgoing interfaces which may 
   use different labels. Only one copy of a packet MUST be sent on a 
   given link of a P2MP LSP.  
 
   A P2MP LSP MUST be identified by a constant and unique identifier    
   within the whole LDP domain, whatever the number of leaves, which   
   may vary dynamically. 
   This identifier will be used so as to add/remove leaves to/from the 
   P2MP tree.  
 
5.1.2. MP2MP LSP 
    
   The MP LDP mechanism SHOULD allow setting up MP2MP LSPs. 
    
   A MP2MP LSP is a bidirectional LSP whose Leaf LSRs act indifferently 
   as Ingress or Egress. Traffic sent by any Leaf LSRs is received by 
   all other Leaf LSRs. Only one copy of a packet MUST be sent on a 
   given link of a MP2MP LSP. The specific aspect related to a MP2MP LSP 
   is the action required at Hub LSRs, where data replication occurs. A 
   Hub LSR has more than two interfaces on the LSP. A Hub LSR replicates 
   labeled packets received on any interface of the LSP to all other 
   interfaces of the LSP, which may use different labels. 
   A Leaf LSR of a MP2MP LSP MUST NOT receive back a packet it had 
   previously transmitted on the MP2MP LSP. 
    
   A MP2MP LSP MUST be identified by a constant and unique identifier    
   within the whole LDP domain, whatever the number of leaves, which   
   may vary dynamically. 
   This identifier will be used so as to add and remove leaves to and 
   from the MP2MP tree.

Internet Draft   draft-leroux-mpls-mp-ldp-reqs-00.txt        July 2005 


5.1.3. MP LSP FEC 
    
   As with P2P MPLS technology [LDP], traffic MUST be classified into a 
   FEC in this MP extension. All packets which belong to a particular 
   P2MP or MP2MP FEC and which travel from a particular node MUST use 
   the same MP LSP.  
     
   As such, a solution MUST specify a FEC that is suitable for 
   P2MP/MP2MP forwarding. Such P2MP/MP2MP FEC MUST be distinguished 
   clearly from the exiting P2P/MP2P FEC. 
 
5.2. Setting up, tearing down and modifying MP LSPs 
 
   The MP LDP mechanism MUST support the establishment, maintenance and 
   teardown of MP LSPs in a scalable manner. This MUST include both the 
   existence of a large amount of MP LSPs within a single network and a 
   large amount of leaf LSRs for a single MP LSP. 
    
   In order to scale well with a large number of leaves it is 
   RECOMMENDED to follow a leaf-initiated MP LSP setup approach. For 
   that purpose, leaves will have to be aware of the MP LSP identifier. 
   The way a Leaf LSR discovers MP LSPs identifiers SHOULD not be part 
   of MP LDP extensions. Instead this SHOULD be part of the applications 
   that will use MP LSPs, and it is out of the scope of this document. 
    
   The MP LDP mechanism MUST allow the dynamic addition and removal of 
   leaves to and from a MP LSP. It is RECOMMENDED that these operations 
   be leaf-initiated. 
   It is RECOMMENDED that these operations do not cause any additional 
   processing except on the path from the Branch (or possibly Hub) LSR 
   to the added or removed leaf LSR. 
 
5.3. Label Advertisement 
 
   The MP LDP mechanism SHOULD support downstream unsolicited label 
   advertisement mode. This is well suited to a leaf-initiated approach 
   and is consistent with P2P/MP2P LDP operations. 
    
   In order to follow a leaf initiated LSP setup approach, MP LDP 
   mechanism SHOULD support the Ordered label distribution control mode. 
   Note that the Independent control mode is not relevant in a MP 
   context, because the upstream LSRs cannot distribute labels 
   independently like P2P/MP2P LDP, they must wait for label 
   distribution from downstream LSRs. 
 
   Upstream label allocation ([MPLS-UPSTREAM]) may be particularly 
   useful to avoid packet replication on LAN interfaces of a MP LSP, or 
   when encapsulating the MP LSP into a P2MP TE tunnel. 
    
   Hence the MP LDP mechanism SHOULD also support upstream solicited 
   label advertisement mode, where the solicitation is made by the 
   downstream LSR, but the label is assigned by the upstream LSR.

Internet Draft   draft-leroux-mpls-mp-ldp-reqs-00.txt        July 2005 


   Note that the existing base LDP specification [RFC3036] does not 
   specify upstream solicited label advertisement. Hence specific 
   extensions SHOULD be defined.  
    
5.4. Data Duplication 
 
   Data duplication refers to the receipt of multiple copies of a packet 
   by any leaf. Although this may be a marginal situation, it may also 
   be detrimental for certain applications. Hence, data duplication 
   SHOULD be avoided as much as possible, and limited to (hopefully 
   rare) transitory conditions. 
 
   Note, in particular, that data duplication might occur if MP LSP 
   rerouting is being performed (See also section 5.6). 
    
5.5. Avoiding loops 
    
   The MP LDP mechanism SHOULD have a mechanism to avoid routing loops 
   even during transient events. Furthermore, the MP LDP mechanism MUST 
   avoid routing loops that may trigger unexpected non-localized 
   exponential growth of traffic. Note that any loop-avoidance mechanism 
   MUST respect scalability requirements, and particularly SHOULD scale 
   independently from the number of Leaf LSRs.  
 
5.6. MP LSP routing 
    
   As with P2P and MP2P LDP LSPs, the MP LDP mechanism MUST support hop-
   by-hop LSP routing. MP LSP LDP-based routing SHOULD rely upon the 
   information maintained in LSR Routing Information Bases (RIB). For 
   instance, P2MP LSP routing could rely upon a shortest path to the 
   Ingress LSR, and MP2MP LSP routing could rely upon a shortest path to 
   one or more specific Hub LSRs. Note that unlike P2P/MP2P LDP routing, 
   Equal Cost Multi Path (ECMP) MUST be avoided with MP LDP routing. 
 
5.7. MP LSP Re-routing 
 
   The MP LDP mechanism MUST support the rerouting of a MP LSP in the 
   following cases: 
        -A better path exists (e.g. new link, netric change) 
        -Network failure (link or node) 
        -Planned maintenance 
    
5.7.1. Rerouting on a Better Path 
 
   The MP LDP mechanism MUST allow for rerouting of a MP LSP in case a 
   better path is created in the network, for instance as a result of a 
   metric change, or the addition of links or nodes. 
   Traffic disruption MUST be minimized during such rerouting. It is 
   RECOMMENDED that devices perform make-before-break for traffic on MP 
   LSPÆs to minimize traffic disruption. 
   It SHOULD be feasible to avoid packet loss during such rerouting.

Internet Draft   draft-leroux-mpls-mp-ldp-reqs-00.txt        July 2005 


   Unnecessary data duplication during such rerouting MUST also be 
   minimized. 
 
5.7.2. Rerouting due to a Network Failure 
    
   The MP LDP mechanism MUST allow for rerouting of a MP LSP in case of 
   link or node failure(s). The rerouting time SHOULD be minimized as 
   much as possible so as to reduce traffic disruption. 
    
   A mechanism MUST be defined to prevent constant MP LSP teardown and 
   rebuild which may be caused by the instability of a specific 
   link/node in the network.  
 
5.7.3. Rerouting Due to Planned Maintenance 
 
   The MP LDP mechanism MUST support planned maintenance operations. It 
   SHOULD be possible to reroute a MP-LSP before a link/node is 
   deactivated for maintenance purposes. Traffic disruption MUST be 
   minimized during such rerouting. It SHOULD be feasible to avoid 
   packet loss during such rerouting.  
   Unnecessary traffic duplication during such rerouting MUST also be 
   minimized. 
 
5.8. Support for LAN interfaces 
 
   The MP LDP mechanism MUST provide a way for a Hub/Branch LSR to send 
   a single copy of the data onto an Ethernet LAN interface and reach 
   multiple adjacent downstream nodes. This requires that the same label 
   be negotiated will all downstream LSRs for the LSP. In order to ease 
   such negotiation an upstream label allocation approach may be used. 
 
5.9. Support for encapsulation in P2P and P2MP TE tunnels 
 
   The MP LDP mechanism MUST support nesting MP LSPs into P2P and P2MP 
   TE tunnels.  
   The MP LDP mechanism MUST provide a way for a Hub/Branch LSR of a MP 
   LPS, which is also a Head End LSR of a P2MP TE tunnel, to send a 
   single copy of the data onto the tunnel and reach all downstream LSRs 
   on the MP LSP, which are also Egress LSRs of the tunnel. As with LAN 
   interfaces, this requires that the same LDP label be negotiated with 
   all downstream LSRs for the MP LDP LSP. In order to ease such 
   negotiation, an upstream label allocation approach may be used. 
 
5.10. Label spaces 
 
   Labels for MP LSPs and P2P/MP2P LSPs MAY be assigned from shared or 
   dedicated label spaces.  
   MPLS Context Specific Label Spaces ([UPSTREAM-LABEL]) and 
   particularly Upstream label spaces and Tunnel label spaces MAY be 
   required to support upstream label allocation so as to avoid packet 
   replication on LAN or P2MP TE Tunnel interfaces.

   Note that dedicated label spaces will require the establishment of 
   separate MP LDP sessions. 
    
5.11. IPv4/IPv6 support 
    
   The MP LDP mechanism MUST be equally applicable to IPv4 and IPv6 
   traffic. Likewise, it SHOULD be possible to convey both kinds of 
   traffic in a given MP LSP facility. 
    
   Also the MP LDP mechanism MUST support the establishment of LDP 
   sessions over both IPv4 and IPv6 control planes. 
    
5.12. Multi-Area LSPs 
    
   The MP LDP mechanism MUST support the establishment of multi-area MP 
   LSPs, i.e. LSPs whose leaves do not all reside in the same IGP area. 
   This SHOULD be possible without requiring the advertisement of Leaf 
   LSRs' addresses across IGP areas. 
    
5.13. OAM 
 
   LDP management tools ([LDP-MIB],...) MUST be enhanced to support MP 
   LDP extensions. This may yield a new MIB module, which may possibly 
   be inherited from the LDP MIB. 
    
   In order to facilitate correct management, MP LDP LSPs MUST have 
   unique identifiers, otherwise it is impossible to determine which LSP 
   is being managed. 
   OAM facilities will have special demands in MP MPLS environments 
   especially within the context of tracing the paths and determining 
   the connectivity of MP LSPs. Further and precise requirements and 
   mechanisms for OAM purpose are out of the scope of this document. It 
   is expected that a separate document will cover these requirements 
   and mechanisms. 
    
5.14. Graceful Restart and Fault Recovery 
 
   LDP Graceful Restart mechanisms [LDP-GR] and Fault Recovery [LDP-FT] 
   mechanisms SHOULD be enhanced to support MP LDP LSPs. 
    
   Particularly [LDP-GR] applies only to downstream unsolicited label 
   distribution. Hence new mechanisms are required to account for 
   upstream label assignment, particularly in multi segment LANs. 
    
5.15. Robustness 
 
   A solution SHOULD avoid whatever single points of failures or propose 
   some technical solutions for a failover mechanism (e.g., redundancy/ 
   failover of Hub LSRs).

5.16. Scalability 
    
   Scalability is a key requirement for the MP LDP mechanism.  
   It MUST be designed to scale well with an increase in the number of 
   any of the following: 
      - number of Leaf LSRs per MP LSP 
      - number of Branch/Hub LSRs per MP LSP 
      - number of MP LSPs per LSR 
 
   The size of a MP LSP state on a LSR SHOULD be independent of the 
   number of leaves, and SHOULD only depend on the number of adjacent 
   LSRs. 
    
5.16.1. Orders of magnitude of the expected numbers of MP LSPs and 
       leaves per LSP in operational networks 
    
   To be completed in next revision 
    
5.17. Backward Compatibility 
    
   In order to allow for a smooth migration, the MP LDP mechanism SHOULD 
   offer as much backward compatibility as possible. In particular, the 
   solution SHOULD allow the setup of a MP LSP along non branch/hub 
   transit LSRs that do not support MP LDP extensions. 
 
   Also, the MP LDP solution MUST interoperate seamlessly with current 
   LDP mechanisms and inherit its capability sets from [LDP]. The MP LDP 
   solution MUST not impede the operation of P2P/MP2P LSPs. A MP LSP 
   solution MUST be designed in such a way that it allows P2P/MP2P and 
   MP LSPs to be signalled on the same interface. 
 
6. Evaluation criteria 
 
6.1. Performances 
 
      The solution will be evaluated with respect to the following 
      criteria: 
    
      (1) Time (in msec) to add or remove a Leaf LSR 
      (2) Time (in msec) to repair a MP LSP in case of link or node  
          failure 
      (3) Scalability (state size, number of messages, message size). 
    
   Particularly, the MP LDP mechanism SHOULD be designed so that 
   convergence times in case of link or node failure are minimized, in 
   order to limit traffic disruption.  
 
6.2. Complexity and Risks 
    
   The proposed solution SHOULD not introduce complexity to the current 
   LDP operations to such a degree that it would affect the stability 
   and diminish the benefits of deploying such MP LDP solution.

7. Security Considerations 
    
   This document does not introduce any new security issues beyond those 
   inherent to LDP [LDP] and a MP LDP solution may use the same 
   mechanisms.
