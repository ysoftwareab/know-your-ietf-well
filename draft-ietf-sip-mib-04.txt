1. Introduction 
    
   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) 
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. 
   In particular, it describes a set of managed objects that are used 
   to manage Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) entities, which include 
   User Agents, Proxy servers, Redirect servers and Registrars. 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [16].  
    
    
2. The SNMP Management Framework 
    
   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major 
   components: 
    
   o  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1]. 
 
   o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the 
      purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of 
      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in 
      STD16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The 
      second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 
      [5], RFC 2579 [6] and RFC 2580 [7]. 
 
   o  Message protocols for transferring management information.  The 
      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and

   Internet-Draft              SIP MIB                  February 2002 
    
      described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message 
      protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is 
      called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10]. 
      The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and 
      described in RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574 [12]. 
 
   o  Protocol operations for accessing management information. The 
      first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is 
      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol 
      operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 
      [13]. 
 
   o  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and 
      the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 
      [15]. 
      
   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management 
   Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [20]. 
    
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are 
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.  
    
   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A 
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate 
   translations. The resulting translated MIB MUST be semantically 
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no 
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine-readable 
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in 
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine-
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of 
   the MIB. 
    
    
3. Overview 
    
   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [17] is an application-layer 
   control protocol that can establish, modify and terminate multimedia 
   sessions or calls. This MIB provides some managed objects for SIP 
   entities defined in RFC 2543 - User Agent, Proxy server, Redirect 
   server and Registrar. It is provided as a base for the work within 
   the working group to define a MIB. 
    
   This MIB is intended to provide management of the basic SIP 
   entities. It provides for monitoring of status and protocol 
   statistics, as well as for configuration of SIP entities. It also 
   includes objects for the SIP INFO method [19]. 
    
    
4. Structure of SIP MIB 
 
   This memo specifies four MIB modules.  They are SIP-COMMON-MIB, SIP-
   SERVER-MIB, SIP-UA-MIB and SIP-TC.  SIP-COMMON-MIB contains common 
     
   Lingle/Maeng/Mule/Walker                                   [Page 3] 

   Internet-Draft              SIP MIB                  February 2002 
    
   objects used in all the SIP entities. SIP-SERVER-MIB contains 
   objects specific to Registrars, Proxies and Redirect servers, and 
   SIP-UA-MIB includes objects specific to User Agents.  SIP-TC defines 
   the textual conventions used throughout MIB modules.  
    
   The MIB Modules contain following groups of objects: 
 
   -- SIP-COMMON-MIB: Common to all the SIP entities 
      sipCommonConfigGroup,  
      sipCommonStatsGroup,  
      sipCommonConfigTimerGroup, 
      sipCommonConfigTimerExtMethodGroup, 
      sipCommonConfigRetryGroup, 
      sipCommonConfigRetryExtMethodGroup, 
      sipCommonStatsRetryGroup, 
      sipCommonStatsRetryExtMethodsGroup, 
      sipCommonNotifGroup, 
      sipCommonStatusCodeNotifGroup. 
    
   -- SIP-SERVER-MIB: Groups of objects for Registrars, Proxy and 
   -- Redirect Servers 
      sipServerConfigGroup, 
      sipProxyConfigGroup, 
      sipProxyStatsGroup, 
      sipRegistrarConfigGroup, 
      sipRegistrarStatsGroup. 
 
   -- SIP-UA-MIB: Groups of objects for User Agents 
      sipUAConfigGroup 
        
   To conform with this specification, an SNMP agent MUST implement 
   SIP-TC, plus one instance of SIP-COMMON-MIB and one instance of the 
   SIP entity-type-specific MIB (SIP-SERVER-MIB or SIP-UA-MIB) as 
   applicable for each instance of a SIP entity being managed.  If a 
   device has more than one sip entity or multiple instances of the 
   same entity, it SHOULD implement multiple SIP modules. Section 4.2 
   describes handling of multiple instances in detail. 
    
4.1. Textual Conventions 
    
   The data type SipTransportProtocol is used as textual conventions in 
   this document.  These textual conventions have NO effect on either 
   the syntax or the semantics of any managed object.  Objects defined 
   using these conventions are always encoded by means of the rules 
   that define their primitive type.  Hence, no changes to the SMI or 
   the SNMP are necessary to accommodate these textual conventions, 
   which are adopted merely for the convenience of readers.

4.2. Relationship to Other MIBs 
    
   There is a requirement to be able to support multiple instances of 
   various SIP MIB modules in the context of a single system having a 
   single SNMP agent.        
        
   This requirement is solved by using the framework provided by the 
   NETWORK-SERVICES-MIB, RFC 2788 [18]. A device implementing the SIP 
   MIB MUST support the NETWORK-SERVICES-MIB and, at a minimum, it MUST 
   support the applIndex and applName objects in applTable.  The 
   following applName conventions will be adopted: 
    
       o for a SIP Proxy entity, applName MUST be equal to "sip_proxy" 
       o for a SIP Redirect entity, applName MUST be equal to 
         "sip_redirect" 
       o for a SIP Registrar entity, applName MUST be equal to 
         "sip_registrar" 
       o for a SIP User Agent entity, applName MUST be equal to 
         "sip_ua" 
       o for any combination of Proxy, Registrar, or Redirect Server 
         being managed as a single aggregate entity, the applName for  
         the combined server entity MUST reflect the appropriate 
         combination. For example, "sip_proxy_redirect" or  
         "sip_proxy_registrar". 
    
   The SNMP agent MAY support any combination of the other attributes 
   in applTable.  If the following objects are supported, the object 
   values SHOULD be populated as follows: 
    
       o applVersion: version of the SIP application;  if the SIP 
         protocol version is used, the value MUST be as defined in SIP 
         [17], section 4.3.1. 
       o applUptime: value MUST be identical to sipServiceStartTime 
         defined in the SIP-COMMON-MIB module, 
       o applOperStatus: value SHOULD reflect the operational status 
         defined in sipServiceOperStatus, at least by means of a 
         mapping, 
       o applLastChange: value MUST be identical to 
         sipServiceLastChange defined in the SIP-COMMON module. 
    
   Note: There are a number of other objects in the applTable.  They 
   are not included for the sake of brevity and for the fact that they 
   do not enhance the concept being presented. 
    
    
   Example 1:  
    
   The tables below illustrate how a system acting as both Proxy and 
   Registrar server might be configured to maintain separate SIP-
   COMMON-MIB instances. 
   The NETWORK-SERVICES-MIB applTable might be populated as follows:

   The SIP-COMMON-MIB sipCommonCfgTable would have two rows: one for 
   the proxy (applIndex=1) and one for the registrar (applIndex=2).  
   The SIP-SERVER-MIB tables would, however, only be populated with one 
   row  indexed by applIndex=1 and applIndex=2 respectively if the 
   server provides either proxy or registrar.

   Internet-Draft              SIP MIB                  February 2002 
    
     
                 may be common to all SIP entities.    
                     
                 SIP is an application-layer signalling protocol for     
                 creating, modifying and terminating multimedia     
                 sessions with one or more participants. These sessions    
                 include Internet multimedia conferences and Internet     
                 telephone calls.  SIP is defined in RFC 2543 (March     
                 1999).    
       
                 This MIB is defined for managing objects which are    
                 common to SIP User Agents (UAs), Proxy and Redirect     
                 Servers, and Registrars.  Objects specific to each of    
                 these entities may be managed using entity specific    
                 MIBs defined in other modules.    
       
                 A User Agent is an application that contains both a    
                 User Agent Client (UAC) and a User Agent Server (UAS).    
                 A UAC is an application that initiates a SIP request.    
                 A UAS is an application that contacts the user when a    
                 SIP request is received and that returns a response on    
                 behalf of the user.  The response accepts, rejects, or    
                 redirects the request.    
       
                 A Proxy Server acts as both a client and a server.    
                 It accepts requests from other clients, either    
                 responding to them or passing them on to other    
                 servers, possibly after modification.    
       
                 A Redirect Server accepts requests from clients and    
                 returns zero or more addresses to that client. Unlike    
                 a Proxy server it does not initiate requests.  Unlike    
                 a User Agent Server it does not accept calls.    
       
                 A Registrar is a server that accepts REGISTER    
                 requests.  A Registrar is typically co-located with a    
                 Proxy or Redirect Server."

             As and example of a non-standard feature, a user agent

             'com.example.billing' feature, which it would    
             indicate in a Require header.  Such a client would have    
             a row in its sipFtrSupportedTable containing the string    
             'com.example.billing'.  Similarly, a server which is    
             capable of handling requests for such features would list    
             the string in its sipFtrSupportedTable.

             (indicated in a Require header to a UAS, or in a Proxy-    
             Require to a proxy server), the server returns a 420 Bad

             For IETF standardized features, the complete path

             Normally the list of such features supported by an entity

        DESCRIPTION    
                "Initial version of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)    
                 User Agent (UA) MIB module.    
                     
                 SIP is an application-layer signalling protocol for     
                 creating, modifying and terminating multimedia     
                 sessions with one or more participants. These sessions    
                 include Internet multimedia conferences and Internet     
                 telephone calls.  SIP is defined in RFC 2543 (March     
                 1999).    
                     
                 A User Agent is an application that contains both a    
                 User Agent Client (UAC) and a User Agent Server (UAS).    
                 A UAC is an application that initiates a SIP request.    
                 A UAS is an application that contacts the user when a    
                 SIP request is received and that returns a response on    
                 behalf of the user.  The response accepts, rejects, or    
                 redirects the request."

        DESCRIPTION    
                "Initial version of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)    
                 Server MIB module.    
       
                 SIP is an application-layer signalling protocol for     
                 creating, modifying and terminating multimedia     
                 sessions with one or more participants. These sessions    
                 include Internet multimedia conferences and Internet     
                 telephone calls.  SIP is defined in RFC 2543 (March     
                 1999).    
       
                 This MIB is defined for the management of SIP Proxy,     
                 Redirect, and Registrar Servers.    
       
                 A Proxy Server acts as both a client and a server.    
                 It accepts requests from other clients, either    
                 responding to them or passing them on to other    
                 servers, possibly after modification.    
       
                 A Redirect Server accepts requests from clients and    
                 returns zero or more addresses to that client. 
                 Unlike a User Agent Server it does not accept calls.   
   
                 A Registrar is a server that accepts REGISTER    
                 requests.  A Registrar is typically co-located with a    
                 Proxy or Redirect Server."

6. Changes from previous drafts 
    
   o  Changes from draft-ietf-sip-mib-03 
    
   These are the specific draft-ietf-sip-mib-04 changes to the MIB 
   modules based on what they looked like for draft-ietf-sip-mib-03. 
    
    
   Front paper/Back paper 
       o Rewrote parts of section 4.2 
       o Fixed minor editorial nits 
    
   SIP-COMMON-MIB 
    
   o CONTACT-INFO "SIP MIB email" changed to sip@ietf.org 
    
   o sipInviteTimeout was removed from the MIB.  See below regarding new 
   sipCommonCfgExpires objects.  They provide equivalent functionality 
   with extensibility beyond INVITE. 
    
   o sipCommonCfgExpires OID subtree added.  Per method Expires 
   configuration objects were added there. 
   This new high-level OID was placed under the existing  
   sipCommonCfgRetry OID and therefore, caused the OIDs for the 
   subsequent groups to change (incrementing by one). 
    
   o Objects from tables under sipCommonCfgExpires were added to a new 
   OBJECT-GROUP sipCommonConfigExpiresGroup, and that group was listed 
   as optional in sipCommonCompliance. 
    
   o Minor DESCRIPTION change for sipCommonCfgEntry.  No behavior 
   change. 
    
   o sipServiceOperStatus SYNTAX changed. 
     New values added: congested & quiescing 
     Old values removed: halted 
     The order of the enumeration was altered as well.

   Internet-Draft              SIP MIB                  February 2002 
    
    
   o sipServiceAdminStatus SYNTAX changed. 
     New values added: noop, up, down, quieseSessions, and 
                       quieseApplications 
     Old values removed: shutdown, restart, stop, rts. 
     These changes were made based on comments from last call reviewer 
   and general known ambiguities in the previous design of the object. 
    
   o Clarifying changes to the DESCRIPTION of sipServiceStartTime. 
    
   o Clarifying changes to the DESCRIPTION of sipOrganization. 
    
   o Clarification of behavior for sipPortStatus while row is 
     'active'. 
    
   o Clarifying changes to the DESCRIPTION of sipUriSupportedTable 
    
   o Clarifying changes to the DESCRIPTIONs of sipFtrSupportedTable, 
     sipFtrSupportedEntry, and sipFtrSupported. 
     Specifically, IETF standard features and non-standard features are 
   now represented by this table.  Only non-standard features were 
   mentioned in prior revisions of the draft. 
    
   o Reference to usage of RFC 2788 applIndex moved from  
     sipCommonCfgTimerExtMethodTable to sipCommonCfgTimerExtMethodEntry. 
     This was the convention for other table/entry definitions in 
     the MIB, so these objects were previously unconventional. 
    
   o DEFVAL removed from sipCfgTimerExtMethodTimer.  The generic nature 
     of the "extension" object does not lend itself to being able to 
     specify a particular default value. 
    
   o Since the removal of the DEFVAL clause from  
   sipCfgTimerExtMethodTimer,  
     a value for that object must be specified when creating a  
     sipCommonCfgTimerExtMethodEntry.  The description of  
     sipCfgTimerExtMethodStatus was updated to reflect this. 
    
   o sipCommonCfgRetryExtMethodTable is now properly defined under 
     sipCommonCfgRetry OID space instead of under sipCommonCfgTimer 
     OID space. 
    
   o DEFVAL removed from sipCfgRetryExtMethodRetry.  The generic nature 
     of the "extension" object does not lend itself to being able to 
     specify a particular default value. 
    
   o Since the removal of the DEFVAL clause from  
   sipCfgRetryExtMethodRetry,  
     a value for that object must be specified when creating a  
     sipCommonCfgRetryExtMethodEntry.  The description of  
     sipCfgRetryExtMethodStatus was updated to reflect this. 
    
   o Clarifying changes to the DESCRIPTION of 
   sipSummaryTotalTransactions.

   Internet-Draft              SIP MIB                  February 2002 
    
     Specifically, the object is not applicable to stateless SIP proxy  
     servers and the object should always return a value of 0 if  
     implemented by a stateless proxy. 
    
   o Clarifying changes to the DESCRIPTION of sipStatsExtMethodStatus. 
      
   o sipStatsOtherClassesIns and sipStatsOtherClassesOuts counter 
     objects were added to sipStatusCodesTable to handle possible 
     future classes of response status codes. 
    
   o Text referring specifically to Redirect Server in  
     sipStatsRedirClassIns and sipStatsRedirClassOuts was removed. 
    
   o Text defining protocol behavior in sipStatsServerFailClassIns, 
     sipStatsServerFailClassOuts, sipStatsGlobalFailClassIns, and 
     sipStatsGlobalFailClassOuts was removed. 
    
   o sipCommonStatusCodeNotifInterval SYNTAX changed from TimeTicks 
     to Unsigned32 w/ a UNITS of "seconds" added to the definition. 
     DEFVAL clause changed accordingly. 
    
   o sipStatusCodeNotifTo, sipStatusCodeNotifFrom,  
   sipStatusCodeNotifCallId, 
     and sipStatusCodeNotifCSeq all had clarifying changes to their 
     DESCRIPTIONs.  Specifically, the header name will be part of the 
     object value and example values were given. 
    
   o Clarifying changes to the DESCRIPTION of sipCurrentTransTable 
     and sipTransactionTable.  Specifically, these tables are not  
     applicable to transaction stateless SIP proxy servers. 
    
   o Minor gramatical change to the DESCRIPTION of sipCurrentTransEntry. 
    
   o sipTransMethod and sipTransActivityInfo objects were added to  
     sipTransactionTable while sipTransCallingPartyContentType and  
     sipTransCalledPartyContentType were removed. 
    
   o Clarifying changes to the DESCRIPTION of sipTransState. 
     Specifically, noting that not all values of the object 
     are applicable to all transaction types. 
    
   o sipTransTo, sipTransFrom, sipTransCallId, and sipTransCSeq  
     all had clarifying changes to their DESCRIPTIONs.   
     Specifically, the header name will be part of the object 
     value and example values were given. 
    
   o Minor gramatical change to the DESCRIPTION of sipOtherStatsEntry. 
    
   o sipCommonStatusCodeIns and sipCommonStatusCodeOuts objects were 
     added to the varbind of sipStatusCodeNotif. 
    
   o Appropriate changes were made to sipCommonStatsGroup OBJECT-GROUP 
     based on objects being added and/or removed from the MIB.

   In general 
       o Eliminated the SIP-MIB-SMI modules.  Each MIB module will now  
         get it's own IANA OID. 
       o Top-level OID subtrees restructured in each MIB. 
       o General cleanup/removal of "placeholder" OID subtrees

         only object in the table.  OID is now "1". 
       o High-level OID structure of the MIB is now sequential. 
       o Incorrect object descriptor for sipCfgInitialTimerRsp 
         inconsistent with reference in compliance section. 
       o Inconsistencies between sipCommonStatsRetryGroup definition 
         and SipCommonStatsRetryEntry OBJECT-TYPE corrected. 
       o sipNotifApplIndex was not in any object group in the  
         conformance section. 
    
   Regarding SIP-SERVER-MIB 
       o Removed sipInformationTryingInterval. 
       o Removed sipRxProxyAuthTable. 
       o Removed sipRegRespHasContacts.

       o Removed sipRegContactDfltExpiryDuration. 
       o Removed sipUserPassword. 
       o sipRequestMaxExpires DESCRIPTION changed to no  
         longer specifically mention 400 response. 
       o sipProxyStateful object descriptor changed to 
         sipProxyStatefullness and the SYNTAX changed 
         from TruthValue to an enumerated INTEGER. 
       o sipProxyStateTimeout DESCRIPTION changed to now reflect only 
         INVITE. 
       o Gauge32 was not being IMPORTed. 
       o sipServerContactDfltAction showed up in conformance 
         and other object descriptions in an older form. 
       o sipServerHost replaced with InetAddressType/InetAddress 
         object pair (sipServerHostAddrType & sipServerHostAddr). 
    
   Regarding SIP-UA-MIB 
       o IMPORTed Unsigned32 to support sipUACfgSipServerAddrIndex. 
       o sipUACfgSipServerEntry was referencing the wrong 
         auxilliary object and listing that object in the conformance 
         section. 
       o sipUACfgSipServerEntry listed sipUACfgSipServerStatus 
         when it should have been listing sipUACfgSipServerAddrStatus. 
       o SIP-UA-MIB IMPORTed Counter32, but never used it. 
         Removed the IMPORT of Counter32.

7. Security Considerations 
    
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that 
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such 
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
   environments. The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
   network operations. 
    
   The managed objects in this MIB contain sensitive information since, 
   collectively, they allow tracing and influencing of connections in 
   SIP entities and provide information of their connection 
   characteristics. 
    
   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and 
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending 
   them over the network via SNMP. Not all versions of SNMP provide 
   features for such a secure environment. 
    
   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the network 
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), there is no control 
   as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET/SET 
   (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB. 
    
   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security 
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically, the use 
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View-based 
   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended. 
    
   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP 
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly 
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals 
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET 
   (change/create/delete) them. 
 
8. Intellectual Property 
    
   The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any 
   intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to 
   pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in 
   this document or the extent to which any license under such rights 
   might or might not be available; neither does it represent that it 
   has made any effort to identify any such rights.  Information on the 
   IETF's procedures with respect to rights in standards-track and 
   standards-related documentation can be found in BCP-11.  Copies of 
   claims of rights made available for publication and any assurances 
   of licenses to be made available, or the result of an attempt made 
   to obtain a general license or permission for the use of such 
   proprietary rights by implementors or users of this specification 
   can be obtained from the IETF Secretariat. 
    
   The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any 
   copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary 
   rights which may cover technology that may be required to practice
