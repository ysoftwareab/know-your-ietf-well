                 Time-Based Uni-Directional Attestation
                      draft-birkholz-rats-tuda-05

Abstract

   This document defines the method and bindings used to convey Evidence
   via Time-based Uni-Directional Attestation (TUDA) in Remote
   ATtestation procedureS (RATS).  TUDA does not require a challenge-
   response handshake and thereby does not rely on the conveyance of a
   nonce to prove freshness of remote attestation Evidence.  TUDA
   enables the creation of Secure Audit Logs that can constitute
   believable Evidence about both current and past operational states of
   an Attester.  In TUDA, RATS entities require access to a Handle
   Distributor to which a trustable and synchronized time-source is
   available.  The Handle Distributor takes on the role of a Time Stamp
   Authority (TSA) to distribute Handles incorporating Time Stamp Tokens
   (TST) to the RATS entities.  RATS require an Attesting Environment
   that generates believable Evidence.  While a TPM is used as the
   corresponding root of trust in this specification, any other type of
   root of trust can be used with TUDA.

1.  Introduction

   Remote ATtestation procedureS (RATS) describe the attempt to
   determine and appraise system properties, such as integrity and
   trustworthiness, of a remote peer -- the Attester -- by the use of a
   Verifier in support of Relying Parties that intend to interact with
   the Attester.  The Verifier carries the burden of appraisal of
   detailed Evidence about an Attester's trustworthiness.  Evidence is
   generated by the Attester and consumed by the Verifier.  To support
   security decisions, the Verifier generates digestable Attestation
   Results that can be easily consumed by Relying Parties.  The RATS
   architecture specifies the corresponding concepts and terms
   [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture].

Internet-Draft                    TUDA                         July 2021


   TUDA uses the architectural constituents of the RATS Architecture,
   such as the roles Attester and Verifier, and defines a method to
   convey Conceptual Messages between them.  TUDA uses the Uni-
   Directional Remote Attestation interaction model described in
   [I-D.ietf-rats-reference-interaction-models].  While the Conceptual
   Message focused on in this document is RATS Evidence, any type of
   Conceptual Message content that requires a believable indication
   about the message's content freshness can be conveyed with TUDA (e.g.
   Attestation Results).

   The conveyance of Evidence in RATS must ensure that Evidence always
   remains integrity protected, tamper-evident, originates from a
   trustable entity (or group of entities), and is accompanied by a
   proof of its freshness.

   In contrast to bi-directional interactions as described by Challenge/
   Response Remote Attestation in
   [I-D.ietf-rats-reference-interaction-models], TUDA enables uni-
   directional conveyance in the interactions between Attester and
   Verifier.  TUDA allows a Verifier to receive Evidence from an
   Attester without solicitation.  Conversely, it allows a Verifier to
   retrieve Evidence from an Attester without it being generated ad-hoc.
   Exemplary applications of TUDA are the creation of beacons in
   vehicular environments [IEEE1609] or authentication mechanisms based
   on EAP [RFC5247].

   The generation of Evidence in RATS requires an Attesting Environment.
   In this specification, the root of trust acting as an Attesting
   Environment is a Trusted Platform Module (TPM, see [TPM12] and
   [TPM2]).  The Protected Capabilities [TCGGLOSS] provided by a TPM
   support various activities in RATS, e.g., Claims collection and
   Evidence generation.

   A trusted coupling of Evidence generation with a global timescale is
   enabled via a Handle Distributor.  Handles generated by a Handle
   Distributor can include nonces, signed timestamps, or other
   structured or opaque content used as qualifying data in Evidence
   generation.  In TUDA, all RATS entities, such as the entities taking
   on the roles of Attester and Verifier, can receive signed timestamps
   from the Handle Distributor.  These trusted timestamps replace nonces
   in Evidence generation and Evidence appraisal
   [I-D.ietf-rats-reference-interaction-models].

1.1.  Forward Authenticity

   Nonces enable an implicit time-keeping in which the freshness of
   Evidence is inferred by recentness.  Recentness is estimated via the
   time interval between sending a nonce as part of a challenge for
   Evidence and the reception of Evidence based on that nonce (as
   outlined in the interaction model depicted in section 8.1 in
   [I-D.ietf-rats-reference-interaction-models]).  Conversely, the
   omission of nonces in TUDA allows for explicit time-keeping where
   freshness is not inferred from recentness.  Instead, a cryptographic
   binding of a trusted synchronization to a global timescale in the
   Evidence itself allows for Evidence that can prove past operational
   states of an Attester.  To capture and support this concept, this
   document introduces the term Forward Authenticity.

   Forward Authenticity:  A property of secure communication protocols,
      in which later compromise of the long-term keys of a data origin
      does not compromise past authentication of data from that origin.
      Forward Authenticity is achieved by timely recording of
      authenticity Claims from Target Environments (via "audit logs"
      during "audit sessions") that are authorized for this purpose and
      trustworthy (via endorsed roots of trusts, for example), in a
      time-frame much shorter than that expected for the compromise of
      the long-term keys.

      Forward Authenticity enables new levels of assurance and can be
      included in basically every protocol, such as ssh, YANG Push,
      router advertisements, link layer neighbor discovery, or even ICMP
      echo requests.

1.2.  TUDA Objectives

   Time-Based Uni-directional Attestation is designed to:

   *  increase the confidence in authentication and authorization
      procedures,

   *  address the requirements of constrained-node networks,

   *  support interaction models that do not maintain connection-state
      over time, such as REST architectures [REST],

   *  be able to leverage existing management interfaces, such as SNMP
      (RFC 3411, [STD62]).  RESTCONF [RFC8040] or CoMI
      [I-D.ietf-core-comi] --- and corresponding bindings,

   *  support broadcast and multicast schemes (e.g.  [IEEE1609]),

   *  be able to cope with temporary loss of connectivity, and to

   *  provide trustworthy audit logs of past endpoint states.

1.3.  Terminology

   This document uses the terms defined in the RATS Architecture
   [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture] and by the RATS Reference Interaction
   Models [I-D.ietf-rats-reference-interaction-models].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Remote Attestation Principles

   Based on the RATS Architecture, the processing of TPM generated
   Evidence can be separated in three activities.

   Evidence Generation:  The retrieval of signed digests from an RTR
      based on a sequence of collected Claims about software component
      integrity (measurements).

   Evidence Conveyance:  The transfer of Evidence from the Attester to
      the Verifier via the Internet.

   Evidence Appraisal:  The validation of Evidence signatures as well as
      the assessment of Claim values in Evidence by comparing them with
      Reference Values.

   TUDA is specified in support of these RATS activities that align with
   the definitions presented in [PRIRA] and [TCGGLOSS].

Internet-Draft                    TUDA                         July 2021


2.1.  Authenticity of Evidence

   Remote attestation Evidence is composed of a set of Claims
   (assertions about the trustworthiness of an Attester's Target
   Environments) that is accompanied by a proof of its veracity --
   typically a signature based on shielded, private, and potentially
   use-restricted key material used as an Authentication Secret as
   specified in section 6 of
   [I-D.ietf-rats-reference-interaction-models] (or a secure channel as
   illustrated in [I-D.birkholz-rats-uccs]).  As key material alone is
   typically not self-descriptive with respect to its intended use (its
   semantics), the Evidence created via TUDA MUST be accompanied by two
   kinds of certificates that are cryptographically associated with a
   trust anchor (TA) [RFC4949] via certification paths:

   *  an Attestation Key (AK) Certificate (AK-Cert) that represents the
      attestation provenance of the Attesting Environment (see section
      4.2. in [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture]) that generates Evidence, and

   *  an Endorsement Key (EK) Certificate (EK-Cert) that represents the
      Protection Capabilities of an Attesting Environment the AK is
      stored in.

   If a Verifier decides to trust the TA of both an AK-Cert and an EK-
   Cert presented by an Attester -- and thereby the included Claims
   about the trustworthiness of an Attester's Target Environments -- the
   Evidence generated by the Attester can be considered trustable and
   believable.  Ultimately, all trustable and believable Evidence MUST
   be appraised by a Verifier in order to assess the trustworthiness of
   the corresponding Attester.  Assertions represented via Claims MUST
   NOT be considered believable by themselves.

   In this document, Evidence is generated via TPMs that come with an
   AK-Cert and a EK-Cert as a basis for believable Evidence generation.

2.2.  Generating Evidence about Software Component Integrity

   Evidence generated by a TPM for TUDA is based on measured hash values
   of all software components deployed in Target Environments (see
   section 4.2. in [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture]) before they are
   executed ("measure then execute").  The underlying concept of
   "Attestation Logs" is elaborated on in Section 2.4.2. of
   [I-D.fedorkow-rats-network-device-attestation].  This concept is
   implemented, for example, in the Linux kernel where it is called the
   Linux Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) [Safford] and used to
   generates such a sequence of hash values.  A representation for
   conveyance of corresponding event logs is described in the Canonical
   Event Log [CEL] specification.  Open source solutions, for example,

Internet-Draft                    TUDA                         July 2021


   based on [RFC5209] use an IMA log to enable remote attestation
   [Steffens].

   An Attester MUST generate such an event/measurement log.

2.3.  Measurements and Digests Generated by an Attester

   A hash value of a software component is created before it is executed
   by Attesters.  These hash values are typically represented as event
   log entries referred to as measurements, which often occur in large
   quantities.  Capabilities such as Linux IMA can be used to generate
   these measurements on an Attester.  Measurements are chained by
   Attesters using a rolling hash function.  A TPM acts as a root of
   trust for storage (RTS) by providing an Extend ([TPM12], [TPM2])
   operation to feed hash values in a rolling hash function.  Each
   measurement added to the sequence of all measurements results in a
   new current digest hash value.  A TPM acts as a root of trust for
   reporting (RTR) by providing Quote ([TPM12], [TPM2]) operations to
   generate a digest of all currently extended hash values as Evidence.

   TUDA requirements on TPM primitive operations and the information
   elements processed by them are illustrated using pseudocode in
   Appendix C and D.

2.4.  Attesting Environments and Roots of Trust

   The primitive operations used to generate an initial set of
   measurements at the beginning of an Attester's boot sequence MUST be
   provided by a Root of Trust for Measurement (RTM) that is a system
   component of the Attester.  An RTM MUST be trusted via trust-
   relationships to TAs enabled by appropriate Endorsements (e.g.,EK-
   Certs).  If a Verifier cannot trust an RTM, measurements based on
   values generated by the RTM MUST be considered invalid.  At least one
   RTM MUST be accessible to the first Attesting Environment in Attester
   conducting Layered Attestation (see section 4.3. in
   [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture]).  An RTM MAY aggregate and retain
   measurements until the first RTS becomes available in a Layered
   Attestation procedure -- instead of feeding measurements into an RTS,
   instantly.  The Protection Capabilities of an RTM to also act as a
   temporary RTS MUST be trusted via trust-relationships to TAs enabled
   by appropriate Endorsements.  System components supporting the use of
   a TPM typically include such an appropriate RTM.  In general, feeding
   measurements from an initial RTM into a TPM is automated and
   separated from Protected Capabilities that provide Claims collection
   from Target Environments that are regular execution environments.  A
   TPM providing the Protection Capabilities for an isolated and
   shielded location to feed measurements into (integrity and
   confidentiality) is an appropriate RTS for TUDA.

   The primitive operations used to store and chain measurements via a
   rolling hash function MUST be provided by an appropriate root of
   trust for storage (RTS) that is a system component of the Attester.
   An RTS MUST be trusted via trust-relationships to TAs enabled by
   appropriate Endorsements (e.g.,EK-Certs).  If a Verifier cannot trust
   an RTS, Evidence generated based on digest values acquired from the
   RTS MUST be considered invalid.  An RTS MUST be accessible to all
   Attesting Environments that are chained in a Layered Attestation
   procedure.  A TPM providing the primitive operation for Extend is an
   appropriate RTM for TUDA.

   The primitive operations used to generate Evidence based on digests
   MUST be provided by roots of trust for reporting (RTR) that are
   system components of the Attester.  An RTR MUST be be trusted via
   trust-relationships to TAs enabled by appropriate Endorsements
   (e.g.,EK-Certs).  If a Verifier cannot trust an RTR, Evidence
   generated by the RTR MUST be considered invalid.  A TPM providing the
   primitive operations for Quote is an appropriate RTR for TUDA.  In a
   Composite Device (see Section 3.5. in [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture]
   conducting a Layered Attestation procedure, Attesting Environments
   MAY not be TPMs.  At least one Attesting Environment MUST be a TPM.
   At least one TPM MUST act as an RTR.  Attesting Environments that are
   not TPMs MUST NOT act as an RTR.

   A concise definition of the terms RTM, RTS, and RTR can be found in
   the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) Glossary [TCGGLOSS].  An RTS and an
   RTR are often tightly coupled.  In TUDA, a Trusted Platform Module
   (TPM, see [TPM12] and [TPM2]) takes on the roles of an RTS and an
   RTR.  The specification in this document requires the use of a TPM as
   a component of the Attester.  The protocol part of this specification
   can also be used with other RTS and RTR as long as essential
   functional requirements are satisfied (e.g., a trusted relative
   source of time, such as a tick-counter).  A sequence of Layered
   Attestation using at least an RTM, RTS, and RTR enables an
   authenticated boot sequence typically referred to as Secure Boot.

2.5.  Indeterministic Measurements

   The sequence of measurements that is extended into the RTS provided
   by a TPM may not be deterministic due to race conditions that are
   side-effects of parallelization.  Parallelization occurs, for
   example, between different isolated execution environments or
   separate software components started in a execution environment.  In
   order to enable the appraisal of Evidence in cases where sequence of
   measurement varies, a corresponding event log that records all
   measurements in sequence, such as the IMA log, has to be conveyed
   next to the Evidence as depicted in section 8.2. in
   [I-D.ietf-rats-reference-interaction-models].

   In contrast to Evidence, event logs do not necessarily have to be
   integrity protected or tamper-evident.  Event logs are conveyed to a
   Verifier in order to compute the reference values required for
   comparison with digest values (output of TPM Quote operations).
   While digest values MUST constitute Evidence, measurements in event
   logs MAY be part of Evidence, but do not have to be MAY be conveyed
   separately.  If the values in event logs or their sequence are
   tampered with before or during conveyance from an Attester to a
   Verifier, the corresponding Evidence Appraisal fails.  While this
   dependency reflects the intended behavior of RATS, integrity
   protected or tamper-evident can be beneficial or convenient in some
   usage scenarios.  Additionally, event logs my allow insights into the
   composition of an Attester and typically come with confidentiality
   requirements.

   In order to compute reference values to compare digest Claims in
   Evidence with, a Verifier MUST be able to replay the rolling hash
   function of the Extend operation provided by a TPM (see
   Section 2.4.2. in [I-D.fedorkow-rats-network-device-attestation]).

   A Verifier has to replay the event log using its own extend operation
   with an identical rolling hash function in order to generate
   reference values as outlined in section 2.4.1. of
   [I-D.fedorkow-rats-network-device-attestation].  During reply, the
   validity of each event log record MUST be appraised individually by
   the Verifier in order to infer if each started software component
   satisfies integrity requirements.  These appraisal procedures require
   Reference Integrity Measurements/Manifests (RIM) as are provided via
   [I-D.birkholz-rats-coswid-rim] or [TCGRIM].  Each RIM includes
   Reference Values that are nominal reference hash values for sets of
   software components.  The Reference Values can be compared with hash
   values about executed software components included in an event log.
   A Verifier requires an appropriate set of RIMs to compare every
   record in an event log successfully.  RIMs or other sets Reverence
   Value are supplied by Reference Value Providers as defined in the
   RATS Architecture [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture].  Corresponding
   procedures that enable a Verifier to acquire Reference Values are
   out-of-scope of this document.

3.  TUDA Principles and Requirements

   Traditional remote attestation protocols typically use bi-directional
   challenge/response interaction models.  Examples include the Platform
   Trust Service protocol [PTS] or CAVES [PRIRA], where one entity sends
   a challenge that is included inside the response to prove the
   freshness of Evidence via recentness.  The corresponding interaction
   model depicted in Section 8.1. of
   [I-D.ietf-rats-reference-interaction-models] tightly couples the

   three RATS activities of generating, conveying and appraising
   Evidence.

   Time-Based Uni-directional Attestation can decouple these three
   activities.  As a result, TUDA provides additional capabilities, such
   as:

   *  remote attestation for Attesters that might not always be able to
      reach the Internet by enabling the appraisal of past states,

   *  secure audit logs by combining the Evidence generated with
      integrity measurement logs (e.g.  IMA logs) that represent a
      detailed record of corresponding past states,

   *  the use of the uni-directional interaction model
      [I-D.ietf-rats-reference-interaction-models] that can traverse
      "diode-like" network security functions (NSF) or can be leveraged
      RESTful telemetry as enabled by the CoAP Observe option
      [RFC7252]).

3.1.  Attesting Environment Requirements

   An Attesting Environment that generates Evidence in TUDA MUST support
   three specific Protected Capabilities:

   *  Platform Configuration Registers (PCR) that can extend
      measurements consecutively and represent the sequence of
      measurements as a single digest,

   *  Restricted Signing Keys (RSK) that can only be accessed, if a
      specific signature about a set of measurements can be provided as
      authentication, and

   *  a dedicated source of (relative) time, e.g. a tick counter (a tick
      being a specific time interval, for example 10 ms).

   A TPM is capable of providing these Protected Capabilities for TUDA.

3.2.  Handle Distributor Requirements: Time Stamp Authority

   Both Evidence generation and Evidence appraisal require a Handle
   Distributor that can take on the role of a trusted Time Stamp
   Authority (TSA) as an additional third party.  Time Stamp Tokens
   (TST) included in Handles MUST be generated by Time Stamp Authority
   based on [RFC3161] that acts as the Handle Distributor.  The
   combination of a local source of time provided by a TPM (on the
   Attester) and the TST provided by the Handle Distributor (to both the
   Attester and the Verifier) enable an appropriate proof of freshness.

4.  Information Elements and Conveyance

   TUDA defines a set of information elements (IE) that represent a set
   of Claims, are generated and stored on the Attester, and are intended
   to be transferred to the Verifier in order to enable the appraisal of
   Evidence.  Each TUDA IE:

   *  MUST be encoded in the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR
      [RFC8949]) to minimize the volume of data in motion.  In this
      document, the composition of the CBOR data items that represent IE
      is described using the Concise Data Definition Language, CDDL
      [RFC8610].

   *  that requires a certain freshness SHOULD only be re-generated when
      out-dated (not fresh, but stale), which reduces the overall
      resources required from the Attester, including the usage of a
      TPM's resources (re-generation of IE is determined by their age or
      by specific state changes on the Attester, e.g., due to a reboot-
      cycle)

   *  SHOULD only be transferred when required, which reduces the amount
      of data in motion necessary to conduct remote attestation
      significantly (only IE that have changed since their last
      conveyance have to be transferred)

   *  that requires a certain freshness SHOULD be reused for multiple
      remote attestation procedures in the limits of its corresponding
      freshness-window, further reducing the load imposed on the
      Attester and corresponding TPMs.

5.  TUDA Core Concept

   Traditional Challenge/Response Remote Attestation
   [I-D.ietf-rats-reference-interaction-models] includes sending a nonce
   in the challenge to be used in ad-hoc Evidence generation.  Using the
   TPM 1.2 as an example, a corresponding nonce-challenge would be
   included within the signature created by the TPM_Quote command in
   order to prove the freshness of a response containing evidence, see
   e.g.  [PTS].

   In contrast, the TUDA protocol uses the combined output of
   TPM_CertifyInfo and TPM_TickStampBlob.  The former provides a proof
   about the Attester's state by creating Evidence that a certain key is
   bound to that state.  The latter provides proof that the Attester was
   in the specified state by using the bound key in a time operation.
   This combination enables a time-based attestation scheme.  The
   approach is based on the concepts introduced in [SCALE] and
   [SFKE2008].



Fuchs, et al.            Expires 13 January 2022               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                    TUDA                         July 2021


   Each TUDA IE has an individual time-frame, in which it is considered
   to be fresh (and therefore valid and trustworthy).  In consequence,
   each TUDA IE that composes data in motion is based on different
   methods of creation.

   As highlighted above, the freshness properties of a challenge-
   response based protocol enable implicit time-keeping via a time
   window between:

   *  the time of transmission of the nonce, and

   *  the reception of the corresponding response.

   Given the time-based attestation scheme, the freshness property of
   TUDA is equivalent to that of bi-directional challenge response
   attestation, if the point-in-time of attestation lies between:

   *  the transmission of a TUDA time-synchronization token, and

   *  the typical round-trip time between the Verifier and the Attester.

   The accuracy of this time-frame is defined by two factors:

   *  the time-synchronization between the Attester and the Handle
      Distributor.  The time between the two tickstamps acquired via the
      RoT define the scope of the maximum drift (time "left" and time
      "right" in respect to the timeline) to the handle including the
      signed timestamp, and

   *  the drift of clocks included in the RoT.

   Since the conveyance of TUDA Evidence does not rely upon a Verifier
   provided value (i.e. the nonce), the security guarantees of the
   protocol only incorporate the Handle Distributor and the RoT used.
   In consequence, TUDA Evidence can even serve as proof of integrity in
   audit logs with precise point-in-time guarantees.

5.1.  TPM Specific Terms

   PCR:  A Platform Configuration Register that is part of the TPM and
      is used to securely store and report measurements about security
      posture

   PCR-Hash:  A hash value of the security posture measurements stored
      in a TPM PCR (e.g. regarding running software instances)
      represented as a byte-string

5.2.  Certificates

   HD-CA:  The Certificate Authority that provides the certificate for
      the TSA role of a Handle Distributor (HD)

   AIK-CA:  The Certificate Authority that provides the certificate for
      the AK of the TPM.  This is the client platform credential for
      this protocol.  It is a placeholder for a specific CA and AK-Cert
      is a placeholder for the corresponding certificate, depending on
      what protocol was used.  The specific protocols are out of scope
      for this document, see also [AIK-Enrollment] and [IEEE802.1AR].

6.  The TUDA Protocol Family

   Time-Based Uni-Directional Attestation consists of the following
   seven information elements:

   Handle Distributor Certificate:  The certificate of the Handle
      Distributor that takes on the role of TSA.  The Handle Distributor
      certificate is used in a subsequent synchronization protocol
      tokens.  This certificate is signed by the HD-CA.

   AK Certificate:  A certificate about the Attestation Key (AIK) used.
      An AK-Cert may be an [IEEE802.1AR] IDevID or LDevID, depending on
      their setting of the corresponding identity property
      ([AIK-Credential], [AIK-Enrollment]; see Appendix D.2.1).

   Synchronization Token:  The reference frame for Evidence is provided
      by the relative timestamps generated by the TPM.  In order to put
      Evidence into relation with a Real Time Clock (RTC), it is
      necessary to provide a cryptographic synchronization between these
      trusted relative timestamps and the regular RTC that is a hardware
      component of the Attester.  To do so, trustable timestamps are
      acquired from a Handle Distributor.

   Restriction Info:  Evidence Generation relies on the capability of





Fuchs, et al.            Expires 13 January 2022               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                    TUDA                         July 2021


      the Rot to operate on restricted keys.  Whenever the PCR values of
      an Attesting Environment change, a new restricted key is created
      that can only be operated as long as the PCRs remain in their
      current state.

      In order to prove to the Verifier that this restricted temporary
      key actually has these properties and also to provide the PCR
      value that it is restricted, the corresponding signing
      capabilities of the RoT are used.  The TPM creates a signed
      certificate using the AK about the newly created restricted key.

   Measurement Log:  A Verifier requires the means to derive the PCRs'
      values in order to appraise the trustworthiness of an Attester.
      As such, a list of those elements that were extended into the PCRs
      is reported.  For certain environments, this step may be optional
      if a list of valid PCR configurations (in the form of RIM
      available to the Verifier) exists and no measurement log is
      required.

   Implicit Evidence:  The actual Evidence is then based on a signed
      timestamp provided by the RoT using the restricted temporary key
      that was certified in the steps above.  The signed timestamp
      generated provides the trustable assertion that at this point in
      time (with respect to the relative time of the TPM s tick counter)
      a certain configuration existed (namely the PCR values associated
      with the restricted key).  In combination with the synchronization
      token this timestamp represented in relative time can then be
      related to the real-time clock.

   Concise SWID tags:  As an option to better assess the trustworthiness
      of an Attester, a Verifier can request the reference hashes (RIM,
      sometimes called golden measurements, known-good-values, or
      nominal values) of all started software components to compare them
      with the entries in a measurement log.  References hashes
      regarding installed (and therefore running) software can be
      provided by the manufacturer via SWID tags.  SWID tags are
      provided by the Attester using the Concise SWID representation
      [I-D.ietf-sacm-coswid] and bundled into a collection (a RIM
      Manifest [I-D.birkholz-rats-coswid-rim]).

   These information elements can be sent en bloc, but it is recommended
   to retrieve them separately to save bandwidth, since these elements
   have different update cycles.  In most cases, retransmitting all
   seven information elements would result in unnecessary redundancy.

   Furthermore, in some scenarios it might be feasible not to store all
   elements on the Attester, but instead they could be retrieved from
   another location or be pre-deployed to the Verifier.  It is also



Fuchs, et al.            Expires 13 January 2022               [Page 15]

   feasible to only store public keys on the Verifier and skip
   certificate provisioning completely in order to save bandwidth and
   computation time for certificate verification.

6.1.  TUDA Information Elements Update Cycles

   An Attester can be in various states during its uptime cycles.  For
   TUDA, a subset of these states (which imply associated information)
   are important to the Evidence Generation.  The specific states
   defined are:

   *  persistent, even after a hard reboot: includes certificates that
      are associated with the endpoint itself or with services it relies
      on.

   *  volatile to a degree: may change at the beginning of each boot
      cycle.  This includes the capability of a TPM to provide relative
      time which provides the basis for the synchronization token and
      implicit attestation -- and which can reset after an Attester is
      powered off.

   *  very volatile: can change during any time of an uptime cycle
      (periods of time an Attester is powered on, starting with its boot
      sequence).  This includes the content of PCRs of a hardware RoT
      and thereby also the PCR-restricted signing keys used for
      attestation.

   Depending on this "lifetime of state", data has to be transported
   over the wire, or not.  E.g. information that does not change due to
   a reboot typically has to be transported only once between the
   Attester and the Verifier.

   There are three kinds of events that require fresh Evidence to be
   generated:

   *  The Attester completes a boot-cycle

   *  A relevant PCR changes

   *  Too much time has passed since the Evidence Generation

   The third event listed above is variable per application use case and
   also depends on the precision of the clock included in the RoT.  For
   usage scenarios, in which the Attester would periodically push
   information to be used in an audit-log, a time-frame of approximately
   one update per minute should be sufficient.  For those usage
   scenarios, where Verifiers request (pull) fresh Evidence, an
   implementation could potentially use a TPM continuously to always

   present the most freshly created Evidence.  This kind of utilization
   can result in a bottle-neck with respect to other purposes: if
   unavoidable, a periodic interval of once per ten seconds is
   recommended, which typically leaves about 80% of available TPM
   resource for other applications.

   The following diagram is based on the reference interaction model
   found in section 8.1. of [I-D.ietf-rats-reference-interaction-models]
   and is enriched with the IE update cycles defined in this section.

7.  Sync Base Protocol

   The uni-directional approach of TUDA requires evidence on how the TPM
   time represented in ticks (relative time since boot of the TPM)
   relates to the standard time provided by the TSA.  The Sync Base
   Protocol (SBP) creates evidence that binds the TPM tick time to the
   TSA timestamp.  The binding information is used by and conveyed via
   the Sync Token (TUDA IE).  There are three actions required to create
   the content of a Sync Token:

   *  At a given point in time (called "left"), a signed tickstamp
      counter value is acquired from the hardware RoT.  The hash of
      counter and signature is used as a nonce in the request directed
      at the TSA.

   *  The corresponding response includes a data-structure incorporating
      the trusted timestamp token and its signature created by the TSA.

   *  At the point-in-time the response arrives (called "right"), a
      signed tickstamp counter value is acquired from the hardware RoT
      again, using a hash of the signed TSA timestamp as a nonce.

   The three time-related values --- the relative timestamps provided by
   the hardware RoT ("left" and "right") and the TSA timestamp --- and
   their corresponding signatures are aggregated in order to create a
   corresponding Sync Token to be used as a TUDA Information Element
   that can be conveyed as evidence to a Verifier.

   The drift of a clock incorporated in the hardware RoT that drives the
   increments of the tick counter constitutes one of the triggers that
   can initiate a TUDA Information Element Update Cycle in respect to
   the freshness of the available Sync Token.

Appendix A.  REST Realization

   Each of the seven data items is defined as a media type (Section 8).
   Representations of resources for each of these media types can be
   retrieved from URIs that are defined by the respective servers
   [RFC8820].  As can be derived from the URI, the actual retrieval is
   via one of the HTTPs ([RFC7230], [RFC7540]) or CoAP [RFC7252].  How a
   client obtains these URIs is dependent on the application; e.g., CoRE
   Web links [RFC6690] can be used to obtain the relevant URIs from the
   self-description of a server, or they could be prescribed by a
   RESTCONF data model [RFC8040].

Appendix B.  SNMP Realization

   SNMPv3 (RFC 3411, [STD62]) is widely available on computers and also
   constrained devices.  To transport the TUDA information elements, an
   SNMP MIB is defined below which encodes each of the seven TUDA
   information elements into a table.  Each row in a table contains a
   single read-only columnar SNMP object of datatype OCTET-STRING.  The
   values of a set of rows in each table can be concatenated to
   reconstitute a CBOR-encoded TUDA information element.  The Verifier
   can retrieve the values for each CBOR fragment by using SNMP GetNext
   requests to "walk" each table and can decode each of the CBOR-encoded
   data items based on the corresponding CDDL [RFC8610] definition.

   Design Principles:

   1.  Over time, TUDA attestation values age and should no longer be
       used.  Every table in the TUDA MIB has a primary index with the
       value of a separate scalar cycle counter object that
       disambiguates the transition from one attestation cycle to the
       next.

Internet-Draft                    TUDA                         July 2021


   2.  Over time, the measurement log information (for example) may grow
       large.  Therefore, read-only cycle counter scalar objects in all
       TUDA MIB object groups facilitate more efficient access with SNMP
       GetNext requests.

   3.  Notifications are supported by an SNMP trap definition with all
       of the cycle counters as bindings, to alert a Verifier that a new
       attestation cycle has occurred (e.g., synchronization data,
       measurement log, etc. have been updated by adding new rows and
       possibly deleting old rows).

B.1.  Structure of TUDA MIB

   The following table summarizes the object groups, tables and their
   indexes, and conformance requirements for the TUDA MIB:

                                 Table 1

B.1.1.  Cycle Index

   A tudaV1<Group>CycleIndex is the:

   1.  first index of a row (element instance or element fragment) in
       the tudaV1<Group>Table;

   2.  identifier of an update cycle on the table, when rows were added
       and/or deleted from the table (bounded by tudaV1<Group>Cycles);
       and

   3.  binding in the tudaV1TrapV2Cycles notification for directed
       polling.

B.1.2.  Instance Index

   A tudaV1<Group>InstanceIndex is the:

   1.  second index of a row (element instance or element fragment) in
       the tudaV1<Group>Table; except for

   2.  a row in the tudaV1SyncTokenTable (that has only one instance per
       cycle).

B.1.3.  Fragment Index

   A tudaV1<Group>FragmentIndex is the:

   1.  last index of a row (always an element fragment) in the
       tudaV1<Group>Table; and

   2.  accomodation for SNMP transport mapping restrictions for large
       string elements that require fragmentation.

B.2.  Relationship to Host Resources MIB

   The General group in the TUDA MIB is analogous to the System group in
   the Host Resources MIB [RFC2790] and provides context information for
   the TUDA attestation process.

   The Verify Token group in the TUDA MIB is analogous to the Device
   group in the Host MIB and represents the verifiable state of a TPM
   device and its associated system.

   The SWID Tag group (containing a Concise SWID reference hash profile
   [I-D.ietf-sacm-coswid]) in the TUDA MIB is analogous to the Software
   Installed and Software Running groups in the Host Resources MIB
   [RFC2790].

B.3.  Relationship to Entity MIB

   The General group in the TUDA MIB is analogous to the Entity General
   group in the Entity MIB v4 [RFC6933] and provides context information
   for the TUDA attestation process.

   The SWID Tag group in the TUDA MIB is analogous to the Entity Logical
   group in the Entity MIB v4 [RFC6933].

B.4.  Relationship to Other MIBs

   The General group in the TUDA MIB is analogous to the System group in
   MIB-II [RFC1213] and the System group in the SNMPv2 MIB (RFC 3418,
   [STD62]) and provides context information for the TUDA attestation
   process.

   <CODE ENDS>

Appendix D.  Realization with TPM functions

D.1.  TPM Functions

   The following TPM structures, resources and functions are used within
   this approach.  They are based upon the TPM specifications [TPM12]
   and [TPM2].

D.1.1.  Tick-Session and Tick-Stamp

   On every boot, the TPM initializes a new Tick-Session.  Such a tick-
   session consists of a nonce that is randomly created upon each boot
   to identify the current boot-cycle -- the phase between boot-time of
   the device and shutdown or power-off -- and prevent replaying of old
   tick-session values.  The TPM uses its internal entropy source that
   guarantees virtually no collisions of the nonce values between two of
   such boot cycles.

   It further includes an internal timer that is being initialize to
   Zero on each reboot.  From this point on, the TPM increments this
   timer continuously based upon its internal secure clocking
   information until the device is powered down or set to sleep.  By its
   hardware design, the TPM will detect attacks on any of those
   properties.

   The TPM offers the function TPM_TickStampBlob, which allows the TPM
   to create a signature over the current tick-session and two
   externally provided input values.  These input values are designed to
   serve as a nonce and as payload data to be included in a
   TickStampBlob: TickstampBlob := sig(TPM-key, currentTicks || nonce ||
   externalData).

   As a result, one is able to proof that at a certain point in time
   (relative to the tick-session) after the provisioning of a certain
   nonce, some certain externalData was known and provided to the TPM.
   If an approach however requires no input values or only one input
   value (such as the use in this document) the input values can be set
   to well-known value.  The convention used within TCG specifications
   and within this document is to use twenty bytes of zero
   h'0000000000000000000000000000000000000000' as well-known value.

D.1.2.  Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs)

   The TPM is a secure cryptoprocessor that provides the ability to
   store measurements and metrics about an endpoint's configuration and
   state in a secure, tamper-proof environment.  Each of these security
   relevant metrics can be stored in a volatile Platform Configuration
   Register (PCR) inside the TPM.  These measurements can be conducted
   at any point in time, ranging from an initial BIOS boot-up sequence
   to measurements taken after hundreds of hours of uptime.

   The initial measurement is triggered by the Platforms so-called pre-
   BIOS or ROM-code.  It will conduct a measurement of the first
   loadable pieces of code; i.e.\ the BIOS.  The BIOS will in turn
   measure its Option ROMs and the BootLoader, which measures the OS-
   Kernel, which in turn measures its applications.  This describes a
   so-called measurement chain.  This typically gets recorded in a so-
   called measurement log, such that the values of the PCRs can be
   reconstructed from the individual measurements for validation.

   Via its PCRs, a TPM provides a Root of Trust that can, for example,
   support secure boot or remote attestation.  The attestation of an
   endpoint's identity or security posture is based on the content of an
   TPM's PCRs (platform integrity measurements).

D.1.3.  PCR restricted Keys

   Every key inside the TPM can be restricted in such a way that it can
   only be used if a certain set of PCRs are in a predetermined state.
   For key creation the desired state for PCRs are defined via the
   PCRInfo field inside the keyInfo parameter.  Whenever an operation
   using this key is performed, the TPM first checks whether the PCRs
   are in the correct state.  Otherwise the operation is denied by the
   TPM.

D.1.4.  CertifyInfo

   The TPM offers a command to certify the properties of a key by means
   of a signature using another key.  This includes especially the
   keyInfo which in turn includes the PCRInfo information used during
   key creation.  This way, a third party can be assured about the fact
   that a key is only usable if the PCRs are in a certain state.

D.2.1.  AIK and AIK Certificate

   Attestations are based upon a cryptographic signature performed by
   the TPM using a so-called Attestation Identity Key (AIK).  An AIK has
   the properties that it cannot be exported from a TPM and is used for
   attestations.  Trust in the AIK is established by an X.509
   Certificate emitted by a Certificate Authority.  The AIK certificate
   is either provided directly or via a so-called PrivacyCA
   [AIK-Enrollment].

   This element consists of the AIK certificate that includes the AIK's
   public key used during verification as well as the certificate chain
   up to the Root CA for validation of the AIK certificate itself.

   TUDA-Cert = [AIK-Cert, TSA-Cert]; maybe split into two for SNMP
   AIK-Cert = Cert
   TSA-Cert = Cert

                    Figure 2: TUDA-Cert element in CDDL

   The TSA-Cert is a standard certificate of the TSA.

   The AIK-Cert may be provisioned in a secure environment using
   standard means or it may follow the PrivacyCA protocols.  Figure 3
   gives a rough sketch of this protocol.  See [AIK-Enrollment] for more
   information.

   The X.509 Certificate is built from the AIK public key and the
   corresponding PKCS #7 certificate chain, as shown in Figure 3.

   Required TPM functions:

   | create_AIK_Cert(...) = {
   |   AIK = TPM_MakeIdentity()
   |   IdReq = CollateIdentityRequest(AIK,EK)
   |   IdRes = Call(AIK-CA, IdReq)
   |   AIK-Cert = TPM_ActivateIdentity(AIK, IdRes)
   | }
   |
   | /* Alternative */
   |
   | create_AIK_Cert(...) = {
   |   AIK = TPM_CreateWrapKey(Identity)
   |   AIK-Cert = Call(AIK-CA, AIK.pubkey)
   | }

D.2.2.  Synchronization Token

   The reference for Attestations are the Tick-Sessions of the TPM.  In
   order to put Attestations into relation with a Real Time Clock (RTC),
   it is necessary to provide a cryptographic synchronization between
   the tick session and the RTC.  To do so, a synchronization protocol
   is run with a Time Stamp Authority (TSA) that consists of three
   steps:

   *  The TPM creates a TickStampBlob using the AIK

   *  This TickStampBlob is used as nonce to the Timestamp of the TSA

   *  Another TickStampBlob with the AIK is created using the TSA's
      Timestamp a nonce

   The first TickStampBlob is called "left" and the second "right" in a
   reference to their position on a time-axis.

   These three elements, with the TSA's certificate factored out, form
   the synchronization token

   TUDA-Synctoken = [
     left: TickStampBlob-Output,
     timestamp: TimeStampToken,
     right: TickStampBlob-Output,
   ]

   TimeStampToken = bytes ; RFC 3161

   TickStampBlob-Output = [
     currentTicks: TPM-CURRENT-TICKS,
     sig: bytes,
   ]

   TPM-CURRENT-TICKS = [
     currentTicks: uint
     ? (
       tickRate: uint
       tickNonce: TPM-NONCE
     )
   ]
   ; Note that TickStampBlob-Output "right" can omit the values for
   ;   tickRate and tickNonce since they are the same as in "left"

   TPM-NONCE = bytes .size 20

   | create_sync_token(AIKHandle, TSA) = {
   |   ts_left = TPM_TickStampBlob(
   |       keyHandle = AIK_Handle,      /*TPM_KEY_HANDLE*/
   |       antiReplay = dummyNonce,     /*TPM_NONCE*/
   |       digestToStamp = dummyDigest  /*TPM_DIGEST*/)

   |       digestToStamp = hash(ts))    /*TPM_DIGEST*/

   |                     [ts_right.ticks.currentTicks, ts_right.sig]]
   |   /* Note: skip the nonce and tickRate field for ts_right.ticks */
   | }

                 Figure 5: Creating the Sync-Token element

D.2.3.  RestrictionInfo

   The attestation relies on the capability of the TPM to operate on
   restricted keys.  Whenever the PCR values for the machine to be
   attested change, a new restricted key is created that can only be
   operated as long as the PCRs remain in their current state.

   In order to prove to the Verifier that this restricted temporary key
   actually has these properties and also to provide the PCR value that
   it is restricted, the TPM command TPM_CertifyInfo is used.  It
   creates a signed certificate using the AIK about the newly created
   restricted key.

   This token is formed from the list of:

   *  PCR list,

   *  the newly created restricted public key, and

   *  the certificate.

D.2.4.  Measurement Log

   Similarly to regular attestations, the Verifier needs a way to
   reconstruct the PCRs' values in order to estimate the trustworthiness
   of the device.  As such, a list of those elements that were extended
   into the PCRs is reported.  Note though that for certain
   environments, this step may be optional if a list of valid PCR
   configurations exists and no measurement log is required.

D.2.5.  Implicit Attestation

   The actual attestation is then based upon a TickStampBlob using the
   restricted temporary key that was certified in the steps above.  The
   TPM-Tickstamp is executed and thereby provides evidence that at this
   point in time (with respect to the TPM internal tick-session) a
   certain configuration existed (namely the PCR values associated with
   the restricted key).  Together with the synchronization token this
   tick-related timing can then be related to the real-time clock.

   This element consists only of the TPM_TickStampBlock with no nonce.

   TUDA-Verifytoken = TickStampBlob-Output

D.2.6.  Attestation Verification Approach

   The seven TUDA information elements transport the essential content
   that is required to enable verification of the attestation statement
   at the Verifier.  The following listings illustrate the verification
   algorithm to be used at the Verifier in pseudocode.  The pseudocode
   provided covers the entire verification task.  If only a subset of
   TUDA elements changed (see Section 6.1), only the corresponding code
   listings need to be re-executed.

   | AIK_pub = verifyCert(AIK-CA, Cert.AIK-Cert)

D.3.  IE Generation Procedures for TPM 2.0

   The pseudocode below includes general operations that are conducted
   as specific TPM commands:

   *  hash() : description TBD

   *  sig() : description TBD

   *  X.509-Certificate() : description TBD

   These represent the output structure of that command in the form of a
   byte string value.

D.3.1.  AIK and AIK Certificate

   Attestations are based upon a cryptographic signature performed by
   the TPM using a so-called Attestation Identity Key (AIK).  An AIK has
   the properties that it cannot be exported from a TPM and is used for
   attestations.  Trust in the AIK is established by an X.509
   Certificate emitted by a Certificate Authority.  The AIK certificate
   is either provided directly or via a so-called PrivacyCA
   [AIK-Enrollment].

   This element consists of the AIK certificate that includes the AIK's
   public key used during verification as well as the certificate chain
   up to the Root CA for validation of the AIK certificate itself.

   TUDA-Cert = [AIK-Cert, TSA-Cert]; maybe split into two for SNMP
   AIK-Certificate = X.509-Certificate(AIK-Key,Restricted-Flag)
   TSA-Certificate = X.509-Certificate(TSA-Key, TSA-Flag)

D.3.2.  Synchronization Token

   The synchronization token uses a different TPM command, TPM2
   GetTime() instead of TPM TickStampBlob().  The TPM2 GetTime() command
   contains the clock and time information of the TPM.  The clock
   information is the equivalent of TUDA v1's tickSession information.

   TUDA-SyncToken = [
     left_GetTime = sig(AIK-Key,
                        TimeInfo = [
                          time,
                          resetCount,
                          restartCount
                        ]
                       ),
     middle_TimeStamp = sig(TSA-Key,
                            hash(left_TickStampBlob),
                            UTC-localtime
                           ),
     right_TickStampBlob = sig(AIK-Key,
                               hash(middle_TimeStamp),
                               TimeInfo = [
                                 time,
                                 resetCount,
                                 restartCount
                               ]
                              )
   ]

D.3.3.  Measurement Log

   The creation procedure is identical to Appendix D.2.4.

   Measurement-Log = [
     * [ EventName,
         PCR-Num,
         Event-Hash ]
   ]

D.3.4.  Explicit time-based Attestation

   The TUDA attestation token consists of the result of TPM2_Quote() or
   a set of TPM2_PCR_READ followed by a TPM2_GetSessionAuditDigest.  It
   proves that --- at a certain point-in-time with respect to the TPM's
   internal clock --- a certain configuration of PCRs was present, as
   denoted in the keys restriction information.

   TUDA-AttestationToken = TUDA-AttestationToken_quote / TUDA-AttestationToken_audit

   TUDA-AttestationToken_quote = sig(AIK-Key,
                                     TimeInfo = [
                                       time,
                                       resetCount,
                                       restartCount
                                     ],
                                     PCR-Selection = [ * PCR],
                                     PCR-Digest := PCRDigest
                                    )

   TUDA-AttestationToken_audit = sig(AIK-key,
                                     TimeInfo = [
                                       time,
                                       resetCount,
                                       restartCount
                                     ],
                                     Session-Digest := PCRDigest
                                    )

D.3.5.  Sync Proof

   In order to proof to the Verifier that the TPM's clock was not 'fast-
   forwarded' the result of a TPM2_GetTime() is sent after the TUDA-
   AttestationToken.

   TUDA-SyncProof = sig(AIK-Key,
                        TimeInfo = [
                          time,
                          resetCount,
                          restartCount
                        ]
                       ),
