                     Invalid TLV Handling in IS-IS
                   draft-ietf-lsr-isis-invalid-tlv-03

Abstract

   Key to the extensibility of the Intermediate System to Intermediate
   System (IS-IS) protocol has been the handling of unsupported and/or
   invalid Type/Length/Value (TLV) tuples.  Although there are explicit
   statements in existing specifications, deployment experience has
   shown that there are inconsistencies in the behavior when a TLV which
   is disallowed in a particular Protocol Data Unit (PDU) is received.

   This document discusses such cases and makes the correct behavior
   explicit in order to ensure that interoperability is maximized.

   This document updates RFC5305 and RFC6232.

1.  Introduction

   The Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocol
   [ISO10589] utilizes Type/Length/Value (TLV) encoding for all content
   in the body of Protocol Data Units (PDUs).  New extensions to the
   protocol are supported by defining new TLVs.  In order to allow
   protocol extensions to be deployed in a backwards compatible way an
   implementation is required to ignore TLVs that it does not

   understand.  This behavior is also applied to sub-TLVs [RFC5305],
   which are contained within TLVs.

   Also essential to the correct operation of the protocol is having the
   validation of PDUs be independent from the validation of the TLVs
   contained in the PDU.  PDUs which are valid must be accepted
   [ISO10589] even if an individual TLV contained within that PDU is not
   understood or is invalid in some way (e.g., incorrect syntax, data
   value out of range, etc.).

   The set of TLVs (and sub-TLVs) which are allowed in each PDU type is
   documented in the TLV Codepoints Registry established by [RFC3563]
   and updated by [RFC6233] and [RFC7356].

   This document is intended to clarify some aspects of existing
   specifications and thereby reduce the occurrence of non-conformant
   behavior seen in real world deployments.  Although behaviors
   specified in existing protocol specifications are not changed, the
   clarifications contained in this document serve as updates to RFC
   5305 (see Section 3.3) and RFC 6232 (see Section 3.4).

2.  TLV Codepoints Registry

   [RFC3563] established the IANA-managed IS-IS TLV Codepoints Registry
   for recording assigned TLV code points [TLV_CODEPOINTS].  The initial
   contents of this registry were based on [RFC3359].

   The registry includes a set of columns indicating in which PDU types
   a given TLV is allowed:

   IIH - TLV is allowed in Intermediate System to Intermediate System
   Hello (IIH) PDUs (Point-to-point and LAN)

   LSP - TLV is allowed in Link State PDUs (LSP)

   SNP - TLV is allowed in Sequence Number PDUs (SNP) (Partial Sequence
   Number PDUs (PSNP) and Complete Sequence Number PDUS (CSNP))

   Purge - TLV is allowed in LSP Purges [RFC6233]

   If "Y" is entered in a column it means the TLV is allowed in the
   corresponding PDU type.

   If "N" is entered in a column it means the TLV is not allowed in the
   corresponding PDU type.

3.  TLV Acceptance in PDUs

   This section describes the correct behavior when a PDU is received
   which contains a TLV which is specified as disallowed in the TLV
   Codepoints Registry.

3.1.  Handling of Disallowed TLVs in Received PDUs other than LSP Purges

   [ISO10589] defines the behavior required when a PDU is received
   containing a TLV which is "not recognised".  It states (see Sections
   9.5 - 9.13):

      "Any codes in a received PDU that are not
       recognised shall be ignored."

   This is the model to be followed when a TLV is received which is
   disallowed.  Therefore TLVs in a PDU (other than LSP purges) which
   are disallowed MUST be ignored and MUST NOT cause the PDU itself to
   be rejected by the receiving IS.

3.2.  Special Handling of Disallowed TLVs in Received LSP Purges

   When purging LSPs, [ISO10589] recommends (but does not require) the
   body of the LSP (i.e., all TLVs) be removed before generating the
   purge.  LSP purges which have TLVs in the body are accepted though
   any TLVs which are present are ignored.

   When cryptographic authentication [RFC5304] was introduced, this
   looseness when processing received purges had to be addressed in
   order to prevent attackers from being able to initiate a purge
   without having access to the authentication key.  [RFC5304] therefore
   imposed strict requirements on what TLVs were allowed in a purge
   (authentication only) and specified that:

      "ISes MUST NOT accept purges that contain TLVs
       other than the authentication TLV".

   This behavior was extended by [RFC6232] which introduced the Purge
   Originator Identification (POI) TLV and [RFC6233] which added the
   "Purge" column to the TLV Codepoints registry to identify all the
   TLVs which are allowed in purges.

   The behavior specified in [RFC5304] is not backwards compatible with
   the behavior defined by [ISO10589] and therefore can only be safely
   enabled when all nodes support cryptographic authentication.
   Similarly, the extensions defined by [RFC6232] are not compatible
   with the behavior defined in [RFC5304], therefore can only be safely
   enabled when all nodes support the extensions.

   When new protocol behaviors are specified that are not backwards
   compatible, it is RECOMMENDED that implementations provide controls
   for their enablement.  This serves to prevent interoperability issues
   and allow for non-disruptive introduction of the new functionality
   into an existing network.

3.3.  Applicability to sub-TLVs

   [RFC5305] introduced sub-TLVs, which are TLV tuples advertised within
   the body of a parent TLV.  Registries associated with sub-TLVs are
   associated with the TLV Codepoints Registry and specify in which TLVs
   a given sub-TLV is allowed.  Section 2 of [RFC5305] is updated by the
   following sentence:

      "As with TLVs, it is required that sub-TLVs which
       are disallowed MUST be ignored on receipt.".

   The existing sentence in Section 2 of [RFC5305] :

      "Unknown sub-TLVs are to be ignored and skipped upon
       receipt."

   is replaced by:

      "Unknown sub-TLVs MUST be ignored and skipped upon
       receipt."

3.4.  Correction to POI TLV Registry Entry

   An error was introduced by [RFC6232] when specifying in which PDUs
   the POI TLV is allowed.  Section 3 of [RFC6232] stated:

      "The POI TLV SHOULD be found in all purges and
       MUST NOT be found in LSPs with a non-zero
       Remaining Lifetime."

   However, the IANA section of the same document stated:

      "The additional values for this TLV should be
       IIH:n, LSP:y, SNP:n, and Purge:y."

   The correct setting for "LSP" is "n".  This document updates
   [RFC6232] by correcting that error.

   This document also updates the previously quoted text from Section 3
   of [RFC6232] to be:

Internet-Draft       draft-ietf-lsr-isis-invalid-tlv           July 2020


      "The POI TLV SHOULD be sent in all purges and
       MUST NOT be sent in LSPs with a non-zero
       Remaining Lifetime."

4.  TLV Validation and LSP Acceptance

   The correct format of a TLV and its associated sub-TLVs, if
   applicable, are defined in the document(s) which introduce each
   codepoint.  The definition MUST include what action to take when the
   format/content of the TLV does not conform to the specification
   (e.g., "MUST be ignored on receipt").  When making use of the
   information encoded in a given TLV (or sub-TLV) receiving nodes MUST
   verify that the TLV conforms to the standard definition.  This
   includes cases where the length of a TLV/sub-TLV is incorrect and/or
   cases where the value field does not conform to the defined
   restrictions.

   However, the unit of flooding for the IS-IS Update process is an LSP.
   The presence of a TLV (or sub-TLV) with content which does not
   conform to the relevant specification MUST NOT cause the LSP itself
   to be rejected.  Failure to follow this requirement will result in
   inconsistent LSP Databases on different nodes in the network which
   will compromise the correct operation of the protocol.

   LSP Acceptance rules are specified in [ISO10589] .  Acceptance rules
   for LSP purges are extended by [RFC5304] and [RFC5310] and are
   further extended by [RFC6233].

   [ISO10589] also specifies the behavior when an LSP is not accepted.
   This behavior is NOT altered by extensions to the LSP Acceptance
   rules i.e., regardless of the reason for the rejection of an LSP the
   Update process on the receiving router takes the same action.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add this document as a reference for the TLV
   Codepoints Registry.

   IANA is also requested to modify the entry for the Purge Originator
   Identification TLV in the TLV Codepoints Registry to be:

   IIH:n, LSP:n, SNP:n, and Purge:y.

   The reference field should be updated to point to this document.

6.  Security Considerations

   As this document makes no changes to the protocol there are no new
   security issues introduced.

   The clarifications discussed in this document are intended to make it
   less likely that implementations will incorrectly process received
   LSPs, thereby also making it less likely that a bad actor could
   exploit a faulty implementation.

   Security concerns for IS-IS are discussed in [ISO10589], [RFC5304],
   and [RFC5310].
