Abstract 
    
   While traditional mobility support deals with providing continuous 
   Internet connectivity to mobile hosts (host mobility support), 
   network mobility support means dealing with situations where an 
   entire network changes its point of attachment to the Internet. Such 
   a network is called a mobile network. This document identifies 
   architectural entities of network mobility and nested network 
   mobility.

              Architectural Requirements for Basic NEMO  October 2002 
 
 
1. Introduction 
   This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the 
   terminology defined in [1] and problem description in [2] and Mobile 
   IPv4 based description in Section 4.5 of [3]. 
    
   The purpose of traditional mobility support is to provide continuous 
   Internet connectivity to mobile hosts (host mobility support). In 
   contrast, network mobility support is concerned with situations where 
   an entire network changes its point of attachment to the Internet and 
   thus its reachability in the topology. We shall refer to such a 
   network as a mobile network. Cases of mobile networks include 
   networks attached to people (Personal Area Networks or PAN), and 
   networks of sensors deployed in aircrafts, boats, busses, cars, 
   train, etc that need a permanent Internet connection. Those mobile 
   networks may also provide Internet access to devices carried by 
   people (laptop, camera, mobile phone, etc, and PAN). 
    
   There is a desire to achieve two levels of mobility: node mobility 
   and network mobility. A passenger is a mobile node which visits a 
   mobile network (VMN in a NEMO), and passengers may themselves be 
   mobile IP-subnets (NEMO in a NEMO), for example when carrying a PAN. 
   Since people move from a NEMO to another, and since instances of 
   NEMOs like trains, car, aircrafts cross country boundaries, both VMNs 
   and NEMOs are also most likely to cross ISP boundaries and therefore 
   to move between topologically distant parts of the Internet. This 
   means we must allow VMNs belonging to potentially different 
   administrative domains to visit the NEMO.  These instances also 
   justify the need to consider potentially large NEMOs containing 
   hundreds of hosts and several routers. The train example highlights 
   that the number of correspondent nodes could also be very large, and 
   that these may be sparsely distributed in the Internet. It also 
   justifies the need for true worldwide mobility in the Internet. A 
   NEMO may attach to very distant parts of the Internet topology, 
   provided it is granted access to it, therefore requiring both Local-
   Area Mobility support and Wide-Area Mobility support. 
    
   The document continues in Section 2 with general requirements on 
   architecture. 
    
2. Architecture 
    
2.1 Generic architecture 
   A new architectural entity called mobile router (MR) is needed to 
   support network mobility. The mobile router (MR) connects the mobile 
   network to the home link. In order to provide session continuity to 
   the nodes in its network, MR needs a Mobile IP Home Agent (HA) [4]. 
   MR may have several internal links to which local fixed (LFN) and 
   mobile (LMN) nodes are connected (Figure 1). MR and HA together 
   provide support for network mobility. HA MUST know that MR is not a 
   basic mobile node but a router.

   Figure 1. A Mobile Network at its Home Link 
    
   MR has an egress interface to its home link. MR MAY have several 
   ingress interfaces to its internal links.  
    
   The mobile network MAY move in its entirety and MAY attach itself to 
   another link, e.g. foreign link. This situation is shown in Figure 2. 
   MR MUST provide session continuity to all the nodes in its network. 
    
 
   The correspondent node (CN) MAY be communicating with a mobile node 
   (LMN) or with a fixed node (LFN). Base network mobility support MUST 
   not require any changes to the correspondent nodes.

   A mobile router becomes the visiting mobile router (VMR) if it 
   connects to another network in mobility. This is called nested 
   mobility. An architecture for nested mobility is shown in Figure 3. A 
   visiting mobile router (VMR) connects itself to the network in 
   mobility by attaching to one of the links, e.g. local link 2. The 
   visiting network in mobility may have its own links to which several 
   fixed and mobile nodes are connected. HA1 is the home agent for MR 
   and HA2 is for VMR.

2.2 Mobile IPv4 Considerations 
    
   In Mobile IPv4, LMNs as well as MR MAY have a Foreign Agent (FA). The 
   FA for LMNs MUST be on the internal link(s). MR MAY act as a FA to 
   LMNs only if one of MRÆs interfaces directly connect to the internal 
   links in the mobile network. Figure 4 shows the use of Mobile IPv4 
   when the network in mobility is on a foreign link. MR uses a local FA 
   as its foreign agent while serving as FA to LMNs on the links 
   attached to its interfaces.
