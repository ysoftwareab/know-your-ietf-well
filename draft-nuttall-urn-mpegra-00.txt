Abstract 

   ISO JTC1/SC29/WG11 has published the MPEG-21 Digital Item Identification (DII)
   standard (ISO/IEC 21000-3:2003). This part of the standard defines Digital Items
   Identifiers as URIs. A registration Authority has been appointed to guarantee uniqueness
   of the registered identfiers.
   This document is the definition of the formal Uniform Resource Name (URN)
   Namespace Identifier (NID) for DIIs.  

Conventions used in this document 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119.

1. URN Namespace Definition Template 

   The following template is provided in accordance with [RFC3406]. 

1.1. Namespace ID: 

   mpegra 

1.2. Registration Information: 

   Version: 0 

   Date: 2006 02 24 

1.3. Declared registrant of the namespace: 

   Name:    CISAC (international Confederation of Societies
		of Authors and Composers)
   Address: 20-26 Blvd du Parc, 92200 Neuilly sur Seine - France 

   Contact: Mr. Eric Baptiste, Director General

Internet-Draft           mpegra URN Definition           February 2006 
    

1.4. Declaration of structure: 

   The identifier structure is as follows: 

      URN:MPEGRA:DII:<ID> 

   Where <MPEGRA> is the target namespace for an mpeg registration authority.
   The <DII> namespace will be assigned by CISAC to all registrants willing to 
   use an identifier within the DII specification (ISO/IEC 21000-3:2003).
   <ID> are RFC2141 conformant identifiers managed by a registration
   authority and are further constrained by their repsective specification. 
   Some Examples are : 

      URN:MPEGRA:DII:ISWC:T-034.524.680-1

	In this example <ISWC> uniqueness is guaranteed by the JTC1/SC29 DII registration Authority (CISAC)
	and <T-034.524.680-1> is defined in [ISO15707], is compliant with RFC2141 and its 
	uniqueness is guaranteed by the JTC1/SC9 ISWC registration Authority (CISAC)

	URN:MPEGRA:DII:ISRC:FR-Y03-03-00400
	In this example <ISRC> uniqueness is guaranteed by the JTC1/SC9 DII registration Authority (CISAC)
	and <FR-Y03-03-00400> is defined in [ISO3901:2001], is compliant with RFC2141 and its 
	uniqueness is guaranteed by the ISRC registration Authority (IFPI) and its affiliated members.

1.5. Relevant ancillary documentation: 

   DII, its syntax, uses and its processes are defined in [ISO/IEC 21000-3:2003]. 

1.6. Identifier uniqueness considerations: 

   Namespace uniqueness is guaranteed by the ISO/IEC/JTC1/SC29 DII Registration Authority. 
   Uniqueness of subsequent identifiers is guaranteed by the respective Registration Authorities
   dor these identifiers.

1.7. Identifier persistence considerations: 

   Persistence is guaranteed by ISO Registration Authority processes.

1.8. Process of identifier assignment: 

   The details of the assignment process are defined from time to time 
   by the DII Registration Authority.
   Registrants will contact the Registration Authority through a dedicated website
   (http://www.mpegra.org). Registrants are required to provide a valid urn for use
   of their identifier within the DII specificiation. Registrants will have the option
   of using the <mpegra> namesapce to reference their identifiers.
   Registrants may declare their own URNs (e.g. urn:ISBN as defined in [RFC3187].
   The DII Registration Authority will ensure that registrants are compliant with 
   [RFC2141] and provide processes to ensure identifiers uniqueness.

1.9. Process for identifier resolution: 

   MPEGRA identifiers are resolved by a direct or indirect lookup within the 
   respective Regsitration Authority of the registrants for <IDs>.

1.10. Rules for Lexical Equivalence: 

   The MPEGRA-NSS and DII sub-namspace are unique by the nature of the 
   mpeg DII registration authority.  The MPEGRA-NSS and DII are case-insensitive.
   Upper and lower case characters are treated as identical. 

1.11. Conformance with URN Syntax: 

   No special considerations. The syntax is fully conformant with 
   [RFC2141].

Internet-Draft           MPEGRA URN Definition             February 2006 
    

1.12. Validation mechanism: 

   In most cases, check digits provide syntax integrity. Lookup is via online
   and offline services provided by the respective <ID> Registration Authorities. 

1.13. Scope: Global. 

2. Formal Syntax 

   The DII reference XML sceham is published at 
   http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/MPEG-21_schema_files/dii/dii.xsd

   The following text specificies the formal syntax of DII. This syntax here
   is derived from the syntax definition in [ISO/IEC 21000-3:2003], 
   constrained to prohibit the space character as a separator. 


<MPEGRA> 	::= <DII> ":" <ID> ":" <value>

<DII>		::= <upper> | <lower>
<ID>		::= <let-num>
<value>		::= <let-num> "-" <check>
<check>     	::= <let-num>

Note: The exact syntax of <value> may vary from one identifier to another.  
<let-num>, <upper> and <lower> are defined in [RFC2141].



3. Security Considerations 

   This document only defines the syntax and resolution authority for 
   the mpegra and DII namespaces. Details of the resolution process and 
   the security of the assignment and resolution system processes are defined 
   external to this document either by the DII Registration Authority or an <ID> 
   Registration Authority and thus is outside the scope of this document. 

4. Namespace Considerations 

   In order to ensure uniqueness of its identification Scheme, MPEG 
   (ISO/IEC/JTC1/SC29/WG11) has designated CISAC as its Registration
   Authority. DII beings URIs, by definition, CISAC needs to offer a unique
   urn namespace for all entities wiling to use identifiers within MPEG-21.
   
   MPEGRA has been chosen as a generic namespace for an mpeg Registration
   Authority. The DII namespace is used to clearly identify the urn as being
   a Digital Item identifier
   
5. Community Considerations 

   MPEG-21, of which DII is a part, is a multimedia framework, in the broadest
   sense of the term. Contributors range from the Telecom, consumer electronics, 
   media industries as well as academics.
   DII being a Digital Item Identifier it is anticipated that it will broadly 
   adopted by the media Industry.

6. IANA Considerations 

   This document defines a URN NID registration that is to be entered 
   into the IANA registry of URN NIDs. It specifically requests the NID, 
   "MPEGRA".
