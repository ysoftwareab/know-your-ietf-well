 Generic Application Programming Interface (API) for Sliding Window FEC
                                 Codes
                  draft-roca-nwcrg-generic-fec-api-02

Abstract

   This document introduces a generic Application Programming Interface
   (API) for sliding window FEC codes.  This API is meant to be
   compatible with any sliding window FEC code.  It defines the core
   procedures and functions meant to control the codec (i.e.,
   implementation of the FEC code).  However, it leaves out all upper
   layer aspects that are the responsibility of the application or
   protocol making use of the codec.  As a consequence, this is not an
   API for a FEC Scheme since certain mechanisms that must be defined by
   any FEC Scheme (e.g., signalling and FEC Payload IDs) are the
   responsibility of the caller instead of being addressed by the codec.
   A first goal of this document is to pave the way for a future open-
   source implementation of such codes, another goal is to simplify the
   development of content delivery protocols that rely on sliding window
   FEC codes for robust transmissions.

1.  Introduction

   Forward Erasure Correction (FEC) codes are a key element of
   communication systems, used to efficiently recover from packet losses
   during content delivery sessions.  Among the FEC codes working at the
   network and higher layers, one can broadly distinguish block codes
   and sliding window codes.  Block FEC codes require the data flow
   coming from the application to be segmented into blocks of a
   predefined maximum size, before generating a certain number of repair
   packets.  With the second type of FEC codes, an encoding window
   continuously slides over the set of source data and repair packets
   are generated at any time by computing for instance a linear
   combination of data present in the encoding window.  This fundamental
   difference seriously impacts the way they can be used by a content
   delivery protocol or application.

   This document introduces a generic Application Programming Interface
   (API) for sliding window FEC codes.  This API is meant to be usable
   by any sliding window FEC code and FEC Scheme independently of the
   protocol that may rely on it.  This API defines the core procedures
   and functions meant to control the codec (i.e., implementation of the
   FEC code), but leaves out all upper layer aspects that are the
   responsibility of the application making use of the codec.

   leaves out all upper layer aspects that are the responsibility of the

   to end-to-end use-cases as well as those compatible with in-network
   re-encoding use-cases.  Additionally, this API is not impacted by the
   intra-flow versus inter-flow nature of the use-case, nor is it
   impacted by the single-path versus multi-paths nature of the use-
   case, since those are usage considerations under the responsibility
   of the caller.

   A goal of this document is to pave the way for a future open-source
   implementation of such codes.

3.  AL-FEC Codes and Mechanisms Considered by the Generic API

   This generic FEC API is meant to be used with:

   o  sliding window codes, that manage an encoding window (of fixed or
      variable size) that slides over the set of source symbols at the
      sender.  On the opposite, block codes (e.g., Reed-Solomon, LDPC,
      Raptor(Q)) are out of scope;
   o  codes that are restricted to use-cases that involve a single
      encoding point and a single decoding point (i.e., FEC operations
      are carried out either within the end-hosts or middle-boxes), as
      well as codes that can be used with use-cases that involve in-
      network re-coding operations;
   o  use-cases that are limited to an intra-flow coding (simple case),
      as well as use-cases that involve inter-flow coding.  This second
      case is more complex to address (e.g., with questions such as how
      to identify a packet of a flow?) however this is the
      responsibility of the application or protocol using this codec and
      not the codec itself.  This aspect is therefore transparent to the
      API;
   o  use-cases that are limited to single-path communications and use-
      cases that consider multi-path communications.  Here also this is
      a usage consideration that is transparent to the API;
   o  use-cases that involve a dynamic adaptation of the codec
      parameters (e.g., its code rate because the communication path
      losses is known thanks to feedbacks and an appropriate strategy
      can be defined);
   o  fixed code rate or not FEC codes, including rateless codes where
      the number of repair symbols that can be generated is huge (in
      theory unlimited);
   o  ideal (MDS) or non-ideal (non-MDS) codes.  However most of the
      time, sliding window codes are non-ideal codes, meaning that
      slightly more than l repair symbols may be required to recover all
      the l lost source symbols;

   A key question is to determine what mechanisms are included in the
   codec and what mechanisms are left to the responsibility of the
   caller (i.e., an application or a protocol making use of this codec)
   (Figure 1).  More precisely, an FEC Scheme (such as the RLC FEC
   Scheme [RLC] in case of FECFRAME [fecframe-ext]) defines all the
   internal code details in order to enable interoperable
   implementations, but also signaling considerations that are essential
   to use them in a specific context.

3.1.  Mechanisms Considered or Ignored by the API

   Applying FEC coding, through an FEC Scheme, in a given protocol to
   improve transmission robustness involves many mechanisms.  However,
   these mechanisms are not all the responsibility of the codec and can
   be implemented within the application or within the protocol that
   uses this FEC codec.  For instance, the following mechanisms are
   considered **out of scope of the API**, being implemented by the
   caller, without any impact on the codec:

   o  memory management;
   o  packet transmission and reception;
   o  signaling header creation / parsing;
   o  ADU to source symbol mapping;
   o  code rate adjustment, for instance thanks to the knowledge of
      losses at a receiver via feedbacks;
   o  selective ACK creation and parsing;
   o  congestion control.

   The following mechanisms are **within scope of the API**:

   o  session management (sender and receiver);
   o  encoding window management (sender and receiver);
   o  set/get/generate coding coefficients (sender and receiver);
   o  build coded symbol (sender only);
   o  decode with newly received source or repair symbol (receiver
      only);

4.  Generic API for Sliding Window FEC Codes

   The following sections describe the generic API, following a
   C-language formalism.  Everything is prefixed by "ga" (Generic API).

4.1.  General Definitions Common to the Encoder and Decoder

   This section gathers general definitions that are used by both an
   encoder and decoder.

   About FEC Codepoints:

      An application first needs to negotiate with its remote side the
      right FEC Scheme to use.  This negotiation usually relies on the
      FEC Encoding ID associated to this FEC Scheme for this
      application.  The FEC Encoding ID space, associated to an IANA
      registry, is protocol specific and the same value are usually
      associated to different FEC Schemes depending on the protocol.
      The FEC Encoding ID, from the Generic FEC API point of view,
      cannot be used to uniquely identify the codec.
      The use of a codepoint to identify locally the right FEC codec
      requires that the application knows a mapping between the FEC
      Encoding ID it uses and the local FEC Codepoints corresponding to
      available codecs.  This can be done at development time, after
      including the Generic FEC API header file, which gives access to
      the ga_codepoint_t enumeration.

<CODE BEGINS>
/**
 * Return value of any function.
 *
 * GA_STATUS_OK = 0     Success
 * GA_STATUS_FAILURE    Failure. The function called did not succeed to
 *                      perform its task, however this is not an error
 *                      (e.g., it happens when decoding fails).
 * GA_STATUS_ERROR      Generic error type. The detailed error type is
 *                      stored in the errno variable of ga_encoder_t and
 *                      ga_decoder_t structures.
 */
typedef enum {
        GA_STATUS_OK = 0,
        GA_STATUS_FAILURE,
        GA_STATUS_ERROR
} ga_status_t;


/**
 * Potential errors.

} ga_errno_t;

 * Note that the same FEC code may be used by several FEC Encoding IDs
 * and therefore share the same codepoint. On the opposite multiple
 * implementations of a given FEC code may exist locally, for instance
 * with different optimizations, and then several codepoints, one per
 * codec, will exist for the same FEC code. The following names are
 * therefore only provided as examples.
 */
typedef enum {
        GA_NULL_CODEPOINT = 0,  /* codepoint 0 is reserved */
        /* codepoint for RLC sliding window code, GF(2^8) and variable
         * density (as in FECFRAME FEC Enc. ID XXX). */

        /* codepoint for RLC sliding window code, GF(2) and variable
         * density (as in FECFRAME FEC Enc. ID YYY). */
        GA_RLC_GF_2_VAR_DENSITY_CODEC,
        /* list here other identifiers for any FEC codec of interest */
} ga_codepoint_t;
<CODE ENDS>

                           General definitions.

4.2.  Coding Window Functions at an Encoder and Decoder

   This section gathers functions used to manage the coding window, both
   at an encoder and at a decoder.  At an encoder a sliding (of fixed or
   elastic size) encoding window is managed.  Whenever a repair symbol
   needs to be created, a linear combination (that is code specific) of
   source symbols currently in the encoding window is performed.  This
   encoding window is managed with the functions below plus,
   potentially, internal mechanisms that are code specific.

   At a decoder, before submitting a new repair symbol to the codec, the
   application must specify the associated encoding window used at the
   source.  This is done by the reset/add a single or set of symbols/
   remove a symbol functions.  Once this coding window is ready, as well
   as the coding coefficient list if applicable, the application calls
   the decode_with_new_repair_symbol() function.  A coding window may be
   reused for several repair symbols as long as they are all built from
   the same set of source symbols.  In that case resetting the coding
   window and setting it from scratch would be a waste of time.  The
   coding window must be viewed as a temporary list used solely by the
   decode_with_new_repair_symbol() function and kept independent from
   the linear system managed by the codec.

<CODE BEGINS>
/**
 * This function resets the current coding window. We assume here that
 * this window is maintained by the FEC codec instance.
 * Encoder:     reset the encoding window for the encoding of future
 *              repair symbols.
 * Decoder:     reset the coding window under preparation associated to

4.3.  Coding Coefficients Functions at an Encoder and Decoder

   This section gathers functions used to manage the coding
   coefficients, both at an encoder and at a decoder.  Since different
   FEC codecs will have different requirements, it is important to keep
   these functions separate from the build_repair_symbol() and
   decode_with_new_repair_symbol() functions.  Several situations exist:

   o  the application provides the list of coding coefficients to use
      for the next build_repair_symbol();
   o  the application provides a key (typically a PRNG seed) that the
      codec uses to produce the coding coefficients to use for the next
      build_repair_symbol();
   o  the choice of the coding coefficients is totally performed by the
      codec, in an autonomous manner (e.g., the codec includes an
      algorithm that produces an appropriate seed based on various
      criteria, or the codec selects a set of coding coefficients based
      on various criteria).  In that case the application needs to
      retrieve the list of coding coefficients or the key selected by
      the codec;

<CODE BEGINS>
/**
 * The following functions enable an encoder (resp. decoder) to
 * initialize the set of coefficients to be used for encoding
 * or associated to a received repair symbol.
 *
 * Encoder: calling one of them MUST be done before calling
 *               build_repair_symbol().
 * Decoder: calling one of them MUST be done before calling
 *               decode_with_new_repair_symbol().

A.3.  Cedric API proposal

   For DRAGONCAST/DragonNet/GardiNet (<https://gitlab.inria.fr/GardiNet/
   liblc/>):

   o  an API could be globally pretty similar;
   o  there is a maintained set of symbols of the "codec" where online
      Gaussian Elimination is performed.  But this same set, is used to
      also re-code packets for generation.  For this to work, one uses
      as pivot the highest index (instead of the lowest in standard
      RREF), in order to avoid adding symbols with higher indices in the
      decoding process.
   o  another set of differences would be that the protocol has more
      control over the coding process than our current codec proposal.
      The reason is that DRAGONCAST (re)codes for several neighbors, and
      in such scenario, there is no "obvious" decision that can be made,
      for instance:

      *  which source symbols (indices) should be present in a generated
         packet: -> tradeoff: helping the maximum number of nodes
         (emphasis on "new" undecoded source symbol indices) -vs-
         helping the neighbor which is the most late in the decoding
         process (emphasis on "old" source symbols)
      *  which symbols should be kept in the decoding process (or
         dropped): -> tradeoff: helping coding by keeping old symbols
         (be able to generate symbols for late neighbors) vs keeping up
         with decoding (and never throwing away a new symbol with high
         indices).  (I.  Amdouni discussed such issues in
         <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-amdouni-nwcrg-cisew-00> for
         instance).
   o  In the current implementation, the packet generation process is
      done in the protocol which directly "peeks" in the set of symbols
      in the codec, and creates a linear combination with the ones that
      suits it.
   o  Technically the callbacks from the "codec" are:

      *  notification of a source symbol is decoded;
      *  notification that the set of symbols is full (protocol can
         remove symbols it sees fits, especially decoded symbols);
      *  for the "over-the-air" reflashing application, the codec can
