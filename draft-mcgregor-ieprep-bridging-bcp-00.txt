Abstract

   An Internet Emergency Preparedness (IEPREP) telephony service IP 
Bridging topology using Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) should 
provide Emergency Telecommunications Service (ETS) using a) Session 
Initiation Protocol (SIP) Priority header value of "emergency", b) 
Session Description Protocol (SDP) attribute experimental parameters to 
designate the call (session) as either a National Emergency call, 
International Emergency call, or both, c) MEGACO context descriptors of

priorities 1-6 and emergency indication, and d) MPLS E-LSPs with a 
dedicated codepoint specifying application of ETS Per-Hop Behavior 
(PHB). IP Differentiated Services marking should use specified code 
points allocated from the Experimental and Local Use pool (pool 2) to 
designate the traffic as either National Emergency or International 
Emergency for corresponding PHB use.  Signaling between the Signaling 
Gateway (SG) and Media Gateway Controller (MGC) should apply the MTP3 
SS7 protocol over the M2UA adaptation protocol for use of the Stream 
Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).  Support is suggested for work in 
progress on defining a SIP Resource Priority header and defining a SIP 
telephone url extension for calling party category designation.

Internet-Draft     IEPREP IP Bridging MPLS BCP                June 2003

1. Introduction

The Internet Emergency Preparedness (IEPREP) Working Group charter 
notes that effective telecommunications capabilities are imperative to 
facilitate immediate recovery operations for serious disaster events, 
and that the Internet community needs to consider how it can best
support emergency management and recovery operations.  This document 
presents recommendations for Emergency Telecommunications Service (ETS) 
telephony application design with existing protocols in an IP Bridging 
topology. 

User requirements for IP-based networks to enable and support an 
authorized emergency telecommunications service (ETS)for use by 
authorities to organize and coordinate emergency and disaster relief 
operations are described in [IEPREP Rqmts].  It provides a basis from 
which ETS can be negotiated to provide user-acceptable communications.  
The requirements relate to user expectation and are general, 
functional, and intended to provide wide latitude in implementation 
options.  

A framework for supporting authorized emergency related communication 
within the context of IP telephony has been presented in [IEPREP 
Frame].     The framework includes a series of objectives that reflect 
a general view of how authorized emergency service, in line with the 
Emergency   Telecommunications Service (ETS), should be realized within 
today's IP architecture and service models.  From these objectives, a 
corresponding set of protocols and capabilities are presented which 
provide a more specific set of recommendations regarding existing IETF 
protocols.  This current paper builds on the framework to provide 
specific guidance for implementing an ETS using existing protocols.

This document makes a distinction between National Emergency 
applications and International Emergency applications based on the 
notion that different countries may require different ETS treatments 
for national versus international emergency applications.  (In both 
cases, the applications are assumed to be within the context of 
authorized and authenticated uses for official purposes versus the more 
commonly considered public emergency service.)  Within the USA, 
National Emergency telephony applications are recognized in SS7 call 
setup by the Initial Address Message (IAM) Calling Party Category (CPC) 
being set to the High Probability of Completion (HPC) codepoint as 
specified in [ANSI HPC].  When National Emergency applications are 
noted below, it is assumed that the call has been recognized as such by 
some mechanism like HPC.  Similarly, the ITU is addressing how to 
signal international emergency calls [ITU IEPS] and the same assumption 
of recognition is applied.

1.1 Motivation

The motivation for this draft is to initiate work on providing 
appropriate guidance to the international community on the design of 
Emergency Telecommunications Service (ETS) telephony applications using 
existing protocols.

1.2 Terms and Definitions

The following acronyms are exploded for clarity:

      AT = Access Tandem
      
      CSN = Circuit Switched Network

      EF = Expedited Forwarding

      E-LSP = EXP-inferred-PSC LSPs

      EXP = field in MPLS label

      GW  = Gateway (CSN to IP, or IP to CSN)

      LSP = Label Switched Path

      LSR = Label Switching Router

      MG = Media Gateway

2. IP Bridging Topology

The IP Bridging Topology is defined in [IEPREP Term] and is sometimes 
known as "IP in the Middle" of two CSNs.  In this topology, a CSN phone 
of any type initiates (dials) a call to another CSN phone with an IP 
core between the two CSNs.

This topology should simplistically look like this:

                     Figure 1. Topology "IP Bridging"


For the purposes of this document, the topology is further elaborated 
to explode the CSN elements into ATs and STPs, and to explode the IP 
segment into access and egress SGs, MGs, and MGCs, and to show core 
LSRs, as portrayed below in Figure 2.

                     Figure 2. Exploded Topology "IP Bridging"

This explosion is intended to portray a possible CSN Local Exchange 
Carrier transiting an IP Interexchange Carrier.  Note that although the 
topology shows the SG connected directly to the MGC and the MGC 
connected directly to the MG, these connections should be viewed as 
logical connections physically formed by LSPs through the LSRs, with 
the SG, MGC, and MG all actually connected to the LSR.

The baseline telephony application design for this topology is assumed 
to be bearer traffic from AT to MG and MG to AT via conventional TDM 
trunks and from MG to LSR to LSR to MG via LSPs providing EF PHB 
supporting RTP media exchange between the MGs.  The signaling is 
assumed to be conventional SS7 [SS7] from AT to STP to SG and SS7 over 
IP using M2UA [M2UA] over SCTP [SCTP] between the SG and MGC.  The MGC 
is assumed to signal with the MG using MEGACO [MEGACO], and signaling 
between the MGCs is assumed to be SIP [SIP] with telephony extensions 
[SIP-T].

3.  MLPS LSPs

The recommended practice is to separate ETS traffic treatment from 
other traffic treatment by the use of a dedicated codepoint in E-LSPs 
to specify application of an ETS PHB versus dedicating LSPs to ETS.  It 
is recognized that MPLS LSPs [MPLS] have very limited resources for 
traffic differentiation, and allocating a significant part of the 
resources for the nominally rare but occasionally heavy ETS traffic may 
be viewed as wasteful.  However, the alternative of creating a separate 
ETS topology of LSPs presents greater difficulties because of the 
ubiquitous requirement for ETS support coupled with its rare use 
leading to significant maintenance and operating challenges.  It is 
thought to be much more efficient and less painful to maintain an 
enhancement on commonly used LSPs than to maintain a complete set of 
duplicate LSPs. 

E-LSPs [MPLS Diff] are recommended as the basic MPLS resource between 
nodes for ease of maintenance and effective scaling.  Within E-LSPs, 
assignment of PHBs to the eight Differentiated Services codepoints is a 
matter of local administration.  The recommended practice is that one 
of the codepoints (6) be dedicated to an ETS PHB.

The ETS PHB is not a standard PHB and hence is also a matter of local 
administration.  It is suggested that an ETS PHB be documented for 
development as an RFC. 

4.  SIP

SIP [SIP] has a Priority header field to indicate the urgency of the 
request as perceived by the client.  The Priority header field 
describes the priority that the SIP request should have to the 
receiving human or its agent.  For example, it may be factored into 
decisions about call routing and acceptance.  For these decisions, a 
message containing no Priority header field SHOULD be treated as if it 
specified a Priority  of "normal".  The Priority header field does not 
influence the use of communications resources such as packet forwarding 
priority in routers or access to circuits in PSTN gateways, and hence 
is of limited relevance in configuring an ETS.  The header field can 
have the values "non-urgent", "normal", "urgent", and "emergency", but 
additional values can be defined elsewhere.  Consistent with the 
RECOMMENDED practice that the value of "emergency" only be used when 
life, limb, or property are in imminent danger, the recommended 
practices is that ETS calls be pecified as "emergency".

As noted in [SIP Pri], currently SIP does not include a mechanism that 
allows a request originator to indicate to SIP element that it wishes 
the request to invoke resource prioritization. (The SIP Priority header 
field described above deals only with user perception.)  To address 
this need, the referenced work in progress adds a SIP protocol element 
that labels certain SIP requests. In particular, a new SIP header field 
for communications resource priority, called Resource-Priority, is


McGregor et al       Expires December 23, 2003                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft     IEPREP IP Bridging MPLS BCP                June 2003


documented. This header field, once achieving RFC status, MAY be used 
by SIP user agents, including gateways, to influence their treatment of 
SIP requests, including the priority afforded to ETS calls. For 
gateways interfacing to CSNs, the behavior translates into analogous 
schemes in the CSN, in both the CSN-to-IP and IP-to-CSN directions.

The referenced work in progress describes the syntax of the Resource-
Priority header field as follows:


        Resource-Priority _  "Resource-Priority" HCOLON Resource-value
        Resource-value    _  namespace "." priority
        namespace         _  alphanum / "-"
        priority          _  alphanum / "-"


        Resource-Priority: namespace.priority


The Resource-value parameter in the Resource-Priority header indicates 
the resource priority desired by the request originator.

The resource value is formatted as "namespace" "." "priority value".

   The value is drawn from the namespace identified by the namespace   
token. Namespaces and priorities are case-independent ASCII. Each   
namespace has at least one priority value.  Namespaces and priority
values within each namespace are to be registered with IANA.  

This paper suggests support be given to the referenced work in progress 
and that an "ets" namespace be suggested for inclusion in it.  The 
"ets" namespace would have priority values of 1,2,3,4,5,6 where 1 is 
the highest priority and 6 is the lowest priority.  Priorities 1-5 are 
to be administered in alignment with the five priorities specified by 
the wireless community for Wireless Priority Service [WPS].  Priority 6 
is to be used for all other calls. The alignment with the Wireless 
Priority Service will enable direct IP support for priority wireless 
call transport.  Where wireless calls interwork with CSNs before 
reaching the IP transit network, the WPS priority signaling has not yet 
been definitized, although use of MLPP [MLPP] signaling appears to be 
attractive.

The SIP is used to signal call setup between MGCs.  Telephony 
extensions to SIP permit use of a telephone number URL in the "From" 
field, e.g.,

    From: tel:123-456-7890

Currently work is in progress [SIP CPC] to add the Calling Party 
Category (CPC) as an extension to this form of url, permitting the SS7 
CPC HPC value to be mapped as:

McGregor et al       Expires December 23, 2003                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft     IEPREP IP Bridging MPLS BCP                June 2003


From: tel:123-456-7890;cpc=priority

This work will greatly simplify call setup priority treatment of HPC 
calls providing a direct mapping of the SS7 IAM CPC parameter as part 
of SIP.  To the extent that the SIP Resource Priority header provides 
an ETS priority, the url cpc parameter may appear redundant and more 
limited.  However, the direct IAM û SIP parameter mapping is viewed as 
sufficiently valuable to justify independent support.  

The SIP url cpc parameter does not yet appear to have reached RFC 
status, and the general guidance on use of the telephone url is to 
disregard the url if any parameter is not recognized.  Accordingly, it 
is suggested that support be given to standardizing the cpc parameter, 
but that it not be used until it is standardized.


5.  MEGACO

The MEGACO [MEGACO] protocol provides the means for the MGC to specify 
the interconnection of traffic between a TDM circuit and an RTP session 
at the MG.  MEGACO includes a ContextRequest parameter for "priority" 
and a ContextRequest parameter (Boolean) to indicate "emergency". Both 
parameters are optional.  

The priority is used for a context in order to provide the MG with      
information about a certain precedence handling for a context. The      
MGC can also use the priority to control autonomously the traffic      
precedence in the MG in a smooth way in certain situations (e.g.      
restart), when a lot of contexts must be handled simultaneously.

The "priority" parameter is specified to have a range of priority 
values 0-15.  This ETS paper recommends the practice of the ETS using 
priorities 1-6 in alignment with the SIP Resource-Priority header and 
Wireless Priority Service conventions described in Section 4.  Priority 
value 0 should be reserved.  It is suggested that work be initiated to 
establish these assignments as standard.

The indicator for an emergency call is provided to allow a preference 
handling in the MG.  This ETS paper recommends the practice of applying 
the "emergency" indicator for ETS calls.


6.  SDP Attributes

When a call is initiated, the SDP is applied to describe the session 
request between MGCs and between the MGC and MG (as a MEGACO variant).  
The SDP [SDP] provides the means to ascribe to a session a set of 
attributes by use of the attribute parameter.  Values (character 
strings) for the attribute parameter may be drawn from the set of 
standard values with corresponding standard interpretations, or be 

McGregor et al       Expires December 23, 2003                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft     IEPREP IP Bridging MPLS BCP                June 2003

chosen in accordance with local administration with local 
interpretation (as long as they do not conflict with a standard value). 
The recommended practice is to specify ETS sessions as either National 
Emergency sessions using the attribute parameter value "x-NatETS" 
(where the leading "x" is understood to be customary to designate non-
standard values) or International Emergency sessions using the 
attribute parameter value "x-IntETS".  It is suggested that an effort 
be initiated to standardize these attribute values.

The rationale for including an ETS designation via the SDP attribute 
parameter is that certain session treatments may be influenced by 
recognition of the session as an ETS session and that inclusion in the 
session description can be more general in application than telephony.


7.  Differentiated Services Code Points

The Differentiated Services [Diff Serv] field of the IP packet has its 
range of codepoints divided into three pools, the second of which is 
designated for experimental and local use.  The recommended practice is 
to assign two values from this pool to designate International 
Emergency and National Emergency service differentiations.  More 
precisely, the following two values are recommended, subject to 
confirmation that they do not conflict with any other known 
assignments:

      National Emergency      = 011111
      International Emergency = 011011

It is suggested that work be initiated to standardize Differentiated 
Services codepoints for International Emergency and National Emergency 
traffic.

It is recommended that the two Differentiated Services codepoints map 
into the common ETS MPLS Differentiated Services codepoint.  The 
distinct IP level codepoints are expected to be of some use in 
providing differentiated services between the two types of traffic upon 
egress from (and possibly access to) the LSPs.  (This will be more true 
in topologies other than the IP Bridging topology considered here.)

It should be noted that Differentiated Services reflexivity is the 
subject or work in progress [IEPREP Reflex] and it is suggested here 
that such work be supported.


8.  Signaling 

The signaling between the CSN segment and IP segment for the topology 
under consideration is SS7.  To provide ETS service to calls signaled 
over this interface, either a designation mechanism must be applied in 
the SS7 IAM message, or the signaling must be known to relate to ETS 
calls (e.g., by virtue of the dedicated CSN ETS facilities over which

McGregor et al       Expires December 23, 2003                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft     IEPREP IP Bridging MPLS BCP                June 2003

the signaling is arriving).  Within the USA, the IAM Calling party 
Category (CPC) High Probability of Completion (HPC) codepoint is used 
to signal calls as ETS.  

When a SG receives a call recognized as an ETS call (e.g., by the IAM 
CPC HPC codepoint), it must signal this recognition to the MGC.  It is 
recommended that this signaling be accomplished by use of the SS7 ISUP 
IAM message communicated over SS7 MTP3 over M2UA over SCTP over IP.  
The IAM being sent should apply the same mechanism as used to identify 
an ETS call as the IAM being received (e.g., the HPC codepoint).  
Similarly the MTP3 congestion priority assigned to the IAM being sent 
should be the same as the congestion priority on the IAM being received 
(e.g., in the USA, IAMs with HPC set have a congestion priority of 1 
where all other IAMs have a lower congestion priority of zero). 

The IAM should be sent from the SG to the MGC over an E-LSP using the 
EXP ETS codepoint.


9. Security Considerations

Where an ETS call is carried from PSTN to PSTN via one telephony 
carrier's backbone IP network, as considered here, very little IP-
specific security support is required.  The user is assumed to have 
authenticated his entitlement to ETS service in the originating CSN 
segment and the indication of the call as an ETS call across the CSN to 
IP interface is presumed to be without issue at this time.

Conversely, the gateway back into the CSN must similarly signal the 
call as an ETS call. A secure link between the gateways may be set up 
using IPSec or SIP security functionality. 
   

10. IANA Considerations

   This document introduces several names and values that can be 
locally administered, but which are suggested as considerations for 
IANA.  In particular:

- An SIP Priority Resource header namespace of "ets" and priority 
values of 1-6 be specified for ETS (assuming the work in progress 
becomes an RFC).

- The MEGACO priority descriptor values 1-6 be assigned for ETS 
application.

- SDP attribute values of "NatETS" and "IntETS" be specified.

    -  Differntiated Services codepoints of National Emergency = 011111
      and International Emergency = 011011 be specified.

It is suggested that work be initiated to register such names and 
values with IANA.
