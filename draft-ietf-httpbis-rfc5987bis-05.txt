    Indicating Character Encoding and Language for HTTP Header Field

Abstract

   By default, header field values in Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
   messages cannot easily carry characters outside the US-ASCII coded
   character set.  RFC 2231 defines an encoding mechanism for use in
   parameters inside Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) header
   field values.  This document specifies an encoding suitable for use
   in HTTP header fields that is compatible with a simplified profile of
   the encoding defined in RFC 2231.

   This document obsoletes RFC 5987.

Internet-Draft      Charset/Language Encoding in HTTP         March 2017


1.  Introduction

   Use of characters outside the US-ASCII coded character set
   ([RFC0020]) in HTTP header fields ([RFC7230]) is non-trivial:

   o  The HTTP specification discourages use of non-US-ASCII characters
      in field values, placing them into the "obs-text" ABNF production
      ([RFC7230], Section 3.2).

   o  Furthermore, it stays silent about default character encoding
      schemes for field values, so any use of non-US-ASCII characters
      would need to be specific to the field definition, or would
      require some other kind of out-of-band information.

   o  Finally, some APIs assume a default character encoding scheme in
      order to map from the octet sequences (obtained from the HTTP
      message) to character sequences: for instance, the XMLHttpRequest
      API ([XMLHttpRequest]) uses the Interface Definition Language type
      "ByteString", effectively resulting in the ISO-8859-1 character
      encoding scheme [ISO-8859-1] being used.

   On the other hand, RFC 2231 defines an encoding mechanism for
   parameters inside MIME header fields ([RFC2231]), which, as opposed
   to HTTP messages, do need to be sent over non-binary transports.
   This document specifies an encoding suitable for use in HTTP header
   fields that is compatible with a simplified profile of the encoding
   defined in RFC 2231.  It can be applied to any HTTP header field that
   uses the common "parameter" ("name=value") syntax.

   This document obsoletes [RFC5987] and moves it to "historic" status;
   the changes are summarized in Appendix A.

      Note: in the remainder of this document, RFC 2231 is only
      referenced for the purpose of explaining the choice of features
      that were adopted; they are therefore purely informative.

      Note: this encoding does not apply to message payloads transmitted
      over HTTP, such as when using the media type "multipart/form-data"
      ([RFC7578]).

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This specification uses the ABNF (Augmented Backus-Naur Form)
   notation defined in [RFC5234].  The following core rules are included



Reschke                 Expires September 3, 2017               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft      Charset/Language Encoding in HTTP         March 2017


   by reference, as defined in [RFC5234], Appendix B.1: ALPHA (letters),
   DIGIT (decimal 0-9), HEXDIG (hexadecimal 0-9/A-F/a-f), and LWSP
   (linear whitespace).

   This specification uses terminology defined in [RFC6365], namely:
   "character encoding scheme" (below abbreviated to "character
   encoding"), "charset" and "coded character set".

   Note that this differs from RFC 2231, which uses the term "character
   set" for "character encoding scheme".

3.  Comparison to RFC 2231 and Definition of the Encoding

   RFC 2231 defines several extensions to MIME.  The sections below
   discuss if and how they apply to HTTP header fields.

   In short:

   o  Parameter Continuations aren't needed (Section 3.1),

   o  Character Encoding and Language Information are useful, therefore
      a simple subset is specified (Section 3.2), and

   o  Language Specifications in Encoded Words aren't needed
      (Section 3.3).

3.1.  Parameter Continuations

   Section 3 of [RFC2231] defines a mechanism that deals with the length
   limitations that apply to MIME headers.  These limitations do not
   apply to HTTP ([RFC7231], Appendix A.6).

   Thus, parameter continuations are not part of the encoding defined by
   this specification.

3.2.  Parameter Value Character Encoding and Language Information

   Section 4 of [RFC2231] specifies how to embed language information
   into parameter values, and also how to encode non-ASCII characters,
   dealing with restrictions both in MIME and HTTP header field
   parameters.

   However, RFC 2231 does not specify a mandatory-to-implement character
   encoding, making it hard for senders to decide which encoding to use.
   Thus, recipients implementing this specification MUST support the
   "UTF-8" character encoding [RFC3629].

   Furthermore, RFC 2231 allows the character encoding information to be



Reschke                 Expires September 3, 2017               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft      Charset/Language Encoding in HTTP         March 2017


   left out.  The encoding defined by this specification does not allow
   that.

3.2.1.  Definition

   The presence of extended parameter values usually is indicated by a
   parameter name ending in an asterisk character.  Note however that
   this is just a convention, and that it needs to be explicitly
   specified in the definition of the header field using this extension
   (see Section 4).

   The ABNF for extended parameter values is specified below:

     ext-value     = charset  "'" [ language ] "'" value-chars
                   ; like RFC 2231's <extended-initial-value>
                   ; (see [RFC2231], Section 7)

     charset       = "UTF-8" / mime-charset

     mime-charset  = 1*mime-charsetc
     mime-charsetc = ALPHA / DIGIT
                   / "!" / "#" / "$" / "%" / "&"
                   / "+" / "-" / "^" / "_" / "`"
                   / "{" / "}" / "~"
                   ; as <mime-charset> in Section 2.3 of [RFC2978]
                   ; except that the single quote is not included
                   ; SHOULD be registered in the IANA charset registry

     language      = <Language-Tag, see [RFC5646], Section 2.1>

     value-chars   = *( pct-encoded / attr-char )

     pct-encoded   = "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG
                   ; see [RFC3986], Section 2.1

     attr-char     = ALPHA / DIGIT
                   / "!" / "#" / "$" / "&" / "+" / "-" / "."
                   / "^" / "_" / "`" / "|" / "~"
                   ; token except ( "*" / "'" / "%" )

   The value part of an extended parameter (ext-value) is a token that
   consists of three parts:

   1.  the REQUIRED character encoding name (charset),

   2.  the OPTIONAL language information (language), and





Reschke                 Expires September 3, 2017               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft      Charset/Language Encoding in HTTP         March 2017


   3.  a character sequence representing the actual value (value-chars),
       separated by single quote characters.

   Note that both character encoding names and language tags are
   restricted to the US-ASCII coded character set, and are matched case-
   insensitively (see [RFC2978], Section 2.3 and [RFC5646], Section
   2.1.1).

   Inside the value part, characters not contained in attr-char are
   encoded into an octet sequence using the specified character
   encoding.  That octet sequence is then percent-encoded as specified
   in Section 2.1 of [RFC3986].

   Producers MUST use the "UTF-8" ([RFC3629]) character encoding.
   Extension character encodings (mime-charset) are reserved for future
   use.

      Note: recipients should be prepared to handle encoding errors,
      such as malformed or incomplete percent escape sequences, or non-
      decodable octet sequences, in a robust manner.  This specification
      does not mandate any specific behavior, for instance, the
      following strategies are all acceptable:

      *  ignoring the parameter,

      *  stripping a non-decodable octet sequence,

      *  substituting a non-decodable octet sequence by a replacement
         character, such as the Unicode character U+FFFD (Replacement
         Character).

3.2.2.  Historical Notes

   The RFC 7230 token production ([RFC7230], Section 3.2.6) differs from
   the production used in RFC 2231 (imported from Section 5.1 of
   [RFC2045]) in that curly braces ("{" and "}") are excluded.  Thus,
   these two characters are excluded from the attr-char production as
   well.

   The <mime-charset> ABNF defined here differs from the one in Section
   2.3 of [RFC2978] in that it does not allow the single quote character
   (see also RFC Errata ID 1912 [Err1912]).  In practice, no character
   encoding names using that character have been registered at the time
   of this writing.

   For backwards compatibility with RFC 2231, the encoding defined by
   this specification deviates from common parameter syntax in that the
   quoted-string notation is not allowed.  Implementations using generic

Internet-Draft      Charset/Language Encoding in HTTP         March 2017


   parser components might not be able to detect the use of quoted-
   string notation and thus might accept that format, although invalid,
   as well.

   [RFC5987] did require support for ISO-8859-1 ([ISO-8859-1]), too; for
   compatibility with legacy code, recipients are encouraged to support
   this encoding as well.

3.2.3.  Examples

   Non-extended notation, using "token":

     foo: bar; title=Economy

   Non-extended notation, using "quoted-string":

     foo: bar; title="US-$ rates"

   Extended notation, using the Unicode character U+00A3 ("£", POUND
   SIGN):

     foo: bar; title*=utf-8'en'%C2%A3%20rates

   Note: the Unicode pound sign character U+00A3 was encoded into the
   octet sequence C2 A3 using the UTF-8 character encoding, then
   percent-encoded.  Also, note that the space character was encoded as
   %20, as it is not contained in attr-char.

   Extended notation, using the Unicode characters U+00A3 ("£", POUND
   SIGN) and U+20AC ("€", EURO SIGN):

     foo: bar; title*=UTF-8''%c2%a3%20and%20%e2%82%ac%20rates

   Note: the Unicode pound sign character U+00A3 was encoded into the
   octet sequence C2 A3 using the UTF-8 character encoding, then
   percent-encoded.  Likewise, the Unicode euro sign character U+20AC
   was encoded into the octet sequence E2 82 AC, then percent-encoded.
   Also note that HEXDIG allows both lowercase and uppercase characters,
   so recipients must understand both, and that the language information
   is optional, while the character encoding is not.

3.3.  Language Specification in Encoded Words

   Section 5 of [RFC2231] extends the encoding defined in [RFC2047] to
   also support language specification in encoded words.  RFC 2616, the
   now-obsolete HTTP/1.1 specification, did refer to RFC 2047
   ([RFC2616], Section 2.2).  However, it wasn't clear to which header
   field it applied.  Consequently, the current revision of the HTTP/1.1



Reschke                 Expires September 3, 2017               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft      Charset/Language Encoding in HTTP         March 2017


   specification has deprecated use of the encoding forms defined in RFC
   2047 (see Section 3.2.4 of [RFC7230]).

   Thus, this specification does not include this feature.

4.  Guidelines for Usage in HTTP Header Field Definitions

   Specifications of HTTP header fields that use the extensions defined
   in Section 3.2 ought to clearly state that.  A simple way to achieve
   this is to normatively reference this specification, and to include
   the ext-value production into the ABNF for specific header field
   parameters.

   For instance:

     foo         = token ";" LWSP title-param
     title-param = "title" LWSP "=" LWSP value
                 / "title*" LWSP "=" LWSP ext-value
     ext-value   = <see draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc5987bis, Section 3.2>

   [[pub: Upon publication as RFC, the string
   "draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc5987bis" needs to be replaced with the RFC
   name, and this comment needs to be removed.]]

      Note: The Parameter Value Continuation feature defined in Section
      3 of [RFC2231] makes it impossible to have multiple instances of
      extended parameters with identical names, as the processing of
      continuations would become ambiguous.  Thus, specifications using
      this extension are advised to disallow this case for compatibility
      with RFC 2231.

      Note: This specification does not automatically assign a new
      interpretation to parameter names ending in an asterisk.  As
      pointed out above, it's up to the specification for the non-
      extended parameter to "opt in" to the syntax defined here.  That
      being said, some existing implementations are known to
      automatically switch to the use of this notation when a parameter
      name ends with an asterisk, thus using parameter names ending in
      an asterisk for something else is likely to cause interoperability
      problems.

4.1.  When to Use the Extension

   Section 4.2 of [RFC2277] requires that protocol elements containing
   human-readable text are able to carry language information.  Thus,
   the ext-value production ought to be always used when the parameter
   value is of textual nature and its language is known.




Reschke                 Expires September 3, 2017               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft      Charset/Language Encoding in HTTP         March 2017


   Furthermore, the extension ought to also be used whenever the
   parameter value needs to carry characters not present in the US-ASCII
   ([RFC0020]) coded character set (note that it would be unacceptable
   to define a new parameter that would be restricted to a subset of the
   Unicode character set).

4.2.  Error Handling

   Header field specifications need to define whether multiple instances
   of parameters with identical names are allowed, and how they should
   be processed.  This specification suggests that a parameter using the
   extended syntax takes precedence.  This would allow producers to use
   both formats without breaking recipients that do not understand the
   extended syntax yet.

   Example:

     foo: bar; title="EURO exchange rates";
               title*=utf-8''%e2%82%ac%20exchange%20rates

   In this case, the sender provides an ASCII version of the title for
   legacy recipients, but also includes an internationalized version for
   recipients understanding this specification -- the latter obviously
   ought to prefer the new syntax over the old one.

5.  Security Considerations

   The format described in this document makes it possible to transport
   non-ASCII characters, and thus enables character "spoofing"
   scenarios, in which a displayed value appears to be something other
   than it is.

   Furthermore, there are known attack scenarios relating to decoding
   UTF-8.

   See Section 10 of [RFC3629] for more information on both topics.

   In addition, the extension specified in this document makes it
   possible to transport multiple language variants for a single
   parameter, and such use might allow spoofing attacks, where different
   language versions of the same parameter are not equivalent.  Whether
   this attack is useful as an attack depends on the parameter
   specified.

6.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA Considerations related to this specification.

Appendix A.  Changes from RFC 5987

   This section summarizes the changes compared to [RFC5987]:

   o  The document title was changed to "Indicating Character Encoding
      and Language for HTTP Header Field Parameters".

   o  The introduction was rewritten to better explain the issues around
      non-ASCII characters in field values.

   o  The requirement to support the "ISO-8859-1" encoding was removed.

   o  The document does not attempt to re-define a generic "parameter"
      ABNF anymore (it turned out that there really isn't a generic
      definition of parameters in HTTP; for instance, there are subtle

      differences with respect to whitespace handling).

   o  A note about defects in error handling in current implementations
      was removed, as it wasn't accurate anymore.

Appendix B.  Implementation Report

   The encoding defined in this document currently is used in four
   different HTTP header fields:

   o  "Authentication-Control", defined in [RFC8053],

   o  "Authorization" (as used in HTTP Digest Authentication, defined in
      [RFC7616]),

   o  "Content-Disposition", defined in [RFC6266], and

   o  "Link", defined in [RFC5988].

   As the encoding is a profile/clarification of the one defined in
   [RFC2231] in 1997, many user agents already supported it for use in
   "Content-Disposition" when [RFC5987] got published.

   Since the publication of [RFC5987], three more popular desktop user
   agents have added support for this encoding; see <http://purl.org/
   NET/http/content-disposition-tests#encoding-2231-char> for details.
   At this time, the current versions of all major desktop user agents
   support it.

   Note that the implementation in Internet Explorer 9 does not support
   the ISO-8859-1 character encoding; this document revision
   acknowledges that UTF-8 is sufficient for expressing all code points,
   and removes the requirement to support ISO-8859-1.

   The "Link" header field, on the other hand, was more recently
   specified in [RFC5988].  At the time of this writing, no User Agent
   except Firefox supported the "title*" parameter (starting with
   release 15).

   Section 3.4 of [RFC7616] defines the "username*" parameter for use in
   HTTP Digest Authentication.  At the time of writing, no User Agent
   implemented this extension.
