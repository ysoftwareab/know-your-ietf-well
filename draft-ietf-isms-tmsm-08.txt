Internet-Draft          SNMP Transport Subsystem                May 2007


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a Transport Subsystem, extending the Simple
   Network Management Protocol (SNMP) architecture defined in [RFC3411].
   This document identifies and describes some key aspects that need to
   be considered for any Transport Model for SNMP.

1.1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

1.2.  Where this Extension Fits

   It is expected that readers of this document will have read RFC3410
   and RFC3411, and have a general understanding of the functionality
   defined in RFCs 3412-3418.

   The "Transport Subsystem" is an additional component for the SNMP
   Engine depicted in RFC3411, section 3.1.

   The transport mappings defined in RFC3417 do not provide lower-layer
   security functionality, and thus do not provide transport-specific
   security parameters.  This document updates RFC3411 and RFC3417 by
   defining an architectural extension and ASIs that transport mappings
   (models) can use to pass transport-specific security parameters to
   other subsystems, including transport-specific security parameters
   translated into the transport-independent securityName and
   securityLevel.

1.3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The key words "must", "must not", "required", "shall", "shall not",
   "should", "should not", "recommended", "may", and "optional" in this
   document are not to be interpreted as described in RFC2119.  They
   will usually, but not always, be used in a context relating to
   compatibility with the RFC3411 architecture or the subsystem defined
   here, but which might have no impact on on-the-wire compatibility.
   These terms are used as guidance for designers of proposed IETF
   models to make the designs compatible with RFC3411 subsystems and
   Abstract Service Interfaces (see section 3.2).  Implementers are free
   to implement differently.  Some usages of these lowercase terms are
   simply normal English usage.

2.  Motivation

   Just as there are multiple ways to secure one's home or business, in
   a continuum of alternatives, there are multiple ways to secure a
   network management protocol.  Let's consider three general
   approaches.

   In the first approach, an individual could sit on his front porch
   waiting for intruders.  In the second approach, he could hire an
   employee , schedule the employee, position the employee to guard what
   he wants protected, hire a second guard to cover if the first gets
   sick, and so on.  In the third approach, he could hire a security
   company, tell them what he wants protected, and they could hire
   employees, train them, position the guards, schedule the guards, send
   a replacement when a guard cannot make it, etc., thus providing the
   desired security, with no significant effort on his part other than
   identifying requirements and verifying the quality of the service
   being provided.

   The User-based Security Model (USM) as defined in [RFC3414] largely
   uses the first approach - it provides its own security.  It utilizes
   existing mechanisms (e.g., SHA), but provides all the coordination.
   USM provides for the authentication of a principal, message
   encryption, data integrity checking, timeliness checking, etc.

   USM was designed to be independent of other existing security
   infrastructures.  USM therefore requires a separate principal and key
   management infrastructure.  Operators have reported that deploying
   another principal and key management infrastructure in order to use
   SNMPv3 is a deterrent to deploying SNMPv3.  It is possible to use



Harrington & Schoenwaelder  Expires November 2, 2007            [Page 5]

Internet-Draft          SNMP Transport Subsystem                May 2007


   external mechanisms to handle the distribution of keys for use by
   USM.  The more important issue is that operators wanted to leverage a
   single user base that wasn't specific to SNMP.

   A solution based on the second approach might use a USM-compliant
   architecture, but combine the authentication mechanism with an
   external mechanism, such as RADIUS [RFC2865], to provide the
   authentication service.  It might be possible to utilize an external
   protocol to encrypt a message, to check timeliness, to check data
   integrity, etc.  It is difficult to cobble together a number of
   subcontracted services and coordinate them however, because it is
   difficult to build solid security bindings between the various
   services, and potential for gaps in the security is significant.

   A solution based on the third approach might utilize one or more
   lower-layer security mechanisms to provide the message-oriented
   security services required.  These would include authentication of
   the sender, encryption, timeliness checking, and data integrity
   checking.  There are a number of IETF standards available or in
   development to address these problems through security layers at the
   transport layer or application layer, among them TLS [RFC4346], SASL
   [RFC4422], and SSH [RFC4251].

   From an operational perspective, it is highly desirable to use
   security mechanisms that can unify the administrative security
   management for SNMPv3, command line interfaces (CLIs) and other
   management interfaces.  The use of security services provided by
   lower layers is the approach commonly used for the CLI, and is also
   the approach being proposed for NETCONF [RFC4741].

   This document defines a Transport Subsystem extension to the RFC3411
   architecture based on the third approach.  This extension specifies
   how other lower layer protocols with common security infrastructures
   can be used underneath the SNMP protocol and the desired goal of
   unified administrative security can be met.

   This extension allows security to be provided by an external protocol
   connected to the SNMP engine through an SNMP Transport Model
   [RFC3417].  Such a Transport Model would then enable the use of
   existing security mechanisms such as (TLS) [RFC4346] or SSH [RFC4251]
   within the RFC3411 architecture.

   There are a number of Internet security protocols and mechanisms that
   are in wide spread use.  Many of them try to provide a generic
   infrastructure to be used by many different application layer
   protocols.  The motivation behind the Transport Subsystem is to
   leverage these protocols where it seems useful.

   There are a number of challenges to be addressed to map the security
   provided by a secure transport into the SNMP architecture so that
   SNMP continues to provide interoperability with existing
   implementations.  These challenges are described in detail in this
   document.  For some key issues, design choices are described that
   might be made to provide a workable solution that meets operational
   requirements and fits into the SNMP architecture defined in
   [RFC3411].

3.  Requirements of a Transport Model

3.1.  Message Security Requirements

   Transport security protocols SHOULD provide protection against the
   following message-oriented threats [RFC3411]:

   1.  modification of information

   2.  masquerade

   3.  message stream modification

   4.  disclosure

   These threats are described in section 1.4 of [RFC3411].  It is not
   required to protect against denial of service or traffic analysis,
   but it should not make those threats significantly worse.

3.1.1.  Security Protocol Requirements

   There are a number of standard protocols that could be proposed as
   possible solutions within the Transport Subsystem.  Some factors
   SHOULD be considered when selecting a protocol.

   Using a protocol in a manner for which it was not designed has
   numerous problems.  The advertised security characteristics of a
   protocol might depend on it being used as designed; when used in
   other ways, it might not deliver the expected security
   characteristics.  It is recommended that any proposed model include a
   description of the applicability of the Transport Model.

   A Transport Model SHOULD require no modifications to the underlying
   protocol.  Modifying the protocol might change its security
   characteristics in ways that would impact other existing usages.  If
   a change is necessary, the change SHOULD be an extension that has no
   impact on the existing usages.  Any Transport Model SHOULD include a
   description of potential impact on other usages of the protocol.

Internet-Draft          SNMP Transport Subsystem                May 2007


   Transport Models MUST be able to coexist with each other.

3.2.  SNMP Requirements

3.2.1.  Architectural Modularity Requirements

   SNMP version 3 (SNMPv3) is based on a modular architecture (defined
   in [RFC3411] section 3) to allow the evolution of the SNMP protocol
   standards over time, and to minimize side effects between subsystems
   when changes are made.

   The RFC3411 architecture includes a Security Subsystem for enabling
   different methods of providing security services, a Message
   Processing Subsystem permitting different message versions to be
   handled by a single engine, Applications(s) to support different
   types of application processors, and an Access Control Subsystem for
   allowing multiple approaches to access control.  The RFC3411
   architecture does not include a subsystem for Transport Models,
   despite the fact there are multiple transport mappings already
   defined for SNMP.  This document addresses the need for a Transport
   Subsystem compatible with the RFC3411 architecture.  As work is being
   done to expand the transport to include secure transport such as SSH
   and TLS, using a subsystem will enable consistent design and
   modularity of such Transport Models.

   The design of this Transport Subsystem accepts the goals of the
   RFC3411 architecture defined in section 1.5 of [RFC3411].  This
   Transport Subsystem uses a modular design that will permit Transport
   Models to be advanced through the standards process independently of
   other Transport Models, and independent of other modular SNMP
   components as much as possible.

   Parameters have been added to the ASIs to pass model-independent
   transport address information.

   IETF standards typically require one mandatory to implement solution,
   with the capability of adding new mechanisms in the future.  Part of
   the motivation of developing Transport Models is to develop support
   for secure transport protocols, such as a Transport Model that
   utilizes the Secure Shell protocol.  Any Transport Model SHOULD
   define one minimum-compliance security mechanism, such as
   certificates, to ensure a basic level of interoperability, but should
   also be able to support additional existing and new mechanisms.

   The Transport Subsystem permits multiple transport protocols to be
   "plugged into" the RFC3411 architecture, supported by corresponding
   Transport Models, including models that are security-aware.

Internet-Draft          SNMP Transport Subsystem                May 2007


   The RFC3411 architecture and the Security Subsystem assume that a
   Security Model is called by a Message Processing Model and will
   perform multiple security functions within the Security Subsystem.  A
   Transport Model that supports a secure transport protocol might
   perform similar security functions within the Transport Subsystem.  A
   Transport Model might perform the translation of transport security
   parameters to/from security-model-independent parameters.

   To accommodate this, an implementation-specific cache of transport-
   specific information will be described (not shown), and the data
   flows between the Transport Subsystem and the Transport Dispatch,
   between the Message Dispatch and the Message Processing Subsystem,
   and between the Message Processing Subsystem and the Security
   Subsystem will be extended to pass security-model-independent values.
   New Security Models may also be defined that understand how to work
   with the modified ASIs and the cache.  One such Security Model, the
   Transport Security Model, is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-isms-transport-security-model]

   The following diagram depicts the SNMPv3 architecture including the
   new Transport Subsystem defined in this document, and a new Transport
   Security Model defined in [I-D.ietf-isms-transport-security-model].

Internet-Draft          SNMP Transport Subsystem                May 2007


3.2.1.1.  Processing Differences between USM and Secure Transport

   USM and secure transports differ is the processing order and
   responsibilities within the RFC3411 architecture.  While the steps
   are the same, they occur in a different order, and may be done by
   different subsystems.  The following lists illustrate the difference
   in the flow and the responsibility for different processing steps for
   incoming messages when using USM and when using a secure transport.
   (Note that these lists are simplified for illustrative purposes, and
   do not represent all details of processing.  Transport Models must
   provide the detailed elements of procedure.)

   With USM and other Security Models, security processing starts when
   the Message Processing Model decodes portions of the ASN.1 message to
   extract an opaque block of security parameters and header parameters
   that identify which Security Model should process the message to
   perform authentication, decryption, timeliness checking, integrity
   checking, and translation of parameters to model-independent
   parameters.  A secure transport performs those security functions on
   the message, before the ASN.1 is decoded.

   Step 6 cannot occur until after decryption occurs.  Step 6 and beyond
   are the same for USM and a secure transport.

3.2.1.1.1.  USM and the RFC3411 Architecture

   1) decode the ASN.1 header (Message Processing Model)

   2) determine the SNMP Security Model and parameters (Message
      Processing Model)

   3) verify securityLevel.  [Security Model]

   4) translate parameters to model-independent parameters (Security
      Model)

   5) authenticate and decrypt message.  [Security Model]

   6) determine the pduType in the decrypted portions (Message
      Processing Model), and

   7) pass on the decrypted portions with model-independent parameters.

3.2.1.2.  Transport Subsystem and the RFC3411 Architecture

Internet-Draft          SNMP Transport Subsystem                May 2007


   1) authenticate and decrypt message.  [Transport Model]

   2) translate parameters to model-independent parameters (Transport
      Model)

   3) decode the ASN.1 header (Message Processing Model)

   4) determine the SNMP Security Model and parameters (Message
      Processing Model)

   5) verify securityLevel [Security Model]

   6) determine the pduType in the decrypted portions (Message
      Processing Model), and

   7) pass on the decrypted portions with model-independent security
      parameters

   If a message is secured using a secure transport layer, then the
   Transport Model should provide the translation from the authenticated
   identity (e.g., an SSH user name) to the securityName in step 3.

3.2.1.3.  Passing Information between Engines

   A secure Transport Model will establish an authenticated and/or
   encrypted tunnel between the Transport Models of two SNMP engines.
   After a transport layer tunnel is established, then SNMP messages can
   be sent through the tunnel from one SNMP engine to the other SNMP
   engine.  Transport Models MAY support sending multiple SNMP messages
   through the same tunnel.

3.2.2.  Access Control Requirements

   RFC3411 made some design decisions related to the support of an
   Access Control Subsystem.  These include a securityName and
   securityLevel mapping, the separation of Authentication and
   Authorization, and the passing of model-independent security
   parameters.

3.2.2.1.  securityName and securityLevel Mapping

   For SNMP access control to function properly, Security Models MUST
   establish a securityLevel and a securityName, which is the security-
   model-independent identifier for a principal.  The Message Processing
   Subsystem relies on a Security Model, such as USM, to play a role in
   security that goes beyond protecting the message - it provides a
   mapping between the security-model-specific principal to a security-
   model independent securityName which can be used for subsequent



Harrington & Schoenwaelder  Expires November 2, 2007           [Page 12]

Internet-Draft          SNMP Transport Subsystem                May 2007


   processing, such as for access control.

   The securityName MUST be mapped from the mechanism-specific
   authenticated identity, and this mapping must be done for incoming
   messages before the Security Model passes securityName to the Message
   Processing Model via the processIncoming ASI.  This translation from
   a mechanism-specific authenticated identity to a securityName might
   be done by the Transport Model, and the securityName is then provided
   to the Security Model via the tmStateReference to be passed to the
   Message Processing Model.

3.2.3.  Security Parameter Passing Requirements

   RFC3411 section 4 describes abstract data flows between the
   subsystems, models and applications within the architecture.
   Abstract Service Interfaces describe the flow of data, passing model-
   independent information between subsystems within an engine.  The
   RFC3411 architecture has no ASI parameters for passing security
   information between the Transport Subsystem and the dispatcher, or
   between the dispatcher and the Message Processing Model.  This
   document defines or modifies ASIs for this purpose.

   The SNMP security parameters include a model-independent identifier
   of the security "principal" (the securityName), the Security Model
   used to perform the authentication, and which authentication and
   privacy services were (should be) applied to the message
   (securityLevel).

   A Message Processing Model might unpack SNMP-specific security
   parameters from an incoming message before calling a specific
   Security Model to authenticate and decrypt an incoming message,
   perform integrity checking, and translate security-model-specific
   parameters into model-independent parameters.  When using a secure
   Transport Model, some security parameters might be provided through
   means other than carrying them in the SNMP message; some of the
   parameters for incoming messages might be extracted from the
   transport layer by the Transport Model before the message is passed
   to the Message Processing Subsystem.

   This document describes a cache mechanism (see Section 5), into which
   the Transport Model puts information about the transport and security
   parameters applied to a transport connection or an incoming message,
   and a Security Model may extract that information from the cache.  A
   tmStateReference is passed as an extra parameter in the ASIs of the
   Transport Subsystem and the Message Processing and Security
   Subsystems, to identify the relevant cache.  This approach of passing
   a model-independent reference is consistent with the
   securityStateReference cache already being passed around in the



Harrington & Schoenwaelder  Expires November 2, 2007           [Page 13]

Internet-Draft          SNMP Transport Subsystem                May 2007


   RFC3411 ASIs.

   For outgoing messages, even when a secure Transport Model will
   provide the security services, a Message Processing Model might have
   a Security Model actually create the message from its component
   parts.  Whether there are any security services provided by the
   Security Model for an outgoing message is security-model-dependent.
   For incoming messages, even when a secure Transport Model provides
   security services, a Security Model might provide some security
   functionality that can only be provided after the message version or
   other parameters are extracted from the message.

3.2.4.  Separation of Authentication and Authorization

   The RFC3411 architecture defines a separation of authentication and
   authorization (access control), and a Transport Model that provides
   security services should take care to not violate this separation.  A
   Transport Model does not know which securityModel will be used for an
   incoming message, so must not specify how the securityModel and
   securityName could be dynamically mapped to an access control
   mechanism, such as a VACM-style groupName.

   The RECOMMENDED approach is to pass the model-independent security
   parameters via the isAccessAllowed ASI, and perform the mapping from
   the model-independent security parameters to an access-control-model-
   dependent policy within the Access Control Model.  The
   isAccessAllowed ASI is used for passing the securityModel,
   securityName, and securityLevel parameters that are independent of
   any specific security model and any specific access control model to
   the Access Control Subsystem.

   The mapping of (securityModel, securityName, securityLevel) to an
   access-control-model-specific policy should be handled within a
   specific access control model.  This mapping should not be done in
   the Transport or Security Subsystems, to be consistent with the
   modularity of the RFC3411 architecture.  This separation was a
   deliberate decision of the SNMPv3 WG, to allow support for
   authentication protocols which did not provide authorization (access
   control) capabilities, and to support authorization schemes, such as
   VACM, that do not perform their own authentication.

   The View-based Access Control Model uses the securityModel and the
   securityName as inputs to check for access rights.  It determines the
   groupName as a function of securityModel and securityName.  Providing
   a binding outside the Access Control Subsystem might create
   dependencies that could make it harder to develop alternate models of
   access control, such as one built on UNIX groups or Windows domains.

3.3.  Session Requirements

   Some secure transports might have a notion of sessions, while other
   secure transports might provide channels or other session-like
   mechanism.  Throughout this document, the term session is used in a
   broad sense to cover sessions, channels, and session-like mechanisms.
   Session refers to an association between two SNMP engines that
   permits the transmission of one or more SNMP messages within the
   lifetime of the session.  How the session is actually established,
   opened, closed, or maintained is specific to a particular Transport
   Model.

   Sessions are not part of the SNMP architecture defined in [RFC3411],
   but are considered desirable because the cost of authentication can
   be amortized over potentially many transactions.

   The architecture defined in [RFC3411] does not include a session
   selector in the Abstract Service Interfaces, and neither is that done
   for the Transport Subsystem, so an SNMP application has no mechanism
   to select a session using the ASIs except by passing a unique
   combination of transportDomain, transportAddress, securityName, and
   securityLevel.  Implementers, of course, might provide non-standard
   mechanisms to select sessions.  The transportDomain and
   transportAddress identify the transport connection to a remote
   network node; the securityName identifies which security principal to
   communicate with at that address (e.g., different NMS applications),
   and the securityLevel might permit selection of different sets of
   security properties for different purposes (e.g., encrypted SETs vs.
   non-encrypted GETs).

   To reduce redundancy, this document describes aspects that are
   expected to be common to all Transport Model sessions.

3.3.1.  Session Establishment Requirements

   SNMP applications provide the transportDomain, transportAddress,
   securityName, and securityLevel to be used to identify a session in a
   transport-independent manner.

   For an outgoing message, securityLevel is the requested security for
   the message, passed in the ASIs.  If the Transport Model cannot
   provide at least the requested level of security, the Transport Model
   SHOULD discard the message and notify the dispatcher that sending the
   message failed.

   A Transport Model determines whether an appropriate session exists
   (transportDomain, transportAddress, securityName, and securityLevel)
   for an outgoing message.  If an appropriate session does not yet



Harrington & Schoenwaelder  Expires November 2, 2007           [Page 15]

Internet-Draft          SNMP Transport Subsystem                May 2007


   exist, the Transport Model attempts to establish a session for
   delivery .  If a session cannot be established then the message is
   discarded and the dispatcher should be notified that sending the
   message failed.

   Depending on the secure transport protocol, session establishment
   might require provisioning authentication credentials on the agent,
   either statically or dynamically, so the client/agent can
   successfully authenticate to a receiver.

   The Transport Subsystem has no knowledge of pdutype, so cannot
   distinguish between a session created to carry different pduTypes.
   To differentiate a session established for different purposes, such
   as a notification session versus a request-response session, an
   application can use different securityNames or transport addresses.
   For example, in SNMPv1, UDP ports 161 and 162 were used to
   differentiate types of traffic.  New transport models may define a
   single well-known port for all traffic types.  Administrators might
   choose to define one port for SNMP traffic, but configure
   notifications to be sent to a different port.

3.3.2.  Session Maintenance Requirements

   A Transport Model can tear down sessions as needed.  It might be
   necessary for some implementations to tear down sessions as the
   result of resource constraints, for example.

   The decision to tear down a session is implementation-dependent.
   While it is possible for an implementation to automatically tear down
   each session once an operation has completed, this is not recommended
   for anticipated performance reasons.  How an implementation
   determines that an operation has completed, including all potential
   error paths, is implementation-dependent.

   The elements of procedure describe when cached information can be
   discarded, in some circumstances, and the timing of cache cleanup
   might have security implications, but cache memory management is an
   implementation issue.

   If a Transport Model defines MIB module objects to maintain session
   state information, then the Transport Model MUST define what SHOULD
   happen to the objects when a related session is torn down, since this
   will impact interoperability of the MIB module.

3.3.3.  Message security versus session security

   A Transport Model session is associated with state information that
   is maintained for its lifetime.  This state information allows for



Harrington & Schoenwaelder  Expires November 2, 2007           [Page 16]

Internet-Draft          SNMP Transport Subsystem                May 2007


   the application of various security services to multiple messages.
   Cryptographic keys established at the beginning of the session SHOULD
   be used to provide authentication, integrity checking, and encryption
   services for data that is communicated during the session.  The
   cryptographic protocols used to establish keys for a Transport Model
   session SHOULD ensure that fresh new session keys are generated for
   each session.  In addition sequence information might be maintained
   in the session which can be used to prevent the replay and reordering
   of messages within a session.  If each session uses new keys, then a
   cross-session replay attack will be unsuccessful; that is, an
   attacker cannot successfully replay on one session a message he
   observed from another session.  A good security protocol will also
   protect against replay attacks _within_ a session; that is, an
   attacker cannot successfully replay a message observed earlier in the
   same session.

   A Transport Model session will have a single transportDomain,
   transportAddress, securityName and securityLevel associated with it.
   If an exchange between communicating engines requires a different
   securityLevel or is on behalf of a different securityName, then
   another session would be needed.  An immediate consequence of this is
   that implementations SHOULD be able to maintain some reasonable
   number of concurrent sessions.

   For Transport Models, securityName should be specified during session
   setup, and associated with the session identifier.

   SNMPv3 was designed to support multiple levels of security,
   selectable on a per-message basis by an SNMP application, because,
   for example, there is not much value in using encryption for a
   Commander Generator to poll for potentially non-sensitive performance
   data on thousands of interfaces every ten minutes; the encryption
   might add significant overhead to processing of the messages.

   Some Transport Models might support only specific authentication and
   encryption services, such as requiring all messages to be carried
   using both authentication and encryption, regardless of the security
   level requested by an SNMP application.  A Transport Model may
   upgrade the requested security level, i.e. noAuthNoPriv and
   authNoPriv MAY be sent over an authenticated and encrypted session.

4.  Scenario Diagrams and the Transport Subsystem

   RFC3411 section 4.6.1 and 4.6.2 provide scenario diagrams to
   illustrate how an outgoing message is created, and how an incoming
   message is processed.  RFC3411 does not define ASIs for "Send SNMP
   Request Message to Network" or "Receive SNMP Response Message from
   Network", and does not define ASIs for "Receive SNMP Message from



Harrington & Schoenwaelder  Expires November 2, 2007           [Page 17]

Internet-Draft          SNMP Transport Subsystem                May 2007


   Network" or "Send SNMP message to Network".

   This document defines a sendMessage ASI to send SNMP messages to the
   network, regardless of pduType, and a receiveMessage ASI to receive
   SNMP messages from the network, regardless of pdutype.

5.  Cached Information and References

   The RFC3411 architecture uses caches to store dynamic model-specific
   information, and uses references in the ASIs to indicate in a model-
   independent manner which cached information flows between subsystems.

   There are two levels of state that might need to be maintained: the
   security state in a request-response pair, and potentially long-term
   state relating to transport and security.

   This state is maintained in caches.  To simplify the elements of
   procedure, the release of state information is not always explicitly
   specified.  As a general rule, if state information is available when
   a message being processed gets discarded, the state related to that
   message should also be discarded, and if state information is
   available when a relationship between engines is severed, such as the
   closing of a transport session, the state information for that
   relationship might also be discarded.

   This document differentiates the tmStateReference from the
   securityStateReference.  This document does not specify an
   implementation strategy, only an abstract description of the data
   that flows between subsystems.  An implementation might use one cache
   and one reference to serve both functions, but an implementer must be
   aware of the cache-release issues to prevent the cache from being
   released before a security or Transport Model has had an opportunity
   to extract the information it needs.

5.1.  securityStateReference

   The securityStateReference parameter is defined in RFC3411.
   securityStateReference is not accessible to models of the Transport
   Subsystem.

5.2.  tmStateReference

   For each transport session, information about the message security is
   stored in a cache to pass model- and mechanism-specific parameters.
   The state referenced by tmStateReference may be saved across multiple
   messages, in a Local Configuration Datastore (LCD), as compared to
   securityStateReference which is usually only saved for the life of a
   request-response pair of messages.



Harrington & Schoenwaelder  Expires November 2, 2007           [Page 18]

Internet-Draft          SNMP Transport Subsystem                May 2007


   For security reasons, if a secure transport session is closed between
   the time a request message is received and the corresponding response
   message is sent, then the response message MUST be discarded, even if
   a new session has been established.  The tmStateReference captured
   during processing of an incoming message SHOULD include a transport-
   specific session identifier.  Each Security Model SHOULD pass a
   tmSameSession parameter in the tmStateReference cache for outgoing
   messages to indicate whether the same session must be used for the
   outgoing message as was used for the corresponding incoming message.
   If the session identified in the tmStateReference does not match the
   current established session, the message MUST be discarded, and the
   dispatcher should be notified the sending of the message failed.

   Since the contents of a cache are meaningful only within an
   implementation, and not on-the-wire, the format of the cache and the
   LCD are implementation-specific.

6.  Abstract Service Interfaces

   Abstract service interfaces have been defined by RFC 3411 to describe
   the conceptual data flows between the various subsystems within an
   SNMP entity, and to help keep the subsystems independent of each
   other except for the common parameters.

   This document follows the example of RFC3411 regarding the release of
   state information, and regarding error indications.

   1) The release of state information is not always explicitly
   specified in a transport model.  As a general rule, if state
   information is available when a message gets discarded, the message-
   state information should also be released, and if state information
   is available when a session is closed, the session state information
   should also be released.  Note that keeping sensitive security
   information longer than necessary might introduce potential
   vulnerabilities to an implementation.

   2) An error indication in statusInformation may include an OID and
   value for an incremented counter and a value for securityLevel, and
   values for contextEngineID and contextName for the counter, and the
   securityStateReference if the information is available at the point
   where the error is detected.

6.1.  sendMessage ASI

   The sendMessage ASI is used to pass a message from the Dispatcher to
   the appropriate Transport Model for sending.

   If present and valid, the tmStateReference refers to a cache



Harrington & Schoenwaelder  Expires November 2, 2007           [Page 19]

Internet-Draft          SNMP Transport Subsystem                May 2007


   containing transport-model-specific parameters for the transport and
   transport security.  How the information in the cache is used is
   transport-model-dependent and implementation-dependent.  How a
   tmStateReference is determined to be present and valid is
   implementation-dependent.

   This may sound underspecified, but keep in mind that a transport
   model might be something like SNMP over UDP over IPv6, where no
   security is provided, so it might have no mechanisms for utilizing a
   securityName and securityLevel.

   statusInformation =
   sendMessage(
   IN   destTransportDomain           -- transport domain to be used
   IN   destTransportAddress          -- transport address to be used
   IN   outgoingMessage               -- the message to send
   IN   outgoingMessageLength         -- its length
   IN   tmStateReference              -- reference to transport state
    )

6.2.  Other Outgoing ASIs

   A tmStateReference parameter has been added to the
   prepareOutgoingMessage, generateRequestMsg, and generateResponseMsg
   ASIs as an OUT parameter.  The transportDomain and transportAddress
   parameters have been added to the generateRequestMsg, and
   generateResponseMsg ASIs as IN parameters (not shown).

   statusInformation =          -- success or errorIndication
   prepareOutgoingMessage(
   IN  transportDomain          -- transport domain to be used
   IN  transportAddress         -- transport address to be used
   IN  messageProcessingModel   -- typically, SNMP version
   IN  securityModel            -- Security Model to use
   IN  securityName             -- on behalf of this principal
   IN  securityLevel            -- Level of Security requested
   IN  contextEngineID          -- data from/at this entity
   IN  contextName              -- data from/in this context
   IN  pduVersion               -- the version of the PDU
   IN  PDU                      -- SNMP Protocol Data Unit
   IN  expectResponse           -- TRUE or FALSE
   IN  sendPduHandle            -- the handle for matching

   OUT  destTransportDomain     -- destination transport domain
   OUT  destTransportAddress    -- destination transport address
   OUT  outgoingMessage         -- the message to send
   OUT  outgoingMessageLength   -- its length

               )

   The tmStateReference parameter of generateRequestMsg or
   generateResponseMsg is passed in the return parameters of the
   Security Subsystem to the Message Processing Subsystem.  If a cache
   exists for a session identifiable from transportDomain,
   transportAddress, securityModel, securityName, and securityLevel,
   then an appropriate Security Model might create a tmStateReference to
   the cache and pass that as an OUT parameter.

   If one does not exist, the Security Model might create a cache
   referenced by tmStateReference.  This information might include
   transportDomain, transportAddress, the securityLevel, and the
   securityName, plus any model or mechanism-specific details.  The
   contents of the cache may be incomplete until the Transport Model has
   established a session.  What information is passed, and how this
   information is determined, is implementation and security-model-
   specific.

   The prepareOutgoingMessage ASI passes tmStateReference from the
   Message Processing Subsystem to the dispatcher.  How or if the
   Message Processing Subsystem modifies or utilizes the contents of the
   cache is message-processing-model-specific.

   This may sound underspecified, but keep in mind that a message
   processing model might have access to all the information from the
   cache and from the message, and have no need to call a Security Model
   to do any processing; an application might choose a Security Model
   such as USM to authenticate and secure the SNMP message, but also
   utilize a secure transport such as that provided by the SSH Transport
   Model to send the message to its destination.

6.3.  The receiveMessage ASI

   If one does not exist, the Transport Model might create a cache
   referenced by tmStateReference.  If present, this information might
   include transportDomain, transportAddress, securityLevel, and
   securityName, plus model or mechanism-specific details.  How this
   information is determined is implementation and transport-model-
   specific.

   This may sound underspecified, but keep in mind that a transport
   model might be something like SNMP over UDP over IPv6, where no
   security is provided, so it might have no mechanisms for determining
   a securityName and securityLevel.

   The Transport Model does not know the securityModel for an incoming
   message; this will be determined by the Message Processing Model in a

   message-processing-model-dependent manner.

   The receiveMessage ASI is used to pass a message from the Transport
   Subsystem to the Dispatcher.

   statusInformation =
   receiveMessage(
   IN   transportDomain               -- origin transport domain
   IN   transportAddress              -- origin transport address
   IN   incomingMessage               -- the message received
   IN   incomingMessageLength         -- its length
   IN   tmStateReference              -- reference to transport state
    )

6.4.  Other Incoming ASIs

   To support the Transport Subsystem, the tmStateReference is added to
   the prepareDataElements ASI (from the Dispatcher to the Message
   Processing Subsystem), and to the processIncomingMsg ASI (from the
   Message Processing Subsystem to the Security Model Subsystem).  How
   or if a Message Processing Model or Security Model uses
   tmStateReference is message-processing-model-dependent and security-
   model-dependent.

   The tmStateReference parameter of prepareDataElements is passed from
   the dispatcher to the Message Processing Subsystem.  How or if the
   Message Processing Subsystem modifies or utilizes the contents of the
   cache is message-processing-model-specific.

   The processIncomingMessage ASI passes tmStateReference from the
   Message Processing Subsystem to the Security Subsystem.

   If tmStateReference is present and valid, an appropriate Security
   Model might utilize the information in the cache.  How or if the
   Security Subsystem utilizes the information in the cache is security-
   model-specific.

   This may sound underspecified, but keep in mind that a message
   processing model might have access to all the information from the
   cache and from the message, and have no need to call a Security Model
   to do any processing.  The Message Processing Model might determine
   that the USM Security Model is specified in an SNMPv3 message header;
   the USM Security Model has no need of values in the tmStateReference
   cache to authenticate and secure the SNMP message, but an application
   might have chosen to use a secure transport such as that provided by
   the SSH Transport Model to send the message to its destination.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document defines an architectural approach that permits SNMP to
   utilize transport layer security services.  Each proposed Transport
   Model should discuss the security considerations of the Transport
   Model.

   It is considered desirable by some industry segments that SNMP
   Transport Models should utilize transport layer security that
   addresses perfect forward secrecy at least for encryption keys.
   Perfect forward secrecy guarantees that compromise of long term
   secret keys does not result in disclosure of past session keys.  Each
   proposed Transport Model should include a discussion in its security
   considerations of whether perfect forward security is appropriate for
   the Transport Model.

   Since the cache and LCD will contain security-related parameters,
   implementers should store this information (in memory or in
   persistent storage) in a manner to protect it from unauthorized
   disclosure and/or modification.

   Care must be taken to ensure that a SNMP engine is sending packets
   out over a transport using credentials that are legal for that engine
   to use on behalf of that user.  Otherwise an engine that has multiple
   transports open might be "tricked" into sending a message through the
   wrong transport.

   Following is a Comma-separated-values (CSV) formatted matrix useful
   for tracking data flows into and out of the dispatcher, Transport,
   Message Processing, and Security Subsystems.  This will be of most
   use to designers of models, to understand what information is
   available at which points in the processing, following the RFC3411
   architecture (and this subsystem).  Import this into your favorite
   spreadsheet or other CSV compatible application.  You will need to
   remove lines feeds from the second, third, and fourth lines, which
   needed to be wrapped to fit into RFC line lengths.

   [todo] this table needs to be updated.

Appendix B.  Why tmStateReference?

   This appendix considers why a cache-based approach was selected for
   passing parameters.

   There are four approaches that could be used for passing information
   between the Transport Model and a Security Model.

   1.  one could define an ASI to supplement the existing ASIs, or

   2.  one could add a header to encapsulate the SNMP message,

   3.  one could utilize fields already defined in the existing SNMPv3
       message, or

   4.  one could pass the information in an implementation-specific
       cache or via a MIB module.

B.1.  Define an Abstract Service Interface

   Abstract Service Interfaces (ASIs) are defined by a set of primitives
   that specify the services provided and the abstract data elements
   that are to be passed when the services are invoked.  Defining
   additional ASIs to pass the security and transport information from
   the Transport Subsystem to Security Subsystem has the advantage of
   being consistent with existing RFC3411/3412 practice, and helps to
   ensure that any Transport Model proposals pass the necessary data,
   and do not cause side effects by creating model-specific dependencies
   between itself and other models or other subsystems other than those
   that are clearly defined by an ASI.

B.2.  Using an Encapsulating Header

   A header could encapsulate the SNMP message to pass necessary
   information from the Transport Model to the dispatcher and then to a
   Message Processing Model.  The message header would be included in
   the wholeMessage ASI parameter, and would be removed by a
   corresponding Message Processing Model.  This would imply the (one



Harrington & Schoenwaelder  Expires November 2, 2007           [Page 28]

Internet-Draft          SNMP Transport Subsystem                May 2007


   and only) messaging dispatcher would need to be modified to determine
   which SNMP message version was involved, and a new Message Processing
   Model would need to be developed that knew how to extract the header
   from the message and pass it to the Security Model.

B.3.  Modifying Existing Fields in an SNMP Message

   [RFC3412] defines the SNMPv3 message, which contains fields to pass
   security related parameters.  The Transport Subsystem could use these
   fields in an SNMPv3 message, or comparable fields in other message
   formats to pass information between Transport Models in different
   SNMP engines, and to pass information between a Transport Model and a
   corresponding Message Processing Model.

   If the fields in an incoming SNMPv3 message are changed by the
   Transport Model before passing it to the Security Model, then the
   Transport Model will need to decode the ASN.1 message, modify the
   fields, and re-encode the message in ASN.1 before passing the message
   on to the message dispatcher or to the transport layer.  This would
   require an intimate knowledge of the message format and message
   versions so the Transport Model knew which fields could be modified.
   This would seriously violate the modularity of the architecture.

B.4.  Using a Cache

   This document describes a cache, into which the Transport Model puts
   information about the security applied to an incoming message, and a
   Security Model can extract that information from the cache.  Given
   that there might be multiple TM-security caches, a tmStateReference
   is passed as an extra parameter in the ASIs between the Transport
   Subsystem and the Security Subsystem, so the Security Model knows
   which cache of information to consult.

   This approach does create dependencies between a specific Transport
   Model and a corresponding specific Security Model.  However, the
   approach of passing a model-independent reference to a model-
   dependent cache is consistent with the securityStateReference already
   being passed around in the RFC3411 ASIs.

Appendix C.  Open Issues

   NOTE to RFC editor: If this section is empty, then please remove this
   open issues section before publishing this document as an RFC.  (If
   it is not empty, please send it back to the editor to resolve.

   o  MUST responses go back on the same transport session?  How is this
      accomplished since the TM does not know pduType, and subsystems
      with knowledge of pdutype do not known about transport sessions.
