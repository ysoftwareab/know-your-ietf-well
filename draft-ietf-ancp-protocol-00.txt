     Abstract 

        This document describes proposed extensions to the GSMPv3 protocol to 
        allow its use in a broadband environment, as a control plane between   
        Access Nodes (e.g. DSLAM) and Broadband Network Gateways (e.g. NAS). 
        These proposed extensions are required to realize a protocol for 
        “Access Node Control” mechanism as described in [9]. The resulting 
        protocol with the proposed extensions to GSMPv3 [4] is referred to as 
        “Access Node Control Protocol” (ANCP).  This document focuses on 
        specific use cases of access node control mechanism for topology 
        discovery, line configuration, and OAM. It is intended to be 
        augmented by additional protocol specification for future use cases 
        considered in scope by the ANCP charter.

     2  Introduction 

        DSL is a widely deployed access technology for Broadband Access for 
        Next Generation Networks. Several specifications like [1-3] describe 
        possible architectures for these access networks. In the scope of 
        these specifications are the delivery of voice, video and data 
        services. 

        When deploying value-added services across DSL access networks, 
        special attention regarding quality of service and service control is 
        required, which implies a tighter coordination between network 
        elements in the broadband access network without burdening the OSS 
        layer.  

        This draft defines extensions and modifications to GSMPv3 (specified 
        in [4]) and certain new mechanisms to realize a control plane between 
        a service-oriented layer 3 edge device (the NAS) and a layer2 Access 
        Node (e.g. DSLAM) in order to perform QoS-related, service-related 
        and subscriber-related operations. The control protocol as a result 
        of these extensions and mechanisms is referred to as “Access Node 
        Control Protocol” (ANCP).  

        In addition to specifying extensions and modifications to relevant 
        GSMP messages applicable to access node control mechanism, this draft 
        also defines values that ANCP should set for relevant fields in these 
        GSMP messages. However, to understand the basic semantics of various 
        fields in GSMP messages, the reader is referred to [4]. 

         
     3  Broadband Access Aggregation  

         
     3.1 ATM-based broadband aggregation  

        End to end DSL network consists of network and application service 
        provider networks (NSP and ASP networks), regional/access network, 
        and customer premises network. Fig1. shows ATM broadband access 
        network components.

        The Regional/Access Network consists of the Regional Network, Network 
        Access Server, and the Access Network as show in Fig 1. Its primary 
        function is to provide end-to-end transport between the customer 
        premises and the NSP or ASP. The Access Node terminates the DSL 
        signal. It could consist of DSLAM in the central office, or remote 
        DSLAM, or a Remote Access Multiplexer (RAM). Access node is the first 
        point in the network where traffic on multiple DSL lines will be 
        aggregated onto a single network.  

        The NAS performs multiple functions in the network. The NAS is the 
        aggregation point for the subscriber traffic. It provides aggregation 
        capabilities (e.g. IP, PPP, ATM) between the Regional/Access Network 
        and the NSP or ASP. These include traditional ATM-based offerings and 
        newer, more native IP-based services. This includes support for 
        Point-to-Point Protocol over ATM (PPPoA) and PPP over Ethernet 
        (PPPoE), as well as direct IP services encapsulated over an 
        appropriate layer 2 transport.  

        Beyond aggregation, NAS is also the injection point for policy 
        management and IP QoS in the Regional/Access Networks. In order to 
        allow IP QoS support over an existing non-IP-aware layer 2 access 
        network without using multiple layer 2 QoS classes, a mechanism based 
        on hierarchical scheduling is used. This mechanism defined in [1], 
        preserves IP QoS over the ATM network between the NAS and the RGs by    
        carefully controlling downstream traffic in the NAS, so that   
        significant queuing and congestion does not occur further down the

        ATM network. This is achieved by using a diffserv-aware hierarchical 
        scheduler in the NAS that will account for downstream trunk 
        bandwidths and DSL synch rates. 
        [9] provides detailed definition and functions of each network 
        element in the broadband reference architecture.

     3.2 Ethernet-based broadband aggregation  

     The Ethernet aggregation network architecture builds on the Ethernet 
     bridging/switching concepts defined in IEEE 802. The Ethernet 
     aggregation network provides traffic aggregation, class of service 
     distinction, and customer separation and traceability. VLAN tagging 
     defined in IEEE 802.1Q and being enhanced by IEEE 802.1ad is used as 
     standard virtualization mechanism in the Ethernet aggregation network. 
     The aggregation devices are “provider edge bridges” defined in IEEE 
     802.ad.  
     Stacked VLAN tags provide one possible way to create equivalent of 
     “virtual paths” and “virtual circuits” in the aggregation network. The 
     “outer” vlan could be used to create a form of “virtual path” between a 
     given DSLAM and a given NAS. And “inner” VLAN tags to create a form of 
     “virtual circuit” on a per DSL line basis. This is 1:1 VLAN allocation 
     model. An alternative model is to bridge sessions from multiple 
     subscribers behind a DSLAM into a single VLAN in the aggregation

     network. This is N:1 VLAN allocation model. Architectural and 
     topological models of an Ethernet aggregation network in context of DSL 
     aggregation are defined in [8].  
         

     4  Access Node Control Protocol 

     4.1 Overview 

        A dedicated control protocol between NAS and access nodes can 
        facilitate "NAS managed" tight QOS control in the access network, 
        simplified OSS infrastructure for service management, optimized 
        multicast replication to enable video services over DSL, subscriber 
        statistics retrieval on the NAS for accounting purposes, and fault 
        isolation capability on the NAS for the underlying access technology. 
        This dedicated control plane is referred to as “Access Node Control 
        Protocol” (ANCP). This document specifies relevant extensions to 
        GSMPv3 as defined [4] to realize ANCP. 

        Following sections discuss the use of ANCP for implementing: 

          . Dynamic discovery of access topology by the NAS to provide tight 
             QOS control in the access network. 

          . Pushing to the access-nodes, subscriber and service data 
             retrieved by the NAS from an OSS system (e.g. radius server), to 
             simplify OSS infrastructure for service management. 

          . Optimized, "NAS controlled and managed" multicast replication by 
             access-nodes at L2 layer.  

          . NAS controlled, on-demand access-line test capability 
             (rudimentary end-to-end OAM).    

        In addition to DSL, alternate broadband access technologies (e.g. 
        Metro-Ethernet, Passive Optical Networking, WiMax) will have similar 
        challenges to address, and could benefit from the same approach of a 
        control plane between a NAS and an Access Node (e.g. OLT), providing 
        a unified control and management architecture for multiple access 
        technologies, hence facilitating migration from one to the other 
        and/or parallel deployments.  

        GSMPv3 is an ideal fit for implementing ANCP. It is extensible and 
        can be run over TCP/IP, which makes it possible to run over different 
        access technologies.

     4.2 ANCP based Access Topology Discovery 

     4.2.1 Goals 

        [1] discusses various queuing/scheduling mechanisms to avoid 
        congestion in the access network while dealing with multiple flows 
        with distinct QoS requirements. Such mechanisms require that the NAS 
        gains knowledge about the topology of the access network, the various 
        links being used and their respective rates. Some of the information 
        required is somewhat dynamic in nature (e.g. DSL sync rate), hence 
        cannot come from a provisioning and/or inventory management OSS 
        system. Some of the information varies less frequently (e.g. capacity 
        of a DSLAM uplink), but nevertheless needs to be kept strictly in 
        sync between the actual capacity of the uplink and the image the NAS 
        has of it.  

        Following section describes ANCP messages that allow the Access Node 
        (e.g. DSLAM) to communicate to the NAS, access network topology 
        information and any corresponding updates.  

        Some of the parameters that can be communicated from the DSLAM to the 
        NAS include DSL line state, actual upstream and downstream data rates 
        of a synchronized DSL link, maximum attainable upstream and 
        downstream data rates, interleaving delay etc. Topology discovery is 
        specifically important in case the net data rate of the DSL line 
        changes over time. The DSL net data rate may be different every time 
        the DSL modem is turned on. Additionally, during the time the DSL 
        modem is active, data rate changes can occur due to environmental 
        conditions (the DSL line can get "out of sync" and can retrain to a 
        lower value.  

     4.2.2 Message Flow  

     When a DSL line initially comes up or resynchronizes to a different 
     rate, the DSLAM generates and transmits a GSMP PORT UP EVENT message to     
     the NAS. The extension field in the message carries the TLVs containing 
     DSL line specific parameters. On a loss of signal on the DSL line, a    
     GSMP PORT DOWN message is generated by the DSLAM to the NAS. In order to 
     provide expected service level, NAS needs to learn the initial     
     attributes of the DSL line before the subscriber can log in and access 
     the provisioned services for the subscriber.

        The Event message with PORT UP message type (80) is used for 
        conveying DSL line attributes to the NAS. This message with relevant 
        extensions is defined in section 5.4.2.    

             

     4.3 ANCP based Line Configuration 

     4.3.1 Goals 

        Following dynamic discovery of access topology (identification of DSL 
        line and its attributes) as assisted by the mechanism described    in 
        the previous section (topology discovery), the NAS could then query a 
        subscriber management OSS system (e.g. RADIUS server) to     retrieve 
        subscriber authorization data (service profiles, aka user 
        entitlement). Most of such service mechanisms are typically enforced     
        by the NAS itself, but there are a few cases where it might be useful 
        to push such service parameter to the DSLAM for local enforcement of 
        a mechanism (e.g. DSL-related) on the corresponding subscriber line. 
        One such example of a service parameter that can be pushed to the 
        DSLAM for local enforcement is DSL "interleaving delay". Longer 
        interleaving delay (and hence stringent error correction) is required 
      
      
     Wadhwa et.al           Expires August 25, 2007                 [Page 9]

        for a video service to ensure better video "quality of experience", 
        whereas for a VoIP service or for "shoot first" gaming service, a 
        very short interleaving delay is more appropriate. Another relevant 
        application is downloading per subscriber multicast channel 
        entitlement information in IPTV applications where the DSLAM is 
        performing IGMP snooping or IGMP proxy function. Using ANCP, the NAS 
        could achieve the goal of pushing line configuration to the DSLAM by 
        an interoperable and standardized protocol.  

        If a subscriber wants to choose a different service, it can require 
        an OPEX intensive reconfiguration of the line via a network operator, 
        possibly implying a business-to-business transaction between an ISP 
        and an access provider. Using ANCP for line configuration from the 
        NAS dramatically simplifies the OSS infrastructure for service 
        management, allowing fully centralized subscriber-related service 
        data (e.g. RADIUS server back-end) and avoiding complex cross-
        organization B2B interactions.  

        The best way to change line parameters would be by using profiles. 
        These profiles (DSL profiles for different services) are pre-
        configured on the DSLAMs. The NAS can then indicate a reference to 
        the right DSL profile via ANCP. Alternatively, discrete DSL 
        parameters can also be conveyed by the NAS in ANCP. 

         

     4.3.2 Message Flow  

     Triggered by topology information reporting a new DSL line or triggered 
     by a subsequent user session establishment (PPP or DHCP), the NAS may 
     send line configuration information (e.g. reference to a DSL profile) to 
     the DSLAM using GSMP Port Management messages. The NAS may get such line 
     configuration data from a policy server (e.g. RADIUS). Figure 3 
     summarizes the interaction.

        The format of relevant extensions to port management message is 
        defined in section 5.4.3. The line configuration models could be 
        viewed as a form of delegation of authorization from the NAS to the 
        DSLAM. 

   

     4.4 ANCP based Transactional Multicast 

        Typical IP multicast in access networks involves the NAS terminating 
        user requests for receiving multicast channels via IGMP. The NAS 
        authorizes the subscriber, and dynamically determines the multicast 
        subscription rights for the subscriber. Based on the user's 
        subscription, the NAS can replicate the same multicast stream to 
        multiple subscribers. This leads to a waste of access bandwidth if 
        multiple subscribers access network services via the same access-node 
        (e.g. DSLAM). The amount of multicast replication is of the order of 
        number of subscribers rather than the number of access-nodes. 

        It is ideal for NAS to send a single copy of the multicast stream to 
        a given access-node, and let the access-node perform multicast 
        replication   by layer2 means (e.g. ATM point-to-multipoint cell 
        replication or ethernet data-link bridging) for subscribers behind 
        the access-node. However, operationally, NAS is the ideal choice to 
        handle subscriber management functions (authentication, 
        authorization, accounting and address management), multicast policies 
      
      
     Wadhwa et.al           Expires August 25, 2007                [Page 12] 
         
     Internet-Draft       draft-ietf-ancp-protocol-00        August 2007 
         

        such as per-channel authorization, and complex multicast routing 
        protocols. Therefore, some means is needed for the NAS to setup 
        multicast replication state in the access-nodes. In ATM access 
        networks, ANCP can be used by the NAS to setup P2MP cross-connects in 
        the DSLAMs. Protocol support for this use-case will be provided in 
        future. 

      

     4.5 ANCP based OAM 

        In a mixed Ethernet and ATM access network (including the local 
        loop), it is desirable to provide similar mechanisms for connectivity 
        checks and fault isolation, as those used in an ATM based 
        architecture. This can be achieved using an ANCP based mechanism 
        until end-to-end Ethernet OAM mechanisms are more widely implemented 
        in various network elements. 

        A simple solution based on ANCP can provide NAS with an access-line 
        test capability and to some extent fault isolation. Controlled by a 
        local management interface the NAS can use an ANCP operation to 
        trigger the access-node to perform a loopback test on the local-loop 
        (between the access-node and the CPE). The access-node can respond 
        via another ANCP operation the result of the triggered loopback test. 
        In case of ATM based local-loop the ANCP operation can trigger the 
        access-node to generate ATM (F4/F5) loopback cells on the local loop. 
        In case of Ethernet, the access-node can trigger an ethernet loopback 
        message(per EFM OAM) on the local-loop. 

     4.5.1 Message Flow  

        “Port Management” message can be used by the NAS to request access 
        node to trigger a “remote loopback” test on the local loop. The 
        result of the loopback test can be asynchronously conveyed by the 
        access node to the NAS in a “Port Management” response message. The 
        format of relevant extensions to port management message is defined 
        in section 5.4.4.

     5  Access Node Control Protocol (ANCP) 

     5.1 ANCP/TCP connection establishment 

        ANCP will use TCP for exchanging protocol messages. [5] defines the 
        GSMP message encapsulation for TCP. The TCP   session is initiated 
        from the DSLAM (access node) to the NAS (controller). This is 
        necessary to avoid static provisioning on the NAS for all the DSLAMs 
        that are being served by the NAS. It is easier to configure a given 
        DSLAM with the single IP address of the NAS that serves the DSLAM. 
        This is a deviation from [5] which indicates that the controller 
        initiates the TCP connection to the switch. 

        NAS listens for incoming connections from the access nodes. Port 6068 
        is used for TCP connection. Adjacency protocol messages, which are 
        used to synchronize the NAS and access-nodes and maintain handshakes, 
        are sent after the TCP connection is established. ANCP messages other 
        than adjacency protocol messages may be sent only after the adjacency 
        protocol has achieved synchronization. 

        In the case of ATM access, a separate PVC (control channel) capable 
        of transporting IP would be configured between NAS and the DSLAM for     
        ANCP messages.

     5.2 ANCP Connection keep-alive 

        GSMPv3 defines an adjacency protocol.  The adjacency protocol is used 
        to synchronize states across the link, to negotiate which version of 
        the GSMP protocol to use, to discover the identity of the entity at 
        the other end of a link, and to detect when it changes. GSMP is a 
        hard     state protocol.  It is therefore important to detect loss of 
        contact between switch and controller, and to detect any change of 
        identity    of switch or controller. No protocol messages other than 
        those of the adjacency protocol may be sent across the link until the 
        adjacency protocol has achieved synchronization. There are no changes 
        to the base GSMP adjacency protocol for implementing ANCP. 

        The NAS will set the M-flag in the SYN message (signifying it is the 
        master). Once the adjacency is established, periodic adjacency 
        messages     (type ACK) are exchanged. The default ACK interval as 
        advertised in the adjacency messages is 10 sec for ANCP. It SHOULD be 
        configurable and is an implementation choice. It is recommended that 
        both ends specify the same timer value. However, it is not necessary 
        for the timer values to match. 

        The GSMP adjacency message defined in [4] is extended for ANCP and is 
        shown in section 5.3 immediately following this section. The 8-bit 
        “version” field in the adjacency protocol messages is modified to 
        carry the version and sub-version of the GSMP protocol for version 
        negotiation. ANCP uses version 3 and sub-version 1 of GSMP protocol. 
        The semantics and suggested values for Code, “Sender Name”, “Receiver 
        Name”, “Sender Instance”, and “Receiver Instance” fields are as 
        defined in [4]. The “Sender Port”, and “Receiver Port” should be set 
        to 0 by both ends. The pType field should be set to 0. The pFlag 
        should be set to 1. 

        If the adjacency times out on either end, due to not receiving an 
        adjacency message for a duration of (3 * Timer value), where the 
        timer value is specified in the adjacency message, all the state 
        received from the ANCP neighbor should be cleaned up, and the TCP 
        connection should be closed. The NAS would continue to listen for new 
        connection requests. The DSLAM will try to re-establish the TCP 
        connection and both sides will attempt to re-establish the adjacency. 

        The handling defined above will need some modifications when ANCP 
        graceful restart procedures are defined. These procedures will be 
        defined in a separate draft.

     5.3 Capability negotiation 

        The adjacency message as defined in [4] is extended to carry 
        technology specific "Capability TLVs". Both the NAS and the access 
        node will advertise supported capabilities in the originated 
        adjacency messages. If a received adjacency message indicates absence 
        of support for a capability that is supported by the receiving 
        device, it will turn off the capability locally and will send an 
        updated adjacency message with the capability turned off to match the 
        received capability set. This process will eventually result in both 
        sides agreeing on the minimal set of supported capabilities. The 
        adjacency will not come up unless the capabilities advertised by the 
        controller and the controlled device match. 

        After initial synchronization, if at anytime a capability mismatch is 
        detected, the adjacency will be brought down (RSTACK will be 
        generated by the device detecting the mismatch), and synchronization 
        will be re-attempted.

         The format of capability TLV is:

        The Tech Type field type indicates the technology to which the 
        capability extension applies. For access node control in case of DSL 
        networks, new type "DSL" is proposed. The value for this field is 
        0x05. This is the first available value in the range that is not 
        currently allocated. It will need to be reserved with IANA. 

        Capability length is the number of actual bytes contained in the 
        value portion of the TLV. The TLV is padded to a 4-octet alignment. 
        Therefore, a TLV with no data will contain a zero in the length field 
        (if capability data is three octets, the length field will contain a 
        three, but the size of the actual TLV is eight octets). 

        Capability data field can be empty if the capability is just a 
        boolean. In case the capability is a boolean, it is inferred from the 
        presence of the TLV (with no data). Capability data provides the 
        flexibility to advertise more than mere presence or absence of a 
        capability. Capability types can be registered with IANA. Following 
        capabilities are defined for ANCP as applied to DSL access: 

          1. Capability Type : Dynamic-Topology-Discovery = 0x01 

             Length (in bytes) : 0 

             Capability Data : NULL 

         

          2. Capability Type : Line-Configuration = 0x02 

             Length (in bytes) : 0 

             Capability Data : NULL

          3. Capability Type : Transactional-Multicast = 0x03 (controller 
             i.e. NAS terminates IGMP messages from subscribers, and via l2 
             control protocol, signals state to the access-nodes (e.g. 
             DSLAMs) to enable layer2 replication of multicast streams. In 
             ATM access network this implies that NAS instructs the access-
             node to setup a P2MP cross-connect. The details of this will be 
             covered in a separate ID [6].  

             Length (in bytes) : 0

          5. Capability Type : Bulk Transaction = 0x05 (defined in section 
             5.4.1.2).

     5.4 GSMP Message Extensions for Access Node Control 

     5.4.1 General Extensions 

        Extensions to GSMP messages for various use-cases of “Acess Node 
        Control” mechanism are defined in sections 5.4.2 to 5.4.4. However, 
        sub-sections 5.4.1.1 and 5.4.1.2 below define extensions to GSMP that 
        have general applicability.     

     5.4.1.1  Extension TLV 

        In order to provide flexibility and extensibility certain GSMP 
        messages such as “PORT MANAGEMENT” and “EVENT” messages defined in 
        [4] have been modified to include an extension block that follows a 
        TLV structure. Individual messages in the following sections describe 
        the usage and format of the extension block.

              An 8-bit field corresponding to the message type where the   
              extension block is used. 

           Tech Type 

              An 8-bit field indicating the applicable technology type value.      
              The Message Type plus the Tech Value uniquely define a single    
              Extension Type and can be treated as a single 16 bit extension 
              type. “Tech Type” value of 0x05 SHOULD be used by ANCP for DSL 
              technology.

              field in bytes.  When the Tech Type = 0x00, the length value 
              MUST be set to 0. 

           Extension Value 

              A variable length field that is an integer number of 32 bit 
              words long.  The Extension Value field is interpreted according 
              to the specific definitions provided by the messages in the 
              following sections. 

     5.4.1.2  Bulk Transaction Message 

        ANCP elements MAY support a bulk transaction capability.  This 
        capability is negotiated during adjacency synchronization and follows 
        general ANCP capability negotiation rules.  

        In a bulk transaction, several messages can be bundled together in a 
        single transaction. Bulk transaction uses message type 13. Reception 
        of “Bulk Transaction Message” by a node that has not advertised bulk 
        transaction capability MUST silently discard the received message. 

        The Bulk Transaction message has the following format: 

      
            0                   1                   2                   3

        In a Bulk Transaction Message, each of the message in the payload is   
        framed with a complete header and is acted on individually.  The   
        response to the Bulk Transaction message contains the response   
        message that would have been generated by each of the messages had it 
        been sent individually. Each response message will have the 
        appropriate result and code field filled. Any message can be included 
        in the bulk Transaction message except for adjacency message and 
        another bulk transaction message. If a prohibited message is included 
        in a bulk Transaction message, it MUST be included in the Bulk 
        response with a failure response. The response code for that failure 
        is 0x81 (“Message type prohibited in bulk Transaction”). While the 
        individual message would fail, this would not   constitute a failure 
        for the Bulk Transaction message 

     5.4.2 Topology Discovery Extensions 

     The GSMP Event message with PORT UP message type (80) is used for 
     conveying DSL line attributes to the NAS. The version field should be 
     set to 3, and the sub field should be set to 1. The I and subMessage 
     fields SHOULD be set to 1 to signify no fragmentation. The Port and 
     Label fields should be set to 0. The “Port Session Number” should be set 
     to 0, and the “Event Sequence Number” should be 0. The Tech Type field 
     is extended with new type "DSL". The value for this field is 0x05. The 
     message SHOULD be generated when a line first comes UP, or any of the 
     attributes of the line change e.g. the line re-trains to a different 
     rate or one or more of the configured line attributes are 
     administratively modified. Also, when the ANCP session first comes up, 
     the DSLSM SHOULD transmit a PORT UP message to the NAS for each line 
     that is up. A DSLAM MAY use a Bulk Transaction message as defined in 
     5.4.1.2 to aggregate the transmission of PORT UP messages. 

     When a DSL line goes down (idle or silent), the DSLAM SHOULD transmit an 
     Event message with PORT DOWN message type (81) to the NAS. It is 
     recommended that the DSLAMs use a dampening mechanism per DSL line to 
     control the rate of state changes per DSL line, communicated to the NAS.

     The “Extension Value” contains one or more TLVs to identify a DSL line 
     and define it’s characteristics. A TLV can consist of multiple sub-TLVs. 
     First 2 byte of the “Extension Value” contains the number of TLVs that 
     follow. The next 2 bytes contain the total length of the TLVs carried in 
     the extension block in bytes (existing “Block Length” field in the GSMP 
     message is limited to 255 bytes and is not sufficient).

     The value field in each TLV is padded to a 4-octet alignment. The Length 
     field in each TLV contains the actual number of bytes in the TLV (not 
     including the padding if present). If a TLV is not understood by the 
     NAS, it is silently ignored. Currently defined types start from 0x01. 

     Following TLVs are currently defined: 

       1. Type (Access-Loop-Circuit-ID = 0x01): This is a mandatory TLV and 
          contains an identifier of the subscriber’s connection to the access 
          node (i.e.  “local loop”). The “local loop” can be ATM based or 
          Ethernet based. The “Access Loop Circuit ID” has local significance 
          at the access node. The exact usage on the NAS is beyond the scope 
          of this document. The format used for “local loop” identification 
          in ANCP messages MUST be identical to what is used by the access 
          nodes in subscriber signaling messages when the access nodes act as 
          “signaling relay agents” as outlined in [7] and [8]. 

          Length : (upto 63 bytes)  

          Value : ASCII string.                       

          For an ATM based local loop the string consists of slot/port and   
          VPI/VCI information corresponding to the subscriber’s DSL 
          connection. Default syntax for the string inserted by the access 
          node as per [8] is: 

           “Access-Node-Identifier atm slot/port:vpi.vci”  

          The Access-Node-Identifier uniquely identifies the access node in 
          the access network. The slot/port and VPI/VCI uniquely identifies 
          the DSL line on the access node. Also, there is one to one 

      
      
     Wadhwa et.al           Expires August 25, 2007                [Page 23]

          correspondence between DSL line and the VC between the access node 
          and the NAS.  

           For local loop which is Ethernet based (and tagged), the string 
           consists of slot/port and VLAN tag corresponding to the 
           subscriber. Default syntax for the string inserted by the access 
           node as per [8] is: 

            "Access-Node-Identifier eth slot/port[:vlan-id]"  
      
           
       2. Type (Access-Loop-Remote-Id = 0x02): This is an optional TLV and 
          contains an identifier to uniquely identify a user on a local loop 
          on the access node. The exact usage on the NAS is out of scope of 
          this document. It is desirable that the format used for the field 
          is similar to what is used by the access nodes in subscriber 
          signaling messages when the access nodes act as “signaling relay 
          agents” as outlined in [7] and [8]. 

          Length : (upto 63 bytes) 

          Value  :  ASCII string 

               

       3. Type (Access-Aggregation-Circuit-ID-Binary = 0x06) 

          Length : (8 bytes)  

          Value : two 32 bit integers. 

          For ethernet access aggregation, where a per-subscriber (stacked) 
          VLAN can be applied (1:1 model defined in [8]), the VLAN stack 
          provides a convenient way to uniquely identify the DSL line. The 
          outer VLAN is equivalent to virtual path between a DSLAM and the 
          NAS and inner VLAN is equivalent to a virtual circuit on a per DSL 
          line basis. In this scenario, any subscriber data received by the 
          access node and transmitted out the uplink to the aggregation 
          network will be tagged with the VLAN stack assigned by the access 
          node 

          This TLV can carry the VLAN tags assigned by the access node in the 
          ANCP messages. The VLAN tags can uniquely identify the DSL line 
          being referred to in the ANCP messages, assuming the VLAN tags are 
          not in any way translated in the aggregation network and are unique 
          across physical ports. Each 32 bit integer (least significant bits) 

      
      
     Wadhwa et.al           Expires August 25, 2007                [Page 24] 
         
     Internet-Draft       draft-ietf-ancp-protocol-00        August 2007 
         

          contains a 12 bit VLAN identifier (which is part of the VLAN tag 
          defined by IEEE 802.1Q). 

          Also, in case of an ATM aggregation network, where the DSLAM is 
          directly connected to the NAS (without an intermediate ATM switch), 
          the two values can contain VPI and VCI on the DSLAM uplink (and can 
          uniquely identify the DSL line on the DSLAM). 

          This TLV is optional. 

      

       4. Type (Access-Aggregation-Circuit-ID-ASCII = 0x03) 

          Length : (upto 63 bytes)  

          Value : ASCII string. 

          This field contains information pertaining to an uplink on the 
          access node. For Ethernet access aggregation, assuming the access 
          node assigns VLAN tags (1:1 model), typical format for the string 
          is: 

          “Access-Node-Identifier eth slot/port [:inner-vlan-id][:outer-vlan-id]”   

          The slot/port corresponds to the ethernet uplink on the access node 
          towards the NAS. 

          For an ATM aggregation network, typical format for the string is: 

          “Access-Node-Identifier atm slot/port:vpi.vci” 

          This TLV allows the NAS to associate the information contained in 
          the ANCP messages to the DSL line on the access node. 

          If the access node inserts this string in the ANCP messages, when 
          referring to local loop characteristics (e.g. DSL line in case of a 
          DSLAM), then it should be able to map the information contained in 
          the string uniquely to the local loop (e.g. DSL line). 

          On the NAS, the information contained in this string can be used to 
          derive an “aggregation network” facing construct (e.g. an IP 
          interface) corresponding to the local loop (e.g. DSL line). The 
          association could be based on “local configuration” on the NAS. 

          The access node can also convey to the NAS, the characteristics 
          (e.g. bandwidth) of the uplink on the access node. This TLV then 
      
      
     Wadhwa et.al           Expires August 25, 2007                [Page 25]

          serves the purpose of uniquely identifying the uplink whose 
          characteristics are being defined. A separate set of sub-TLVs will 
          be defined for the uplink characteristics (TBD). 

          This TLV is optional. 

          

       5. Type (DSL Line Attributes = 0x04): 

          Length : variable (up to 1024 bytes) 

          Value : This consists of one or more Sub-TLVs corresponding to DSL     
          line attributes. No sub-TLVs other than the “DSL type” and “DSL 
          line state” SHOULD be included in a PORT DOWN message. 

          The general format of the sub-TLVs is identical to the general TLV   
          format. The value field in each sub-TLV is padded to a 4-octet 
          alignment. The Length field in each sub-TLV contains the actual 
          number of bytes in the TLV (not including the padding if present). 
          Current defined sub-TLV types are start from 0x81. 

          Following sub-TLVs are currently defined : 

          . Type (DSL-Type = 0x91) : Defines the type of transmission system 
             in use. This is a mandatory TLV. 

             Length :  (4 bytes)   

             Value  : (Transmission system : ADSL1 = 0x01, ADSL2 = 0x02,     
             ADSL2+ = 0x03, VDSL1 = 0x04, VDSL2 = 0x05, SDSL = 0x06, UNKNOWN 
             = 0x07). 

          . Type (Actual-Data-Rate-Upstream = 0x81) : Actual data rate 
             upstream of a synchronized DSL line. This is a mandatory TLV. 
             This rate value and all the subsequent ones account for the DSL 
             overhead (i.e. signify the net rate).   

            Length  :  (4 bytes) 

            Value   : (Rate in Kb/sec) 

          . Type (Actual-Data-Rate-Downstream = 0x82) : Actual data rate 
             downstream of a synchronized DSL line. This is a mandatory TLV. 

             Length :  (4 bytes)

             rate that can be attained on the DSL line. This is an optional 
             TLV.

             Value   : (Rate in Kb/sec) 

          . Type (Attainable-Data-Rate-Downstream = 0x86) : Maximum 
             downstream rate that can be attained on the DSL line. This is  
             an optional TLV.

          . Type (DSL line state = 0x8F) : The state of the DSL line. For 
             PORT UP message, at this time, the TLV is optional (since the 
             message type implicitly conveys the state of the line). For PORT 
             DOWN, the TLV is mandatory, since it further communicates the 
             state of the line as IDLE or SILENT.  

            Length  :  (4 bytes)

             This is an optional TLV. However, when this TLV is present, the 
             data link protocol MUST minimally be indicated. The 
             encapsulation overhead can be optionally indicated. 

              Length  :  (3 bytes)

     5.4.3 Line Configuration Extensions 

     The NAS uses extension block in the Port Management messages to convey 
     service attributes of the DSL lines to the DSLAM. TLVs are defined for      
     DSL line identification and service data for the DSL lines. Port number 
     is set to 0 in the message. A new action type "Configure Connection 
     Service Data" (value 0x8) is defined. The "Function" field is set to the 
     action type. This action type indicates to the device being controlled 
     (access-node i.e. DSLAM) to apply service configuration data contained 
     in the extension value (TLVs), to the DSL line (identified by one of the 
     TLVs in the extension value). The Tech Type field is extended with new

        The format of the "Extension Value" field is as follows: 
         
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
        |             # of TLVs         | Extension Block length (bytes)|

        |                                                               | 
        ~                                                               ~ 
        ~                            TLVs                               ~  
        |                                                               | 
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      

        The “Extension Value” field contains one or more TLVs containing DSL 
        line identifier and desired service attributes of the the DSL line. 
        First 2 byte of the “Extension Value” contains the number of TLVs 
        that follow. The next 2 bytes contain the total length of the 
        extension block in bytes (existing “Block Length” field in the GSMP 
        message is limited to 255 bytes and is not sufficient). 

        General format of a TLV is:  

         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+        
        |            Type               |             Length            | 
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+             
        |                                                               | 
        ~                                                               ~ 
        ~                           Value                               ~  
        |                                                               | 
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
         

        The value field is padded to a 4-octet alignment. The Length field in 
        each TLV contains the actual number of bytes in the TLV (not 
        including the padding if present). If a TLV is not understood by the 
        access-node, it is silently ignored. Depending upon the deployment 
        scenario, the NAS may specify “Access Loop Circuit-ID” or the “Access 
        Aggregation Circuit-ID) as defined in section 5.4.1. Following TLVs 
        can appear in this message: 

        o  Type (Access-Loop-Circuit-ID = 0x01) : defined in section 5.4.1

     Internet-Draft       draft-ietf-ancp-protocol-00        August 2007 
         

        o  Type (Access-Aggregation-Circuit-ID-Binary = 0x06): defined in 
           section 5.4.1. 

        o  Type (Access-Aggregation-Circuit-ID-ASCII = 0x03): defined in 
           section 5.4.1.      

        o  Type (Service-Profile-Name = 0x05): Reference to a pre-configured 
           profile on the DSLAM that contains service specific data for the 
           subscriber.    

           Length : (upto 64 bytes) 

           Value  : ASCII string containing the profile name (NAS learns  
           from a policy server after a subscriber is authorized). 

        In future, more TLVs MAY be defined for individual service attributes 
        of a DSL line (e.g. rates, interleaving delay,  multicast channel 
        entitlement access-list etc). 

         

     5.4.4 OAM Extensions 

        GSMP “Port Management” message (type 32) SHOULD be used by the NAS to 
        trigger access node to run a loopback test on the local loop. The 
        message format is defined in section 5.4.2. The version field SHOULD 
        be set to 3 and sub-version field SHOULD be set to 1. The remaining 
        fields in the GSMP header have standard semantics. The function type 
        used in the request message SHOULD be set to “remote loopback” (type 
        = 0x09). The port, “port session number”, “event sequence number”, 
        duration, “event flags”, “flow control flags” and code fields SHOULD 
        all be set to 0. The result field SHOULD be set to “AckAll” to 
        indicate requirement for the access node to send a success for 
        failure response. The transaction ID SHOULD contain a sequence number 
        inserted by the NAS in each request that it generates. The extension 
        field format is also defined above in section 5.4.2. The extension 
        value field can contain one or more TLVs including the access-line 
        identifier on the DSLAM and OAM test characteristics desired by the 
        NAS.  

        The TLV format is defined above in section 5.4.2. The value field is 
        padded to a 4-octet alignment. The Length field in each TLV contains 
        the actual number of bytes in the TLV (not including the padding if 
        present). If a TLV is not understood by the NAS, it is silently 
        ignored. Depending upon the deployment scenario, the NAS may specify 
        “Access Loop Circuit-ID” or the “Access Aggregation Circuit-ID) as 
        defined in section 5.4.1. Following TLVs can appear in this message:

        o  Type (Access-Loop-Circuit-ID = 0x01) : defined in section 5.4.1  

        o  Type (Access-Aggregation-Circuit-ID-Binary = 0x06): defined in 
           section 5.4.1. 

        o  Type (Access-Aggregation-Circuit-ID-ASCII = 0x03): defined in 
           section 5.4.1.  

        o  Type (OAM-Loopback-Test-Parameters = 0x07): Parameters related to  
           loopback test. This is an optional TLV. If this TLV is not present 
           in the request message, the DSLAM SHOULD use locally determined 
           default values for the test parameters.  

           Length: 4 bytes 

           Value  : two 1 byte numbers described below (listed in order of 
           most to least  significant). Thus, the 4 bytes consist of 1 byte 
           of Count, followed by 1 byte of Timeout, followed by two pad bytes 
           of zero. 

            o  Count (1 byte) : Number of loopback cells/messages that should 
               be generated on the local loop as part of the loopback test. 
               The NAS SHOULD restrict the “count” to be greater than 0 and 
               less than or equal to 32. The DSLAM SHOULD discard the request 
               for a loopback test, if the received test parameters contain 
               an out of range value for the “count” field. The DSLAM MAY 
               optionally send a failure response to the NAS with the code 
               “invalid test parameter”.         

            o  Timeout (1 byte) : Upper bound on the time in seconds that the 
               NAS would wait for a response from the DSLAM. If the total 
               time taken by the DSLAM to complete a test with requested 
               parameters, exceeds the specified “timeout” value, it can 
               choose to omit the generation of a response to the NAS. DSLAM 
               SHOULD use a locally determined value for the “timeout”, if 
               the received value of the “timeout” parameter is 0. 

              

        o  Type (Opaque-Data = 0x08) : This is an optional TLV. If present in 
           the request message, the DSLAM SHOULD reflect it back in the 
           response unmodified. 

           Length : 8 bytes

     Internet-Draft       draft-ietf-ancp-protocol-00        August 2007 
         

           Value : Two 32 bit integers inserted by the NAS (not to be 
           interpreted by the DSLAM, but just reflected back in the 
           response). 

        The access node generates a success or failure response when it deems 
        the loopback test to be complete. “Port Management” message (type 32) 
        is used. The result field SHOULD be set to success or failure. The 
        function type SHOULD be set to 0x09. The transaction ID SHOULD be 
        copied from the sequence number contained in the corresponding 
        request. The other parameters not explicitly defined here SHOULD be 
        set as specified in the request message above. The code field SHOULD 
        be set to a value in the range 0x500 to 0x5ff (to be reserved with 
        IANA) to indicate the status of the executed test. The valid values 
        defined are (can be extended in future): 

              0x500 : Specified access line does not exist. 

              0x501 : Loopback test timed out. 

              0x502 : Reserved 

              0x503 : DSL line status showtime. 

              0x504 : DSL line status idle. 

              0x505 : DSL line status silent. 

              0x506 : DSL line status training. 

              0x507 : DSL line integrity error. 

              0x508 : DSLAM resource not available. 

              0x509 : Invalid test parameter. 

     The Extension value can contain one or more TLVs including the TLV to 
     identify the access line on which the test was performed, and details 
     from executing the test. The access line identifier SHOULD be identical 
     to what was contained in the request. The relevant TLVs are: 

        o  Type (Access-Loop-Circuit-ID = 0x01) : defined in section 5.4.1  

        o  Type (Access-Aggregation-Circuit-ID-Binary = 0x06): defined in 
           section 5.4.1. 

        o  Type (Access-Aggregation-Circuit-ID-ASCII = 0x03): defined in 
           section 5.4.1.

     Internet-Draft       draft-ietf-ancp-protocol-00        August 2007 
         

        o  Type (Opaque-Data = 0x08) : Data inserted by the NAS in the 
           request reflected back by the DSLAM. 

           Length : 8 bytes 

           Value : Two 32 bit integers as received in the request (opaque to 
           the DSLAM). 

        o  Type (OAM-Loopback-Test-Response-String = 0x09) 

           Length (upto 128 bytes) 

           Value : Suitably formatted ASCII string containing useful details 
           about the test that the NAS will display for the operator, exactly 
           as received from the DSLAM (no manipulation/interpretation by the 
           NAS). This is an optional TLV, but it is strongly recommended, 
           that in case of ATM based local loop, the DSLAM at the very least 
           indicates via this TLV, the total loopback cells generated and the 
           total loopback cells successfully received as part of executing 
           the requested loopback test.      

             

     5.5 ATM-specific considerations 

        The topology discovery and line configuration involve the DSL line 
        attributes. For ATM based access networks, the DSL line on the DSLAM 
        is identified by the port and PVP/PVC corresponding to the 
        subscriber. The DSLAMs are connected to the NAS via an ATM access 
        aggregation network. Since, the   DSLAM (access-node) is not directly 
        connected to the NAS, the NAS needs a mechanism to learn the DSL line 
        identifier (more generally referred to as "Access Loop Circuit-ID") 
        corresponding to a subscriber. The "Access loop circuit-ID" has no 
        local significance on the NAS. The ANCP messages for topology 
        discovery and line configuration carry opaque "Access loop Circuit-
        ID" which has only local significance on the DSLAMs.  

        The access loop circuit identifier can be carried as an ASCII string 
        in the ANCP messages. This allows ANCP to be decoupled from the 
        specifics of the underlying access technology being controlled. On 
        the other hand, this requires a NAS mechanism by which such 
        identifier can be correlated to the context of an “aggregation 
        network” facing IP interface (corresponding to the subscriber) on the 
        NAS. This would typically require local configuration of such IP 
        interfaces, or of the underlying ATM interfaces.

     5.6 Ethernet-specific considerations 

     One possible way of approaching the use of Ethernet technology in the 
     access aggregation network is to recreate the equivalent of Virtual 
     Paths (VPs) and Virtual Circuits (VCs) by using stacked Virtual LAN 
     tags. As an example, one could use an “outer” VLAN to create a form of 
     “virtual path” between a given DSLAM and a given NAS. And then use 
     “inner” VLAN tags to create a form of “virtual circuit” on a per DSL 
     line basis. In this case, VLAN tags conveyed in topology discovery and 
     line configuration messages will allow to uniquely identify the DSL line 
     in a straightforward manner, assuming the VLAN tags are not translated 
     in some way by the aggregation network, and are unique across physical 
     ports. 
      
     However, some carriers do not wish to use this “connection oriented” 
     approach. Therefore, an alternative model is to bridge sessions from 
     multiple subscribers behind a DSLAM to a single VLAN in the aggregation 
     network. This is the N:1 model. In this model, or in the case where user 
     traffic is sent untagged, the access node needs to insert the exact 
     identity of the DSL line in the topology discovery and line 
     configuration messages, and then have a mechanism by which this can be 
     correlated to the context of an “aggregation network” facing IP 
     interface (for the subscriber) on the NAS. This can either be based on 
     local configuration on the NAS, or on the fact that such DSLAM (access 
     node) typically inserts the “Access Loop Circuit ID” in subscriber 
     signaling messages relayed to the NAS (i.e. DHCP or PPPoE discovery 
     messages). 
       
     Section 5.4.1 defines “Access Loop Circuit ID”.  
                                                                     

     6  IANA Considerations 

        New Tech-Type, capability types, sub-TLV types related to topology 
        discovery and line configuration will need to be reserved. 

     7  Security Considerations 

        The NAS and DSLAMs are implicitly in a trusted domain, so security        
        for ANCP is not a strong requirement. However, if needed security can 
        be provided using IP security as indicated in [RFC3293].
