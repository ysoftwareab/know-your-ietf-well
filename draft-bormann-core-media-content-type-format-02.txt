         On Media-Types, Content-Types, and related terminology
            draft-bormann-core-media-content-type-format-02

Abstract

   There is a lot of confusion about media-types, content-types, and
   related terminology.

   This memo is an attempt at clearing it up, so we can use consistent
   terminology in CoRE and related specifications.  It also defines some
   ABNF that can be used in these specifications.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC1590] introduced media types and their registration.  That
   document took MIME types from [RFC1521] and gave them a new name.  At
   that time, the term "media type" was often used just for the major
   type ("text", "audio"), and what we call a media-type now was the
   combination of a type and a subtype.  This lives on in [RFC6838],
   which does not even have an ABNF [RFC5234] production for media type.
   [RFC6838]'s predecessor, [RFC4288], supplied the ABNF shown in
   (Figure 1).

                 type-name = reg-name
                 subtype-name = reg-name

                 reg-name = 1*127reg-name-chars
                 reg-name-chars = ALPHA / DIGIT / "!" /
                                  "#" / "$" / "&" / "." /
                                  "+" / "-" / "^" / "_"

             Figure 1: ABNF for type and subtype, from RFC 4288

   [RFC4288] contains the semantically equivalent ABNF in Figure 2,
   which also provides comments that limit the use of "." and "+".

   subtype-name = restricted-name

2.  Media-Type

   However, the term "media type" is now generally used for a registered
   combination of a type-name and a subtype-name.  We further
   disambiguate by calling this a media type name, as, in ABNF:

   Media-Type-Name = type-name "/" subtype-name

   For the purposes of this memo, we define:

   Media-Type-Name:  A combination of a type-name and a subtype-name
      registered in [IANA.media-types], conventionally identified by the
      two names separated by a slash.

   (This leaves the term "Media Type" for the actual specification that
   is registered under the Media-Type-Name.)

3.  Content-Type

   Media types can have parameters [RFC6838], some of which are
   mandatory.  In HTTP and many other protocols, these are then used in
   a "Content-Type" header field.  HTTP [RFC7231] uses:

      Content-Type = media-type
      media-type = type "/" subtype *( OWS ";" OWS parameter )
      type       = token
      subtype    = token
      token          = 1*tchar
      tchar          = "!" / "#" / "$" / "%" / "&" / "'" / "*"
                     / "+" / "-" / "." / "^" / "_" / "`" / "|" / "~"
                     / DIGIT / ALPHA
      OWS        = *( SP / HTAB )

Internet-Draft                Content-Types                  August 2020


   We don't follow this inclusive use established by [RFC2616], parts of
   which became [RFC7231], namely to use the term media-type for a
   Media-Type-Name with parameters; note that [RFC2616] was quite
   confused about this by claiming (Section 3.7):

      Media-type values are registered with the Internet Assigned Number
      Authority (IANA [19]).

   This clearly reverts to the understanding of Media-Type-Name we use.
   We instead define as a separate term:

   Content-Type:  A Media-Type-Name, optionally associated with
      parameters (separated from the media type name and from each other
      by a semicolon).

   Removing the legacy HTAB characters now shunned in polite
   conversation, as well as some other cobwebs, we define the
   conventional textual representation of a Content-Type as:

   Content-Type   = Media-Type-Name *( *SP ";" *SP parameter )
   parameter      = token "=" ( token / quoted-string )

   token          = 1*tchar
   tchar          = "!" / "#" / "$" / "%" / "&" / "'" / "*"
                  / "+" / "-" / "." / "^" / "_" / "`" / "|" / "~"
                  / DIGIT / ALPHA
   quoted-string  = %x22 *qdtext %x22
   qdtext         = SP / %x21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-7E

   Note that there is a slight inconsistency between the "token" used
   here and the "reg-name"/"restricted-name" used above; since media
   type parameters probably will be defined within the guard rails set
   by [RFC7231], we need to use HTTP's more comprehensive definition
   here.

4.  Content-Coding

   [RFC2616] also introduced the term Content-Coding, a registered name
   for an encoding transformation that has been or can be applied to a
   representation:

   content-coding   = token

   Confusingly, in HTTP the Content-Coding is then given in a header
   field called "Content-Encoding"; we NEVER use this term (except when
   we are in error).  Instead we define:

   Content-Coding:  a registered name for an encoding transformation

Internet-Draft                Content-Types                  August 2020


      that has been or can be applied to a representation.

   Content-Codings are registered in the HTTP Content Coding Registry, a
   subregistry of [IANA.http-parameters].  We often use the "identity"
   Content-Coding, which is the identity transformation, and often fail
   to identify that Content-Coding by name, instead calling it "no
   Content-Coding".

5.  Content-Format

   CoAP [RFC7252] defines a Content-Format as the combination of a
   Content-Type and a Content-Coding, identified by a numeric identifier
   defined by the "CoAP Content-Formats" registry (a subregistry of
   [IANA.core-parameters]), but in more confusing words (it did not have
   the benefit of the present memo).

   Content-Format:  the combination of a Content-Type and a Content-
      Coding, identified by a numeric identifier defined by the "CoAP
      Content-Formats" registry.

   Note that there has not been a conventional string representation of
   just the combination of a Content-Type and a Content-Coding; Content-
   Formats so far always are identified by their registered Content-
   Format numbers.  However, there are applications where that is useful
   [I-D.keranen-core-senml-data-ct], so we define:

   Content-Format = 1*DIGIT
   Content-Format-String   = Content-Type ["@" content-coding]

   This allows the use of Content-Format-Strings such as "application/
   json@deflate" in place of the less self-describing content-format
   "11050", or other combinations that do not have a content-format
   number defined yet.

   Content-Format-Strings MUST NOT explicitly use the content-coding
   value of "identity" (i.e., if an identity content-coding is desired,
   the entire optional part including the "@" sign is left out).

   Note that a quoted string inside a content-type parameter might
   contain an "@" sign, so the parsing of Content-Format-Strings cannot
   be done in a too simplistic way.

6.  Abbreviations

   Media type names are sometimes abbreviated as "mt", and Content-Types
   as "ct".  We propose not to use those abbreviations: Where the long
   form of the values can be used, the long form "Content-Type" can also
   be used to name them.

Internet-Draft                Content-Types                  August 2020


   For historical reasons, both [RFC6690] and [RFC7252] use the
   abbreviation "ct" for Content-Format (think first and last
   character).

   For Content-Coding, the abbreviation "cc" can be used.

7.  Discussion

   The ABNF given here is provisional and needs to be cleaned up: We
   need to unify the various forms of reg-name, token, etc.

   (ABNF just shown for illustration is centered and tagged with
   "abnf;old" in the XML, while the normative ABNF of this memo is left-
   aligned and tagged with "abnf".)

   We need to discuss case-insensitivity, which is usually rather
   insensitive.

8.  IANA Considerations

   While this memo talks a lot about IANA registries, it does not
   require any action from IANA.

9.  Security Considerations

   Confusion about terminology may, in the worst case, cause security
   problems.  No other security considerations are known to be raised by
   the present memo.
