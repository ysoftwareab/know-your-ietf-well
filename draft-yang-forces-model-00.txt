     1. Abstract 
        This document defines a functional model for ForCES forwarding 
        elements (FEs).  This model is used to describe the state of ForCES 
        forwarding elements within the context of the ForCES protocol, so 
        that ForCES control elements (CEs) can control the FEs accordingly. 
        The model is to specify what logical function instances are present 
        in the FEs and in what order these functions are performed. The 
      
      
     Internet Draft         ForCES FE Functional Model          June 2002 
      
      
        forwarding element model defined herein is intended to satisfy the 
        requirements specified in the ForCES requirements draft [FORCES-
        REQ].  Using this model, predefined or vendor specific logical 
        functions can be expressed and configured. However, the definition 
        of these components are not described and defined in this document. 
        Definitions 
         
        A set of terminology associated with the ForCES requirements is 
        defined in [FORCES-REQ] and is not copied here. The following list 
        of terminology is relevant to the FE model defined in this document. 
         
        Datapath -- A conceptual path taken by packets within the forwarding 
        plane, inside an FE. There might exist more than one datapath within 
        an FE. 
         
        Forwarding Element (FE) Block -- An abstraction of the basic packet 
        processing functions in the datapath. It is the building block of FE 
        functionality. This concept abstracts away implementation details 
        from the parameters of interest for configuration, control and 
        management by CE. The general rule of thumb on the granularity of FE 
        blocks is that FE blocks should be coarse grained, stateful and 
        focus on a particular domain. For example, RFC1812 compliant IPv4 
        forwarder, classifiers, meters, etc..  
         
        Forwarding Element (FE) Stage -- Representation of a FE block 
        instance in a FE's datapath. As a packet flows through an FE along a 
        datapath, it flows through one or multiple distinct stages, with 
        each stage implementing an instance of a certain logical function. 
        There may be one or more combination of such instances  in a FE's 
        datapath.  Using NAT as an example, one NAT function is typically 
        performed before the forwarding stage (packets arriving externally 
        have their public addresses replaced with private addresses) and one 
        NAT function is performed after (for packets exiting the domain, 
        their private addresses are replaced by public ones). So there are 
        three stages (NAT, forwarding, and NAT again) in this example FE, 
        with two NAT instances present in two different stages.  
      
     2. Motivation and Requirements of FE model 
      
        The ForCES architecture allows Forwarding Elements (FEs) of varying 
        functionality to participate in a ForCES network element (NE).  The 
        implication of this varying functionality is that CEs can make only 
        minimal assumptions about the functionality provided by its FEs.  
        Before CEs can configure and control the forwarding behavior of FEs, 
        CEs need to query and discover the capabilities and state of their 
        FEs.  [FORCES-REQ] mandates that this capability and state 
        information be expressed in the form of a FE model, and this model 
        will be used as the basis for CEs to control FEs' capabilities and 
        manipulate FEs' state via ForCES protocol.     
         
        [FORCES-REQ] describes all the requirements placed on the FE model 
        in detail. We provide a brief summary here to highlight some of the 
        design issues we face.

          . The FE model MUST express what logical functions can be applied 
             to packets as they pass through a FE. 
          . The FE model MUST be capable of supporting/allowing variations 
             in the way logical functions are implemented on a FE.  
          . The model MUST be capable of describing the order in which 
             these logical functions are applied in a FE.  
          . The FE model SHOULD be extendable and should have provision to 
             express new or vendor specific logical functions. .  
          . Should be able to support  minimal set of logical functions 
             that are already identified  such as  port functions, 
             forwarding functions, QoS functions, filtering functions, high-
             touch functions, security functions, and vendor-specific 
             functions.  
         
        Since the motivation of an FE model is to allow CEs later to control 
        and configure FEs' behavior via ForCES protocol, it becomes 
        essential to examine and understand what kind of control and 
        configuration CEs might do to FEs. We believe that there are roughly 
        three levels of control and configuration that CEs can do to FEs.  
         
        The first level of control and configuration is the simplest of all. 
        It assumes that each FE's capability is already given and remains 
        static in its lifetime, and CEs can only control its behavior by 
        manipulating its state. We call this "static FE" control and 
        configuration. For example, Figure 2 and 3 each shows an FE 
        configuration example by representing the processing steps in a 
        directed  graph interconnecting all the functional stages that 
        packets can possibly traverse. If such a configuration remains 
        static during FE's lifetime, then all CE can control is the 
        parameters associated with each stage in the graph, for example, the 
        routing table in the LPM forwarder in Figure 2, or the token bucket 
        parameters associated with meter1 in Figure 3. But CE cannot 
        reconfigure the graph topology dynamically, such as adding another 
        meter or queue onto the FE in Figure 3 on the fly. For this kind of 
        static FE control and configuration purpose, the useful FE model is 
        consisted of the state information that FEs allow CEs to manipulate 
        and the statistics and events that FEs can collect and report back 
        to CEs. Such a state model doesn't need to describe a lot of other 
        information, like the packet formats supported between meter1 and 
        counter1 in Figure 3, for example. Because such information is only 
        useful when the graph is re-configured dynamically on the fly.    
         
        The second level of control and configuration builds on top of the 
        first that is just described. Using Figure 3 as an example, instead 
        of presenting the static FE graph to CE, FE can convey its 
        capabilities to CE by telling CE that "This FE can support one 
        classifier with up to N filters. This FE can also support M meters, 
        X queues, etc." We call this dynamic FE control and configuration. 
        For such control and configuration, a more powerful and flexible FE 
        capability model is required in addition to the FE state model. For 
        example, it becomes necessary to model the capability of the 
        building blocks like classifiers, filters, meters etc. it also needs 
      
     Yang, et. al.      Expires December 2002                    [Page 3] 
     Internet Draft         ForCES FE Functional Model          June 2002 
      
      
        to describe the packet formats supported at each input and output of 
        each block to allow correct reconfiguration of the graph by CE.  
         
        The third level of control and configuration is even more powerful 
        and future looking. In addition to dynamic configuration, CEs might 
        even be allowed to download a given functionality onto FEs at run 
        time. 
        The FE model proposed in this document intends to fully support the 
        static FE control and configuration. It is also our intention to 
        allow extension later to support dynamic FE control and 
        configuration. However, this FE model currently makes no attempt to 
        address issues beyond the simple static FE control and 
        configuration. 
      
     3. Capability and configuration Model versus State Model 
      
        FE Model describes both the static capabilities and the configured 
        capabilities. At any time after initial configuration the logical 
        functions associated with an FE model may exhibit different 
        characteristics and may lead to change in state of FE.   The 
        capability describes set of parameters or attributes of  one or more  
        logical functions of a FE, which may be useful for configuring and 
        managing a FE. The state model describes the instantaneous values or 
        operational behaviour of a FE. 
        Typical  capabilities model describes at the coarsest level such 
        aspects as 
        - this FE can handle IPv4 and IPv6 
        - this FE can perform 6-tuple classification (or can only do DA 
        based processing, ...) 
        - this FE can perform metering 
        - this FE can handle multiple queues with multiple priorities 
        - this FE can add and remove encapsulating headers of types: IPSec, 
        GRE, L2TP 
         
        Where it gets more complicated is coping with the detailed limits.   
        Issues such has how many classifiers can the FE handle?  
        How many headers can the FE add and remove?  How many queues, and 
        how many buffer pools can the FE support?  How many meters can the 
        FE provide?  How flexibly can these various parts be interconnected? 
        While one could try to build an object model for representing 
        capabilities in full, other efforts have found this to be a 
        significant undertaking.  A middle of the road approach is to define 
        coarse-grained capabilities and simple capacity measures.  Then, if 
        the CE attempts to instruct the FE to set up some specific behavior 
        it is not capable of, the FE will return an error indicating the 
        problem. 
         
        A state model describes the current state of the FE.  It lists 
        - on a given port the packets are classified using a given 
        classification filter 
        - a given classifier results in packets being metered in a certain 
        way, and then marked in a certain way

        - packets coming from specific markers are delivered into a shared 
        queue for handling, while other packets are delivered to a different 
        queue 
        - a specific scheduler with specific behavior and parameters will 
        service these collected queues. 
         
        While the DiffServ and QDDIM models are not designed with the 
        primary goal of direct machine implementation, we will start with 
        that model as it is better than no starting point.  Alternative 
        suggestions for a state model which can be implemented more 
        generally without significant transformation are sought from the 
        community. 
      
     4. FE Model 
         
        This section proposes a ForCES FE model to satisfy all the 
        requirements in [FORCES-REQ] for FE control and configuration. The 
        approach taken is to first define a set of well-known FE logical 
        functions (FE blocks) as the basic building blocks, so that any FE 
        can be modeled by describing the kind of FE blocks or variants of 
        these blocks it contains, and how the instances of these blocks are 
        interconnected together. This model also allows new logical 
        functions be added to accommodate future innovation in forwarding 
        plane. We believe this approach strikes a good balance between 
        flexibility and extensibility of the model and ease of use by the 
        CE.   
         
     4.1. FE Blocks 
         
        FE blocks are the very basic building blocks from which FEs model 
        its overall packet processing behavior. The concept of a FE block is 
        akin to that of an abstract base class in object-oriented 
        terminology. Different FEs can have different implementation of the 
        same block, but the packet processing behavior looks the same to the 
        CE. Sometimes it is difficult to decide the granularity of the FE 
        blocks. The general rule of thumb is that FE blocks should be coarse 
        grained, stateful and focus on a particular domain.  Basically, if a 
        logical function doesnÆt have anything to configure, doesnÆt keep 
        any kind of inter-packet state information (tables, etc), then it 
        probably is not a FE block. For example, CRC check and IP checksum 
        are not considered to be FE blocks by themselves, instead should be 
        part of an FE block (i.e. RFC 1812 IP forwarder). 
      
        A well-defined block has a well-defined packet processing behavior, 
        and a well-defined set of state and parameters that CE can 
        potentially configure or control via ForCES.  
         
        Obviously, a namespace is needed to specify different blocks. The 
        namespace assigns a unique ID or label to each distinct block type.  
         
        For each block, it is necessary to specify the relevant information 
        and parameters such as: 
      
     Yang, et. al.      Expires December 2002                    [Page 5] 
     Internet Draft         ForCES FE Functional Model          June 2002 
      
      
        - how many inputs it takes and what kinds of packets and meta data 
        it takes for each input; 
        - how many outputs it produces and what kind of packets and meta 
        data it emits for each output and; 
        - the packet processing (such as modification) behavior; 
        - what information is programmed into it (e.g., LPM list, next hop 
        list, WRED parameters, etc.) and what parameters among them are 
        configurable;  
        - what statistics it keeps (e.g., drop count, CRC error count, 
        etc.);  
        - what events it can throw (e.g., table miss, port down, etc.). 
         
        CEs later use the information to decide how to configure the 
        parameters, how to modify the relevant data structures (like 
        tables), what kind of statistics it can query from FE, and what 
        actions to take once a certain event happens. 
         
        We use the classifier defined in [DS-MODEL] as an example. 
        "Classifiers are 1:N(fan-out) devices: they take a single traffic 
        stream as input and generate N logically separate traffic streams as 
        output. Classifiers are parameterized by filters and output streams. 
        Packets from the input stream are sorted into various output streams 
        by filters which match the contents of the packet or possibly match 
        other attributes associated with the packet." To further define 
        filters: "A filter consists of a set of conditions on the component 
        values of a packet's classification key (the header values, 
        contents, and attributes relevant for classification)." Figure 1 
        illustrates an example classifier. 
          
      
              Unclassified              classified

                      +------------+

              ------->| classifier |--> match Filter2 --> OutputB 
                      |            |--> no match      --> OutputC

     4.2.FE Block Library 
         
        We expect a small set of blocks to be defined initially, e.g., 
        ingress port, egress port, classifier, forwarder, meter, marker, 
        shaper, scheduler, queue, encapsulator, decapsulator, encrypter, 
        decrypter, NAT, mux, demux, header compressor, header decompressor, 
        etc. Such a set of blocks can be viewed as a FE block library. The 
        minimum set of FE functions required in [FORCES_REQ] must be part of 
        this library. It is expected that new FE blocks would be defined and 
        added into this library over time. It is also expected that the FE 
        model itself be decoupled from the ForCES protocol so that extension 
      
     Yang, et. al.      Expires December 2002                    [Page 6] 
     Internet Draft         ForCES FE Functional Model          June 2002 
      
      
        to basic blocks or changes to the existing  blocks  should not 
        impact the protocol itself.  
         
        This document only intends to describe the conceptual FE model and 
        illustrate it with some examples. However, it is not the intention 
        of this document to define any specific block or the library itself. 
        Separate document(s) would be written to achieve that.  
         
     4.3. FE Stage 
         
        As a packet flows through an FE along a datapath, it flows through 
        one or multiple distinct stages, with each stage instantiating a 
        certain FE logical function. So an FE stage is simply an instance of 
        a FE block within an FE's datapath. Each FE allocates a FE-unique 
        stage ID or label to each of its stages and passes the stage ID or 
        label along with the corresponding block name as part of the FE 
        model description. This allows multiple instances of the same block 
        present in a FE's datapath.  
         
        For each stage, the following information must be defined: 
        - its FE-unique stage ID or label to identify, configure and manage 
        the logical block of each by CE.; 
        - the corresponding block name (from the namespace) that this stage 
        instantiating; 
        - all the information for this stage as described in Section 5.1; 
        - the number of downstream stages to which this stage can send 
        packets; 
        - for each downstream stage: its stage ID or label. 
         
     4.4. Directed Graph of FE Blocks 
         
        Once a library of well-understood FE blocks is defined, and a stage 
        is represented as described in 5.3, any static FE can be modeled by 
        a directed graph interconnecting all the stages present in the FE. 
        The static FEs can be defined by identifying all the input stage(s) 
        and specifying each stage as described in Section 5.3. Figure 2 
        shows one simple example of such an FE with three stages.  
         
        To model a static FE, the following information needs to be 
        represented: 
         - number of stages in the FE; 
         - for each stage: define the stage using the model in 5.3; 
         - identify the input stages 
          
        It is frequently necessary to share state between FE functional 
        stages in the forwarding plane. Since this model uses blocks as the 
        basic way of modeling forwarding plane packet processing stages, the 
        state information is exposed as part of connecting stage. For 
        example in Figure 2, stage #2 (IPv4 L3 LPM Forwarder) generates some 
        meta data at its output to carry information on which port the 
        packets should go to, and #3 (Enet-Egress-port-Manager) uses this 
        meta data to direct the packets to the right egress port.

             Figure 3. An FE example with multiple datapath. 
         
      
        There might be more than one datapath within an FE, typically due to 
        blocks that are either 1:N or N:1. Figure 3 shows one such FE block 
        example (based on an example in [MD-MODEL]). This FE implements QoS 
        functions via combination of one or multiple instances of logical 
        functions like classifier, meter, marker, queue, scheduler, etc. 
      
     Yang, et. al.      Expires December 2002                    [Page 8] 
     Internet Draft         ForCES FE Functional Model          June 2002 
      
      
        Some of the functions are 1:N (fan-out_ functions. For example, the 
        stage labeled "Classifier1" is 1:4 function with four downstream 
        stages, namely, Meter1, Queue2, Meter2, Queue4. A packet entering 
        this FE can potentially take one of the six distinct datapath.  
         
        Note that our stage representation can encode largely arbitrary 
        topologies of the stages. The only restrictions on topology relate 
        to the source and sink nature of ingress and egress port functions 
        respectively. For example, egress port functions must not have nay 
        downstream stages whereas no other stage may refer to an ingress 
        port function as one of its downstream stages.  
         
        An FE block may contain zero, one or more ingress port stages. 
        Similarly, an FE block may contain zero, one or more egress port 
        stages. In another word, not every FE block has to contain any 
        ingress port or egress port stages. For example, Figure 4 shows two 
        FE blocks. Block #1 contains one ingress port function but no egress 
        port function, while block #2 contains one egress port function but 
        no ingress port function. It is possible to connect these two FE 
        blocks together to achieve the complete ingress-to-egress packet 
        processing function. This provides the flexibility to spread the 
        functions across multiple FEs and interconnect them together later 
        for certain applications. Figure 4 shows such an example.

     5. Model Representation 
         
        A formal data definition language is needed to represent the FE 
        model described in this document. The following is a list of some 
        potential candidates. A suitable candidate needs to be chosen as the 
        representation of FE model. However, we intend to leave this as an 
        open issue and much debate is needed in the ForCES WG before a 
      
     Yang, et. al.      Expires December 2002                    [Page 9] 
     Internet Draft         ForCES FE Functional Model          June 2002 
      
      
        decision can be made. Therefore, we only provide the candidate list 
        and some initial discussion here without drawing a conclusion yet. 
        - XML (Extensible Markup Language) Schema 
        - ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) 
        - SMI (Structure of Management Information) [RFC1155] 
        - SPPI (Structure of Policy Provisioning Information) [RFC3159] 
        - SMIng (Next Generation Structure of Management Information) 
        - UML (Universal Modeling Language) 
         
        XML has the advantage of being human readable with relatively little 
        effort. However, it is less efficient and requires XML parsing 
        functions in the CE and FE. Currently XML is not widely deployed and 
        used in network elements.  
         
        ASN.1 format is human readable, and widely used in network 
        protocols. SMI is based on a subset of ASN.1 and used to define 
        Management Information Base (MIB) for SNMP. SPPI is the adapted 
        subset of SMI used to define Policy Information Base (PIB) for COPS. 
        SMIng is currently being developed by SMIng working group at IETF 
        and represents a superset of SMIv2 and SPPI. The objective of SMIng 
        is to replace both SMIv2 and SPPI with a single, updated language as 
        the data definition language for the monitoring, configuration, and 
        provisioning of network devices.  
         
         
     6. Security Considerations 
         
        The FE model just describes the representation and organization of 
        data sets and attributes in the forwarding plane. There is no 
        communication protocol associated defined as part of the FE model 
        therefore we do not see any security threats in this model. 
         
     7. Intellectual Property Right 
         
        The authors are not aware of any intellectual property right issues 
        pertaining to this document. 
         
     8. IANA consideration 
         
         
        If we are going to identify and name a new logical components we may 
        need to standardize those components and the attributes.
