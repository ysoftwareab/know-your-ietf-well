                  Figure 1: PWE3 Network Reference Model 
     
     
    A Pseudo Wire (PW) payload is normally relayed across the PW as a 
    single IP or MPLS Packet Switched Network (PSN) Protocol Data Unit 
    (PDU). However, there are cases where the combined size of the 
    payload and its associated PWE3 and PSN headers may exceed the PSN 
    path Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU). When a packet exceeds the MTU 
    of a given network, fragmentation and reassembly will allow the 
    packet to traverse the network and reach its intended destination. 
     
    The purpose of this document is to define a generalized method of 
    performing fragmentation for use with all PWE3 protocols and 
    services. This method should be utilized only in cases where MTU-
    management methods fail. Due to the increased processing overhead, 
    fragmentation and reassembly in core network devices should always 
    be considered something to avoid whenever possible.

              Figure 2: PWE3 Fragmentation/Reassembly Domain 
     
     
    Fragmentation takes place in the transmitting PE immediately prior 
    to PW encapsulation, and reassembly takes place in the receiving PE 
    immediately after PW decapsulation. 
     
    Since a sequence number is necessary for the fragmentation and 
    reassembly procedures, using the Sequence Number field on 
    fragmented packets is REQUIRED (see sections 4.1 and 5.5 for the 
    location of the Sequence Number fields for MPLS and L2TPv3 
    encapsulations respectively).  The order of operation is that first 
    fragmentation is performed, and then the resulting fragments are 
    assigned sequential sequence numbers. 
     
    Depending on the specific PWE3 encapsulation in use, the value 0 
    may not be a part of the sequence number space, in which case its 
    use for fragmentation must follow this same rule - as the sequence 
    number is incremented, it skips zero and wraps from 65535 to 1.  
    Conversely, if the value 0 is part of the sequence space, then the 
    same sequence space is also used for fragmentation and reassembly.

 3. Alternatives to PWE3 Fragmentation/Reassembly 
     
    Fragmentation and reassembly in network equipment generally 
    requires significantly greater resources than sending a packet as a 
    single unit. As such, fragmentation and reassembly should be 
    avoided whenever possible. Ideal solutions for avoiding 
    fragmentation include proper configuration and management of MTU 
    sizes between the Customer Edge (CE) router, Provider Edge (PE) 
    router, and across the PSN, as well as adaptive measures which 
    operate with the originating host [e.g. [PATHMTU], [PATHMTUv6]] to 
    reduce the packet sizes at the source. 
     
    A PE's native service processing (NSP) MAY choose to fragment a 
    packet before allowing it to enter a PW. For example, if an IP 
    packet arrives from a CE with an MTU which will yield a PW packet 
    which is greater than the PSN MTU, the PE NSP may perform IP 
    fragmentation on the packet, also replicating the L2 header for the 
    IP fragments. This effectively creates two (or more) packets, each 
    carrying an IP fragment preceded by an L2 header, for transport 
    individually across the PW. The receiving PE is unaware that the 
    originating host did not perform the IP fragmentation, and as such 
    does not treat the PW packets in any special way. This ultimately 
    has the affect of placing the burden of fragmentation on the PE 
    NSP, and reassembly on the IP destination host. 
     
     
 4. PWE3 Fragmentation With MPLS 
     
    When using the signaling procedures in [MPLS-Control], there is a 
    Pseudowire Interface Parameter Sub-TLV type used to signal the use 
    of fragmentation when advertising a VC label[IANA]: 
     
       Parameter      Length    Description 
            0x09           2    Fragmentation indicator 
     
    The presence of this parameter in the VC FEC element indicates that 
    the receiver is able to reassemble fragments when the control word 
    is in use for the VC label being advertised.  It does not obligate 
    the sender to use fragmentation; it is simply an indication that 
    the sender MAY use fragmentation.  The sender MUST NOT use 
    fragmentation if this parameter is not present in the VC FEC 
    element. 
     
    If [MPLS-Control] signaling is not in use, then whether or not to 
    use fragmentation MUST be configured in the sender.

 4.1 Fragment Bit Locations For MPLS 
     
    MPLS-based PWE3 uses the following control word format [Control-
    Word], with the B and E fragmentation bits identified in position 8 
    and 9:  
     
     
      0                   1                   2                   3

    The B and E bits are defined as follows:

    -- 
    00 indicates that the entire (un-fragmented) payload is carried 
       in a single packet  
    01 indicates the packet carrying the first fragment 
    10 indicates the packet carrying the last fragment  
    11 indicates a packet carrying an intermediate fragment 
     
    See Appendix A for a discussion of the derivation of these values 
    for the B and E bits. 
     
    See section 2 for the description of the use of the Sequence Number 
    field. 
  
 4.2 Other Considerations 
     
    Path MTU [PATHMTU] [PATHMTUv6] may be used to dynamically determine 
    the maximum size for fragments. The application of path MTU to MPLS 
    is discussed in [LABELSTACK]. The maximum size of the fragments may 
    also be configured. The signaled Interface MTU parameter in [MPLS-
    Control] SHOULD be used to set the maximum size of the reassembly 
    buffer for received packets to make optimal use of reassembly 
    buffer resources. 
     
     
 5. PWE3 Fragmentation With L2TP 
  
    This section defines the location of the B and E bits for L2TPv3 
    [L2TPv3] and L2TPv2 [L2TPv2] headers, as well as the signaling 
    mechanism for advertising MRU (Maximum Receive Unit) values and 
    support for fragmentation on a given PW. As IP is the most common

    PSN used with L2TP, IP PSN fragmentation and reassembly is 
    discussed as well. 
     
 5.1 PW-specific Fragmentation vs. IP fragmentation 
     
    When proper MTU management across a network fails, IP PSN 
    fragmentation and reassembly may be used to accommodate MTU 
    mismatches between tunnel endpoints. If the overall traffic 
    requiring fragmentation and reassembly is very light, or there are 
    sufficient optimized mechanisms for IP PSN fragmentation and 
    reassembly available, IP PSN fragmentation and reassembly may be 
    sufficient. 
     
    When facing a large number of PW packets requiring fragmentation 
    and reassembly, a PW-specific method has properties that 
    potentially allow for more resource-friendly implementations. 
    Specifically, the ability to assign buffer usage on a per-PW basis 
    and PW sequencing may be utilized to gain advantage over a general 
    mechanism applying to all IP packets across all PWs. Further, PW 
    fragmentation may be more easily enabled in a selective manner for 
    some or all PWs, rather than enabling reassembly for all IP traffic 
    arriving at a given node. 
     
    Deployments SHOULD avoid a situation which uses a combination of IP 
    PSN and PW fragmentation and reassembly on the same node. Such 
    operation clearly defeats the purpose behind the mechanism defined 
    in this document. This is especially important for L2TPv3 
    pseudowires, since potentially fragmentation can take place in 
    three different places (the IP PSN, the PW, and the encapsulated 
    payload). Care must be taken to ensure that the MTU/MRU values are 
    set and advertised properly at each tunnel endpoint to avoid this. 
    When fragmentation is enabled within a given PW, the DF bit MUST be 
    set on all L2TP over IP packets for that PW.  
     
    L2TPv3 nodes SHOULD participate in Path MTU [PATHMTU], [PATHMTUv6] 
    for automatic adjustment of the PSN MTU. When the payload is IP, 
    Path MTU should be used at they payload level as well. 
     
 5.2 Advertising Reassembly Support in L2TP 
     
    The constructs defined in this section for advertising 
    fragmentation support in L2TP are applicable to [L2TPv3] and 
    [L2TPv2]. 
     
    This document defines two new AVPs to advertise maximum receive 
    unit values and reassembly support. These AVPs MAY be present in 
    the ICRQ, ICRP, ICCN, OCRQ, OCRP, OCCN, or SLI messages. The most 
    recent value received always takes precedence over a previous 
    value, and MUST be dynamic over the life of the session if received

    via the SLI message. One of the two new AVPs (MRRU) is used to 
    advertise that PWE3 reassembly is supported by the sender of the 
    AVP. Reassembly support MAY be unidirectional.

    MRU (Maximum Receive Unit), attribute number TBD1, is the maximum 
    size in octets of a fragmented or complete PW frame, including L2TP 
    encapsulation, receivable by the side of the PW advertising this 
    value. The advertised MRU does NOT include the PSN header (i.e. the 
    IP and/or UDP header). This AVP does not imply that PWE3

    MRRU (Maximum Reassembled Receive Unit AVP), attribute number TBD2, 
    is the maximum size in octets of a reassembled frame, including any 
    PW framing, but not including the L2TP encapsulation or L2-specific 
    sublayer. Presence of this AVP signifies the ability to receive PW 
    fragments and reassemble them. Packet fragments MUST NOT be sent by 
    a peer which has not received this AVP in a control message. If the 
    MRRU is present in a message, the MRU AVP MUST be present as well. 
      
    The MRRU SHOULD be used to set the maximum size of the reassembly 
    buffer for received packets to make optimal use of reassembly 
    buffer resources. 
     
    This AVP MAY be hidden (the H bit MAY be 0 or 1). The mandatory (M) 
    bit for this AVP SHOULD be set to 0. The Length (before hiding) is 
    8. The Vendor ID is the IETF Vendor ID of 0.

 5.5 Fragment Bit Locations For L2TPv3 Encapsulation 
     
    The usage of the B and E bits is described in Section 4.1. For 
    L2TPv3 encapsulation, the B and E bits are defined as bits 2 and 3 
    in the leading bits of the Default L2-Specific Sublayer (see 
    Section 7).

    The S (Sequence) bit is as defined in [L2TPv3]. Location of the B 
    and E bits for PW-Types which use a variant L2 specific sublayer 
    are outside the scope of this document.  
     
    When fragmentation is used, an L2-Specific Sublayer with B and E 
    bits defined MUST be present in all data packets for a given 
    session. The presence and format of the L2-Specific Sublayer is 
    advertised via the L2-Specific Sublayer AVP, Attribute Type 69, 
    defined in section 5.4.4 of [L2TPv3]. 
     
    See section 2 for the description of the use of the Sequence Number 
    field. 
  
 5.6 Fragment Bit Locations for L2TPv2 Encapsulation 
     
    The usage of the B and E bits is described in Section 4.1. For 
    L2TPv2 encapsulation, the B and E bits are defined as bits 8 and 9 
    in the leading bits of the L2TPv2 header as depicted below (see 
    Section 7).

 6. Security Considerations  
      
    As with any additional protocol construct, each level of complexity 
    adds the potential to exploit protocol and implementation errors.

                   PWE3 Fragmentation and Reassembly     November 2005 
                                                              
  
    Implementers should be especially careful of not tying up an 
    abundance of resources, even for the most pathological combination 
    of packet fragments that could be received. Beyond these issues of 
    general implementation quality, there are no known notable security 
    issues with using the mechanism defined in this document.  It 
    should be pointed out that RFC 1990, on which this document is 
    based, and its derivatives have been widely implemented and 
    extensively used in the Internet and elsewhere. 
     
    [IPFRAG-SEC] and [TINYFRAG] describe potential network attacks 
    associated with IP fragmentation and reassembly. The issues 
    described in these documents attempt to bypass IP access controls 
    by sending various carefully formed "tiny fragments", or by 
    exploiting the IP offset field to cause fragments to overlap and 
    rewrite interesting portions of an IP packet after access checks 
    have been performed. The latter is not an issue with the PW-
    specific fragmentation method described in this document as there 
    is no offset field; However, implementations MUST be sure to not 
    allow more than one whole fragment to overwrite another in a 
    reconstructed frame. The former may be a concern if packet 
    filtering and access controls are being placed on tunneled frames 
    within the PW encapsulation. To circumvent any possible attacks in 
    either case, all filtering and access controls should be applied to 
    the resulting reconstructed frame rather than any PW fragments. 
     
     
 7. IANA Considerations 
  
    This document does not define any new registries for IANA to 
    maintain. 
     
    Note that [IANA] has already allocated the Fragmentation Indicator 
    interface parameter, so no further IANA action is required. 
  
    This document requires IANA to assign new values for registries 
    already managed by IANA (see Sections 7.1 and 7.2), and two 
    reserved bits in an existing header (see Section 7.3). 
     
 7.1 Control Message Attribute Value Pairs (AVPs) 
     
    Two additional AVP Attributes are specified in Section 5.3 and 
    Section 5.4. They are required to be defined by IANA as described 
    in Section 2.2 of [BCP0068].

 7.2 Default L2-Specific Sublayer bits 
     
    This registry was created as part of the publication of [L2TPv3]. 
    This document defines two reserved bits in the Default L2-Specific 
    Sublayer in Section 5.5, which may be assigned by IETF Consensus 
    [RFC2434]. They are required to be assigned by IANA.

 7.3 Leading Bits of the L2TPv2 Message Header 
     
    This document requires definition of two reserved bits in the 
    L2TPv2 [L2TPv2] header. Locations are noted by the "B" and "E" bits 
    in section 5.6.

 13. Appendix A: Relationship Between This Document and RFC 1990 
         
    The fragmentation of large packets into smaller units for 
    transmission is not new.  One fragmentation and reassembly method 
    was defined in RFC 1990, Multi-Link PPP [MLPPP].  This method was 
    also adopted for both Frame Relay [FRF.12] and ATM [FAST] network 
    technology.  This document adopts the RFC 1990 fragmentation and 
    reassembly procedures as well, with some distinct modifications 
    described in this appendix.  Familiarity with RFC 1990 is assumed. 
  
    RFC 1990 was designed for use in environments where packet 
    fragments may arrive out of order due to their transmission on 
    multiple parallel links, specifying that buffering be used to place 
    the fragments in correct order.  For PWE3, the ability to reorder 
    fragments prior to reassembly is OPTIONAL; receivers MAY choose to

                   PWE3 Fragmentation and Reassembly     November 2005 
                                                              
  
    drop frames when a lost fragment is detected. Thus, when the 
    sequence number on received fragments shows that a fragment has 
    been skipped, the partially reassembled packet MAY be dropped, or 
    the receiver MAY wish to wait for the fragment to arrive out of 
    order.  In the latter case, a reassembly timer MUST be used to 
    avoid locking up buffer resources for too long a period. 
     
    Dropping out-of-order fragments on a given PW can provide a 
    considerable scalability advantage for network equipment performing 
    reassembly. If out-of-order fragments are a relatively rare event 
    on a given PW, throughput should not be adversely affected by this. 
    Note, however, if there are cases where fragments of a given frame 
    are received out-or-order in a consistent manner (e.g. a short 
    fragment is always switched ahead of a larger fragment) then 
    dropping out-of-order fragments will cause the fragmented frame to 
    never be received. This condition may result in an effective denial 
    of service to a higher-lever application. As such, implementations 
    fragmenting a PW frame MUST at the very least ensure that all 
    fragments are sent in order from their own egress point. 
     
    An implementation may also choose to allow reassembly of a limited 
    number of fragmented frames on a given PW, or across a set of PWs 
    with reassembly enabled. This allows for a more even distribution 
    of reassembly resources, reducing the chance of a single or small 
    set of PWs exhausting all reassembly resources for a node. As with 
    dropping out-of-order fragments, there are perceivable cases where 
    this may also provide an effective denial of service. For example, 
    if fragments of multiple frames are consistently received before 
    each frame can be reconstructed in a set of limited PW reassembly 
    buffers, then a set of these fragmented frames will never be 
    delivered. 
     
    RFC 1990 headers use two bits which indicate the first and last 
    fragments in a frame, and a sequence number.  The sequence number 
    may be either 12 or 24 bits in length (from [MLPPP]): 
     
                     0             7 8            15

    PWE3 fragmentation takes advantage of existing PW sequence numbers 
    and control bit fields wherever possible, rather than defining a 
    separate header exclusively for the use of fragmentation.  Thus, it 
    uses neither of the RFC 1990 sequence number formats described 
    above, relying instead on the sequence number that already exists 
    in the PWE3 header. 
     
    RFC 1990 defines a two one-bit fields, a (B)eginning fragment bit 
    and an (E)nding fragment bit. The B bit is set to 1 on the first 
    fragment derived from a PPP packet and set to 0 for all other 
    fragments from the same PPP packet. The E bit is set to 1 on the 
    last fragment and set to 0 for all other fragments.  A complete 
    unfragmented frame has both the B and E bits set to 1.  
     
    PWE3 fragmentation inverts the value of the B and E bits, while 
    retaining the operational concept of marking the beginning and 
    ending of a fragmented frame. Thus, for PW the B bit is set to 0 on 
    the first fragment derived from a PW frame and set to 1 for all 
    other fragments derived from the same frame. The E bit is set to 0 
    on the last fragment and set to 1 for all other fragments.  A 
    complete unfragmented frame has both the B and E bits set to 0. The 
    motivation behind this value inversion for the B and E bits is to 
    allow complete frames (and particularly, implementations that only 
    support complete frames) to simply leave the B and E bits in the 
    header set 0. 
     
    In order to support fragmentation, the B and E bits MUST be defined 
    or identified for all PWE3 tunneling protocols. Sections 4 and 5 
    define these locations for PWE3 MPLS [Control-Word], L2TPv2 
    [L2TPv2], and L2TPv3 [L2TPv3] tunneling protocols.
