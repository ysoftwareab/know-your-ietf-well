                       Transport of CoAP over SMS
                   draft-becker-core-coap-sms-gprs-06

Abstract

   Short Message Service (SMS) of mobile cellular networks is frequently
   used in Machine-To-Machine (M2M) communications, such as for
   telematic devices.  The service offers small packet sizes and high
   delays just as other typical low-power and lossy networks (LLNs),
   i.e. 6LoWPANs.  The design of the Constrained Application Protocol
   (CoAP, RFC7252), that took the limitations of LLNs into account, is
   thus also applicable to other transports.  The adaptation of CoAP to
   SMS transport mechanisms is described in this document.

Internet-Draft                CoAP over SMS                February 2017


1.  Introduction

   This specification details the usage of the Constrained Application
   Protocol on the Short Message Service (SMS) of mobile cellular
   networks.

1.1.  Motivation

   In some M2M environments, internet connectivity is not supported by
   the constrained end-points, but a cellular network connection is
   supported instead.  Internet connectivity might also be switched off
   for power saving reasons or the cellular coverage does not allow for
   Internet connectivity.  In these situations, SMS will be supported,
   instead of UDP/IP over General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), High
   Speed Packet Access (HSPA) or Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks.

   In 3GPP, SMS is identified as the transport protocol for small data
   transmissions (See [ts23_888] for Key Issue on Machine Type
   Communication (MTC) Device Trigger and the proposed solutions in
   Sections 6.2, 6.42, 6.44, 6.48, 6.52, 6.60, and 6.61).  In [ts23_682]
   'Architecture Enhancements to facilitate communications with Packet
   Data Networks and Applications' SMS is at the moment the only Trigger
   Delivery (Trigger Delivery using T4).

   M2M protocols using SMS, e.g. for telematics, are using mostly
   various diverse proprietary and closed binary protocols with limited
   publicly available documentation at the moment.

   In Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) LightweightM2M technical specification
   [oma_lightweightm2m_ts], SMS is identified as an alternative
   transport for CoAP messages.

1.2.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terminology:

   CoAP Server and Client
      The terms CoAP Server and CoAP Client are used synonymously to
      Server and Client as specified in the terminology section of
      [RFC7252].

   Mobile Station (MS)
      A Mobile Station includes all required user equipment and software
      that is needed for communication with a mobile network.  As
      defined in [etsi_ts101_748].

1.3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Scenarios

   Several scenarios are presented first for M2M communications with
   CoAP over SMS.  First Mobile-Originating Mobile-Terminating (MO-MT)
   scenarios are presented, where both CoAP endpoints are in devices in
   a cellular network.  Next, Mobile-Terminating (MT) scenarios are
   detailed, where only the CoAP server is in a cellular network.
   Finally, Mobile-Originating (MO) scenarios where the CoAP client is
   in the cellular network.

2.1.  MO-MT Scenarios

   Two mobile cellular terminals communicate by exchanging a CoAP
   Request and Response embedded into short message protocol data units
   (PDUs) (depicted in Figure 1).  Both terminals are connected via a
   Short Message Service Centre (SMS-C).

                       CoAP-REQ            CoAP-REQ
              +------+   (SMS)   +-------+   (SMS)  +------+

      Figure 1: Cellular and Cellular Communication (only SMS-based)

2.2.  MT Scenarios

   An IP host and a mobile cellular terminal communicate by exchanging
   CoAP Request and Response.  The IP host uses protocols offered by the
   SMS-C (e.g.  Short Message Peer-to-Peer (SMPP [smpp]), Computer
   Interface to Message Distribution (CIMD [cimd]), Universal Computer
   Protocol/External Machine Interface (UCP/EMI [ucp])) to submit a
   short message for delivery, which contains the CoAP Request (depicted
   in Figure 2).

   There are service providers that offer SMS delivery and notification
   using an HTTP/REST interface (depicted in Figure 3).

2.3.  MO Scenarios

   A mobile cellular terminal and an IP host communicate by exchanging
   CoAP Request and Response.  The mobile cellular terminal sends a CoAP
   Request in a short message, which is in turn forwarded by the SMS-C
   (e.g. with Short Message Peer-to-Peer (SMPP [smpp]), Computer
   Interface to Message Distribution (CIMD [cimd]), Universal Computer
   Protocol/External Machine Interface (UCP/EMI [ucp])) as depicted in
   Figure 4).  This scenario can be a fall-back for mobile-originating
   communication, when IP connectivity cannot be setup (e.g. due to
   missing coverage).

3.  Message Exchanges

3.1.  Message Exchange for SMS in a Cellular-To-Cellular Mobile-
      Originated and Mobile-Terminated Scenario

   The CoAP Client works as a Mobile Station to send the short message,
   and the CoAP Server works as another Mobile Station to receive the
   short message.  All short messages are stored and forwarded by the
   Service Center.  The message exchange between the CoAP Client and the
   CoAP Server is depicted in the figure below:

    MS/CoAP CLIENT        Service Center          MS/CoAP SERVER
        |                       |                        |
        |   ---SMS-SUBMIT--->   |                        |
        | <-SMS-SUBMIT-REPORT-- |                        |
        |                       |                        |
        |                       |    --SMS-DELIVER--->   |
        |                       | <-SMS-DELIVER-REPORT-- |
        |                       |                        |
        | <-SMS-STATUS-REPORT-- |                        |
        |                       |                        |


                     Figure 6: CoAP Messages over SMS

   Note that the message exchange is just for one request message from
   CoAP Client and CoAP Server.  It includes the following steps:

   Step 1: The CoAP Client sends a CoAP request in a SMS-SUBMIT message
   to the Service Center.  The CoAP Server address is specified as TP-
   Destination-Address (see [ts23_040]).

   Step 2: The Service Center returns a SMS-SUBMIT-REPORT message to the
   CoAP Client.

   Step 3: The Service Center stores the received SMS message and
   forwards it to the CoAP Server, using an SMS-DELIVER message.  The

Internet-Draft                CoAP over SMS                February 2017


   CoAP Client address is specified as a TP Originating Address (see
   [ts23_040]).

   Step 4: The CoAP Server returns an SMS-DELIVER-REPORT message to the
   Service Center.

   Step 5: The Service Center returns the SMS-STATUS-REPORT message to
   the CoAP Client to indicate the SMS delivery status, if required by
   the CoAP Client.

   Note that the SMS-STATUS-REPORT message just indicates the transport
   layer SMS delivery status and has no relationship with the
   confirmable message or non-confirmable message.  If the CoAP Client
   has sent a confirmable message, the CoAP Server MUST use a separate
   SMS message to transmit the ACK.

4.  Encoding Schemes of CoAP for SMS transport

   Short messages can be encoded by using various alphabets: GSM 7 bit
   default alphabet ([ts23_038]), 8 bit data alphabet, and 16 bit UCS2
   data alphabet ([iso_ucs2]).  These encodings lead to message sizes of
   160, 140, and 70 characters, respectively.  Whereas the support of 7
   bit encoding is mandatory on a MS, the two other encodings are
   dependent on the language that needs to be encoded, e.g.  UCS2 for
   Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, etc.  Furthermore, the supported encoding
   highly depends on the implementations of the MS itself.

   According to [ts23_038], GSM 7 bit encoding shall be supported by all
   MSs offering SMS services.  Since not all MSs support 8 bit short
   message encoding, the preferred encoding scheme for CoAP messages
   over SMS is therefore 7 bit, e.g.  Base64 ([RFC4648]) or SMS encoding
   in Appendix A.1.

   More considerations about SMS encoding can be found in Appendix A.

5.  Message Size Implementation Considerations

   By using 7 bit encoding, a maximum length of 160 characters is
   allowed in one short message [ts23_038].  Consequently, the maximum
   length for a CoAP message results in 140 bytes. 160 characters = (140
   bytes * 8)/7.

   Possible options for larger CoAP messages are:

   Concatenated short messages
      Most MSs are able to send concatenation short messages in order to
      transmit longer messages.  The total length of a concatenated
      short message can consist of up to 255 single messages and result



Kuladinithi, et al.      Expires August 24, 2017                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                CoAP over SMS                February 2017


      in total length of 39015 7 bit characters or 34170 bytes.
      Resulting from this, the maximum length of each individual message
      reduces to 153 (160 - 7) characters (133 bytes).

   CoAP block-wise transfer
      According to [RFC7959], the Block Size (SZX) of block-wise
      transfer in CoAP is represented as a three-bit unsigned integer.
      Thus, the possible block sizes are to the power of two.  (Block
      size = 2**(SZX + 4)).  Due to the limitations of 160 characters
      (140 bytes) for one short message, the maximum value of SZX is 3
      (Block size = 128 byte).

   However, it is RECOMMENDED that SMS is not used to transfer very
   large resource data using block-wise transfer.

6.  Addressing

   For SMS in cellular networks, the CoAP endpoints have to work with a
   SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) card and have to be addressed by the
   MSISDN (Mobile Station ISDN (MSISDN) number).

   To allow the CoAP client to detect that the short message contains a
   CoAP message, the TP-DATA-Coding-Scheme SHOULD be included.

7.  Options

7.1.  New Options for mixed IP operation.

   In case a CoAP Server has more than one network interface, e.g.  SMS
   and IP, the CoAP Client might want the server to send the response
   via an alternative transport, i.e. to it's alternative address.
   However, that implies that the initiating CoAP Client is aware of the
   presence of the alternative interface.  For this reason the new
   options Response-To-Uri-Host and Response-To-Uri-Port are proposed.

   +-----+---+---+---+---+-----------------+--------+--------+---------+
   | No. | C | U | N | R |       Name      | Format | Length | Default |
   +-----+---+---+---+---+-----------------+--------+--------+---------+
   | TBD |   |   |   |   |   Response-To-  | string | 1-270  |  (none) |
   |     |   |   |   |   |     Uri-Host    |        |   B    |         |
   | TBD |   |   |   |   |   Response-To-  |  uint  | 0-2 B  |   5683  |
   |     |   |   |   |   |     Uri-Port    |        |        |         |
   +-----+---+---+---+---+-----------------+--------+--------+---------+

Internet-Draft                CoAP over SMS                February 2017


   If the Response-To-Uri-Host is present in the request, server MUST
   send the response to the indicated URI address, instead of the
   client's original request URI.

   The options SHOULD NOT be used in the response.

   The options MUST NOT occur more than once.

8.  URI Scheme

   The coap:// scheme defines that a CoAP server is reachable over UDP/
   IP.  Hence, a new URI scheme is needed for CoAP servers which are
   reachable over SMS.

   As proposed in [I-D.silverajan-core-coap-alternative-transports], the
   transport information is expressed as part of the URI scheme
   component.  This is performed by minting new schemes for SMS
   transport using the form "coap+sms", where the name of the transport
   is clearly and unambiguously described.  The endpoint identifier,
   path and query components together with each scheme name would be
   used to uniquely identify each resource.

   Example of such URI :

   o  coap+sms://0015105550101/sensors/temperature

   In the URI, 0015105550101 is a telephone subscriber number.

9.  Transmission Parameters

   It is RECOMMENDED to configure the RESPONSE_TIMEOUT variable for a
   higher duration than specified in [RFC7252] for the applications
   described here.  The actual value SHOULD be chosen based on
   experience with SMS.

10.  Multicast

   Multicast is not possible with SMS transports.

11.  Security Considerations

   It is possible that a malicious CoAP Client sends repeated requests,
   and it may cost money for the CoAP Server to use SMS to send back
   associated responses.  To avoid this situation, the CoAP Server
   implementation can authenticate the CoAP Client before responding to
   the requests.  For example, the CoAP Server can maintain an MSISDN
   white list.  Only the MSISDN specified in the white list will be

   allowed to send requests.  The requests from others will be ignored
   or rejected.

12.  IANA Considerations

12.1.  CoAP Option Number

   The IANA is requested to add the following option number entries to
   the CoAP Option Number Registry:

      +--------+----------------------+----------------------------+
      | Number |       Name           | Reference                  |
      +--------+----------------------+----------------------------+
      |  TBD   | Response-To-Uri-Host | Section 2 of this document |
      +--------+----------------------+----------------------------+
      |  TBD   | Response-To-Uri-Port | Section 2 of this document |
      +--------+----------------------+----------------------------+

12.2.  URI Scheme Registration

   According to [I-D.silverajan-core-coap-alternative-transports] this
   document requests the registration of the Uniform Resource Identifier
   (URI) scheme "coap+sms".  The registration request complies with
   [RFC7595].

Appendix A.  SMS encoding

   For use in SMS applications, CoAP messages can be transferred using
   SMS binary mode.  However, there is operational experience showing
   that some environments cannot successfully send a binary mode SMS.

   For transferring SMS in character mode (7-bit characters),
   base64-encoding [RFC4648] is an obvious choice.  3 bytes of message
   (24 bits) turn into 4 characters, which consume 28 bits.  The overall
   overhead is approximately 17 %; the maximum message size is 120 bytes
   (160 SMS characters).

   If a more compact encoding is desired, base85 encoding could be
   employed (however, probably not the version defined in [RFC1924] --
   instead, the version used in tools such as btoa and PDF should be
   chosen).  However, this requires division operations.  Also, the
   base85 character set includes several characters that cannot be
   transferred in a single 7-bit unit in SMS and/or are known to cause
   operational problems.  A modified base85 character set can be defined
   to solve the latter problem.  4 bytes of message (32 bits) turn into
   5 characters, which consume 35 bits.  The overall overhead is
   approximately 9.3 %; the resulting maximum message size is 128 bytes
   (160 SMS characters).

   Base64 and base85 do not make use of the fact that much CoAP data
   will be ASCII-based.  Therefore, we define the following ASCII-
   optimized SMS encoding.

A.1.  ASCII-optimized SMS encoding

   Not all 128 theoretically possible SMS characters are operationally
   free of problems.  We therefore define:




Kuladinithi, et al.      Expires August 24, 2017               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                CoAP over SMS                February 2017


   Shunned code characters:  @ sign, as it maps to 0x00

      LF and CR signs (0x0A, 0x0D)

      uppercase C cedilla (0x09), as it is often mistranslated in
      gateways

      ESC (0x1B), as it is used in certain character combinations only

   Some ASCII characters cannot be transferred in the base SMS character
   set, as their code positions are taken by non-ASCII characters.
   These are simply encoded with their ASCII code positions, e.g., an
   underscore becomes a section mark (even though underscore has a
   different code position in the SMS character set).

   Equivalently translated input bytes:  $, @, [, \, ], ^, _, `, {, |,
      }, ~, DEL

   In other words, bytes 0x20 to 0x7F are encoded into the same code
   positions in the 7-bit character set.

   Out of the remaining code characters, the following SMS characters
   are available for encoding:

   Non-equivalently translated (NET) code characters:  0x01 to 0x08, (8
      characters)

      0x0B, 0x0C, (2 characters)

      0x0E to 0x1A, (13 characters)

      0x1C to 0x1F, (4 characters)

   Of the 27 NET code characters, 18 are taken as prefix characters (see
   below), and 8 are defined as directly translated characters:

   Directly translated bytes:  Equivalently translated input bytes are
      represented as themselves

      0x00 to 0x07 are represented as 0x01 to 0x08

   This leaves 0x08 to 0x1F and 0x80 to 0xFF.  Of these, the bytes 0x80
   to 0x87 and 0xA0 to 0xFF are represented as the bytes 0x00 to 0x07
   (represented by characters 0x01 to 0x08) and 0x20 to 0x7F, with a
   prefix of 1 (see below).  The characters 0x08 to 0x1F are represented
   as the characters 0x28 to 0x3F with a prefix of 2 (see below).  The
   characters 0x88 to 0x9F are represented as the characters 0x48 to
   0x5F with a prefix of 2 (see below).  (Characters 0x01 to 0x08, 0x20

   to 0x27, 0x40 to 0x47, and 0x60 to 0x7f with a prefix of 2 are
   reserved for future extensions, which could be used for some
   backreferencing or run-length compression.)

   Bytes that do not need a prefix (directly translated bytes) are sent
   as is.  Any byte that does need a prefix (i.e., 1 or 2) is preceded
   by a prefix character, which provides a prefix for this and the
   following two bytes as follows:

                      +------+-----+---+------+-----+
                      | char | pfx | . | char | pfx |
                      +------+-----+---+------+-----+
                      | 0x0B | 100 | . | 0x15 | 200 |
                      | 0x0C | 101 | . | 0x16 | 201 |
                      | 0x0E | 102 | . | 0x17 | 202 |
                      | 0x0F | 110 | . | 0x18 | 210 |
                      | 0x10 | 111 | . | 0x19 | 211 |
                      | 0x11 | 112 | . | 0x1A | 212 |
                      | 0x12 | 120 | . | 0x1C | 220 |
                      | 0x13 | 121 | . | 0x1D | 221 |
                      | 0x14 | 122 | . | 0x1E | 222 |
                      +------+-----+---+------+-----+

                 Table 2: SMS prefix character assignment

   (This leaves one non-shunned character, 0x1F, for future extension.)

   The coding overhead of this encoding for random bytes is similar to
   Base85, without the need for a division/multiplication.  For bytes
   that are mostly ASCII characters, the overhead can easily become
   negative.  (Conversely, for bytes that for some reason are more
   likely to be non-ASCII than in a random sequence of bytes, the
   overhead becomes greater.)

   So, for instance, for the CoAP message in Figure 7:

   The 116 byte unencoded message is shown as ASCII characters in

       Figure 8: CoAP response message shown as unencoded characters

   The only non-ASCII characters in this example are in the beginning of
   the message.  According to the translation instructions above, the
   four bytes:

   89 11 (  A7

   need the prefixes:

   2  2  0  1

   As each prefix character always covers three unencoded bytes, we need
   the prefix characters for 220 and 100, which are \x1C and \x0B,
   respectively (Table 2).

   The equivalent SMS encoding is shown as equivalent-coded SMS
   characters in Figure 9 (7 bits per character, \x1C is the 220 prefix
   and \x0B is the 100 prefix, the rest is shown in equivalent
   encoding), adding two characters of prefix overhead, for a total
   length of 118 7-bit characters or 104 (103.25 plus padding) bytes:
