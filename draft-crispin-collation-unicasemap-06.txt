Abstract

     This document describes "i;unicode-casemap", a simple
     case-insensitive collation for Unicode strings.  It provides
     equality, substring and ordering operations.


Introduction

     The "i;ascii-casemap" collation described in [COMPARATOR] is quite
     simple to implement and provides case-independent comparisons for the
     26 Latin alphabetics.  It is specified as the default and/or baseline
     comparator in some application protocols, e.g., [IMAP-SORT].

     However, the "i;ascii-casemap" collation does not produce
     satisfactory results with non-ASCII characters.  It is possible, with
     a modest extension, to provide a more sophisticated collation with
     greater multilingual applicability than "i;ascii-casemap".  This
     extension provides case-independent comparisons for a much greater
     number of characters.  It also collates characters with diacriticals
     with the non-diacritical character forms.

     This collation, "i;unicode-casemap", is intended to be an alternative
     to, and preferred over, "i;ascii-casemap".  It does not replace the
     "i;basic" collation described in [BASIC].


1. Unicode Casemap Collation Description

     The "i;unicode-casemap" collation is a simple collation which is
     case-insensitive in its treatment of characters.  It provides
     equality, substring and ordering operations.  The validity test
     operation returns "valid" for any input.

     This collation allows strings in arbitrary (and mixed) character
     sets, as long as the character set for each string is identified and
     it is possible to convert the string to Unicode.  Strings which have
     an unidentified character set and/or can not be converted to Unicode
     are not rejected, but are treated as binary.

     Each input string is prepared by converting it to a "titlecased
     canonicalized UTF-8" string according to the following steps, using
     using UnicodeData.txt ([UNICODE-DATA]):

        (1) A Unicode codepoint is obtained from the input string.

            (a) If the input string is in a known charset that can be
                converted to Unicode, a sequence in the string's charset
                is read and checked for validity according to the rules of
                that charset.  If the sequence is valid, it is converted
                to a Unicode codepoint.  Note that for input strings in
                UTF-8, the UTF-8 sequence must be valid according to the
                rules of [UTF-8]; e.g., overlong UTF-8 sequences are
                invalid.

            (b) If the input string is in an unknown charset, or an
                invalid sequence occurs in step (1)(a), conversion ceases.
                No further preparation is performed, and any partial
                preparation results are discarded.  The original string is
                used unchanged with the i;octet comparator.

        (2) The following steps, using UnicodeData.txt ([UNICODE-DATA]),
            are performed on the resulting codepoint from step (1)(a).

            (a) If the codepoint has a titlecase property in
                UnicodeData.txt (this is normally the same as the
                uppercase property), the codepoint is converted to the
                codepoints in the titlecase property.

            (b) If the resulting codepoint from (2)(a) has a decomposition
                property of any type in UnicodeData.txt, the codepoint is
                converted to the codepoints in the decomposition property.
                This step is recursively applied to each of the resulting
                codepoints until no more decomposition is possible
                (effectively Normalization Form KD).

            Example: codepoint U+01C4 (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER DZ WITH CARON)
            has a titlecase property of U+01C5 (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER D
            WITH SMALL LETTER Z WITH CARON).  Codepoint U+01C5 has a
            decomposition property of U+0044 (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER D)
            U+017E (LATIN SMALL LETTER Z WITH CARON).  U+017E has a
            decomposition property of U+007A (LATIN SMALL LETTER Z) U+030c
            (COMBINING CARON).  Neither U+0044, U+007A, nor U+030C have
            any decomposition properties.  Therefore, U+01C4 is converted
            to U+0044 U+007A U+030C by this step.

        (3) The resulting codepoint(s) from step (2) is/are appended, in
            UTF-8 format, to the "titledcased canonicalized UTF-8" string.

        (4) Repeat from step (1) until there is no more data in the input
            string.

     Following the above preparation process on each string, the equality,
     ordering and substring operations are as for i;octet.

     It is permitted to use an alternative implementation of the above
     preparation process if it produces the same results.  For example, it
     may be more convenient for an implementation to convert all input
     strings to a sequence of UTF-16 or UTF-32 values prior to performing
     any of the step (2) actions.  Similarly, if all input strings are (or
     are convertable to) Unicode, it may be possible to use UTF-32 as an
     alternative to UTF-8 in step (3).

        Note: UTF-16 is unsuitable as an alternative to UTF-8 in step (3),
        because UTF-16 surrogates will cause i;octet to collate codepoints
        U+E0000 through U+FFFF after non-BMP codepoints.

     This collation is not locale sensitive.  Consequently, care should be
     taken when using OS-supplied functions to implement this collation.
     Functions such as strcasecmp and toupper are sometimes locale
     sensitive and may inconsistently casemap letters.

     The i;unicode-casemap collation is well suited to use with many
     Internet protocols and computer languages.  Use with natural language
     is often inappropriate; even though the collation apparently supports
     languages such as Swahili and English, in real-world use it tends to
     mis-sort a number of types of string:

     o  people and place names containing scripts that are not collated
        according to "alphabetical order".
     o  words with characters that have diacriticals.  However,
        i;unicode-casemap generally does a better job than i;ascii-casemap
        for most (but not all) languages.  For example, German umlaut
        letters will sort correctly, but some Scandinavian letters will
        not.
     o  names such as "Lloyd" (which in Welsh sorts after "Lyon", unlike
        in English),
     o  strings containing other non-letter symbols; e.g., euro and pound
        sterling symbols, quotation marks other than '"', dashes/hyphens,
        etc.

3. Security Considerations

     The security considerations for [UTF-8], [STRINGPREP] and
     [UNICODE-SECURITY] apply and are normative to this specification.


4. IANA Considerations

     The i;unicode-casemap collation defined in section 2 should be added
     to the registry of collations defined in [COMPARATOR].

                           to Unicode and errors are corrected in Unicode
                           revisions.  As a result, it may be less stable
                           than might otherwise be implied by the
