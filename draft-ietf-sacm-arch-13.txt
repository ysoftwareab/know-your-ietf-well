Internet-Draft              SACM Architecture                  July 2021


1.  Introduction

   The purpose of this draft is to define an architectural approach for
   a SACM Domain, based on the spirit of use cases found in [RFC7632]
   and requirements found in [RFC8248].  This approach gains the most
   advantage by supporting a variety of collection systems, and intends
   to enable a cooperative ecosystem of tools from disparate sources
   with minimal operator configuration.

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119, BCP 14 [RFC2119].

2.  Terms and Definitions

   Assessment:  Defined in [RFC5209] as "the process of collecting
      posture for a set of capabilities on the endpoint (e.g., host-
      based firewall) such that the appropriate validators may evaluate
      the posture against compliance policy."

   Asset:  Is a system resource, as defined in [RFC4949], that may be
      composed of other assets.

      Examples of Assets include: Endpoints, Software, Guidance, or
      X.509 public key certificates.  An asset is not necessarily owned
      by an organization.

   Asset Management:  The IT process by which assets are provisioned,
      updated, maintained and deprecated.

   Attribute:  Is a data element, as defined in [RFC5209], that is
      atomic.

      In the context of SACM, attributes are "atomic" information
      elements and an equivalent to attribute-value-pairs.  Attributes
      can be components of Subjects.

   Capability:  A set of features that are available from a SACM
      Component.

      See also "capability" in [I-D.ietf-i2nsf-terminology].

   Collector:  A piece of software that acquires information about one
      or more target endpoints by conducting collection tasks.

Internet-Draft              SACM Architecture                  July 2021


      A collector can be distributed across multiple endpoints, e.g.
      across a target endpoint and a SACM component.  The separate parts
      of the collector can communicate with a specialized protocol, such
      as PA-TNC [RFC5792].  At least one part of a distributed collector
      has to take on the role of a provider of information by providing
      SACM interfaces to propagate capabilities and to provide SACM
      content in the form of collection results.

   Configuration:  A non-volatile subset of the endpoint attributes of a
      endpoint that is intended to be unaffected by a normal reboot-
      cycle.

      Configuration is a type of imperative guidance that is stored in
      files (files dedicated to contain configuration and/ or files that
      are software components), directly on block devices, or on
      specific hardware components that can be accessed via
      corresponding software components.  Modification of configuration
      can be conducted manually or automatically via management (plane)
      interfaces that support management protocols, such as SNMP or WMI.
      A change of configuration can occur during both run-time and down-
      time of an endpoint.  It is common practice to scheduled a change
      of configuration during or directly after the completion of a
      boot-cycle via corresponding software components located on the
      target endpoint itself.

   Consumer:  A SACM Role that requires a SACM Component to include SACM
      Functions enabling it to receive information from other SACM
      Components.

   Endpoint:  Defined in [RFC5209] as "any computing device that can be
      connected to a network."

      Additional Information - The [RFC5209] definition continues, "Such
      devices normally are associated with a particular link layer
      address before joining the network and potentially an IP address
      once on the network.  This includes: laptops, desktops, servers,
      cell phones, or any device that may have an IP address."

      To further clarify the [RFC5209] definition, an endpoint is any
      physical or virtual device that may have a network address.  Note
      that, network infrastructure devices (e.g. switches, routers,
      firewalls), which fit the definition, are also considered to be
      endpoints within this document.

      Physical endpoints are always composites that are composed of

      hardware components and software components.  Virtual endpoints
      are composed entirely of software components and rely on software
      components that provide functions equivalent to hardware
      components.

      The SACM architecture differentiates two essential categories of
      endpoints: Endpoints whose security posture is intended to be
      assessed (target endpoints) and endpoints that are specifically
      excluded from endpoint posture assessment (excluded endpoints).

      Based on the definition of an asset, an endpoint is a type of
      asset.

   Endpoint Attribute:  Is a discreet endpoint characteristic that is
      computably observable.

      Endpoint Attributes typically constitute Attributes that can be
      bundled into Subject (e.g. information about a specific network
      interface can be represented via a set of multiple AVP).

   Endpoint Characteristics:  The state, configuration and composition
      of the software components and (virtual) hardware components a
      target endpoint is composed of, including observable behavior,
      e.g. sys-calls, log-files, or PDU emission on a network.

      In SACM work-flows, (Target) Endpoint Characteristics are
      represented via Information Elements.

   Posture:  Defined in [RFC5209] as "configuration and/or status of
      hardware or software on an endpoint as it pertains to an
      organization's security policy."

      This term is used within the scope of SACM to represent the
      configuration and state information that is collected from a
      target endpoint in the form of endpoint attributes (e.g. software/
      hardware inventory, configuration settings, dynamically assigned
      addresses).  This information may constitute one or more posture
      attributes.

   Posture Attributes:  Defined in [RFC5209] as "attributes describing
      the configuration or status (posture) of a feature of the
      endpoint.  A Posture Attribute represents a single property of an
      observed state.  For example, a Posture Attribute might describe
      the version of the operating system installed on the system."

      Within this document this term represents a specific assertion

      about endpoint configuration or state (e.g. configuration setting,
      installed software, hardware) represented via endpoint attributes.
      The phrase "features of the endpoint" highlighted above refers to
      installed software or software components.

   Provider:  A provider is a SACM role assigned to a SACM component
      that provides role-specific functions to provide information to
      other SACM components.

   Repository:  A repository is a controller that contains functions to
      consume, store and provide information of a particular kind.

      Such information is typically data transported on the data plane,
      but potentially also data and metadata from the control and
      management plane.  A single repository may provide the functions
      of more than one specific repository type (i.e. configuration
      baseline repository, assessment results repository, etc.)

   Security Automation:  The process of which security alerts can be
      automated through the use of different components to monitor,
      analyze and assess endpoints and network traffic for the purposes
      of detecting misconfigurations, misbehaviors or threats.

      Security Automation is intended to identify target endpoints that
      cannot be trusted (see "trusted" in [RFC4949].  This goal is
      achieved by creating and processing evidence (assessment
      statements) that a target endpoint is not a trusted system
      [RFC4949].

   SIEM:  TBD

   SOAR:  TBD

   State:  A volatile set of endpoint attributes of a (target) endpoint
      that is affected by a reboot-cycle.

      Local state is created by the interaction of components with other
      components via the control plane, via processing data plane
      payload, or via the functional properties of local hardware and
      software components.  Dynamic configuration (e.g.  IP address
      distributed dynamically via an address distribution and management
      services, such as DHCP) is considered state that is the result of
      the interaction with another component (e.g. provided by a DHCP
      server with a specific configuration).

   Target Endpoint:  Is an endpoint that is under assessment at some
      point in, or region of, time.

Internet-Draft              SACM Architecture                  July 2021


      Every endpoint that is not specifically designated as an excluded
      endpoint is a target endpoint.  A target endpoint is not part of a
      SACM domain unless it contains a SACM component (e.g. a SACM
      component that publishes collection results coming from an
      internal collector).

      A target endpoint is similar to a device that is a Target of
      Evaluation (TOE) as defined in Common Criteria and as referenced
      by [RFC4949].

   Vulnerability Assessment:  An assessment specifically tailored to
      determining whether a set of endpoints is vulnerable according to
      the information contained in the vulnerability description
      information.

   Workflow:  A workflow is a modular composition of tasks that can
      contain loops, conditionals, multiple starting points and multiple
      endpoints.

      The most prominent workflow in SACM is the assessment workflow.

3.  Architectural Overview

   The generic approach proposed herein recognizes the need to obtain
   information from existing and future state collection systems, and
   makes every attempt to respect [RFC7632] and [RFC8248].  At the
   foundation of any architecture are entities, or components, that need
   to communicate.  They communicate by sharing information, where, in a
   given flow, one or more components are consumers of information and
   one or more components are providers of information.  Different roles
   within a cooperative ecosystem may act as both Producers and
   Consumers of SACM-relevant information.

                  Figure 1: Basic Architectural Structure

3.1.  Producer

   A Producer can be described as an abstraction that refers to an
   entity capable of sending SACM-relevant information to one or many
   Consumers.  In general, information (a "payload") is produced to a
   particular topic, subscribed to by one or more Consumers.  Producers
   need not be concerned about any specifics of the payload it is
   providing to a given topic.  A Producer may, for example, publish
   posture collection instructions to collector topics.

3.2.  Consumer

   A Consumer can be described as an abstraction that refers to an
   entity capable of receiving SACM-relevant information from one or
   many Producers.  A Consumer acts as a subscriber to a given topic (or
   set of topics), enabling it to receive event notifications when a
   Producer provides a payload to that topic or topics.  Consumers
   receive payloads and act upon them according to their capabilities.
   A Consumer may, for example, subscribe to a posture collection topic
   to receive and act upon, collection instructions.

3.3.  Integration Service

   The Integration Service acts as the broker between Producers and
   Consumers; acting as the destination for Producers to publish
   payloads, and as the source for Consumers subscribing to those
   payloads.

Internet-Draft              SACM Architecture                  July 2021


   SACM Components are intended to interact with other SACM Components.
   These interactions can be thought of, at the architectural level, as
   the combination of interfaces with their supported operations.  Each
   interaction will convey a classified payload of information.  This
   classification of payload information allows Consumers to subscribe
   to only the classifications to which they are capable of handling.
   The payload information should contain subdomain-specific
   characteristics and/or instructions.

3.4.  Payload/Message

   The payload (sometimes referred to as a "message" or "message
   payload") is the unit of data involved in any given interaction
   between two SACM components.  The payload MAY be used to convey the
   semantic meaning of the operation to be performed.  Protocols such as
   [RFC6120] achieves this meaning through XML namespace identification
   within a "<message/>" or "<iq/>" stanza.  Topic-centric protocols
   such as [MQTT] convey the meaning of payloads through topic naming
   techniques.  Both methods require connected components to verify
   message payloads according to their respective capabilities.

   With respect to the Integration Service, the payload is simply an
   array of bytes, so the data contained within it is not required to
   convey a specific format or meaning to the Integration Service.  The
   serialization of the payload combined with the payload categorization
   provides meaning within the SACM context.

3.5.  Payload Categorization

   Within the SACM ecosystem, categorization of payloads and their
   transport provide the context through which various capabilities are
   achieved.  Two types of payload categorization can be described.

3.5.1.  Topic-centric

   Topic-centric payload categorization allows for a broad spectrum of
   payloads by characterizing those payloads through the Integration
   Service topic.  In this categorization, the topic name becomes a
   label attached to the payload to which the Integration Service
   matches against known subscriptions.  The topic becomes the
   operational context for the payload.  Topic-centric categorization
   allows for any payload to be sent to any topic, but requires that
   SACM consumers parse the payloads to determine whether or not they
   have the capability to act on those payloads.

   When interacting using a topic-centric payload categorization, topic
   naming conventions SHOULD provide an adequate amount of information
   to be deterministic regarding the purpose of the interaction.  For



Montville & Munyan       Expires 10 January 2022               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft              SACM Architecture                  July 2021


   example, a topic named "/notification/collection/oval" would indicate
   that (a) the topic is a broadcast/notification (publish/subscribe)
   topic, (b) subscribers to this topic are performing a "collection"
   action, and (c) the payloads published to the topic are represented
   using the OVAL serialization format.

3.5.2.  Payload-centric

   Payload-centric categorization encapsulates the intent of an
   interaction within the message payload itself, using an identifying
   token, tag, or namespace identifier.  This method allows for the
   limitation of message types, and therefore increases the
   extensibility of message payloads.

   Payload-centric categorization allows for modularization and
   specification of extensions, and for plugin-based support of
   capabilities based the categorization.  XMPP is an example of
   utilization of payload-centric categorization, allowing only three
   distinct "stanzas" ("<message/>", "<presence/>", and "<iq/>"), using
   payloads defined by the various extension protocols maintained by the
   XMPP standards foundation.

3.6.  Capabilities

   SACM components interact with each other based on their capacity to
   perform specific actions.  In advertising its capabilities, a SACM
   component indicates its competence to understand message payloads,
   perform any payload translation or normalization, and act upon that
   message.  For example, an Orchestration component receives a message
   to initiate posture attribute collection.  The Orchestrator may then
   normalize those instructions to a particular collection system's
   serialization.  The normalized instructions are then published to the
   Integration Service, notifying the appropriate subscribers.

   Capabilities are described using Uniform Resource Names (URNs), which
   will be maintained and enhanced via IANA tables (IANA
   Considerations).  Using topic-centric categorization of message
   payloads, capability URNs SHOULD be associated with Integration
   Service topics to which publishers, subscribers, and service
   handlers, will interact.  Topic naming conventions are considered
   implementation details and are not considered for standardization.
   Given a payload-centric categorization of message payloads,
   capability URNs SHOULD be used as the identifying token, tag, or
   namespace in order to distinguish specific payloads.

Internet-Draft              SACM Architecture                  July 2021


3.7.  Interaction Categories

   Two categories of interactions SHOULD be supported by the Integration
   Service: broadcast and directed.  Broadcast interactions are
   asynchronous by default, and directed interactions may be invoked
   either synchronously or asynchronously.

3.7.1.  Broadcast

   A broadcast interaction, commonly referred to as publish/subscribe,
   allows for a wider distribution of a message payload.  When a payload
   is published to the Integration Service, all subscribers to that
   payload are alerted and may consume the message payload.  This
   category of interaction can also be described as a "unicast"
   interaction when only a single subscriber exists.  An example of a
   broadcast interaction could be to publish Linux OVAL objects to a
   posture collection topic.  Subscribing consumers receive the
   notification, and proceed to collect endpoint configuration posture
   based on the supplied message payload.

3.7.2.  Directed

   The intent of a directed interaction is to enable point-to-point
   communications between a producer and consumer, through the standard
   interfaces provided by the Integration Service.  The provider
   component indicates which consumer is intended to receive the
   payload, and the Integration Service routes the payload directly to
   that consumer.  Two "styles" of directed interaction exist, differing
   only by the response from the consumer.

3.7.2.1.  Synchronous

   Synchronous, request/response style interaction requires that the
   requesting component block and wait for the receiving component to
   respond, or to time out when that response is delayed past a given
   time threshold.  A synchronous interaction example may be querying a
   CMDB for posture attribute information in order to perform an
   evaluation.

3.7.2.2.  Asynchronous

   An asynchronous interaction involves the payload producer directing
   the message to a consumer, but not blocking or waiting for an
   immediate response.  This style of interaction allows the producer to
   continue on to other activities without the need to wait for
   responses.  This style is particularly useful when the interaction
   payload invokes a potentially long-running task, such as data
   collection, report generation, or policy evaluation.  The receiving

   component may reply later via callbacks or further interactions, but
   it is not mandatory.

4.  SACM Role-based Architecture

   Within the cooperative SACM ecosystem, a number of roles act in
   coordination to provide relevant policy/guidance, perform data
   collection, storage, evaluation, and support downstream analytics and
   reporting.

              Figure 2: Notional Role-based Architecture

   As shown in Figure 2, the SACM role-based architecture consists of
   some basic SACM Components communicating using an integration
   service.  The integration service is expected to maximally align with
   the requirements described in [RFC8248], which means that the
   integration service will support brokered (i.e. point-to-point) and
   proxied data exchange.

Internet-Draft              SACM Architecture                  July 2021


4.1.  Architectural Roles/Components

   This document suggests a variety of players in a cooperative
   ecosystem; known as SACM Components.  SACM Components may be composed
   of other SACM Components, and each SACM Component plays one, or more,
   of several roles relevant to the ecosystem.  Roles may act as
   providers of information, consumers of information, or both provider
   and consumer.  Figure 2 depicts a number of SACM components which are
   architecturally significant and therefore warrant discussion and
   clarification.  Each role depicted in Figure 2 represents the
   interface to the component(s) fulfilling that role, not necessarily
   any specific implementation.  For example, the "Repository" figure
   represents the interface to persistent storage, and not any
   particular persistent storage mechanism.

4.1.1.  Manager

   The Manager acts as the control plane for the SACM ecosystem; a sort
   of high level component capable of coordinating the actions,
   notifications, and events between components.  The manager controls
   the administrative interfaces with the various components of the
   ecosystem, acting as the central point to which all other components
   will register and advertise their capabilities.  It is the
   responsibility of the manager to control a component's access to the
   ecosystem, maintain an inventory of components attached to the
   ecosystem, and to initiate the various workflows involved in the
   collection and/or evaluation of posture attributes.

   The manager should maintain the master set of capabilities that can
   be supported within the ecosystem.  These are the various collection,
   evaluation, and persistence capabilities with which components may
   register.  The manager MAY be responsible for assigning topics for
   each of the capabilities that are supported, as registering
   components subsequently subscribe to, or configure service handlers
   for, those topics.

   The manager may act as the user interface to the ecosystem, providing
   user dashboards, inventories, component management, or operational
   controls within the boundary of responsibility.

4.1.2.  Orchestrator(s)

   Orchestration components provide the manager with resources for
   delegating work across the SACM ecosystem.  Orchestrators are
   responsible for receiving messages from the manager, e.g. posture
   attribute collection instructions, and routing those messages to the
   appropriate "actions".  For example, an orchestrator may support the
   capability of translating posture collection instructions using the



Montville & Munyan       Expires 10 January 2022               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft              SACM Architecture                  July 2021


   Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL) and providing those
   instructions to OVAL collectors.  An orchestrator may support the
   capability of initiating policy evaluation.  Where the Manager is
   configured to ask a particular set of questions, those questions are
   delegated to Orchestrators, who are then capable of asking those
   questions using specific dialects.

4.1.3.  Repositories

   Figure 2 only includes a single reference to "Repository(-ies)", but
   in practice, a number of separate data repositories may exist,
   including posture attribute repositories, policy repositories, local
   vulnerability definition data repositories, and state assessment
   results repositories.  The diagrammed notion of a repository within
   the SACM context represents an interface in which payloads are
   provided (based on the capabilities of the producer), normalized, and
   persisted.

   These data repositories may exist separately or together in a single
   representation, and the design of these repositories may be as
   distinct as their intended purpose, such as the use of relational
   database management systems (RDBMS), filesystem-based storage, or
   graph/map implementations.  Each implementation of a SACM repository
   should focus on the relationships between data elements and implement
   the SACM information and data model(s).

4.1.4.  Integration Service

   If each SACM component represents a set of capabilities, then the
   Integration Service represents the "fabric" by which SACM components
   are woven together.  The Integration Service acts as a message
   broker, combining a set of common message categories and
   infrastructure to allow SACM components to communicate using a shared
   set of interfaces.  The Integration Service's brokering capabilities
   enable the exchange of various information payloads, orchestration of
   component capabilities, message routing and reliable delivery.  The
   Integration Service minimizes the dependencies from one system to
   another through the loose coupling of applications through messaging.
   SACM components will "attach" to the Integration Service either
   through native support for the integration implementation, or through
   the use of "adapters" which provide a proxied attachment.

   The Integration Service should provide mechanisms for both
   synchronous and asynchronous request/response-style messaging, and a
   publish/subscribe mechanism to implement an event-based architecture.
   It is the responsibility of the Integration Service to coordinate and
   manage the sending and receiving of messages.  The Integration
   Service should allow components to directly connect and produce or



Montville & Munyan       Expires 10 January 2022               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft              SACM Architecture                  July 2021


   consume messages, or connect via message translators which can act as
   a proxy, transforming messages from a component format to one
   implementing a SACM data model.

   The Integration Service MUST provide routing capabilities for
   payloads between producers and consumers.  The Integration Service
   MAY provide further capabilities within the payload delivery
   pipeline.  Examples of these capabilities include, but are not
   limited to, intermediate processing, message transformation, type
   conversion, validation, or other enterprise integration patterns.

4.2.  Downstream Uses

   As depicted by Figure 2, a number of downstream uses exist in the
   cooperative ecosystem.  Each notional SACM component represents
   distinct sub-architectures which will exchange information via the
   integration services, using interactions described in this draft.

4.2.1.  Reporting

   The Reporting component represents capabilities outside of the SACM
   architecture scope dealing with the query and retrieval of collected
   posture attribute information, evaluation results, etc. in various
   display formats that are useful to a wide range of stakeholders.

4.2.2.  Analytics

   The Analytics component represents capabilities outside of the SACM
   architecture scope dealing with the discovery, interpretation, and
   communication of any meaningful patterns of data in order to inform
   effective decision making within the organization.

4.3.  Sub-Architectures

   Figure 2 shows two components representing sub-architectural roles
   involved in a cooperative ecosystem of SACM components for the
   purpose of posture assessment: Collection and Evaluation.

4.3.1.  Collection Sub-Architecture

   The Collection sub-architecture is, in a SACM context, the mechanism
   by which posture attributes are collected from applicable endpoints
   and persisted to a repository, such as a configuration management
   database (CMDB).  Control plane functions initiated by the Manager
   will coordinate the necessary orchestration components, who will
   choreograph endpoint data collection via defined interactions, using
   the Integration Service as a message broker.  Instructions to perform
   endpoint data collection are directed to a Posture Collection Service

Internet-Draft              SACM Architecture                  July 2021


   capable of performing collection activities utilizing any number of
   protocols, such as SNMP, NETCONF/RESTCONF, SCAP, SSH, WinRM, packet
   capture, or host-based.  Instructions are orchestrated with the
   appropriate Posture Collection Services using serializations
   supported according to the collector's capabilities.

4.3.1.1.  Posture Collection Service

   The Posture Collection Service (PCS) is a SACM component responsible
   for the collection of posture attributes from an endpoint or set of
   endpoints.  A single PCS MAY be responsible for management of posture
   attribute collection from many endpoints.  The PCS will interact with
   the Integration Service to receive collection instructions, and to
   provide collected posture attributes for persistence to one or more
   Posture Attribute Repositories.  Collection instructions may be
   supplied in a variety of forms, including subscription to a publish/
   subscribe topic to which the Integration Service has published
   instructions, or via request/response-style messaging (either
   synchronous or asynchronous).

   Four classifications of posture collections MAY be supported.

4.3.1.1.1.  Ad-Hoc

   Ad-Hoc collection is defined as a single colletion of posture
   attributes, collected at a particular time.  An example of ad-hoc
   collection is the single collection of a specific registry key.

4.3.1.1.2.  Continuous/Scheduled

   Continuous/Scheduled collection is defined as the ongoing, periodic
   collection of posture attributes.  An example of scheduled collection
   is the collection of a specific registry key value every day at a
   given time.

4.3.1.1.3.  Observational

   This classification of collection is triggered by the observation,
   external to an endpoint, of information asserting posture attribute
   values for that endpoint.  An example of observational collection is
   examination of netflow data for particular packet captures and/or
   specific information within those captures.

4.3.1.1.4.  Event-based

   Event-based collection may be triggered either internally or
   externally to the endpoint.  Internal event-based collection is
   triggered when a posture attribute of interest is added, removed, or
   modified on an endpoint.  This modification indicates a change in the
   current state of the endpoint, potentially affecting its adherence to
   some defined policy.  Modification of the endpoint's minimum password
   length is an example of an attribute change which could trigger
   collection.

Internet-Draft              SACM Architecture                  July 2021


   External event-based collection can be described as a collector being
   subscribed to an external source of information, receiving events
   from that external source on a periodic or continuous basis.  An
   example of event-based collection is subscription to YANG Push
   notifications.

4.3.1.2.  Endpoint

   Building upon [I-D.ietf-sacm-terminology], the SACM Collection Sub-
   Architecture augments the definition of an Endpoint as a component
   within an organization's management domain from which a Posture
   Collection Service will collect relevant posture attributes.

4.3.1.3.  Posture Attribute Repository

   The Posture Attribute Repository is a SACM component responsible for
   the persistent storage of posture attributes collected via
   interactions between the Posture Collection Service and Endpoints.

4.3.1.4.  Posture Collection Workflow

   Posture collection may be triggered from a number of components, but
   commonly begin either via event-based triggering on an endpoint or
   through manual orchestration, both illustrated in Figure 3 above.
   Once orchestration has provided the directive to perform collection,
   posture collection services consume the directives.  Posture
   collection is invoked for those endpoints overseen by the respective
   posture collection services.  Collected data is then provided to the
   Integration Service, with a directive to store that information in an
   appropriate repository.

4.3.2.  Evaluation Sub-Architecture

   The Evaluation Sub-Architecture, in the SACM context, is the
   mechanism by which policy, expressed in the form of expected state,
   is compared with collected posture attributes to yield an evaluation
   result, that result being contextually dependent on the policy being
   evaluated.

4.3.2.1.  Posture Evaluation Service

   The Posture Evaluation Service (PES) represents the SACM component
   responsible for coordinating the policy to be evaluated and the
   collected posture attributes relevant to that policy, as well as the
   comparison engine responsible for correctly determining compliance
   with the expected state.

4.3.2.2.  Policy Repository

   The Policy Repository represents a persistent storage mechanism for
   the policy to be assessed against collected posture attributes to
   determine if an endpoint meets the desired expected state.  Examples
   of information contained in a Policy Repository would be
   Vulnerability Definition Data or configuration recommendations as
   part of a CIS Benchmark or DISA STIG.

4.3.2.3.  Evaluation Results Repository

   The Evaluation Results Repository persists the information
   representing the results of a particular posture assessment,
   indicating those posture attributes collected from various endpoints
   which either meet or do not meet the expected state defined by the
   assessed policy.  Consideration should be made for the context of
   individual results.  For example, meeting the expected state for a
   configuration attribute indicates a correct configuration of the
   endpoint, whereas meeting an expected state for a vulnerable software
   version indicates an incorrect configuration.

4.3.2.4.  Posture Evaluation Workflow

   Posture evaluation is orchestrated through the Integration Service to
   the appropriate Posture Evaluation Service (PES).  The PES will,
   using interactions defined by the applicable taxonomy, query both the
   Posture Attribute Repository and the Policy Repository to obtain
   relevant state data for comparison.  If necessary, the PES may be
   required to invoke further posture collection.  Once all relevant
   posture information has been collected, it is compared to expected
   state based on applicable policy.  Comparison results are then
   persisted to an evaluation results repository for further downstream
   use and analysis.

5.  Ecosystem Interactions

   Ecosystem interactions describe the various functions between SACM
   components, including manager requirements, the onboarding of
   components, capability advertisement, administrative actions, and
   status updates, among others.  The Manager component acts as the
   administrative "lead" for the SACM ecosystem, and must maintain
   records of registered components, manage capabilities, and more.

5.1.  Manager

   The Manager, being a specialized role in the architecture, enables
   the onboarding and capability management of the various SACM
   component roles.  The Manager must support the set of capabilities
   needed to operate the SACM ecosystem.

   With this in mind, the Manager must first authenticate to the
   Integration Service.  Once authentication has succeeded, the Manager
   MUST establish a service handler capable of performing SACM component
   registration/onboarding activities (Component Registration
   Operation).  The Manager MUST also establish a subscription to an
   ecosystem-wide status notification mechanism, in order to receive
   published status updates from other SACM components.

Internet-Draft              SACM Architecture                  July 2021


   The following requirements exist for the Manager to establish service
   handlers supporting the component registration taxonomy (Component
   Registration Operation):

   *  The Manager MUST enable the capability to receive onboarding
      requests,

   *  The Manager MUST have the capability to generate, manage, and
      persist unique identifiers for all registered components,

   *  The Manager MUST maintain the relationships between capabilities
      and payload categorizations (such as topic names or specific
      payload identifiers),

   *  The Manager MUST have the capability to inventory and manage its
      "roster" (the list of registered components),

   *  The Manager MUST have the capability to manage its roster's
      advertised capabilities, including those endpoints to which those
      capabilities apply.

   *  In addition to supporting component registration, the Manager is
      responsible for many of the operational functions of the
      architecture, including initiating collection or evaluation,
      queries for repository data, or the assembly of information for
      downstream use.

   *  The Manager MUST support making directed requests to registered
      components over the component's administrative interface.
      Administrative interface functions are described by their
      taxonomy, below.

   *  The Manager MUST support each of the interaction categories as
      described above.

5.2.  Component Registration

   Component registration describes how an individual component becomes
   part of the SACM ecosystem; authenticating to the Integration
   Service, registering and establishing its administrative interface
   with, the Manager.

   The component onboarding workflow involves multiple steps:

   *  The component first authenticates to the Integration Service.

Internet-Draft              SACM Architecture                  July 2021


   *  The component initiates registration with the Manager, per the
      component registration operation (Component Registration
      Operation).

   *  The component handles the response from the Manager to configure a
      service handler allowing the component to receive directed
      messages over the administrative interface with the Manager.

5.3.  Administrative Interface

   The administrative interface represents a direct communication
   channel between the Manager and any registered Component.  This
   interface allows the Manager to make directed requests to a component
   in order to perform specific actions.

5.3.1.  Capability Advertisement Handshake

   Capability Advertisement is the mechanism by which components
   initially indicate their capabilities to the Manager.  This handshake
   is completed using the administrative interface with the Manager.  It
   becomes the Manager's responsibility to persist component/capability
   relationships, and to provide the component the information necessary
   to receive and process message payloads specific to the supported
   capabilities.

5.3.2.  Health Check

   The administrative "health check" is a mechanism by which the Manager
   queries for the "liveness" of its roster of components, and to
   possibly alert users or other systems when components are no longer
   present.  The Manager MAY enable a periodic message to each component
   to determine if that component is still listening to the
   Administrative Interface.  The Health Check interaction MAY include a
   request for "Capability Refresh", to reinitiate the Capability
   Advertisement Handshake.  This interaction is similar to the
   "Heartbeat" interaction, but is initiated by the Manager.

5.3.3.  Heartbeat

   The administrative "heartbeat" is a mechanism by which a Component
   indicates to the Manager that the Component remains connected to the
   ecosystem.  The Heartbeat differs from the Health Check interaction
   in that the Component initiates the interaction, and that no response
   from the Manager is required.

Internet-Draft              SACM Architecture                  July 2021


5.3.4.  Capability-specific Requests

   Any number of capability-specific requests can be enabled through the
   administrative interface that allow the Manager to direct actions to
   be performed by a specific component.  Utilizing the interface from a
   component to the Manager, this interface can be used to indicate a
   component has come back online, or to provide an updated capability
   advertisement, potentially resulting in updates to subscriptions or
   service handlers.

5.4.  Status Notifications

   A generic status notifications mechanism SHOULD be configured to
   which (a) the Manager is subscribed, and (b) all onboarded components
   can publish.  Status notifications may be used by the Manager to
   update user interfaces, to provide notification of the start, finish,
   success or failure of ecosystem operations, or as events to trigger
   subsequent activities.

5.5.  Component Interactions

   Component interactions describe functionality between components
   relating to collection, evaluation, or other downstream processes.
   The following component interactions begin with the Manager providing
   a set of instructions to an Orchestrator or set of Orchestrators that
   have registered with the SACM ecosystem indicating the appropriate
   capabilities, such as collection or evaluation.  Subscribing
   Orchestrator(s) MAY translate, manipulate, filter, augment, or
   otherwise transform the Manager's instructions into content supported
   through the Orchestrator's capabilities.

5.5.1.  Initiate Ad-Hoc Collection

   The Orchestrator supplies a payload of collection instructions to a
   Posture Collection Service either through direct or broadcast
   mechanisms.  The receiving PCS components perform the required
   collection based on their capabilities.  Each PCS then forms a
   payload of collected posture attributes (including endpoint
   identifying information) and provides that payload to the Posture
   Attribute Repository interface, for persistence.

5.5.2.  Coordinate Periodic Collection

   Similar to ad-hoc collection, the Orchestrator supplies a payload of
   collection instructions similar to those of ad-hoc collection.
   Additional information elements containing collection identification
   and periodicity are included.

Internet-Draft              SACM Architecture                  July 2021


5.5.2.1.  Schedule Periodic Collection

   To enable operations on periodic collection, the scheduling payload
   MUST include both a unique identifier for the set of collection
   instructions, as well as a periodicity expression to enable the
   collection schedule.  An optional "immediate collection" flag will
   indicate to the collection component that, upon receipt of the
   collection instructions, a collection will automatically be initiated
   prior to engagement of the scheduled collection.

5.5.2.2.  Cancel Periodic Collection

   The Orchestrator disables the periodic collection of posture
   attributes by supplying collector(s) the unique identifier of
   previously scheduled collection instructions.  An optional "final
   collection" flag will indicate to the collection component that, upon
   receipt of the cancellation instructions, a final ad-hoc collection
   is to take place.

5.5.3.  Coordinate Observational/Event-based Collection

   In these scenarios, the Posture Collection Service acts as the
   "observer".  Interactions with the observer could specify a time
   period of observation and potentially information intended to filter
   observed posture attributes to aid the PCS in determining those
   attributes that are applicable for collection and persistence to the
   Posture Attribute Repository.

5.5.3.1.  Initiate Observational/Event-based Collection

   The Orchestrator supplies a payload of instructions to a topic or set
   of topics to which Posture Collection Services (observers) are
   subscribed.  This payload could include specific instructions based
   on the observer's capabilities to determine specific posture
   attributes to observe and collect.

5.5.3.2.  Cancel Observational/Event-based Collection

   The Orchestrator supplies a payload of instructions to a topic or set
   of topics to which Posture Collection Services are subscribed.  The
   receiving PCS components cancel the identified observational/event-
   based collection executing on those PCS components.

Internet-Draft              SACM Architecture                  July 2021


5.5.4.  Persist Collected Posture Attributes

   Following successful collection, Posture Collection Services (PCS)
   will supply the payload of collected posture attributes to the
   interface(s) supporting the persistent storage of those attributes to
   the Posture Attribute Repository.  Information in this payload should
   include identifying information of the computing resource(s) for
   which attributes were collected.

5.5.5.  Initiate Ad-Hoc Evaluation

   The Orchestrator supplies a payload of evaluation instructions to a
   Posture Evaluation Services (PES) either through direct or broadcast
   mechanisms.  The receiving PES components perform the required
   evaluation based on their capabilities.  The PES generates a payload
   of posture evaluation results and publishes that payload to the
   Evaluation Results Repository interface, for persistence.

5.5.6.  Coordinate Periodic Evaluation

   Similar to ad-hoc evaluation, the Orchestrator supplies a payload of
   evaluation instructions similar to those of ad-hoc evaluation.
   Additional information elements containing evaluation identification
   and periodicity are included.

5.5.6.1.  Schedule Periodic Evaluation

   To enable operations on periodic evaluation, the scheduling payload
   MUST include both a unique identifier for the set of evaluation
   instructions, as well as a periodicity expression to enable the
   evaluation schedule.  An optional "immediate evaluation" flag will
   indicate to the Posture Evaluation Service (PES) that, upon receipt
   of the evaluation instructions, an evaluation will automatically be
   initiated prior to engagement of the scheduled evaluation.

5.5.6.2.  Cancel Periodic Evaluation

   The Orchestrator disables the periodic evaluation of posture
   attributes by supplying Posture Evaluation Service(s) the unique
   identifier of previously scheduled evaluation instructions.  An
   optional "final evaluation" flag will indicate to the PES that, upon
   receipt of the cancellation instructions, a final ad-hoc evaluation
   is to take place.

5.5.7.  Coordinate Change-based Evaluation

   A more fine-grained approach to periodic evaluation may be enabled
   through the triggering of Posture Evaluation based on changes to
   posture attribute values at the time of their collection and
   persistence to the Posture Attribute Repository.

5.5.7.1.  Identify Attributes

   The Orchestrator enables change-based evaluation through a payload
   published to Posture Attribute Repository component(s).  This payload
   includes appropriate information elements describing the posture
   attributes on which changes in value will trigger posture evaluation.

5.5.7.2.  Cancel Change-based Evaluation

   An Orchestrator may disable change-based evaluation through a payload
   published to Posture Attribute Repository component(s), including
   those information elements necessary to identify those posture
   attributes for which change-based evaluation no longer applies.

5.5.8.  Queries

   Queries should allow for a "freshness" time period, allowing the
   requesting entity to determine if/when posture attributes must be re-
   collected prior to performing evaluation.  This freshness time period
   can be "zeroed out" for the purpose of automatically triggering re-
   collection regardless of the most recent collection.

6.  Operations

   The following sections describe a number of operations required to
   enable a cooperative ecosystem of posture attribute collection and
   evaluation functions.

6.1.  Component Registration

   Component registration describes how an individual component becomes
   part of the SACM ecosystem; registering with the Manager, and
   establishing the administrative interface.

   *  Interaction Type: Directed (Request/Response)

   *  Source Component: Any component wishing to join the ecosystem,
      such as Posture Collection Services, Repository Interfaces,
      Posture Evaluation Services and more.

   *  Target Component(s): Manager

Internet-Draft              SACM Architecture                  July 2021


6.1.1.  Request Payload

   When a component onboards with the ecosystem, it must identify itself
   to the Manager, using either descriptive information or an already-
   existing component unique identifier.

   component-registration-request:
     {:component-identification:}

   component-identification:
     component-unique-identifier (if re-establishing communication)
       #-OR-#
     component-type {:component-type:}
     component-name
     component-description (optional)

   component-type:
     enumeration:
       - posture-collection-service
       - posture-evaluation-service
       - repository-interface
       - orchestrator
       - others?

   When registering for the first time, the component will send
   identifying information including the component type and a name.  If
   the component is re-establishing communications, for example after a
   restart of the component or deployment of a new version, the
   component only needs to supply its previously generated (and
   persisted) [component-unique-identifier].

6.1.2.  Request Processing

   When the Manager receives the component's request for onboarding, it
   will:

   *  Generate a unique identifier, "[component-unique-identifier]", for
      the onboarding component,

   *  Persist identifying information, including the "[component-unique-
      identifier]" to its component inventory, enabling an up-to-date
      roster of components being managed,

   *  Establish the administrative interface to the onboarded component
      by enabling a service handler to listen for directed messages from
      the component.

Internet-Draft              SACM Architecture                  July 2021


6.1.3.  Response Payload

   The Manager will respond to the component with a payload including
   the component's unique identifier.  At this point, the Manager is
   aware of the component's existence in the ecosystem, and the
   component can self-identify by virtue of receiving its unique
   identifier.

   component-registration-response:
     component-unique-identifier: [component-unique-identifier]

6.1.4.  Response Processing

   Successful receipt of the Manager's response, including the
   "[component-unique-identifier]", indicates the component is onboarded
   to the ecosystem.  Using the response payload, the component can then
   establish it's end of the administrative interface with the Manager.
   The component must then persist it's unique identifier for use when
   re-establishing communication with the Manager after failure recovery
   or restart.

6.2.  Administrative Interface

   A number of functions may take place which, instead of being
   published to multiple subscribers, may require direct interaction
   between the Manager and a registered component (and vice-versa).
   During component onboarding, this direct channel, known as the
   Administrative Interface, is established first by the Manager and
   subsequently complemented by the component onboarding the SACM
   ecosystem.  Three operations are defined for the administrative
   interface, but any number of application or capability-specific
   operations MAY be enabled using the directed messaging provided by
   this interface.

6.2.1.  Capability Advertisement Handshake

   Capability advertisement represents the ability of any registered
   component to inform the Manager of that component's capacity for
   performing certain operations.  For example, a Posture Collection
   Service component may advertise its capability to perform collection
   using a particular collection system/serialization.  This capability
   advertisement is important for the Manager to persist in order for
   the Manager to correctly classify components registered within the
   SACM ecosystem, and therefore provide the ability to publish messages
   to components in accordance with their capabilities.

   *  Interaction Type: Directed (Request/Response)

   *  Source Component: Any registered component, such as Posture
      Collection Services, Repository Interfaces, Posture Evaluation
      Services and more.

   *  Target Component(s): Manager

6.2.1.1.  Request Payload

   The component's capability advertisement request payload will include
   a list of "Capability URNs" (TBD IANA SECTION) that represent it's
   supported operational capabilities.

   capability-advertisement:
     capabilities:
       capability-urn: [urn]
       capability-urn: [urn]
       capability-urn: [urn]
       ...

6.2.1.2.  Request Processing

   Upon receipt of the component's capability advertisement, the Manager
   SHOULD:

   *  Persist the component's capabilities to the Manager's inventory

   *  Coordinate, based on the supplied capabilities, the service
      handlers (for directed messages) and/or event listeners (for
      broadcast messages) to which the component should support.

6.2.1.3.  Response Payload

   The response payload delivered to the component should include the
   appropriate service handling/event listening information required for
   the component to handle further interactions based on each advertised
   capability.  If a capability was not registered successfully,
   appropriate error messages SHOULD be supplied to inform the component
   of the failure(s).

   capability-advertisement-response:
     capabilities:
       capability:
         capability-urn: [urn]
         registration-status: (success | failure)

         registration-status: (success | failure)
         service-handler-or-event-listener: [info]
         messages: [messages]

6.2.1.4.  Response Processing

   Once the component has received the response to its capability
   advertisement, it should configure the capability-specific service
   handler(s) or event listener(s).  Once these handlers/listeners have
   been configured, the component is considered fully onboarded to the
   SACM ecosystem.

6.2.2.  Health Check

   As time passes, it is important that the Manager maintains knowledge
   of all registered component's current operational status.  The health
   check operation describes the efforts taken by the Manager to
   maintain the most up-to-date inventory of it's component roster, and
   to potentially trigger events to users or outside systems (e.g. a
   SIEM or SOAR) indicating unavailable components.

   *  Interaction Type: Directed (Request/Response)

   *  Source Component: Manager

   *  Target Component(s): Any registered component, such as Posture
      Collection Services, Repository Interfaces, Posture Evaluation
      Services and more.

6.2.2.1.  Request Payload

   The request for the health check is a simple "ping".

   health-check-request:
     action: ping

Internet-Draft              SACM Architecture                  July 2021


6.2.2.2.  Request Processing

   When the target component receives the health check request, the
   target component need only respond that it is operational and
   connected to the integration service.  This is a simple "Hello
   component, are you listening?  Yes, I am" interaction.  The health
   check request from the Manager should be made with an appropriately
   small timeout indicator; only an operational component will be able
   to respond to the request, so if that component is offline and cannot
   respond, the Manager should not be kept waiting for an extended
   amount of time.

6.2.2.3.  Response Payload

   When responding to the health check request, the response payload
   will simply indicate success: ~~~~~~ health-check-response: response:
   success ~~~~~~

6.2.2.4.  Response Processing

   Upon receipt of the "health-check-response" payload, the Manager will
   update its inventory of currently operational components with the
   timestamp of the receipt.  Manager implementations may raise alerts,
   inform users, or take other actions when health checks are
   unsuccessful, at their discretion.

6.2.3.  Heartbeat

   As time passes and SACM ecosystem components which have previously
   registered are brought offline (perhaps for maintenance or
   redeployment) and back online, it is important that registered
   components maintain administrative contact with the Manager.  The
   heartbeat operation describes the efforts taken by a registered
   component to determine the status of contact with the Manager, and to
   take appropriate action if such contact cannot be made.

   *  Interaction Type: Directed (Request/Response)

   *  Source Component: Any registered component, such as Posture
      Collection Services, Repository Interfaces, Posture Evaluation
      Services and more.

   *  Target Component(s): Manager

6.2.3.1.  Request Payload

   The request payload simply defines the hearbeat action:

   heartbeat-request:
     action: pulse

6.2.3.2.  Request Processing

   When the Manager receives the heartbeat request, it need only respond
   that it is operational and connected to the integration service.
   This is a simple "Hello Manager, are you listening?  Yes, I am"
   interaction.  The heartbeat request from the component should be made
   with an appropriately small timeout indicator; only an operational
   Manager will be able to respond to the request, so if it is offline
   and cannot respond, the component should not be kept waiting for an
   extended amount of time.

6.2.3.3.  Response Payload

   When responding to the heartbeat request, the response payload will
   simply indicate success: ~~~~~~ heartbeat-response: response: success
   ~~~~~~

6.2.3.4.  Response Processing

   Upon receipt of the "heartbeat-response" payload, the component may
   reset its heartbeat timer and continue normal operations, awaiting
   incoming message payloads.  Component implementations may raise
   alerts, inform users, or take other actions when heartbeat requests
   are unsuccessful (potentially indicating a downed Manager), at their
   discretion.

6.3.  Status Notification

   From time to time during the performance of any given operation, a
   component may need to supply status information to the Manager (or
   any other concerned component), for use in display to users, or to
   trigger other events within the SACM ecosystem.  The status
   notification operation is designed to allow any component to
   broadcast status message payloads to any subscribers with the need to
   know.  For example, a collection component could broadcast to the
   Manager that it has initiated collection, subsequent collection
   progress updates, and finally completion or error conditions.

   *  Interaction Type: Broadcast (Publish/Subscribe)

   *  Source Component: Any registered component, such as Posture
      Collection Services, Repository Interfaces, Posture Evaluation
      Services and more.

Internet-Draft              SACM Architecture                  July 2021


   *  Target Component(s): Typically the Manager, but any registered
      component may subscribe to status notifications.

6.3.1.  Request Payload

   At a minimum, the payload broadcast for a status notification MUST
   include the status message and the publishing component's "component-
   unique-identifier".  Further identifying information, such as status
   codes, operation indicators, etc., MAY be provided by implementing
   components.

   status-notification:
     publisher: [component-unique-identifier]
     message: [message]
     [additional information]

6.3.2.  Request Processing

   When subscribers are notified of the status message, respective
   components may act upon them in component/application-specific ways,
   including persisting those messages to repositories, forwarding to
   log aggregation tools, displaying on user interfaces, and so on.
   Potential for use of component status notifications is only limited
   by application implementations.

6.4.  Initiate Ad-Hoc Collection

   The Ad-hoc collection workflow MAY be initiated by the Manager, via
   user interaction, or through a Posture Evaluation Service, and
   represents a single, point-in-time operation to collect posture
   attributes from applicable endpoints.  The SACM Producer initiates a
   message payload, either through directed channels (such as the
   administrative interface) or through broadcast notifications to
   multiple subscribers, to Orchestrator components.  Orchestrators MAY
   manipulate the Manager's collection instructions according to various
   collection capabilities, prior to providing those instructions to
   Posture Collection Service (PCS) components.  Once collection
   instructions are received by the PCS, it will collect the requested
   posture attributes from the designated endpoints, using its
   advertised collection capabilities.  The following diagram

   1.  The Manager initiates a request to one or more Orchestrators to
       perform collection,

   2.  The Orchestrator receives collection instructions and potentially
       manipulates them according to one or more collection
       capabilities,

   3.  The Orchestrator publishes a notification to subscribed Posture
       Collection Service components, indicating the posture attributes
       to be collected,

   4.  The Posture Collection Service receives the collection
       instructions and performs the actual collection of posture
       attributes from an endpoint or endpoints.

   5.  The Posture Collection Service publishes a notification(s)
       containing the collected posture attributes to be persisted to
       the Posture Attribute Repository,

   6.  The Posture Attribute Repository persists the collected posture
       attributes, potentially performing normalization of the data as
       part of its process.

   Interactions labeled (S) indicate the capability of each component to
   publish status notifications, subscribed to by the Manager.

6.4.1.  SACM Producer to Orchestrator

   The Ad-hoc collection workflow MAY be initiated by a number of SACM
   components, such as the Manager, a Posture Evaluation Service, or
   other events outside the scope of this document.

   *  Interaction Type: Directed (Request/Response) or Broadcast
      (Publish/Subscribe)

   *  Source Component: Various

   *  Target Component(s): Orchestrator

6.4.1.1.  Request Payload

   A request to orchestrate posture attribute collection MUST include
   enough information to describe those attributes being collected, and
   MAY include endpoint targeting information.

   collection-instructions:
     TBD

6.4.1.2.  Request Processing

   When the Orchestrator receives the collection instructions, it may be
   required to manipulate them according to the capabilities it's
   collector(s) support.  For example, generic collection instructions
   could be transformed to the appropriate OVAL serialization for
   collection via OVAL-compliant collectors.

6.4.1.3.  Response Payload

   Orchestrators have the option to provide broadcast status update
   messages to indicate success, failure, or other error messages when
   receiving posture collection orchestration payloads.

6.4.1.4.  Response Processing

   N/A

6.4.2.  Orchestrator to Posture Collection Service

   Once the Orchestrator has received collection instructions from the
   initiating SACM component, and has performed any manipulation of the
   instructions to conform to it's capabilities, it will provide those
   instructions to relevant Posture Collection Services.

   *  Interaction Type: Directed (Request/Response) or Broadcast
      (Publish/Subscribe)

   *  Source Component: Orchestrator

   *  Target Component(s): Posture Collection Service

6.4.2.1.  Request Payload

   The payload exchanged between the Orchestrator and it's associated
   Posture Collection Services will be collection instructions adhering
   to a data model supported by the PCS based on its advertised
   capabilities.

   collection-instructions:
     TBD

6.4.2.2.  Request Processing

   Upon receipt of the payload containing collection instructions, the
   Posture Collection Service should parse and validate them, indicating
   any errors in the process.  If the payload does not conform to any
   serialization or data model to which the PCS' capabilities
   correspond, status messages indicating such nonconformance SHOULD be
   provided to both the Orchestrator and the initiating SACM producer.

   Once successfully parsed and validated, the PCS MUST perform
   collection of posture attributes according to the collection
   instructions, from any endpoint to which the PCS has access, or from
   the list of endpoints described in any targeting information included
   in the collection instructions.

6.4.2.3.  Response Payload

   Posture Collection Service components will respond using the generic
   status update mechanisms to indicate success, failure, or any errors
   that occur.  Errors may occur parsing collection instructions,
   verifying them, targeting indicated endpoints, or from the act of
   collecting the indicated posture attributes.

6.4.2.4.  Response Processing

   Any messages received by components regarding the success, failure,
   or errors involved in the collection of posture attributes MAY be
   processed according to the receiving components' capabilities.

6.4.3.  Posture Collection Service to Posture Attribute Repository

   Upon completion of posture attribute collection, the PCS constructs
   the payload of collected attributes based on its advertised
   capabilities, e.g.  OVAL system characteristics.  This payload is
   provided to either a specific posture attribute repository via
   directed messages or to subscribed repository interfaces via
   broadcast messages.

   *  Interaction Type: Directed (Request/Response) or Broadcast
      (Publish/Subscribe)

   *  Source Component: Posture Collection Service

   *  Target Component(s): Posture Attribute Repository

6.4.3.1.  Request Payload

   The payload supplied by the Posture Collection Service SHOULD conform
   to information and data models supported by its advertised
   capabilities.  These data models, at a minimum, SHOULD include name/
   value pairs for each collected attribute.

   collection-results:
     [
       attribute-name,
       attribute-value
     ]

6.4.3.2.  Request Processing

   As the Posture Attribute Repository interface receives the payload of
   collected posture attributes, some data normalization MAY occur in
   order to persist the information most efficiently based on the
   persistence technology.  This normalization is dependent on the
   implementation of the repository interface as well as the persistence
   technology.  For example, OVAL system characteristics, an XML
   payload, could be normalized to a property graph representation when
   persisted to a Neo4j database.

6.4.3.3.  Response Payload

   Once the Posture Attribute Repository has received, it MAY respond to
   the Posture Collection Service that it has successfully received the
   collected posture attributes.  This response would only be applicable
   when receiving payloads via directed requests.  If payloads are
   received via broadcast interactions, there may not be a PCS to which
   a response can be sent.  The Posture Attribute Repository MAY utilize

   the generic status update interactions to provide response messages
   to appropriate subscribers.

6.4.3.4.  Response Processing

   Any messages received by components regarding the success, failure,
   or errors involved in the persistence of collected posture attributes
   MAY be processed according to the receiving components' capabilities.
   For example, a generic status update message could be processed by a
   Manager component, correlated with the initial posture collection
   instructions in order to "close the loop" on the posture attribute
   collection workflow.

Appendix A.  Security Domain Workflows

   This section describes three primary information security domains
   from which workflows may be derived: IT Asset Management,
   Vulnerability Management, and Configuration Management.

A.1.  IT Asset Management

   Information Technology asset management is easier said than done.
   The [CISCONTROLS] have two controls dealing with IT asset management.
   Control 1, Inventory and Control of Hardware Assets, states,
   "Actively manage (inventory, track, and correct) all hardware devices
   on the network so that only authorized devices are given access, and
   unauthorized and unmanaged devices are found and prevented from

   In spirit, this covers all of the processing entities on your network
   (as opposed to things like network cables, dongles, adapters, etc.),
   whether physical or virtual, on-premises or in the cloud.

A.1.1.1.  Components

A.1.1.2.  Capabilities

   An IT asset management capability needs to be able to:

   *  Identify and catalog new assets by executing Target Endpoint
      Discovery Tasks

   *  Provide information about its managed assets, including uniquely
      identifying information (for that enterprise)

   *  Handle software and/or hardware (including virtual assets)

   *  Represent cloud hybrid environments

A.2.  Vulnerability Management

   Vulnerability management is a relatively established process.  To
   paraphrase the [CISCONTROLS], continuous vulnerability management is
   the act of continuously acquiring, assessing, and taking subsequent
   action on new information in order to identify and remediate
   vulnerabilities, therefore minimizing the window of opportunity for
   attackers.

   A vulnerability assessment (i.e. vulnerability detection) is
   performed in two steps:

   *  Endpoint information collected by the endpoint management
      capabilities is examined by the vulnerability management
      capabilities through Evaluation Tasks.

Internet-Draft              SACM Architecture                  July 2021


   *  If the data possessed by the endpoint management capabilities is
      insufficient, a Collection Task is triggered and the necessary
      data is collected from the target endpoint.

   Vulnerability detection relies on the examination of different
   endpoint information depending on the nature of a specific
   vulnerability.  Common endpoint information used to detect a
   vulnerability includes:

   *  A specific software version is installed on the endpoint

   *  File system attributes

   *  Specific state attributes

   In some cases, the endpoint information needed to determine an
   endpoint's vulnerability status will have been previously collected
   by the endpoint management capabilities and available in a
   Repository.  However, in other cases, the necessary endpoint
   information will not be readily available in a Repository and a
   Collection Task will be triggered to perform collection from the
   target endpoint.  Of course, some implementations of endpoint
   management capabilities may prefer to enable operators to perform
   this collection even when sufficient information can be provided by
   the endpoint management capabilities (e.g. there may be freshness
   requirements for information).

A.3.  Configuration Management

   Configuration management involves configuration assessment, which
   requires state assessment.  The [CISCONTROLS] specify two high-level
   controls concerning configuration management (Control 5 for non-
   network devices and Control 11 for network devices).  As an aside,
   these controls are listed separately because many enterprises have
   different organizations for managing network infrastructure and
   workload endpoints.  Merging the two controls results in the
   following paraphrasing: Establish, implement, and actively manage
   (track, report on, correct) the security configuration of systems
   using a rigorous configuration management and change control process
   in order to prevent attackers from exploiting vulnerable services and
   settings.

   Typically, an enterprise will use configuration guidance from a
   reputable source, and from time to time they may tailor the guidance
   from that source prior to adopting it as part of their enterprise
   standard.  The enterprise standard is then provided to the
   appropriate configuration assessment tools and they assess endpoints
   and/or appropriate endpoint information.

   A preferred flow follows:

   *  Reputable source publishes new or updated configuration guidance

   *  Enterprise configuration assessment capability retrieves
      configuration guidance from reputable source

   *  Optional: Configuration guidance is tailored for enterprise-
      specific needs

   *  Configuration assessment tool queries asset inventory repository
      to retrieve a list of affected endpoints

   *  Configuration assessment tool queries configuration state
      repository to evaluate compliance

   *  If information is stale or unavailable, configuration assessment
      tool triggers an ad hoc assessment

   The SACM architecture needs to support varying deployment models to
   accommodate the current state of the industry, but should strongly
   encourage event-driven approaches to monitoring configuration.

A.3.1.  Components, Capabilities and Workflow(s)

   This section provides more detail about the components and
   capabilities required when considering the aforementioned
   configuration management workflow.

A.3.1.1.  Components

   The following is a minimal list of SACM Components required to
   implement the aforementioned configuration assessment workflow.

   *  Configuration Policy Feed: An external source of authoritative
      configuration recommendations.

   *  Configuration Policy Repository: An internal repository of
      enterprise standard configurations.

   *  Configuration Assessment Orchestrator: A component responsible for
      orchestrating assessments.

   *  Posture Attribute Collection Subsystem: A component responsible
      for collection of posture attributes from systems.

   *  Posture Attribute Repository: A component used for storing system
      posture attribute values.

   *  Configuration Assessment Evaluator: A component responsible for
      evaluating system posture attribute values against expected
      posture attribute values.

   *  Configuration Assessment Results Repository: A component used for
      storing evaluation results.

A.3.1.2.  Capabilities

   Per [RFC8248], solutions MUST support capability negotiation.
   Components implementing specific interfaces and operations (i.e.
   interactions) will need a method of describing their capabilities to
   other components participating in the ecosystem; for example, "As a
   component in the ecosystem, I can assess the configuration of
   Windows, MacOS, and AWS using OVAL".

A.3.1.3.  Configuration Assessment Workflow

   This section describes the components and interactions in a basic
   configuration assessment workflow.  For simplicity, error conditions
   are recognized as being necessary and are not depicted.  When one
   component messages another component, the message is expected to be
   handled appropriately unless there is an error condition, or other
   notification, messaged in return.

      Figure 5: Configuration Assessment Component Interactions

   Figure 5 depicts configuration assessment components and their
   interactions, which are further described below.

   1.   A policy feed provides a configuration assessment policy payload
        to the Integration Service.

   2.   The Policy Repository, a consumer of Policy Feed information,
        receives and persists the Policy Feed's payload.

   3.   Orchestration component(s), either manually invoked, scheduled,
        or event-based, publish a payload to begin the configuration
        assessment process.

   4.   If necessary, Collection Sub-Architecture components may be
        invoked to collect neeeded posture attribute information.

   5.   If necessary, the Collection Sub-Architecture will provide
        collected posture attributes to the Integration Service for
        persistence to the Posture Attribute Repository.

   6.   The Posture Attribute Repository will consume a payload querying
        for relevant posture attribute information.

   7.   The Posture Attribute Repository will provide the requested
        information to the Integration Service, allowing further
        orchestration payloads requesting the Evaluation Sub-
        Architecture perform evaluation tasks.

   8.   The Evaluation Sub-Architecture consumes the evaluation payload
        and performs component-specific state comparison operations to
        produce evaluation results.

   9.   A payload containing evaluation results are provided by the
        Evaluation Sub-Architecture to the Integration Service

   10.  Evaluation results are consumed by/persisted to the Evaluation
        Results Repository

   In the above flow, the payload information is expected to convey the
   context required by the receiving component for the action being
   taken under different circumstances.  For example, a directed message
   sent from an Orchestrator to a Collection sub-architecture might be
   telling that Collector to watch a specific posture attribute and
   report only specific detected changes to the Posture Attribute
   Repository, or it might be telling the Collector to gather that
   posture attribute immediately.  Such details are expected to be
   handled as part of that payload, not as part of the architecture
   described herein.
