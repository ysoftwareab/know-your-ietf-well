Abstract

   End-to-end cryptographic protections for e-mail messages can provide
   useful security.  However, the standards for providing cryptographic
   protection are extremely flexible.  That flexibility can trap users
   and cause surprising failures.  This document offers guidance for
   mail user agent implementers that need to compose or interpret e-mail
   messages with end-to-end cryptographic protection.  It provides a
   useful set of vocabulary as well as suggestions to avoid common
   failures.

1.  Introduction

   E-mail end-to-end security using S/MIME [RFC8551] and PGP/MIME
   [RFC3156] cryptographic standards can provide integrity,
   authentication and confidentiality to MIME e-mail messages [RFC4289].

   However, there are many ways that a receiving mail user agent can
   misinterpret or accidentally break these security guarantees (e.g.,
   [EFAIL]).

   A mail user agent that interprets a message with end-to-end
   cryptographic protections needs to do so defensively, staying alert
   to different ways that these protections can be bypassed by mangling
   (either malicious or accidental) or a failed user experience.

   A mail user agent that generates a message with end-to-end
   cryptographic protections should be aware of these defensive
   interpretation strategies, and should compose any new outbound
   message conservatively if they want the protections to remain intact.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 ([RFC2119] and [RFC8174]) when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Terminology

   For the purposes of this document, we define the following concepts:

   *  _MUA_ is short for Mail User Agent; an e-mail client.

   *  _Protection_ of message data refers to cryptographic encryption
      and/or signatures, providing confidentiality, authenticity, and/or
      integrity.

   *  _Cryptographic Layer_, _Cryptographic Envelope_, _Cryptographic
      Payload_, and _Errant Cryptographic Layer_ are defined in
      Section 4

Internet-Draft   Guidance on End-to-End E-mail Security     October 2020


   *  A _well-formed_ e-mail message with cryptographic protection has
      both a _Cryptographic Envelope_ and a _Cryptographic Payload_,

   *  _Structural Headers_ are documented in Section 1.2.1.

1.2.1.  Structural Headers

   A message header whose name begins with "Content-" is referred to in
   this document as a "structural" header.

   These headers indicate something about the specific MIME part they
   are attached to, and cannot be transferred or copied to other parts
   without endangering the readability of the message.

   This includes (but is not limited to):

   *  "Content-Type"

   *  "Content-Transfer-Encoding"

   *  "Content-Disposition"

   FIXME: are there any non-"Content-*" headers we should consider as
   structural?

2.  Usability

   The end user (the operator of the MUA) is unlikely to understand
   complex end-to-end cryptographic protections on any e-mail message,
   so keep it simple.

   For clarity to the user, any cryptographic protections should apply
   to the message as a whole, not just to some subparts.

   This is true for message composition: the standard message
   composition user interface of an MUA should offer minimal controls
   which indicate which types of protection to apply to the new message
   as a whole.

   This is also true for message interpretation: the standard message
   rendering user interface of an MUA should offer a minimal, clear
   indicator about the end-to-end cryptographic status of the message as
   a whole.

3.  Types of Protection

   A given message might be:

Internet-Draft   Guidance on End-to-End E-mail Security     October 2020


   *  signed,

   *  encrypted, or

   *  both signed and encrypted.

   Given that many e-mail messages offer no cryptographic protections,
   the user needs to be able to detect which protections are present for
   any given message.

4.  Cryptographic MIME Message Structure

   Implementations use the structure of an e-mail message to protect the
   headers.  This section establishes some conventions about how to
   think about message structure.

4.1.  Cryptographic Layers

   "Cryptographic Layer" refers to a MIME substructure that supplies
   some cryptographic protections to an internal MIME subtree.  The
   internal subtree is known as the "protected part" though of course it
   may itself be a multipart object.

   In the diagrams below, "↧" (DOWNWARDS ARROW FROM BAR, U+21A7)
   indicates "decrypts to", and "⇩" (DOWNWARDS WHITE ARROW, U+21E9)
   indicates "unwraps to".

4.1.1.  S/MIME Cryptographic Layers

   For S/MIME [RFC8551], there are four forms of Cryptographic Layers:
   multipart/signed, PKCS#7 signed-data, PKCS7 enveloped-data, PKCS7
   authEnveloped-data.

4.1.1.1.  S/MIME Multipart Signed Cryptographic Layer

   └┬╴multipart/signed; protocol="application/pkcs7-signature"
    ├─╴[protected part]
    └─╴application/pkcs7-signature

   This MIME layer offers authentication and integrity.

4.1.1.2.  S/MIME PKCS7 signed-data Cryptographic Layer

   └─╴application/pkcs7-mime; smime-type="signed-data"
    ⇩ (unwraps to)
    └─╴[protected part]

   This MIME layer offers authentication and integrity.

Internet-Draft   Guidance on End-to-End E-mail Security     October 2020


4.1.1.3.  S/MIME PKCS7 enveloped-data Cryptographic Layer

   └─╴application/pkcs7-mime; smime-type="enveloped-data"
    ↧ (decrypts to)
    └─╴[protected part]

   This MIME layer offers confidentiality.

4.1.1.4.  S/MIME PKCS7 authEnveloped-data Cryptographic Layer

   └─╴application/pkcs7-mime; smime-type="authEnveloped-data"
    ↧ (decrypts to)
    └─╴[protected part]

   This MIME layer offers confidentiality and integrity.

   Note that "enveloped-data" (Section 4.1.1.3) and "authEnveloped-data"
   (Section 4.1.1.4) have identical message structure and semantics.
   The only difference between the two is ciphertext malleability.

   The examples in this document only include "enveloped-data", but the
   implications for that layer apply to "authEnveloped-data" as well.

4.1.1.5.  PKCS7 Compression is NOT a Cryptographic Layer

   The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) provides a MIME compression
   layer ("smime-type="compressed-data""), as defined in [RFC3274].
   While the compression layer is technically a part of CMS, it is not
   considered a Cryptographic Layer for the purposes of this document.

4.1.2.  PGP/MIME Cryptographic Layers

   For PGP/MIME [RFC3156] there are two forms of Cryptographic Layers,
   signing and encryption.

4.1.2.1.  PGP/MIME Signing Cryptographic Layer (multipart/signed)

   └┬╴multipart/signed; protocol="application/pgp-signature"
    ├─╴[protected part]
    └─╴application/pgp-signature

   This MIME layer offers authenticity and integrity.

4.1.2.2.  PGP/MIME Encryption Cryptographic Layer (multipart/encrypted)







Gillmor                    Expires 4 May 2021                   [Page 6]

Internet-Draft   Guidance on End-to-End E-mail Security     October 2020


   └┬╴multipart/encrypted
    ├─╴application/pgp-encrypted
    └─╴application/octet-stream
     ↧ (decrypts to)
     └─╴[protected part]

   Note that for PGP/MIME, this MIME layer can offer any of:

   *  confidentiality (via a Symmetrically Encrypted Data Packet, see
      Section 5.7 of [RFC4880]; a MUA MUST NOT generate this form due to
      ciphertext malleability)

   *  confidentiality and integrity (via a Symmetrically Encrypted
      Integrity Protected Data Packet (SEIPD), see section 5.13 of
      [RFC4880]), or

   *  confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity all together (by
      including an OpenPGP Signature Packet within the SEIPD).

4.2.  Cryptographic Envelope

   The Cryptographic Envelope is the largest contiguous set of
   Cryptographic Layers of an e-mail message starting with the outermost
   MIME type (that is, with the Content-Type of the message itself).

   If the Content-Type of the message itself is not a Cryptographic
   Layer, then the message has no cryptographic envelope.

   "Contiguous" in the definition above indicates that if a
   Cryptographic Layer is the protected part of another Cryptographic
   Layer, the layers together comprise a single Cryptographic Envelope.

   Note that if a non-Cryptographic Layer intervenes, all Cryptographic
   Layers within the non-Cryptographic Layer _are not_ part of the
   Cryptographic Envelope.  They are Errant Cryptographic Layers (see
   Section 4.5).

   Note also that the ordering of the Cryptographic Layers implies
   different cryptographic properties.  A signed-then-encrypted message
   is different than an encrypted-then-signed message.  See Section 5.2.

4.3.  Cryptographic Payload

   The Cryptographic Payload of a message is the first non-Cryptographic
   Layer - the "protected part" - within the Cryptographic Envelope.

4.4.  Types of Cryptographic Envelope

Internet-Draft   Guidance on End-to-End E-mail Security     October 2020


4.4.1.  Simple Cryptographic Envelopes

   As described above, if the "protected part" identified in the sction
   above is not itself a Cryptographic Layer, that part _is_ the
   Cryptographic Payload.

   If the application wants to generate a message that is both encrypted
   and signed, it MAY use the simple MIME structure from Section 4.1.2.2
   by ensuring that the [RFC4880] Encrypted Message within the
   "application/octet-stream" part contains an [RFC4880] Signed Message
   (the final option described in Section 4.1.2.2.

4.4.2.  Multilayer Cryptographic Envelopes

   It is possible to construct a Cryptographic Envelope consisting of
   multiple layers with either S/MIME or PGP/MIME , for example using
   the following structure:

   A └─╴application/pkcs7-mime; smime-type="enveloped-data"
   B  ↧ (decrypts to)
   C  └─╴application/pkcs7-mime; smime-type="signed-data"
   D   ⇩ (unwraps to)
   E   └─╴[protected part]

   When handling such a message, the properties of the Cryptographic
   Envelope are derived from the series "A", "C".

   As noted in Section 4.4.1, PGP/MIME applications also have a simpler
   MIME construction available with the same cryptographic properties.

4.5.  Errant Crytptographic Layers

   Due to confusion, malice, or well-intentioned tampering, a message
   may contain a Cryptographic Layer that is not part of the
   Cryptographic Envelope.  Such a layer is an Errant Cryptographic
   Layer.

   An Errant Cryptographic Layer SHOULD NOT contribute to the message's
   overall cryptographic state.

   Guidance for dealing with Errant Cryptographic Layers can be found in
   Section 6.2.

4.5.1.  Mailing List Wrapping

   Some mailing list software will re-wrap a well-formed signed message
   before re-sending to add a footer, resulting in the following
   structure seen by recipients of the e-mail:

Internet-Draft   Guidance on End-to-End E-mail Security     October 2020


   H └┬╴multipart/mixed
   I  ├┬╴multipart/signed
   J  │├─╴text/plain
   K  │└─╴application/pgp-signature
   L  └─╴text/plain

   In this message, "L" is the footer added by the mailing list.  "I" is
   now an Errant Cryptographic Layer.

   Note that this message has no Cryptographic Envelope at all.

   It is NOT RECOMMENDED to produce e-mail messages with this structure,
   because the data in part "L" may appear to the user as though it were
   part of "J", though they have different cryptographic properties.  In
   particular, if the user believes that the message is signed, but
   cannot distinguish "L" from "J" then the author of "L" can
   effectively tamper with content of the signed message, breaking the
   user's expectation of integrity and authenticity.

4.5.2.  A Baroque Example

   Consider a message with the following overcomplicated structure:

   M └┬╴multipart/encrypted
   N  ├─╴application/pgp-encrypted
   O  └─╴application/octet-stream
   P   ↧ (decrypts to)
   Q   └┬╴multipart/signed
   R    ├┬╴multipart/mixed
   S    │├┬╴multipart/signed
   T    ││├─╴text/plain
   U    ││└─╴application/pgp-signature
   V    │└─╴text/plain
   W    └─╴application/pgp-signature

   The 3 Cryptographic Layers in such a message are rooted in parts "M",
   "Q", and "S".  But the Cryptographic Envelope of the message consists
   only of the properties derived from the series "M", "Q".  The
   Cryptographic Payload of the message is part "R".  Part "S" is an
   Errant Cryptographic Layer.

   Note that this message has both a Cryptographic Envelope _and_ an
   Errant Cryptographic Layer.

Internet-Draft   Guidance on End-to-End E-mail Security     October 2020


   It is NOT RECOMMENDED to generate messages with such complicated
   structures.  Even if a receiving MUA can parse this structure
   properly, it is nearly impossible to render in a way that the user
   can reason about the cryptographic properties of part "T" compared to
   part "V".

5.  Message Composition

   This section describes the ideal composition of an e-mail message
   with end-to-end cryptographic protection.  A message composed with
   this form is most likely to achieve its end-to-end security goals.

5.1.  Message Composition Algorithm

   This section roughly describes the steps that a MUA should use to
   compose a cryptographically-protected message that has a proper
   cryptographic envelope and payload.

   The message composition algorithm takes three parameters:

   *  "origbody": the traditional unprotected message body as a well-
      formed MIME tree (possibly just a single MIME leaf part).  As a
      well-formed MIME tree, "origbody" already has structural headers
      present (see Section 1.2.1).

   *  "origheaders": the intended non-structural headers for the
      message, represented here as a table mapping from header names to
      header values.. For example, "origheaders['From']" refers to the
      value of the "From" header that the composing MUA would typically
      place on the message before sending it.

   *  "crypto": The series of cryptographic protections to apply (for
      example, "sign with the secret key corresponding to X.509
      certificate X, then encrypt to X.509 certificates X and Y").  This
      is a routine that accepts a MIME tree as input (the Cryptographic
      Payload), wraps the input in the appropriate Cryptographic
      Envelope, and returns the resultant MIME tree as output.

   The algorithm returns a MIME object that is ready to be injected into
   the mail system:

   *  Apply "crypto" to "origbody", yielding MIME tree "output"

   *  For header name "h" in "origheaders":

      -  Set header "h" of "output" to "origheaders[h]"

   *  Return "output"

Internet-Draft   Guidance on End-to-End E-mail Security     October 2020


5.2.  Encryption Outside, Signature Inside

   Users expect any message that is both signed and encrypted to be
   signed _inside_ the encryption, and not the other way around.

   Putting the signature inside the encryption has two advantages:

   *  The details of the signature remain confidential, visible only to
      the parties capable of decryption.

   *  Any mail transport agent that modifies the message is unlikely to
      be able to accidentally break the signature.

   A MUA SHOULD NOT generate an encrypted and signed message where the
   only signature is outside the encryption.

5.3.  Avoid Offering Encrypted-only Messages

   When generating an e-mail, the user has options about what forms of
   end-to-end cryptographic protections to apply to it.

   In some cases, offering any end-to-end cryptographic protection is
   harmful: it may confuse the recipient and offer no benefit.

   In other cases, signing a message is useful (authenticity and
   integrity are desirable) but encryption is either impossible (for
   example, if the sender does not know how to encrypt to all
   recipients) or meaningless (for example, an e-mail message to a
   mailing list that is intended to be be published to a public
   archive).

   In other cases, full end-to-end confidentiality, authenticity, and
   integrity are desirable.

   It is unclear what the use case is for an e-mail message with end-to-
   end confidentiality but without authenticity or integrity.

   A reasonable MUA will keep its message composition interface simple,
   so when presenting the user with a choice of cryptographic
   protection, it SHOULD offer no more than three choices:

   *  no end-to-end cryptographic protection

   *  signing-only

   *  signed and encrypted

5.4.  Composing a Reply Message

   When replying to a message, most MUAs compose an initial draft of the
   reply that contains quoted text from the original message.  A
   responsible MUA will take precautions to avoid leaking the cleartext
   of an encrypted message in such a reply.

   If the original message was end-to-end encrypted, the replying MUA
   MUST either:

   *  compose the reply with end-to-end encryption, or

   *  avoid including quoted text from the original message.

   In general, MUAs SHOULD prefer the first option: to compose an
   encrypted reply.  This is what users expect.

   However, in some circumstances, the replying MUA cannot compose an
   encrypted reply.  For example, the MUA might not have a valid,
   unexpired, encryption-capable certificate for all recipients.  This
   can also happen during composition when a user adds a new recipient
   into the reply, or manually toggles the cryptographic protections to
   remove encryption.

   In this circumstance, the composing MUA SHOULD strip the quoted text
   from the original message.

   Note additional nuance about replies to malformed messages that
   contain encryption in Section 6.2.2.1.

6.  Message Interpretation

   Despite the best efforts of well-intentioned senders to create e-mail
   messages with well-formed end-to-end cryptographic protection,
   receiving MUAs will inevitably encounter some messages with malformed
   end-to-end cryptographic protection.

   This section offers guidance on dealing with both well-formed and
   malformed messages containing Cryptographic Layers.

6.1.  Rendering Well-formed Messages

   A message is well-formed when it has a Cryptographic Envelope, a
   Cryptographic Payload, and no Errant Cryptographic Layers.  Rendering
   a well-formed message is straightforward.






Gillmor                    Expires 4 May 2021                  [Page 12]

Internet-Draft   Guidance on End-to-End E-mail Security     October 2020


   The receiving MUA should evaluate and summarize the cryptographic
   properties of the Cryptographic Envelope, and display that status to
   the user in a secure, strictly-controlled part of the UI.  In
   particular, the part of the UI used to render the cryptographic
   summary of the message MUST NOT be spoofable, modifiable, or
   otherwise controllable by the received message itself.

   Aside from this cryptographic summary, the message itself should be
   rendered as though the Cryptographic Payload is the body of the
   message.  The Cryptographic Layers themselves SHOULD not be rendered
   otherwise.

6.2.  Errant Cryptographic Layers

   If an incoming message has any Errant Cryptographic Layers, the
   interpreting MUA SHOULD ignore those layers when rendering the
   cryptographic summary of the message to the user.

6.2.1.  Errant Signing Layer

   When rendering a message with an Errant Cryptographic Layer that
   provides authenticity and integrity (via signatures), the message
   should be rendered by replacing the Cryptographic layer with the part
   it encloses.

   For example, a message with this structure:

   A └┬╴multipart/mixed
   B  ├╴text/plain
   C  ├┬╴multipart/signed
   D  │├─╴image/jpeg
   E  │└─╴application/pgp-signature
   F  └─╴text/plain

   Should be rendered identically to this:

   A └┬╴multipart/mixed
   B  ├─╴text/plain
   D  ├─╴image/jpeg
   F  └─╴text/plain

   In such a situation, an MUA SHOULD NOT indicate in the cryptographic
   summary that the message is signed.

6.2.1.1.  Exception: Mailing List Footers

   The use case described in Section 4.5.1 is common enough in some
   contexts, that a MUA MAY decide to handle it as a special exception.



Gillmor                    Expires 4 May 2021                  [Page 13]

Internet-Draft   Guidance on End-to-End E-mail Security     October 2020


   If the MUA determines that the message comes from a mailing list (it
   has a "List-ID" header), and it has a structure that appends a footer
   to a signing-only Cryptographic Layer with a valid signature, such
   as:

   H └┬╴multipart/mixed
   I  ├┬╴multipart/signed
   J  │├─╴[protected part, may be arbitrary MIME subtree]
   K  │└─╴application/{pgp,pkcs7}-signature
   L  └─╴[footer, typically text/plain]

   or:

   H └┬╴multipart/mixed
   I  ├─╴application/pkcs7-mime; smime-type="signed-data"
      │⇩ (unwraps to)
   J  │└─╴[protected part, may be an arbitrary MIME subtree]
   L  └─╴[footer, typically text/plain]

   Then, the MUA MAY indicate to the user that this is a signed message
   that has been wrapped by the mailing list.

   In this case, the MUA MUST distinguish the footer (part "L") from the
   protected part (part "J") when rendering any information about the
   signature.

   One way to do this is to offer the user two different views of the
   message: the "mailing list" view, which hides any cryptographic
   summary but shows the footer:

   Cryptographic Protections: none
   H └┬╴multipart/mixed
   J  ├─╴[protected part, may be arbitrary MIME subtree]
   L  └─╴[footer, typically text/plain]

   or the "sender's view", which shows the cryptographic summary but
   hides the footer:

   Cryptographic Protections: signed [details from part I]
   J └─╴[protected part, may be arbitrary MIME subtree]

6.2.2.  Errant Encryption Layer

   An MUA may encounter a message with an Errant Cryptographic Layer
   that offers confidentiality (encryption), and the MUA is capable of
   decrypting it.





Gillmor                    Expires 4 May 2021                  [Page 14]

Internet-Draft   Guidance on End-to-End E-mail Security     October 2020


   The user wants to be able to see the contents of any message that
   they receive, so an MUA in this situation SHOULD decrypt the part.

   In this case, though, the MUA MUST NOT indicate in the message's
   cryptographic summary that the message itself was encrypted.  Such an
   indication could be taken to mean that other (non-encrypted) parts of
   the message arrived with cryptographic confidentiality.

6.2.2.1.  Replying to a Message with an Errant Encryption Layer

   Note that there is an asymmetry here between rendering and replying
   to a message with an Errant Encryption Layer.

   When rendering, the MUA does not indicate that the message was
   encrypted, even if some subpart of it was decrypted for rendering.

   But when composing a reply that contains quoted text from the
   decrypted subpart, the reply message SHOULD be marked for encryption,
   as noted in {#composing-reply}.

   Alternately, if the reply message cannot be encrypted (or if the user
   elects to not encrypt the reply), the composed reply MUST NOT include
   any material from the decrypted subpart.

6.3.  Forwarded Messages with Cryptographic Protection

   An incoming e-mail message may include an attached forwarded message,
   typically as a MIME subpart with "Content-Type: message/rfc822"
   ([RFC5322]) or "Content-Type: message/global" ([RFC5355]).

   Regardless of the cryptographic protections and structure of the
   incoming message, the internal forwarded message may have its own
   Cryptographic Envelope.

   The Cryptographic Layers that are part of the Cryptographic Envelope
   of the forwarded message are not Errant Cryptographic Layers of the
   surrounding message - they are simply layers that apply to the
   forwarded message itself.

   The rendering MUA MUST NOT conflate the cryptographic protections of
   the forwarded message with the cryptographic protections of the
   incoming message.

   The rendering MUA MAY render a cryptograpic summary of the
   protections afforded to the forwarded message by its own
   Cryptographic Envelope, as long as that rendering is unambiguously
   tied to the forwarded message itself.

6.4.  Signature failures

   A cryptographic signature may fail in multiple ways.  A receiving MUA
   that discovers a failed signature should treat the message as though
   the signature did not exist.  This is similar to the standard
   guidance for about failed DKIM signatures (see section 6.1 of
   [RFC6376]).

   A MUA SHOULD NOT render a message with a failed signature as more
   dangerous or more dubious than a comparable message without any
   signature at all.

   A MUA that encounters an encrypted-and-signed message where the
   signature is invalid SHOULD treat the message the same way that it
   would treat a message that is encryption-only.

   Some different ways that a signature may be invalid on a given
   message:

   *  the signature is not cryptographically valid (the math fails).

   *  the signature relies on suspect cryptographic primitives (e.g.
      over a legacy digest algorithm, or was made by a weak key, e.g.,
      1024-bit R.SA)

   *  the signature is made by a certificate which the receiving MUA
      does not have access to.

   *  the certificate that made the signature was revoked.

   *  the certificate that made the signature was expired at the time
      that the signature was made.

   *  the certificate that made the signature does not correspond to the
      author of the message.

   *  the signature indicates that it was made at a time much before or
      much after from the date of the message itself.

   A valid signature must pass all these tests, but of course invalid
   signatures may be invalid in more than one of the ways listed above.

7.  Common Pitfalls and Guidelines

   This section highlights a few "pitfalls" and guidelines based on
   these discussions and lessons learned.

   FIXME: some possible additional commentary on:

   *  indexing and search of encrypted messages

   *  managing access to cryptographic secret keys that require user
      interaction

   *  secure deletion

   *  inline PGP, ugh

8.  IANA Considerations

   MAYBE: provide an indicator in the IANA header registry for which
   headers are "structural" ? This is probably unnecessary.

9.  Security Considerations

   This entire document addresses security considerations about end-to-
   end cryptographic protections for e-mail messages.
