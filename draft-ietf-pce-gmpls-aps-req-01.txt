   Internet Drafts         Reqs for GMPLS apps of PCE          July 2009 
1. Introduction 
 
   The initial effort of PCE WG is focused on solving the path 
   computation problem over different domains in MPLS networks. As the 
   same case with MPLS, service providers (SPs) have also come up with 
   requirements for path computation in GMPLS networks such as photonics, 
   TDM-based or Ethernet-based networks as well. 
    
   [PCE-ARCH] and [PCECP-REQ] discuss the framework and requirements for 
   PCE on both packet MPLS networks and (non-packet switch capable) 
   GMPLS networks. This document complements these documents by 
   providing some consideration of GMPLS applications in the intra-
   domain and inter-domain networking environments and indicating a set 
   of requirements for the extended definition of series of PCE related 
   protocols. 
 
   Constraint based shortest path first (CSPF) computation within a 
   domain or over domains for signaling GMPLS Label Switched Paths 
   (LSPs) is more stringent than that of MPLS LSPs [MPLS-AS], because 
   the additional constraints, e.g., interface switching capability, 
   link encoding, link protection capability and so forth need to be 
   considered to establish GMPLS LSPs [CSPF]. GMPLS signaling protocol 
   [RFC3471, RFC3473] is designed taking into account bi-directionality, 
   switching type, encoding type, SRLG, and protection attributes of the 
   TE links spanned by the path, as well as LSP encoding and switching 
   type for the end points, appropriately. 
 
   This document provides the investigated results of GMPLS applications 
   of PCE for the support of GMPLS path computation. This document also 
   provides requirements for GMPLS applications of PCE in the GMPLS 
   intra-domain and inter-domain environments.

   3.1 GMPLS network model 
    
   Figure 1 depicts a typical network, consisting of several GMPLS 
   domains, assumed in this document. D1, D2, D3 and D4 have multiple 
   GMPLS inter-domain connections, and D5 has only one GMPLS inter-
   domain connection. These domains follow the definition in [RFC4726].

   Each domain is configured using various switching and link 
   technologies defined in [Arch] and an end-to-end route needs to 
   respect TE link attributes like switching capability, encoding type, 
   etc., making the problem a bit different from the case of classical 
   (packet) MPLS. In order to route from one GMPLS domain to another 
   GMPLS domain appropriately, each domain manages traffic engineering 
   database (TED) by PCE, and exchanges or provides route information of 
   paths, while concealing its internal topology information. 
    
   3.2 Path computation in GMPLS network 
    
   [CSPF] describes consideration of GMPLS TE attributes during path 
   computation.

   For the simplicity in consideration, the below basic assumptions are 
   made when the LSP is created. 
    
        (1) Switching capabilities of outgoing links from the ingress 
            and egress nodes (link1-2 and link4-3 in Figure 2) must be 
            consistent with each other. 
        (2) Switching capabilities of all transit links including 
            incoming links to the ingress and egress nodes (link2-1 and 
            link3-4) should be consistent with switching type of a LSP 
            to be created. 
        (3) Encoding-types of all transit links should be consistent 
            with encoding type of a LSP to be created. 
    
   [CSPF] indicates the possible table of switching capability, encoding 
   type and bandwidth at the ingress link, transiting links and the 
   egress link which need to be satisfied with the created LSP. 
 
   The non-packet GMPLS networks (e.g., TDM networks) are usually 
   responsible for transmitting data for the client layer. These GMPLS

   networks can provide different types of connections for customer 
   services based on different service bandwidth requests.  
    
   The applications and the corresponding additional requirements for 
   applying PCE in non-packet networks, for example, GMPLS-based TDM 
   networks, are described in Figure 3. In order to simplify the 
   description, this document just discusses the scenario in SDH 
   networks as an example. The scenarios in SONET or G.709 ODUk layer 
   networks are similar.

   Figure 3 shows a simple network topology, where N1, N2, N3, N4, and 
   N5 are all SDH switches. Assume that one Ethernet service with 100M 
   bandwidth is required from A1 to A2 over this network. The client 
   Ethernet service could be provided by a VC4 connection from N1 to N4, 
   and it could also be provided by three concatenated VC3 connections 
   (Contiguous or Virtual concatenation) from N1 to N4.  
    
   The type of connection(s) (one VC4 or three concatenated VC3) that is 
   required needs to be specified by PCC (e.g., N1 or NMS), but could 
   also be determined by PCE automatically based on policy [RFC5394]. 
    
   Therefore, the signal type, the type of the concatenation and the 
   number of the concatenation should also be considered during path 
   computation for PCE. 
    
4. Requirement for GMPLS application of PCE 
 
   In this section, we describe requirements for GMPLS applications of 
   PCE in order to establish GMPLS LSP. 
    
   4.1 PCE requirements

   Internet Drafts         Reqs for GMPLS apps of PCE          July 2009 
   As for path computation in GMPLS networks as discussed in section 3, 
   the PCE needs to consider the GMPLS TE attributes appropriately 
   according to tables in [CSPF] once a PCC or another PCE requests a 
   path computation. Indeed, the path calculation request message from 
   the PCC or the PCE needs to contain the information specifying 
   appropriate attributes. Additional attributes to those already 
   defined in [PCECP] are as follows. 
    
        (1) Switching capability: PSC1-4, L2SC, TDM, LSC, FSC 
        (2) Encoding type: as defined in [RFC4202], [RFC4203], e.g., 
            Ethernet, SONET/SDH, Lambda, etc. 
        (3) Signal Type: Indicates the type of elementary signal that        
            constitutes the requested LSP. A lot of signal types with        
            different granularity have been defined in SONET/SDH and 
            G.709 ODUk, such as VC11, VC12, VC2, VC3 and VC4 in SDH, and 
            ODU1, ODU2 and ODU3 in G.709 ODUk. See [RFC4606] and 
            [RFC4328]. 
        (4) Concatenation Type: In SDH/SONET and G.709 ODUk networks, 
            two kinds of concatenation modes are defined: contiguous     
            concatenation which requires co-route for each member signal 
            and requires all the interfaces along the path to support 
            this capability, and virtual concatenation which allows 
            diverse routes for the member signals and only requires the 
            ingress and egress interfaces to support this capability. 
            Note that for the virtual concatenation, it also may specify 
            co-routed or separated-routed. See [RFC4606] and [RFC4328] 
            about Concatenation information. 
        (5) Concatenation Number: Indicates the number of signals that 
            are requested to be contiguously or virtually concatenated. 
            Also see [RFC4606] and [RFC4328]. 
        (6) Wavelength Label: as defined in [Lambda-label] 
        (7) e2e Path protection type: as defined in [RFC4872], e.g., 1+1 
            protection, 1:1 protection, (pre-planned) rerouting, etc. 
        (8) Administrative group: as defined in [RFC3630] 
        (9) Link Protection type: as defined in [RFC4203] 
         
    
   4.2 PCC requirements 
    
   As described above, a PCC needs to support to initiate path 
   computation request specifying abovementioned attributes. Afterwards, 
   GMPLS signaling will be invoked according to the responded messages 
   from the PCE. 
    
   4.3 GMPLS PCE Management 
 
   PCE related Management Information Bases need to consider extensions 
   to be satisfied with requirements for GMPLS applications. For 
   extensions, [GMPLS-TEMIB] are defined to manage TE database and may 
   be referred to accommodate GMPLS TE attributes in the PCE.

   PCE extensions to support GMPLS should be considered under the same 
   security as current work. This extension will not change the 
   underlying security issues.

8. Intellectual Property 
 
   The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any 
   Intellectual Property Rights or other rights that might be claimed to 
   pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in 
   any IETF Document or the extent to which any license under such 
   rights might or might not be available; nor does it represent that it 
   has made any independent effort to identify any such rights. 
 
   Copies of Intellectual Property disclosures made to the IETF 
   Secretariat and any assurances of licenses to be made available, or 
   the result of an attempt made to obtain a general license or 
   permission for the use of such proprietary rights by implementers or 
   users of this specification can be obtained from the IETF on-line IPR 
   repository at http://www.ietf.org/ipr. 
    
   The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any 
   copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary 
   rights that may cover technology that may be required to implement 
   this standard or specification contained in an IETF Document. Please 
   address the information to the IETF at ietf-ipr@ietf.org. 
    
   The definitive version of an IETF Document is that published by, or 
   under the auspices of, the IETF. Versions of IETF Documents that are 
   published by third parties, including those that are translated into 
   other languages, should not be considered to be definitive versions 
   of IETF Documents. The definitive version of these Legal Provisions 
   is that published by, or under the auspices of, the IETF. Versions of 
   these Legal Provisions that are published by third parties, including 
   those that are translated into other languages, should not be 
   considered to be definitive versions of these Legal Provisions.  
    
   For the avoidance of doubt, each Contributor to the IETF Standards 
   Process licenses each Contribution that he or she makes as part of 
   the IETF Standards Process to the IETF Trust pursuant to the 
   provisions of RFC 5378. No language to the contrary, or terms, 
   conditions or rights that differ from or are inconsistent with the 
   rights and licenses granted under RFC 5378, shall have any effect and 
   shall be null and void, whether published or posted by such 
   Contributor, or included with or in such Contribution.
