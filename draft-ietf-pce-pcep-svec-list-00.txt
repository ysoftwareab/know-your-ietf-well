 Abstract 

     A Path Computation Element (PCE) performing dependent path 
    computations, for instance calculating a diverse working and 
    protected path do not share common network points, would need to 
    synchronize the computations in order to increase the probability 
    of meeting the working and protected path disjoint objective and 
    network resource optimization objective. When a PCE computes 
    multiple sets of dependent path computation requests concurrently, 
    it is required to use Synchronization VECtor (SVEC) list for 
    association among the sets of dependent path computation requests. 
    This document describes the usage of multiple SVECs in the SVEC 
    list and its processing guideline, for the synchronized computation 
    of dependent paths.

 2. Introduction 

    [ID.pce-pcep] describes the specifications for PCEP (Path 
    Computation Element communication Protocol). PCEP facilitates the 
    communication between a Path Computation Client(PCC) and a Path 
    Computation Element (PCE), or between two PCEs based on PCE

    architecture [RFC4655]. PCEP interactions include path computation 
    requests and path computation replies. 

     [ID.pce-gco] specifies a global concurrent path computation   
     application for the efficient use of network resources, called GCO, 
     based on required objective functions (OFs). To compute a set of 
     traffic-engineered paths for the GCO application, PCEP supports 
     the synchronous and dependent path computation requests required 
     in [RFC4657]. When a PCC or PCE sends such path computation 
     requests to a PCE, Synchronization VECtor (SVEC) allows the PCC or 
     PCE to specify a list of multiple path computation requests that 
     must be synchronized along with a potential dependency.[ID.pce-
     pcep] defines two synchronous path computation modes using SVEC. 

     o  Bundle of a set of independent and synchronized path 
         computation requests, 

     o  Bundle of a set of dependent and synchronized path computation 
         requests. 

      These are exclusive modes. If one of the dependency flags (i.e. 
      Node, Link or Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLG) diverse flags) in a 
      SVEC is set, the SVEC indicates a set of synchronous path    
      computation requests with a dependency. In order to be 
      synchronized among multiple sets of path computation requests 
      with a dependency, it is necessary to use other SVECs. 

      It is important for the PCE, when performing path computations, 
      to synchronize any path computation requests with a dependency. 
      For example, consider a protected end-to-end service. Two diverse 
      path computation requests are needed to compute the disjointed 
      working and protected paths. If the diverse path requests are 
      computed sequentially, fulfillment of the initial diverse path 
      computation without consideration of the second diverse path 
      computation and disjoint constraint, may result in the PCE 
      providing sub-optimal results for the second one, or fail to meet 
      the disjoint requirement altogether. 

     This document defines the handling of synchronous path 
     computation for PCE and multiple set of path computation request 
     with a dependency. The following scenarios are specifically 
     described: 

      o  Single domain, single PCE, dependent and synchronized path 
         computation request. 

      o  Multi-domain, multiple-PCE, dependent and synchronized path 
         computation request.

      The association among multiple SVECs and the processing rules to 
      support multiple sets of synchronized dependent path computation 
      requests is also described in this document. Path computation 
      algorithms for the associated path computation requests are out 
      of scope in this document. 

      The SVEC association and its processing rule do not require any 
      extension to PCEP message and object formats, when computing a 
      GCO for multiple diverse paths. In addition, the use of multiple 
      SVECs is not restricted to only SRLG, Node and Link diversity 
      currently defined in the SVEC object, [ID.pce-pcep], but is also 
      available for other dependent path computation requests. 

      The SVEC association is available to both multiple PCE path 
      computations as well as a single PCE path computation. 

       

 3. SVEC association scenarios 

    This section clarifies several path computation scenarios, in 
    which SVEC association can be applied. Also, any combination of 
    scenarios described in this section could be applicable. 

 3.1. Synchronized computation for diverse path requests 

    When computing two or more point-to-point diverse paths, a PCE may 
    compute these diverse paths concurrently, in order to increase the 
    probability of meeting primary and secondary path disjoint 
    objective and network resource optimization objective. 

    Two scenarios can be considered for the SVEC association of point-
    to-point diverse paths. 

    o Two or more end-to-end diverse paths 

       When concurrent path computation of two or more end-to-end 
       diverse paths is requested, SVEC association is needed among 
       diverse path requests. Note here that each diverse path request 
       consists of primary, secondary, and etc., in which are grouped 
       with one SVEC.  

       Example of this scenario: When there are two associated end-to-
       end diverse path requests with primary and secondary, all 
       requests must be computed in a synchronized manner.  

    o End-to-end primary path and its segmented secondary paths 


  
  
 Nishioka & King         Expires March 29, 2009                 [Page 5] 
    
 Internet-Draft      draft-ietf-pce-pcep-svec-list-00     September 2008 
     
      When concurrent path computation of an end-to-end primary path 
      and several segmented secondary paths is requested, SVEC 
      association is needed among primary/segmented secondary-1 
      request, primary/segmented secondary-2 request, and etc.  

      In this scenario, we assume that the primary path may be pre-
      computed, which is used for specifying the segment for secondary 
      paths. Otherwise, segment for secondary path requests are 
      specified in advance, by using XRO and/or IOR constraints in the 
      primary request. 

 3.2. Synchronized computation for point-to-multipoint path requests 

    For point-to-multipoint path requests, SVEC association can be 
    applied.  

     o Two or more point-to-multipoint paths 

       If a point-to-multipoint paths request is represented as a set 
       of point-to-point paths [ID.pce-p2mp-ext], two or more point-to-
       multipoint path computation requests can be associated for 
       concurrent path computation, in order to optimize network 
       resources. 

     o point-to-multipoint paths and its secondary paths 

       When concurrent path computation of a point-to-multipoint path 
       and its point-to-point secondary paths [RFC4875], or a point-to- 
       multipoint path and its point-to-multipoint secondary paths 
       [ID.p2mp-te-bypass] is requested, SVEC association is needed 
       among these requests. 

       In this scenario, we use the same assumption as "end-to-end 
       primary path and its segmented secondary paths scenario" in 
       section 3.1 

  

 4. Association among SVEC 

    This section describes the associations among SVECs in a SVEC list. 

 4.1. Association among SVEC 

     Associated SVECs mean that there are relationships among multiple 
     SVECs. Request-IDs in the SVEC objects are used to indicate the 
     association among SVEC objects. If the same request-IDs exist in 
     more than two SVECs, this indicates associated SVECs. When 

  
  
 Nishioka & King         Expires March 29, 2009                 [Page 6] 
    
 Internet-Draft      draft-ietf-pce-pcep-svec-list-00     September 2008 
     
     associating among SVECs, only one request-ID may in the SVEC 
     object may be contained in the other SVEC object. This contributes 
     to reducing the message size of PCEP request. Even in this case, 
     all of the path computation requests are synchronized. 

     Below is an example of associated SVECs. In this example the first 
     SVEC and the other SVECs are associated, and path computation 
     requests from Request-ID#1 to Request-ID#Z must be synchronized. 

    <SVEC-list> 

        <SVEC> without dependency flags 

         Request-ID #1, Request-ID #3, Request-ID #4..., Request-ID #X 

        <SVEC> with one or more dependency flags  

         Request-ID #1, Request-ID #2 

        <SVEC> with one or more dependency flags 

         Request-ID #4, Request-ID #5 

           ........ 

        <SVEC> without dependency flag 

         Request-ID #X, Request-ID #Y, Request-ID #Z 

     Note that path computation requests that do not have other SVECs, 
     like Request-ID #3, may be contained in the associated SVEC. This 
     request is also synchronized. 

 4.2. Non-associated SVECs 

     Non-associated SVECs mean that there are no relationships among 
     SVECs. If SVEC objects in PECP request messages do not have the 
     same request-ID, the relationship among these SVECs is not 
     associated. Below is an example of non-associated SVECs that does 
     not contain any same request-IDs. 

     <SVEC-list> 

        <SVEC> with one or more dependency flags  

         Request-ID #1, Request-ID #2 

         <SVEC> with one or more dependency flags

            ........ 

         <SVEC> without dependency flags 

         Request-ID #X, Request-ID #Y, Request-ID #Z 

 5. Processing of SVEC list 

 5.1. Single PCE, single domain environments 

     When PCEP receives PCReq messages with more than two SVEC objects 
     in the SVEC list, PCEP has to first check the request-IDs in all 
     SVEC objects in order to identify any associations among them. The 
     SVEC objects may be received in a single or multiple PCReq 
     message(s). In the later case, the PCE may start a SyncTimer as 
     recommended in [ID.pce-pcep]. After receiving the whole path 
     computation requests, the analysis for associated SVECs has to be 
     started. 

     If there are no matching request-IDs in the different SVEC objects,   
     these SVEC objects are not associated, and then each set of path   
     computation requests in the non-associated SVEC objects has to be   
     computed separately.  

    If there are matching request-IDs in the different SVEC objects, 
    these SVEC objects are associated, and then all path computation 
    requests in the associated SVEC objects are treated in a 
    synchronous manner for GCO application. 

    If the PCE does not have capability to handle the associated SVEC 
    objects, it may send a PCErr message with Error-Type="Capability 
    not supported". 

     

 5.2. Multi-PCE, single domain environments 

     Currently no mechanisms exist to manage co-ordination of dependent 
     SVEC requests between multiple PCE`s in the same domain. If a PCC 
     sends a path computation request to a PCE and then sends a second 
     service path computation request, which is required to be disjoint 
     from the first service, and this request is sent to a different 
     PCE in the domain, no SVEC object correlation function between the 
     PCEs is currently available. Equally, associated SVECs are not 
     sent to the different PCEs in the domain.

 Internet-Draft      draft-ietf-pce-pcep-svec-list-00     September 2008 
     
      

 5.3. Multi-PCE, multi-domain environments 

     When more than two PCEs are used to concurrently compute a 
     protected end-to-end path across multiple domains, additional 
     processing may be required. If the PCReq message contains multiple 
     associated SVEC objects and these SVEC objects contain path 
     computation requests that will be sent to the next PCE along the 
     path computation chain. Intermediate PCEs receiving such PCReq 
     messages may re-construct associations among SVEC objects, and 
     then send PCReq messages to corresponding next PCEs. If the 
     associated SVECs are re-constructed at the intermediate PCE, the 
     PCE must not start path computation until all PCRep messages are 
     received from neighbor PCEs. In addition, it is not recommended 
     that SVEC objects coming from different PCReq messages are re-
     constructed. This may contribute to resource optimization from 
     network operator`s point of view, but it is unrealistic in the 
     case of multiple PCE path computation. 

      

 6. Manageability considerations 

    This section describes manageability considerations specified in 
    [ID.pce-mngabl-reqs]. 

 6.1. Control of Function and Policy 

    In addition to section 8.1 to [ID.pce-pcep], PCEP implementation   
    should allow the configuration of association among SVECs on PCCs.    

    o  the capability to configure SVEC association. 

 6.2. Information and Data Models, e.g. MIB modules 

     There are no additional parameters for MIB modules. 

 6.3. Liveness Detection and Monitoring 

    The associated SVEC in this document allows PCEs to compute 
    optimal sets of diverse path. This type of path computation may 
    require more time to obtain its results. Therefore, it is 
    recommended for PCEP to support PCE monitoring mechanism specified 
    in [ID.pce-monitor].

 6.4. Verifying Correct Operation 

    Section 8.4 in [ID.pce-pcep] provides the sufficient descriptions 
    for this document. So, there are no additional considerations. 

 6.5. Requirements on Other Protocols and Functional Components 

    This document does not require anything on other protocol and 
    functional components. 

 6.6. Impact on Network Operation 

    Section 8.6 in [ID.pce-pcep] provides the sufficient descriptions 
    for this document. So, there are no additional considerations. 

     

 7. Security Considerations 

    This document defines the usage of SVEC list, and does not have 
    any extensions for PCEP protocol. Therefore the security of this 
    document depends on that of PCEP protocol. 

     

 8. IANA Considerations 

    This document has no specific extension for PCEP messages, objects 
    and its parameters and does not require any registry assignment.
