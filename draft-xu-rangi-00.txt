   addressing architecture, called Routing Architecture for the Next Generation 
   Internet (RANGI) as a solution to the problems of scalability, mobility, 
   multihoming, and traffic engineering. RANGI is a hybrid proposal that combines and 
   enhances the ideas from several proposals particularly those based on 
   identifier/locator split approach. It introduces a hierarchical and cryptographic 
   host identifier and adopts a hierarchical routing mechanism to support routing 
   across multiple independent address spaces. To allow smooth transition from IPv4 
   to IPv6, it adopts an IPv6 address with an IPv4 embedded in the last four bytes as 
   locator. This also simplifies renumbering in case of change of service providers. 
   RANGI allows traffic engineering by allowing border routers to overwrite the 
   source addresses. It allows policy control on ID to address translation by having 
   a hierarchical resolution mechanism.

Internet-Draft    A Transition Mechanism for RANGI          March 2009 
    

1. Introduction 

   The Internet routing table size is growing at a rate which exceeds the speed of 
   the hardware improvement. This issue has drawn significant attention from both 
   industry and academia. After much discussion following the IAB Routing and 
   Addressing workshop [1] in Amsterdam, a common conclusion was reached that the 
   explosive growth in Internet routing table is caused mainly by the wide adoption 
   of multi-homing, traffic engineering and provider-independent addressing. The 
   underlying reason for the routing scalability issue is the overlapping semantics 
   of IP address which is used both as locator and identifier in current Internet. 
   This contextual overloading of IP address makes it impossible to renumber the 
   addresses in a topologically aggregatable way. This is the so-called routing 
   scalability issue. 

   At present, the IRTF Routing Research Group (RRG) is chartered to explore a new 
   routing and addressing architecture to meet those challenges that the current 
   Internet is facing, especially in scalability, mobility, multi-homing, and inter-
   domain traffic engineering.  

   This internet draft describes a hybrid solution called Routing Architecture for 
   the Next Generation Internet (RANGI) that significantly enhances id/locator split 
   approaches. It introduces a hierarchical and cryptographic host identifier and 
   adopts a hierarchical routing mechanism to support routing across multiple 
   independent address spaces. RANGI's use of 128-bit host IDs (which also look like 
   IPv6 addresses) allows current IPv6 applications to run over RANGI. Using IPv4 
   addresses embedded in the IPv6 locators ease the transition from IPv4 to IPv6. 
   Traffic engineering and policy control is provided by allowing border routers to 
   overwrite the addresses in the outgoing packets. 

   It has recently become clear that hosts IDs have to be separated from their point 
   of attachment (addresses). In other words, the network consists of two tiers -                                                                      - 
   hosts and infrastructure. We have generalized this to a multi-tier virtualizable 
   architecture where users and data form higher tiers of the architecture over the 
   host and infrastructure. We are designing a general architecture for this multi-
   tiered next generation Internet [20-24].  RANGI as described here is limited to 
   just the bottom two tiers and applies to the current Internet 

2. RANGI: Concepts and Definitions 

   2.1. Administrative Domains and Locator Domains 

   In RANGI, we distinguish between the infrastructure and the hosts. Infrastructure 
   is organized as a set of locator domains while the hosts are organized as a set of 
   administrative domains. In the current Internet hosts ID is merged with the ID of 
   the point of attachment to the network.  We separate these two. Administrative 
   domain is the set of all hosts belonging to a single organization. Locator domain 
   is the set of infrastructure point of attachments.

   2.2. Identifiers and Locators 

   In the ID/Locator split paradigm, it is a general tendency to refer to an 
  "identifier" as "host id", and "locator" as "host address". However both of these 
   need to be bound to a context."Identifier" in RANGI refers to the "host ID" in 
   the context of the administrative domain while "locators" in RANGI are defined in 
   the context of the locator domain.  

   2.3. PI and PA locators 

   Synonymous to provider independent (PI) and Provider aggregatable (PA) addresses, 
   RANGI too has the concept of PI and PA locators. The 96 bit LD ID of RANGI 
   locators is used as a prefix in RANGI routing similar to the prefix based routing 
   of IPv4 and IPv6. Providers may be assigned multiple /96 locator blocks and 
   reassign them in smaller chunks to subscribers. One of the key features of RANGI 
   is that it tries to eliminate the concept of PI locator assignments. RANGI tries 
   to package all the benefits of PI locators using PA locators. Also, with an added 
   layer of indirection of immutable host IDs, PI locator assignments may be 
   considerably reduced in RANGI, thus considerably reducing the scalability problems 
   of the current Internet routing. 

   2.4. Host Identifiers 

   Similar to HIP [5], RANGI uses a 128-bit hierarchical Host Identifier (HI), 
   composed of two parts as shown in Figure 1. The first part is an Administrative 
   Domain (AD) ID which has embedded organizational affiliation and global uniqueness, 
   and the second part is a hash value of the AD ID and the public key. The global 
   uniqueness of the HI should be guaranteed through some registration mechanism. 
   Since the AD ID is globally unique and controlled by the host ID registration and 
   administrative authorities from different countries, the second part of the HI, 
   the hash value just needs to be unique within the AD scope. 

                                                                        
          +--------------------------+-----------------+                
          | Administrative Domain ID |   Local Host ID |

          |                            \                                
          |                              \                              
          |                                \                            
          |                                   \                         
          |                                      \

   The purpose of the hierarchical host identifier in RANGI is to ease the management 
   of the global identifier namespace and hold the economic and trust model in the 
   id/locator mapping system. In the example shown in Figure 1, the purpose of the 
   Authority ID field in the AD ID is to benefit the market competition among 
   multiple ID registration and administrative authorities.  

   The business model of this ID registration and administration is similar to that 
   of the Domain Name Service (DNS). The owner of the ID should pay for the ID 
   administration and the corresponding ID/Locator mapping service. 

   Generation of the hierarchical host identifiers is similar to the generation of 
   Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) [6]. In CGA, the process of generating 
   a new CGA takes three input values: a 64-bit subnet prefix, the public key of the 
   address owner as a DER-encoded ASN.1 structure of the type SubjectPublicKeyInfo 
   and the security parameter Sec, which is an unsigned three-bit integer. In RANGI, 
   the process of generating a new HI also takes three input values: the n-bit AD ID 
   (the suitable value of "n" has not been determined), the public key and the 
   security parameter Sec. 

   2.5. Host Locators 

   A RANGI locator is a specific IPv6 address with an IPv4 address embedded in the 
   last 4 octets. As shown in Figure 2, the first 96 bits of the locator are "Locator 
   Domain Identifier" (LD ID). This part can be used to globally uniquely identify 
   each LD and it is a provider-assigned (PA) /96 IPv6 prefix. The LD ID has a 
   hierarchical structure for topological aggregation (e.g., in CIDR style). The 
   second part is an IPv4 address. This IPv4 address just needs to be unique within 
   the LD scope.  

                                      
              |<------- 96 bits -------->|<---- 32 bits--->| 
              +--------------------------+-----------------+ 
              |         LD ID            |       IPv4      | 
              +--------------------------+-----------------+ 
                                      
                     Figure 2. Host Locator Structure. 
    
 
   The proposed RANGI locator is designed to allow easy transition from IPv4 networks 
   to IPv6 networks. Today's networks are mostly IPv4 based and the transition to 
   IPv6 is slower than expected. However, IPv6 hosts exist in the current Internet. 
   It is important to accept the fact that the Internet cannot change from IPv4 to 
   IPv6 on a single day. The hierarchical RANGI locator structure depicted as in 
   Figure 2 can make this transition process easier.

   2.6. ID Sublayer 

   All host based services connect using host IDs.  Hence, for performing these 
   services, RANGI introduces a new RANGI ID sublayer in the network layer of the 
   current host protocol stack. The introduction of this sublayer serves two primary 
   purposes: 

   1. It implements the end-host responsibilities of the distributed host 
   administrative domain functions. 

   2. It de-couples the concerns of a logical end-to-end connectivity over host 
   administrative domains from the concerns of physical end-to-end connectivity over 
   locator domains. 

   The separation of logical connectivity/physical connectivity concerns has huge 
   implications on the flexibility and functionality of the Internet.  In the context 
   of RANGI, logical connections over immutable host IDs are shielded from locator 
   changes as a result of host mobility or multi-homing.  Also, a logical link can 
   accrue attributes of security, trust and reliability through inter-administrative 
   domain negotiations during connection-setup.  

   2.7. Packet Format 

   RANGI-aware hosts reuse IPv6 protocol stack and packet format. The RANGI sublayer 
   information (host identifier) simply appears as a Next Header in the IPv6 packet 
   (as shown in Figure 3), whereas the locator is filled as the IPv6 address in the 
   IPv6 header (as shown in Figure 4). The routers process and forward these RANGI 
   packets as ordinary IPv6 packets.

3. RANGI: Assumptions 

   The following are the assumptions of the operational environment of RANGI. 

    

   1. Hosts: All hosts in RANGI domains are basically IPv6 hosts that are RANGI-aware. 
   Each host has an IPv4 local address and a set of IPv6 global addresses. The term 
   "local" means that this address is routable only within the precincts of the 
   legacy IPv4 routing domain. Each RANGI-aware host also has a 128 bit global ID and 
   IPv6 aware higher layer protocols. The RANGI-aware hosts are capable of supporting 
   IPv6 over IPv4 tunnels. 

   2. Border Routers: Border routers have similar requirements as that of RANGI hosts 
   and all border routers support IPv6. Additional border router specific 
   requirements include being able to setup IPv6 based BGP sessions with other border 
   routers.  Border routers in RANGI are also called "Locator Domain Border Routers"                                                                          
   or LDBRs.

   3. Core (non-border) Routers: The core routers stand between RANGI hosts and their 
   LDBRs (or between LDBRs) and may be IPv4 or IPv6 routers. Generally in the first 
   phase of RANGI deployment, core routers need not change. As core routers upgrade 
   to IPv6 over time, RANGI becomes more efficient operationally. Till then RANGI 
   depends on IPv6 over IPv4 tunneling mechanisms to interoperate with IPv4 core 
   routers. 

4. RANGI: Architecture Description 

   4.1. ID/Locator Mapping Resolution 

   ID/locator split implies a need for storing and distributing the mapping of 
   identifiers and locators. 

   Within RANGI, the mappings of host name and HI are stored in the DNS system, while 
   the mappings of HI and locator are stored in a distributed id/locator mapping 
   system (e.g., a hierarchical Distributed Hash Table (DHT) system, or a reverse DNS 
   system.). 

   When we use hierarchical DHT as the mapping system, we need to use the AD ID 
   (first 96 bits of the Host ID) as a key in the top-level DHT ring to determine the 
   corresponding bottom-level DHT ring. Then we use the hash part (the last 32 bits 
   of the Host ID) as a key to determine the corresponding peer which stores the key 
   value pair. Of course, the top-level DHT ring can be split further into multiple 
   levels since the AD ID itself has hierarchical structure. 

   The resolution infrastructure for the flat host identifier has no "pay-for-your-
   own" model, as the flat names are stored at essentially random nodes. On the 
   contrary, the resolution infrastructure for the hierarchical host identifier, as 
   used in RANGI, has reasonable business and trust model, since the hierarchical 
   host identifier has clear organization affiliation and so the identifier resource 
   can be managed with clear administrative boundaries. 

   4.2. Routing and Forwarding System 

   Within RANGI, LDs are connected via Locator Domain Border Routers (LDBRs). A LDBR 
   has at least one locally unique IPv4 address in each LD to which it is connected. 
   The adjacent LDBRs exchange LD ID or LD prefix (The LD ID can be aggregated into 
   LD prefix) reachability information with an inter-LD routing protocol. In fact, 
   the BGP for IPv6 address family can be used directly as the inter-LD routing 
   protocol with the prefix length being shorter than /96. 

   4.2.1. Host Behavior 

   Generally, a source host will obtain the locator of the destination host from the 
   ID/locator mapping system before initializing a communication with the destination 
   host. If the LD of the source host is the same as that of the destination host,

Internet-Draft    A Transition Mechanism for RANGI          March 2009 
    

   the source host will send the packets directly to the destination host via an IPv6 
   over IPv4 tunnel. Otherwise, the source host will forward the packets towards the 
   local LDBR via an IPv6 over IPv4 tunnel. 

   Hosts can get their local LDBR information in some ways, for example, a new 
   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) option can be used to convey this 
   information, or a well-known LD-scope anycast address can be allocated to the 
   local LDBRs. 

   4.2.2. LDBR Behavior 

   LDBRs establish MP-BGP session among them so as to exchange LD reachability 
   information. In fact, the LD reachability information is IPv6 routing information 
   and the IPv6 prefix mask length is less than /96. LDBR can forward IPv6 packets on 
   the basis of the LD ID part (first 96 bits) of the special IPv6 address over IPv4 
   tunnel.  

   4.2.3. Non-LDBR Router Behavior 

   There is hardly any additional requirement on the Non-LDBR routers. So there is no 
   need for these internal routers to be upgraded. These non-LDBR routers just need 
   to support IPv4 forwarding capability. 

   4.2.4. Forwarding Procedure 

   RANGI introduces a two-level routing structure which is composed of LD ID based 
   routing and IP address based routing. The former is used for inter-LD routing 
   while the latter is used for intra-LD routing.  

   A simple RANGI routing procedure is illustrated in Figure 5. Before host A sends 
   out the packet, it looks up the current locator of the remote host B through the 
   ID/Locator mapping system. After it gets the RANGI locator of the remote host, it 
   will tunnel the packets to its local LDBR. The LDBR shall find the next hop LDBR 
   based on the IPv6 global routable locator, and forward the packets to it. For the 
   intermediate transit networks, if the core routers are legacy IPv4 and if the 
   packet needs to traverse over them, the ingress LDBR (for that locator domain) 
   tunnels the packet to the egress LDBR of the same locator domain in IPv6 over IPv4 
   tunnels.

                        Figure 5. Routing Procedure 
 

   For the intra-LD routing, RANGI uses the IPv6-over-IPv4 tunneling between LDBRs 
   (or between LDBRs and hosts). This usage of IPv6-over-IPv4 tunneling looks more 
   like the usage of the MAC addresses between routers in current Internet (although 
   they are not exactly the same). That's to say, the IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnel plays the 
   role of the link-layer inside an LD (between two LDBRs or between LDBRs and hosts). 
   By doing so, RANGI can achieve a smooth IPv4/IPv6 transition. Once the internal 
   routers within LD are upgraded to IPv6, the requirement of IPv6 over IPv4 tunnel 
   between the LDBRs or between LDBRs and hosts will be eliminated and the packets 
   will be delivered by the LDBRs and the internal IPv6 routers hop by hop without 
   tunneling as shown in Figure 6.

   4.3. Multi-homing and Traffic Engineering 

   RANGI proposes a site multi-homing solution using PA locators (shown in Figure 7). 
   Each multi-homed stub LD shall be given an LDID by each ISP. In fact, these LD IDs 
   are /96 IPv6 prefixes which are provider-aggregatable . The hosts within the site, 
   in turn, have multiple locators by concatenating the provider assigned LD ID with 
   the local IPv4 address. The hosts register their locators with the ID/Locator 
   mapping system. As shown in Figure 7, host A has two LDIDs, LDID_1 is allocated 
   from ISP1, while LDID_2 is allocated from ISP2, host A could choose either one as 
   the source LDID of the outgoing packet. Upon receiving the packet, the site exit 
   LDBR BR1 can implement source-based policy routing. For example, if the source LD 
   is LDID_1, the packet will be forwarded into the ISP1's network, otherwise, it 
   will be forwarded into ISP2's network.

          Figure 7.  Site multihoming 
    

   The site-controlled traffic-engineering works as follows: 

   I. The source host sends out a packet using the one of its LDIDs 
        (assuming LDID_1 being used) as the source LD ID. 

   II.           The packet is intercepted by the LDBR BR1 and depending on the 
        traffic-engineering policy, the source LD ID of the packet may 
        be re-written from LDID_1 to LDID_2. Then BR1 forwards the 
        packet into ISP2's network due to source-based policy routing. 

   III. Once the packet arrives at the destination host, that host will 
        use the source LD ID in the received packet as the destination 
        LD ID in the response packets. So the response packet will also 
        enter the site A through the ISP2's network.

Internet-Draft    A Transition Mechanism for RANGI          March 2009 
    

   IV.           The source host could accept this change and use LD ID 2 as the 
        source LD ID in the subsequent packets. 

   In this way, the site-controlled traffic-engineering by rewriting the 
   source LD ID will have effect on the path (upstream ISP) selection 
   for both the outgoing packets and the incoming packets. In addition, 
   the multihoming and traffic-engineering usage in RANGI will not cause 
   the routing table growth.  

   4.4. Mobility 

   In RANGI, when a host physically moves from one attachment to another, 
   its host ID remains unchanged. The host needs to register the new 
   locator with the ID/locator mapping system. Meanwhile, it should 
   notify the corresponding entity of its new locator as soon as 
   possible. 

5. Summary 

   RANGI achieves almost all of goals set by RRG as follows: 

   1. Routing Scalability: Scalability is achieved by separating the 
      identifier and locator. Global routing is done based on provider 
      assigned LD IDs (/96 IPv6 prefixes) of the locators. 

   2. Traffic Engineering: LDBRs can overwrite the prefix part of the 
      source locator and implement source-based policy routing 
      according to the source LD ID.  

   3. Mobility and Multihoming: Applications and transport layers are 
      bound to host IDs and so the sessions will not be interrupted due 
      to mobility or multihoming. 

   4. Simplified Renumbering: When changing providers, the local 
      locators (IPv4 part of the locators) do not change. The IPv4 core 
      routers don't need renumbering. 

   5. Decoupling Location and Identifier: Obvious. 

   6. Routing Quality: Since LDBRs only exchange LD reachability and 
      the topology change within LD will not be disclosed outside, the 
      routing stability could be improved greatly. 

   7. Routing Security: RANGI reuses current routing system and does 
      not introduce any security risk into the routing system.

Internet-Draft    A Transition Mechanism for RANGI          March 2009 
    

   8. Incremental Deployability: Core routers within LD can still be 
      IPv4-only. RANGI allows easy transition from current IPv4 
      networks to future IPv6 networks. 

   It should be pointed out that many of the mechanisms used in RANGI 
   have been proposed earlier in isolated contexts to solve either 
   similar or different problems. RANGI provides a single cohesive 
   architecture that uses all these mechanisms together to provide 
   additional benefits. For example, the idea of embedding IPv4 address 
   in IPv6 address was proposed in ISATAP [19].  Address overwriting at 
   border routers was proposed in GSE [12] and Six/One [20]. 
   Cryptographic addresses are described in CGA [6]. 

   A separate internet draft [26] discusses the details of a new 
   function unit called RANGI proxy that allows RANGI hosts to coexist 
   with all the legacy IPv4 or IPv6 hosts.
